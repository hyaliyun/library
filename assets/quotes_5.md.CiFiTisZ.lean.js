The Famine Stela is an inscription written in Egyptian hieroglyphs located on Sehel Island in the Nile near Aswan in Egypt, which tells of a seven-year period of drought and famine during the reign of pharaoh Djoser of the Third Dynasty. It is thought that the stele was inscribed during the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which ruled from 332 to 31 BC.  Description  The Famine Stela was inscribed into a natural granite block whose surface was cut into the rectangular shape of a stela. The inscription is written in hieroglyphs and contains 42 columns. The top part of the stele depicts three Egyptian deities: Khnum, Satis and Anuket. In front of them, Djoser faces them, carrying offerings in his outstretched hands. A broad fissure, which already was there at the time of creating the stela, goes through the middle of the rock. Some sections of the stela are damaged, making a few passages of the text unreadable. The inscription The story told on the stela is set in the 18th year of the reign of Djoser. The text describes how the king is upset and worried as the land has been in the grip of a drought and famine for seven years, during which time the Nile has not flooded the farmlands. The text also describes how the Egyptians are suffering as a result of the drought and that they are desperate and breaking the laws of the land. Djoser asks the priest staff under the supervision of high lector priest Imhotep for help. The king wants to know where the god of the Nile, Hapi, is born, and which god resides at this place. Imhotep decides to investigate the archives of the temple ·∏•wt-Ibety (‚ÄúHouse of the nets‚Äù), located at Hermopolis and dedicated to the god Thoth. He informs the king that the flooding of the Nile is controlled by the god Khnum at Elephantine from a sacred spring located on the island, where the god resides. Imhotep travels immediately to the location (). In the temple of Khnum, called ‚ÄúJoy of Life‚Äù, Imhotep purifies himself, prays to Khnum for help and offers ‚Äúall good things‚Äù to him. Suddenly he falls asleep and in his dream Imhotep is greeted by the kindly looking Khnum. The god introduces himself to Imhotep by describing who and what he is and then describes his own divine powers. At the end of the dream Khnum promises to make the Nile flow again. Imhotep wakes up and writes down everything that took place in his dream. He then returns to Djoser to tell the king what has happened. The king is pleased with the news and issues a decree in which he orders priests, scribes and workers to restore Khnum¬¥s temple and to once more make regular offerings to the god. In addition, Djoser issues a decree in which he grants the temple of Khnum at Elephantine the region between Aswan and Tachompso () with all its wealth, as well as a share of all the imports from Nubia.Miriam Lichtheim: Ancient Egyptian Literature: The Late Period. University of California Press, Berkeley 2006, , page 94-100. Dating of the inscription Since the initial translation and examination by French Egyptologist Paul Barguet in 1953, the Famine Stela has been of great interest to historians and Egyptologists. The language and layout used in the inscription suggests that the work can be dated to the Ptolemaic period, perhaps during the reign of king Ptolemy V (205 ‚Äì 180 BC). Egyptologists such as Miriam Lichtheim and Werner Vycichl suggest that the local priests of Khnum created the text. The various religious groups in Egypt during Ptolemaic Dynasty jostled for power and influence, so the story of the Famine Stela could have been used as a means to legitimise the power of Khnum's priests over the region of Elephantine.P.

At the time of the first translation of the stela, it was thought that the story of a seven-year-famine was connected to the biblical story in Genesis 41, where a famine of seven years also occurs. More recent investigations have shown that a seven-year famine was a motif common to nearly all cultures of the Near East: a Mesopotamian legend also speaks of a seven-year-famine and in the well known Gilgamesh-Epos the god Anu gives a prophecy about a famine for seven years. Another Egyptian tale about a long- lasting drought appears in the so-called ‚ÄúBook of the Temple‚Äù, translated by German Demotist Joachim Friedrich Quack. The ancient text reports about king Neferkasokar (late 2nd dynasty), who faces a seven-year-famine during his reign.Joachim Friedrich Quack: Ein √§gyptisches Handbuch des Tempels und seine griechische √úbersetzung.

The Famine Stela is one of only three known inscriptions that connect the cartouche name Djeser (‚Äúlordly‚Äù) with the serekh name Netjerikhet (‚Äúdivine body‚Äù) of king Djoser in one word. Therefore, it provides useful evidence for Egyptologists and historians who are involved in reconstructing the royal chronology of the Old Kingdom of Egypt.

It supported candidates for election to the municipal councils and school boards of the six municipalities that made up Metro Toronto. The party was organized by supporters of the social democratic New Democratic Party of Canada, and its provincial wing, the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP). Elections in Toronto and its suburbs, as in other municipalities in the Province of Ontario, have traditionally not been the domain of formal political parties. Candidates for election to municipal councils and school boards typically run as individuals, and not as members of political parties. In the 1970s and 1980s, New Democrats in Metro Toronto attempted to introduce party politics by using campaign materials featuring a \\"Metro NDP\\" logo, and by forming an official NDP caucus on Toronto city council. Not all New Democratic city councillors chose to use the NDP colours and logos, however. Since there was no mechanism for parties to register or to operate officially on the municipal level, the NDP operation was largely informal. Local ward associations were set up to nominate candidates in a number of wards, particularly downtown wards, but no party name ever appeared on a ballot - and there was no mechanism for the Metro NDP to accept election donations. The attempt to introduce party politics had limited success. Most officials elected came from downtown Toronto: only a handful came from the suburbs. In 1991 the Toronto NDP held a convention and nominated Jack Layton as its mayoral candidate - the first and last official NDP nominee for the position although CCFer Jimmy Simpson was Mayor of Toronto in 1935 and NDP member William Dennison was mayor from 1966 to 1972. Layton was unsuccessful in his mayoral run losing to June Rowlands. The growing unpopularity of the Bob Rae government resulted in incumbent NDP councillors and trustees running without a party label in the 1994 municipal election. Thus ended the NDP's formal presence in Toronto municipal politics. A stronger than expected performance by NDP-aligned councillors running as independents provided a strong argument against reviving party affiliations in the 1997 or subsequent elections. While members of the NDP co-operate on city council and on the Toronto District School Board, there is no longer an official NDP caucus. At various times, the Liberals have also attempted to run candidates in Toronto municipal elections, most notably in 1969 when Professor Stephen Clarkson was the nominee of the \\"Civic Liberals\\" for the mayor's office. Clarkson came third. More recently, the name \\"Metro NDP\\" has been revived in order to refer to a regional organization of Ontario NDP provincial riding associations in Toronto rather than to a municipal political party.

(1861). Beitr√§ge zur Physiologie. I. Zur Lehre vom Ortssinne der Netzhaut. Leipzig: Engelmann When two straight and parallel lines are presented in front of radial background (like the spokes of a bicycle), the lines appear as if they were bowed outwards. The Orbison illusion is one of its variants, while the Wundt illusion produces a similar, but inverted effect. There are several possible explanations for why perceptual distortion produced by the radiating pattern. The illusion was ascribed by Hering to an overestimation of the angle made at the points of intersection. If true, then the straightness of the parallel lines yields to that of the radiating lines, implying that there is a hierarchical ordering among components of such illusion. Others have suggested that angle overestimation results from lateral inhibition in visual cortex,Blakemore et al., 1970 while others have postulated a bias inherent in extrapolating 3D angle information from 2D projections.Nundy et al., 2000 A different framework suggests that the Hering illusion (and several other geometric illusions) are caused by temporal delays with which the visual system must cope.Changizi, 2001Changizi and Widders, 2002 In this framework, the visual system extrapolates current information to ‚Äúperceive the present‚Äù: instead of providing a conscious image of how the world was ~100 ms in the past (when signals first struck the retina), the visual system estimates how the world is likely to look in the next moment. In the case of the Hering illusion, the radial lines trick the visual system into thinking it is moving forward. Since we are not actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved‚Äîas they would appear in the next moment. It is possible that both frameworks are compatible. The Hering illusion can also be induced by a background of optic flow (such as dots flowing out from the center of a screen, creating the illusion of forward motion through a starfield). Importantly, the bowing direction is the same whether the flow moves inward or outward. This result is consistent with a role for networks of visual orientation-tuned neurons (e.g., simple cells in primary visual cortex) in the spatial warping. In this framework, under the common condition of forward ego-motion, it is possible that spatial warping counteracts the disadvantage of neural latencies. However, it also demonstrates that any spatial warping that counteracts neural delays is not a precise, on-the-fly computation, but instead a heuristic achieved by a simple mechanism that succeeds under normal circumstances. Researcher Mark Changizi explained the illusion in a 2008 article: > \\"Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us > premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing > point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are > moving forward as we would in the real world, where the door frame (a pair > of vertical lines) seems to bow out as we move through it and we try to > perceive what that world will look like in the next instant.\\" References Category:Optical illusions ","title":"Hering illusion"},{"id":"2175841","text":"Ollie & Jerry was an American dance-pop duo active in the 1980s, consisting of drummer Ollie E.

He is best known today for the Williamson ether synthesis. Life Williamson was born in 1824 in Wandsworth, London, the second of three children of Alexander Williamson (originally from Elgin) a clerk with the East India Company and his wife, Antonia McAndrew, daughter of a prominent London merchant. Despite early physical infirmity, the loss of sight in one eye and a largely useless left arm, Williamson grew up in a caring and stimulating intellectual environment. After an early childhood spent in Brighton and then schools in Kensington, Williams enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1841. After working under Leopold Gmelin at Heidelberg, he transferred to the University of Giessen to work with Justus von Liebig, where he received his Ph.D. in 1845. Williamson then spent three years in Paris studying higher mathematics under Auguste Comte. In 1849, with the support of Thomas Graham, Williamson was appointed professor of analytical and practical chemistry at University College, London. From Graham's resignation in 1855 until Williamson's retirement in 1887, Williamson also held the chair of general (theoretical) chemistry. As a result of this increase in income, he was able to marry Emma Catherine Key, the third daughter of Thomas Hewitt Key, in 1855. They had two children: Oliver Key (d. 1941) and Alice Maude. Alice Maud Williamson married the physicist Alfred Henry Fison (1857‚Äì1923). Williamson died on 6 May 1904, at High Pitfold, Shottermill near Haslemere in Surrey, England, and was buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. Research on ether Alexander Williamson Williamson is credited for his research on the formation of unsymmetrical ethers by the interaction of an alkoxide with a haloalkane, known as the Williamson ether synthesis. He regarded ether and alcohol as substances analogous to and built up on the same type as water, and he further introduced the water-type as a widely applicable basis for the classification of chemical compounds. The method of stating the rational constitution of bodies by comparison with water he believed capable of wide extension, and that one type, he thought, would suffice for all inorganic compounds, as well as for the best-known organic ones, the formula of water being taken in certain cases as doubled or tripled. So far back as 1850 he also suggested a view which, in a modified form, is of fundamental importance in the modern theory of ionic dissociation, for, in a paper on the theory of the formation of ether, he urged that in an aggregate of molecules of any compound there is an exchange constantly going on between the elements which are contained in it; for instance, in hydrochloric acid each atom of hydrogen does not remain quietly in juxtaposition with the atom of chlorine with which it first united, but changes places with other atoms of hydrogen. A somewhat similar hypothesis was put forward by Rudolf Clausius about the same time. Williamson and the Ch≈çsh≈´ Five  In 1863 five students from the Ch≈çsh≈´ clan were smuggled out of Japan. At the time Japan was still a closed society; the laws of the Tokugawa Shogunate making travel to another country a capital offence. After an arduous journey reaching London, the students were placed under the care of Professor Williamson. He and his wife Catherine welcomed the group into their home, taught them English, introduced them to western society, and arranged for them to study as non-matriculated students at University College London. It≈ç Shunsuke (later It≈ç Hirobumi), End≈ç Kinsuke and Nomura Yakichi (later Inoue Masaru) lived with the Williamsons at their Camden home, while Inoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru), and Yamao Y≈çz≈ç lived adjacent to the university in Gower Street. The Ch≈çsh≈´ Five as they later became known all served in the Japanese government, and made significant scientific and social contributions to the modernisation of Japan. Fourteen more international Japanese students, from the Satsuma clan, later worked with Williamson beginning in 1865. Honours and awards Williamson's grave in Brookwood Cemetery For his work on etherification, Williamson received a Royal medal from the Royal Society in 1862, of which he became a fellow in 1855, and which he served as foreign secretary from 1873 to 1889.

Evelyn Thomas scored a chart hit with her first single, reaching the UK Top 30 in 1976 with the single \\"Weak Spot,\\" co-written by Levine and Paul David Wilson . A follow-up single, \\"Doomsday\\", entered the UK charts twice, and Levine and Thomas would continue their association for quite some time. She signed to US label Casablanca Records for her first album release I Wanna Make It on My Own, released 1978. With Casablanca doing little to promote the LP, she switched to AVI Records for the double A-side 12\\" single \\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" / \\"No Time to Turn Around\\" which prompted the label to release it as an LP, backed with Rick Gianatos' extended remixes of her 1976 tracks \\"My Head's in the Stars\\" and \\"Love's Not Just an Illusion\\". For a follow-up, Evelyn Thomas re-recorded three tracks from an aborted project by Levine's group Moonstone, \\"Love in the First Degree\\", \\"Summer on the Beach\\" and \\"Sleaze\\" (originally entitled \\"Out of the Ball Game\\") but with the disco backlash in the US, the tracks were left unreleased. High-NRG Although disco music had been declared \\"dead\\" in the US in a backlash in 1979, several songs which continued and advanced the exuberant surge of uptempo dance music managed to scale the US pop charts in the intervening years, notably Blondie's \\"Call Me\\" in 1980, Laura Branigan's \\"Gloria\\" in 1982, and Irene Cara's \\"Flashdance (What A Feeling)\\" in 1983. Unwilling to use the term \\"disco\\", the phrase \\"high energy\\" had come into usage, probably begun in England in the early 1980s. By 1984 Ian Levine had re-established himself as a producer and asked Evelyn Thomas to come to London to record a new track \\"High Energy\\". Just few weeks after it was released, it zoomed up the charts all over Europe - peaking at No. 1 in Germany and No. 5 in the UKHigh Energy at discogs (Retrieved 15 July 2020). In the US it hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, selling 250,000 copies. The song was her only Billboard Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 85, although three additional songs hit the Billboard dance chart. By 1984, the phrase had become embraced as a term by DJs across Europe and in the States, particularly in gay clubs where DJs who preferred to play records that surpassed a certain BPM (Beats Per Minute) threshold found many mainstream hits lagging in tempo. Evolving around that time to the abbreviated \\"Hi-Energy,\\" the term soon became further shortened to \\"Hi-NRG\\", and was still widely in use more than two decades later to describe a certain genre of uptempo dance music. Later career The follow-up single \\"Masquerade\\" was taken from her third album High Energy, released the same year. While it received heavy rotation in European clubs, it failed to break into the UK Top 40. In the US the song was a top-twenty Dance hit. The following year, \\"Heartless\\" became her only single other than \\"High Energy\\" to chart outside of the Club/Dance charts in the United States. \\"Heartless\\" peaked at No. 84 on the Black Singles chart (later renamed the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart) in 1985. Though she would not return to the US pop or R&B; charts, US dancefloors continued to move to the fast beat of Evelyn Thomas. With a cover of The Supremes' 1967 hit \\"Reflections\\", updated in her Hi-NRG style, Thomas peaked at No. 18 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1986, the same year in which Kim Wilde had a similarly styled hit with the Supremes' \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\". A second Thomas release that summer fared even better on those charts, as \\"How Many Hearts\\" narrowly missed the top 10. The two songs would later appear on Thomas' fourth album release, Standing at the Crossroads, in 1987. In late 1987, the single \\"No Win Situation\\" shot to No. 1 on the now defunct UK Hi-NRG Charts. late 80s she released dance singles such as \\"Only Once in a Lifetime\\" (1988) and \\"This Is Madness\\" (1989). In spring 1997, Redemption featuring Evelyn Thomas had a minor US club hit with the track \\"Tell The World\\". Comeback in the 2000s The remix was released on Dance Street/ZYX Records out of Germany in early 2005. The remix secured moderate radio and club play on the Stateside. In May 2008, Evelyn Thomas took part in the major RTL Disco Tour, performing in 15 cities throughout France. While in Europe, Thomas completed several new recordings in different countries with the aim of making a comeback. She has teamed up with Ian Levine for the first time in 20 years, recording the tracks \\"Pounding the Pavement\\", \\"One in a Million\\" and \\"I Can't Give You the World\\". She has recorded four tracks, \\"Stick to the Plan\\", \\"Missing the Target\\", \\"Infidelity\\" and the ballad \\"Why Must the Sunrise\\" for a diva album called The Plan for Night Dance Records, produced by Scandinavian songwriter S√∏ren Jensen in collaboration with Clive Scott, formerly of Jigsaw. Thomas has also teamed up with French team Evolusound for a single release, \\"Prove It\\", written and produced by Frank Savannah and remixed by Laurent Schark. In 2009, Thomas released a duet with Carol Jiani, \\"Are You Man Enough\\".

Its capital and largest city is Moyamba. The other major towns include Njala, Rotifunk and Shenge. The district is the largest in the Southern Province by geographical area, occupying a total area of and comprises fourteen chiefdoms. Moyamba District borders the Atlantic Ocean in the west, Port Loko District and Tonkolili District to the north, Bo District to the east and Bonthe District to the south. The main economic activities include mining (rutile and bauxite), fishing, rice growing and oil palm plantations. Moyamba District is one of the most ethnically diverse Districts in Sierra Leone. The Mende people are the largest ethnic group in Moyamba District; However, there is a large population of ethnic minority groups in the district that make up closer to 50% of the District population, including the Temne people, Fulani, Sherbro, Kissi, Mandingo, and Kuranko. Moyamba is home to a significantly large population of ethnic Temne minority, and is home to the largest ethnic Temne population in the Southern Province of Sierra Leone. Moyamba District is the birthplace of many of the country's highest profile politicians who helped guide the country to independence in 1961 from the United Kingdom, including Milton Margai, Albert Margai, John Karefa-Smart and Siaka Stevens. Politically, Moyamba District is a stronghold of the Sierra Leone People's Party(SLPP), as the vast majority of residents in the District support the SLPP. The SLPP has won every presidential election in Moyamba District including the 1996, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential elections.

The AIP is made up of various member societies. Its corporate headquarters are at the American Center for Physics in College Park, Maryland, but the institute also has offices in Melville, New York, and Beijing. Core activities The focus of the AIP appears to be organized around a set of core activities. The first delineated activity is to support member societies regarding essential society functions. This is accomplished by annually convening the various society officers to discuss common areas of concern. A range of topics is discussed which includes scientific publishing, public policy issues, membership-base issues, philanthropic giving, science education, science careers for a diverse population, and a forum for sharing ideas. Another core activity is publishing the science of physics in research journals, magazines, and conference proceedings. Member societies continue nevertheless to publish their own journals. Other core activities are tracking employment and education trends with six decades of coverage, being a liaison between research science and industry, historical collections and physics outreach programs, and supporting science education initiatives and supporting undergraduate physics. One other core activity is as an advocate for science policy to the U.S. Congress and the general public. Historical overview The AIP was founded in 1931 as a response to lack of funding for the sciences during the Great Depression. It formally incorporated in 1932 consisting of five original \\"member societies\\", and a total of four thousand members. A new set of member societies was added beginning in the mid-1960s.

He is the namesake of Jarn√≠k's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. Jarn√≠k worked in number theory, mathematical analysis, and graph algorithms. He has been called \\"probably the first Czechoslovak mathematician whose scientific works received wide and lasting international response\\". As well as developing Jarn√≠k's algorithm, he found tight bounds on the number of lattice points on convex curves, studied the relationship between the Hausdorff dimension of sets of real numbers and how well they can be approximated by rational numbers, and investigated the properties of nowhere-differentiable functions. Education and career Jarn√≠k was born December 22, 1897. He was the son of , a professor of Romance language philology at Charles University,, p. 168. and his older brother, Hertv√≠k Jarn√≠k, also became a professor of linguistics.. Despite this background, Jarn√≠k learned no Latin at his gymnasium (the C.K. ƒçesk√© vy≈°≈°√≠ re√°ln√© gymnasium, Jeƒçn√°, Prague), so when he entered Charles University in 1915 he had to do so as an extraordinary student until he could pass a Latin examination three semesters later. He studied mathematics and physics at Charles University from 1915 to 1919, with Karel Petr as a mentor. After completing his studies, he became an assistant to Jan Vojtƒõch at the Brno University of Technology, where he also met Mathias Lerch. In 1921 he completed a doctoral degree (RNDr.) at Charles University with a dissertation on Bessel functions supervised by Petr, then returned to Charles University as Petr's assistant. While keeping his position at Charles University, he studied with Edmund Landau at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1929. and ; however, O'Connor and Robertson give his return dates as 1924 and 1928. On his first return to Charles University he defended his habilitation, and on his return from the second visit, he was given a chair in mathematics as an extraordinary professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1935 and later served as Dean of Sciences (1947‚Äì1948) and Vice-Rector (1950‚Äì1953). He retired in 1968. Jarn√≠k supervised the dissertations of 16 doctoral students. Notable among these are Miroslav Katƒõtov, a chess master who became rector of Charles University, Jaroslav Kurzweil, known for the Henstock‚ÄìKurzweil integral, and Slovak mathematician Tibor ≈†al√°t., He died September 22, 1970. Contributions Although Jarn√≠k's 1921 dissertation, like some of his later publications, was in mathematical analysis, his main area of work was in number theory. He studied the Gauss circle problem and proved a number of results on Diophantine approximation, lattice point problems, and the geometry of numbers. He also made pioneering, but long- neglected, contributions to combinatorial optimization. =Number theory= A convex curve through 13 integer lattice points The Gauss circle problem asks for the number of points of the integer lattice enclosed by a given circle. One of Jarn√≠k's theorems (1926), related to this problem, is that any convex curve with length passes through at most :\\\\frac{3}{\\\\sqrt[3]{2\\\\pi}}L^{2/3}+O(L^{1/3}) points of the integer lattice. The O in this formula is an instance of Big O notation. Neither the exponent of nor the leading constant of this bound can be improved, as there exist convex curves with this many grid points... Another theorem of Jarn√≠k in this area shows that, for any closed convex curve in the plane with a well-defined length, the absolute difference between the area it encloses and the number of integer points it encloses is at most its length.. Jarn√≠k also published several results in Diophantine approximation, the study of the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. He proved (1928‚Äì1929) that the badly approximable real numbers (the ones with bounded terms in their continued fractions) have Hausdorff dimension one. This is the same dimension as the set of all real numbers, intuitively suggesting that the set of badly approximable numbers is large. He also considered the numbers for which there exist infinitely many good rational approximations , with :\\\\left x-\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right<\\\\frac{1}{q^k} for a given exponent , and proved (1929) that these have the smaller Hausdorff dimension . The second of these results was later rediscovered by Besicovitch.. Besicovitch used different methods than Jarn√≠k to prove it, and the result has come to be known as the Jarn√≠k‚ÄìBesicovitch theorem.. See Theorem 1.33 (the Jarn√≠k‚ÄìBesicovitch theorem), p. 23, and the discussion following the theorem. =Mathematical analysis= Jarn√≠k's work in real analysis was sparked by finding, in the unpublished works of Bernard Bolzano, a definition of a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable. Bolzano's 1830 discovery predated the 1872 publication of the Weierstrass function, previously considered to be the first example of such a function. Based on his study of Bolzano's function, Jarn√≠k was led to a more general theorem: If a real-valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval, then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its Dini derivatives is infinite. This applies in particular to the nowhere-differentiable functions, as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals. Later, after learning of a result by Stefan Banach and Stefan Mazurkiewicz that generic functions (that is, the members of a residual set of functions) are nowhere differentiable, Jarn√≠k proved that at almost all points, all four Dini derivatives of such a function are infinite. Much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives.. =Combinatorial optimization= Animation of Jarn√≠k's algorithm for minimum spanning trees In computer science and combinatorial optimization, Jarn√≠k is known for an algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees that he published in 1930, in response to the publication of Bor≈Øvka's algorithm by another Czech mathematician, Otakar Bor≈Øvka.. See in particular page 127: \\"Soon after Bor≈Øvka's published his solution, another Czech mathematician, Vojtƒõch Jarn√≠k, reacted by publishing his own solution,\\" and page 133: \\"Jarn√≠k‚Äôs article on this topic is an extract from a letter to O. Bor≈Øvka\\". Jarn√≠k's algorithm builds a tree from a single starting vertex of a given weighted graph by repeatedly adding the cheapest connection to any other vertex, until all vertices have been connected. The same algorithm was later rediscovered in the late 1950s by Robert C. Prim and Edsger W. Dijkstra. It is also known as Prim's algorithm or the Prim‚ÄìDijkstra algorithm.. He also published a second, related, paper with (1934) on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. In this problem, one must again form a tree connecting a given set of points, with edge costs given by the Euclidean distance. However, additional points that are not part of the input may be added to make the overall tree shorter. This paper is the first serious treatment of the general Steiner tree problem (although it appears earlier in a letter by Gauss), and it already contains \\"virtually all general properties of Steiner trees\\" later attributed to other researchers.. Recognition and legacy Jarn√≠k was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, from 1934 as an extraordinary member and from 1946 as a regular member. In 1952 he became one of the founding members of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize in 1952. Jarn√≠kova Street, the Jarn√≠kova bus stop, and a commemorative sign honoring Jarn√≠k The Vojtƒõch Jarn√≠k International Mathematical Competition, held each year since 1991 in Ostrava, is named in his honor, as is Jarn√≠kova Street in the Chodov district of Prague. A series of postage stamps published by Czechoslovakia in 1987 to honor the 125th anniversary of the Union of Czechoslovak mathematicians and physicists included one stamp featuring Jarn√≠k together with Joseph Petzval and Vincenc Strouhal.. A conference was held in Prague, in March 1998, to honor the centennial of his birth.. Selected publications Jarn√≠k published 90 papers in mathematics,. including: *. A function with unbounded variation in all intervals has a dense set of points where a Dini derivative is infinite. *. Tight bounds on the number of integer points on a convex curve, as a function of its length. *. The badly-approximable numbers have Hausdorff dimension one. *. The well-approximable numbers have Hausdorff dimension less than one. *. The original reference for Jarnik's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. *. Generic functions have infinite Dini derivatives at almost all points. *. The first serious treatment of the Steiner tree problem. He was also the author of ten textbooks in Czech, on integral calculus, differential equations, and mathematical analysis. These books \\"became classics for several generations of students\\"..

It runs from PA 873 in the North Whitehall Township village of Neffs east to PA 248 and PA 987 in Bath. The route is a two-lane undivided road that runs through a mix of rural and developed areas to the north of the cities of Allentown and Bethlehem, serving the communities of Balliettsville, Egypt, Cementon, and Northampton. PA 329 intersects PA 145 near Egypt and runs concurrent with PA 987 between East Allen Township and the eastern terminus in Bath. PA 329 was originally designated in 1928 to run from Egypt south to U.S. Route 22 (US 22), US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 in Center City Allentown while the alignment between Cementon and Bath was designated as part of PA 145 in 1928. By 1940, the route was realigned to a new alignment in Whitehall Township. In 1941, PA 145 and PA 329 switched alignments, with PA 329 heading east to PA 45 (now PA 248) and PA 987 in Bath and PA 145 heading south to US 22, US 309, and PA 29 in Allentown. PA 329 was also extended west to US 309 (now PA 873) in Neffs and a branch of the route was designated between Balliettsville and US 309/PA 29 and US 309 Byp. at the northern edge of Allentown. The section of PA 329 between Balliettsville and Allentown was decommissioned by 1950. Route description PA 329 westbound in North Whitehall Township PA 329 begins at an intersection with PA 873 in the community of Neffs in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley. From this intersection, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Bellview Road past housing developments, soon passing under Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) and crossing Coplay Creek. After this, the road curves east into agricultural areas with a few homes, with PA 329 making a turn southeast onto Old Post Road. The route makes a curve to the east again as it continues through more farmland with scattered residential subdivisions, passing through the community of Balliettsville. Upon entering Whitehall Township, the road becomes Main Street and passes through the residential community of Egypt before continuing past more homes and reaching the PA 145 junction. From this point, PA 329 continues northeast through residential areas and passes through the community of Cementon. Upon crossing the Lehigh River on a truss bridge, PA 329 enters the borough of Northampton in Northampton County and becomes 21st Street, crossing Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line as it heads into commercial areas. After crossing Main Street, the route is lined with homes before it crosses the Hokendauqua Creek into Allen Township and continues east. At this point, the name of the road becomes Nor- Bath Boulevard and it passes between a quarry and a lake to the north and industrial areas to the south before entering farmland. PA 329 briefly passes homes after the Howertown Road junction in the community of Howertown, crossing into East Allen Township at the Seemsville Road intersection and heading across Catasauqua Creek. The route continues through agricultural areas with some housing before reaching the PA 987 junction in Franks Corner. At this point, PA 987 forms a concurrency with PA 329, with the two routes continuing east through Jacksonville before turning northeast and passing to the east of a quarry. The road passes near a cement plant before it heads into the borough of Bath. Here, the road becomes Race Street and passes through woods before heading into residential areas. PA 329 reaches its eastern terminus at the PA 248 intersection, where PA 987 makes a turn east to follow PA 248. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 329 was legislated as part of Legislative Route 175 from east of Northampton to Bath. By 1926, the roadway between Northampton and Bath was paved. The present route between Cementon and Bath was designated as the eastern part of PA 145 in 1928. PA 329 was designated in 1928 to run from Egypt south to US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at 7th and Hamilton streets in Allentown. The route followed its current alignment east to Cementon, where it headed south on Coplay Road to Coplay and then continued along Mickley Pike through Whitehall Township before entering Allentown on 7th Street. In the 1930s, PA 329 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike (now MacArthur Road) through Whitehall Township. The Seventh Street Pike was built starting in the later part of the 1920s to provide a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township. The road between Allentown and Mickleys church was widened to three lanes in the 1930s. Also, the southern terminus was cut back to US 22, US 309, and PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown in the 1930s, with US 309/PA 29 replacing the route along 7th Street between Tilghman and Hamilton streets. In 1941, PA 329 was realigned to follow its current alignment between US 309 (now PA 873) in Neffs and PA 45 (now PA 248) and PA 987 in Bath, replacing the PA 145 designation between Cementon and Bath. PA 145 was realigned to follow the former alignment of PA 329 along Seventh Street Pike and 7th Street into Allentown. Another alignment designated PA 329 branched from the route in Balliettsville and headed southeast along Mauch Chunk Road and 18th Street to US 309/PA 29 and US 309 Byp. at the intersection of 19th Street and Main Boulevard on the northern edge of Allentown. By 1950, the branch of PA 329 from Balliettsville to Allentown was decommissioned. Major intersections PA 329 Truck Pennsylvania Route 329 Truck is a truck route of PA 329 around the weight-restricted bridge over the Lehigh River, on which trucks over 25 tons and combination loads over 30 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 145, US 22, and PA 987. It was signed in 2013.

Crystals are minute and capillary and rarely met with, the mineral occurring usually as soft earthy masses and encrustations. A fine apple-green color is its characteristic feature. It was long known (since 1758) under the name nickel bloom; the name annabergite was proposed by H. J. Brooke and W H. Miller in 1852, from Annaberg in Saxony, one of the localities of the mineral. It occurs with ores of nickel, of which it is a product of alteration. A variety, from Creetown in Kirkcudbrightshire, in which a portion of the nickel is replaced by calcium, has been called dudgeonite, after P. Dudgeon, who found it. Annabergite from Lavrion (Laurium), Greece Closely related is cabrerite wherein some of the nickel is replaced by magnesium. It is named for Sierra Cabrera in Spain where it was originally found.

Released in 2005 by Columbia Records, it was originally distributed through an exclusive 18-month deal with Starbucks, after which it was released to the general retail market. The album release coincided with the release of the documentary No Direction Home: Bob Dylan (and accompanying 26-song soundtrack).  Background  The performances documented on Live at The Gaslight 1962 were recorded early in Dylan's career, during the hiatus between his first and second albums, when Dylan was still virtually unknown outside Greenwich Village. These performances occurred sometime in October 1962 at The Gaslight Cafe, self-proclaimed for hosting ‚Äúthe best entertainment in the Village.‚Äù The Gaslight was considered one of the premiere performance venues for the era‚Äôs new wave of folk singers, serving as a springboard for Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Dylan and others. Dylan‚Äôs performances were recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder patched into the house PA system and operated by sound engineer Richard Alderson, who would later handle the sound for Dylan‚Äôs 1966 tour. These Gaslight recordings have circulated among Dylan collectors for many years. They made their first appearance on bootleg LPs no later than 1973 , and have appeared, in various forms, on several bootleg LPs and CDs and on many Dylan fan CDR projects. The full set of recordings, including 17 tracks, is usually referred to by Dylan collectors as the \\"Second Gaslight Tape\\", but some refer to the recordings as a compilation of the \\"Second\\" and \\"Third Gaslight Tape\\", believing them to be compiled from two different sets at The Gaslight (noting differences in sound quality).Dylan, Bob. Live at The Gaslight 1962. Liner Notes by Sean Wilentz. Columbia/Legacy A96016, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, 2005, compact disc.  Previous Releases  Two tracks from these recordings were previously released on official Dylan albums: \\"No More Auction Block\\" appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991 in 1991 and \\"Handsome Molly\\" appeared on the Japanese release Live 1961‚Äì2000: Thirty-Nine Years of Great Concert Performances. A third track, \\"The Cuckoo\\", was one of six songs included on a promotional CD distributed in U.S. retail markets in association with the official release of Dylan's memoir, Chronicles, Volume 1 in 2004. Songs Live at The Gaslight 1962 captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" (often referred to as \\"Hard Rain\\"), \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\", and \\"John Brown\\". Both \\"Hard Rain\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" would eventually appear on Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\", in May 1963. Around the same time, a studio version of \\"John Brown\\" was included on the Folkways Records compilation Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1 in February 1963, but it would not be released on any of Dylan's subsequent studio albums (much later the song would re-appear as a live performance on Dylan's 1995 MTV Unplugged album.) \\"Rocks and Gravel\\", also credited as a Bob Dylan composition, is Dylan's own adaptation of Brownie McGhee's \\"Solid Road\\" and Leroy Carr's \\"Alabama Woman\\", an arrangement that fuses both songs into one. It was originally slated to appear on Dylan's second album (and later appeared on test pressings made for a preliminary version of the LP), but when Dylan reconfigured The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, he omitted \\"Rocks And Gravel\\" from the final album sequence. The remaining songs on Live at The Gaslight 1962 show off the young Dylan‚Äôs already-broad knowledge of traditional folk songs. These include, among others, ‚ÄúThe Cuckoo‚Äù, which was recorded as early as the 1920‚Äôs by western North Carolina banjo musician Clarence Ashley; ‚ÄúMoonshiner‚Äù, a traditional song that had also been performed by Irish folksters The Clancy Brothers (playing together with Pete Seeger) as well as by Appalachian folk singer Roscoe Holcomb; and ‚ÄúBarbara Allen‚Äù LINK, described by music historian Dave Marsh as ‚Äúthe most widespread folk song in the English language.‚ÄùWilentz, S., & Marcus, G., Editors (2005). The rose & the briar: death, love and liberty in the American ballad. New York: W.W. Norton. p. 9  Critical Reception  Even before the release of the official album, the recordings of the October 1962 cafe performances were well-reviewed. According to bobsboots.com, a website devoted to documenting Dylan bootlegs, the Gaslight recordings are considered ‚Äúa ‚Äòmust have‚Äô to any serious collection.‚Äù In preparation for the 2005 Columbia release, the recordings were re-engineered, rendering the songs ‚Äúconsiderably clearer than their bootleg versions,‚Äù according to music critic WIlliam Ruhlmann, yet still retaining ‚Äútheir unofficial quality, with occasional flaws.‚Äù Entertainment Weekly‚Äôs David Browne gave the Columbia issue an A- grade, stating, ‚ÄúGaslight is a spellbinding reminder that Dylan was never a typical folkie (or typical anything, for that matter.)‚Äù Sean Wilentz, who wrote the liner notes for the CD (and which he would much expand on in his 2010 book Dylan in America), notes that, ‚Äúfor all of its unpretentious, even impromptu qualities,‚Äù the Gaslight recordings show ‚Äúhow greatly and rapidly Dylan‚Äôs creativity was growing.‚Äù Controversy The choice to release the Gaslight recordings initially through an exclusive deal with the corporate coffee giant Starbucks outraged some fans, who cited this as one more example of Dylan ‚Äúselling out.‚Äù Many music retailers were upset as well, since Starbucks had exclusive rights to sell the release CD for 18 months. Large music retailer HMV Canada responded by pulling all Bob Dylan products off their shelves in protest. (HMV Canada had taken a similar stance with the Starbucks-exclusive release of Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\\", removing all of the artist's catalog from their shelves.) Afterwards, in order to appease frustrated HMV customers, Columbia offered the Live at The Gaslight 1962 CD as a free giveaway with any Bob Dylan purchase at HMV stores.

It runs from PA 662 in Richmond Township, Berks County northeast to PA 309 near New Tripoli in Lehigh County. The route passes through rural areas, intersecting Interstate 78 (I-78)/U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Lenhartsville, PA 737 near Kempton, and PA 863 in Lynnport. What is now PA 143 north of Lenhartsville was originally designated Legislative Route 285 in 1911. PA 143 was designated to in 1928 to run from PA 43 in Lenhartsville to PA 29 near New Tripoli. The route was extended slightly east through New Tripoli by 1940 following a realignment of PA 29\\\\. PA 143 was extended south to PA 662 in 1962. Route description PA 143 northbound in Virginville PA 143 begins at an intersection with PA 662 in Richmond Township, Berks County, heading to the north on two-lane undivided Hard Hill Road. It turns northwest through a mix of hilly farms and woods with some homes, reaching the community of Virginville and becoming Main Street. In Virginville, the road crosses the Maiden Creek at the confluence with Sacony Creek into Perry Township, where it runs a short distance to the west of the Maiden Creek with woods to the east and farm fields to the west as an unnamed road. PA 143 continues through rural surroundings as it passes through Windsor Township and into Greenwich Township. The road enters more wooded surroundings and makes a few sharp turns prior to heading west into the borough of Lenhartsville. Here, the road becomes Chestnut Street and passes homes and businesses. The route intersects East Penn Street (Old Route 22) and heads west on East Penn Street for a short distance before turning north onto Willow Street. Upon leaving Lenhartsville for Greenwich Township again, PA 143 becomes unnamed and reaches an interchange with I-78/US 22\\\\. From this point, the road winds north through more forested areas, still running to the west of Maiden Creek. The route enters Albany Township and enters a mix of woods and farms as it comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 737 near the community of Kempton. Following this intersection, the road passes through more rural areas as it runs to the west of Ontelaunee Creek and the Wanamaker, Kempton and Southern Railroad. PA 143 southbound in New Tripoli PA 143 crosses into Lynn Township in Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, and continues northeast to the community of Wanamakers as Kings Highway. At this point, the road turns more to the east and passes the terminus of the Wanamaker, Kempton and Southern Railroad as it heads into more agricultural areas with some homes. The route curves northeast and runs through the community of Jacksonville before it turns to the east. Upon reaching the community of Lynnport, PA 143 comes to the northern terminus of PA 863\\\\. From this intersection, the route continues farther east, curving southeast and crossing Ontelaunee Creek. PA 143 turns east and passes through New Tripoli as Decatur Street before reaching its northern terminus at PA 309. In 2015, PA 143 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 2,700 vehicles between PA 863 and PA 309 to a low of 1,000 vehicles between PA 662 and I-78/US 22. None of PA 143 is part of the National Highway System. History What is now PA 143 north of Lenhartsville was designated as part of Legislative Route 285, a legislative route that ran from Hamburg to New Tripoli, in 1911. PA 143 was designated in 1928 to follow its current alignment from PA 43 (now Old Route 22) in Lenhartsville northeast to PA 29 west of New Tripoli. The route was originally unpaved between Lenhartsville and Kempton while the section between Kempton and New Tripoli was paved. By 1940, PA 143 was paved between Lenhartsville and Kempton. Also by this time, PA 143 was extended through New Tripoli to end at PA 29 (now PA 309) to the east of the community following a realignment of PA 29. PA 143 was extended south from Lenhartsville to its current southern terminus at PA 662 on March 8, 1962.

He served as the 19th Attorney General of California for the lengthy span of 37 years. Webb's parents were Cyrus Webb, a Civil War captain, and Eliza Cather Webb. He was born in West Virginia and educated in Kansas, and later moved to Quincy, California. There, he gained admittance to the State Bar of California and was elected Plumas County District Attorney, in which position he served for 12 years (1890‚Äì1902). He was appointed Attorney General of California by Governor Henry Gage in 1902, and elected to a full term later that year. Webb served as attorney general for 37 years, from 1902 to 1939 (9 terms), and is one of the longest-serving statewide officials in American history. He began a lengthy series of lawsuits to prove the state held title, in trust for the people of California, to tide and submerged lands, for public access and use for navigation, shipping and commerce. His administration served to clarify new legislation involving elections, motor vehicles, and criminal trial procedures. (The Criminal Law Division has since exploded its workload‚ÄîWebb reported in his 1914‚Äì16 Biennial Report a criminal case load of 307 appeals in two years, whereas today more than 6,000 appeals are received annually). Webb also vigorously prosecuted land transfers made to avoid enforcement of the California Alien Land Law of 1913 that prohibited ownership of land in California by Chinese, Japanese, and other Asians who were ineligible for naturalized citizenship. In the 1930s, Webb's office pressured Fish and Game authorities to go after aliens with commercial fishermen's licenses and prevent offloading of fish at the port of San Diego. On September 18, 1934, Judge C.N. Andrews ruled that residence requirements were a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Webb appealed to the Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court, both of which also ruled that residence requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment. California governor Gray Davis apologized in 2003 for Webb's zealous progressive-promoted sterilization program under the state's eugenics policy. Personal life Webb married Grace Goodwin, the daughter of Judge J. D. and Martha Goodwin of Quincy. The Webbs had three children, Hester, Sigel Goodwin and Grace. Webb belonged to the Masonic and Knights of Pythias fraternities and to the Union League Club. He died in San Francisco on July 31, 1947. References External links *Ulysses S.

Two submarines of this class, Nordenfelt II (Abd√ºlhamid, 1886) and Nordenfelt III (Abd√ºlmecid, 1887) joined the Ottoman fleet. They were built in pieces by Des Vignes (Chertsey) and Vickers (Sheffield) in England, and assembled at the Ta≈ükƒ±zak Naval Shipyard in Istanbul, Turkey. Thorsten Nordenfelt (1 March 1842 ‚Äì 8 February 1920), was a Swedish inventor and industrialist. Nordenfelt was born in √ñrby outside Kinna, Sweden, the son of a colonel. The surname was and is often spelled Nordenfeldt, though Thorsten and his brothers always spelled it Nordenfelt, and the 1881 Census shows it as Nordenfelt. The family home in that year was Leinster Lodge on the Uxbridge Road, Paddington in west London. Thorsten worked for a Swedish company in London from 1862 to 1866 and migrated to England in 1867 when he married Emma Stansfeld Grundy. Thorsten Nordenfelt and his brother-in-law started a small business to trade Swedish steel for British rails in 1887. Later on he founded Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, ltd to develop a machine-gun designed by Helge Palmcrantz that would be referred to as the Nordenfelt gun. His company also designed a range of anti- torpedoboat guns in calibres from 37 to 57 mm, that were produced in Erith, Kent, Stockholm and Spain. Under pressure from Rothschild and Vickers his company merged with Maxim's in 1888 to form The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company. After a personal bankruptcy Nordenfelt was forced out of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Soci√©t√© Nordenfelt, designed the eccentric screw breech used on the French 75. Legal action followed (Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd) over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed. In 1903 he returned to Sweden and retired. In 1902 a public house named after Thorsten Nordenfelt was built at 181 Erith Road, Erith just along from the Gun and Carriage works of Vickers, Sons and Maxim (previously Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company) . Named 'The Nordenfelt Tavern' it was built to the design of Jonathan G. Ensor (1852/3-19??), architect for brewer Watney Combe & ReidJames Packer 'Bexley Pubs' Submarines Discussions between Thorsten Nordenfelt and the English reverend George Garrett led to the production of a series of steam-powered submarines. The first was the Nordenfelt I, a 56-tonne, 19.5-metre long vessel similar to Garret's ill-fated Resurgam (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres and armed with a single torpedo and a 25.4 mm machine gun. It was manufactured by Bolinders in Stockholm in 1884‚Äì1885. Like the Resurgam, it operated on the surface using a 100 HP steam engine with a maximum speed of 9 kn, then it shut down its engine to dive. She was purchased by the Greek Government and was delivered to Salamis Naval Base in 1886. Following the acceptance tests, she was never used again by the Hellenic Navy and was scrapped in 1901. Nordenfelt then built the Nordenfelt II (Abd√ºl Hamid) in 1886 and Nordenfelt III (Abd√ºl Mecid) in 1887, a pair of 30-metre long submarines with twin torpedo tubes, for the Ottoman Navy. Abd√ºl Hamid became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water.Submarine Heritage Centre - submarine history of Barrow-in-Furness Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the Nordenfelt IV which had twin motors and twin torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped. Abd√ºlhamid and Abd√ºlmecid were in Istanbul in 1914. The submarines were briefly considered for use in harbour defence but it was found that their hulls were too badly corroded.

An institution of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, Carmel Catholic is one of three Carmelite-run high schools in the Chicago area, the others being Joliet Catholic High School and Mount Carmel High School. History In the early 1960s, the Carmelites and the Sisters of Charity were asked to build separate but similar Catholic high schools for the northern part of the Archdiocese of Chicago; an area corresponding roughly to Lake County. The boys school opened in 1962, with the girls school opening the next year. Following a lengthy planning process, the decision was made by the Carmelites and the BVM Sisters to combine the two schools and establish a Board of Directors. This was done beginning in the 1988-89 school year.

The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University is named after him, as is the Fuqua School in Farmville, Virginia. A bust of J.B. Fuqua in the Hall of Flags at the Fuqua School of Business Early years and education John Brooks Elam Jr. was born on June 26, 1918 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, to John B. (November 15, 1890 - ) and Ruth Fuqua Elam (July 31, 1892 - September 7, 1918). His mother died two months after his birth; he was adopted by his maternal grandparents, who raised him on a small tobacco farm, and changed his last name to Fuqua. He graduated from Prospect high school, in Prospect, Virginia. Fuqua formed a number of successful business conglomerates. After listening to WRVA from an early age, he pursued his interest in radio by earning his commercial operator's license at age 17. As an adolescent, Fuqua educated himself by requesting books from the Duke University Library to be mailed to his farm. He credited Duke's lending program with enabling him to learn about business techniques. Business and politics From the 1950s to the 1990s, Fuqua developed several businesses, such as Snapper lawnmower dealerships; multiple media outlets, including WJBF- TV, a TV station named for his initials, in Augusta, Georgia; real estate; insurance; banking; soft drink manufacturing; and auto finance, under the name Fuqua Industries. In 1989 J.B. Fuqua retired as chairman from Fuqua Industries, selling stock he had in the company. In 1993, Fuqua paid $1 million to Fuqua Industries to remove his name from the company he had started, and was no longer connected to. His former company renamed itself to Actava Group, which later merged into Metromedia International.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1996-05-12/fuquas-new- guise-and-old-gusto In 1989, Fuqua acquired 35 percent of Vista Resources, renaming it Fuqua Enterprises in 1995.

Fuqua was active in politics for much of his life. On November 7, 1957 he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, to fill the unexpired term of Richard Lee Chambers III, who had resigned on October 10. This was during the period of the County Unit System in Georgia, so that Fuqua was one of three House members representing Richmond County. He was re-elected to two additional full terms in the House, before running for a seat in the State Senate. In 1962, Fuqua was elected to the Georgia Senate, taking office in January 1963, in a district previously represented by Carl Sanders. He served one term in the State Senate. From 1962 to 1966, Fuqua chaired the Democratic Party of Georgia. He was a close friend and supporter of presidents Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, and former Savannah Mayor and billionaire Julius Curtis Lewis Jr.. Legacy In the 1970s, Fuqua demonstrated his considerable gratitude to Duke University by donating $10 million to its business school, which was subsequently renamed after him, becoming the Fuqua School of Business. His giving to the university totaled almost $40 million. He is an honorary alumnus of Duke. In 1974, Fuqua received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1986, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from Oglethorpe University. Another of Fuqua's philanthropic projects was the Fuqua School in Farmville, Virginia, formerly the Prince Edward Academy. His gift of $10 million in 1993 and a subsequent donation of over $2 million were pledged with the goal of transforming the school from a small private institution on the verge of bankruptcy into a model for rural pre-K-12 education. In February 1995, Fuqua donated $3 million to the Heart Center of Atlanta to honor his wife, Dorothy, on their 50th wedding anniversary. To recognize his generosity, the program was renamed the Fuqua Heart Center of Atlanta. In 1999, Mr. Fuqua contributed another $3 million to the Fuqua Heart Center to implement cardiac education programs for patients, their families, and the community, and in 2008 the J.B. Fuqua Trust awarded a $5 million bequest, which represented the largest estate gift to Piedmont Hospital in its 102-year history and demonstrated the Fuqua family's ongoing commitment both to the Fuqua heart center and to heart care at Piedmont Hospital. The bequest enables the Fuqua Heart Center to maintain the latest technology as advancements are made and to support educational and scientific programs.

It originally consisted of senior commanders, like Sir Thomas Fairfax, and representatives elected by their regiments, known as Agitators. Following the Putney Debates of October to November 1647, Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton grew concerned by their radicalism, and in 1648, Agitators were removed from the Council. Now dominated by the so- called Grandees, it became the Council of Officers. Background Charles I; by 1648, a significant element felt only his death could end the conflict When the First English Civil War began in 1642, the vast majority on both sides believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was divinely mandated. They disagreed on what 'well-ordered' meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Puritans believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations. However, 'Puritan' was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different perspectives. Presbyterians were the most prominent in the Long Parliament; in general, they wanted to convert the Church of England into a Presbyterian body, similar to the Church of Scotland. Independents opposed any state church, and although smaller in number, included Cromwell, as well as much of the New Model Army. Having established control of Scotland in the 1639 to 1640 Bishops Wars, the Covenanters viewed the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant with Parliament as a way to preserve it, by preventing Royalist victory in England. As the war progressed, they and their English co-religionists came to see the Independents, and their political allies like the Levellers, as a greater threat to the established order than the Royalists. In 1646, many Parliamentarians assumed military defeat would force Charles I to agree terms, but this was a fundamental misunderstanding of his character. Charles refused to agree any substantial concessions, frustrating allies and opponents alike. General Council Having won the First English Civil War, the soldiers of the New Model Army (Army) became very discontented with the Long Parliament, for several reasons. Firstly, they had not been paid regularly and on the end of hostilities, the conservative MPs in Parliament wanted to either disband the Army or send them to fight in Ireland without receiving their back pay. Secondly, since most Parliamentarians wanted to restore the King without major democratic reforms or religious freedom, many soldiers asked why they had risked their lives in the first place ‚Äì a sentiment that was strongly expressed by their elected representatives. Two representatives, called Agitators, were elected from each regiment. The Agitators with two Army Officers from each regiment and the Generals formed a new body called the Army Council which after a rendezvous (meeting) near Newmarket on Friday 4 June 1647 issued \\"A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax\\" to Parliament on 8 June making their concerns known and also the constitution of the Army Council so that Parliament would understand that the discontent was Army wide and had the support of officers and other ranks. This Engagement was read out to the Army at a general Army rendezvous on 5 June. Having come under the influence of London radicals called the Levellers, the troops of the Army proposed a revolutionary new constitution named the Agreement of the People, which called for almost universal male suffrage, reform of electoral boundaries, power to rest with the Parliament which was to be elected every two years (not the King), religious freedom and an end to imprisonment for debt. Increasingly concerned at the failure to pay their wages and by political maneuverings by King Charles I of England and by some in Parliament, the army marched slowly towards London over the next few months. In late October and early November at the Putney Debates the Army debated two different proposals. The first the Agreement of the People and the other \\"The Heads of the Proposals\\", put forward by Henry Ireton, (son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell) for the Army Council. It was a constitutional manifesto which included the preservation of property rights and maintaining the privileges of the gentry. At the Putney Debates it was agreed to hold three further rendezvous. After the Putney Debates the Army commanders Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell were worried at the strength of support which the Levellers had in the Army. So they decided to impose The Heads of the Proposals as the army's manifesto instead of the Levellers' Agreement of the People To do this they demanded that every soldier sign a declaration of loyalty, to Fairfax the commander-in-chief and the Army Council, which signified that they accepted The Heads of the Proposals as the Army's manifesto. Many of the men were willing to sign, even if they had Leveller sympathies, because Cromwell and Fairfax promised that Parliament would pay them the back pay which they were owed. But if they did not sign, it was suggested, then the army could not present a united front to Parliament and payment could be delayed and that some regiments might be disbanded with no back pay at all. The declaration was a politically astute move because the soldiers were now bound to the Army Council and not the King or Parliament. At the first rendezvous was the Corkbush Field rendezvous, the senior officers in the army known as the Grandees gained the agreement of most regiments to accept the Army Council's The Heads of the Proposals instead of the Agreement of the People as the Army's manifesto. A mutiny by a minority of regiments was suppressed by Cromwell who had Private Richard Arnold, tried for mutiny and shot on the spot as an example. At the two other rendezvous at Ruislip Heath and Kingston the other regiments were ordered to show support for Fairfax which they all agreed to do. Council of Officers Over the following years the Army Council changed in constituency. The elected agitators were removed and the Council became an (Army) Council of Officers, remaining an important institution in the ruling establishment of the English Commonwealth and the Protectorate during the Interregnum. For example, at the start of the Protectorate, ten days after the dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653, Cromwell told the Council of State that it no longer existed and together with the Council of Officers, instituted a new Council of State.

Since beginning her career in 1966, Hawkins has won two Grammy Awards, two Doves, and 19 Stellar Awards. Biography =Early life and career= Hawkins was born in San Francisco, California to Roland and Lois (Cleveland) Davis. She grew up in the Ephesians Church of God in Christ located in Berkeley, California, pastored by her grandfather, the late Bishop E.E. Cleveland. While still in high school, Hawkins and her friends, Mary McCreary, Elva Mouton, and Vet Stone, had a gospel group called the Heavenly Tones that performed at various venues around the Oakland and San Francisco areas. In 1966 the group recorded the album I Love the Lord for the Gospel label, part of Savoy Records, and a 45 for the Music City label called He's Alright. When Stone's older brother Sylvester, better known as Sly Stone, formed Sly & the Family Stone with their brother Freddie and friends Larry Graham, Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini, and Greg Errico, the Heavenly Tones were recruited directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly & the Family Stone's background vocalists for their recording. Hawkins left the group to focus solely on recording and singing gospel music. At the age of 17, Hawkins sang on the Edwin Hawkins Singers Choir's single \\"Oh Happy Day\\". With her distinctive soprano and extensive vocal range, she became better known as a featured soloist with late husband Walter Hawkins' Love Center Choir as well as the Hawkins Family. Hawkins scored several hits as a solo artist in the 1980s while signed to Light Records, and released now-classic albums, such as her 1979 self-titled debut, Tramaine, and its 1983 follow-up Determined. Songs such as \\"Changed,\\" \\"Goin Up Yonder\\", \\"He's That Kind Of Friend\\", Jesus Christ Is The Way\\" and \\"Highway\\" quickly became staples and fan favorites. =Mainstream career= Hawkins was briefly a member of the 1970s R&B;/soul vocal group Honey Cone. The group recorded the R&B; hit \\"Want Ads\\" which made its way back into the gospel genre by being sampled on Mary Mary's 2005 hit \\"Heaven\\". Hawkins also briefly sang with Andrae Crouch and The Disciples, singing lead on their 1970 release \\"Christian People.\\" Hawkins is both famous and infamous for her mainstream success as a gospel artist. In the mid-1980s, she signed with A&M; Records and released a pair of dance-oriented contemporary gospel albums. Her 1985 A&M; debut The Search Is Over yielded dance chart singles such as \\"Child of the King,\\" \\"In the Morning Time,\\" and the monster club hit \\"Fall Down (Spirit of Love)\\". The latter topped the Billboard Dance Charts to A&M;'s delight. However, Hawkins was somewhat ostracized by her core gospel music audience, who were soured by her music's lyrically neutral content and the heavy mainstream attention it received. Though \\"Fall Down\\" became one of the earliest gospel songs to crossover to mainstream charts, traditional fans balked. Nonetheless, Freedom followed in 1987, producing \\"The Rock\\" and its title track as singles. The latter was co- written and produced by The Jacksons. Nearly 15 years later, \\"Fall Down\\" received a resurgence of popularity as gospel singer Kelli Williams recorded a remake of the hit as \\"Fall Down 2000\\", produced by avant garde gospel artist Ton√©x. Though the song had not been widely acknowledged in the gospel music community, the more than eight-minute extended dance mix was finally included on Hawkins's 2001 collection All My Best To You, Vol. 2. In the new millennium, Hawkins resurfaced on GospoCentric Records with a powerful release, Still Tramaine. This album included traditional gospel songs along with a duet with ex-husband, the late Walter Hawkins, on \\"It's Your Power\\". Also included on Still Tramaine was a track titled \\"Over There\\", an uptempo track reminiscent of \\"Fall Down\\". Hawkins won her first Grammy Award in 1981 for her participation performance on \\"The Lord's Prayer\\", along with her then- husband Walter Hawkins. = Return to form = Following harsh criticism and backlash from the success of her A&M; recordings, Hawkins signed with Sparrow and delivered 1988's The Joy That Floods My Soul, including the opener \\"All Things Are Possible.\\" The stellar set quickly re-endeared Hawkins to her core audience. Between album releases, Hawkins made a cameo on MC Hammer's 1990 pop-gospel hit \\"Do Not Pass Me By\\". She was also honored with a request to sing at the funeral of Sammy Davis, Jr. when the beloved entertainment legend died in May 1990. She was also a guest lead vocalist on Santana's June 1990 album \\"Spirits Dancing in the Flesh\\". Though Joy That Floods was well received, that studio effort was eclipsed by the release of the concert recording Tramaine Hawkins Live in 1990. The grandiose recording with its sweeping arrangements and show-stopping medleys of fan favorites would become a benchmark in Hawkins' career. The set eventually vindicated Hawkins in total by winning a much-coveted Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 1991. Following her triumphant comeback, she became one of the first gospel artists to sign with Columbia Records when she released To A Higher Place in 1994. Following this album's release, Hawkins took an extended hiatus from recording. New music would not surface until Hawkins' 2000 cameo appearance on gospel trio Trin-i-tee 5:7's recorded cover of her signature tune \\"Highway\\". Following this foreshadowing, Hawkins delivered the tour-de-force studio recording Still Tramaine in 2001 after signing a new contract with GospoCentric Records. The album would also give a nod to her former career as a dance-floor darling featuring Basement Boys club remixes of the single \\"By His Strength\\". Hawkins again paid final tribute to an African-American legend when she was requested in 2005 to sing at the funeral service of civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Hawkins was also part of the Rosa Parks tribute recording \\"Something Inside So Strong\\" from A Celebration of Quiet Strength, featuring other gospel artists such as Vanessa Bell Armstrong and Daryl Coley. Hawkins was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame. She received the James Cleveland Lifetime Achievement Award, and won two Stellar Awards for Female Vocalist of the Year and Traditional Female of the Year for her 2007 CD release I Never Lost My Praise (2007). After the release of her second live album, I Never Lost My Praise, Hawkins embarked on a church tour across the United States. Lady Tramaine was the special guest along with Bishop Walter Hawkins, Bishop Rance Allen, Pastor Daryl Coley, Pastor Andrae' Crouch, Dorinda Clark-Cole, Karen Clark-Sheard and Joe Ligon of the Mighty Clouds of Joy on the Mary Mary project, singing \\"It Will Be Worth It\\". She also returned to Bobby Jones Gospel in 2012 to perform \\"I Never Lost My Praise\\". In 2014, Hawkins joined fellow gospel star Donnie McClurkin on his album Duets, appearing on the track \\"My Past\\". Personal life While married to Walter Hawkins from 1971 until 1994 (23 years), the couple had two children, a son, Walter \\"Jamie\\" Hawkins and a daughter, Trystan Hawkins, with four granddaughters and three grandsons. Hawkins now refers to herself as \\"Lady Tramaine\\". She lives outside of Sacramento, California, with her husband Tommie Richardson Jr. She has one stepson, Demar(Chelesta), and two step-grandsons.

The main evidence is from altars dedicated to the god by Roman soldiers. Etymology According to J.T. Koch at the University of Wales,Koch, J.T. (2005:1300) Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia ABC-CLIO Ltd (15 Mar 2006); 978-1851094400 the various alternations of the name Moguns derive from the Romano-Celtic dialectal reflexes of Proto-Celtic *mogont-s (a derivative of the Proto-Indo-European root *megH2- \\"to be great, mighty\\"), an Indo- European *-nt- -stem cognate with Sanskrit mahƒÅnt and Avestan mazant ‚Äògreat‚Äô.Koch, J.T.

The number is the catalog number of the artifact and the name in parentheses is the word as it appears on the stone, not necessarily (and probably not) in the nominative case. Most are datives, to be translated as \\"to\\" the god: *Voreda (Old Penrith): 921 (Mogti), 922 (Mounti) *Castra Exploratorum (Netherby, Cumbria): 971 (Mogont Vitire) *Habitancum (Risingham): 1225 (Mogonito, dative of *Mogonitus, adjective formed from *Mogons), 1226 (Mouno, *Moguno, dative of *Mogunus) *Bremenium (High Rochester): 1269 (Mountibus, *Moguntibus, dative plural of *Moguns) *Vindolanda (Chesterholm): 1722d (Mogunti et Genio Loci). Modern Mainz takes its name from Castrum Moguntiacum, a Roman base placed there. It is hypothesized that Moguns gave his name to it. The inscription at Habitancum identifies the troops stationed at that location as being from the Vangiones, the Gaesati and Rhaetia; i.e., from Germania Superior. Mainz was in the territory of the Aresaces, a Celtic tribe probably part of the Treveri. The Habitancum inscription contains also the expression Deo Mogonito Cad... with the letters following Cad missing. As the region is in the territory of the historic Scottish tribe called the Gadeni, centered around Jedburgh (Jed possibly from Cad), the Cad.. is interpreted as some case of Cadeni. One speculation is that the Cadeni were a section of the Vangiones. Some derive Cadeni from Gaedhal, or Gael. A third theory derives Cad from catu-, \\"battle\\", with a sense \\"to the battle god, Mogon...\\". Considering that the gods worshipped in the future Alsace, then home of the Vangiones, were Celtic, such as Grannus, Moguns is currently taken to be Celtic. The -uns is a specifically Celtic suffix. As for the historic Gadeni, their origin is not known. They could be the remnants of the Vangiones or possibly among the indigenes. Perhaps the future discovery of additional inscriptions or the future publication of inscriptions already known but unpublished will shed further light on Mogons.

It borders the district Reutte in the north, as well as sharing a small border with Bavaria (Germany). It borders the district Innsbruck-Land in the east, South Tyrol (Italy) in the south, and the district Landeck in the west. Area of the district is , which makes it by area rank 4 of the districts of Tyrol, with a population of 57,734 (as of January 1, 2012) (Number 6 in Tyrol), and a population density of 33 persons per km¬≤. The administrative center of the district is Imst.  Geography  The district comprises a part of the upper Inn valley, with its tributary valleys √ñtztal, Pitztal, and Gurgltal, and the Mieming Plateau. The area is dominated by high alpine mountains. Mountain ranges include the Stubai Alps, √ñtztal Alps, and Mieminger Mountains. The District is around 35 km from west to east and 80 km from north to south. The Highest mountain is the Wildspitze (3.768 meters), the second highest mountain of Tyrol and the highest mountain of North Tyrol (all districts of Tyrol without the Lienz District). The Imst District is the southeast District of North Tyrol and includes one of the three passes from North to South Tyrol (Province Bolzano-Bozen, Italy), the Timmelsjoch, which is also the highest pass of Tyrol.  History  Through the Imst district there had always been an important route between Northern Italy and Germany. During the Roman empire, there was situated the most important route over the alps in Imst District: The Via Claudia Augusta. During the \\"V√∂lkerwanderung\\" in the 4th and 5th century, mostly raetoromanic people lived there. Then in the 8th century bavarians came from the north and east and divided the area in 2 areas: the lower Inn valley eastwards of the Oetztal Valley and the Gurgltal Valley around Imst. Around 780 the Area came to the Franconian Empire, even though only in the Intall Valley there were German-speaking people. In the smaller valleys the people spoke raetoromanic. Around the year 1200 there were 2 courts: Imst, which the western parts belonged to and Silz, which included the eastern parts. 1269, the court Silz came to the County of Tyrol, while Imst belonged to it since the 12th century. Since that, the whole Imst district belonged to Tyrol.

The family can be traced back to the 11th century. The most important members of this family are: * George (possibly 1390 - 1466). In 1435 he visited Sultan Murad II as an emissary of Maria Melissene, the widow of Antonio I Acciaioli, for his consent for the understanding, from himself and Maria, of his noble power in Athens. While he was away, however, their oppositions sent Maria and his family away from Athens and, when he returned, he was arrested and sent to the Sultan, who imprisoned him.

It was first opened to the public on 9 May 1992 and is located in a 1671 Dutch Warehouse above the Old Gate of Galle Fort. Whilst the building housing the museum survived the impact of the 26 December 2004 tsunami, the adjoining UNESCO Maritime Archaeology Unit was completely destroyed and all the exhibitions were flood damaged and the majority of maritime archeological artifacts were lost. Under Sri Lanka ‚Äì Netherlands Cultural Co-operation Program, the Royal Government of Netherlands provided financial assistance for reconstruction of the Maritime Museum. After 3 years period of reconstruction, the Maritime Museum was re-opened to the public.  1992-2004  The Dutch Warehouse building constructed during the latter part of the seventeenth century has, unlike in most other Dutch fortifications, a part of the building embodied into the thickness of the rampart. It is a two storey long building, and the original entry to the fort, bisects the ground floor. Above the Old Gate the British Coat of Arms is seen inscribed at the entrance, the inner part of the gate has an inscription, with the date, 1668, the letters VOC, (an abbreviation of Verenigde Oostindindische Compagnie (the Dutch East India Company)), and the insignia of a cock flanked by two lions. When the new gateway (the main or northern gate) was built by the British in 1873, piercing the main rampart between the Sun and Moon Bastions, the importance of the old gate was reduced, although it continued to be used as the main entrance to the harbour and port of Galle. During its history spanning well over three centuries, the functions of the Warehouse were many and varied. In post- independent Sri Lanka it was used as an administrative office complex until these offices were shifted to the new secretariat building outside Galle Fort. The building was subsequently reduced to a derelict building due to long years of negligence, lack of maintenance and natural decay. Portion of the building was then used to house the National Maritime Museum which was opened to the public on 9 May 1992. The National Maritime Museum originally specialised in the fauna and flora of the sea. Artifacts consisted of underwater artifacts and scaled-down models of whales and fish. The museum displayed a variety of exhibits connected with sea-faring, maritime trade, fishing and sea-life, including relics retrieved from the 20-odd maritime archaeological sites around Galle. Other exhibits included life-size dioramas of the traditional methods of fishing and the \\"walk into the sea\\" diorama, showing the natural coral beds, sea grass beds and deep sea fish. One of the final exhibits of the museum was a display of the causes of sea pollution, coast erosion, and the methods used to combat these problems.  2004 Tsunami  The museum suffered significant damage from the 2004 Asian tsunami, with only an estimated 20% of the 3,600 objects salvaged from shipwrecks within the waters of Galle port remaining. The tsunami caused the demolition of the UNESCO Archaeological Marine Unit, a joint Sri Lankan/Dutch Project, which was located on one of the old jetties just outside the northern gate of Galle Fort. The water entered the Town from the northern gate and flooded the premises of the former Maritime Museum, (up to a height of 2.2 metres), which was closed for renovations at the time of the tsunami. The Dutch warehouse building at the fort, built in 1717, was renovated and was planned to house the museum at the end of 2008.  2010 Reopening  On 4 March 2010, it was reopened as the country's first National Maritime Archaeology Museum. The original Dutch warehouse building was fully renovated under a special grant of Rs. 177 million from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The new museum has dual access, with the upper level entry linked with the present main gate, while the lower level access has reinstated the position of building as the prominent gateway. This has also made the building accessible for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Exhibits of marine artifacts found in underwater explorations are showcased in the Museum. There are maps, naval craft, ropes, earthenware, beer mugs, smoking pipes, barrels, vast numbers of articles including artillery guns and sailor shoes. Ship wrecks in the sea off the Southern coast is where these artifacts were recovered from, some of which are nearly 800 years old.

It is found in temperate areas throughout the world. Description Most giant puffballs grow to be , sometimes to be in diameter; although occasionally some can reach diameters up to and weights of . The inside of mature Giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are edible when young. The fruiting body of a puffball mushroom will develop within the period of a few weeks and soon begin to decompose and rot, at which point it is dangerous to eat. Unlike most mushrooms, all the spores of the giant puffball are created inside the fruiting body; large specimens can easily contain several trillion spores. Spores are yellowish, smooth, and 3‚Äì5 Œºm in size. The classification of this species has been revised in recent years, as the formerly recognized class Gasteromycetes, which included all puffballs, has been found to be polyphyletic. Some authors place the giant puffball and other members of genus Calvatia in order Agaricales. Also, the species has in the past been placed in two other genera, Lycoperdon and Langermannia. However, the current view is that the Giant Puffball is Calvatia. Conservation status \\"Widespread and fairly common, and not considered of conservation concern in the UK. However, it is protected in parts of Poland and considered rare in Lithuania and of conservation concern in Norway.\\" Cooking Old Giant puffball. All true puffballs are considered edible when immature, but can cause digestive upset if the spores have begun to form, as indicated by the color of the flesh being not pure white (first yellow, then brown). Immature gilled species still contained within their universal veil can be look alikes for puffballs. To distinguish puffballs from poisonous fungi, they must be cut open; edible puffballs will have a solid white interior. Some similar mushrooms have the white interior (or yellowish) but also have the silhouette of a cap-type mushroom on the interior when cut open. These are young cap-type mushrooms and may be poisonous.  Medical uses  Puffballs are a known styptic and have long been used as wound dressing, either in powdered form or as slices 3 cm thick. The fungus was often harvested prior to battles for this purpose. It is the main source of the anti-tumor mucoprotein calvacin, which is present only in tiny quantities. Similar fungi Giant puffballs resemble the earthball (Scleroderma citrinum). The latter are distinguished by a much firmer, elastic fruiting body, and having an interior that becomes dark purplish-black with white reticulation early in development. Scleroderma citrinum is poisonous and may cause mild intoxication. Images Image:VesseGeante.jpgGiant puffball.

HEDIS is one component of NCQA's accreditation process, although some plans submit HEDIS data without seeking accreditation. An incentive for many health plans to collect HEDIS data is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirement that health maintenance organizations (HMOs) submit Medicare HEDIS data in order to provide HMO services for Medicare enrollees under a program called Medicare Advantage. HEDIS was originally titled the \\"HMO Employer Data and Information Set\\" as of version 1.0 of 1991.Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way?

For example, a measure for the length of stay after giving birth was deleted after legislation mandating minimum length of stay rendered this measure nearly useless. Increased attention to medical care for seniors prompted the addition of measures related to glaucoma screening and osteoporosis treatment for older adults. Other health care concerns covered by HEDIS are immunizations, cancer screenings, treatment after heart attacks, diabetes, asthma, flu shots, access to services, dental care, alcohol and drug dependence treatment, timeliness of handling phone calls, prenatal and postpartum care, mental health care, well- care or preventive visits, inpatient utilization, drug utilization, and distribution of members by age, sex, and product lines. New measures in HEDIS 2013 are ‚ÄúAsthma Medication Ratio,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiabetes Monitoring for People With Diabetes and Schizophrenia,‚Äù ‚ÄúCardiovascular Monitoring for People With Cardiovascular Disease and Schizophrenia,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdherence to Antipsychotic Medications for Individuals With Schizophrenia.‚Äù Data collection Most HEDIS data is collected through surveys, medical charts and insurance claims for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. Survey measures must be conducted by an NCQA- approved external survey organization. Clinical measures use the administrative or hybrid data collection methodology, as specified by NCQA. Administrative data are electronic records of services, including insurance claims and registration systems from hospitals, clinics, medical offices, pharmacies and labs. For example, a measure titled Childhood Immunization Status requires health plans to identify 2-year-old children who have been enrolled for at least a year. The plans report the percentage of children who received specified immunizations. Plans may collect data for this measure by reviewing insurance claims or automated immunization records, but this method will not include immunizations received at community clinics that do not submit insurance claims. For this measure, plans are allowed to select a random sample of the population and supplement claims data with data from medical records. By doing so, plans may identify additional immunizations and report more favorable and accurate rates. However, the hybrid method is more costly, time-consuming and requires nurses or medical record reviewers who are authorized to review confidential medical records. As of 2019, NCQA is transitioning data collection to a digital process that uses existing electronic data sources rather than surveys and manual data collection. The first six measures available for HEDIS Electronic Clinical Data System (ECDS) reporting include some related to depression, unhealthy alcohol use, and immunization status. Reporting HEDIS results must be audited by an NCQA- approved auditing firm for public reporting. NCQA has an on-line reporting tool called Quality Compass that is available for a fee of several thousand dollars. It provides detailed data on all measures and is intended for employers, consultants and insurance brokers who purchase health insurance for groups. NCQA's web site includes a summary of HEDIS results by health plan. NCQA also collaborates annually with U.S. News & World Report to rank HMOs using an index that combines many HEDIS measures and accreditation status. The \\"Best Health Plans\\" list is published in the magazine in October and is available on the magazine's web site. Other local business organizations, governmental agencies and media report HEDIS results, usually when they are released in the fall.

They count only a select set of healthcare interventions, for specific at risk patient populations, that can imply that institutions and Providers are giving adequate care. Its purpose is to verify a minimally acceptable level of care is given to specific At Risk Populations. ** In 1998, HEDIS measures were said to \\"offer little insight into... [a health] plan‚Äôs ability to treat serious illnesses\\".Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way? Arch Fam Med 1998 Sep-Oct;7(5):410-3.

But, no current studies or evidence can be offered to support this and HEDIS compliance measures are updated yearly to reflect best Practices in healthcare. **A 2002 study found \\"there are numerous non-HEDIS interventions with some evidence of cost effectiveness, particularly interventions to promote healthy behaviors\\". This may speak more to the specificity of defined healthcare Best Practices interventions to At Risk Populations than to anecdotal interventions with \\"some evidence\\". Measures are revised every year to include newer and even more effective Best Practice Guidelines. ** According to a 2005 study, HEDIS-Medicaid 3.0 measures covered only 22% of the services recommended by the second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).Levine RS, Briggs NC, Husaini BA, Foster I, Hull PC, Pamies RJ, Tropez-Sims S, Emerson JS.

The organization quickly expanded to a majority membership of white Americans. At its height, NECLSA became the umbrella organization of Anti-Apartheid committees on some 100 campuses throughout the North East region of the United States.

It was developed by Beam Software and published by Ultra Games. The game was meant to be the first part in a series, but no sequels were ever made; however, it served as the basis for Beam Software's 1993 game 'Shadowrun.'Might Have Been' - Nightshade  Plot  The game takes place in a fictional urban city called Metro City. As the story unfolds, the city's local superhero named Vortex is outnumbered by gangs and killed. With the city's protector murdered, crime grows rapidly. Soon enough, the city's crime lords start fighting over control of the city, until a villain named Sutekh takes control, combining all the gangs into one. With the city completely overrun by Sutekh and the other crime lords (Rat King, Goliath, Lord Muck, and Ninja Mistress), it is soon devoured in crime. A vigilante named Mark (alias Nightshade) decides to step up and take the law into his own hands, vowing to rid Metro City of crime. Outside of the occasional violence, the game is actually somewhat light in tone (even Nightshade himself is constantly being called \\"Lampshade\\" by everybody) and rife with various popular culture references. The ending gives credit to people for the \\"bad jokes.\\"  Gameplay  The game had a unique feature; along with the action sequences and point-and-click game elements, there was a \\"popularity meter\\" that would go up or down as Nightshade performed good deeds well or poorly. Higher popularity meant greater recognition by everyday citizens of Metro City and allowed Nightshade access to more areas. The game also included fighting segments that required quick button responses. Instead of a save feature or extra lives, the villain Sutekh would throw Nightshade into a deathtrap. The first four traps each had a solution and Nightshade would escape back onto the streets of Metro City (minus some popularity points). The final one does not, and the player would have to start over from the beginning of the game. Additionally the game begins with Nightshade tied to a chair, next to which Sutekh has placed a small bomb. While technically not a deathtrap (the bomb, if not escaped on time, does not do lethal damage) this introduces the trap-escape/problem-solving element early on.  Reception  The game was received poorly for its complicated, yet not adjustable controls.

In computer science, it is common for multiple threads to simultaneously access the same resources. Data corruption can occur if two or more threads try to write into the same memory location, or if one thread reads a memory location before another has finished writing into it. Lamport's bakery algorithm is one of many mutual exclusion algorithms designed to prevent concurrent threads entering critical sections of code concurrently to eliminate the risk of data corruption.  Algorithm  = Analogy = Lamport envisioned a bakery with a numbering machine at its entrance so each customer is given a unique number. Numbers increase by one as customers enter the store. A global counter displays the number of the customer that is currently being served. All other customers must wait in a queue until the baker finishes serving the current customer and the next number is displayed. When the customer is done shopping and has disposed of his or her number, the clerk increments the number, allowing the next customer to be served. That customer must draw another number from the numbering machine in order to shop again. According to the analogy, the \\"customers\\" are threads, identified by the letter i, obtained from a global variable. Due to the limitations of computer architecture, some parts of Lamport's analogy need slight modification. It is possible that more than one thread will get the same number n when they request it; this cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is assumed that the thread identifier i is also a priority. A lower value of i means a higher priority and threads with higher priority will enter the critical section first. = Critical section = The critical section is that part of code that requires exclusive access to resources and may only be executed by one thread at a time. In the bakery analogy, it is when the customer trades with the baker that others must wait. When a thread wants to enter the critical section, it has to check whether now is its turn to do so. It should check the number n of every other thread to make sure that it has the smallest one. In case another thread has the same number, the thread with the smallest i will enter the critical section first. In pseudocode this comparison between threads a and b can be written in the form: (na, ia) < (nb, ib) // ia \\\\- the customer number for thread a, na \\\\- the thread number for thread a which is equivalent to: (ia < ib) or ((ia  ib) and (na < nb)) Once the thread ends its critical job, it gets rid of its number and enters the non-critical section. = Non-critical section = The non-critical section is the part of code that doesn't need exclusive access. It represents some thread-specific computation that doesn't interfere with other threads' resources and execution. This part is analogous to actions that occur after shopping, such as putting change back into the wallet.  Implementation of the algorithm  = Definitions = In Lamport's original paper, the entering variable is known as choosing, and the following conditions apply: * Words choosing [i] and number [i] are in the memory of process i, and are initially zero. * The range of values of number [i] is unbounded. * A process may fail at any time. We assume that when it fails, it immediately goes to its noncritical section and halts. There may then be a period when reading from its memory gives arbitrary values. Eventually, any read from its memory must give a value of zero. = Code examples =  Pseudocode  In this example, all threads execute the same \\"main\\" function, Thread. In real applications, different threads often have different \\"main\\" functions. Note that as in the original paper, the thread checks itself before entering the critical section. Since the loop conditions will evaluate as false, this does not cause much delay. // declaration and initial values of global variables Entering: array [1..NUM_THREADS] of bool = {false}; Number: array [1..NUM_THREADS] of integer = {0}; lock(integer i) { Entering[i] = true; Number[i] = 1 + max(Number[1], ..., Number[NUM_THREADS]); Entering[i] = false; for (integer j = 1; j <= NUM_THREADS; j++) { // Wait until thread j receives its number: while (Entering[j]) { /* nothing */ } // Wait until all threads with smaller numbers or with the same // number, but with higher priority, finish their work: while ((Number[j] != 0) && ((Number[j], j) < (Number[i], i))) { /* nothing */ } } } unlock(integer i) { Number[i] = 0; } Thread(integer i) { while (true) { lock(i); // The critical section goes here... unlock(i); // non-critical section... } }  PlusCal code  We declare N to be the number of processes, and we assume that N is a natural number.

Under the Java Memory Model this ensures that writes are immediately visible to all threads. AtomicIntegerArray ticket = new AtomicIntegerArray(threads); // ticket for threads in line, n - number of threads // Java initializes each element of 'ticket' to 0 AtomicIntegerArray entering = new AtomicIntegerArray(threads); // 1 when thread entering in line // Java initializes each element of 'entering' to 0 public void lock(int pid) // thread ID { entering.set(pid, 1); int max = 0; for (int i = 0; i < threads; i++) { int current = ticket.get(i); if (current > max) { max = current; } } ticket.set(pid, 1 + max); entering.set(pid, 0); for (int i = 0; i < ticket.length(); ++i) { if (i != pid) { while (entering.get(i)  1) { Thread.yield(); } // wait while other thread picks a ticket while (ticket.get(i) != 0 && ( ticket.get(pid) > ticket.get(i)  (ticket.get(pid)  ticket.get(i) && pid > i))) { Thread.yield(); } } } // The critical section goes here... } public void unlock(int pid) { ticket.set(pid, 0); } = Discussion = Each thread only writes its own storage, only reads are shared. It is remarkable that this algorithm is not built on top of some lower level \\"atomic\\" operation, e.g. compare-and-swap. The original proof shows that for overlapping reads and writes to the same storage cell only the write must be correct. The read operation can return an arbitrary number. Therefore this algorithm can be used to implement mutual exclusion on memory that lacks synchronisation primitives, e.g., a simple SCSI disk shared between two computers. The necessity of the variable Entering might not be obvious as there is no 'lock' around lines 7 to 13. However, suppose the variable was removed and two processes computed the same \`Number[i]\`. If the higher-priority process was preempted before setting \`Number[i]\`, the low-priority process will see that the other process has a number of zero, and enters the critical section; later, the high-priority process will ignore equal \`Number[i]\` for lower-priority processes, and also enters the critical section. As a result, two processes can enter the critical section at the same time. The bakery algorithm uses the Entering variable to make the assignment on line 6 look like it was atomic; process i will never see a number equal to zero for a process j that is going to pick the same number as i. When implementing the pseudo code in a single process system or under cooperative multitasking, it is better to replace the \\"do nothing\\" sections with code that notifies the operating system to immediately switch to the next thread. This primitive is often referred to as \`yield\`. Lamport's bakery algorithm assumes a sequential consistency memory model. Few, if any, languages or multi-core processors implement such a memory model. Therefore correct implementation of the algorithm typically requires inserting fences to inhibit reordering.Chinmay Narayan, Shibashis Guha, S.Arun-Kumar Inferring Fences in a Concurrent Program Using SC proof of Correctness  See also  * Dekker's algorithm * Eisenberg & McGuire algorithm * Peterson's algorithm * Szyma≈Ñski's algorithm * Semaphores  References  * Original Paper * On his publications page, Lamport has added some remarks regarding the algorithm.

The building The two storey colonnaded building on Prince Street, Pettah (Colombo 11) which houses this museum was constructed during the Dutch occupation of Colombo (1656 - 1796) and was the formal residence of the Governor of Dutch Ceylon Thomas van Rhee (1634 - 1701) during his term of office in 1692 to 1697. The building has been used for many different purposes over the years. It was a teacher training college and an institute for the instruction of clergymen between 1696 and 1796. At one time it was the residence of Colonel Count August Carl Fredrick Von Ranzow (1759 - 1844). It operated as an orphanage under the supervision of the deacons and financed by the Dutch East Indies Company. It was also used as a hospital. It became a barracks in the second half of the 1800s and in 1900 it was used as a police training school, set up by the British. In 1932 it was converted to the Pettah Post Office. In 1971 following heavy monsoon rains one of the exterior walls collapsed and the building was abandoned. Following protests by the Royal Asiatic Society and the Dutch Burgher Union against plans to demolish the building, in 1973 a committee was established with representatives from the Ceylon Tourist Board, the Department of Archaeology, the Netherlands Alumni Association of Lanka and the National Archives, to restore the building and establish a museum covering the Dutch colonial period. The restoration of the building commenced in 1977, with financial assistance of Netherlands government, and was completed in 1981. This museum was opened to the public in 1982. This building embodies the unique architectural features of a colonial Dutch town house. In 1999 the museum building was formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological protected monument in Sri Lanka. The designation was declared on 18 June under the government Gazette number 1085.

Gaseous ionization detectors are radiation detection instruments used in particle physics to detect the presence of ionizing particles, and in radiation protection applications to measure ionizing radiation. They use the ionising effect of radiation upon a gas-filled sensor. If a particle has enough energy to ionize a gas atom or molecule, the resulting electrons and ions cause a current flow which can be measured. Gaseous ionisation detectors form an important group of instruments used for radiation detection and measurement. This article gives a quick overview of the principal types, and more detailed information can be found in the articles on each instrument. The accompanying plot shows the variation of ion pair generation with varying applied voltage for constant incident radiation. There are three main practical operating regions, one of which each type utilises. Types Families of ionising radiation detectors The three basic types of gaseous ionization detectors are 1) ionization chambers, 2) proportional counters, and 3) Geiger-M√ºller tubes All of these have the same basic design of two electrodes separated by air or a special fill gas, but each uses a different method to measure the total number of ion-pairs that are collected.McGregor, Douglas S. \\"Chapter 8 - Detection and Measurement of Radiation.\\" Fundamentals of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Second Edition. By J. Kenneth Shultis and Richard E. Faw. 2nd ed. CRC, 2007. 202-222. Print. The strength of the electric field between the electrodes and the type and pressure of the fill gas determines the detector's response to ionizing radiation. =Ionization chamber= Schematic diagram of ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons typically drift 1000 times faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass. Ionization chambers operate at a low electric field strength, selected such that no gas multiplication takes place. The ion current is generated by the creation of \\"ion pairs\\", consisting of an ion and an electron. The ions drift to the cathode while free electrons drift to the anode under the influence of the electric field. This current is independent of the applied voltage if the device is being operated in the \\"ion chamber region\\". Ion chambers are preferred for high radiation dose rates because they have no \\"dead time\\"; a phenomenon which affects the accuracy of the Geiger Muller tube at high dose rates. The advantages are good uniform response to gamma radiation and accurate overall dose reading, capable of measuring very high radiation rates, sustained high radiation levels do not degrade the fill gas. The disadvantages are 1) low output requiring sophisticated electrometer circuit and 2) operation and accuracy easily affected by moisture. =Proportional counter= The generation of discrete Townsend avalanches in a proportional counter. Proportional counters operate at a slightly higher voltage, selected such that discrete avalanches are generated. Each ion pair produces a single avalanche so that an output current pulse is generated which is proportional to the energy deposited by the radiation. This is in the \\"proportional counting\\" region.Glenn F Knoll, Radiation detection and measurement, John Wiley and son, 2000. The term \\"gas proportional detector\\" (GPD) is generally used in radiometric practice, and the property of being able to detect particle energy is particularly useful when using large area flat arrays for alpha and beta particle detection and discrimination, such as in installed personnel monitoring equipment. The wire chamber is a multi- electrode form of proportional counter used as a research tool. The advantages are the ability to measure energy of radiation and provide spectrographic information, discriminate between alpha and beta particles, and that large area detectors can be constructed The disadvantages are that anode wires are delicate and can lose efficiency in gas flow detectors due to deposition, the efficiency and operation affected by ingress of oxygen into fill gas, and measurement windows easily damaged in large area detectors. Micropattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are high granularity gaseous detectors with sub- millimeter distances between the anode and cathode electrodes. The main advantages of these microelectronic structures over traditional wire chambers include: count rate capability, time and position resolution, granularity, stability and radiation hardness . Examples of MPGDs are the microstrip gas chamber, the gas electron multiplier and the micromegas detector. =Geiger- M√ºller tube= Visualisation of the spread of Townsend avalanches by means of UV photons Geiger-M√ºller tubes are the primary components of Geiger counters. They operate at an even higher voltage, selected such that each ion pair creates an avalanche, but by the emission of UV photons, multiple avalanches are created which spread along the anode wire, and the adjacent gas volume ionizes from as little as a single ion pair event. This is the \\"Geiger region\\" of operation. The current pulses produced by the ionising events are passed to processing electronics which can derive a visual display of count rate or radiation dose, and usually in the case of hand-held instruments, an audio device producing clicks. The advantages are that they are a cheap and robust detector with a large variety of sizes and applications, large output signal is produced from tube which requires minimal electronic processing for simple counting, and it can measure the overall gamma dose when using an energy compensated tube. The disadvantages are that it cannot measure the energy of the radiation (no spectrographic information), it will not measure high radiation rates due to dead time, and sustained high radiation levels will degrade fill gas. Guidance on detector type usage The UK Health and Safety Executive has issued a guidance note on the correct portable instrument for the application concerned.http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/irp7.pdf This covers all radiation instrument technologies and is useful in selecting the correct gaseous ionisation detector technology for a measurement application. Everyday use Ionization-type smoke detectors are gaseous ionization detectors in widespread use. A small source of radioactive americium is placed so that it maintains a current between two plates that effectively form an ionisation chamber. If smoke gets between the plates where ionization is taking place, the ionized gas can be neutralized leading to a reduced current. The decrease in current triggers a fire alarm.

The battle is named after the mountain Aspromonte in southern Italy, which is near the place where the battle occurred. In the battle, the Royal Italian Army defeated Giuseppe Garibaldi's army of volunteers, who were marching from Sicily towards Rome, with the intent of annexing it into the Kingdom of Italy. In the battle, which took place a few kilometers from Gambarie, Garibaldi was wounded and taken prisoner. Background When Victor Emmanuel II became the King of Italy on 17 March 1861, the newly created Kingdom of Italy did not include Venice and Rome. These \\"unredeemed\\" cities, as they would be called a few decades later, were a constant cause of friction in Italian politics. The dispute concerning Rome, specifically known as the \\"Roman Question\\", had arisen after the Italian Parliament had declared Rome capital of the Kingdom on 27 March 1861. This conflicted with Pope Pius IX's intent to maintain his temporal control of the city. Members of the government of the Kingdom of Italy had different perspectives on this issue, and the internal tensions that followed caused Prime Minister Bettino Ricasoli to resign in 1862. While his successor, Urbano Rattazzi, was known for his disrespectful attitude towards the Holy See, the Kingdom of Italy maintained a low profile on the Roman Question after Rattazzi's election. Meanwhile, General Giuseppe Garibaldi reached Sicily and began to form an army, with the intent of marching on Rome. The intransigent reaction of France (which was, at the time, the most influential ally of Italy) and the Pope caused the Italian government to intervene. On 3 August, Victor Emmanuel II officially condemned Garibaldi's \\"guilty impatience\\", and Rattazzi sent the Royal Army, at the orders of general Enrico Cialdini, to stop Garibaldi. The battle Garibaldi wounded on the Aspromonte (by Gerolamo Induno) Garibaldi was known and respected as a hero by most Italians, including most soldiers in the Royal Army and Navy. Several actions that occurred reveal that neither Garibaldi nor his opponents were willing to enter open combat, or cause too much damage to their opponent. Although Garibaldi's ships had likely been detected by the Royal Navy while they were crossing the Strait of Messina to reach land in Calabria, the Royal Army only attacked when Garibaldi's army had actually reached land, possibly to keep losses to a minimum. Garibaldi himself did not immediately counter-attack the Royal Army, instead trying to circumvent it by crossing the Aspromonte mountains. Garibaldi's army marched for three days; on 28 August 1862, the leading regiment, led by Garibaldi, camped near Gambarie, where the rest of his army was expected to arrive in a few days. On 29 August, before Garibaldi's army was reunited, Bersaglieri from the Royal Army reached Garibaldi's camp and attacked. Garibaldi ordered his army not to open fire \\"on our brothers\\", and some Bersaglieri changed sides during the battle, joining Garibaldi's volunteers. However, despite Garibaldi's order, one wing of his regiment mounted a counter-attack against the Bersaglieri. During the altercation, two bullets hit Garibaldi's hip and malleolus. A cease-fire was declared shortly thereafter, and Garibaldi surrendered. Aftermath The battle lasted for about ten minutes and resulted in around 15 casualties. Garibaldi, now wounded, was immediately assisted by surgeons and taken prisoner; he was later sent to the jail at Varignano, near Porto Venere. Garibaldi and his volunteers received amnesty on 5 October 1862; Garibaldi officially retired to Caprera, where he remained for two years. The Day of Aspromonte caused both national and international criticism towards the Italian government, and caused the debate in Italy to become even harsher. Giuseppe Mazzini's party declared that, after the events of Aspromonte, any silent agreement between the Monarchy and the Republicans had been factually broken; supporters of the Monarchy maintained that the Republicans' support for such rash initiatives as Garibaldi's expedition proved that they were too irresponsible to lead the nation. Commentators accused the government of betraying the Italian revolution and being more supportive of the Pope than of Italy itself. In 1863, Rattazzi was replaced by Marco Minghetti, who leveraged on the facts of Aspromonte to negotiate a treaty with France (the September Convention), in which Italy would protect the frontiers of the Papal States against foreign attacks, and France would withdraw its troops from Rome within two years. Despite the September Convention, annexing Rome remained an implicit objective of Italy. Garibaldi tried to march on Rome again in 1867. Eventually, the Questione Romana was solved under Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Lanza, when Rome was finally captured in 1870. In popular culture A popular Italian nursery rhyme, Garibaldi fu ferito (\\"Garibaldi was wounded\\"), set to the melody of Bersaglieri's anthem, refers to the Battle of Aspromonte. The battle is also sometimes mentioned in political debate, when someone accuses the Italian government of betraying the expectations of the Italian people, or acting against national interests.

The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne, had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the British press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced the handling of the case by the authoritiesAronson, p. 177 and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since. The police acquired testimonies that Lord Arthur Somerset, an equerry to the Prince of Wales, was a patron.Lees-Milne, James (1986). The Enigmatic Edwardian. Sidgwick and Jackson. p. 82 Both he and the brothel keeper, Charles Hammond, managed to flee abroad before a prosecution could be brought. The male prostitutes, who also worked as telegraph messenger boys for the Post Office, were given light sentences and no clients were prosecuted. After Henry James FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, was named in the press as a client, he successfully sued for libel. The scandal fuelled the attitude that male homosexuality was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde of being an active homosexual.  Male brothel  Illustration of Inspector alt=Head of a whiskered man in profile In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was investigating a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered to be in possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash in the course of their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.Aronson, pp. 8‚Äì10 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 20‚Äì23 Constable Hanks reported the matter to his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town.Aronson, pp. 11, 16‚Äì17 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 23‚Äì24 In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 23  Notable clients  alt=Cartoon of a ginger-haired paunchy gentleman in tweeds On the way to the police station, Newlove named Lord Arthur Somerset and Henry FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, as well as an army colonel by the name of Jervois, as visitors to Cleveland Street.Aronson, p. 11 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 25 Somerset was the head of the Prince of Wales's stables. Although Somerset was interviewed by police, no immediate action was taken against him, and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset's involvement.Aronson, p. 135 A watch was placed on the now-empty house and details of the case shuffled between government departments.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 26‚Äì33 On 19 August, an arrest warrant was issued in the name of George Veck, an acquaintance of Hammond's who pretended to be a clergyman. Veck had actually worked at the Telegraph Office, but had been sacked for \\"improper conduct\\" with the messenger boys.Aronson, pp. 11, 133 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 25 A seventeen-year-old youth found in Veck's London lodgings revealed to the police that Veck had gone to Portsmouth and was returning shortly by train. The police arrested Veck at London Waterloo railway station. In his pockets they discovered letters from Algernon Allies. Abberline sent Constable Hanks to interview Allies at his parents' home in Sudbury, Suffolk. Allies admitted to receiving money from Somerset, having a sexual relationship with him, and working at Cleveland Street for Hammond.Aronson, pp. 134‚Äì135 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 34‚Äì35 On 22 August, police interviewed Somerset for a second time, after which Somerset left for Bad Homburg,Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 35 where the Prince of Wales was taking his summer holiday.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 38 On 11 September, Newlove and Veck were committed for trial. Their defence was handled by Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, with Willie Mathews appearing for Newlove, and Charles Gill for Veck. Somerset paid the legal fees.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 35, 45, 47 By this time, Somerset had moved on to Hanover, to inspect some horses for the Prince of Wales, and the press was referring to \\"noble lords\\" implicated in the trial.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 42, 46 Newlove and Veck pleaded guilty to indecency on 18 September and the judge, Sir Thomas Chambers, a former Liberal Member of Parliament who had a reputation for leniency, sentenced them to four and nine months' hard labour respectively.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 47‚Äì53 The boys were also given sentences that were considered at the time to be very lenient.Aronson, p. 137 Hammond escaped to France, but the French authorities expelled him after pressure from the British. Hammond moved on to Belgium from where he emigrated to the United States. Newton, acting for Somerset, paid for Hammond's passage.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 74‚Äì77 On the advice of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, no extradition proceedings were attempted, and the case against Hammond was quietly dropped.Aronson, p. 136 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 27, 34 Somerset returned to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at Newmarket but suddenly left for Dieppe on 26 September, probably after being told by Newton that he was in danger of being arrested.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 61 He returned again on 30 September. A few days later, his grandmother, Emily Somerset, Dowager Duchess of Beaufort, died and he attended her funeral.Aronson, p. 140 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 80‚Äì81 The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe, Assistant Treasury Solicitor, and James Monro, Commissioner of Police, pressed for action to be taken against Somerset, but the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, blocked any prosecution.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 82‚Äì86 Rumours of Somerset's involvement were circulating, and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France. Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir Dighton Probyn, who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before, that a warrant for his arrest was imminent.Aronson, p. 142 This was denied by Lord SalisburyHyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 93 and the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 94 Probyn's informant may have been the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Richard Pearson.Ridley, Jane (2013).

On 12 November, a warrant for Somerset's arrest was finally issued.Aronson, p. 144 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 98‚Äì99 By this time, Somerset was already safely abroad, and the warrant caught little public attention.Aronson, p. 150 After an unsuccessful search for employment in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, Somerset lived the rest of his life in self-imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France.Aronson, p. 175 Other names mentioned by the press were Lord Ronald Gower and Lord Errol.\\"The London Scandals\\", The Press (New Zealand), Volume XLVI, Issue 7418, 9 December 1889, Page 6 Also implicated was the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley,\\"The West End Scandal: Another Flight\\", Evening News (Sydney, Australia), Tuesday 14 January 1890\\"Another London Society Leader Gone\\", The Salt Lake Herald, Wednesday 1 January 1890 who fled abroad for four years.\\"La Marquise de Fontenoy\\" (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen), Chicago Tribune, 8 May 1916\\"Vanity Fair\\" by J.M.D., The Australasian (Melbourne), 22 September 1894 The Paris Figaro even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house.\\"Boulanger Mixed Up in a Scandal\\", Chicago Tribune, 2 February 1890, p. 4 The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters.\\"Brevities by Cable\\", Chicago Tribune, 1 August 1890 In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being \\"daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character\\" bearing upon the scandal.\\"Notes on Current Topics\\", The Cardiff Times 7 December 1889, p. 5 By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified, twenty-two of whom had fled the country.\\"The Cleveland Street Scandal\\", The Press (Canterbury, New Zealand), Volume XLVII, Issue 74518, 6 February 1890, Page 6  Public revelations  alt=Newspaper clipping Because the press initially barely covered the story, the affair would have faded quickly from public memory if not for journalist Ernest Parke. The editor of the obscure politically radical weekly The North London Press, Parke got wind of the affair when one of his reporters brought him the story of Newlove's conviction. Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence (the usual penalty for \\"gross indecency\\" was two years) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest. His curiosity aroused, Parke found out that the boys had named prominent aristocrats. He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 106‚Äì107 It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, in \\"an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street\\".North London Press, 16 November 1889, quoted in Hyde, The Other Love, p. 125 He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person,Aronson, p. 150 and Hyde, The Other Love, p. 125 who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor, the son of the Prince of Wales.Hyde, The Other Love, p. 123 Euston was in fact still in England and immediately filed a case against Parke for libel. At the trial, Euston admitted that when walking along Piccadilly a tout had given him a card which read \\"Poses plastiques. C. Hammond, 19 Cleveland Street\\". Euston testified that he went to the house believing Poses plastiques meant a display of female nudes. He paid a sovereign to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the \\"improper\\" nature of the place and immediately left. The defence witnesses contradicted each other, and could not describe Euston accurately.Aronson, pp. 151‚Äì159 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 113‚Äì116, 139‚Äì143 The final defence witness, John Saul, was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle, and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel The Sins of the Cities of the Plain which was cast as his autobiography.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 108 Delivering his testimony in a manner described as \\"brazen effrontery\\", Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an \\"immoral life\\" and \\"practising criminality\\", and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house.Saul quoted in Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 146‚Äì147 The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses, and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country. On 16 January 1890, the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison.Aronson, pp. 151‚Äì159 and Hyde, The Other Love, pp. 125‚Äì127 One historian considers Euston was telling the truth and only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card.Hyde, The Other Love, p. 127 However, another has alleged Euston was a well-known figure in the homosexual underworld, and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn, that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the Victoria Cross for his tenacity.Aronson, p. 160 Saul stated that he told the police his story in August, which provoked the judge to enquire rhetorically why the authorities had not taken action.\\"Lord Euston's Libel Case\\", South Australian Register, 18 February 1890, p. 5 The judge, Sir Henry Hawkins, had a distinguished career, although after his death a former Solicitor General for England and Wales, Sir Edward Clarke, wrote: \\"Sir Henry Hawkins was the worst judge I ever knew or heard of. He had no notion whatever of what justice meant, or of the obligations of truth or fairness.\\"\\"The Worst Judge I Ever Knew\\", The Argus (Melbourne), 15 May 1915 The prosecuting counsels, Charles Russell and Willie Mathews, went on to become Lord Chief Justice and Director of Public Prosecutions, respectively. The defence counsel, Frank Lockwood, later became Solicitor General, and he was assisted by H. H. Asquith, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twenty years later.Aronson, p. 153 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 135 While Parke's conviction cleared Euston, another trial began on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, was charged with obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty to one of the six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 162‚Äì207 On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison,Aronson, p. 173 which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 208‚Äì212 alt=Head and shoulders of a bearded middle-aged gentleman During Newton's trial, a motion in Parliament sought to investigate Parke's allegations of a cover-up. Henry Labouch√®re, a Member of Parliament from the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, was staunchly against homosexuality and had campaigned successfully to add the \\"gross indecency\\" amendment (known as the \\"Labouch√®re Amendment\\") to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. He was convinced that the conspiracy to cover up the scandal went further up the government than assumed. Labouch√®re made his suspicions known in Parliament on 28 February 1890. He denied that \\"a gentleman of very high position\\"‚Äîpresumably Prince Albert Victor‚Äîwas in any way involved with the scandal, but accused the government of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He suggested that the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and other officials colluded to hamper the investigation,Mr Labouchere's Suspension, Northampton Mercury 8 March 1890, p5 allowing Somerset and Hammond to escape, delaying the trials and failing to prosecute the case with vigour. Labouch√®re's accusations were rebutted by the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster, who was also the prosecutor in the Newton case. Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Parke and was defending Newton, sat on the Liberal benches with Labouch√®re but refused to be drawn into the debate. After an often passionate debate over seven hours, during which Labouch√®re was expelled from Parliament after saying \\"I do not believe Lord Salisbury\\" and refusing to withdraw his remark, the motion was defeated by a wide margin, 206‚Äì66.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 215‚Äì231 In a subsequent speech to the House of Lords, Salisbury bore witness against himself by suggesting his memory of his handling of the affair was defective.  Aftermath  Public interest in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited by members of the upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas. Oscar Wilde may have alluded to the scandal in The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890.In chapter 12 of the original 1890 version, one of the characters, Basil Hallward, refers to \\"Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England, with a tarnished name\\".

He was prosecuted by Charles Gill, who had defended Veck in the Cleveland Street case.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 45 Prince Albert Victor of Wales was created Duke of Clarence and Avondale the year after the scandal.alt=Smartly=dressed young man with a moustache Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society gossip about his sex life continued. Sixty years after the scandal the official biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy at the time of the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor \\"had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated.\\"Lees-Milne, p. 231 In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients‚Äîthe notorious murderer Harvey Crippen.Cook, pp. 284‚Äì285 In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences.Cook, pp. 285‚Äì286 and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 253 Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover- up.Prince Eddy: The King We Never Had. Channel 4. Accessed 1 May 2010. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him.Cook, pp. 172‚Äì173 Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, \\"I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it‚Äîbut in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true.\\"Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 55 Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, \\"I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing ... we were both accused of going to this place but not together ... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention.\\"Lord Arthur Somerset to Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, 10 December 1889, quoted in Cook, p. 197 In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to \\"cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV\\" and \\"false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story\\".Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 127 When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying \\"there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor.\\"Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 129 Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual,Aronson, pp. 116‚Äì120, 170, 217 but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as \\"ardently heterosexual\\" and his involvement in the rumours as \\"somewhat unfair\\".Bradford, p. 10 In 1902 an American newspaper alleged that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned in some way that 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance and that he may have been identified as a visitor, contrived to bring the prince to the house on an innocent pretext in the hope that the police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the prince's fondness for boulle furniture: he invited him to inspect a boulle cabinet which was in the house, and the prince remained there for no more than five minutes.\\"Assails King's Dead Son\\", Chicago Tribune, 12 September 1902  House  The site of the brothel at 19 Cleveland Street, Marylebone, and its historical context within the homosexual and other transgressive communities of London's Fitzrovia and neighbouring Soho and Bloomsbury, has become the subject of academic study and general interest.Houlbrook, Paul (2006).

Numerical methods using interval arithmetic can guarantee reliable, mathematically correct results. Instead of representing a value as a single number, interval arithmetic represents each value as a range of possibilities. For example, instead of estimating the height of someone as exactly 2.0 metres, using interval arithmetic one might be certain that that person is somewhere between 1.97 and 2.03 metres. Mathematically, instead of working with an uncertain real x, one works with the ends of an interval [a,b] that contains x. In interval arithmetic, any variable x lies in the closed interval between a and b. A function f, when applied to x, yields an uncertain result; f produces an interval [c,d] which includes all the possible values for f(x) for all x \\\\in [a,b]. Interval arithmetic is suitable for a variety of purposes. The most common use is in software, to keep track of rounding errors in calculations and of uncertainties in the knowledge of the exact values of physical and technical parameters. The latter often arise from measurement errors and tolerances for components or due to limits on computational accuracy. Interval arithmetic also helps find guaranteed solutions to equations (such as differential equations) and optimization problems. Introduction The main objective of interval arithmetic is a simple way to calculate upper and lower bounds for the range of a function in one or more variables. These endpoints are not necessarily the true supremum or infimum, since the precise calculation of those values can be difficult or impossible; the bounds need only contain the function's range as a subset. This treatment is typically limited to real intervals, so quantities of form :[a,b] = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\,\\\\, a \\\\le x \\\\le b\\\\\\\\}, where a = {-\\\\infty} and b = {\\\\infty} are allowed. With one of a, b infinite, the interval would be an unbounded interval; with both infinite, the interval would be the extended real number line. Since a real number r can be interpreted as the interval [r,r], intervals and real numbers can be freely combined. As with traditional calculations with real numbers, simple arithmetic operations and functions on elementary intervals must first be defined. More complicated functions can be calculated from these basic elements. =Example= Body mass index for a person 1.80 m tall in relation to body weight m (in kilograms) As an example, consider the calculation of body mass index (BMI) and assessing whether a person is overweight. BMI is calculated as a person's body weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in metres. A bathroom scale may have a resolution of one kilogram. Intermediate values cannot be discerned‚Äî79.6 kg and 80.3 kg are indistinguishable, for example‚Äîbut the true weight is rounded to the nearest whole number. It is unlikely that when the scale reads 80 kg, the person weighs exactly 80.0 kg. In normal rounding to the nearest value, the scale's showing 80 kg indicates a weight between 79.5 kg and 80.5 kg. This corresponds with the interval [79.5, 80.5]. For a man who weighs 80 kg and is 1.80 m tall, the BMI is approximately 24.7. A weight of 79.5 kg and the same height yields approx. 24.537, while a weight of 80.5 kg yields approx. 24.846. Since the function is monotonically increasing, we conclude that the true BMI is in the range [24.537, 24.846]. Since the entire range is less than 25, which is the cutoff between normal and excessive weight, we conclude that the man is of normal weight. The error in this case does not affect the conclusion (normal weight), but this is not always the case. If the man was slightly heavier, the BMI's range may include the cutoff value of 25. In that case, the scale's precision was insufficient to make a definitive conclusion. Also, note that the range of BMI examples could be reported as [24.5, 24.9], since this interval is a subset of the calculated interval. The range could not, however, be reported as [24.6, 24.8], as now the interval does not contain possible BMI values. Interval arithmetic states the range of possible outcomes explicitly. Results are no longer stated as numbers, but as intervals that represent imprecise values. The size of the intervals are similar to error bars in expressing the extent of uncertainty.  Multiple intervals  Body mass index for different weights in relation to height L (in metres) Height and body weight both affect the value of the BMI. We have already treated weight as an uncertain measurement, but height is also subject to uncertainty. Height measurements in metres are usually rounded to the nearest centimeter: a recorded measurement of 1.79 metres actually means a height in the interval [1.785, 1.795]. Now, all four combinations of possible height/weight values must be considered. Using the interval methods described below, the BMI lies in the interval :\\\\frac{[79.5, 80.5]}{[1.785, 1.795]^2} \\\\subseteq [24.673, 25.266]. In this case, the man may have a normal weight or be overweight; the weight and height measurements were insufficiently precise to make a definitive conclusion. This demonstrates interval arithmetic's ability to correctly track and propagate error.  Interval operators  An binary operation \\\\star on two intervals, such as addition or multiplication, is defined by :[x_1, x_2] {\\\\,\\\\star\\\\,} [y_1, y_2] = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\star y \\\\,  \\\\, x \\\\in [x_1, x_2] \\\\,\\\\land\\\\, y \\\\in [y_1, y_2] \\\\\\\\}. In other words, it is the set of all possible values of x \\\\star y, where x and y are in their corresponding intervals. If \\\\star is monotone in each operand on the intervals, which is the case for the four basic arithmetic operations (except division when the denominator contains 0), the extreme values occur at the endpoints of the operand intervals. Writing out all combinations, one way of stating this is :[x_1, x_2] \\\\star [y_1, y_2] = \\\\left[ \\\\min\\\\\\\\{ x_1 \\\\star y_1, x_1 \\\\star y_2, x_2 \\\\star y_1, x_2 \\\\star y_2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\max \\\\\\\\{x_1 \\\\star y_1, x_1 \\\\star y_2, x_2 \\\\star y_1, x_2 \\\\star y_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\right], provided that x \\\\star y is defined for all x\\\\in [x_1, x_2] and y \\\\in [y_1, y_2]. For practical applications this can be simplified further: * Addition: [x_1, x_2] + [y_1, y_2] = [x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2] * Subtraction: [x_1, x_2] - [y_1, y_2] = [x_1-y_2, x_2-y_1] * Multiplication: [x_1, x_2] \\\\cdot [y_1, y_2] = [\\\\min \\\\\\\\{x_1 y_1,x_1 y_2,x_2 y_1,x_2 y_2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\max\\\\\\\\{x_1 y_1,x_1 y_2,x_2 y_1,x_2 y_2\\\\\\\\}] * Division: ::\\\\frac{[x_1, x_2]}{[y_1, y_2]} = [x_1, x_2] \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]}, :where ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]} &= \\\\left [\\\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\\\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\\\right ] && \\\\mathrm{if}\\\\;0 otin [y_1, y_2] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{[y_1, 0]} &= \\\\left [-\\\\infty, \\\\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\\\right ] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{[0, y_2]} &= \\\\left [\\\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\\\infty \\\\right ] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]} &= \\\\left [-\\\\infty, \\\\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\\\right ] \\\\cup \\\\left [\\\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\\\infty \\\\right ] \\\\subseteq [-\\\\infty, \\\\infty] && \\\\mathrm{if}\\\\;0 \\\\in (y_1, y_2) \\\\end{align} The last case loses useful information about the exclusion of (1/y_1, 1/y_2). Thus, it is common to work with \\\\left [-\\\\infty, \\\\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\\\right ] and \\\\left [\\\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\\\infty \\\\right ] as separate intervals. More generally, when working with discontinuous functions, it is sometimes useful to do the calculation with so-called multi-intervals of the form \\\\bigcup_{i} \\\\left [a_i, b_i \\\\right ]. The corresponding multi-interval arithmetic maintains a set of (usually disjoint) intervals and also provides for overlapping intervals to unite. Multiplication of positive intervals Interval multiplication often only requires two multiplications. If x_1, y_1 are nonnegative, :[x_1, x_2] \\\\cdot [y_1, y_2] = [x_1 \\\\cdot y_1, x_2 \\\\cdot y_2], \\\\qquad \\\\text{ if } x_1, y_1 \\\\geq 0. The multiplication can be interpreted as the area of a rectangle with varying edges. The result interval covers all possible areas, from smallest to the largest. With the help of these definitions, it is already possible to calculate the range of simple functions, such as f(a,b,x) = a \\\\cdot x + b. For example, if a = [1,2], b = [5,7] and x = [2,3]: :f(a,b,x) = ([1,2] \\\\cdot [2,3]) + [5,7] = [1 \\\\cdot 2, 2\\\\cdot 3] + [5,7] = [7,13]. =Notation= To make the notation of intervals smaller in formulae, brackets can be used. [x] \\\\equiv [x_1, x_2] can be used to represent an interval. Note that in such a compact notation, [x] should not be confused between a single-point interval [x_1, x_1] and a general interval. For the set of all intervals, we can use :[\\\\R] := \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\, [x_1, x_2] \\\\,\\\\, x_1 \\\\leq x_2 \\\\text{ and } x_1, x_2 \\\\in \\\\R \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{-\\\\infty, \\\\infty\\\\\\\\} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} as an abbreviation. For a vector of intervals \\\\left([x]_1, \\\\ldots , [x]_n \\\\right) \\\\in [\\\\R]^n we can use a bold font: [\\\\mathbf{x}]. =Elementary functions= Values of a monotonic function Interval functions beyond the four basic operators may also be defined. For monotonic functions in one variable, the range of values is simple to compute. If f: \\\\R \\\\to \\\\R is monotonically increasing or decreasing in the interval [x_1, x_2], then for all y_1, y_2 \\\\in [x_1, x_2] such that y_1 \\\\leq y_2, one of the following inequalities applies: :f(y_1) \\\\leq f(y_2) \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad f(y_1) \\\\geq f(y_2). The range corresponding to the interval [y_1, y_2] \\\\subseteq [x_1, x_2] can be therefore calculated by applying the function to its endpoints: :f([y_1, y_2]) = \\\\left[\\\\min \\\\left \\\\\\\\{f(y_1), f(y_2) \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f(y_1), f(y_2) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right]. From this, the following basic features for interval functions can easily be defined: * Exponential function: a^{[x_1, x_2]} = [a^{x_1},a^{x_2}] for a > 1, * Logarithm: \\\\log_a [x_1, x_2] = [\\\\log_a {x_1}, \\\\log_a {x_2}] for positive intervals [x_1, x_2] and a>1, * Odd powers: [x_1, x_2]^n = [x_1^n,x_2^n], for odd n\\\\in \\\\N. For even powers, the range of values being considered is important, and needs to be dealt with before doing any multiplication. For example, x^n for x \\\\in [-1,1] should produce the interval [0,1] when n = 2, 4, 6, \\\\ldots. But if [-1,1]^n is taken by repeating interval multiplication of form [-1,1]\\\\cdot [-1,1]\\\\cdot \\\\cdots \\\\cdot [-1,1] then the result is [-1,1], wider than necessary. More generally one can say that, for piecewise monotonic functions, it is sufficient to consider the endpoints x_1, x_2of an interval, together with the so-called critical points within the interval, being those points where the monotonicity of the function changes direction. For the sine and cosine functions, the critical points are at \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2} + n\\\\right)\\\\pi or n\\\\pi for n \\\\in \\\\Z, respectively. Thus, only up to five points within an interval need to be considered, as the resulting interval is [-1,1] if the interval includes at least two extrema. For sine and cosine, only the endpoints need full evaluation, as the critical points lead to easily pre-calculated values‚Äînamely -1, 0, and 1. =Interval extensions of general functions= In general, it may not be easy to find such a simple description of the output interval for many functions. But it may still be possible to extend functions to interval arithmetic. If f:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} is a function from a real vector to a real number, then [f]:[\\\\mathbb{R}]^n \\\\rightarrow [\\\\mathbb{R}] is called an interval extension of f if :[f]([\\\\mathbf{x}]) \\\\supseteq \\\\\\\\{f(\\\\mathbf{y})  \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{x}]\\\\\\\\}. This definition of the interval extension does not give a precise result. For example, both [f]([x_1,x_2]) =[e^{x_1}, e^{x_2}] and [g]([x_1,x_2]) =[{-\\\\infty}, {\\\\infty}] are allowable extensions of the exponential function. Tighter extensions are desirable, though the relative costs of calculation and imprecision should be considered; in this case, [f] should be chosen as it gives the tightest possible result. Given a real expression, its natural interval extension is achieved by using the interval extensions of each of its subexpressions, functions and operators. The Taylor interval extension (of degree k ) is a k+1 times differentiable function f defined by :[f]([\\\\mathbf{x}]) := f(\\\\mathbf{y}) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{1}{i!}\\\\mathrm{D}^i f(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\cdot ([\\\\mathbf{x}] - \\\\mathbf{y})^i + [r]([\\\\mathbf{x}], [\\\\mathbf{x}], \\\\mathbf{y}) , for some \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{x}], where \\\\mathrm{D}^i f(\\\\mathbf{y}) is the ith order differential of f at the point \\\\mathbf{y} and [r] is an interval extension of the Taylor remainder :r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\xi, \\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\frac{1}{(k+1)!}\\\\mathrm{D}^{k+1} f(\\\\xi) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{y})^{k+1}. Mean value form The vector \\\\xi lies between \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{y} with \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{x}], \\\\xi is protected by [\\\\mathbf{x}]. Usually one chooses \\\\mathbf{y} to be the midpoint of the interval and uses the natural interval extension to assess the remainder. The special case of the Taylor interval extension of degree k = 0 is also referred to as the mean value form. Complex interval arithmetic An interval can also be defined as a locus of points at a given distance from the centre, and this definition can be extended from real numbers to complex numbers. As it is the case with computing with real numbers, computing with complex numbers involves uncertain data. So, given the fact that an interval number is a real closed interval and a complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, there is no reason to limit the application of interval arithmetic to the measure of uncertainties in computations with real numbers. Interval arithmetic can thus be extended, via complex interval numbers, to determine regions of uncertainty in computing with complex numbers. The basic algebraic operations for real interval numbers (real closed intervals) can be extended to complex numbers. It is therefore not surprising that complex interval arithmetic is similar to, but not the same as, ordinary complex arithmetic. It can be shown that, as it is the case with real interval arithmetic, there is no distributivity between addition and multiplication of complex interval numbers except for certain special cases, and inverse elements do not always exist for complex interval numbers. Two other useful properties of ordinary complex arithmetic fail to hold in complex interval arithmetic: the additive and multiplicative properties, of ordinary complex conjugates, do not hold for complex interval conjugates. Interval arithmetic can be extended, in an analogous manner, to other multidimensional number systems such as quaternions and octonions, but with the expense that we have to sacrifice other useful properties of ordinary arithmetic. Interval methods The methods of classical numerical analysis can not be transferred one-to-one into interval-valued algorithms, as dependencies between numerical values are usually not taken into account. =Rounded interval arithmetic= Outer bounds at different level of rounding To work effectively in a real-life implementation, intervals must be compatible with floating point computing. The earlier operations were based on exact arithmetic, but in general fast numerical solution methods may not be available. The range of values of the function f(x, y) = x + y for x \\\\in [0.1, 0.8] and y \\\\in [0.06, 0.08] are for example [0.16, 0.88]. Where the same calculation is done with single digit precision, the result would normally be [0.2, 0.9]. But [0.2, 0.9] ot\\\\supseteq [0.16, 0.88], so this approach would contradict the basic principles of interval arithmetic, as a part of the domain of f([0.1, 0.8], [0.06, 0.08]) would be lost. Instead, the outward rounded solution [0.1, 0.9] is used. The standard IEEE 754 for binary floating-point arithmetic also sets out procedures for the implementation of rounding. An IEEE 754 compliant system allows programmers to round to the nearest floating point number; alternatives are rounding towards 0 (truncating), rounding toward positive infinity (i.e. up), or rounding towards negative infinity (i.e. down). The required external rounding for interval arithmetic can thus be achieved by changing the rounding settings of the processor in the calculation of the upper limit (up) and lower limit (down). Alternatively, an appropriate small interval [\\\\varepsilon_1, \\\\varepsilon_2] can be added. =Dependency problem= Approximate estimate of the value range The so-called dependency problem is a major obstacle to the application of interval arithmetic. Although interval methods can determine the range of elementary arithmetic operations and functions very accurately, this is not always true with more complicated functions. If an interval occurs several times in a calculation using parameters, and each occurrence is taken independently then this can lead to an unwanted expansion of the resulting intervals. Treating each occurrence of a variable independently As an illustration, take the function f defined by f(x) = x^2 + x. The values of this function over the interval [-1, 1] are \\\\left [-\\\\tfrac{1}{4}, 2 \\\\right ]. As the natural interval extension, it is calculated as: :[-1, 1]^2 + [-1, 1] = [0,1] + [-1,1] = [-1,2], which is slightly larger; we have instead calculated the infimum and supremum of the function h(x, y)= x^2+y over x, y \\\\in [-1,1]. There is a better expression of f in which the variable x only appears once, namely by rewriting f(x) = x^2 + x as addition and squaring in the quadratic :f(x) = \\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2 -\\\\frac{1}{4}. So the suitable interval calculation is :\\\\left([-1,1] + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2 -\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\left[-\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\right]^2 -\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\left[0, \\\\frac{9}{4}\\\\right] -\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\left[-\\\\frac{1}{4},2\\\\right] and gives the correct values. In general, it can be shown that the exact range of values can be achieved, if each variable appears only once and if f is continuous inside the box. However, not every function can be rewritten this way. Wrapping effect The dependency of the problem causing over-estimation of the value range can go as far as covering a large range, preventing more meaningful conclusions. An additional increase in the range stems from the solution of areas that do not take the form of an interval vector. The solution set of the linear system :\\\\begin{cases} x = p \\\\\\\\\\\\ y = p \\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad p\\\\in [-1,1] is precisely the line between the points (-1,-1) and (1,1). Using interval methods results in the unit square, [-1,1] \\\\times [-1,1]. This is known as the wrapping effect. =Linear interval systems= A linear interval system consists of a matrix interval extension [\\\\mathbf{A}] \\\\in [\\\\mathbb{R}]^{n\\\\times m} and an interval vector [\\\\mathbf{b}] \\\\in [\\\\mathbb{R}]^{n}. We want the smallest cuboid [\\\\mathbf{x}] \\\\in [\\\\mathbb{R}]^{m}, for all vectors \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m} which there is a pair (\\\\mathbf{A}, \\\\mathbf{b}) with \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{A}] and \\\\mathbf{b} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{b}] satisfying :\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b}. For quadratic systems - in other words, for n = m - there can be such an interval vector [\\\\mathbf{x}], which covers all possible solutions, found simply with the interval Gauss method. This replaces the numerical operations, in that the linear algebra method known as Gaussian elimination becomes its interval version. However, since this method uses the interval entities[\\\\mathbf{A}] and [\\\\mathbf{b}] repeatedly in the calculation, it can produce poor results for some problems. Hence using the result of the interval-valued Gauss only provides first rough estimates, since although it contains the entire solution set, it also has a large area outside it. A rough solution [\\\\mathbf{x}] can often be improved by an interval version of the Gauss‚ÄìSeidel method. The motivation for this is that the i-th row of the interval extension of the linear equation : \\\\begin{pmatrix} {[a_{11}]} & \\\\cdots & {[a_{1n}]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[a_{n1}]} & \\\\cdots & {[a_{nn}]} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{pmatrix} {x_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ {x_n} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} {[b_1]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[b_n]} \\\\end{pmatrix} can be determined by the variable x_i if the division 1/[a_{ii}] is allowed. It is therefore simultaneously :x_j \\\\in [x_j] and x_j \\\\in \\\\frac{[b_i]- \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k ot= j} [a_{ik}] \\\\cdot [x_k]}{[a_{ii}]}. So we can now replace [x_j] by :[x_j] \\\\cap \\\\frac{[b_i]- \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k ot= j} [a_{ik}] \\\\cdot [x_k]}{[a_{ii}]}, and so the vector [\\\\mathbf{x}] by each element. Since the procedure is more efficient for a diagonally dominant matrix, instead of the system [\\\\mathbf{A}]\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = [\\\\mathbf{b}]\\\\mbox{,} one can often try multiplying it by an appropriate rational matrix \\\\mathbf{M} with the resulting matrix equation :(\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\cdot[\\\\mathbf{A}])\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\cdot[\\\\mathbf{b}] left to solve. If one chooses, for example, \\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\mathbf{A}^{-1} for the central matrix \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{A}], then \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\cdot[\\\\mathbf{A}] is outer extension of the identity matrix. These methods only work well if the widths of the intervals occurring are sufficiently small. For wider intervals it can be useful to use an interval-linear system on finite (albeit large) real number equivalent linear systems. If all the matrices \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{A}] are invertible, it is sufficient to consider all possible combinations (upper and lower) of the endpoints occurring in the intervals. The resulting problems can be resolved using conventional numerical methods. Interval arithmetic is still used to determine rounding errors. This is only suitable for systems of smaller dimension, since with a fully occupied n \\\\times n matrix, 2^{n^2} real matrices need to be inverted, with 2^n vectors for the right hand side. This approach was developed by Jiri Rohn and is still being developed. =Interval Newton method= Reduction of the search area in the interval Newton step in \\"thick\\" functions An interval variant of Newton's method for finding the zeros in an interval vector [\\\\mathbf{x}] can be derived from the average value extension. For an unknown vector \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\in [\\\\mathbf{x}] applied to \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\in [\\\\mathbf{x}], gives :f(\\\\mathbf{z}) \\\\in f(\\\\mathbf{y}) + [J_f](\\\\mathbf{[x]}) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{z} - \\\\mathbf{y}). For a zero \\\\mathbf{z}, that is f(z)=0, and thus must satisfy : f(\\\\mathbf{y}) + [J_f](\\\\mathbf{[x]}) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{z} - \\\\mathbf{y})=0 . This is equivalent to \\\\mathbf{z} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{y} - [J_f](\\\\mathbf{[x]})^{-1}\\\\cdot f(\\\\mathbf{y}). An outer estimate of [J_f](\\\\mathbf{[x]})^{-1}\\\\cdot f(\\\\mathbf{y})) can be determined using linear methods. In each step of the interval Newton method, an approximate starting value [\\\\mathbf{x}]\\\\in [\\\\mathbb{R}]^n is replaced by [\\\\mathbf{x}]\\\\cap \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y} - [J_f](\\\\mathbf{[x]})^{-1}\\\\cdot f(\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\right) and so the result can be improved iteratively. In contrast to traditional methods, the interval method approaches the result by containing the zeros. This guarantees that the result produces all zeros in the initial range. Conversely, it proves that no zeros of f were in the initial range [\\\\mathbf{x}] if a Newton step produces the empty set. The method converges on all zeros in the starting region. Division by zero can lead to separation of distinct zeros, though the separation may not be complete; it can be complemented by the bisection method. As an example, consider the function f(x)= x^2-2, the starting range [x] = [-2,2], and the point y= 0. We then have J_f(x) = 2\\\\, x and the first Newton step gives :[-2,2]\\\\cap \\\\left(0 - \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\cdot[-2,2]} (0-2)\\\\right) = [-2,2]\\\\cap \\\\Big([{-\\\\infty}, {-0.5}]\\\\cup [{0.5}, {\\\\infty}] \\\\Big) = [{-2}, {-0.5}] \\\\cup [{0.5}, {2}]. More Newton steps are used separately on x\\\\in [{-2}, {-0.5}] and [{0.5}, {2}]. These converge to arbitrarily small intervals around -\\\\sqrt{2} and +\\\\sqrt{2}. The Interval Newton method can also be used with thick functions such as g(x)= x^2-[2,3], which would in any case have interval results. The result then produces intervals containing \\\\left[-\\\\sqrt{3},-\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\right] \\\\cup \\\\left[\\\\sqrt{2},\\\\sqrt{3} \\\\right]. =Bisection and covers= Rough estimate (turquoise) and improved estimates through \\"mincing\\" (red) The various interval methods deliver conservative results as dependencies between the sizes of different intervals extensions are not taken into account. However the dependency problem becomes less significant for narrower intervals. Covering an interval vector [\\\\mathbf{x}] by smaller boxes [\\\\mathbf{x}_1], \\\\ldots , [\\\\mathbf{x}_k], so that :[\\\\mathbf{x}] = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k [\\\\mathbf{x}_i], is then valid for the range of values :f([\\\\mathbf{x}]) = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k f([\\\\mathbf{x}_i]). So for the interval extensions described above the following holds: :[f]([\\\\mathbf{x}]) \\\\supseteq \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k [f]([\\\\mathbf{x}_i]). Since [f]([\\\\mathbf{x}]) is often a genuine superset of the right-hand side, this usually leads to an improved estimate. Such a cover can be generated by the bisection method such as thick elements [x_{i1}, x_{i2}] of the interval vector [\\\\mathbf{x}] = ([x_{11}, x_{12}], \\\\ldots, [x_{n1}, x_{n2}]) by splitting in the centre into the two intervals \\\\left [x_{i1}, \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(x_{i1}+x_{i2})\\\\right ] and \\\\left [ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(x_{i1}+x_{i2}), x_{i2} \\\\right ]. If the result is still not suitable then further gradual subdivision is possible. A cover of 2^r intervals results from r divisions of vector elements, substantially increasing the computation costs. With very wide intervals, it can be helpful to split all intervals into several subintervals with a constant (and smaller) width, a method known as mincing. This then avoids the calculations for intermediate bisection steps. Both methods are only suitable for problems of low dimension. Application Interval arithmetic can be used in various areas (such as set inversion, motion planning, set estimation or stability analysis) to treat estimates with no exact numerical value. =Rounding error analysis= Interval arithmetic is used with error analysis, to control rounding errors arising from each calculation. The advantage of interval arithmetic is that after each operation there is an interval that reliably includes the true result. The distance between the interval boundaries gives the current calculation of rounding errors directly: : Error = \\\\mathrm{abs}(a-b) for a given interval [a,b]. Interval analysis adds to rather than substituting for traditional methods for error reduction, such as pivoting. =Tolerance analysis= Parameters for which no exact figures can be allocated often arise during the simulation of technical and physical processes. The production process of technical components allows certain tolerances, so some parameters fluctuate within intervals. In addition, many fundamental constants are not known precisely. If the behavior of such a system affected by tolerances satisfies, for example, f(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{p}) = 0, for \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{p}] and unknown \\\\mathbf{x} then the set of possible solutions :\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\,\\\\, \\\\exists \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\in [\\\\mathbf{p}], f(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{p})= 0\\\\\\\\}, can be found by interval methods. This provides an alternative to traditional propagation of error analysis. Unlike point methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation, interval arithmetic methodology ensures that no part of the solution area can be overlooked. However, the result is always a worst-case analysis for the distribution of error, as other probability-based distributions are not considered. =Fuzzy interval arithmetic= Approximation of the normal distribution by a sequence of intervals Interval arithmetic can also be used with affiliation functions for fuzzy quantities as they are used in fuzzy logic. Apart from the strict statements x\\\\in [x] and x ot\\\\in [x], intermediate values are also possible, to which real numbers \\\\mu \\\\in [0,1] are assigned. \\\\mu = 1 corresponds to definite membership while \\\\mu = 0 is non- membership. A distribution function assigns uncertainty, which can be understood as a further interval. For fuzzy arithmetic only a finite number of discrete affiliation stages \\\\mu_i \\\\in [0,1] are considered. The form of such a distribution for an indistinct value can then represented by a sequence of intervals :\\\\left[x^{(1)}\\\\right] \\\\supset \\\\left[x^{(2)}\\\\right] \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset \\\\left[x^{(k)} \\\\right]. The interval \\\\left [x^{(i)} \\\\right ] corresponds exactly to the fluctuation range for the stage \\\\mu_i. The appropriate distribution for a function f(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) concerning indistinct values x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n and the corresponding sequences :\\\\left[x_1^{(1)} \\\\right] \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset \\\\left[x_1^{(k)} \\\\right], \\\\ldots, \\\\left[x_n^{(1)} \\\\right] \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset \\\\left[x_n^{(k)} \\\\right] can be approximated by the sequence :\\\\left[y^{(1)}\\\\right] \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset \\\\left[y^{(k)}\\\\right], where :\\\\left[y^{(i)}\\\\right] = f \\\\left( \\\\left[x_{1}^{(i)}\\\\right], \\\\ldots \\\\left[x_{n}^{(i)}\\\\right]\\\\right) and can be calculated by interval methods. The value \\\\left[y^{(1)}\\\\right] corresponds to the result of an interval calculation. =Computer-assisted proof= Warwick Tucker used interval arithmetic in order to solve the 14th of Smale's problems, that is, to show that the Lorenz attractor is a strange attractor. Thomas Hales used interval arithmetic in order to solve the Kepler conjecture. History Interval arithmetic is not a completely new phenomenon in mathematics; it has appeared several times under different names in the course of history. For example, Archimedes calculated lower and upper bounds 223/71 < œÄ < 22/7 in the 3rd century BC. Actual calculation with intervals has neither been as popular as other numerical techniques nor been completely forgotten. Rules for calculating with intervals and other subsets of the real numbers were published in a 1931 work by Rosalind Cicely Young. Arithmetic work on range numbers to improve the reliability of digital systems were then published in a 1951 textbook on linear algebra by ; intervals were used to measure rounding errors associated with floating-point numbers. A comprehensive paper on interval algebra in numerical analysis was published by Teruo Sunaga (1958). The birth of modern interval arithmetic was marked by the appearance of the book Interval Analysis by Ramon E. Moore in 1966. He had the idea in spring 1958, and a year later he published an article about computer interval arithmetic. Its merit was that starting with a simple principle, it provided a general method for automated error analysis, not just errors resulting from rounding. Independently in 1956, Mieczyslaw Warmus suggested formulae for calculations with intervals, though Moore found the first non- trivial applications. In the following twenty years, German groups of researchers carried out pioneering work around Ulrich W. Kulisch and at the University of Karlsruhe and later also at the Bergische University of Wuppertal. For example, explored more effective implementations, while improved containment procedures for the solution set of systems of equations were due to Arnold Neumaier among others. In the 1960s, Eldon R. Hansen dealt with interval extensions for linear equations and then provided crucial contributions to global optimisation, including what is now known as Hansen's method, perhaps the most widely used interval algorithm. Classical methods in this often have the problem of determining the largest (or smallest) global value, but could only find a local optimum and could not find better values; Helmut Ratschek and Jon George Rokne developed branch and bound methods, which until then had only applied to integer values, by using intervals to provide applications for continuous values. In 1988, Rudolf Lohner developed Fortran- based software for reliable solutions for initial value problems using ordinary differential equations. The journal Reliable Computing (originally Interval Computations) has been published since the 1990s, dedicated to the reliability of computer-aided computations. As lead editor, R. Baker Kearfott, in addition to his work on global optimisation, has contributed significantly to the unification of notation and terminology used in interval arithmetic. In recent years work has concentrated in particular on the estimation of preimages of parameterised functions and to robust control theory by the COPRIN working group of INRIA in Sophia Antipolis in France. Implementations There are many software packages that permit the development of numerical applications using interval arithmetic. These are usually provided in the form of program libraries. There are also C++ and Fortran compilers that handle interval data types and suitable operations as a language extension, so interval arithmetic is supported directly. Since 1967, Extensions for Scientific Computation (XSC) have been developed in the University of Karlsruhe for various programming languages, such as C++, Fortran and Pascal. The first platform was a Zuse Z23, for which a new interval data type with appropriate elementary operators was made available. There followed in 1976, Pascal-SC, a Pascal variant on a Zilog Z80 that it made possible to create fast, complicated routines for automated result verification. Then came the Fortran 77-based ACRITH-XSC for the System/370 architecture (FORTRAN-SC), which was later delivered by IBM. Starting from 1991 one could produce code for C compilers with Pascal-XSC; a year later the C++ class library supported C-XSC on many different computer systems. In 1997, all XSC variants were made available under the GNU General Public License. At the beginning of 2000 C-XSC 2.0 was released under the leadership of the working group for scientific computation at the Bergische University of Wuppertal to correspond to the improved C++ standard. Another C++-class library was created in 1993 at the Hamburg University of Technology called Profil/BIAS (Programmer's Runtime Optimized Fast Interval Library, Basic Interval Arithmetic), which made the usual interval operations more user friendly. It emphasized the efficient use of hardware, portability and independence of a particular presentation of intervals. The Boost collection of C++ libraries contains a template class for intervals. Its authors are aiming to have interval arithmetic in the standard C++ language. The Frink programming language has an implementation of interval arithmetic that handles arbitrary-precision numbers. Programs written in Frink can use intervals without rewriting or recompilation. Gaol is another C++ interval arithmetic library that is unique in that it offers the relational interval operators used in interval constraint programming. The Moore library is an efficient implementation of interval arithmetic in C++. It provides intervals with endpoints of arbitrary precision and is based on the \`\`concepts¬¥¬¥ feature of C++. The Julia programming language has an implementation of interval arithmetics along with high-level features, such as root-finding (for both real and complex-valued functions) and interval constraint programming, via the ValidatedNumerics.jl package. In addition computer algebra systems, such as FriCAS, Mathematica, Maple, Maxima (software) and MuPAD, can handle intervals. A Matlab extension Intlab builds on BLAS routines, and the Toolbox b4m makes a Profil/BIAS interface. Moreover, the Software Euler Math Toolbox includes an interval arithmetic. A library for the functional language OCaml was written in assembly language and C. IEEE 1788 standard A standard for interval arithmetic, IEEE Std 1788-2015, has been approved in June 2015. Two reference implementations are freely available. These have been developed by members of the standard's working group: The libieeep1788 library for C++, and the interval package for GNU Octave. A minimal subset of the standard, IEEE Std 1788.1-2017, has been approved in December 2017 and published in February 2018. It should be easier to implement and may speed production of implementations. Conferences and workshops Several international conferences or workshop take place every year in the world. The main conference is probably SCAN (International Symposium on Scientific Computing, Computer Arithmetic, and Verified Numerical Computation), but there is also SWIM (Small Workshop on Interval Methods), PPAM (International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics), REC (International Workshop on Reliable Engineering Computing).

The section of the route from junction 11 on the M7 at Kilcullen to the intersection with the N24 road outside Waterford is motorway standard since 2010 and is designated as the M9 motorway. In line with Irish practice, all sections previously designated N9 were renumbered at that time. Only a short (550-metre) section of the route is still designated as N9 between the Quarry roundabout junction with the N24 and the N25 Grannagh Roundabout junction. This section is dual carriageway. Route The route starts as motorway southwest of Newbridge (see thumbnail), and on the southwest side of Kilcullen. Prior to the 1993 opening of the Newbridge bypass, the N9 had run from Naas (east of the current M9). The previous route is now the R448. The previous route continued south through Kilgowan, the intersection with the N78 to Athy, Ballitore, the R747, Timolin, Moone and through Castledermot in County Kildare. This is currently bypassed by the Kilcullen to Carlow section of the M9 opened in December 2009. This then joins with another stretch of motorway, opened 29 May 2008 bypassing Carlow, meeting the R448 at a junction near Powerstown. Further south, the M9 crosses the River Barrow bypassing Leighlinbridge to the west, and continuing south to pass west of Muine Bheag (Bagnelstown), then entering County Kilkenny. At Paulstown the N10 diverges west/southwest to serve Kilkenny and the present section of the M9. The M9 bypasses Gowran, Dungarvan and Thomastown. This section of the N9 opened as motorway in September 2010 and completed the M9 motorway. Motorists join the M9 via the N10 from Kilkenny onto the M9 section from Danesfort to Waterford. From Powerstown and further on, just north of Ballyhale the former N10 rejoins the R448, having proceeded south from Kilkenny. Lukeswell, Mullinavat and Dunkitt lie along the R448 route south towards Waterford. The M9 ends at the Quarry roundabout junction with the N24. A short section of the route designated as N9 continues towards the Granagh interchange where the route terminates and intersects with the N25 Waterford bypass. M9 motorway and upgrades The National Development Plan included plans for a motorway from Dublin to Waterford. While these plans were later altered to High Quality Dual Carriageway, in July 2008 the road was reclassified as a motorway once more. An environmental impact assessment was published in October 2003 and a CPO issued in November 2003 for the dual- carriageway forming the northern part of the Kilcullen-Waterford route, from Kilcullen, County Kildare to Powerstown, County Carlow. An EIS was published and a CPO issued in February 2005 for the southern section of the upgraded route, from Powerstown to Waterford. The southern section of route differs more from the former N9 alignment than most of the national road upgrade projects in recent years. The N10 provides a link to Kilkenny, to the west of the M9. The new alignment of the M9 passes further west, closer to Kilkenny, with a new shorter N10 link to the M9 on the northeast side of Kilkenny. The N10 remains as far as Danesfort for the link southeast of Kilkenny. The timeline of upgrades to the former N9 route was: *M9 Kilcullen to Carlow; 28 km, completed and opened in December 2009 *The Carlow Bypass was the first section of the project to be completed, opening on 29 May 2008. It opened as a section of the N9, although built to motorway standards; and was officially upgraded to motorway (complete with a 20 km/h increase in speed limit) on 24 September 2008. *M9/N10 Carlow/Knocktopher ; 40 km, completed and opened on 9 September 2010 *M9 Waterford/Knocktopher; 24 km, completed and opened 22 March 2010. A bypass of Waterford was opened in 2009, as part of the N25 that previously passed southeast/northwest through the city. As part of the project, the new M9 joins at a roundabout just off the Granagh Interchange which then allows access to Waterford City or the bypass to Rosslare/Cork.

They wrote the history of Rome from the earliest times (in most cases) down to their own days, the events of which were treated in much greater detail. This cites: * C. W.

Wachsmuth, Einleitung in das Studium der alien Geschichte (1895) * H. Peter, bibliography of the subject in Bursian's Jahresbericht, cxxvi. (1906) Annalists were different from historians, in that an annalist was more likely to just record events for reference purposes, rather than offering their own opinions of events. There is, however, some overlap between the two categories and sometimes annalist is used to refer to both styles of writing from the Roman era. Different generations For the earlier period, the authorities of annalists were to record state and family records--above all, the annales maximi (or annales pontificum), the official chronicle of Rome, in which the notable occurrences of each year from the foundation of the city were set down by the Pontifex Maximus. Although these annals were no doubt destroyed at the time of the burning of Rome by the Gauls, they were restored as far as possible and continued until the pontificate of P. Mucius Scaevola, by whom they were finally published in eighty books. Two generations of these annalists have been distinguished--an older and a younger. The older, which extends to 150 BCE, set forth, in bald, unattractive language, without any pretensions to style, but with a certain amount of trustworthiness, the most important events of each successive year. Cicero (De Oratore, ii. 12. 53), comparing these writers with the old Ionic logographers, says that they paid no attention to ornament, and considered the only merits of a writer to be intelligibility and conciseness. Their annals were a mere compilation of facts. The younger generation, in view of the requirements and criticism of a reading public, cultivated the art of composition and rhetorical embellishment. As a general rule the annalists wrote in a spirit of uncritical patriotism, which led them to minimize or gloss over such disasters as the conquest of Rome by Porsena and the compulsory payment of ransom to the Gauls, and to flatter the people by exaggerated accounts of Roman prowess, dressed up in fanciful language. At first they wrote in Greek, partly because a national style was not yet formed, and partly because Greek was the fashionable language amongst the educated, although Latin versions were probably published as well. The first of the annalists, the father of Roman history, as he has been called, was Q. Fabius Pictor; contemporary with him was Lucius Cincius Alimentus, who flourished during the Hannibalic war (not to be confused with L. Cincius, the author of various political and antiquarian treatises (de Fastis, de Comitiis, de Priscis Verbis), who lived in the Augustan age, to which period Mommsen, considering them a later fabrication, refers the Greek annals of L. Cincius Alimentus). Like Fabius Pictor, he wrote in Greek. He was taken prisoner by Hannibal (Livy xxi. 38), who is said to have given him details of the crossing of the Alps. His work embraced the history of Rome from its foundation down to his own days. With M. Porcius Cato historical composition in Latin began, and a livelier interest was awakened in the history of Rome. Notable writers Among the principal writers of this class who succeeded Cato, the following may be mentioned: * L. Cassius Hemina (about 146 BCE), in the fourth book of his Annals, wrote on the Second Punic War. His researches went back to very early times; Pliny (Nat. Hist. xiii. 13 [27]) calls him vetustissimus auctor annalium. * L. Calpurnius Piso, surnamed Frugi, wrote seven books of annals, relating the history of the city from its foundation down to his own times. Livy regards him as a less trustworthy authority than Fabius Pictor, and Niebuhr considers him the first to introduce systematic forgeries into Roman history. * Q. Claudius Quadrigarius (about 80 BCE) wrote a history, in at least twenty-three books, which began with the conquest of Rome by the Gauls and went down to the death of Sulla or perhaps later. He was freely used by Livy in part of his work (from the sixth book onwards). A long fragment is preserved in Aulus Gellius (ix. 13), giving an account of the single combat between Manlius Torquatus and the Gaul. His language was antiquated and his style dry, but his work was considered important. * Valerius Antias, a younger contemporary of Quadrigarius, wrote the history of Rome from the earliest times, in a voluminous work consisting of seventy-five books. He is notorious for his wilful exaggeration, both in narrative and numerical statements. For instance, he asserts the number of the Sabine virgins to have been exactly 527; again, in a certain year when no Greek or Latin writers mention any important campaign, Antias speaks of a big battle with enormous casualties. Nevertheless, Livy at first made use of him as one of his chief authorities, until he became convinced of his untrustworthiness. * G. Licinius Macer (died 66 BC), who has been called the last of the annalists, wrote a voluminous work, which, although he paid great attention to the study of his authorities, was too rhetorical, and exaggerated the achievements of his own family. Having been convicted of extortion, he committed suicide (Cicero, De Legibus, i. 2, Brutus, 67; Plutarch, Cicero, 9). Other annalists The writers mentioned dealt with Roman history as a whole; some of the annalists, however, confined themselves to shorter periods: * L. Coelius Antipater (about 120 BCE) limited himself to the Second Punic War. His work was overloaded with rhetorical embellishment, which he was the first to introduce into Roman history. He was regarded as the most careful writer on the war with Hannibal, and one who did not allow himself to be blinded by partiality in considering the evidence of other writers (Cicero, De Oratore, ii. 12). Livy made great use of him in his third decade. * Sempronius Asellio (about 100 BCE), military tribune of Scipio Africanus at the siege of Numantia, composed Rerum Gestarum Libri in at least fourteen books. As he himself took part in the events he describes, his work was a kind of memoirs. He was the first of his class who endeavoured to trace the causes of events, instead of contenting himself with a bare statement of facts. * L. Cornelius Sisenna (119-67), legate of Pompey in the war against the pirates, lost his life in an expedition against Crete. He wrote twenty-three books on the period between the Social War and the dictatorship of Sulla. His work was commended by Sallust (Jugurtha, 95), who, however, blames him for not speaking out sufficiently. Cicero remarks upon his fondness for archaisms (Brutus, 74. 259). Sisenna also translated the tales of Aristides of Miletus, and is supposed by some to have written a commentary on Plautus. The autobiography of Sulla may also be mentioned.

Riders can often become airborne while passing over waves or wake from the motor boat or personal watercraft. Tubing (also known as inner tubing, bumper tubing, towed tubing (Kite Tubing) or just tubing) is a recreational activity where an individual rides on top of an inner tube, either on water, snow, or through the air. The tubes themselves are also known as \\"donuts\\" or \\"biscuits\\" due to their shape. Variations =Water= A mother holds two children in an automobile inner tube floating on an unidentified body of water in 1916. Towed tubing behind a personal watercraft on the Mississippi River Free-floating tubers on alt=People in inner tubes wearing lifejackets in a whitewater stream just above a small drop over a rock Tubing on water generally consists of two forms: towed and free-floating, also known as river tubing. There is also water skiing. According to Time Magazine, tubing was purportedly invented in Thailand by Princes Chumbhot of Nagar Svarga sometime in the middle of the 20th century,\\"Thailand: Holder of the Kingdom, Strength of the Land\\", Time Magazine, , 1966, accessed , 2010. but examples of the practice were published as early as 1916,\\"Better Try It,\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune. Aug. 3, 1916. Page 10. when the popularization of the automobile meant a large supply of rubber inner tubes was available to the general public. Towed tubing usually takes place on a large body of water such as a lake or river. One or more tube riders (often called \\"tubers\\") tether their tubes to a powered watercraft such as a motor boat or a personal watercraft. The riders are then towed through the water by the watercraft. In free floating tubing, the tube riders are untethered and often conveyed by the current of a waterway. Tubers paddle with their hands and often use webbed gloves to steer. Tubes can be outfitted with tube covers or 'skins'. These covers are fabric, and cover the bottom of the tube, the sides, and have a skirt that covers the inner diameter, while leaving room for the tuber to sit. Covers can be altered with pockets, can holders and have handles for the tuber to hold on to. It is strongly discouraged to tie anything to the tube or use ropes of any kind as a tuber can get bound or wrapped in them and potentially drown. The Esopus Creek in the Catskill Mountains, New York is a common place for tubing, starting in Phoenicia and proceeding eastward. As in all watersports tubers should wear appropriate safety gear such as life vests, protective water shoes and helmets. Whitewater tubing can be fun and exhilarating, the size of the tube allows a tuber to ride the river in an unencumbered manner not found in rafting or kayaking. Tubers can employ the use of such items as dry boxes and mesh bags to carry small personal items and pack out trash, cans and bottles from their trip. Popular riverside tube rentals normally warn against glass due to riverside dangers. Some law enforcement offices have prohibited kegs which were popularly chilled in metal tubs harnessed within larger tubes.Michigan Canoe Rental, Chippewa River Outfitters, canoeing, rafting kayaking canoe michigan waterways , kayaking, tubing Major water parks often have specially designed courses for tubing called lazy rivers. These may consist of a circular, artificial river on which riders are conveyed or a linear course such as a water slide. =Snow= magic carpet used to deliver the tubers back up the run from the bottom. Snow tubing is rumored to have begun as far back as the 1820s in the Alpine Mountains. Tubing on snow is a wintertime activity that is similar to sledding. This kind of tubing is almost always performed on a hill or slope, using gravity to propel the rider to the bottom of the grade. The rider often returns to the top of the slope with the tube to repeat the process. The low amount of friction between most tubes and snow allows tubers to reach considerable speeds while riding, especially on steep slopes. Because of the circular shape of snow tubes, controlling the course and speed of a tube while riding on snow is extremely difficult. While a sled rider can drag their arms on the snow to brake or steer to a degree, attempting this on a tube will often cause the tube to spin. This lack of control has led to injuries, some serious, when riders have struck obstacles such as trees while tubing on snow. Some ski resorts offer courses devoted solely to tubing. Such courses often have slopes or barriers on the periphery to guide the tubes along a safe course. Motorized pulley towlines are often used to tow riders and their tube back to the top of the course after riding to the bottom. Adventure Point At Keystone Resort in Colorado offers snow tubing late into the summer .Their elevation has been known to provide enough snow to last through the month of July. Steamboat Springs, Colorado ski mountain offers night snow tubing in ski season. It is also possible to tow a tube through the snow behind a snowmobile. This is similar to towed tubing on water, only the watercraft is replaced by a snowmobile and the water with snow-covered ground. =Kite tubing= A variant of towed tubing dubbed \\"kite tubing\\" has begun to emerge. When tubes being towed on water reach high speeds, they may take flight. This is because the body of the tube acts as an airfoil and creates lift. In this way, the tube becomes a kite. A tube's ability to achieve and maintain flight depends on a number of factors including the speed at which the tube is traveling, the shape and size of the tube, the weight of the rider, and how the tube itself is oriented. As most tubes are not designed for flight, the rider often has little or no control over a tube after it takes to the air. This can lead to a violent crash as the rider, with or without the tube, falls back to the surface of the water. To address the poor flight characteristics of most tubes and to target thrill seekers, tubes specially designed for kite tubing have been introduced. These tubes may feature channels to allow air to flow through the tube's body, a transparent \\"window\\" for the rider to signal the boat operator, as well as more streamlined, aerodynamic designs. As of July 2006, 39 injuries and two deaths from kite tubing have been reported. Injuries have included a broken neck, punctured lung, cracked ribs, a concussion and injuries to the chest, back and face. Some accidents have been linked to gusts of wind that unexpectedly altered the flight characteristics and ejected the riders. In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Sportsstuff Inc. voluntarily withdrew the Wego Kite Tube from the market on , 2006. Related to kite tubing is the kited inflated wing, a stiffened, flexible wing or gas-inflated bladder wing, where a control bar is affixed for the kited person to direct the inflated wing so the dangerous lock-out does not occur. The kited person can have a quick disconnect to release from a towing boat or car if a dangerous angle of tow begins.Inflated wing patent, 1938Inflatable wing, 1975Inflated wing, 1986 =Summer tubing= Neveplast summer tubing Summer tubing is the summer variant of snow tubing. Hard bottom tubes slide down artificial slopes, usually made of special plastic. They can be installed on mountains by ski resorts or you can find them also in amusement parks. In Europe produced by Neveplast, Tubingsystem and Mr. Snow. Summer tubing track with Mr. Snow modules Equipment Piles of snow tubes Tubing can require varying pieces and kinds of equipment depending on the variety of tubing one wishes to engage in. The one common piece of equipment across all forms of tubing is the tube itself. While tubes vary in construction, all share the general characteristics of being: *Inflatable *Made of a thin, flexible, synthetic material such as rubber or PVC plastic *Donut, disk, or hot dog shaped =Water= Tubes for use as towables on water are generally not true inner tubes but rather specially designed tubes for the purpose of recreation. These tubes are often fairly durable and come in either donut or disk shapes. A sleeve of synthetic fabric often covers the tube to prevent it from becoming elongated during towing. Such sleeves commonly have handles for the rider to grasp and an anchoring point for the tow line to be attached at. Towing a tube or tubes also requires a powered watercraft such a motorboat or personal watercraft as well as rope to tether the tubes to such craft. Tubes used for free-floating tubing have traditionally been true inner tubes, but commercially sold tubes for the same purpose are becoming common place. These tubes are almost always donut-shaped to allow the rider to sit comfortably on their back across the top of the tube with buttocks in the center. This kind of tube rarely has handles or a sleeve and would perform poorly as a towable. Another type of water tube has a wooden panel inserted across the hole in the middle of the tube to prevent rocks in the river popping up into the tube and injuring the rider in shallow water areas. =Snow= Tubes used for riding on snow are sometimes specially designed tubes with dimpled centers rather than a \\"donut\\" hole. This prevents the rider and the tube itself from dragging on the snow. Snow tubes may be designed to have handles. Dangers There are many dangers that are associated with tubing regardless of the variation of tubing. = Water = From 1991 to 2009, towed tubing injuries saw injuries increase at a rate of 250%. This amounted to 7,216 injuries alone in 2009. The increase in injuries is a result of the increase in popularity of the recreational activity. As a result, it is important that proper safety measures are in place. Proper inflation of the tube is especially important. This prevents the body from being caught between the tube and nylon cover that goes over it. With an underinflated tube it is possible for the rider to be caught and dragged under water. Towed tubing also provides dangers if not performed in an open area away from other obstacles such as docks, piers, and other boaters. Injuries can further occur during the ride. In kids, one study found injuries to the head to be common while adults suffered sprains to the knees. This discrepancy between age groups is believed to be a result of younger riders trying to fit more than one person on a tube. There is still danger after riders are flown from the tube. If the boat operator does not disengage the motor when picking up a tube rider from the water, there is a chance that the body of the person in the water could get caught in the motor. This can cause body disfigurement or even death depending on the severity of the injury and the time until proper medical attention is received. Dangers still exist for water tubing that is not towed tubing. Non- towed water tubing takes place at a slower rate than towed tubing. As a result, tubers are more at risk of water dangers. For instance, insects such as ants and water moccasins have been known to attack tubers. The surrounding terrain of the water can also present their own dangers. Rapids can eject a rider from their tube causing them to land to rocks or other terrain. Non- towed tubing is often an all day thing, so things such as sunburns also present a risk. Furthermore, people often engage in excessive drinking leading to a state of drunkenness that can pose a danger to other tubers and to themselves as alcohol poisoning is common at some popular tubing locations. = Snow = Snow tubing incidents are also becoming increasingly common. The common cause of the incidents is blunt force trauma as a result of the rider colliding into a fixed object at high speeds. This frequently results in head and neck injuries. Due to the location of these injuries, death is not uncommon as was seen in 2015 when a snow-tube rider fatally collided with a light pole.

The official definition of the Yale District and Yale ridings (that is, the original Yale riding, not the second) is all of both the Yale and Kootenay Land Districts, which took in the whole of the province from the Fraser Canyon to the Rocky Mountains and including the Kamloops and Shuswap areas.

After his defeat at Kirina, he flees into the mountains of Koulikoro, where he \\"disappears\\" after being shot with only weapon to which he is vulnerable - an arrow with a white rooster crest on it. In the Epic of Sundiata, Soumaoro Kant√© is described as owning a balafon with magical powers, which is stolen by Sundiata Keita's djeli, Balafasseke Kouyate, and brought to Manden.Editor: Senghor, L√©opold S√©dar, √âthiopiques, Issues 21-24, Grande imprimerie africaine, 1980, p 79 This is the origin of the Manden djeli tradition of balafon playing. The balafon of Soumaoro Kant√© is said to be kept by the Kouyate family to this day in the village of Niagassola in Guinea. Soumaoro is viewed as one of the true champions of Traditional African religion due to his reputation in the epic as someone possessing extraordinary magical powers. According to Fyle, Soumaoro was the inventor of the balafon and the dan (a four-string guitar used by the hunters and griots).Fyle, Magbaily, Introduction to the History of African Civilization: Precolonial Africa, University Press of America (1999), p. 61, As evidence of his supernatural powers, the griot Lansine Diabate notes \\"At that time, owing to his magical powers, every fly which rested on the balafon of Soso [the royal musician], Sunaworo was able to find it out from a cloud of flies and kill it.\\" Diabate goes on to say that it was when the balafon player first refused to play for the king that Soumaoro Kant√©'s demise was anticipated.

The crash occurred in Los Gatos Canyon and not in the town of Los Gatos itself, which is in Santa Clara County, approximately 150 miles away. Guthrie was inspired to write the song by what he considered the racist mistreatment of the passengers before and after the accident. The crash resulted in the deaths of 32 people, 4 Americans and 28 migrant farm workers who were being deported from California back to Mexico.  History  Woody Guthrie. The genesis of \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\" reportedly occurred when Guthrie was struck by the fact that radio and newspaper coverage of the Los Gatos plane crash did not give the victims' names, but instead referred to them merely as \\"deportees.\\" Guthrie lived in New York City at the time, and none of the deportees' names were printed in the January 29, 1948, New York Times report, only those of the flight crew and the security guard. However, the local newspaper, The Fresno Bee, covered the tragedy extensively and listed all of the known names of the deportees. Unaware of the extensive local coverage of the disaster, Guthrie responded with a poem, which, when it was first written, featured only rudimentary musical accompaniment, with Guthrie chanting the song rather than singing it. In the poem, Guthrie assigned symbolic names to the dead: \\"Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita; adi√≥s, mis amigos, Jes√∫s y Mar√≠a...\\" A decade later, Guthrie's poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman. Shortly after, folk singer Pete Seeger, a friend of Woody Guthrie, began performing the song at concerts, and it was Seeger's rendition that popularized the song during this time. It has been suggested by the Three Rocks Research website that, in fact, \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\" betrays Guthrie's lack of understanding regarding the Bracero Program. The program was a series of laws and diplomatic agreements created by the U.S. Congress in 1942, that permitted Mexican farm laborers (or Braceros) to work in the United States due to the severe labor shortages caused by World War II. Under the terms of the program, the labor contractors were expected to provide transportation to and from the Mexican border, with the U.S. Immigration Service being required to repatriate the Mexican citizens if the contractor defaulted. As such, the \\"deportation\\" of Braceros in this fashion was simply a way of meeting the obligations of the program‚Äîalthough some newspapers, e.g., the New York Times, did refer to the braceros as \\"deportees\\". However, the presence in the song of the lines, \\"Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted/Our work contract's out and we have to move on.\\" suggests that Guthrie did in fact understand the workings of the Bracero Program. Furthermore, it could be argued that Guthrie's song is less about the program itself and more a comment on the attitude of American society and the media towards the Mexican farm laborers. In addition to being a lament for the braceros killed in the crash, the opening lines of \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\": > The crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning, The oranges piled in > their creosote dumps.\\" are another protest by Guthrie. At the time, government policies paid farmers to destroy their crops in order to keep farm production and prices high. Guthrie felt that it was wrong to render food inedible by poisoning it in a world where hungry people lived. \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\" has been described by journalist Joe Klein as \\"the last great song he [Guthrie] would write, a memorial to the nameless migrants 'all scattered like dry leaves' in Los Gatos Canyon.\\" The song has been recorded many times, often under a variety of other titles, including \\"Deportees\\", \\"Ballad of the Deportees\\", \\"Deportee Song\\", \\"Plane Crash at Los Gatos\\" and \\"Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee)\\".

The two red vertical lines are both straight, but they may look as if they are bowed inwards to some observers. The distortion is induced by the crooked lines on the background, as in the Orbison illusion. The Hering illusion produces a similar, but inverted effect. Vertical-horizontal illusion the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion Another variant of the Wundt illusion is the Horizontal‚ÄìVertical Illusion, introduced by Wundt in 1858. The two intersecting lines are equal in length although the vertical line appears to be much longer. The horizontal line needs to be extended up to 30% to match the perceptual length of the vertical line. This is not confined to simple line drawings, as this can also be seen in buildings, parking meters, as well as other things viewed in a natural setting.

It reflects his despair over his increasing deafness, even his contemplation of suicide, and his continued desire to overcome his physical and emotional ailments to complete his artistic destiny. Beethoven kept the document hidden among his private papers for the rest of his life, and probably never showed it to anyone. It was discovered in March 1827, after Beethoven's death, by Anton Schindler and Stephan von Breuning, who had it published the following October. A curiosity of the document is that, while Carl's name appears in the appropriate places, blank spaces are left where Johann's name should appear (as in the upper right corner of the accompanying image). There have been numerous proposed explanations for this, ranging from Beethoven's uncertainty as to whether Johann's full name (Nikolaus Johann) should be used on this quasi-legal document, to his mixed feelings of attachment to his brothers, to transference of his lifelong hatred of the boys' alcoholic, abusive father (ten years dead in 1802), also named Johann. Since 1888, the original document has been in the Carl von Ossietzky State and University Library at Hamburg, a gift from the Swedish singer Jenny Lind.

This article describes several of these traditions.  Football  = Beginnings of football at Alabama = According to a November 25, 1926 article in The Crimson White, football was first introduced at the University of Alabama in 1892 by W.G. Little of Livingston, Alabama, who had been a student at Andover, Massachusetts and \\"went to the University for the game.\\" Alabama's first football game was played in Birmingham on Friday afternoon, November 11, 1892, at the old Lakeview Park. Alabama defeated a team composed mostly of high schoolers 56-0. That Saturday, November 12, Alabama played the Birmingham Athletic Club, losing 5-4 when Ross, of B.A.C., kicked a 65-yard field goal. This field goal was a collegiate record at the time. In 1896 the university's board of trustees passed a rule forbidding athletic teams from traveling off- campus. The following season only one game was played and in 1898 football was abandoned at Alabama. Student opposition to the ruling forced trustees to lift the travel ban and football was resumed in 1899. The 1918 season was cancelled on account of World War I but the game was resumed the following year. Alabama first gained national recognition for football in 1922 when it defeated the University of Pennsylvania 9-7 in Philadelphia. The following season Wallace Wade became head coach and in 1925 led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated and untied season and its first trip to Pasadena, California, with a Rose Bowl invitation. On January 1, 1926, in the Rose Bowl, Alabama came from behind to upset the University of Washington 20-19. = The Crimson Tide = Early newspaper accounts of the university's football squad simply referred to them as the \\"varsity\\" or the \\"Crimson White\\". The first nickname popular with the media was the \\"Thin Red Line\\", which was used until 1906. Hugh Roberts, former sports editor of the Birmingham Age-Herald, is credited with coining the phrase \\"Crimson Tide\\" in an article describing the 1907 Iron Bowl played in Birmingham with Auburn a heavy favorite to win. The game was played in a sea of red mud which stained the Alabama white jerseys crimson. The headline for the article was \\"Crimson Tied\\", referring to the 6‚Äì6 tie Alabama had with Auburn, who had been heavily favored before the game. = The Elephant = There are two stories, perhaps both true, about how Alabama's football squad became associated with the elephant, both dating to the coaching tenure of Wallace Wade (1923-1930). The earliest account attributes the Rosenberger's Birmingham Trunk Company for the elephant association. Owner J. D. Rosenberger, whose son was a student at the university, outfitted the undefeated 1926 team with \\"good luck\\" luggage tags for the trip to the 1927 Rose Bowl. The company's trademark, displayed on the tags, was a red elephant standing on a trunk. When the football team arrived in Pasadena, the reporters greeting them, including syndicated columnist Grantland Rice, associated their large size with the elephants on their luggage. When the 1930 team returned to the Rose Bowl, the company furnished leather suitcases, paid for by the Alumni Association, to each team member. Another story dates to 1930. Following the October 4 game against Ole Miss, Atlanta Journal sports writer and Hall of Fame former Georgia Tech back Everett Strupper wrote: > At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant > rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, > 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama > varsity. It was the first time that I had seen it and the size of the entire > eleven nearly knocked me cold, men that I had seen play last year looking > like they had nearly doubled in size. Yet, despite the unofficial status as the Crimson Tide's mascot, the elephant was very much part of the school's football traditions by the 1940s. It was in that decade that a live elephant mascot named \\"Alamite\\" was a regular sight on game days in Tuscaloosa. For several years it was traditional for the pachyderm to lead the homecoming parade and Alamite would also bear that year's queen onto the field prior to the game. Sports writers continued to refer to Alabama as the \\"Red Elephants\\" afterward, referring to their crimson jerseys. The 1930 team shut out eight of ten opponents, allowing a total of only 13 points all season. The \\"Red Elephants\\" rolled up 217 points that season, including a 24-0 victory over Washington State in the Rose Bowl. Despite these early associations of the elephant to the University of Alabama, the university did not officially accept the elephant as university mascot until 1979. Alabama's elephant mascot is known as \\"Big Al\\".  The Million Dollar Band  The Million Dollar Band performing at a football game The Million Dollar Band, the University of Alabama's marching band, was founded in 1912 with 14 members under the direction of Dr. Gustav Wittig. In 1917, the band became a military band and was led by students until 1927. The Million Dollar Band is the largest performing organization on campus, with around 400+ members. The September 1992 issue of Southern Living selected the Million Dollar Band as one of the top ten most outstanding bands in the South. In 2003 it became the twenty-second band to be honored with the Sudler Trophy, given by the Sousa Foundation to recognize \\"collegiate marching bands of particular excellence that have made outstanding contributions to the American way of life.\\" Additionally, the Million Dollar Band has been nationally televised more than any other college marching band in the country. = Naming of the Million Dollar Band = There are two stories to the naming of the Million Dollar Band. The main one is from a time when Alabama's football wasn't doing so well. They were playing Georgia Tech and the coach of Georgia Tech stated, \\"Your football team isn't worth a nickel, but you have a million dollar band.\\" And so the name stuck. In the second story, W. C. \\"Champ\\" Pickens bestowed the name \\"Million Dollar Band\\" after the 1922 football game against Georgia Tech. Though accounts vary, it is reported that in order for the band to attend the game they had to solicit funds from local businesses. They were able to collect enough funds to ride in a tourist sleeper to the game. After the game, which Alabama lost 33-7, an Atlanta sportswriter commented to Pickens, \\"You don't have much of a team; what do you have at Alabama?\\" Pickens replied, \\"A Million Dollar Band.\\" = Directors of the Million Dollar Band = * 1913‚Äì1917: Gustav Wittig * 1917‚Äì1927: Student-led * 1927‚Äì1934: Captain H.

The words are usually credited as, \\"Helen Vickers, 1908\\", although it is not clear whether that was when it was written or if that was her graduating class. The lyrics of the alma mater: Alabama, listen, Mother, To our vows of love, To thyself and to each other, Faithful friends we‚Äôll prove. Faithful, loyal, firm and true, Heart bound to heart will beat. Year by year, the ages through Until in Heaven we meet. College days are swiftly fleeting, Soon we‚Äôll leave their halls Ne‚Äôer to join another meeting ‚ÄòNeath their hallowed walls.

So, farewell, dear Alma Mater May thy name, we pray, Be rev‚Äôrenced ever, pure, and stainless As it is today. Faithful, loyal, firm and true Heart bound to heart will beat Year by year, the ages through Until in Heaven we meet. = \\"Yea Alabama\\" = Following Alabama's 1926 Rose Bowl victory over Washington, a contest was held by The Rammer- Jammer, a student newspaper, for the composition of a fight song. Several entries were submitted to a panel overseen by the Music Department, and the winning entry, \\"Yea Alabama\\",\\"Yea Alabama\\" was adopted. The composer, Ethelred Lundy (Epp) Sykes, a student in the School of Engineering, was the editor of The Rammer-Jammer, and played piano in a jazz ensemble, The Capstone Five. He won the university's Pan-Hellenic Cup in 1926 for overall achievement, both academically, athletically, and in student affairs. The song achieved considerable popularity during the 20s and 30s. Sykes went on to become a brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force, and donated the copyright and future royalties to the university in 1947. The Million Dollar Band plays only the chorus at football games such as after touchdowns and field goals. A Dixieland jazz version of the song appeared on the 1950 Percy Faith album Football Songs (later re-released as Touchdown!) and was played extensively across the state in the 1960s and 1970s as the music bed of radio commercials for sporting goods stores. It was also used as the theme music for The Bear Bryant Show. The last words of the song, \\"Roll Tide!\\", have become the standard cheer, greeting, and farewell among Alabama fans.Davis, Terry (1999). Roll Tide: The Alabama Crimson Tide Story. Creative Education. p. 3 The fight song, as played today, has been shortened to begin with the words \\"Yea Alabama\\"; however, the original version had a verse that went at the beginning. The original version did not have \\"Roll Tide, Roll Tide!\\" at the end, but was added as a chant immediately following the last line of the song. Amusingly, the song refers to several \\"traditional\\" opponents, but two of them are no longer regular opponents. Georgia Tech (\\"Yellow Jackets\\") left the SEC in the early 1960s, and has only infrequently filled one of the non-conference game slots, and The University of the South Tigers (also called Sewanee) withdrew from the SEC in 1940, de-emphasized athletics, and no longer competes at the Division I level. Georgia (\\"Bulldogs\\"), like Alabama, is a member of the SEC, but the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs are in different divisions and play each other only once every six years, unless the schools meet in the SEC Championship Game. This most recently occurred on December 1, 2018, resulting in a University of Alabama victory of 35-28. However, Alabama does still annually play the Mississippi State Bulldogs.  Rammer Jammer Cheer  The \\"Rammer Jammer Cheer\\"\\"Rammer Jammer Cheer\\" is a traditional cheer. The lyrics originate from The Rammer-Jammer, a student magazine in the 1920s, and the yellowhammer, Alabama's state bird. The term yellowhammer was originally used to describe Confederate soldiers from Alabama who wore bright yellow cloth on their uniforms; when the soldiers marched into the city of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, supporters of the Confederacy cheered them with the chant \\"yellowhammer, yellowhammer\\". During and after the American Civil War, the term continued to be used and Alabama became known as the \\"Yellowhammer State\\". The cadence of the cheer was patterned after the Ole Miss cheer \\"Hotty Toddy\\" after then Ole Miss marching band director James Ferguson was appointed director of the Million Dollar Band. The cheer was long referred to as \\"Ole Miss\\", and today the drum major's signal is still the motioning of one arm in a full circle (an \\"O\\"). The cheer was a pregame ritual until the early 2000s, chanting \\"We're gonna' beat the hell out of you!\\", but this was considered unsportsmanlike and banned. The university also briefly forbade the Million Dollar Band from playing it after games, because of its taunting nature. The move was met with a significant amount of criticism. In a vote at Homecoming 2005, the question was posed to students of whether the cheer should be banned. Ninety-eight percent of students voted in favor of keeping the cheer. Before the university's attempt to remove the cheer, it was played before kickoff and at the end of the game. The cheer is now only played in the closing minutes when victory is certain, and is traditionally chanted twice. On at least one occasion (during Alabama's victory over Auburn in the 2008 Iron Bowl, Alabama's first in the series since 2001), it was repeated an additional four times to signify the breaking of the 6-game losing streak to Auburn. After Alabama's victory over the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game, as well as after Alabama's victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 Citi BCS National Championship Game, the cheer was played nine times. Depending on what team Alabama is playing, the Million Dollar Band and fans will call out to the opposing team by chanting the team's mascot with the exception being Auburn University; they do not refer to them as the Tigers, just as Auburn. In other instances, the nickname of the opposing team is substituted; for instance, a victory over the University of Tennessee would change the opening lyrics to \\"Hey Vols!\\" (short for Volunteers, the nickname/mascot for the University of Tennessee) Also, when the cheer was played before kickoff, fans would replace the lyrics \\"We just\\" with \\"We're gonna.\\" The cheer is no longer played before kickoff; however, there are a few special occasions where the cheer is played before a football game. One such instance occurs when Alabama plays Tennessee in Knoxville. The night before the football game, the Alabama Alumni Association hosts a riverboat cruise in which Alabama alumni from all around reunite for a night. During the two trips the riverboat cruise takes over the course of the night, the Million Dollar Band members that are a part of the cruises' pep band will play the Rammer Jammer cheer in the direction of other boats on the river flying a Volunteers' flag. Within the Million Dollar Band, there is taboo around singing the words outside of an actual Crimson Tide victory. When the cheer is played in these situations, members of the band simple play the notes and mime the motions of the cheer without saying any of the words. After losses, opposing fans may sing, ‚ÄúWe just beat the hell out of you! Rammer Jammer, Yellow Hammer, go to Hell Alabama.‚Äù Author Warren St. John titled his 2004 bestseller about obsessive sports fans Rammer Jammer Yellow HammerSt. John, Warren.

There are a total of 7,600 inhabitants living in six villages that form the municipality of Untergruppenbach. Approximately 5,100 live in Untergruppenbach, Donnbronn and Obergruppenbach. An additional 2,500 live in Unterheinriet, Oberheinriet and Vorhof. Untergruppenbach's name roughly means \\"below the 'Groppe' (a sort of small fish) stream\\", referring to a small stream that cuts across the valley in which Untergruppenbach and Obergruppenbach are located. The village is distinguished by Burg Stettenfels, a 16th-century castle/manor that stands out above the valley, from its lofty position atop a hill. History Untergruppenbach is first mentioned in the Monastery of Hirsau, where reference is made to a village settled by the Franconians in the 6th century. It was later named after a small fish, the Groppe or Koppe, which is mentioned as being present in a stream near the settlement. After some 700 years of independent rule, the village was sold to Ludwig II, Duke of Bavaria, from whence the orb in the village's coat of arms probably originates. In 1356 Burg Stettenfels is first mentioned. After a series of wars, in 1504 the castle came into the possession of the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg. Some years later it was sold to Wolff Philipp of Huernheim, who restored it. In 1551 the famous renaissance merchant-banker Fugger family, of Augsburg, came to own the castle. It is under Count Fugger that the castle received its current appearance. Although the area was unaffected by the Thirty Years' War, during which it was an area under Catholic rule, the plague year of 1635 seriously affected the population, with a significant death toll. In the following decades there were tensions between the inhabitants of the village, who were predominantly Protestant, and the village lords, who were Catholic. When Count Xavier Fugger attempted to build a Catholic church and a Capuchin monastery in 1735 the Duke of Wurttemberg intervened and sent troops to destroy the buildings. The tensions continued and apparently reached a breaking point in 1737, when there was a conflict between the villagers and the castle lord, which ended with violence and the death of two men, with several wounded. The Count fled with his son, and in the proceedings that followed they eventually sold their title to the castle to Duke Karl Eugen, and the village came under the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Wurttemberg. From the 17th century up to World War II the population of the municipality hardly changed, maintaining an average of 1,300. Only during the twentieth century did an immigration wave cause notable changes. The structure of the village has changed significantly. Up until the end of the 19th century the inhabitants were mainly farm workers or involved in craft making. In the late 1800s, with better roads, some of the inhabitants began to work in the quarries and factories of the nearby city of Heilbronn, at one point one of the leading paper manufacturers in Germany. In 1971 the villages of Heinriet were added to the municipality of Untergruppenbach. Untergruppenbach Today Although the majority of Untergruppenbach's contemporary residents work in the district of Heilbronn, many are still employed within the municipality or in nearby villages. Viticulture plays a major part in contemporary Untergruppenbach, with the hill upon which Burg Stettenfels stands itself serving as a sloping vineyard. In terms of education, the municipality of Untergruppenbach counts a Hauptschule, two primary schools, two kindergartens, and a Volkshochschule amongst its educational institutions. There are four doctors and two dentists in the municipality, as well as a pharmacy. Amongst the groups represented in the local politics one can find the CDU (Christian Democratic Union), the SPD (German Socialist Party), the Green Party, and the UWG (Independent Voter Community). In the last municipal elections voter turnout was of 58.06%, with the town turning out mainly in favor of the CDU and the independents. The current mayor of Untergruppenbach is Joachim Weller. The municipality shares a strong sense of community, with a large number of leisure and sports associations, as well as a volunteer fire brigade. The municipality has a number of churches, amongst them the 100-year-old Johanneskirche. Protestants and Catholics make up the bulk of the community. The village youth in Untergruppenbach can partake in their own Jugendhaus, or Youth House, a property located in the center of town where they can go to meet and spend time together. For local amusement, Untergruppenbach has a fine municipal swimming pool with heated facilities, as well as the TSV sports center, where any number of physical activities can be practiced, amongst them tennis and soccer. Hikers can find particular enjoyment in the surrounding Swabian-Frankish forest, and activities can be scheduled at the Lutz Siegel Hut, which is located within the forest at a short distance from Burg Stettenfels. The castle has a biergarten located on its foreground, open-air during the summer and enclosed in the colder months. Access to the city of Heilbronn can be achieved easily by autobahn or regular roads. There is regular bus service to and from the city. Nearby villages include Flein, Abstatt, Ilsfeld, Beilstein, L√∂wenstein, Talheim, Brackenheim and Auenstein.

It is owned by the City of Concord and operated by Live Nation. The Pavilion has a capacity of 12,500 people and opened in 1975 as the Concord Pavilion. It is used for concerts, local community events (including an annual jazz festival) and local high school graduations. The Pavilion was designed by architect Frank Gehry and landscape architect Peter Walker. Gehry also designed its mid-1990s renovations, which included more parking and seats. The venue has hosted numerous professional musical acts over the years of its operation and continues to do so to this day. Bing Crosby played his last US concert at the Pavilion. Lawrence Welk's appearance at the Concord Pavilion on June 13, 1982, was billed as his farewell performance. Legendary concert promoter Bill Graham was killed in a 1991 helicopter crash after leaving a concert at the Pavilion by Huey Lewis and the News, having just discussed with the band about organizing a benefit for the victims of that year's fire in the Oakland Hills; Graham's production company, Bill Graham Presents (BGP), had been the booking agent for the Concord Pavilion since at least 1985. In a deal with the city of Concord, Bill Graham Presents took over operations of the facility in February 2000. Shortly thereafter, its name was changed to the Chronicle Pavilion at Concord, following the purchase of the naming rights by the business agent of the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Newspaper Agency. BGP was purchased in 2000, along with its parent, SFX Promotions, by Clear Channel Communications; in 2005, Clear Channel would spin off its concert operations into Live Nation, which operates the Pavilion to this day. The Pavilion changed its name in April 2006, when it became the Sleep Train Pavilion after the California-based mattress retailer (now a Houston, Texas-based company) purchased the naming rights; by 2017 the retailer folded into Mattress Firm . In December 2013, as part of a 10-year contract renewal between Live Nation and the City of Concord, the Pavilion's name was changed again to the Concord Pavilion.

Minor marine layers exist in this thick rock unit (up to ). It is equivalent to the Hampshire Formation of Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia. The Catskill is the largest bedrock unit of the Upper Devonian in northeast Pennsylvania and the Catskill region of New York, from which its name is derived. The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are largely underlain by this unit as well. The rocks of the Catskill are predominantly red sandstone indicating a large scale terrestrial deposition during the Acadian orogeny. Many beds are cyclical in nature, preserving the record of a dynamic environment during its approximately 20 million years of deposition.  Depositional environment  Cut slab of the Catskill Formation from the Coleman Quarry of the Endless Mountain Stone Company, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, showing mud clasts within sandstone Point bar deposits in the Catskill Formation (Devonian) near North Bend, PA. During the Devonian period, the Catskill Delta was formed by a series of river deltas and otherwise marshy terrain. This terrain was sandwiched between the epicontinental Kaskaskia Sea in central North America and the now-vanished Acadian Mountains. Erosion brought sediment from the mountain westwards into the sea, forming the deltas. Eventually the Delta formation was buried and transformed into sandstone, which was then revealed in places when the Catskill and Appalachian Mountains were formed at a later date. This transformation and uncovering is the primary reason why the Catskill Delta is notable in the present; western Pennsylvania's petroleum was formed as a consequence. This was the first major oil region to be developed. The Catskill was once considered to be related to the Old Red Sandstone, but in actuality the two are only coincidentally similar. Both formed at approximately the same time, and under similar conditions: to the north of the Acadian Mountains were the Caledonian Mountains, and a similar region of marsh and river delta formed there.  Glacial Erosion  Though both mountain ranges were formed during the Acadian orogeny, the Catskill Mountains, unlike the Appalachian Mountains underwent glacial erosion. Much of what formed the Catskills as they stand today is a result of the Wisconsin glaciation which ended only about 12,000 years ago. = Signs of Glaciation = There are many signs of the Glacial period event which carved the current day Catskill Mountains. These markers include: * Glacial Erratics such as the Devils Tombstone * Striations * \\"Dance Floors\\" such as Pratt Rock *Terminal moraines  Members  = Eastern Pennsylvania = Towamensing, Walcksville, Beaverdam Run, Long Run, Packerton, Poplar Gap, Sawmill Run, Berry Run, Clarks Ferry, and Duncannon. = Central Pennsylvania = Irish Valley, Sherman Creek, Buddys Run, Clarks Ferry, and Duncannon.

It is an industrial area to the north of the city centre, bounded by Steelhouse Lane, Shadwell Street and Loveday Street. The first recorded gun maker in Birmingham was in 1630, and locally made muskets were used in the English Civil War. By the 1690s Birmingham artisans were supplying guns for William III to equip the British Army. The importance of the trade to the town grew rapidly throughout the 18th century, with large numbers of guns produced for the slave trade. The 19th century saw further expansion, with the Quarter meeting the demand for the Napoleonic Wars, Crimean War, American Civil War and the furthest outposts of the British Empire. During both the First and Second World Wars the area played a major role in the manufacture of small arms for the British Armed Forces. After the First World War demand fell; the need for skilled, specialised labour fell as the market became flooded with cheaper, machine-made guns, and gun manufacturing in the area began a slow decline. In the 1960s, a large part of the Gun Quarter was demolished by post-war town planners, with the area split in two by the construction of the Birmingham Inner Ring Road. Following the Big City Plan of 2008, the Gun Quarter is now a district within Birmingham City Centre. Many buildings in the area are disused but plans are in place for redevelopment including in Shadwell Street and Vesey Street. History =17th century= External view of a cocked 17th century snaphance lock on musket, a weapon Birmingham was selling to London. During the early to mid-17th century Birmingham's population numbered only several thousand; the town was home to many foundries and workshops that made a wide variety of metalware, including guns. Sir Richard Newdigate, one of the new, local Newdigate Baronets, approached manufacturers in the town in 1689 with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms. It was stressed that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January 1693, the \\"Officers of Ordnance\\" chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 \\"snaphance musquets\\" per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to London. =18th century= St Mary's Chapel in Whittall Street was a focal point of the area. It was demolished in 1920s to make room for the expansion of the General Hospital in Steelhouse Lane. At the start of the 18th century, gun manufacture was concentrated in the Digbeth area, but fifty years later the trade had moved to the present-day Gun Quarter. Many of the gunsmiths also expanded to less cramped parts of the city ‚Äì the Gun Quarter is a very small area, and early accounts describe many \\"higgledy piggledy\\" houses and factories with different gunshops and gunsmiths residing in close proximity to one another. A commemorative plaque in the Gun Quarter claims that around this time Birmingham was the \\"foremost arms producer in the world\\", the town's closest rival being London. By the end of the 18th century the Gun Quarter had become a thriving gun-manufacturing community. Government viewing rooms were opened in Bagot Street in 1798, employing sixty or seventy people to ensure that guns produced were of the necessary standard to provide for the British army. Military use, however, was accompanied by a major market in the Atlantic slave trade. A 1788 Parliamentary report counted over 4,000 gun makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave traders. = 19th century = Photograph of the now demolished St. Mary's Row, viewed from Loveday Street. W W Greener, Prize Gun Works is on the right. The British Government began to rely heavily upon the skilled gun manufacturers of the town. The Napoleonic Wars required special efforts, and between 1804 and 1817 a total of 1,827,889 muskets, rifles, carbines, and pistols were manufactured for the Government alone. 3,037,644 barrels and 2,879,203 locks were made and then delivered to London for assembly, and around 1,000,000 items were also delivered to the East India Company, which fought alongside the British forces. It has been estimated that production of guns and components between 1804 and 1815 averaged more than three-quarters of a million items per annum, more than two-thirds of England's production during this period. Birmingham Proof House was built in 1813, then one of only two such proof houses in England, the other being in London. The building was managed by a consortium of the town's gun traders, its purpose being to ensure that the guns manufactured in the area were safe for use. It is still in use. The number of firms in Birmingham's gun industry was 125 in 1815, 455 in 1829 (two-thirds of these in the Gun Quarter), and by 1868 there were 578 gun firms in the city. The trade employed 2,867 people in 1851, out of a total of 7,731 in the whole of England and Wales. \\"Gun-makers\\" did not usually manufacture the parts for their guns or even assemble them: in keeping with the traditional nature of Birmingham's manufacturing industries, parts were manufactured by independent specialist sub-contractors and assembled by \\"fabricators\\" or \\"setters-up\\", the \\"makers\\" commissioning and marketing the completed guns. In the late 18th and early 19th century, barrels were mainly manufactured outside the quarter (in Aston, Deritend, Smethwick and West Bromwich), and locks were mainly sourced from the Black Country, but other parts were usually manufactured and assembled within the Quarter. In the late 19th century, Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham listed more than fifty specialist trades involved in gun manufacture, \\"till late years most of them being carried on under different roofs\\". An 1868 Webley & Scott Revolver. Webley's revolvers became the official sidearms of the British Army in 1887 The Crimean War brought much business to the gun makers of Birmingham, and from 1854 to 1864 more than 4,000,000 barrels were proved there. Most military gun stocks were made from walnut, whereas for the cheaper African market common beech was used. During the Crimean War a large saw mill was erected in Turin by a gun maker from the quarter,W Scott & Co, Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons, Volume 82 page 727J D Goodman, On the progress of the Small Arms Manufacturer September 1865 and nearly a third of a million gun stocks were produced from this source alone. The Birmingham Small Arms Trade Association had supplied many of the guns during this period, and in 1861 fourteen of these gun smiths formed the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA). It is estimated that around 800,000 weapons were shipped from Birmingham to America during the latter's Civil War. One of the main suppliers was William Tranter, who supplied revolvers to the Confederate forces. General Custer is known to have owned a Galand and Sommerville .44 revolver, which was faster to load than existing American pistols. By the nineteenth century, the introduction of the percussion system combined with the adoption of modern production methods led to Birmingham becoming the dominant producer in British firearms. A few London makers remained, such as the government-owned Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield but Birmingham produced the majority of the firearms in Britain. During this time the Gun Quarter made a variety of calibre weapons from high quality to the less elaborate. In general, British weapons were well made, but less decorative than those produced on the continent; above all they earned a reputation for reliability and fine craftsmanship. =20th century= The outbreak of World War I saw the Government once again approach Birmingham engineering companies with the prospect of arms manufacture, and within a matter of weeks Birmingham and the Gun Quarter witnessed much preparation for ammunition and gun manufacture. Many of the workers were women due to the enlistment of men into the armed forces. The increasing mechanisation of gun manufacture in the US and Europe was a significant step in the decline of the Birmingham gun trade, which had for centuries been based on the skilled specialist craftsman. The mass- produced, so-called 'ready made' guns began to flood the market in the 1880s; the number of Brummies employed by the trade fell from 5,500 in 1881 to 4,100 in 1911. The trade continued to contract from this point onwards, despite the massive increase in demand during two World Wars, demand fell through the floor as soon as hostilities ceased. This along with the failure of many established firms to adapt to modern technical advances in machine manufacturing meant that they failed to maintain competitiveness in a challenging market. In the 1960s, many of the traditional workshops of the Gun Quarter were demolished by post-war town planners, with the area split in two by the construction of the Birmingham Inner Ring Road. In 1963, a local newspaper, the Sunday Mercury announced the 'Death of Gun Quarter'. Modern times Grange Road, Bournbrook with the works of Westley Richards and Co. Ltd Today only a small handful of gun manufacturers and traders remain in the Gun Quarter. The last remaining large gun and rifle manufacturer in the area is Westley Richards. Due to the UK's severely restrictive laws regarding gun ownership, including sporting arms, there is only a small commercial market for firearms in the United Kingdom; consequently, the majority of Birmingham's gun manufacture today is for the air gun sports trade. The Gun Quarter has continued to decline in the 21st century, losing approximately 25% of its manufacturing jobs in the 3 years from 2003 to 2006, and the trend is continuing, with many vacant and underused buildings. In August 2011 a controversy was created when the Birmingham Council, in an unwelcome move, decided to change the name of the Gun Quarter. The Council had received a petition from a mere 50 residents from a local church group to change the name to St George and St Chad's Quarter. The Birmingham Post reported on in response over 4,500 signed a petition not to change the name.  Gunmakers  Hundreds of gunmakers have existed in Birmingham; some of the better-known examples include: * Joseph Bentley ‚Äì shared patents with Webley & Scott * Thomas Bland & Sons ‚Äì now trading in the USA but still using Birmingham proof for quality assurance * Braendlin and Sommerville ‚Äì eventually Galand and Sommerville * A A Brown & Sons ‚Äì Founded by Albert Arthur Brown who was the son of John Joseph Brown, a gunmaker who had at one time worked for Webley & Scott, Birmingham Small Arms and W. W. Greener and who ended his working career as resident caretaker with Greener. He founded the firm with his two sons, Albert Henry Brown and Sidney Charles Brown. The company are still trading, with the firm now run by Sidney's son Robin Brown and his son Matthew Brown. * Thomas Chambers ‚Äì originally of Bristol, manufactured in Birmingham from 1753 to 1757 at which point he moved to London * Farmer and Galton ‚Äì supplied weaponry to the Company of Merchants in Africa as well as the East India Company. * W. W. Greener ‚Äì Owned the large Prize Gun Works in Loveday street. The firm are still trading today, making exhibition guns for collectors by David Dryhurst (Greener's last apprentice) and Richard Tandy. * Thomas Ketland ‚Äì established in the early 18th century and became one of the largest businesses in the gun quarter * The Kynoch Gun Factory * Parker Hale ‚Äì closed down in 2000 * William Perry ‚Äì established in 1778, manufactured brass and silver guns, often marking them with a London tag * Westley Richards ‚Äì producers of the famous British Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles * E. Roberts ‚Äì specialised in walking stick shotguns * William Tranter ‚Äì founding partner in BSA * Webley & Scott ‚Äì pistol and airgun manufacturers = Farmer and Galton Gun Manufacturer = During the eighteenth century, the Birmingham-based Farmer and Galton Gun Manufacturers produced thousands of firearms which were used by European merchants and African tribes in the trade and capture of slaves. In 1702, James Farmer began his gun manufacturing business, and within three decades had secured the investments of Samuel Galton senior (grandfather of Sir Francis Galton).W.A. Richards, 'The Birmingham Gun Manufactory of Farmer and Galton, and the Slave Trade in the Eighteenth Century' (unpublished Undergraduate, University of Birmingham, 1972), p. 3. Galton eventually took charge of the Birmingham branch of the manufacturers on Steelhouse Lane. Guns were in high demand, a demand that Farmer and Galton aimed to satisfy. Such was the extent of the trade, that Hugh Thomas suggests that by 1765, '150,000 guns had been sent to Africa from Birmingham alone', being traded along with other pieces of hardware, metal or cloth, as the price for a slave.Hugh Thomas, The slave trade: The history of the Atlantic slave trade, 1440‚Äì1870 (London: Picador, UK, 1997), p. 45. This is an impressive statistic, considering that the population of Birmingham was around 30,000 in 1765, meaning that five times more guns had been sent to Africa than were people in the city. The origins, growth and sales organisation of Farmer and Galton were shaped by the slave trade. Between 1742 and 1760, the firm manufactured the largest part of its output for export; the period immediately before Britain‚Äôs Industrial Revolution.Eric Hopkins, Birmingham: The First Manufacturing Town in the World 1760‚Äì1840 (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989). In the 1750s, they were the chief supplier of arms to the Committee of the Company of Merchants Trading in Africa, enabling the firm to grow rapidly, making it one of the biggest and most successful businesses in Birmingham.

V√•lerenga church stands in the middle of V√•lerenga park in the neighborhood of V√•lerenga. The church belongs to the parish of V√•lerenga of the Oslo arch-deanery within the Diocese of Oslo of the Church of Norway. History V√•lerenga Church The church was built in late 19th century, and was consecrated in 1902. The architects were Heinrich J√ºrgensen and Holger Sinding-Larsen. The church is built in the Neo-Gothic and National Romantic styles, like many of the Norwegian churches built during this period of time. V√•lerenga church is special architecturally because of its asymmetrically placed church tower, one of Norway's first of its kind. In 1979, the church burned to the ground during construction work and the building was almost totally destroyed. Only the outer walls, made of stone, were left standing. Frescoes and stained glass windows made by Emanuel Vigeland were lost. The church was rebuilt, and reconsecrated in 1984. New pieces of art were made by the artist H√•kon Bleken together with a fresco which had been designed by Emanuel Vigeland. Former priests have included Einar Gelius. In popular culture The fire at the church is the topic of a song named V√•lerenga Kjerke, composed by Trond Ingebretsen and recorded by his band Bj√∏lsen Valsem√∏lle.

He played for the Seattle Mariners, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals. He bats and throws left-handed. Early years Fuentes was born in Merced, California and attended Merced High School. After graduating from high school, Fuentes attended Merced Community College. Professional career =Seattle Mariners= Fuentes was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 25th round of the 1995 MLB draft. He spent one season for the Mariners appearing in ten games. =Colorado Rockies= On December 16, 2001, Fuentes was traded to the Colorado Rockies, along with Jos√© Paniagua and Denny Stark for Jeff Cirillo. Through the first four years of his Major League career, Fuentes had a record of 8-8 with a 4.04 ERA, recording only four saves in 163 games. However, in 2005, Fuentes took over the closer role for the Rockies following the season- ending shoulder surgery of right-handed pitcher Chin-hui Tsao. Fuentes had a successful season and was named to his first career All-Star Game, but did not appear in the game. He became the first reliever and only the third pitcher overall to represent the Rockies, joining starting pitchers Mike Hampton () and Shawn Chac√≥n (). His 31 saves matched Dave Veres () for the third highest single season total in franchise history, trailing only Jos√© Jim√©nez (41 in 2002) and Chacon (35 in 2004). In 2006, Fuentes earned 30 saves while posting a 3-4 record and a 3.44 ERA and was selected as an All-Star for the second time. Fuentes got his first career postseason win in Game 3 of the 2007 NLDS when the Rockies won the series against the Phillies in 3 games. The Rockies would eventually make it to the World Series for the first time in franchise history but lost to the Boston Red Sox in the 2007 World Series in just 4 games. In June 2007, after blowing four saves within an eight-day period, Fuentes was demoted from his role as Rockies closer, losing the job to Manny Corpas. Despite his struggles, he was named an NL All-Star later that week for the third straight year. In April 2008, Fuentes regained his closer role, after Corpas had blown a number of save opportunities. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= Fuentes pitching for the Angels On December 31, 2008, Fuentes agreed to a two-year deal with the Angels to fill in the position as closer after Francisco Rodr√≠guez left for the Mets. On July 5, 2009, Fuentes was elected to represent Anaheim in the 2009 All Star Game, at the time leading the majors in saves. Fuentes led the major leagues in saves with 48 in 2009, despite a 3.93 ERA and 1.40 WHIP. His strikeout to walk ratio decreased from a 3.73 rate with the 2008 Colorado Rockies to a much more modest 1.92 in 2009. His difficulties led manager Mike Scoscia to call in young reliever Kevin Jepsen to close at certain times. =Minnesota Twins= On August 27, 2010, Fuentes was traded to the Minnesota Twins for a player to be named later. While Fuentes had been a closer with the Angels, he was expected to be a set- up man with the Twins. Nevertheless, Fuentes earned a save in his first outing with the Twins, a 1-0 win over the Seattle Mariners. =Oakland Athletics= On January 16, 2011, Fuentes reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with the Oakland Athletics. The A's Manager Bob Geren demoted him from the closing role once again in May 2011, reportedly due to performance issues. In the same general timeframe, Fuentes made public statements critical Geren's management, as did former A's reliever Huston Street. Fuentes was designated for assignment on July 3, 2012 to clear a roster spot for returning pitcher Bartolo Col√≥n. Fuentes was released from the Oakland Athletics on July 11, 2012. =St. Louis Cardinals= Fuentes signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals on July 14, 2012. On July 25, 2012, Fuentes's contract was purchased from AA-Springfield. He replaced Victor Marte, who was optioned to Triple-A Memphis that same day.Eager to contribute, Fuentes called up to Cards, MLB.com (July 25, 2012) On August 14, 2012, Fuentes was placed on the Cardinals' restricted list after requesting time off for undisclosed personal reasons. He did not return during the 2012 season. =Retirement= On November 14, 2012 Fuentes told the Merced Sun-Star that he was retiring after twelve seasons in the Major Leagues. Said Fuentes: \\"Ultimately, I was just having trouble with the time away from my family. I've been playing baseball for all of their lives, but I'd never been so far away as when I was in St. Louis.\\" Fuentes finished his career with an overall record of 26 wins, 43 losses and a career ERA of 3.62 with 204 saves. He was a four-time All-Star. Pitching style Fuentes' pitching delivery was a unique and sometimes confusing one, especially for left-handed hitters. He pitched sidearm, which was difficult for hitters to pick up and kept them off balance. Many batters, mainly left-handers, said the ball appeared to be coming out of the sleeve of his jersey. His fastball usually clocked between 89‚Äì92 miles per hour. Personal life Brian Fuentes has a wife (Barbara), his oldest son Giovanni, two fraternal twins, Benicio and Gabriella, and their youngest child Farrah. Fuentes currently makes his offseason home in Merced, California. Fuentes comes from a Mexican American family.

History The Berkeley Neuroscience Center (BNC) was created in 1997 under the leadership of Professors Carla Shatz and Corey Goodman, who served as the first two Directors from 1997-2001. Neuroscience professors in departments across campus were invited to become faculty in the Center to help recruit new core faculty and to accept graduate students into their labs for training. A $10 million bequest from Olympic gold medalist and 8-time Wimbledon champion Helen Wills Moody endowed the graduate program and provided cash support to grow the Center. On July 1, 2000, it was formally renamed the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI) in honor of this bequest. The Neuroscience PhD Program accepted its first class in Fall 2001. At any time there are approximately 60 graduate students in the department. The institute now encompasses over 70 research faculty from many departments including: Molecular & Cellular Biology, Psychology, Integrative Biology, Vision Science, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Physics, and Environmental Science, Policy & Management, Haas School of Business, College of Chemistry, School of Public Health, Department of Bioengineering.

Data are analyzed at the Judy & John Webb Neuroimaging Computational Facility also housed on the Berkeley campus. =Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience= The Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience became a part of the HWNI on July 1, 2005 after the dissolution of the nonprofit scientific research facility, the Redwood Neuroscience Institute (RNI), once housed in Menlo Park, California. The RNI was established by Jeff Hawkins in August, 2002. Many of the researchers from the RNI joined the University as faculty or staff, and the institute was renamed the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. Through the use of various electro- and magnetophysiological techniques, this group hopes to discover an underlying biological mathematics model of memory and cognition = Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences = The Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences (ICBS) became part of the HWNI in September 2009. The ICBS supports research exploring the study of the mind and the biological basis of behavior and mental function. Founded as the Institute for Cognitive Studies in 1984, ICBS adopted its current name in 2000 in recognition of the emergence of cognitive neuroscience as a field for the bi-directional study of mind- brain relationships. = Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses = CNEP, led by co-directors Jose Carmena (UCB) and Edward Chang (UCSF) brings together neuroscientists, neurologists, and engineers from UC Berkeley and UCSF to develop breakthrough technologies to restore neural function.

This was also the first case to use the framework proposed by Law v. Canada.  Background  Members of the Batchewana Indian Band, on behalf of themselves and all other non-resident members of the band, sought a declaration that section 77(1) of the Indian Act violates section 15(1) of the Charter. The section of the Indian Act states that only band members \\"ordinary resident\\" on the reserve be permitted in order to vote in the band elections even though only one third of the registered members live on the reserve.  Court's ruling  The court unanimously agreed with the Court of Appeal's ruling that the Act violated section 15(1) of the Charter. However, the Court was split 5 to 4 on the proper application of the test. The majority opinion was written by McLachlin and Bastarache JJ. with Lamer C.J., Major, and Cory JJ. concurring. The Court found that an analogous ground upon which a section 15 claim can be based must be immutable, either actually immutable, such as race, or constructively immutable such as religion.

A project was presented in 2011 to open for tender on the system, giving it new cabins and restore infrastructure. The service was expected to be back in 2012, however the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning received only one offer that was rejected, so the tender was ended and a new public contest was announced, that began in 2013. Then, in December 2014 it was announced that the cable car would re-open in the second semester of 2016 after a series of maintentenance and remodeling works to be done from March 2015, costing US$9,5 million. These works complete the installation of the new 46 cabin network, of which 8 will be enabled for the transport of bicycles, strollers or wheelchairs. The transport cabins have a 6-person capacity and the system was reopened on November 2016. From the top of the hill are two pools ‚Äì Tupahue and Antil√©n, and access the National Zoo of Chile at the Bellavista entrance to Cerro San Crist√≥bal. The Children‚Äôs Park of Cerro San Crist√≥bal also provides entrance to the hill via Avenida Per√∫.Casi 16 mil personas han visitado el Parque de la Infancia del cerro San Crist√≥bal a dos semanas de su apertura.

This optical illusion is known under different names: Ring-Segment illusion, Jastrow illusion, Wundt area illusion or Wundt- Jastrow illusion. The illusion also occurs in the real world. In the illustration on the right, the two toy railway tracks are identical, although the lower one appears to be larger. There are three competing theories on how this illusion occurs. This illusion is often included in magic kits and several versions are sold in magic shops and is commonly known under the name Boomerang Illusion. Origin The World of Wonders. The oldest reference to this illusion can be found in The World of Wonders, an 1873 book about curiosities of nature, science and art. The two arches are placed on top of each other. They are similar in size, but not the same. The inner radius of the upper arch is the same as the outer radius of the lower arch. The first psychologist to describe this illusion was German psychologist Franz M√ºller- Lyer in 1889. His article presents a collection of geometrical illusions of size, including what is now known as the M√ºller-Lyer illusion. His paper also includes the ring segments which we now know as the Jastrow Illusion. Wundt Area Illusion. Joseph Jastrow extensively researched optical illusions, the most prominent of them being the rabbit‚Äìduck illusion, an image that can be interpreted as being both a rabbit or a duck. In 1892 he published a paper which introduced his version of what is now known as the Jastrow illusion. His version is different to the commonly used figure because the two arches taper to one end. Jastrow Illusion. On the other side of the Atlantic, German scientist Wilhelm Wundt was also pioneering in psychology research. He wrote one of the first books about geometric optical illusions in which he copied the design previously published by M√ºller-Lyer.  Cause  There are several competing explanations of why the brain perceives the difference in size between the ring segments, none of which has been accepted as definitive. One explanation relates to how the mind interprets the two-dimensional images on the retina as a three-dimensional world. Another explanation relates to the fact that the mind can only attend to a small field of vision, which is reconstructed by our consciousness. The most commonly used explanation is that the brain is confused by the difference in size between the large and the small radius. The short side makes the long side appear longer, and the long side makes the short side appear even shorter.  Similarity to other optical illusions  The Jastrow illusion has been compared with other optical illusions, such as the Fat Face illusion, the Leaning Tower illusion and the Ponzo illusion. Masaki Tomonaga, a researcher at Kyoto University, compared the Jastrow Illusion with the so-called Fat Face Illusion. He conducted experiments with people and chimpanzees to compare this illusion with the classical Jastrow Illusion. Animals are known to observe many of the same optical illusions as humans do, but this was the first study to demonstrate that the Jastrow illusion is also experienced by chimpanzees. The Fat Face illusion happens when two identical images of the same face are aligned vertically, the face at the bottom appears fatter. The effect is much smaller than the Jastrow Illusion, with a size difference of only four percent. The experiment showed that both humans and chimpanzees were fooled by the Jastrow Illusion. As a comparison, none of the subjects picked the wrong rectangle. Human subjects showed a strong Fat Face illusion, but chimpanzees did not perceive the top face as being thinner.  Perception research  Japanese psychologist Shogu Imai experimented with different versions of the Wundt Illusion in 1960 to find out which combination of measurements creates the strongest illusion. He varied the inner and outer radius, the opening angle of the segment, and the angle of the ends. He also looked at whether the distance between the two shapes, or whether they are horizontally or vertically influences the strength of the illusion. Imai showed different versions of the illusion to a group of people and asked them to rate the perceived difference in size. Imai found that the maximum reported difference was about ten percent. He also found that the inner radius should be 60% of the outer radius to achieve the maximum effect. The ideal opening angle was found to be 80 degrees. The cut angle is most effective at zero degrees, which occurs when the line extends through the centre of the circle segments. He also found that the illusion is strongest when the segments are horizontal and that the ideal distance is just above each other. Overlapping the segments or moving them too far apart destroys the illusion. Manfredo Massironi and his colleagues from the universities of Rome and Verona modified the Jastrow illusion to develop a diagnostic test for unilateral spatial neglect. People that suffer from neglect do not experience the illusion when the overlapping part of the segments is on the side where their perception is missing. When the segments are reversed, they perceive the illusion in the same way as people that do not suffer from neglect. Researchers have also examined the susceptibility of people with autism to a range of optical illusions. This research seems to indicate that people with autism don't experience visual size illusions. This finding is consistent with the idea that autism involves an excessive focus on details. These findings have recently been contradicted. Recent research, which included the Jastrow illusion, placed these findings in doubt. The Jastrow illusion has been used to see whether young children are deceived by geometric optical illusions. Researchers used ring segments that were not equal in size so they could simulate both illusionary and real size differences. The showed the two segments in three configurations. The smaller shaded smaller segment was placed on top to emphasise the difference in size. In the other positions, the smaller piece was placed below or above the larger piece to create the illusion it is bigger. The children were asked to play a game called \\"Big and Little\\" and point out which segment was really bigger than the other. In a second version of the test the kids were asked to point out which one looks bigger. The results show that children from the age of five are capable of distinguishing between real differences in size and an apparent difference.

The royal prerogative of mercy was originally used to permit the monarch to withdraw, or provide alternatives to death sentences; the alternative of penal transportation to \\"partes abroade\\" was used since at least 1617.Acts of the Privy Council of England, Colonial Series, Vol. I, 1613-1680, p.12. (1908) It is now used to change any sentence or penalty. A royal pardon does not itself overturn a conviction. Officially, this is a power of the monarch. Formally, in Commonwealth realms, this has been delegated to the governor-general of the realm, which in practice means to government ministers who advise the monarch or viceroy, usually those responsible for justice. Specifically, it has been delegated to the Lord Chancellor in England and Wales, the Scottish Ministers in Scotland, and the federal and provincial cabinets in Canada, in respect of federal and provincial offences. In the important case of Derek Bentley, a court found that this royal prerogative power is \\"probably\\" entirely a matter of policy, and thus not justiciable.  Examples in Britain  In 2001 two inmates at HMP Prescoed, South Wales, received early release under the prerogative of mercy as a reward for saving the life of the manager of the prison farm when he was attacked and gored by a captive wild boar. In 2013 a posthumous pardon was awarded to Alan Turing under the prerogative of mercy. Wartime codebreaker Turing had been convicted in 1952 of gross indecency for a consensual homosexual relationship with an adult. In 2020, Steven Gallant is to be considered for release on parole from his imprisonment for murder ten months early, under the prerogative of mercy \\"in recognition of his exceptionally brave actions at Fishmongers‚Äô Hall, which helped save people‚Äôs lives despite the tremendous risk to his own\\" while confronting terrorist Usman Khan during the 2019 London Bridge attack.  In other Commonwealth realms  =Australia= In Australia, the Governor-General acts on the advice of the Attorney-General or Minister for Justice, and may only exercise the prerogative of mercy in relation to a federal offender convicted of a Commonwealth offence. The pardon may be a full pardon (said to be a free, absolute and unconditional pardon), a conditional pardon, a remission or partial remission of a penalty, or the ordering of an inquiry. Each state and territory (apart from the Australian Capital Territory, which only provides for an inquiry) has also enacted legislation providing for the reconsideration of convictions or sentences. =Canada= In Canada the royal prerogative of mercy is established in Letters Patent of the Governor General, who consistent with constitutional convention may grant pardons on the advice of a cabinet minister. In practice, Section 748 of the Criminal Code gives the Governor in Council (i.e. cabinet) to power to exercise the prerogative, which is the preferred approach. The process is administered by the Parole Board of Canada. As Canada has a record suspension process, the royal prerogative is only exercised in where there is substantial injustice or undue hardship.<ref name=\\"PBCclem /> It is rarely granted: between fiscal years 2013-2014 and 2017-2018 there were only 2 requests for clemency under the prerogative granted, compared to over 9,000 record suspensions or pardons granted under legislative powers in fiscal year 2017-2018 alone. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the prerogative of mercy is exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, with the power being delegated by the Letters Patent 1983. The Governor-General will act on the advice of the Minister of Justice, and has the power to grant a pardon, refer a case back to the courts for reconsideration, and to reduce a person's sentence.

Sundiata Keita's forces roundly defeated those of Sumanguru Kant√©, guaranteeing the pre-eminence of Keita's new Mali Empire over Africa.  Prelude  By the late twelfth century, the formerly dominant Ghana Empire had collapsed, following internal strife and political intervention of the Almoravids in the eleventh century. A number of smaller neighboring states rushed to fill the power void, including the Sosso people of the Kaniaga kingdom, and the Mandinka people of the Upper Niger. Under the leadership of Soumaro Kant√©, the Sosso seized Koumbi Saleh, former capital of the Ghana Empire, and expanded outward, conquering the Mandinka among others.  During the Battle  The exiled Mandinka prince Sundiata Keita organized a coalition of smaller kingdoms to oppose the growing power of the Sosso. The opposing armies met in the Koulikoro Region of what is now Mali in about 1235. Sundiata Keita's forces were victorious, and marched on to raze Sosso. The date is often cited as the beginning of the Mali Empire, which would control most of West Africa for the next two centuries.  Aftermath  The story of the battle is retold in the Epic of Sundiata, widely considered Mali's national epic. In it, Sumanguru Kant√© is an evil sorcerer-king who oppresses the Mandinka people; however, when Sundiata discovers that his sacred animal is the rooster, he is able to wound Sumanguru Kant√© with an arrow tipped by a cock's spur. The Sosso king then flees the field, disappearing into the Koulikoro mountains. A version of this story was recounted by Maximilien Quenum in his L√©gendes africaines.

The character is noted for her storylines including bullying and self-harming. After her exit from Hollyoaks, Atkinson reprised the role twice in two spin-off series. Development =Casting= Actress Gemma Atkinson was cast in the role of Lisa, a member of the new Hunter family, in 2001. During 2004, Atkinson was reported to have been axed from the soap along with her on-screen family. Despite this, the character stayed onscreen until 2005, before making further appearances in spin-offs Hollyoaks: Let Loose and Hollyoaks: In the City. Reports of the character's return arose in 2007, with Atkinson supposedly signing a ¬£100,000 a year deal with the show. This was eventually denied by a spokeswoman for the show, who told Digital Spy:\\"There are no current plans for Gemma Atkinson to return to Hollyoaks in the foreseeable future.\\" Hollyoaks series producer at that time, Bryan Kirkwood, also commented on the speculation of her return: \\"Gemma's a real star and I have chatted with her and her agent about the possibility of a future return. None of us feels that it's right at the moment but there's a chance it could happen in the future. There's nothing signed and nothing planned for the foreseeable future.\\" In 2010, Atkinson announced she desired to return to the soap for a guest stint, she said: \\"I've not been asked to, but I'd love to go back for a few episodes. In the show, one brother has died, my sister is in France and the older brother is now in Emmerdale, so I don't know how they would introduce Lisa back.\\" However, several weeks after Atkinson's statement, it was announced that Alex Carter, who played Lisa's brother Lee, would return to the show later in 2010.

It'd be good to see Lisa, wouldn't it?\\" The serial offered her a 12-month contract for her return, but she turned it down because she didn't want to become \\"stuck in a rut\\". =Spin-offs= After her departure from the Hollyoaks show, Atkinson and Marcus Patric (Ben Davies) signed to appear in spin-off Hollyoaks: Let Loose, which saw the characters moving on with their lives following their departures from Hollyoaks village. The series received poor viewing figures and another series was not produced. In 2006, details of a follow-up spin-off, Hollyoaks: In the City, were announced. Several other characters were cast from actors including Philip Olivier, Leon Lopez, Oliver Lee and Kym Marsh. The series, which followed Ben and Lisa to Liverpool, was aired on Channel 4 sister channel E4 during August to December 2006. Despite fair ratings, the series was axed by E4 in December 2006. However, the character of Lisa was left open for a possible return. Storylines Lisa becomes popular at school, much to the dislike of jealous Steph Dean (Carley Stenson), who then begins to bully her. Sick of the bullying and after some family problems, Lisa turns to self- harming. Lisa keeps her secret from everyone until Brian Drake finds the cuts on her arms and legs and assumes she is being abused and calls a social worker. Lisa then admits to self harming. She beings to see a counsellor and her life slowly returns to normal. Lisa begins a relationship with Brian, however she becomes rather reliant on his help when family troubles get her down. The pair split up just before their exams start. Cameron Clark arrives and immediately takes a shine to Lisa. Eventually the pair start a relationship. Lisa starts to get threatening text messages from a mysterious stalker. Her friends assume it is Steph due to the bullying and her jealousy over Lisa's relationship with Cameron. Lisa's stalker is revealed to be her jealous ex-boyfriend Brian, who blames her for his exam failure. Cameron and Lisa lose their virginity to each other, but break up. Lisa briefly dates Kristian Hargreaves (Max Brown), however it does not last, while there was more bad news for Lisa, as her older brother Lee (Alex Carter) was getting in trouble with the police and started failed exams, while her sister Ellie (Sarah Baxendale) disappears in Ibiza for almost two years, but returns to the village. Meanwhile, Steph resumes her relentless bullying of Lisa after discovering that her brother-in-law, serial killer Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg), was responsible for an attack that nearly cost Steph her life and left her with epilepsy, which pushes Lisa closer to the edge once again. However, after Steph unleashes a cruel and vicious physical attack on a tearful Lisa outside the Drive 'n' Buy, Steph's father Johnno Dean (Colin Wells) comes to the rescue. After pulling Steph off her victim, Johnno publicly reprimands Steph for her behaviour and orders her to leave Lisa alone. The two reconcile later on, and Steph apologises to Lisa for her constant bullying. After the death of her brother Dan (Andrew McNair), Lisa becomes more confident and is determined to enjoy life to the fullest. She begins to go off the rails and has an affair with Dan's friend, Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre), which ends up with him contracting an STD. Lisa decides she wants to be with Jake, however he tells her he loves his girlfriend Becca Dean (Ali Bastian). Jake confesses his affair to Becca, who then ends her friendship with Lisa. Lisa then turns her affections to Ben Davies (Marcus Patric), which angers his girlfriend Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Ben leaves Louise for Lisa and the pair decide to leave the village together. After their departure from Hollyoaks, Ben and Lisa start a new life. Cracks begin to show in the relationship as Ben cheats and Lisa ends up self-harming again. Lisa plans to move to Cyprus, leaving Ben, however he stops her and convinces her to give their relationship another chance. In Hollyoaks: In the City, Ben and Lisa return from a holiday to Liverpool, where Lisa begins working as a receptionist and a model. Ben attempts to buy a bar but is ripped off by a con man losing all his savings, the pair move in with his friend Tank-Top and his flatmate Adam. Ben gets a job with shady local entrepreneur Burton Phillips.Yet again Lisa and Ben's relationship struggles as they both cheat. Lisa is kidnapped by her new boss Stella to be used in a snuff film as Ben races to save her, however, Stella's conscience gets the better of her and she frees Lisa, who, during a scuffle, takes one of Stella's henchman's guns whilst trying to escape, Ben bursts into the room and Lisa accidentally shoots him, killing him. As the police arrive and arrest Stella and her gang, Lisa cradles Ben's body in her arms as Tank-Top and Burton look on. Reception In 2002, Gemma Atkinson was nominated for Best Actress, Sexiest Female and Best Newcomer at the British Soap Awards for her portrayal of Lisa. Atkinson was again nominated for 'Best Actress' in the 2003 awards and also for the award of Best Dramatic Performance From a Young Actor or Actress in the 2004 British Soap Awards. Virgin Media profiled some of Hollyoaks' \\"hottest females\\" in their opinion, of Lisa they stated: \\"Lisa Hunter transformed from a bullied teenager into the ultimate sexpot overnight. With two steamy affairs under her belt, Lisa eventually left the village with Ben Davies ‚Äì we bet [Atkinson's then-boyfriend] Ronaldo was mega jeals!\\" They have also described Lisa as having an \\"intense personality\\" and credit \\"her parents' tumultuous relationship, a missing sister, her affair with an engaged man and her self- harming\\" have caused Lisa to have an extremely troubled life.

Her successful songs were \\"Down and Counting\\", \\"Boogie Woogie Dancin' Shoes\\" and others. As an actress, she is known for performing in the European versions of stage musicals AC/DC and Catch My Soul. Early music career At the age of six, Barry and her family emigrated from Jamaica to Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. After graduation from high school, Barry left for London where she eventually landed a role in the musical AC/DC by Heathcote Williams and after that in a German production of Catch My Soul. The play toured Europe where she eventually wound up in West Germany in the spring of 1975. That same year she signed with Hot Foot label and released a single called \\"Reggae Bump\\". It was released in Canada under the Hansa label. Barry had some success with her recordings. She had two Billboard Hot 100 entries, the first being \\"Dancin' Fever\\" which peaked at No. 72, off The Girl Most Likely album, the other song being \\"Boogie Woogie Dancin' Shoes\\" (R&B; No. 37, Pop No. 56 in 1979) from the album I Wanna Be Loved By You, released in 1978. Both became major mainstream pop hits in Canada (where \\"Dancin' Shoes\\" peaked at No. 7 on the RPM 100 national chart on 7 April 1979 and remained on the chart for 23 weeks) as well as in Europe. All her studio albums were produced in Germany by J√ºrgen Korduletsch. In 1976, the soulful ballad, \\"Love for the Sake of Love\\", received airplay and in 1979, the single, \\"Boogie Tonight\\", from the I Wanna... album, received Canadian airplay, sharing the charts with \\"Dancin' Shoes\\" and reaching No. 42 on 23 June 1979. Also in 1979, she won a Juno Award for being the Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year. The 1980s With the release of her Feel The Fire album in 1980, Claudja's songs were becoming highly synthesized ‚Äì this was her final album to feature an earthier, more horn & string approach to the production of her music. In 1981, she made a successful foray into new wave/Hi-NRG music with the album Made in Hong Kong. It featured the lead single \\"Radio Action\\", which became a moderate club hit peaking at No. 57. In 1985, she appeared in the movie, Rappin, starring Mario Van Peebles. The year 1985 also saw the release of the single, \\"Born To Love\\" which sounds similar to a Pet Shop Boys or Erasure song. This single was produced by J√ºrgen Korduletsch with New York City based Hi-NRG producer, singer, and songwriter, Bobby Orlando. \\"Born To Love\\" peaked at No. 14 on Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Dance format radio stations in the United States did not give it major exposure since the album it was lifted from was a UK- only release. On the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, she has had much more success: six Top 10 hits, including \\"Down and Counting\\", which spent a week at No. 1 in 1986. At the time, the song also became only her third single to chart outside of the Billboard Club Songs chart in the U.S., peaking at a No. 98 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Barry had further successes on that chart with the singles \\"Can't You Feel My Heartbeat\\" (No. 33 R&B;) and \\"Secret Affair\\" (No. 60 R&B;). \\"Down and Counting\\" was the lead single from her album, I, Claudja, her only full-length record for Epic Records. The 1990s After her run at Epic did not result in another album, she focused her music career on her fans in Canada and abroad. She still remained active recording a pair of underground club classics during the early 1990s. The singles \\"Love Is An Island\\" (1991) and \\"Summer of Love\\" (1992) are highly regarded club hits to those who know them. She covered a Prince song called \\"When 2 R in Love\\" in 1992 on Radikal Records. In 1993, the German euro-dance project General Base featured Barry as lead singer for their single \\"Poison\\", which got a greater success. \\"Summer of Love\\" was successful enough that it maintains radio airplay on some radio stations such as WMPH. Both singles became major hits outside of the U.S. A Christmas/Holiday Dance album titled, Disco'round The Christmas Tree was released on Radikal Records in 1995, then an extended mix compilation titled, Disco Mixes. Before the decade ended, she recorded another song called, \\"Reach Out For Me\\" on Tony Green Organization Records in 1997. 1999 to present In 1999, R&B; artist Montell Jordan sampled the rhythm track from Barry's single \\"Love For the Sake of Love,\\" for the hit titled, \\"Get It On Tonite\\" (No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 ). In the year 2000, Da Brat also released a song with the same sample featuring Tyrese called \\"What'chu like\\" which reached number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. In May 2006, Barry returned to the Billboard charts with \\"I Will Stand\\" released on Donna Jean Records. By July the song had reached the Top 10 of the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, peaking at No. 4 before the end of the summer. It received moderate dance radio format airplay. In 2015, Barry's eighth album titled \\"Come On Standup\\" was released as a digital download only album release through CDBaby.

She was one of a trio of women composers who dominated Western Canadian music in the twentieth century: Coulthard, Barbara Pentland, and Violet Archer. All three died within weeks of each other in 2000. Her own work might be loosely termed \\"prematurely neo-Romantic\\", as the orthodox serialists who dominated academic musical life in North America during the 1950s and 1960s had little use for her. Some of her well-known compositions include Cradle Song, Threnody, Canadian Fantasy, Ballade \\"A Winter's Tale\\" and her opera Return of the Native. Life and career Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Coulthard was the daughter of Jean Blake Robinson Coulthard, a prominent and influential music teacher in Vancouver. Through her mother she received her earliest musical training and was introduced at an early age to the work of French composers like Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, both of whom were lifelong influences. From 1924-1928 she studied the piano with Jan Cherniavsky and music theory with Frederick Chubb. A scholarship from the Vancouver Woman's Musical Club enabled her to pursue studies at the Royal College of Music in 1928-1929 where she was a pupil of Kathleen Long, R.O. Morris, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. She studied in the 1930s and early 1940s with such composers as B√©la Bart√≥k, Aaron Copland, and Arnold Schoenberg. In 1944-1945, Coulthard worked for an entire academic year with Bernard Wagenaar of the Juilliard School, New York.W. Bruneau and D.G. Duke, Jean Coulthard: A Life in Music (Vancouver: Ronsdale Press, 2005), pp. 63-67, . In 1948 she met the British composer Elizabeth Poston (who was visiting Canada) and they began a long friendship and an extensive correspondence over the next 30 years.* Alabastor, John: Elizabeth Poston: Catalogue of Works with Biographical Context (2018) Beginning in 1925, Coulthard taught the piano privately in her mother's studio, and then as an independent teacher (1935‚Äì1947). In 1947 she joined the fledgling Department of Music in the Faculty of Arts of the University of British Columbia. The head of the department, Harry Adaskin, hired first Coulthard, and then (in 1949) Barbara Pentland, to teach theory and composition. Coulthard taught composition in the department, and later (from 1967) in the administratively distinct UBC School of Music (1967‚Äì1973). In 1956-7, she spent a year in Paris and in Roquebrune, southern France, beginning an opera and completing several substantial chamber and vocal works. A later sabbatical in London permitted Coulthard to work in a sustained way with Gordon Jacob, the British composer and orchestrator. Coulthard's composition students included Canadian composers Chan Ka Nin, Michael Conway Baker, Sylvia Rickard, Ernst Schneider, Robert Knox, Jean Ethridge, Joan Hansen, David Gordon Duke, Lloyd Burritt and Frederick Schipizky. In 1978, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1994, she was awarded the Order of British Columbia. Her work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

This effectively took the monopoly that was the Bell System and split it into entirely separate companies that would continue to provide telephone service. AT&T; would continue to be a provider of long-distance service, while the now-independent Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), nicknamed the 'Baby Bells', would provide local service, and would no longer be directly supplied with equipment from AT&T; subsidiary Western Electric. This divestiture was initiated by the filing in 1974 by the United States Department of Justice of an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T.; AT&T; was, at the time, the sole provider of telephone service throughout most of the United States. Furthermore, most telephonic equipment in the United States was produced by its subsidiary, Western Electric. This vertical integration led AT&T; to have almost total control over communication technology in the country, which led to the antitrust case, United States v. AT&T.; The plaintiff in the court complaint asked the court to order AT&T; to divest ownership of Western Electric. Feeling that it was about to lose the suit, AT&T; proposed an alternative: its breakup. It proposed that it retain control of Western Electric, Yellow Pages, the Bell trademark, Bell Labs, and AT&T; Long Distance. It also proposed that it be freed from a 1956 antitrust consent decree, then administered by Judge Vincent P. Biunno in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, that barred it from participating in the general sale of computers. In return, it proposed to give up ownership of the local operating companies. This last concession, it argued, would achieve the Government's goal of creating competition in supplying telephone equipment and supplies to the operative companies. The settlement was finalized on January 8, 1982, with some changes ordered by the decree court: the regional holding companies got the Bell trademark, Yellow Pages, and about half of Bell Labs. Effective January 1, 1984, the Bell System's many member companies were variously merged into seven independent \\"Regional Holding Companies\\", also known as Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or \\"Baby Bells\\". This divestiture reduced the book value of AT&T; by approximately 70%. Post-breakup structure The breakup of the Bell System resulted in the creation of seven independent companies that were formed from the original twenty-two AT&T-controlled; members of the System. On January 1, 1984, these companies were NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, Southwestern Bell Corporation, BellSouth, and US West. * NYNEX, acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1996, now part of Verizon Communications * Pacific Telesis, acquired by SBC in 1997, now part of AT&T; Inc. * Ameritech, acquired by SBC in 1999, now part of AT&T; Inc. * Bell Atlantic, merged with GTE in 2000 to form Verizon Communications * Southwestern Bell Corporation, rebranded as SBC Communications in 1995, acquired AT&T; Corporation in 2005 * BellSouth, acquired by AT&T; Inc. in 2006 * US West, acquired by Qwest in 2000, which in turn was acquired by CenturyLink in 2011 In addition, there were two members of the Bell System that were only partially owned by AT&T.; Both of these companies were monopolies in their coverage areas, received Western Electric equipment and had agreements with AT&T; whereby they were provided with long-distance service. They continued to exist in their pre-breakup form after the antitrust case, but no longer directly received Western Electric equipment, and were no longer bound to use AT&T; as their long-distance provider. These companies were: * Cincinnati Bell, now the only Bell System member to remain independent, covering the Cincinnati metropolitan area * Southern New England Telephone (SNET), acquired by SBC in 1998, now part of Frontier Communications, covering Connecticut. Effects The breakup led to a surge of competition in the long-distance telecommunications market by companies such as Sprint and MCI. AT&T;'s gambit in exchange for its divestiture, AT&T; Computer Systems, failed, and after spinning off its manufacturing operations (most notably Western Electric, which became Lucent, then Alcatel-Lucent, now Nokia) and other misguided acquisitions such as NCR and AT&T; Broadband, it was left with only its core business with roots as AT&T; Long Lines and its successor AT&T; Communications. It was at this point that AT&T; was purchased by one of its own spin-offs, SBC Communications, the company that had also purchased two other RBOCs and a former AT&T; associated operating company (Ameritech, Pacific Telesis, and SNET), and which later purchased another RBOC (BellSouth). One consequence of the breakup was that local residential service rates, which were formerly subsidized by long-distance revenues, began to rise faster than the rate of inflation. Long-distance rates, meanwhile, fell both due to the end of this subsidy and increased competition. The FCC established a system of access charges where long-distance networks paid the more expensive local networks both to originate and terminate a call. In this way, the implicit subsidies of the Bell System became explicit post-divestiture. These access charges became a source of strong controversy as one company after another sought to arbitrage the network and avoid these fees. In 2002 the FCC declared that Internet service providers would be treated as if they were local and would not have to pay these access charges. This led to VoIP service providers arguing that they did not have to pay access charges, resulting in significant savings for VoIP calls. The FCC was split on this issue for some time; VoIP services that utilized IP but in every other way looked like a normal phone call generally had to pay access charges, while VoIP services that looked more like applications on the Internet and did not interconnect with the public telephone network did not have to pay access charges. However, an FCC order issued in December 2011 declared that all VoIP services would have to pay the charges for nine years, at which point all access charges would then be phased out.Connect America Fund order details access charge reforms Another consequence of the divestiture was in how both national broadcast television (i.e., ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS) and radio networks (NPR, Mutual, ABC Radio) distributed their programming to their local affiliated stations. Prior to the breakup, the broadcast networks relied on AT&T; Long Lines' infrastructure of terrestrial microwave relay, coaxial cable, and, for radio, broadcast-quality leased line networks to deliver their programming to local stations. However, by the mid-1970s, the then-new technology of satellite distribution offered by other companies like RCA Astro Electronics and Western Union with their respective Satcom 1 and Westar 1 satellites started to give the Bell System competition in the broadcast distribution field, with the satellites providing higher video & audio quality, as well as much lower transmission costs. However, the networks stayed with AT&T; (along with simulcasting their feeds via satellite through the late 1970s to the early 1980s) due to some stations not being equipped yet with ground station receiving equipment to receive the networks' satellite feeds, and due to the broadcast networks' contractual obligations with AT&T; up until the breakup in 1984, when the networks immediately switched to satellite exclusively. This was due to several reasons ‚Äî the much cheaper rates for transmission offered by satellite operators that were not influenced by the high tariffs set by AT&T; for broadcast customers, the split of the Bell System into separate RBOCs, and the end of contracts that the broadcast companies had with AT&T.; AT&T; was allowed to enter the computer market after the breakup; observers expected that with Bell Labs and Western Electric, American Bell would challenge market leader IBM. The company's post-breakup strategy did not work out the way it had planned. Its attempt to enter the computer business failed, and it quickly realized that Western Electric was not profitable without the guaranteed customers the Bell System had provided. In 1995, AT&T; spun off its computer division and Western Electric, exactly as the government had initially asked it to do. It then re-entered the local telephone business that it had exited after the breakup, which had become much more lucrative with the rise of dial-up Internet access in the early 1990s. Even this, however, would not save AT&T; Corporation. It would soon be absorbed by one of the Baby Bells, SBC Communications (formerly Southwestern Bell), which then co-opted the AT&T; name to form the present-day AT&T; Inc. Evolution of the Baby Bells Verizon payphone with the Bell logo Following divestiture in 1984 and the creation of the seven Baby Bells, the service within the LATAs remained regulated until 1996, when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed. Following this, the Baby Bells began consolidating amongst themselves. Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 also established a way that regulators could approve BOCs to enter the interLATA market in regions where they provide local exchange service.Jerry A. Hausman, Gregory K. Leonard & J. Gregory Sidak, 'D'oes Bell Company Entry into Long-Distance Telecommunications Benefit Consumers?, 70 ANTITRUST L.J. 463, 463‚Äì64 (2002), http://economics.mit.edu/files/1032. In 1998, Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin Bell lines (covering 19 exchanges) to CenturyTel, which merged them into its company CenturyTel of the Midwest- Kendall. SBC Communications (named Southwestern Bell Corporation until 1995) purchased Pacific Telesis in 1997 for $16.5 billion, creating an organization with about 100,000 employees, an annual net income of $3 billion, and revenue of about $23.5 billion. SBC purchased Southern New England Telecommunications in 1998 for $5.01 billion, and Ameritech in 1999 for $61 billion, creating the largest U.S. local phone company at the time. AT&T; Corporation, the original parent, was acquired effective November 18, 2005, by SBC, which renamed itself AT&T; Inc. and began using the ticker symbol \\"T\\" and a new AT&T; corporate logo. The new company then acquired BellSouth for $85.8 billion on January 3, 2007, with FCC approval. Bell Atlantic merged with NYNEX on August 18, 1997 in a $25.6 billion deal, retaining the name Bell Atlantic, and then with non-Bell GTE on June 30, 2000 to create Verizon Communications in a $70 billion deal. Verizon sold all of its wireline operations in northern New England (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) in 2008 to FairPoint Communications for $2.7 billion; a new operating company, Northern New England Telephone Operations, was created. Operations in Vermont were later split into Telephone Operating Company of Vermont, but continued with FairPoint. In 2010, Verizon sold 4.8 million access lines in 14 states, including Verizon West Virginia (originally The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia), to Frontier Communications. US West was acquired by Qwest in June, 2000 for $43.5 billion. On April 6, 2011, Qwest was acquired by CenturyLink, an independent telephone provider, bringing Qwest Corporation, originally Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell under its control. While based in San Antonio, Texas since 1992, AT&T; Inc. moved its headquarters to Dallas by the end of 2008. The name change came after AT&T;'s merger with BellSouth, as well as with southeast-region telephone operations. Bedminster, New Jersey is home to the AT&T; Global Network Operations Center and is the headquarters of AT&T; Corp., the long-distance subsidiary of AT&T; Inc. The new AT&T; Inc. lacks the vertical integration that characterized the historic AT&T; Corporation and led to the Department of Justice antitrust suit. AT&T; Inc. announced it would not switch back to the Bell logo, thus ending usage of the Bell logo for corporate use by any of the Baby Bells, with the lone exception of Verizon. Financial arbitrage Due to discrepancies between the pricing of the \\"old\\" AT&T; shares and the new \\"when-issued\\" shares, investors were able to make risk-free profits, most spectacularly Edward O. Thorp, who made $2.5 million in what was at the time the NYSE's largest (nominal) block trade.

Development The RWD 3 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in Warsaw. Since their earlier design, the RWD 2 sports aircraft appeared quite successful, the Polish Military of Defence ordered in 1929 to develop its enlarged variant as a liaison aircraft. It retained the same fish-shaped fuselage without a direct view towards forward from the pilot's seat, though the view improved due to a thin fuselage profile before the pilot. At the same time, the RWD developed similar enlarged sports aircraft, the RWD 4, which shared many features with the RWD 3, but was powered with an inline engine and did not have folding wings. One prototype was built for ground trials and one flying prototype. It was completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in April 1930. Since it was found unsatisfactory as a liaison aircraft, it was handed over to sports aviation ‚Äì Academic Aero Club in Warsaw, with the civil registration SP-WAA. It was used for training and in some competitions. Unlike the RWD 3, the RWD 4 appeared more successful design. Description Wooden construction single-engine high-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout. The fuselage was rectangular in cross section (triangular in upper part), plywood- covered. Two-spar wings, covered with canvas, in front with plywood, were folding rearwards, unlike other early RWDs. Cantilever empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators). Crew of two was sitting in tandem in the fuselage.

He founded the city of Tughluqabad. His reign was cut short after five years when he died under mysterious circumstances in 1325. He was succeeded by Muhammad bin TughluqTughlaq Shahi Kings of Delhi: Chart The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 2, p. 369..  Early life  Literary, numismatic and epigraphic evidence makes it clear that Tughluq was the Sultan's personal name, and not an ancestral designation. His ancestry is debated among modern historians, because the earlier sources differ widely regarding it. Tughluq's court poet Badr-i Chach attempted to find a royal genealogy for his family, but this can be dismissed as flattery. This is clear from the fact that another courtier Amir Khusrau, in his Tughluq Nama, states that Tughluq described himself as an unimportant man (\\"awara mard\\") in his early career. The contemporary Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta states that Tughluq belonged to the \\"Qarauna tribe of the Turks\\", who lived in the hilly region between Turkestan and Sindh. Ibn Battuta's source for this claim was the Sufi saint Rukn-ud-Din Abul Fateh, but the claim is not corroborated by any other contemporary source. Firishta, based on inquiries at Lahore, wrote that the historians of India and the books had neglected to mention any clear statement on the origin of the dynasty, but wrote that there was a tradition that Tughluq's father was a Turkic slave of the earlier emperor Balban, and that his mother came from a Jat family of India. No contemporary sources corroborate this claim of his Jat ancestry.. Additionally the historian Fouzia Farooq Ahmed supports Amir Khusrau's assertion that Tughluq was not a Balbanid slave, because he was not part of the old Sultanate household or the nobility of Balban, and instead expressed his loyalty to the heterogenous Khalji regime through which he first entered military service. Different sources give different accounts of Tughluq's early career. Shams-i Siraj Afif, in his Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi states that Tughluq arrived in Delhi from Khorasan during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (r. 1296‚Äì1316), along with his brothers Rajab and Abu Bakr. However, Tughluq's own courtier Amir Khusrau, in his Tughluq Nama states that he was already present in Delhi during the reign of Alauddin's predecessor Jalal-ud-din (r. 1290-1296). The Tughluq Nama does not mention anything about Tughluq's arrival in India from a foreign land, thus implying that Tughluq was born in India. Tughlaq began his career as a menial servant in the service of a merchant where he served as a keeper of horses before entering Khalji service. In Khalji service Silver Tanka of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq Dated AH 724 According to Khusrau's Tughluq Nama, Tughluq spent a considerable time searching for a job in Delhi, before he joined the imperial guard of Jalaluddin Khalji. Khusrau states that Tughluq first distinguished himself in the early 1290s, during the Siege of Ranthambore, in which the Khalji forces were led by Ulugh Khan. Khusrau suggests that Tughluq was reduced to obscurity for a brief period after Jalaluddin was killed by his nephew Alauddin Khalji. This probably happened because, unlike many other nobles, Tughluq did not quickly change his loyalty to Alauddin. Nevertheless, it was during Alauddin's reign that Tughluq rose to prominence. He entered the Khalji service as a personal attendant of Alauddin's brother Ulugh Khan. At the Battle of Amroha (1305), in which the Khalji army defeated a Mongol force from the Chagatai Khanate, Tughluq was among the chief subordinates of the Khalji general Malik Nayak. During the 1306 Mongol invasion, Tughluq led the vanguard of the Khalji army, which was commanded by general Malik Kafur, and defeated the invaders. Alauddin appointed Tughluq as the governor of Multan, and then that of Dipalpur, both in present-day Pakistan. These provinces were located in the frontier region of the Delhi Sultanate, and included the routes used by the Mongol invaders. The fact that Alauddin trusted Tughluq with such challenging assignments suggests that Tughluq must have gained reputation for his martial skills by this time. Khusrau states that Tughluq defeated the Mongols 18 times; Ziauddin Barani, in his Tarikh-i Firuz Shahi, states this number as 20. Ibn Battuta's Rihla mentions an inscription at the Jama masjid of Multan, which recorded Tughluq's 29 victories over the Tatars (Turko- Mongols). None of the authors provide a list of Tughuq's victories against the Mongols, but these victories probably included successes in border skirmishes. After Alauddin's death in 1316, Malik Kafur controlled the Sultanate's administration for a brief period with Alauddin's minor son Shihabuddin Omar as a puppet ruler. There is no record of Tughluq opposing Kafur during this period. Kafur dispatched Ayn al-Mulk Multani to crush a rebellion in Gujarat, but was killed soon after, while Multani was in Chittor on his way to Gujarat. Alauddin's elder son Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah then took control of the administration, and sent Tughluq to Chittor with a message asking Multani to continue his march to Gujarat. Multani welcomed Tughluq at Chittor, but refused to continue the march, as his officers had not seen the new Sultan in person. Tughluq then returned to Delhi, and advised Mubarak Shah to send firmans (royal mandates) confirming his position to Multani's officers. The new Sultan agreed, and as a result, Multani's force resumed its march to Gujarat. Tughluq accompanied this force, although Multani retained its supreme command.  Rise to power  In July 1320, Mubarak Shah was murdered as a result of a conspiracy by his Hindu-origin general Khusrau Khan, who became the ruler of Delhi. Tughluq was one of the governors who refused to recognize Khusrau Khan as the new Sultan. However, he did not take any action against Khusrau Khan because the force commanded by him at Dipalpur was not strong enough to take on the imperial army at Delhi. Tughluq's son Fakhruddin Jauna (who later ascended the throne as Muhammad bin Tughluq), who was a high-ranked officer in Delhi, took the initiative to dethrone Khusrau Khan. He convened a secret meeting of his friends in Delhi, and then sent his messenger Ali Yaghdi to Dipalpur, asking his father for assistance in the matter. In response, Tughluq asked him to come to Dipalpur with the son of the Uchch governor Bahram Aiba, who was also opposed to Khusrau Khan. Accordingly, Fakhruddin and his companions - which included some slaves and servants - left Delhi for Dipalpur on horses one afternoon. Tughluq sent his officer Muhammad Sartiah to take control of the Sirsa fort on the Delhi-Dipalpur route to secure a safe passageway for his son. When Khusrau Khan came to know about the conspiracy, he dispatched his minister of war Shaista Khan in pursuit of Fakhruddin, but Shaista Khan could not catch the rebels. At Dipalpur, Tughluq and his son discussed the situation, and decided to put up a fight against Khusrau Khan. Tughluq declared that he wanted to dethrone Khusrau Khan for \\"the glory of Islam\\", because he was loyal to Alauddin's family, and because he wanted to punish the criminals in Dehli. Tughluq sent identical letters to five neighbouring governors, seeking their support: * Bahram, the governor of Uchch, joined Tughluq's cause and provided military support. * Mughlati, the governor of Multan, refused to rebel against the new Sultan. Tughluq's friend Bahram Siraj incited Mughlati's army against him. Facing a rebellion himself, Mughlati tried to flee but fell into a canal built during Tughluq's governorship of Multan. He was beheaded by a son of Bahram Siraj, but the Multan army did not join Tughluq's forces against the Sultan. * Malik Yak Lakkhi, the governor of Samana, not only refused to join Tughluq, but also sent his letter to Khusrau Khan and himself marched to Dipalpur against him. Yak Lakkhi was originally a Hindu slave, and may have been favoured by Khusrau Khan, which may explain his actions. After Tughluq's forces repelled his invasion of Dipalpur, he retreated to Samana. He was planning to join the Sultan at Delhi, but was killed by the angry citizens before he could do that. * Muhammad Shah Lur, the governor of Sindh, was facing a rebellion by his officers when he received Tughluq's letter. He later came to terms with his officers, and agreed to support Tughluq, but reached Delhi only after Tughluq ascended the throne. Tughluq later appointed him as the governor of Ajmer. * Hushang Shah, the governor of Jalor and a son of Kamal al-Din Gurg, also promised to support Tughluq. However, he deliberately reached Delhi only after the battle between the forces of Tughluq and Khusrau Khan was over. Tughluq retained him as the governor of Jalor. Tughluq sent another letter to Ayn al- Mulk Multani, who had become the wazir by this time. Multani was surrounded by Khusrau Khan's men when he received the letter, so he took the letter to the Sultan and expressed his loyalty. However, when Tughuq sent a second message to him, he expressed sympathy with Tughluq's cause. Multani stated that he was surrounded by Khusrau's allies, and therefore, would not take sides in the upcoming battle. He told Tughluq that he would withdraw on the approach of Tughluq's forces to Delhi, and that Tughluq could choose to retain him or kill him upon becoming the Sultan. According to Amir Khusrau, Tughluq's relatively small army consisted of warriors from a variety of ethnicities, including \\"Ghizz, Turks, Mongols, Rumis (Greeks), Rusi (Russians), Tajiks, and Khurasainis.\\" According to Khusrau, these soldiers were \\"people of pure birth and not racial mixtures\\". However, with the exception of a Mongol officer, Khusrau does not mention any soldiers from these ethnicities. According to historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena, Khusrau's enumeration of these ethnicities is \\"an official disguise\\" for the Hindu communities that fought for Tughluq, who claimed to be fighting for the \\"glory of Islam\\". The Khokhars were one of these communities: their ruler was Sahij Rai, and their chiefs included Gul Chandra and Niju. The Mewatis, also known as Meos, were another community of Hindu origin that supported Tughluq. Tughluq's officers captured a caravan carrying tribute from Sindh to Delhi, along with a number of horses. Tughuq distributed the seized treasure among his soldiers. Meanwhile in Delhi, in order to discourage any further conspiracies, Khusrau Khan consulted his counsellors, and ordered killings of Alauddin's three sons - Bahauddin, Ali, and Usman - who had earlier been blinded and imprisoned. Tughluq's army defeated Khusrau Khan's forces at the Battle of Saraswati and the Battle of Lahrawat. Khusrau Khan fled from the battlefield, but was captured and killed a few days later. Tughluq was proclaimed the new ruler on 6 September 1320. Reign Tughluq founded the Tughluq dynasty and reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi from 1320 to 1325.http://coinindia.com/galleries-tughluq.html Tughluq's policy was harsh against Mongols. He had killed envoys of the Ilkhan Oljeitu and punished Mongol prisoners harshly. He had fought various campaigns against the Mongols defeating them in 1305 at the Battle of Amroha. When Tughluq proceeded from Multan to Delhi, the tribe of Soomro revolted and took possession of Thatta. Tughluq appointed Tajuddin Malik as governor of Multan and Khw√°jah Khat√≠r as governor of Bhakkar and he left Malik Ali Sher in charge of Sehwan. In 1323, Tughluq sent his son Ulugh Khan (later Muhammad bin Tughluq) on an expedition to the Kakatiya capital Warangal. The ensuing Siege of Warangal resulted in the annexation of Warangal, and the end of the Kakatiya dynasty. In 1323 he appointed his son Muhammad Shah as his heir and successor and took a written promise or agreement to the arrangement from the ministers and nobles of the state. He also started construction of Tughlaqabad Fort. During his reign, Tughlaq built a stable administration dominated by Multanis, which reflects his native power base of Dipalpur and Punjab, and the means that he used to take power. Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq's tomb in Delhi Death In 1324, Tughluq turned his attention towards Bengal, currently in the midst of a civil war. After victory, he placed Nasiruddon on the throne of West Bengal as a vassal state, and East Bengal was annexed. On his way back to Delhi, he fought with Tirhut (north Bihar). At Afghanpur in February 1325, the wooden pavilion used for his reception collapsed, killing him and his second son Prince Mahmud Khan. Ibn Battuta claimed it was a conspiracy, hatched by his vizier, Jauna Khan (Khwajah Jahan).

Martin received the commission for the work in 1944, though progress was delayed by work on the oratorio In Terra Pax. The Petite symphonie concertante was completed the following year and received its premiere in Zurich on May 27, 1946, under the direction of Paul Sacher, who is also the work's dedicatee. Sacher's commission prompted Martin to assume the unusual ensemble of harp, harpsichord, piano and string orchestra divided into two groups, though all accounts suggest the final choice of instruments was the composer's own. Using all of the common stringed instruments available, Martin desired to use the harp, harpsichord and piano not as accompanying, or 'basso continuo' instruments (as is often their role) but as solos, thus being a distant echo of J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, and justifying the work's title of symphonie concertante. The work gained Martin international recognition. The Petite symphonie concertante is in two movements, separated by the briefest of pauses. Each movement may then be divided into two 'halves', though the relationship between each part differs considerably between the two: the first comprises a slow introduction of forty-six bars out of which the following Allegro derives all of its motivic material; the second begins with an Adagio which showcases the three solo instruments (harp, piano, then harpsichord) before breaking into a lively march. The work is Neoclassical in outlook, and his approach reflects Martin's adoration of Bach. Martin's style draws elements from both the musical styles and traditions of France (such as the use of harmony to create local colour and the freer formal organisation) and Austro-Germany (such as the generally polyphonic style and the dense motivicism). The work also demonstrates Martin's use of the 12-tone technique, though in an entirely different way from the composers of the Second Viennese School. A 12-note row is apparent at the opening of the first movement, though Martin treats it as he does any other thematic or motivic material: it appears in various transpositions (all twelve, if fragmentary statements are included) but is never used in inversion, retrograde or retrograde-inversion forms, and is by no means present throughout the work. The row also demonstrates some other characteristic features of the composer's 12-tone technique, including the use of constant rhythmic values, no octave transpositions within the series, and the row's use frequently as an accompanimental ostinato. Later in the movement however, Martin does demonstrate his own take on the technique, common in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and others, of 'telescoping' his row forms, that is, the final note of one statement is also the first of the next at a different transposition, though unlike these composers, Martin only uses fragments of each row form. The piece was intended for the so-called \\"revival harpsichord\\", the large early-20th-century instruments built in the piano tradition by makers such as Robert Goble and Pleyel. It is one of the few pieces in the sinfonia concertante genre to be composed in the twentieth century. Fearing that the unusual instrumentation of the \\"Petite symphonie concertante\\" might limit performances, Martin later rescored the work for a conventional large orchestra (without solo instruments) as the \\"Symphonie concertante\\".

In 1895, Northwestern University bought the American College of Dental Surgery and merged the two schools into one. After Dr. Swain retired as the dean in 1897, Dr. GV Black took over the position. He served as the Professor of Pathology before his appointment. After becoming the dean, he worked to re-organize the curriculum of the dental school. In 1902, the Dental School was moved to the corner of the Lake and Dearborn Streets, along with the Pharmacy and the Law Schools after the University purchased the building of Tremont Hotel. Dr. Thomas Lewis Gilmer became the next dean after Dr. Black died. Arthur D. Black, son of Dr. GV Black, became the fourth dean of the dental school after Dr. Gilmer's retirement in 1918. Dr. Arthur Black was instrumental in organizing the World Dental Congress along with the Century of Progress Fair in Chicago in 1933. Under Dr. Arthur Black the dental school moved to the Montgomery Ward Memorial. After Dr. Black died of Pneumonia, Dr. Charles W. Freeman became the next Dean in 1938 and served till 1953. Dr. Freeman was noted to create one of the first centers for dental research at the Dental School. In addition, he promoted the foreign student program, and established the Cleft Palate Institute involving the dental, medical, and speech schools. After Dr. Freeman retired. Dr. George W. Teuscher was appointed the next dean and served the position until 1971. In 1972, Dr. Norman Olsen became the next dean.

His feast day is 5 August in the Christian calendar. He and Thaddeus are credited with the Liturgy of Addai and Mari. Despite the fact that there is little, if any, concrete information on Mari, he is still venerated as a saint by the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. He is distinct from St Mari of the seventy disciples with whom the Apocryphal Acts of Mar Mari are connected. References Bibliography * Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John.

The current members are lead singer and guitarist Nick Whitecross, keyboardist Jon Kingsley Hall, second keyboardist George Stewart, and guitarist Simon Aldridge. Former members include saxophonist Josephine Wells, violinist Peter Barnett, drummer Stevie Cusack, and vocalist Sylvia Griffin. Career The band formed in 1980 at the Royal College of Music, located in South Kensington, London. Their debut single was \\"Don't Hide in the Shadows\\", recorded with producer Martin Hannett at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. Hannett had previously worked with Joy Division, the Durutti Column, and John Cooper Clarke, but it was not until they dropped their first manager (celebrated in their song \\"Michael\\"), and signed a recording contract with Magnet Records that they began to get any airplay. They recorded their debut studio album, Naked, at AIR Studios with Colin Thurston as the main producer. The group had wanted Brian Eno to produce the album but Magnet thought Thurston would make a more commercial impact. As well as investing in a renowned producer, Magnet paid for promotional videos to be made for the singles \\"Mr. Blunt\\" (shot at the Long Man of Wilmington) and \\"Watching Their Eyes\\". After these of near-misses, their single \\"The Last Film\\" reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, their only hit in the UK. Their album, Naked, reached No. 54 on the UK Albums Chart. Their first Billboard Hot 100 entry was \\"Maybe This Day\\", which reached No. 87 in the chart in 1983. In 1984, they released their second album What Noise. This album did not attract as much attention and distribution was not as widespread as their other albums. It never received a worldwide release. In 1985, following the departure of some of the members, the band shortened their name to KTP and released several singles that placed on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The most successful was \\"Certain Things Are Likely\\", which spent three weeks at No. 1 in 1987. That song also became their second Hot 100 entry when it peaked at No. 97 on the chart later that year. From the same album, \\"One Step\\" was the biggest selling single in Italy that year. In 1988, the band released the standalone single, \\"Stand Up (Get Down)\\", on a new label WEA; It would prove to be their only release on that label after it failed to chart, and they wouldn't release any more new material for five years. Kissing the Pink's last physically-released album, Sugarland, which was their first in seven years, was a blend of psychedelic music and dance-pop. Since then, the band have made an album with Ecologist called Hot Filth which took the mixing of psychedelic music with jazz and other musical forms further still. In 2015, KTP released two albums digitally on Bandcamp: Digital People, and FatHome. Collaborations Whitecross, Hall and Stewart collaborated on many dance records in the early 1990s, and made it to the top of the dance charts in 1994 with the artist Mike (\\"Twangling (Three Fingers in a Box)\\" on Pukka Records). They recorded an album in 2003 with jazz saxophonist Candy Dulfer called Right In My Soul. They also worked with Gareth Gates on his Pictures of the Other Side album. Whitecross has written a considerable amount of material for pop artists such as Kim Wilde (including her Top 40 hit \\"Heart Over Mind\\"), Jem, Jaci Velasquez, Jonna Lee, Glen Scott, Leslie Clio, and Shea Seger. The band wrote and feature on four tracks on the X-Press 2 album Makeshift Feelgood, alongside Tim DeLaughter, Kurt Wagner and Rob Harvey from The Music. Marchioness disaster In 1989, former KTP saxophonist Jo Wells, who had gone on to tour with Tears for Fears and the Communards, was aboard a boat in the Marchioness disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 51 people. Afterward Wells suffered a nervous breakdown and turned to alcohol. She lost the control of her lip that is essential to players of brass instruments. She is now unable to work, has sold two of her saxophones, and lives on Income Support.

It surrounds the islands of Bahrain. The King Fahd Causeway crosses the western section of the Gulf of Bahrain, connecting Saudi Arabia to Bahrain. Geography The King Fahd Causeway over the Gulf of Bahrain viewed from the east The Gulf of Bahrain is a large bay lying on the west side of the Persian Gulf, between the peninsula of Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Midway between the northerly tip of Qatar and the coast of Saudi Arabia lies Bahrain, a group of six islands and many small islets. The Gulf of Bahrain thus has two openings to the Persian Gulf, the westernmost of which is spanned by a causeway leading to Saudi Arabia. The elongated southern portion of the Gulf of Bahrain forms the Gulf of Salwah. To the southeast of Bahrain Island, and close to the coast of Qatar, lie the Hawar Islands, now part of Bahrain. The King Fahd Causeway that connects Saudi Arabia to the island of Bahrain was inaugurated on 26 November 1986. It consists of five bridges linked by otherwise solid embankments and the design was chosen to try to minimise the environmental impact. Another causeway, the Qatar‚ÄìBahrain Causeway, is planned to link Bahrain to Qatar. This one will be solid for about half its length and the other half will be bridge. The presence of the causeway is likely to have a considerable effect on the circulation of water in the Gulf. Flora and fauna The Hawar Islands, just off the coast of Qatar, were listed as a Ramsar site in 1997. they are home to many bird species including Socotra cormorants. On the main island there are small herds of Arabian oryx and sand gazelle. The Gulf of Bahrain is shallow and the waters have a small thermal capacity. They are subject to wide fluctuations in temperature, with a range of around the coasts. The water is also rather more saline (10%) than other parts of the Persian Gulf. Around Bahrain there are seagrass meadows, coral reefs, mudflats and mangrove thickets. These areas are important for the biodiversity of the area, providing habitats for invertebrates, juvenile fish, turtles and dugongs. Bahrain has been expanding its land area by dredging the seabed and depositing material around its coast. In 1963, the area of Bahrain was and by 2007 it was . Extensive coral reefs in the adjoining seas have been destroyed and the increased sediment in the sea has had a deleterious effect on others. The Fasht Adham reef between Bahrain and Qatar was damaged by heat stress in 1996 and 1998 but has since been almost completely destroyed.

His patriotic songs were playlist staples on the national radio station Radio Rwanda during the war from October 1990 to July 1994 before the Rwandan Patriotic Front took power. He was tried and convicted for incitement to genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 2008. He died of diabetes at a Beninese hospital in late 2018.  Background and role during the genocide Bikindi, an ethnic Hutu,\\"RWANDAN POP STAR GETS 15 YEARS FOR ROLE IN GENOCIDE\\", Associated Press via Fox News (2 December 2008). was born in Rwerere in the northwestern prefecture of Gisenyi, the same region from which President Habyarimana and many of the key figures in his MRND regime originated. At the time of the genocide, he was a \\"well-known composer and singer of popular music and director of the performance group Irindiro Ballet.\\" His songs were described as having \\"elliptical lyrics and catchy tunes\\",Benesch, Susan.

The New York Times. 3 December 2008 He was additionally a civil servant of the Ministry of Youth and Sport and a member of the MRND party. Some of his songs directed against the Tutsi were played on Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines to incite killings. He left the country a few days before the beginning of the genocide, but returned later in June. It is a matter of debate whether and to what extent he participated in the genocide as such, but according to the ruling of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was associated with the extremist Interahamwe militia and publicly urged Hutus to exterminate all Tutsis in June 1994. After the RPF takeover, he fled the country. His songs are banned in Rwanda since 1994.  Trial  =Indictment and arrest= Bikindi was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). He was charged with the following: conspiracy to commit genocide; genocide, or alternatively complicity in genocide; direct and public incitement to commit genocide, and murder and persecution, as crimes against humanity.Indictment against Bikindi, from the ICTR, last amended 15 June 2005 The indictment stated that Bikindi \\"composed, sang, recorded or distributed musical works extolling Hutu solidarity and accusing Tutsis of enslaving Hutus\\".Rwandan singer on genocide charge. The Independent, 11 September 2006 The prosecution cited a song entitled \\"The Awakening\\" but commonly referred to as \\"I hate these Hutus\\" (\\"Nanga Abahutu\\"), which attacked \\"pro-Tutsi\\" Hutus and specifically those Hutus who collaborated with the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front insurgents against the government. In addition, it was argued that in the months prior to the genocide, Bikindi had \\"consulted with President Juv√©nal Habyarimana, Minister of Youth and Sports Callixte Nzabonimana and MRND-aligned military authorities on song lyrics\\" before releasing them to be played on the Hutu Power radio station RTLM.Musician again pleads not guilty to genocide, Hirondelle.org, 8 March 2003 The prosecution also claimed that during the 100 days of genocide from 7 April to 14 July 1994, Bikindi participated personally in the killings, both in Kigali and Gisenyi prefecture, and helped to recruit and organise Interahamwe militias. Following his arrest in Leiden, Netherlands on 12 July 2001, Bikindi fought extradition and requested asylum. However, eight months later, on 27 March 2002, he was placed in the custody of the ICTR. He subsequently entered a plea of not guilty to all the charges against him and was imprisoned at the United Nations Detention Facility (UNDF) in Arusha, Tanzania. After a series of delays, his war crimes trial was set to begin on 15 May 2006. He was represented by the chairman of the Kenyan section of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), Wilfred Ngunjiri Nderitu. = Details = In addition to other evidence, the prosecution cited a song celebrating the abolition of monarchy and the regaining of independence from 1959 to 1961: a Rwandan expert in the trial later expounded that the latter song could not have been addressed to the Rwandan nation as a whole, because the Tutsis were associated with the Rwandan monarchy and colonial regime, and that it was impossible to hate the monarchy without hating the Tutsis.INSIDE THE MUSIC OF AN ARTIST CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE.

The conviction stemmed from the fact that the court considered it proved beyond reasonable doubt that towards the end of June 1994 he had made a speech from an Interahamwe vehicle equipped with a public address system, urging and subsequently reminding the Hutu population to exterminate all Tutsis, whom he referred to as \\"snakes\\".\\"Rwanda singer jailed for genocide\\", BBC, 2 December 2008 All the other charges were dismissed; in particular, the court considered that while some songs had an inciting character, they had all been written before 1994, thus before the genocide, and that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that Bikindi had played a role in the dissemination of his songs on radio during the genocide, or that he had personally engaged in killings or organising of militias.The Prosecutor v. Simon Bikindi, Case No. ICTR-01-72-T. Judgement and Sentence ‚Äì 2 December 2008 Significance The trial had been considered problematic because of the troubling possibility of an artist being arbitrarily prosecuted for his work, art being open to a variety of interpretations.

She cited the fact that Bikindi had adopted her son, who had a Tutsi father, and had helped their Tutsi neighbours against Hutu murderers. Mukabanana claimed that after Bikindi wrote \\"I hate Hutus\\", she asked him why he had written that and pointed out the possibility of the RPF's winning the war.

Fronted by the floppy-fringed Ryan, they became one of the better-known outfits from a crop of jangly indie bands that sprang up around that time. They made their debut with \\"God Bless\\", an early release by Creation Records. Shortly afterwards, Lilley was replaced on drums by John Rowland. Two further singles followed; their second, \\"Therese\\", was included on the C86 compilation album. Like their contemporaries Primal Scream, The Mighty Lemon Drops and The Weather Prophets, The Bodines went on to sign up with a major label with great hopes of transferring their success to the mainstream charts. The group joined Magnet Records, where a remix of \\"Therese\\" became their major label debut. In July 1986, The Bodines participated in the Festival of the Tenth Summer. The Bodines's debut album, Played (produced by Ian Broudie, later to enjoy success as a recording artist as the Lightning Seeds) scraped into No. 94 in the UK Albums Chart, in the summer of 1987. None of the Bodines' singles got into the UK Singles Chart. Under pressure for failing to deliver the hit record that their major label backers required, the Bodines split up, albeit temporarily. Rowland went on to play with The Rainkings. In 1989, a reformed line-up of Ryan, Brotherton, new bassist Ian Watson, and new drummer Spencer Birtwistle released the single \\"Decide\\" on Manchester's Play Hard label and contributed a further new track to the same label's Hand to Mouth compilation. A couple of years later, Ryan reappeared with a new band called Medalark Eleven (misnamed after Harlem Globetrotters' Meadowlark Lemon), assisted by Gareth Thomas on bass and Adrian Donohue on drums.

Her father was either Jim Reed, Belle's first husband, or Cole Younger. Early life Pearl Starr was born in Rich Hill, Missouri. As a small child, she moved often before her outlaw father died in a gunfight when she was six. Her mother then married a Cherokee named Sam Starr, and settled beside the Canadian River in the Indian Territory at a place called Younger's Bend. Starr was 21 when her mother Belle Starr was murdered. Belle Starr claimed that Pearl was the daughter of the outlaw Cole Younger. While no official record exists, pictures of a young Pearl Starr show an uncanny resemblance to Cole Younger. Her parentage always may be in doubt. Most historical writers accept that Starr gave birth to an illegitimate daughter named Flossie in April 1887 when she was 18. Belle Starr sent her daughter to relatives to have her baby. In 1888, Pearl Starr's brother Edwin was found in possession of stolen property and was shot by his accomplice. What became of Starr's daughter is unknown, but in the summer of 1888, Pearl Starr returned alone to her mother's house at Younger's Bend to care for her brother. Prostitution Edwin's case went to trial in July 1889. He was found guilty and sent to prison. About this time, Starr married Will Harrison, but the couple were divorced in 1891. Capitalizing on the dime novel fame of Belle, Pearl Reed changed her name to Pearl Starr at this time. She became a prostitute in Van Buren, Arkansas ostensibly to make money for the purpose of getting her brother out of prison. She eventually put together a defense team that managed to secure a presidential pardon for Edwin in 1893. Starr moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas and established her own bordello. Located on \\"the Row,\\" Fort Smith's waterfront street of gambling halls, saloons and bordellos, the house was identified with a bright red star surrounded by lighted pearls. The parlor featured a talented piano player, good whiskey, and supposedly the \\"most beautiful girls west of the Mississippi.\\" Business prospered, and Pearl purchased additional brothels as well as invested in saloons and other property. Starr had another illegitimate daughter in 1894 and named her Ruth. Starr married Arthur Erbach in 1897 and had a son with him in 1898. Her new husband and son died of malaria within a year's time. Both are buried in the Oak Cemetery in Fort Smith. By 1902, she was living with Dell Andrews and, though not married to him, had another daughter, Jennette, in November. The only time Starr was implicated in a crime was in 1911. After a burglary at a general merchandise store in Fort Smith, police found several stolen items hidden at Starr's Winslow home. She was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to a year in the Arkansas State Penitentiary. Posting $2,000 bail, Starr's attorneys appealed the case to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which overturned the verdict. Last years In 1916, the city of Fort Smith enacted ordinances making prostitution illegal. For some time, Starr's activities were overlooked, but she eventually was arrested. The charges were dropped on the understanding that Starr would leave the community. In 1921, at age 53, she left for Douglas, Arizona. She died there on July 6, 1925 and was buried in Calvary Cemetery. Flossie Starr's account Starr's daughter Flossie was credited with writing a two- part article for the Dallas Morning News Sunday editions on April 30 and May 7, 1933. According to these articles, Starr fully believed that her brother Edwin, always resentful of his mother's attention to Pearl Starr, was their mother's killer, but was never able to prove it.

Service history Assigned to the West Indies Squadron, Swatara stood out from Hampton Roads on 12 January 1866 for Bermuda and the West Indies. She called at various ports, including Port of Spain, Trinidad; La Guajira, Venezuela; Cura√ßao, Netherlands West Indies; and Havana. Departing Cuba on 1 May, Swatara arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on the 7th for repairs. =European Squadron, 1866-1869= Departing Washington on 16 June, Swatara steamed to Norfolk, Virginia. Assigned to the European Squadron, she stood out from Hampton Roads on 27 June and called at Fayal, Azores, before arriving at Lisbon on 19 July 1866 to join flagship and other members of her squadron. After visiting Southampton, England, Swatara anchored at Bremerhaven, Germany, 3 August to 8 September, representing United States concern over uneasiness in Europe in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War. Subsequently cruising southward, Swatara, called at Den Helder, Netherlands; Southampton, England; and the major French Atlantic seaports: Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Rochefort, and Bordeaux.

Bound for Mediterranean duty, the sloop put into Tangier, Morocco; and Gibraltar; passing on to Spanish and French ports during November 1866. On word that John Surratt, wanted for conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, had been arrested in Rome, Swatara called at Civitavecchia, Papal States. Meanwhile, Surratt had escaped and fled to Alexandria, Egypt, where he was recaptured. Swatara arrived there on 20 December 1866, and returned with Surratt to the United States. Depositing him at the Washington Navy Yard on 18 February, 1867, she returned to Lisbon. She continued to cruise in the Mediterranean area throughout the first half of 1867, replenishing at Lisbon from 1 July to 6 August replenishing at Lisbon.

From February to May 1870 and from July to September 1871 she was anchored in Caldera Bay, San Domingo City, and other Dominican ports. After calling at Matanzas, Cuba, Swatara sailed via Key West and Hampton Roads to New York. She returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard where she was placed out of commission on 20 December 1871. Nominally undergoing extensive repairs, Swatara was completely dismantled and given a new hull and machinery to become, in actuality, a new ship.

The story deals primarily with the aftermath of the attacks and the American invasion of Afghanistan, as the boys come face to face with Osama bin Laden when they are mistakenly shipped to Afghanistan. Plot The four boys wait at the bus-stop wearing gas-masks for defence from anthrax. Since the September 11 attacks, everything has changed in South Park: everyone is afraid of terrorists, American flags are plastered everywhere to show widespread patriotism and Stan's mother has become catatonic and lies on the couch all day watching the news. Upon arriving at school, the boys discover that they must, in response to President Bush's request for charity to Afghanistan, donate a dollar. The boys' dollars are sent to four Afghan kids who closely resemble them. Though their town is in ruins after excessive American bombing and the unconverted American money is unusable in Afghanistan, in return the four Afghan boys send the South Park boys a goat in the mail. The boys realize that their parents will not let them keep the goat and so they try to send it back to Afghanistan. Since only U.S. military planes are flying over the country, they can only do it by sneaking the goat aboard a military plane. They sneak into a nearby base, able to do so when the guards mistake the goat for Stevie Nicks there for a USO show; however, the boys wind up on the plane too, and are sent to Afghanistan. The boys manage to find their Afghan counterparts, who refuse to take back the goat; furthermore, the two groups get into an argument over America. The South Park boys assumed that most Afghans liked America, but the Afghan boys reveal that they hate the country, viewing America as an evil empire plotting world domination. This angers the boys, as they cannot return the goat this way. After the boys leave to try to get home, they get caught by terrorists and are brought to the hiding place of Osama bin Laden, who is depicted as completely insane. He communicates by repeating the same few words over and over including \\"Durka\\", \\"Burka\\", \\"Jihad\\" and \\"Allah\\". Bin Laden makes a video tape revealing his hostages and again the U.S. Army mistakes the goat for Stevie Nicks and declares they must rescue her. The Afghan boys, finding out about this, go and rescue the American boys despite their argument, stating that if they do not help the innocent they are no better than America. Cartman, however, proclaims he will \\"take care\\" of Bin Laden. The U.S. Army storms the cave to rescue \\"Stevie Nicks\\". Amidst the firefight, Kenny and his Afghan counterpart are strafed by a U.S. helicopter, and after the reaction the boys wind up getting in yet another fight. During the battle, Cartman and Bin Laden are fighting between themselves in a manner similar to the anti-German/anti-Japanese Looney Tunes and Disney's cartoon propaganda produced during World War II. Cartman ultimately tricks Bin Laden into donning an Uncle Sam costume and hands him a lit stick of dynamite as a microphone. Terrorists see Bin Laden in his costume and shoot him up before the dynamite explodes. The subdued and dazed Bin Laden is killed by an American soldier and the commander of the American forces proclaim the war is won. With the Taliban overthrown and Bin Laden dead, the boys say goodbye to the Afghan kids who still hate them. Stan replies with \\"maybe... someday... we can learn to hate you too.\\" The Afghan kids reply positively, confusing Kyle. The troops celebrate their victory with a show by Fleetwood Mac and \\"Stevie Nicks.\\" Before they leave, Stan sticks a small American flag into the ground, confusing Kyle, who thought the Afghan kids had talked Stan into not liking America. Stan replies, \\"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home, our team. If you don't want to root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.\\" The episode ends with Stan and Kyle saluting the American flag, saying \\"Go America\\" and finishing with \\"Go Broncos.\\" Production According to the creators in the DVD commentary, much of the inspiration for the episode came from fear there would be a second attack. The depiction of Bin Laden was based on old Loony Tunes cartoons from World War II. Also in the commentary, Matt Stone stated that he hates Stevie Nicks. In 2011, Comedy Central re-aired the episode - along with \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" - after the death of Osama bin Laden. Reception The episode was nominated for a 2002 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, but lost to Futurama. IGN rated the episode a 9/10, stating \\"There are a number of terrific jokes that manage to perfectly capture the mood and climate at the time,\\" and praising the episode for its Looney Tunes parody between Cartman and Osama bin Laden. They conclude that the episode is an example of \\"an accurate and thoughtful appraisal of the national mood and the international realities, as well as a bit of patriotic chest thumping in the aftermath of a crisis,\\" and state that it is why South Park stands out in television. Internet critic Lindsay Ellis criticized the episode for feeling like \\"it was written in about an hour\\" and for its sophmoric humor being tasteless in light of the tragedies. However, she gave positive notices for the episode being one of the first to discuss the Afghanistan invasion and the cycle of fear the media was pushing at the time and for still having a message of solidarity for America at the end of the episode. Home release \\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,\\" along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park: the Complete Fifth Season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.

He was the son of a Welsh immigrant Morgan Thornley. He also was a talented watercolorist, engraver, and lithographer. His lithographs after the works of Corot, Pissarro, Degas and Puvis de Chavannes were acclaimed by his peers and awarded at the Salon de Paris. His paintings were exhibited beginning in 1878. He won the Mention of Honor in 1881 and a Third Class medal in 1888. Thornley embraced the Impressionist movement early in his career, which brought him much success.

Although his compositions include a wide variety of genres and instrumentation choices, he is best known for his works for solo guitar, and particularly the Koyunbaba suite. Domeniconi's style is characterized by his adoption of multicultural influences. His works explore and borrow from a wide variety of national traditions, including Turkish, Indian, Brazilian, and many more. Biography Domeniconi was born in Cesena, Italy. He received his first formal guitar lessons in 1960 from Carmen Lenzi Mozzani, granddaughter of the famous guitarist and luthier Luigi Mozzani. Making rapid progress, he won first prizes at the Ancona International Festival of Guitar in 1960 and 1962. After obtaining his diploma from the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro, Domeniconi left Italy for West Berlin, where he studied composition at the Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Musik under Heinz Friedrich Hartig.Harries 2014, 1. Upon graduation in 1969, Domeniconi took up a teaching position in Berlin, which he held until 1992. Already in the 1960s, Domeniconi became interested in Turkish music traditions, which he studied in situ in 1977-1980,Wade 2010, 183. establishing and heading the first classical guitar course at the Istanbul University State Conservatory, and on many shorter trips he took to Istanbul.Cumming 2005, 31. Works The list of Domeniconi's published compositions includes more than 150 titles. Most of these works are scored either for solo guitar, or an ensemble that includes one or more guitars. One of the defining characteristics of Domeniconi's music is its exploration of various national styles, which include Turkish (Koyunbaba, Variations on an Anatolian Folk Song, Sonatina turca, Oyun), Indian (Gita, Dhvani), various South American styles (Suite Sud Americana, Vidala, Sonido), and many others.Harries 2014, 3. One of the works inspired by Turkish music, the Koyunbaba suite of 1985-86, eventually became Domeniconi's most well-known work. Throughout the 1990s it was particularly frequently programmed in concerts and recorded by numerous performers.Wade 2010, 183-184. The piece is named after a Turkish saint. The liner notes to a recording made by Domeniconi in 1991 for a Turkish record label state that the work is a suite pastorale, describing \\"the natural beauty of a little bay\\" overlooking the Aegean Sea, where the saint was said to live centuries ago.Liner notes to: Eyl√ºl Prod√ºksion / Raks M√ºzik ‚Äì 9712063 \\"Concerto di Berlinbul / Koyunbaba\\", performed by Carlo Domeniconi (guitar), Adil Arslan (saz), and G√ºrer Aykal conducting the Turkish Presidential Symphony Orchestra.

In Iran, it is also known as HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand, HƒÅm≈´n-e Hƒ´rmand, or DaryƒÅcheh-ye Sƒ´stƒÅn (\\"Lake Sƒ´stƒÅn\\"). HƒÅm≈´n is generic term which refers to shallow lakes (or lagoons), usually seasonal, that occur in deserts of southeast Iran and adjacent areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan as a product of snowmelt in nearby mountains in spring. The term HƒÅm≈´n Lake (or Lake HƒÅm≈´n) is equally applied to HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand (entirely in Iran), as well to shallow lakes HƒÅm≈´n-e Sabari and HƒÅm≈´n-e Puzak, which extend into territory of present-day Afghanistan with latter being almost entirely inside Afghanistan. The Hamun is fed by numerous seasonal water tributaries; the main tributary is the perennial Helmand River, which originates in Afghanistan Hindu Kush mountains. In modern times, and prior to the existence of the dams for agricultural irrigation, spring floods would bring into existence much larger lakes. Geography It is located in Afghanistan which forms on the Sƒ´stƒÅn marshes west of the Dasht-e MƒÅrgow desert where the Helmand River forms a dendritic delta. Water flows in a circular fashion through a string of lakes starting with HƒÅm≈´n-e Puzak in the northeast, sweeping into HƒÅm≈´n-e Sabari and finally overflows into HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand in the southwest. It used to cover an area of about 4,000 km2 (1,500 mi2) with dense reed beds and tamarisk thicket fringing on the edges of the upper lakes. The area was thriving with wildlife animals and migratory birds. A trapezoid-shaped basalt outcropping, known as Mount Khajeh,Mount Khajeh is named after an Islamic pilgrimage site on the hill: the tomb and shrine of Khwaja Ali Mahdi, descendant of Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib rises up as an island in the middle of which used to be HƒÅm≈´n Lake and the northeastern edge of HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand. Its flat-topped peak rises up 609 meters above sea level with a diameter 2-2.5 km, being the only remaining natural uplift in the Sƒ´stƒÅn flatlands. Hamun Lake is sometimes categorized as three sibling shallow lakes Hamun-e Helmand, HƒÅm≈´n-e Sabari and HƒÅm≈´n-e Puzak, the latter extending into the Lash wa Juwayn District of Farah Province in Afghanistan. Lake HƒÅm≈´n is fed primarily by water catchments on the Afghani side, including the Harut River. It is in the Sistan region and it is in the Lash wa Juvayn District of the Farah Province of Afghanistan. The Harut River flows into the lake on the Afghanistan side of the border. In 1976, when rivers in Afghanistan were flowing regularly, the amount of water in the lake was relatively high. Between 1999 and 2001, however, the lake all but dried up and disappeared, as can be seen in the 2001 satellite image. When droughts occur in Afghanistan, or the water in watersheds that support Lake HƒÅm≈´n is drawn down by other natural or human-induced reasons, the end result is a dry lake bed in Iran. In addition, when the lake is dry, seasonal winds blow fine sands off the exposed lake bed. The sand is swirled into huge dunes that may cover a hundred or more fishing villages along the former lakeshore. Wildlife around the lake is negatively impacted and fisheries are brought to a halt. Changes in water policies and substantial rains in the region hope to effect a return of much of the water in Lake Hamoun by 2003. In 1975 the hƒÅm≈´n, together with HƒÅm≈´n-e Sabari, was designated a Ramsar site. alt= History =Archeological sites= The area has important archeological remains. The ruins of an ancient Achaemenid city Dahan-e Gholaman (‚ÄúGate of Slaves‚Äù) are near the HƒÅm≈´n Lake . In 1975 the HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand, together with HƒÅm≈´n-e Sabari, was designated a Ramsar site. =Irrigation= In the past five millennia, people around Hamoun Oasis, for the most part, lived in harmony with the wetlands and their wildlife. Specific culture formed around the Hamoun with a way of life suited to the desert wetlands. They fashioned long reed boats to navigate the shallow waters and erected squat, red clay houses to withstand the heat of the desert. Their livelihood was based almost entirely on hunting, fishing, and farming. Until the late 20th century, irrigation waxed and waned in the Sƒ´stƒÅn Basin for over 4,000 years without destroying the wetlands, but then population rapidly increased and new more efficient water management technologies were brought to the region. Soon irrigation schemes began to snake their way throughout the basin. Farther west, revolving Afghan governments constructed large dams (Arghandab Dam, Kajaki Dam) that diverted water from the upper reaches of the river. =Devastation by extreme droughts in 1999-2001= Precipitation variability in the Hindu Kush results in alternating periods of flooding in the Helmand and droughts, which may cause entire lagoons to dry up. This occurred several times in the 20th century when only the uppermost of the lakes remained flooded. Landsat satellite imagery show how dramatic decrease in precipitation resulted in decrease of snow-covered area in the Helmand Basin, from 41,000 km2 in 1998 to 26,000 km2 in 2000. By 2001, Iran and Afghanistan were experienced for the third consecutive year an extreme drought that was so severe that the Hamoun dried out completely. Sƒ´stƒÅn's population, swelled by refugees from war-torn Afghanistan, has been severely affected by water shortages. Irrigation channels have run dry and agriculture has come to a standstill, which has resulted in the abandonment of many villages as people migrate in search of water. Combination of drought and the massive irrigation proved to be a shock to the wetlands. Within five years period (1998-2002) once fertile wetlands rapidly deteriorated. We could reasonably presume that transformation of Hamoun into arid country, like their surrounding areas, was mainly caused by irrigated agriculture expansion since the 1970s (represent as bright red patches on satellite images, mainly wheat and barley), coupled with one of the worst droughts ever witnessed in Central Asia in 1999-2001 period. The wetlands have been replaced mostly by lifeless salt flats and decaying reed stands. The wildlife, the towns, the fisheries, and the agriculture that once surrounded the Hamoun have all fallen away, giving rise to a wasteland. Winds that were once cooled by the waters of the wetlands now drifting dust, sand, and salt from the dried lakebeds onto the surrounding villages, and these sand drifts have submerged nearly 100 villages beneath dunes in a landscape reminiscent of the Aral Sea disaster. Most of the crops have been reduced to dustbowl conditions, livestock herds have been decimated, and thriving fishery with an annual catch of around 12,000 tons has been wiped out. Many who had lived around the Hamoun for generations either moved away or lost everything. Local bird population disappeared and migratory birds no longer stop for lack of refuge, and wildlife that could not sustain themselves in the desert or make the long journey to another oasis died. The rest of the wetlands now give off the harsh glare of dried salt flats. The only relatively large bodies of standing water are ChƒÅh-Nƒ´meh IV reservoir maintained for drinking water.

Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary. 17th edition. Cambridge UP, 2006. is an English mock-heroic narrative poem from the 17th century written by Samuel Butler. Purpose First Collected edition of Hudibras by Samuel Butler, 1674‚Äì1678 The work is a satirical polemic upon Roundheads, Puritans, Presbyterians and many of the other factions involved in the English Civil War. The work was begun, according to the title page, during the civil war and published in three parts in 1663, 1664 and 1678, with the first edition encompassing all three parts in 1684.Cox, Michael, editor, The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2004, The Mercurius Aulicus (an early newspaper of the time) reported an unauthorised edition of the first part was already in print in early 1662. Published only four years after Charles II had been restored to the throne and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell being completely over, the poem found an appreciative audience. The satire is not balanced as Butler was fiercely royalist and only the parliamentarian side are singled out for ridicule. Butler also uses the work to parody some of the dreadful poetry of the time. The epic tells the story of Sir Hudibras, a knight errant who is described dramatically and with laudatory praise that is so thickly applied as to be absurd, revealing the conceited and arrogant person visible beneath. He is praised for his knowledge of logic, despite appearing stupid throughout, but it is his religious fervour which is mainly attacked: His squire, Ralpho, is of a similar stamp but makes no claim to great learning, knowing all there is to know from his religion or \\"new-light\\", as he calls it. Butler satirises the competing factions at the time of the Protectorate by the constant bickering of these two principal characters whose religious opinions should unite them. These are fawning but barbed portraits and are thought to represent personalities of the times but the actual analogues are, now as then, debatable. \\"A Key to Hudibras\\" printed with one of the work's editions (1709) and ascribed to Roger L'Estrange names Sir Samuel Luke as the model for Hudibras. Certainly, the mention of Mamaluke in the poem makes this possible, although Butler suggests Hudibras is from the West Country, making Henry Rosewell a candidate. The witchfinder Matthew Hopkins, John Desborough, parliamentarian general, and William Prynne, lawyer, all make appearances, and the character of Sidrophel is variously seen as either William Lilly or Paul Neale. Structure Butler is clearly influenced by Rabelais and particularly Cervantes' Don Quixote. But whereas in Cervantes, the noble knight although being mocked is supposed to draw readers' sympathies, Hudibras is offered nothing but derision. The title comes from the name of a knight in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene who is described as \\"not so good of deeds as great of name\\" and \\"more huge in strength than wise in work\\". Spenser in turn probably got the name from the legendary king of the Britons, Rud Hud Hudibras. Hudibras was written in an iambic tetrameter in closed couplets, with surprising feminine rhymes. The dramatic meter portends tales of dramatic deeds, but the subject matter and the unusual rhymes undercut its importance. This verse form is now referred to as Hudibrastic. On in no the following from the opening of the poem, where the English Civil War is described thus: The work was published in three parts, each divided into three cantos with some additional heroic epistles. It is possible that a fourth part was planned, which would have given the work twelve parts in imitation of Virgil's Aeneid. Plot Hudibras Sallies Forth by William Hogarth The knight and his squire sally forth and come upon some people bear-baiting. After deciding that this is anti-Christian they attack the baiters and capture one after defeating the bear. The defeated group of bear-baiters then rallies and renews the attack, capturing the knight and his squire. While in the stocks the pair argue on religion. The second part describes how the knight's imprisoned condition is reported by Fame to a widow Hudibras has been wooing, who then comes to see him. With a captive audience, she complains that he does not really love her and he ends up promising to flagellate himself if she frees him. Once free he regrets his promise and debates with Ralpho how to avoid his fate, with Ralpho suggesting that oath breaking is next to saintliness: Hudibras then tries to convince Ralpho of the nobility of accepting the beating in his stead but he declines the offer. They are interrupted by a skimmington, a procession where women are celebrated and men made fools. After haranguing the crowd for their lewdness, the knight is pelted with rotten eggs and chased away. He decides to visit an astrologer, Sidrophel, to ask him how he should woo the widow but they get into an argument and after a fight the knight and squire run off in different directions believing they have killed Sidrophel. The third part was published 14 years after the first two and is considerably different from the first parts. It picks up from where the second left off with Hudibras going to the widow's house to explain the details of the whipping he had promised to give himself but Ralpho had got there first and told her what had actually happened. Suddenly a group rushes in and gives him a beating and supposing them to be spirits from Sidrophel, rather than hired by the widow, confesses his sins and by extension the sins of the Puritans. Hudibras then visits a lawyer--the profession Butler trained in and one he is well able to satirise-- who convinces him to write a letter to the widow. The poem ends with their exchange of letters in which the knight's arguments are rebuffed by the widow. Before the visit to the lawyer there is a digression of an entire canto in which much fun is had at the events after Oliver Cromwell's death. The succession of his son Richard Cromwell and the squabbles of factions such as the Fifth Monarchists are told with no veil of fiction and no mention of Sir Hudibras. Significance Hudibras was an extremely popular work with pirate copies and a spurious second part being issued before Butler could produce his genuine second part in 1664. It was highly praised with Voltaire in his Letters on the English saying \\"I never found so much wit in one single book\\". One reader though was distinctly unimpressed. On 26 December 1662 Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he bought Hudibras, but, despite its being extremely popular at the time, he admitted finding no humour in it and selling it the same day. Two months later he bought it again to try to find what he was missing. He still found nothing funny about it, due to his finding its treatment of Puritans too vicious and being insensitive to the humour of the rhymes. The mock heroic epic and its jaunty verse form known as Hudibrastic became the standard of satire for some time after that with at least twenty- seven direct imitations being produced. Of the most famous was Ned Ward and his Hudibras Redivivus with Samuel Wesley father of John Wesley emulating the work. A half century after the last part was written a new edition was published in 1727, with engraved illustrations by William Hogarth, who later became one of the foremost artists of the day. The work remained popular for several centuries as a warning against the zealotry during the Civil War period of English history although it has lately gone out of fashion. In his poem, Butler coined the phrase \\"Spare the rod and spoil the child,\\" probably a modification of a Biblical injunction about child-rearing given in Book of Proverbs: \\"He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes\\" (Proverbs 13:24). In the context of Hudibras the phrase is a bawdy metaphor suggesting the best way to curtail amorous passions or, through double entendre, to prevent conception: One couplet was widely quoted through the end of the nineteenth century as an illustration of the fact that some people just want action and excitement, never mind what: References  External links   * e-text of Hudibras Category:1660s poems Category:English poems Category:Narrative poems Category:English Civil War fiction Category:Mock-heroic English poems Category:Religious parodies and satires ","title":"Hudibras"},{"id":"2176809","text":"John C. Gaeta (born 1965) is a designer and inventor best known for his work on the Matrix film trilogy, where he advanced methods and formats known as Bullet Time, Volumetric Cinematography and Universal Capture (UCAP). He is also known for exploring emergent and expressive new media platforms such as Photo Anime, NUI, HoloCinema and the Magicverse. Career John Gaeta was born in New York City and grew up in Shoreham, Long Island. He eventually grew an interest in photography and the films of Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. He entered New York University's Tisch School of the Arts to study film, and acquired a BFA degree with honors in 1989. He was introduced to the industry as a staff production assistant for the Saturday Night Live film unit, as well as doing camera and lighting work for a variety of media types and makers.\\"Matrix2: Bullet Time was just the beginning. F/x guru John Gaeta reinvents cinematography with The Matrix Reloaded.\\" (Wired, May 2003) Some of these early work experiences included holography with Jason Sapan, stop-motion animation with Peter Wallach, motion control with Bran Ferren, nature documentary, filming birdlife for National Geographic Explorer, timelapse and experimental photography in Namibia, Africa on Miramax's first feature, Dust Devil. A few years later, Gaeta heard from a friend that visual effects innovator Douglas Trumbull was founding a new company in Massachusetts and needed technicians based on the East Coast. Gaeta went on to be drafted into the camera department of the newly formed Trumbull Company, where he was introduced and educated in a spectrum of innovative film formats such as 48fps VistaVision, 70mm Showscan, IMAX, OMNIMAX and stereo CGI, to create the ambitious simulator Back to the Future: The Ride for Universal Parks & Resorts. Following this special venue period (1991‚Äì1994), Gaeta became interested in applying computer-generated animation as a means of visualizing content and visual effects concepts for directors as well as for custom camera-path planning. This led to experimentation with emerging forms of space analysis including photogrammetry, stereo and laser radar. Trumbull Company was renamed Mass Illusion and started feature film effects for movies. After co-supervising development for 3-D paint effect stylizations and LIDAR laser scanning(Reality Capture) for What Dreams May Come (1998 Visual Effects Oscar winner), Gaeta began his first solo effects supervision project for The Wachowskis' science fiction film, The Matrix. Designing and testing The Matrix bullet time effects began in early 1996. This work directly overlapped R&D; for What Dreams May Come. Shortly after the release of the original Matrix in 1999, Gaeta continued his exploration of content design through CGI visualization with longtime colleague Kim Libreri (Lucasfilm, Current CTO of Epic Games) by developing fully \\"virtual\\" scene and action layouts for use in realtime interactive composition. Scenes ran on the GS Cube, a machine consisting of 16 parallel processors each based on a PlayStation 2 and rendering at, then groundbreaking, HD resolution. The research was demonstrated at SIGGRAPH 2000. Later, he partnered with colleague Rudy Poat (Microsoft, Amazon VR), returning to real time cinema experimentation by inserting, possibly the first ever, real time composed and rendered, full resolution/2k content into a theatrically released movie, Trapped Ashes. In 2000, Gaeta was brought on as the senior visual effects supervisor to complete the Matrix trilogy including The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. This pair of films were created in parallel and featured over 2000 visual effects shots. Many photographed and post processed at a custom built complex called ESC, located at the Alameda Naval Base near San Francisco. Overall conceptual design as well as research and development was initiated for the final two installments in January 2000. There were a wide range of effects content from large-scale man vs. machine-type battles, to anime-styled hyper- real moments. The centerpiece innovations and new methodologies presented through the Matrix universe was the creation of \\"Virtual Cinematography\\" and \\"Virtual Effects,\\" phrases coined by Gaeta in 1999 and 2000.\\"'The Matrix' Revealed: An Interview with John Gaeta\\" (VFXPro, March 9, 2004) In fully synthetic scenes within The Matrix sequels, all aspects including principal characters, elaborate performances, dynamic events, and deep surrounding scenery were computer generated by way of customized \\"image based\\" rendering techniques. Content components were constructed from \\"universal capture\\" sources based upon real actors, production design and cinematography, in a \\"sample cinema\\" type process more analogous to producing virtual reality than to film making. Impact, evolution and expansion of these once emergent content forms can be seen in later breakthrough films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Avatar as well as ongoing interactive research happening in games and military simulation. The years 2005‚Äì2008 marked a deepening of the pursuit of sample cinema with new ground covered in the feature Speed Racer. The advent of a new genre type, dubbed \\"Photo Anime\\", was the centerpiece of a retro-modern universe in which optimistic pop art design (\\"Poptimisitic\\") threaded through dramatic collage based editing and motion graphic heavy kung fu car action. Inspired in part by the production attitude of Sin City, the expressive animated cinema of Hayao Miyazaki and Andy Warhol, the Wachowskis focused Gaeta's sensibilities once more toward new forms of post cinematography, deploying end to end high definition pipelines, comprehensive greenscreen/virtual set processes, fully computer generated race worlds, \\"2 and 1/2 D\\" layering methodologies, \\"faux lensing\\" as applied to VR location photography (360 degree spherical capture) and \\"techno color\\" in pursuit of a different movie experience. In addition to visual effects design for the film, Gaeta was additionally enlisted to creatively produce the Wii game counterpart.CGSociety - John Gaeta Since 2000, Gaeta has been an avid proponent of image based universal capture, also known as volumetric capture and deploying it within next generation of immersive entertainment. In 2009 he had formed a new type of development company, FLOAT (hybrid) and was its acting Chief Creative Officer from 2009-2012. Float (hybrid) specializes in discovering and developing intuitive \\"Natural and Human Interfaces\\" in an effort to change the way people engage, relate to and interact with live generated entertainment. Working directly with the future media labs at Microsoft that birthed the prototype technology that led to the Kinect and Hololens, his focus was on discovering new forms of ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù within emergent \\"Natural User Interface\\" (NUI) paradigms. First of kind advancements were made toward intuitive, multi modal, full body gesture based navigation of characters through spatially complex and virtually tactile(reactive) worlds. Nuiscopic (Natural User Vision) and Nuvie (NU Movie, Natural User Movie) were terms Gaeta coined during this period to describe a new form of gesture and spatial proximity driven real time perspective control and a creative target for it: interactive and navigable storytelling. Float prototypes were often conducted in connected ‚Äúliving room labs\\" or special venues and often utilized sensors, capture and tracking technologies, proto mobile device hardware, immersive projection, virtual reality hmds (military, pre oculus/vive), augmented and blended reality proto tech. In late 2012, at the onset of Walt Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, John Gaeta was invited to join at the invitation of Kathleen Kennedy(President of Lucasfilm) to help catalyze next generation creative innovation. He would do so in collaboration with Rick Carter (Academy Award-winning Production Designer), Kiri Hart (SVP Development, Head of Story Group), Doug Chiang (SVP Head of Creative), Kim Libreri (Chief Strategy Officer) and the remarkable talent of Industrial Light and Magic during the next contemporary expansion of Star Wars. John Gaeta is a founding member and Executive Creative Director of Lucasfilm's new Immersive Entertainment division: ILMxLAB, a joint venture between the Lucasfilm Story Group, Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound. ILMxLAB was launched in 2015 with a mission to develop, produce and release premium Star Wars Immersive Entertainment within emergent platforms. Other founding members include Vicki Dobbs Beck(Executive in Charge) and Rob Bredow(Lucasfilm CTO). State of the art formats under the umbrella of \\"Immersive Entertainment\\" include Real Time and Interactive Cinema, HoloCinema (Holographic Cinema), Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Theme Parks 2.0, and other Experimental Platforms. Part lab, part content creator, ILMxLAB also has connections to Disney Imagineering, Disney Research, Disney Corporate / Innovation and Disney Studios. During this time, ILMxLAB developed a multitude of advanced Star Wars based prototypes that would go on to become releasable products including the VOID experience titled Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire as well as the development of a VR Story Series titled Vader Immortal. Vader Immortal's original premise and innovative format was first conceived of by David Goyer and John Gaeta under the guidance of Lucasfilm/Star Wars head of Story, Kiri Heart. Gaeta would leave Lucasfilm to take on a new role at Magic Leap before Vader Immortal was greenlit and published by Facebook Oculus with Goyer acting as its showrunner/writer and with ILMXLAB in charge of formal development and execution. Both of these accomplishments mark a milestone for Lucasfilm/Disney as it evolved \\"immersive entertainment\\" from incubation labs to producing first of kind products for mainstream media audiences. In October 2017, as a direct report to CEO Rony Abovitz, John Gaeta took on the executive role of SVP of Creative Strategy at Magic Leap with a mission focus to collaboratively conceive and advise corporate direction on mid term emergent spatial computing, spatial web, massive xr platform strategies and premium content/worlds. Some areas included multi platform \\"co presence\\" formats, giga-smart city scaled holo(hunger games like xr mmo) interfaces, high fidelity \\"cinematic reality\\" for persistent living immersive content layers, premium xr world creative ip development and the advanced envisioning of The Magicverse. The latter initiative was first unveiled by Neal Stephensen(Snowcrash Author), Rony Abovitz and John Gaeta at Magic Leap's 2018 conference. Magicverse envisioning is conducted through a special projects/moonshot division he initiated called IPL which produces strategic analysis, concept, visualization/simulation and leading edge prototypes which depict future use cases, experimental interface and compelling human experiences.

The ELM was developed by Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo in 1980. The model aims to explain different ways of processing stimuli, why they are used, and their outcomes on attitude change. The ELM proposes two major routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route. * Under the central route, persuasion will likely result from a person's careful and thoughtful consideration of the true merits of the information presented in support of an advocacy. The central route involves a high level of message elaboration in which a great amount of cognition about the arguments are generated by the individual receiving the message. The results of attitude change will be relatively enduring, resistant, and predictive of behavior. * On the other hand, under the peripheral route, persuasion results from a person's association with positive or negative cues in the stimulus or making a simple inference about the merits of the advocated position. The cues received by the individual under the peripheral route are generally unrelated to the logical quality of the stimulus. These cues will involve factors such as the credibility or attractiveness of the sources of the message, or the production quality of the message. The likelihood of elaboration will be determined by an individual's motivation and ability to evaluate the argument being presented.Examples: Routes of ELM (central and peripheral) Origin Elaboration likelihood model is a general theory of attitude change. According to the theory's developers Richard E. Petty and John T. Cacioppo, they intended to provide a general \\"framework for organizing, categorizing, and understanding the basic processes underlying the effectiveness of persuasive communications\\". The study of attitudes and persuasion began as the central focus of social psychology, featured in the work of psychologists Gordon Allport (1935) and Edward Alsworth Ross (1908). Allport described attitudes as \\"the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology\\". Considerable research was devoted to the study of attitudes and persuasion from the 1930s through the late 1970s. These studies embarked on various relevant issues regarding attitudes and persuasion, such as the consistency between attitudes and behaviors and the processes underlying attitude/behavior correspondence. However, Petty and Cacioppo noticed a major problem facing attitude and persuasion researchers to the effect that there was minimal agreement regarding \\"if, when, and how the traditional source, message, recipient, and channel variables affected attitude change\\". Noticing this problem, Petty and Cacioppo developed the elaboration likelihood model as their attempt to account for the differential persistence of communication-induced attitude change. Petty and Cacioppo suggested that different empirical findings and theories on attitude persistence could be viewed as stressing one of two routes to persuasion which they presented in their elaboration likelihood model. Routes The elaboration likelihood model proposes two distinct routes for information processing: a central route and a peripheral route. The ELM holds that there are numerous specific processes of change on the \\"elaboration continuum\\" ranging from low to high. When the operation processes at the low end of the continuum determine attitudes, persuasion follows the peripheral route. When the operation processes at the high end of the continuum determine attitudes, persuasion follows the central route. =Central route= ELM diagram The central route is used when the message recipient has the motivation as well as the ability to think about the message and its topic. When people process information centrally, the cognitive responses, or elaborations, will be much more relevant to the information, whereas when processing peripherally, the individual may rely on heuristics and other rules of thumb when elaborating on a message. Being at the high end of the elaboration continuum, people assess object-relevant information in relation to schemas that they already possess, and arrive at a reasoned attitude that is supported by information. It is important to consider two types of factors that influence how and how much one will elaborate on a persuasive message. The first are the factors that influence our motivation to elaborate, and the second are the factors that influence our ability to elaborate. Motivation to process the message may be determined by a personal interest in the subject of the message, or individual factors like the need for cognition. However, if the message recipient has a strong, negative attitude toward the position proposed by the message, a boomerang effect (an opposite effect) is likely to occur. That is, they will resist the message and may move away from the proposed position.Griffin, E. (2012). In addition, there are different variables that a persuader can use to affect an individual‚Äôs ability to process a message (commonly used factors are the presence or absence of distractions, background knowledge of the topic, and the comprehensibility of the message or how easy it is to understand) that can enhance or reduce the amount of critical thinking that one would use to create elaborations from the message being presented. A First Look at Communication Theory, 8th ed. McGraw-Hill: New York, 205-207. Two advantages of the central route are that attitude changes tend to last longer and are more predictive of behavior than the changes from the peripheral route. Overall, as people‚Äôs motivation and ability to process the message and develop elaborations decreases, the peripheral cues present in the situation become more important in their processing of the message. =Peripheral route= The peripheral route is used when the message recipient has little or no interest in the subject and/or has a lesser ability to process the message. Being at the low end of the elaboration continuum, recipients do not examine the information as thoroughly. With the peripheral route, they are more likely to rely on general impressions (e.g. \\"this feels right/good\\"), early parts of the message, their own mood, positive and negative cues of the persuasion context, etc. Because people are \\"cognitive misers,\\" looking to reduce mental effort, they often use the peripheral route and thus rely on heuristics (mental shortcuts) when processing information. When an individual is not motivated to centrally process an issue because they lack interest in it, or if the individual does not have the cognitive ability to centrally process the issue, then these heuristics can be quite persuasive. Robert Cialdini's Principles of Social Influence (1984), which include commitment, social proof, scarcity, reciprocation, authority, as well as liking the person who is persuading you, are some examples of frequently used heuristics. In addition, credibility can also be used as a heuristic in peripheral thinking because when a speaker is seen as having a higher credibility, then the listener may be more likely to believe the message. Credibility is a low-effort and somewhat reliable way to give us an answer of what to decide and/or believe without having to put in much work to think it through. Peripheral route processing involves a low level of elaboration. The user isn‚Äôt scrutinizing the message for its effectiveness. If these peripheral influences go completely unnoticed, the message recipient is likely to maintain their previous attitude towards the message. Otherwise, the individual will temporarily change his attitude towards it. This attitude change can be long-lasting, although durable change is less likely to occur than it is with the central route.Chaiken & Trope (Eds.)(1999) Determinants of route The two most influential factors that affect which processing route an individual uses are motivation (the desire to process the message; see Petty and Cacioppo, 1979) and ability (the capability for critical evaluation; see Petty, Wells and Brock, 1976). The extent of motivation is in turn affected by attitude and personal relevance. Individuals' ability for elaboration is affected by distractions, their cognitive busyness (the extent to which their cognitive processes are engaged by multiple tasks), and their overall knowledge. = Motivation = Attitudes towards a message can affect motivation. Drawing from cognitive dissonance theory, when people are presented with new information (a message) that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values, they will be motivated to eliminate the dissonance, in order to remain at peace with their own thoughts. For instance, people who want to believe that they will be academically successful may recall more of their past academic successes than their failures. They may also use their world knowledge to construct new theories about how their particular personality traits may predispose them to academic success (Kunda, 1987). If they succeed in accessing and constructing appropriate beliefs, they may feel justified in concluding that they will be academically successful, not realizing that they also possess knowledge that could be used to support the opposite conclusion. Motivation and ability Personal relevance can also affect an individual's degree of motivation. For instance, undergraduate students were told of a new exam policy that would take effect either one or ten years later. The proposal of the new exam policy was either supported by strong or weak arguments. Those students who were going to personally be affected by this change would think more about the issue than those students who were not going to be personally affected. An additional factor that affects degree of motivation is an individual's need for cognition. Individuals who take greater pleasure in thinking than others tend to engage in more effortful thinking because of its intrinsic enjoyment for them, regardless of the importance of the issue to them or the need to be correct. = Ability = Ability includes the availability of cognitive resources (for instance, the absence of time pressures or distractions) and the relevant knowledge needed to examine arguments. Distractions (for instance, noise in a library where a person is trying to read a journal article) can decrease a person's ability to process a message. Cognitive busyness, which can also serve as a distraction, limits the cognitive resources otherwise available for the task at hand (assessing a message). Another factor of ability is familiarity with the relevant subject. Though they might not be distracted nor cognitively busy, their insufficiency in knowledge can hinder people's engagement in deep thinking. = Opportunity = Some psychologists lump opportunity in with Ability as it primarily relates to the time available to the individual to make a decision. The popular train of thought today is that this is a category of its own. Factors related to ability to think includes: time pressure, message repetition, distraction, knowledge, fatigue, social pressure, etc. Message repetition enables more argument scrutiny. If the argument is strong, repetition leads to more change in attitude. For example, in marketing research, advertising leads to a favorable brand attitude as long as the arguments are strong and tedium is not induced. However, it is noticeable that repetition does not always lead to more attitude change. The effect of repetition also depends on other factors such as content of argument, and previous knowledge and attitude. When Distraction is high, elaboration is lower due to limited mental power. In this case, people are less influenced by the quality of the argument in a persuasive message. Rather, they focus on simple source cues. Keeping other factors constant, a stronger argument leads to more attitude change when distraction is low; and a weak argument could lead to more attitude change when distraction is high. =Core ideas= There are four core ideas to the ELM. # The ELM argues that when a person encounters some form of communication, they can process this communication with varying levels of thought (elaboration), ranging from a low degree of thought (low elaboration) to a high degree of thought (high elaboration). Factors that contribute to elaboration includes different motivations, abilities, opportunities, etc. # The ELM predicts that there are a variety of psychological processes of change that operate to varying degrees as a function of a person's level of elaboration. On the lower end of the continuum are the processes that require relatively little thought, including classical conditioning and mere exposure. On the higher end of the continuum are processes that require relatively more thought, including expectancy-value and cognitive response processes. When lower elaboration processes predominate, a person is said to be using the peripheral route, which is contrasted with the central route, involving the operation of predominantly high elaboration processes. # The ELM predicts that the degree of thought used in a persuasion context determines how consequential the resultant attitude becomes. Attitudes formed via high- thought, central-route processes will tend to persist over time, resist persuasion, and be influential in guiding other judgments and behaviors to a greater extent that attitudes formed through low-thought, peripheral-route processes. # The ELM also predicts that any given variable can have multiple roles in persuasion, including acting as a cue to judgment or as an influence on the direction of thought about a message. The ELM holds that the specific role by which a variable operates is determined by the extent of elaboration. = Assumptions = One of the main assumptions of the ELM is that the attitudes formed through the central route rather than the peripheral route are stronger and more difficult to change.Petty R. and Cacioppo J. \\"Communication and persuasion: central and peripheral routes to attitude change.\\" Springer-Verlag, New York. This means that when the central route is taken (involving high-elaboration thought in which all information is being carefully analyzed), the attitudes formed become more stable and less susceptible to counter-persuasion, whereas when the peripheral route is taken (involving low-elaboration thought based on heuristics and shortcuts to establish an attitude) short-term attitude change is more likely to occur. = Variables = A variable is essentially anything that can increase or decrease the persuasiveness of a message. Motivation (desire to process the message), ability (capability for critical evaluation), attractiveness, mood and expertise are just a few examples of variables that can influence persuasiveness. Variables also have different roles, for example, they may have a positive effect as a cue, but a negative effect if it ends up decreasing thought about a strong message. Under high elaboration, a given variable (e.g., expertise) can serve as an argument (e.g., \\"If Einstein agrees with the theory of relativity, then this is a strong reason for me to as well\\") or a biasing factor (e.g., \\"If an expert agrees with this position it is probably good, so let me see who else agrees with this conclusion\\"), at the expense of contradicting information. Under low-elaboration conditions, a variable may act as a peripheral cue (e.g., the belief that \\"experts are always right\\"). While this is similar to the Einstein example above, this is a shortcut which (unlike the Einstein example) does not require thought. Under moderate elaboration, a variable may direct the extent of information processing (e.g., \\"If an expert agrees with this position, I should really listen to what (s)he has to say\\"). Recent adaptations of the ELM have added a role for variables: to affect the extent to which a person trusts their thoughts in response to a message (self-validation role). A person may think, \\"If an expert presented this information, it is probably correct, and thus I can trust that my reactions to it are informative with respect to my attitude.\\" This role, because of its metacognitive nature, only occurs in high-elaboration conditions. Scholars have been studying different variables in this model in difference context. For example, in \\"The Elaboration Likelihood Model: Limitations and Extensions in Marketing\\", Bitner et al. proposed that motivation and ability are under an interlaced influence of situational variables, person variables, and product categories variables. =Consequences= For an individual intent on forming long-lasting beliefs on topics, the central route is advantageous by the fact that arguments are scrutinized intensely and that information is unlikely to be overlooked. However, this route uses a considerable amount of energy, time, and mental effort. It is not worthwhile to exert considerable mental effort to achieve correctness in all situations and people do not always have the requisite knowledge, time, or opportunity to thoughtfully assess the merits of a proposal. For those, the use of the peripheral route excels at saving energy, time, and mental effort. This is particularly advantageous in situations in which one must make a decision within a small time constraint. On the other hand, the peripheral route is prone to errors in judgment, at least in attributing reasons for behaviors. Also, people are persuaded in peripheral routes based on import cues such as credibility of the information source. However, sleeper effect could influence the strength of persuasion. It is noteworthy that high elaboration does not necessarily leads to attitude change. Resistance to persuasion occurs when someone feels his/her freedom to perform a certain behavior is threatened. A famous study on reaction is conducted by Pennebaker and Sanders in 1976. The experimenters placed placard in campus toilets to discourage graffiti. The result of experiment suggests the amount of graffiti written on the threatening placards was significantly positively related to both authority and threat level. Findings are interpreted as reflecting reactance arousal. In addition, inoculation theory must also be taken into account when it comes to persuasion. Applications Researchers have applied the elaboration likelihood model to many fields, including advertising, marketing, consumer behavior and health care, just to name a few. =In advertising and marketing= Advertising The elaboration likelihood model can be applied to advertising and marketing. In 1983, Petty, Cacioppo and Schumann conducted a study to examine source effects in advertising. It was a product advertisement about a new disposable razor. The authors purposefully made one group of subjects highly involved with the product, by telling them the product would be test marketed soon in the local area and by the end of the experiment they would be given a chance to get a disposable razor. Whereas, the authors made another group of subjects have low involvement with the product by telling them that the product would be test marketed in a distant city and by the end of the experiment they would have the chance to get a toothpaste. In addition to varying involvement, the authors also varied source and message characteristics by showing a group of the subjects ads featuring popular athletes, whereas showing other subjects ads featuring average citizens; showing some subjects ads with strong arguments and others ads with weak arguments. This experiment shows that when the elaboration likelihood was low, featuring famous athletes in the advertisement would lead to more favorable product attitudes, regardless of the strength of the product attributes presented. Whereas when elaboration likelihood was high, only the argument strength would manipulate affected attitudes. Lee et al. supported the studies on that product involvement strengthens the effects of \\"endorser‚Äìproduct congruence on consumer responses\\" when the endorsers expertise is well related with product to create source credibility. Lee's finding also helps to understand celebrity endorsement as not only a peripheral cue but also a motivation for central route. Later in 1985, Bitner, Mary J., and Carl Obermiller expand this model theoretically in the field of marketing. They proposed in the marketing context, the determinant of routes is more complex, involving variables of situation, person, and product categories. Trampe et al. (2010) also discovered that product relevance is directional proportional to the attractiveness. It is widely acknowledged that effects of ads are not only limited to the information contained in the ad alone but are also a function of the different appeals used in the ads (like use celebrities or non-celebrities as endorsers). In a study conducted by Rollins and Bhutada in 2013, ELM theory was the framework used to understand and evaluate the underlying mechanisms describing the relationships between endorser type, disease state involvement and consumer response to direct-to-consumer advertisements (DTCA). The finding showed while endorser type did not significantly affect consumer attitudes, behavioral intentions and information search behavior; level of disease state involvement, though, did. More highly involved consumers had more positive attitudes, behavioral intentions and greater information search behavior.  Caveat  * However, when looking into advertising among young people, Te'eni-Harari et al. found out that in contradistinction to adults, ELM doesn't hold true for the young. Instead of two information processing routes, young people are less influenced by motivation and ability variables, hence only one route. Their findings also indicate young people are representative of the less intellectually oriented population at large, who probably only have one route to process information. * Although using peripheral cues is a persuasive choice, advertisers need to be extremely careful in addressing some issues to avoid controversy, such as using sacred symbols as peripheral cues in advertising. =In healthcare= Healthcare Recent research has been conducted to apply the ELM to the healthcare field. In 2009, Angst and Agarwal published a research article, \\"Adoption of Electronic Health Records in the Presence of Privacy Concerns: the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Individual Persuasion\\". This research studies electronic health records (EHRs), (an individual's) concern for information privacy (CFIP) and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). The two researchers aimed to investigate the question, \\"Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?\\" Since the ELM model provides an understanding how to influence attitudes, the said model could be leveraged to alter perceptions and attitudes regarding adoption and adaptation of change. Findings of the research included: * \\"Issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.\\" * \\"Likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.\\" * \\"An individual's CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.\\" * \\"Even people who have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.\\" = In e-commerce = Chen and Lee conducted a study about online shopping persuasion by applying the elaboration likelihood model back to 2008. In this study, how online shopping influences consumers' beliefs and perceived values on attitude and approach behavior were examined. \\"Twenty cosmetics and 20 hotel websites were selected for participants to randomly link to and read, and the students were then asked to fill in a 48-item questionnaire via the internet. It was found that when consumers have higher levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness, central route website contents would be more favorable for eliciting utilitarian shopping value; whereas when consumers have higher levels of emotional stability, openness, and extraversion, peripheral route website contents would be more critical in facilitating experiential and hedonic shopping value\\", Chen explained. In 2009, another study about the effects of consumer skepticism on online shopping was conducted by Sher and Lee. Data on young customers' attitudes about a product were acquired through an online experiment with 278 college students, and two findings emerged after analysis. First, highly skeptical consumers tend to stick with their original impression than been influenced by other factors (Central Route); which means, they are biased against certain types of information and indifferent to the message quality. Second, consumers with low skepticism tend to adopt the peripheral route in forming attitude; that is, they are more persuaded by online review quantity. Lee indicated, \\"these findings contribute to the ELM research literature by considering a potentially important personality factor in the ELM framework\\". Other studies applied ELM in e-commerce and internet related fields are listed below for your additional references: * How does web personalization affect users attitudes and behaviors online? * An eye-tracking study of online shopping to understand how customers use ELM in their e-commerce experience. * Using an elaboration likelihood approach to better understand the persuasiveness of website privacy assurance cues for online consumers. * Multichannel retailing's use of central and peripheral routes through Internet and cross-channel platforms. * Using ELM and signaling theory to analyze Internet recruitment. = In media = Media In order to reduce youth smoking by developing improved methods to communicate with higher risk youth, Flynn and his colleagues conducted a study in 2013, exploring the potential of smoking prevention messages on TV based on the ELM. \\"Structured evaluations of 12 smoking prevention messages based on three strategies derived from the ELM were conducted in classroom settings among a diverse sample of non-smoking middle school students in three states. Students categorized as likely to have higher involvement in a decision to initiate cigarette smoking, are reported relatively high ratings on a cognitive processing indicator for messages focused on factual arguments about negative consequences of smoking than for messages with fewer or no direct arguments. Message appeal ratings did not show greater preference for this message type among higher involved versus lower involved students. Ratings from students reporting lower academic achievement suggested difficulty processing factual information presented in these messages. The ELM may provide a useful strategy for reaching adolescents at risk for smoking initiation, but particular attention should be focused on lower academic achievers to ensure that messages are appropriate for them.\\" Another research directed by Boyce and Kuijer was focusing on media body ideal images triggers food intake among restrained eaters based on ELM. Their hypotheses were based on restraint theory and the ELM. From the research, they found participants' attention (advertent/inadvertent) toward the images was manipulated. Although restrained eaters' weight satisfaction was not significantly affected by either media exposure condition, advertent (but not inadvertent) media exposure triggered restrained eaters' eating. These results suggest that teaching restrained eaters how to pay less attention to media body ideal images might be an effective strategy in media‚Äìliterary interventions. With the development of the internet and the emerging new media, L. G. Pee (2012) has conduct interesting research on the influence of trust on social media using the ELM theory. The findings resulted that source credibility, the majority influence, and information quality has strong effect on the trust for users. = In politics = The ELM has been studied with regard to its usefulness in politics and voting specifically. The work of Terry Chmielewski (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire) found \\"moderate-to-strong support for the applicability of E-L-M to voting.\\" This finding came through thehttps://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid;=1b661986-a2e3-4770-bcd9-427a73be2f73%40sdc- v-sessmgr03 study of voters in the 2004 and 2008 elections for President of the United States. Continuing on that thread, the work of Wood and Herbst https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalie_Wood4/publication/228457399_Political_star_power_and_political_parties_does_celebrity_endorsement_win_first- time_votes/links/00b7d52ea72a574e76000000/Political-star-power-and-political- parties-does-celebrity-endorsement-win-first-time-votes.pdffound that, \\"family and significant others were more influential than celebrities in engendering support for a political candidate.\\" This indicates that peripheral route processes may have some influence on some voters; however, family and friends are likely to be more influential than those who do not have a personal connection to specific voters. Hans-Joachim Mosler applied ELM to study if and how a minority can persuade the majority to change its opinion. The study used Agent-based social simulation. There were 5 agents. 3 (or 4) of whom held a neutral opinion on some abstract topic, while the other 2 (or 1) held a different opinion. In addition, there were differences between the agents regarding their argument quality and peripheral cues. The simulation was done in rounds. In each round, one of the agents had an opportunity to influence the other agents. The level of influence was determined by either the argument strength (if the central route was taken) or the peripheral cues (if the peripheral route was taken). After 20 rounds of persuasion, the distance between the majority's original opinion to its new opinion was studied. It was found that, the peripheral cues of the minority were more important than the argument quality. I.e, a minority with strong arguments but negative cues (e.g., different skin-color or bad reputation) did not succeed in convincing the majority, while a minority with weak arguments and positive cues (e.g., appearance or reputation) did succeed. The results depend also on the level of personal relevance ‚Äì how much the topic is important to the majority and to the minority. Social Media impact on politics ELM has been utilized to look at the effect of social media on politics. One study on the effect of Twitter on politics, by Wu, Wong, Deng, and Chang, found that certain types of tweets (1 central route, 1 peripheral route) are most effective in political persuasion. Informative tweets (central) have been shown to produce a consistent impact on opinion convergence. Affective tweets (peripheral) have been shown to be more inconsistent. In mental health counseling Mental health counseling Counseling and stigma One of the most common reasons why an individual does not attend counseling is because they are worried about the falling into a stigma (being considered crazy, or having serious ‚Äúissues‚Äù).Nelson, G. D., & Barbaro, M. B. (1985). Fighting the stigma: A unique approach to marketing mental health. Health Marketing Quarterly, 2, 89‚Äì101. This stigma‚Äîwhich was prevalent 30 years ago, still exists today. Fortunately, an implementation of the ELM can help increase the positive perceptions of counseling amongst the undergraduate student population. Students that repeatedly watched a video that explained the function and positive outcomes of mental health counseling demonstrated a significant and lasting change in their perception to counseling. Students who watched the video once or not at all maintained a relatively negative view towards counseling. Thus, repeated exposure towards the positive elements of counseling lead towards a greater elaboration and implementation of the central route to combat negative social stigma of counseling. Most negative intuitions exist within the realm of the peripheral route, and therefore to work against stigmas the general public needs to engage their central route of processing. Counselor credibility The more credible a counselor is perceived as, the more likely that counseling clients are to perceive the counselor‚Äôs advice as impactful. However, counselor credibility is strongly mediated by the degree to which the client understands the information conveyed by the counselor.Hu, B. (2013). Examining elaboration likelihood model in counseling context. Asian Journal Of Counselling, 20(1-2), 33-58. Therefore, it is extremely important that counseling clients feel that they understand their counselor. The use of metaphor is helpful for this. Metaphors require a deeper level of elaboration, thereby engaging the central route of processing. Kendall (2010)Kendall, W. A. (2010). Examining the persuasive effect of metaphor use in psychotherapy: An experimental test of contributing factors. Dissertation Abstracts International, 71, 3377. suggests using metaphor in counseling as a valid method towards helping clients understand the message/psychological knowledge conveyed by the client. When the client hears a metaphor that resonates with them, they are far more likely to trust and build positive rapport with the counselor.  Methodological considerations 177x177px In designing a test for the aforementioned model, it is necessary to determine the quality of an argument, i.e., whether it is viewed as strong or weak. If the argument is not seen as strong, then the results of persuasion will be inconsistent. A strong argument is defined by Petty and Cacioppo as \\"one containing arguments such that when subjects are instructed to think about the message, the thoughts they generate are fundamentally favorable.\\"Griffin E. A First Look at Communication Theory, 8th ed. McGraw- Hill, New York, p366 - 377. An argument that is universally viewed as weak will elicit unfavorable results, especially if the subject considers it under high elaboration, thus being the central route. Test arguments must be rated by ease of understanding, complexity and familiarity. To study either route of the elaboration likelihood model, the arguments must be designed for consistent results.Berkowitz L. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. Vol 19. Academic press, Orlando 1986 p132 - 134. Print. Also, when assessing persuasion of an argument, the influence of peripheral cues needs to be taken into consideration as cues can influence attitude even in the absence of argument processing. The extent or direction of message processing also needs to be taken into consideration when assessing persuasion, as variables can influence or bias thought by enabling or inhibiting the generation of a particular kind of thought in regard to the argument. \\"While the ELM theory continues to be widely cited and taught as one of the major cornerstones of persuasion, questions are raised concerning its relevance and validity in 21st century communication contexts.\\" Misinterpretions of the theory Some researchers have been criticized for misinterpreting the ELM. One such instance is Kruglanski and Thompson, who write that the processing of central or peripheral routes is determined by the type of information that affects message persuasion. For example, message variables are only influential when the central route is used and information like source variables is only influential when the peripheral route is used. In fact, the ELM does not make statements about types of information being related to routes. Rather, the key to the ELM is how any type of information will be used depending on central or peripheral routes, regardless of what that information is. For example, the central route may permit source variables to influence preference for certain language usage in the message (e.g. \\"beautiful\\") or validate a related product (e.g. cosmetics), while the peripheral route may only lead individuals to associate the \\"goodness\\" of source variables with the message. Theoretically, all of these could occur simultaneously. Thus, the distinction between central and peripheral routes is not the type of information being processed as those types can be applied to both routes, but rather how that information is processed and ultimately whether processing information in one way or the other will result in different attitudes. A second instance of misinterpretation is that processing of the central route solely involves thinking about the message content and not thoughts about the issue. Petty and Cacioppo (1981) stated \\"If the issue is very important to the person, but the person doesn't understand the arguments being presented in the message, or if no arguments are actually presented, then elaboration of arguments cannot occur.‚Ä¶Nevertheless, the person may still be able to think about the issue.\\" Therefore, issue-relevant thinking is still a part of the central route and is necessary for one to think about the message content. Lastly, a third instance of misinterpretation by Kruglanski and Thompson is the disregard for the quantitative dimension presented by the ELM and more focus on the qualitative dimension. This quantitative dimension is the peripheral route involves low- elaboration persuasion that is quantitatively different from the central route that involves high elaboration. With this difference the ELM also explains that low-elaboration persuasion processes are qualitatively different as well. It is seen as incorrect if the ELM focuses on a quantitative explanation over a qualitative one; however one of the ELM's key points is that elaboration can range from high to low which is not incorrect as data from experiments conducted by Petty (1997) as well as Petty and Wegener (1999) suggest that persuasion findings can be explained by a quantitative dimension without ever needing a qualitative one.  Issues concerning the ELM  In 2014, J. Kitchen et al. scrutinized the literatures of the ELM for the past 30 years. They came up with four major research areas that have received most significant criticism: = The descriptive nature of the model = The first critique concerns the model's initial development. Considering that the ELM was built upon previous empirical research and a diverse literature base to unify disparate ideas, the model is inherently descriptive because of the intuitive and conceptual assumptions underlying. For example, Choi and Salmon criticized Petty and Cacioppo's assumption that correct recall of a product led directly to high involvement. They proposed that high involvement is likely to be the result of other variations, for example the sample population; and the weak/strong arguments in one study are likely to result in different involvement characteristics in another study. = Continuum questions = The elaboration likelihood continuum ought to show that a human can undergo a natural progression from high involvement to low involvement with the corresponding effects. This continuum can account for the swift between the central and the peripheral routes, but has yet been lack of comprehensive and empirical testing since the beginning. However, researches has been done under three distinct conditions: high, low, and moderate. = The issue of multi- channel processing = This area of critique basically lands on the nature of ELM being a dual-process model, which indicates that the receivers will rely on one of the routes (central or peripheral) to process messages and possibly change attitude and behaviour. Stiff (1986) questioned the validity of ELM because the message should be able to be processed through two routes simultaneously. On top of Stiff's questioning, alternative models have been raised. Mackenzie et al (1986) advocated a Dual Mediation Hypothesis (DMH) that allow receivers to process the ad's content and its execution at the same time with reasonable vigilance. Lord et al. (1995) proposed a Combined Influence Hypothesis which argues that the central and peripheral cues worked in combination despite the variables of motivation and ability. Kruglanski et al. (1999) proposed a single cognitive process instead of the dual-process model. Although drawing on the fundamental conception from ELM, such as motivation, ability and continuum, the unimodel suggests a normative and heuristic rules for human to make judgement based on the evidence. The Heuristic Systematic Model (HSM) is another alternative model concerning this issue. = The analysis of the different variables which mediate elaboration likelihood = Many studies have been expanding and/or refining the model by examining and testing the variables, particularly in advertising research. For example, Britner and Obermiller (1985) were among the first to expand the model to new variables under the peripheral processing. They proposed situation, person, and product categories as new variables under the context of marketing.

It is on the West Coast Main Line, south east of , and north north west of . It is the northern terminus of the Settle and Carlisle Line, a continuation of the Midland Main Line from , and . It is so named because it is adjacent to Carlisle Citadel, a former medieval fortress. The station is owned by Network Rail. In September 1847, the first services departed the station, even though construction was not completed until the following year. It was built in a neo-Tudor style to the designs of English architect William Tite. Carlisle Station was one of a number of stations in the city, the others were Crown Street and London Road, but it was the dominant station by 1851. The other stations had their passenger services redirected to it and were closed. Between 1875 and 1876, the station was expanded to accommodate the lines of the Midland Railway which was the seventh railway company to use it. The Beeching cuts of the 1960s affected Carlisle, particularly the closure of the former North British Railway lines to Silloth, on 7 September 1964, and the Waverley Line to Edinburgh via Galashiels on 6 January 1969. The closure programme claimed neighbouring lines, including the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick Railway (the \\"Port Road\\") in 1965, resulting in a significant mileage increase via the Glasgow South Western Line & to reach Stranraer Harbour, and ferries to Northern Ireland. The station layout has undergone few changes other than the singling of the ex-NER Tyne Valley route to London Road Junction in the 1972‚Äì73 re-signalling scheme, which was associated with the electrification of the West Coast Main Line (WCML). Renovations to the platforms and glass roof were performed between 2015 and 2018. History =Construction and early operations= Close to the English border with Scotland, Carlisle became an important railway interchange in the first half of the 19th century. In 1836, Carlisle's first station opened at London Road for the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway; seven years later, Crown Street opened for the Maryport & Carlisle Railway. In the mid-1840s, work commenced on Carlisle Citadel on the south side of Court Square. Citadel station was built for the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway and the Caledonian Railways.‚ÄúCarlisle Citadel Station.‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôengineering-timelines.com‚Äô‚Äô, Retrieved: 25 June 2018. Carlisle station was designed by the architect William Tite. His design incorporated Tudor and Gothic styles. Built at a cost of ¬£53,000, the station was constructed between 1846 and 1848. On 10 September 1847, it was officially opened to rail traffic, even though construction was incomplete and only one long through platform with a bay at each end had been finished. The main station buildings have a multi-bay sandstone facade of two storeys, capped by rows of slate roofs at differing levels. The entrance portico is supported by five pointed arches with buttresses between. Roundels are placed over three arches; the central roundel bears the royal arms of Queen Victoria, flanked by those of the Lancaster & Carlisle and the Caledonian Railways but the outer plaques, intended for the Maryport & Carlisle and the Newcastle and Carlisle who did not contribute towards the cost of the station's construction, are blank. As a consequence of the station accommodating the complex timetables operated by two, and eventually seven operating companies, a joint management committee was established. On 10 May 1857, the Carlisle Citadel Station Agreement was drawn up and established under the Carlisle Citadel Station Act of 22 July 1861. The committee had eight directors, four each from the boards of the Caledonian and the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) which had absorbed the Lancaster & Carlisle in 1859. To improve freight services the Carlisle Goods Traffic Committee was formed after the Carlisle Citadel Station Act of 1873. The London & North Western, Midland, Caledonian and Glasgow & South Western each had two directors on the committee. To minimise the danger to passengers, a goods avoidance line was constructed to divert freight trains around the station. =Expansion and later service= A 1912 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Carlisle (shown here as CITADEL STATION) The Carlisle Citadel Station Act authorised changes, not restricted to freight, including an instruction \\"enlarging and improving facilities\\". Expansion work took place between 1873 and 1876 followed by a second phase between 1878 and 1881. While construction was taking place, the opening of the Midland Railway's Settle‚ÄìCarlisle line generated more freight trains from August 1875, and passenger services, started in April 1876. On 20 July 1881 improvements were officially completed. Carlisle station was used by seven railway companies, the London and North Western, London North Eastern, Midland, Caledonian, North British, Glasgow & South Western and Maryport & Carlisle. Each companies operated its own passenger amenities with separate booking and parcels offices. Additional tracks, buildings and platforms were constructed including an island platform with two-storey buildings which increased the 400 metre-long through platforms to three. Five terminal bay platforms were constructed and an overarching footbridge which connected the through platforms inside the train shed. Below the platforms, the undercroft contains a network of passageways, offices, service rooms and staff accommodation; parts of the underground areas are reputed to be haunted. During the construction programme an iron and glass large roof was installed behind the station buildings. As built, it spanned 85 metres across the platforms and tracks to cover an area in excess of 2.6 hectares. It consisted of 26 deep lattice girders, with a transverse span and 12.2 metre centres; each girder had 10 panels, stiffened end posts and a flat bottom tie. The girders supported a series of slender balanced cantilever half-truss hooped beams at approximately 3.7m centres, spanning the tracks. The ornate timber end screens had Gothic-style glazing bars. The roof was glazed using shingled panels, possibly making use of Rendel's patented Indestructible System, and was designed by Edinburgh-based engineering firm Blyth & Cunningham. =Twentieth century= During 1922, five of the seven companies that operated at the station were absorbed into the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) after the Railways Act 1921. During the Second World War, black paint was applied to the roof glazing as a precautionary measure against enemy air raids. Preventative maintenance gradually led to large areas of the glass roof becoming unsafe and forcing occasional platform closures after falling glass. In 1957 it was decided to reduce the area of the roof and concentrate maintenance activities on the remaining area. Between 1957 and 1958, the south-western half of the station roof, and portions of its north-eastern half and the end screens were removed. The original glass panes were replaced by large patent glazing panels. The substantial supporting wall at the south- western side of the station was left in place. The wall is built of sandstone and linked to the main buildings by a series of arched tunnels in the undercroft. In November 1972, the station received Grade II* listed status; its citation notes: \\"The building by Tite is among the most important early major railway stations in Britain\\". In April 1994, the freestanding retaining wall was also listed separately as Grade II. =Restorations= Refurbishment of the train shed roof in 2016 Between October 2010 and March 2011, a series of improvements were performed at Carlisle Station, focused upon its passenger amenities, such as the waiting, meeting and seating areas. From 13 July 2013 to 7 April 2014, as part of a ¬£1.5 million refurbishment project, accessibility at the station was improved via the refurbishment of the lifts and other alterations to achieve step-free access to all of the platforms. In conjunction, a formerly-disused subway was also renovated. According to rail industry publication Rail Engineer, it was clear by 2014 that the station's roof was in need of restoration. The steel trusses were found to have been sagging in places, which was speculated to have been a result not only of the structure's age but also come as a consequence of the alterations performed during the 1950s, having been exacerbated by the adoption of rigid glazing and insufficient drainage systems. Multiple panels have cracked or broken, resulting in the deployment of several nets to catch falling glass, while rain water often pooled in areas of the roof rather than draining away. Furthermore, maintenance activities were complicated by a lack of access to the roof on the part of safety restrictions, preventing even routine cleaning, thus the panels were perpetually dirty and provided poor natural lighting conditions throughout the platforms. During November 2015, work commenced upon the repair and refurbishment of the station's roof, as well as the rebuilding of all eight platforms under a ¬£14.7 million scheme that was managed and carried out by national rail infrastructure management company Network Rail.\\"Carlisle station to benefit from ¬£14m investment.\\" Network Rail, 24 November 2015. Retrieved 4 May 2017. This programme was planned by global design consulting firm Arcadis in close cooperation with both Historic England and Carlisle City Council; while the renovated roof was designed to incorporate modern elements and contemporary construction techniques, significant attention was reportedly paid to maintaining its historical aesthetic. The new roof is primarily composed of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (EFTE) sheeting and aluminium frames, which is claimed to possess a high level of resistance to corrosion as well as retaining considerable strength and being far lighter than conventional glass panes; other benefits include the roof being shatter-proof and self-cleaning. Construction company Galliford Try served as the principal contractor performing the roof replacement, while Vector Foiltec manufactured and fitted the EFTE sheets. It was also decided to repaint the metalwork of the roof, which was not originally included in the programme's scope.Marsh, Stewart. ‚ÄúLighter and brighter: Carlisle Citadel station is transformed.‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôrailengineer.uk‚Äô‚Äô, 17 November 2017.\\"Work on Carlisle's railway station roof nears completion.\\" newsandstar.co.uk, 24 February 2018. During February 2018, a second phase of this renovation programme, which was focused upon the platforms themselves, was scheduled to commence. Accidents and incidents * On 6 June 1961, a light engine and a freight train collided under the Caldewgate road bridge. * On 1 May 1984, a runaway freight train collided with and destroyed the River Caldew bridge at Dentonholme. This incident directly contributed to the decision to permanently close the goods line shortly thereafter.Rawlinson, R. \\"Cumbrian Railways Bog Junction to Willowholme Junction, Carlisle.\\" cumbria-railways.co.uk, Retrieved: 25 July 2013. However, the goods line was not dismantled; it has been speculated that it could be restored and re-opened to traffic one day, if the measure was to be deemed necessary for the relief of freight congestion in the vicinity of the station. Facilities The station is a fully staffed facility during normal hours; the booking office is typically manned each day from the start of services in the morning up until 20:00 in the evening. A number of ticket machines are also available in the booking hall, allowing tickets to be purchased even when the booking office is not in service. To the north of the station's portico, located directly between the main entrance and the station offices, is a square clock tower, furnished with an octagonal lantern; to the south of the portico are single-storey waiting and refreshment rooms. Interior details of these rooms included Tudor and Gothic-style fireplaces and linen-fold wood-panelled doors. Multiple waiting rooms are located on both of the station's main platforms; additionally, there is a newsagents present upon the concourse and a buffet on platform three. Train running information is provided across the station in the form of auditory announcements over a public address system, along with a series of distributed digital display screens. In line with accessibility legislation, full step- free access is possible to all platforms on the station via ramps to the footbridge or lifts and subway.\\"Carlisle station facilities.\\" National Rail Enquiries, Retrieved: 5 December 2016. Layout and services Station frontage Long-distance services are operated by Avanti West Coast, with the main routes being London Euston‚ÄìGlasgow Central and Scotland‚Äì-London Euston and TransPennine Express Scotland-Manchester. Caledonian Sleeper passengers from/to London Euston may also alight/board here. Northern operate local stopping services to Newcastle Central via the Tyne Valley Line, to Barrow-in- Furness via the Cumbrian Coast Line, and to Leeds via the scenic Settle‚ÄìCarlisle line. Abellio ScotRail also operate services to Glasgow Central via Dumfries and Kilmarnock. There are 8 platforms at the station in total ‚Äì 3 through and 5 bays, organised as follows (from west to east): *Platform 1: Relief West Coast Main Line platform (bi-directional) and occasional Caledonian Sleeper - this is the normal north-bound West Coast Main Line platform *Platform 2: Cumbrian Coast Line bay *Platform 3: West Coast Main Line north-bound platform (bi-directional), mostly TransPennine Express north-bound. Also Glasgow South Western line services originating from the Tyne Valley Line *Platform 4: West Coast Main Line south-bound platform (bi- directional). Also Tyne Valley line services originating from the Glasgow South Western Line *Platform 5 & 6: Tyne Valley Line bay/Carlisle to Leeds Line (Settle and Carlisle line) bay. These platforms often alternate *Platform 7: Scottish services to various destinations between Carlisle and Glasgow via the Glasgow South Western Line* *Platform 8: Early morning services to Scotland There are stabling roads between Platforms 3 and 4 in the train shed, and a loop around Platform 1. There are several electrified sidings to the west of Platform 1. There are substantial buildings on both the western island and the main up platform on the east side, with the main station buffet on the former and the travel centre/ticket office and shop on the latter. Both main platforms have waiting rooms and toilets and are linked by a fully accessible footbridge. Freight trains formerly used a goods line to the west to bypass the station, but this was closed in 1984 after a runaway rake of container wagons derailed at high speed on the River Caldew bridge at Dentonholme, damaging it beyond economic repair. Nearly all freight services (apart from those running directly from the Cumbrian Coast Line toward the Tyne Valley Line or the Settle‚ÄìCarlisle Line, or vice versa) now have to use one of the main platform lines when passing through the station, which can cause congestion at peak times. =2008= Service frequencies on each route varied ‚Äì on Mondays to Saturdays there were trains every one or two hours to London and at least every hour to Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh. First TransPennine Express operated seven trains per day to and there was a basic hourly service to both Newcastle and Whitehaven but a less frequent one to Glasgow via Kilmarnock (eight trains per day), to Leeds (six trains per day M‚ÄìF, seven SO) and to Barrow-in-Furness (seven). On Sundays the service was hourly on the WCML (every two hours to all main destinations apart from Manchester) and to Newcastle but infrequent on the other routes (three trains to Leeds and Whitehaven, two to Kilmarnock and another two to Dumfries only). There were two summer-only DalesRail afternoon trains to Preston via but no service to Barrow. By this time, the former CrossCountry services to such destinations as Cheltenham, Bristol, Plymouth, Southampton and Bournemouth had ceased. The Up 'Caledonian' leaving Carlisle in 1960 =2009= Service frequencies on the West Coast Main Line improved somewhat following the introduction of the new VHF timetable by Virgin Trains. From Mondays to Saturdays there were now trains every hour to London for much of the day (although one service from Euston no longer stopped here, running non-stop between Preston and Glasgow) and at least every hour to Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh. First TransPennine Express operated seven trains per day to and there was a basic hourly service to both Newcastle and Whitehaven but a less frequent one to Glasgow via Kilmarnock (eight trains per day), to Leeds (seven per day Mon‚ÄìSat since the May 2011 timetable alterations) and to Barrow-in- Furness (eight).

A Sunday service along the Cumbrian Coast line to Barrow also began at the summer 2018 timetable change (the first since 1976) - eight trains now run to Barrow, plus a further five to Whitehaven only. London North Eastern Railway London North Eastern Railway services call at Carlisle on a couple of weekends a year when the East Coast Main Line is closed for engineering work. They operate mainly hourly service to London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley. Caledonian Sleeper All Caledonian Sleeper services pass through Carlisle once a night except Saturdays (and engineering diversions) on their journey between London Euston and several Scottish destinations. Passengers may only board the London-bound service from Glasgow Central/Edinburgh Waverley, or only alight services in the opposite direction. Services from/to London Euston to/from Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William run as a separate train that runs through Carlisle without a scheduled stop. =Adverse weather in 2015-16= All services toward Glasgow & Edinburgh over the WCML were suspended due to flood-related damage to the River Clyde bridge at Lamington (caused by Storm Frank). A limited number of trains to & from Glasgow were being diverted via Dumfries, whilst most others were replaced by express coaches.

The game shares its setting with the collectible card game Shadowfist. The system is simple, with most detail being in the game's combat system. Combat is made to flow quickly, moving from one action scene to another very quickly. It was inspired and based on Hong Kong style action movies. The characters begin at a high level of skill, as appropriate for protagonists in the source films. After a successful Kickstarter, Atlas Games released a Second Edition of Feng Shui in late 2015, on the eve of the game's 20th anniversary of publication.  Overview  The name Feng Shui refers to one of the central themes of the game: those who control places with powerful Feng Shui control the world. These people find that events go in their favour more often than would be explained by chance. The outcomes of all major historical events, such as wars, elections and natural disasters are dictated by who has the most powerful Feng Shui. Numerous groups vie for control of these sites, and thus control of the world. Feng Shui crosses genre boundaries and includes martial arts, firearms, magic and advanced technology. One of the main features of the game is that the physical settings for scenes are meant to be vague, allowing the Game Master and the players room for creative improvisation and description of exciting stunts during combat.  Rules  The rules are intended to be simple and easy to learn. There is one central mechanism for making skill checks. Non-combat checks are generally resolved with a single roll of the dice, whereas a scene involving combat can last half an hour or more. = Skills checks = For each skill a character has, they have an associated Action Value that states how good they are at that skill. When a skill is used, two six-sided dice are rolled. One, the positive die, is added to the Action Value. The other, the negative die, is subtracted from that sum. The final value is the Action Result which is then compared to the difficulty of the task being performed. If the Action Result is greater than or equal to the difficulty, that action succeeds. Because the average Action Result is equal to the Action Value, the difficulty can simply be the Action Value of an opponent. = Schticks = Characters also have schticks, or special abilities, which greatly enhance either their combat prowess or their usefulness out of combat. Some can be acquired by a character as they become more experienced, but some are unique to a particular character archetype (see below). = Character creation = A character will be created based on one of the pre-written archetypes in the game, each typifying a protagonist from a certain genre of action film, such as the Maverick Cop, the Martial Artist, the Journalist and the Big Bruiser. The archetype defines what the character is best at, and although character advancement is free-form after initial creation, it is usual to remain within the original archetype. The character details are defined by attributes, skills, schticks and weapons. *Characters have \\"primary attributes\\" which are divided into \\"secondary attributes\\". However, in many cases all the secondary attributes are the same as their associated primary to simplify book-keeping. *\\"Skills\\" come as a skill bonus to be added to the appropriate secondary attribute, although after character creation only the final Action Value is important. *The character may have one or more \\"schticks\\" as part of the archetype, and may be able to choose some more. *\\"Weapons\\" appropriate to the character's style of fighting.  Setting  The game has a rich cross-genre setting, shared with Shadowfist. However, the rules can be used in single-genre games without the elaborate background. = The Netherworld = In various parts of the world there are portals to a place called the Netherworld. The Netherworld is a shifting labyrinth of tunnels and caves that connects portals to a number of different time periods of world history. These are 69, 1850, 1996 and the dystopian future of 2056. These periods are known as junctures and travel between them is possible through the Netherworld. The Netherworld itself is populated by a wide variety of strange inhabitants who, for whatever reason, no longer have a place in any of the junctures. In the second edition the ancient juncture is now at 690AD, and the dystopian future has become a post-apocalyptic one. = Superficial and Critical Shifts = A means to travel in time inevitably means that people will try to change the past or future. When this happens without a Feng Shui site changing ownership, this results in a superficial shift. Details change, but everything important remains the same. People may find themselves laterally reincarnated into a different name and job, but their memories will change to match their new identity. Whoever was in charge before is still in charge. However, when there is a significant change in the flow of Chi as a result of Feng Shui sites changing hands, there might be a critical shift. Such a shift may make major changes to history and the balance of power. World War II may have ended with the Axis powers victorious, a large part of the world might have become a peaceful Confucian state, or the entire world might be recreated according to some terrible pattern. As with superficial shifts, people will be laterally reincarnated to fit the new world. Anyone who has been to the Netherworld, however, does not get laterally reincarnated and will be acutely aware of the changes. = The Secret War = There are a number of factions fighting for control of the world across all four junctures. Their goal is to control enough sites with good Feng Shui to trigger a critical shift and remake the world in their favour. Because the average person is unaware of this, the ongoing struggle is known as the Secret War. Many of the factions have minions within their home junctures who are used to keep order there without knowing the truth behind it all. They also have powerful agents who are quite aware of the Netherworld and are active in other junctures. These agents are known as Innerwalkers or Secret Warriors - and the player characters number among them. There are seven main factions: *The Eaters of the Lotus are a group of evil eunuch sorcerers from the China of 69 AD. They rule Han-era China from behind a puppet emperor and wish to spread their power throughout the timestream. Their chief weapons are sorcery, demons, and political intrigue. *The Guiding Hand is a group of neo-Confucian monks committed to bringing about a world of peace and harmony within strict rules. They abhor the Western powers and seek to stamp out all foreign influence from China, no matter how beneficial, and despise modern thinking and technology. Their stronghold is in 1850s China and is hotly contested with the Ascended. They specialize in kung fu. *The Ascended are not truly human at all, but are the descendants of animals that became human through force of will. They abhor the magic that can turn them back into their primitive forms. They control the 1850 and 1996 junctures more-or-less totally, and prefer to use armies, police, criminal syndicates and their human secret warriors to do their dirty work in places intrinsically hostile to them. However, they are skilled in kung fu, guns and have abilities related to their animal heritage. *The Architects of the Flesh rule 2056. Their world is one based on equality, fairness and good order but enforced brutally and without compassion. They simply wish to extend their dominion through time 'for the good of everyone'. Their most effective weapons are arcanowave devices, which they graft onto humans and captured demons from 69 regardless of the consequences, and which have bad effects on humans who overuse them. *The Jammers are a psychotic group of anarchists composed mostly from deserters from the Architects and the subjects of their failed experiments on apes and monkeys. They want to wipe the world clean of all influences of Feng Shui at any cost, primarily by blowing every site they can find sky-high, regardless of who might get hurt or killed in the process. They principally use guns, heavy weapons, explosives and cyborg enhancements. *The Four Monarchs once ruled the world until a critical shift engineered by the Ascended removed them from power. Each of them now rules a portion of the Netherworld, scheming against each other and the other factions. Each of them is a powerful sorcerer in his or her own right, and their followers specialize in either sorcery or kung fu. *The Dragons are a loose set of idealistic warriors opposed to the tyranny of the other factions. It is to this group that the player characters will be inexorably drawn. = Hong Kong = For some reason, Hong Kong has a high concentration of both Feng Shui sites and Netherworld portals. It also has a history of being the place where the most significant battles in the Secret War take place.

Butcher comments that \\"Simply put, Feng Shui is brilliant.\\" Feng Shui was ranked 18th in the 1996 reader poll of Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"In a world, brilliant. Feng Shui recreates the movies that inspired it with single-minded genius, and consequently is one of the most fast-moving, action-packed and enjoyable roleplaying games around. Players are actively encouraged to perform all manner of outrageous stunts and hair- brained schemes, and the rules deliberately ignore all of the traditional roleplaying game elements that have a tendency to slow things down. Hardly ever has there been a game that offers as much pure action, excitement, adventure and fun as Feng Shui.\\" In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Feng Shui on its list of \\"The Millennium's Best Role-playing Games\\". Editor Scott Haring said that \\"Feng Shui found the way to do over-the-top cinematic roleplaying without turning it into an exercise in dice rolling and power trips\\".

American \\"first\\" supermodel Gia Carangi, is remembered for being the original \\"heroin chic model\\" The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the \\"healthy\\" and vibrant look of models such as Cindy Crawford, Elle Macpherson, and Claudia Schiffer. A 1996 article in the Los Angeles Times stated that the fashion industry had \\"a nihilistic vision of beauty\\" that was reflective of drug addiction. Background At the time during which heroin chic emerged, the popular image of heroin was changing for several reasons. The price of heroin had decreased, and its purity had increased dramatically.Durrant, Russil & Jo Thakker. Substance Use & Abuse: Cultural and Historical Perspectives. Sage Publications (2003), p87. . In the 1980s, the AIDS epidemic had made injecting heroin with unclean needles increasingly risky. Available heroin had become more pure, and snorting became a more common mode of heroin use. These changes decreased the stigma surrounding the drug, allowing heroin to find a new market among the middle-class and the wealthy, in contrast to its previous base of the poor and marginalized. Gia Carangi, who some call the \\"first supermodel\\" is remembered for being the origin of the heroin chic trend. Heroin infiltrated pop culture through attention brought to addictions in the early 1990s. In film, the heroin chic trend in fashion coincided with a string of films throughout the 1990s‚Äîsuch as The Basketball Diaries, Singles, Trainspotting, Kids, Permanent Midnight, and Pulp Fiction‚Äîthat examined heroin use and drug culture.The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. Women under the Influence. Johns Hopkins University Press (2006), p98. . =Grunge= In the early 1990s, the rise of the grunge alternative rock music and subculture in Seattle brought media attention to the use of heroin by prominent grunge artists. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of heroin by musicians in the Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 New York Times article listing the city's \\"three principal drugs\\" as \\"espresso, beer and heroin\\" and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the \\"...subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin\\". Tim Jonze from The Guardian states that \\"...heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its inception in the mid-80s\\" and he argues that the \\"...involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect to the music\\"; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland, as well as Courtney Love, Mark Lanegan and Evan Dando \\"...all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell the tale.\\" A 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s, people used the \\"stimulant\\" cocaine to socialize and \\"...celebrate good times\\", in the 1990s grunge scene, the \\"depressant\\" heroin was used to \\"retreat\\" into a \\"cocoon\\" and be \\"...sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offered...few prospects for...change or hope.\\"Marion, Nancy E and Oliver, Willard M. Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture. and the Law. ABC-CLIO, 2014 . p. 888. Leading grunge band Alice in Chains had a song \\"God Smack\\", which included the line \\"stick your arm for some real fun\\", a reference to injecting heroin. Seattle grunge musicians known to use heroin included Kurt Cobain, who was using \\"heroin when he shot himself in the head\\"; \\"Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone overdosed on heroin in 1990\\"; \\"Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch who died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992, along with Layne Staley of Alice in Chains who publicly detailed his battles with heroin...\\". Mike Starr of Alice in Chains and Jonathan Melvoin from The Smashing Pumpkins also died from heroin. After Cobain's death, his \\"...widow, singer Courtney Love, characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than in San Francisco or Los Angeles.\\" Rise and fall This waifish, emaciated look was the basis of the 1993 advertising campaign of Calvin Klein for his perfume Obsession featuring Kate Moss. Film director and actor Vincent Gallo contributed to the development of the image through his Calvin Klein fashion shoots.Calvin Klein special on the Biography channel The trend eventually faded, in part due to the drug-related death of prominent fashion photographer Davide Sorrenti in 1997. In 1999 Vogue dubbed Brazilian supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen \\"The Return of the Sexy Model\\" and the beginning of a new era. Criticism and analysis Heroin chic fashion drew much criticism and scorn, especially from anti-drug groups.Turns of Phrase: Heroin Chic Fashion designers, models such as Kate Moss and Jaime King, and movies such as Trainspotting were blamed for glamorizing heroin use. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton condemned the look.President Clinton on Heroin Chic Other commentators denied that fashion images made drug use itself more attractive. \\"There is no reason to expect that people attracted to the look promoted by Calvin Klein and other advertisers... will also be attracted to heroin, any more than suburban teen- agers who wear baggy pants and backward caps will end up shooting people from moving cars\\", wrote Jacob Sullum in Reason magazine.Sullum, Jacob. \\"Victims of Everything.\\" Reason Magazine (May 23, 1997) In popular culture In the Season Nine Seinfeld episode \\"The Voice\\", Jerry asks Elaine about her \\"somewhat de-poofed\\" hair, to which Elaine quips, \\"It's the new look.

He is Deputy Leader of the House of Lords and former Minister of State for Defence. Background and education Lord Howe was the son of the Royal Navy commander and film actor George Curzon, grandson of the 3rd Earl Howe and wife Jane Victoria Fergusson. He was educated at King's Mead School, Seaford, Rugby School, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in \\"Mods and Greats\\" in 1973 and, according to his Who's Who entry, earned the Chancellor's Prize in Latin Verse. Business and political career After leaving university in 1973, he joined Barclays Bank and served in a number of managerial and senior managerial posts in London and in other countries. After succeeding his second cousin as 7th Earl Howe in 1984, he left banking to concentrate on his Parliamentary activities and on running the family farm (Seagraves Farm Co Ltd) and estate at Penn in south Buckinghamshire. In 1991, Howe became a Lord in Waiting (Government whip in the House of Lords) with responsibilities, successively, for transport, employment, defence and environment. Following the 1992 general election he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and in 1995 Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, a post he relinquished at the 1997 general election. Howe was opposition spokesman for Health and Social Services in the House of Lords between 1997 and 2010. Howe was unique in being the only member of the Conservative Party to shadow the same portfolio throughout the thirteen years of opposition. Since the House of Lords Act 1999, hereditary peers do not have the automatic right to sit in the Lords. However the Act provides for 92 hereditary peers to remain, and representatives from each faction in the House are elected under Standing Orders of the House. At the election in 1999, Howe was the sixth most popular Conservative peer (Conservatives are by far the largest party grouping of hereditary peers). Apart from his frontbench responsibilities, his special interests include penal affairs and agriculture. He is a member of the all-party groups on penal affairs, abuse investigations, pharmaceuticals, adoption, mental health and epilepsy. Since Lord Strathclyde retired from the frontbench in January 2013, until he also retired from it in 2019, he was the least-recently appointed frontbencher (chosen in 1991). Other public appointments In 1999 Howe was appointed non-executive chairman of the London and Provincial Antique Dealers' Association (LAPADA), the country's largest trade association for the fine art and antiques trade. Involved in many charitable commitments, Howe is: *President of the Abbeyfield Beaconsfield Society *Patron of the Chiltern Society; *Patron of Design & Manufacture for Disability (DEMAND) *Hereditary Governor of the King William IV Naval Foundation. *a trustee of Milton's Cottage *President of the Epilepsy Society, formerly the National Society for Epilepsy, for 25 years until his wife Countess Howe became president in September 2010. *a trustee of RAFT (Restoration of Appearance and Function Trust); *a member of the Committee of Management of the RNLI; *a trustee of Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire; *President of the South Buckinghamshire Association for the Disabled; *Honorary Treasurer of the Trident Trust *a trustee of Penn Street Village Hall *a Vice-President at Knotty Green Cricket Club Personal life Lord Howe married Elizabeth Helen Stuart, elder daughter of Captain Burleigh Edward St Lawrence Stuart, on 26 March 1983. They have four children: *Lady Anna Elizabeth Curzon (19 January 1987) who studied music at the University of Nottingham. *Lady Flora Grace Curzon (12 June 1989) *Lady Lucinda Rose Curzon (12 October 1991) *Thomas Edward Penn Curzon, Viscount Curzon (22 October 1994) The family live at Penn House, Penn, Buckinghamshire, seat of the Earls Howe.Penn House website http://www.pennhouse.org.uk/ See also *Investigatory Powers Act 2016 References External links *Profile for Earl Howe @ Conservatives.com * Page on House of Lords website containing a register of Earl Howe's interests (current) * Page on House of Lords website containing a register of Earl Howe's interests (historic) * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Conservative Party (UK) Baronesses- and Lords-in-Waiting Frederick 7 Category:Hereditary peers elected under the House of Lords Act Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Rugby School ","title":"Frederick Curzon, 7th Earl Howe"},{"id":"2176891","text":"Order of Honor may refer to: *Order of Honor (Belarus) *Order of Honor (Georgia) *Order of Honour (Greek order) *Order of Honour (Russian Federation) *Order of Kurmet, Kazakhstan *Order of the Badge of Honor (Soviet Union) ","title":"Order of Honor"},{"id":"2176893","text":"Belinda \\"Lindy\\" Morrison (born 2 November 1951) is an Australian musician originally from Brisbane, Queensland.

Morrison has also performed in Silent Figures, Shrew, Xero, The Four Gods, Deep Blue Sea, Cleopatra Wong (with Amanda Brown ex-The Go-Betweens), and Tuff Monks. She played drums in The Rainy Season from 2007 until 2011.  Life  = Education = As a child, Morrison attended an independent school called Somerville House, located in the inner city suburb of South Brisbane. She attended the University of Queensland from 1968, completing a Bachelor of Social Work in 1972. It was during this period that she would meet the people and become involved in the activities that set the tone of her life. Morrison's final-year tutor, responsible for arranging placements for social work students, Roison Ann Hirschfeld was a member of the steering committee of the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS).\\"Goss a political biography\\" by Jamie Walker, Uni of QLD press 1995 p32 She approached Morrison about joining the ALS late in 1972.\\"Goss a political biography\\" by Jamie Walker, Uni of QLD press 1995 p35\\"Goss a political biography\\" by Jamie Walker, Uni of QLD press 1995 p37 = Social work = The Aboriginal Legal Service began operating out of the Uniting Church hall on Leichhardt Street, Spring Hill, in the winter of 1972.\\"Goss a political biography\\" by Jamie Walker, Uni of QLD press 1995 p36 Morrison was its second full-time employee. In her role as Aboriginal Field Officer for the ALS, Morrison worked alongside the radical aboriginal activist Denis Walker. Walker had founded a local chapter of the Australian Black Panthers and \\"refused to accept the legitimacy of 'White man's Law\\". The job of field officer involved her going out late at night on \\"pig-patrol\\" which she described as: > \\"...trying to stop the Police from picking up Aboriginal people coming out > of the hotels, because they'd take them in a put them in gaol for > drunkenness and the next morning I'd have to go to court, ask for bail, take > them across to the legal service and the lawyers would then have to work > towards stopping them being locked up or fined.

They provide grants to workers in the industry when they are ill. = Theatre and activism = During her time with the ALS, Morrison resided in Brisbane, sharing a house with aboriginals, musicians and the actors Geoffrey Rush and Bille Brown. It was during this period that she started playing drums.In an interview recorded for the ABC Radio National program \\"Pig City\\" Available at speechification.com (at 34:55 into the program material) After \\"burn out\\" and leaving the service of the ALS, a two-year sojourn in England followed. On her return to Queensland, she moved into acting believing that \\"the only salvation lay in art\\" . She was part of the Popular Theatre Troupe\\"The Go-Betweens\\" By David Nichols, Allen and Unwin 1997 p65 which protested against the Bjelke-Petersen led National Party government performing for free in public their sharply satirical political street theatre during a time when life in Queensland was felt to be strongly constrained by the government, select business groups, and political interests.\\"No! No! to Joh\\" by Pete Thomas published by Building Workers industrial Union (Queensland Branch) dated February 1979. = Music career = Shrew - Zero - Xero Morrison's first band, Shrew, performed in 1976 and 77. They were an all-girls acoustic band with members playing clarinet, saxophone, piano and guitar. Their repertoire consisted mainly of covers of 1940s pop songs. In 1978, Morrison's joined the band Xero. At the time, members included Irena Luckus, Nicki Nought and Deborah Thomas. The band started by performing Patti Smith and other punk covers before contributing their own material. Morrison said she left in 1981 because, \\"They wanted drum- machines and synthesisers.\\" The Go-Betweens The Go-Betweens formed in 1977 in Brisbane, Queensland with Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, the group had a succession of drummers and travelled to the United Kingdom in late 1979. They returned to Brisbane in 1980 and Morrison (ex-Xero) joined on drums and backing vocals. Their first single with Morrison, \\"Your Turn My Turn\\" appeared in September 1981 and was followed by \\"Hammer the Hammer\\" in March 1982. They recorded ten tracks as demos in Brisbane during 1981, which were released as Very Quick on the Eye by Man Made Records in 1982, the tracks showed that Morrison's \\"drum abilities, always a deeply underrated part of the band's appeal, fit hand in glove with the arrangements\\". By this time, Forster and Morrison were lovers and Morrison was living in Spring Hill a Brisbane suburb. The band's first official album, Send Me a Lullaby, produced by The Go- Betweens and Tony Cohen, appeared in February on Missing Link in Australia. Morrison provided the album title, in preference to Two Wimps and a Witch, from a Zelda Fitzgerald novel Save Me the Waltz. Forster and McLennan wrote all the tracks, they alternated lead vocal duties, except \\"People Know\\" which had Morrison on vocals and James Freud (Models) guesting on saxophone. In 2002, UK label Circus released a 2√ó CD version of Send Me a Lullaby which included \\"After the Fireworks\\" recorded as a collaboration with The Birthday Party's Nick Cave on vocals, Mick Harvey on piano and Rowland S. Howard on guitar. It had been released as a single under the band name, Tuff Monks in 1982 on Au Go Go Records. The Go-Betweens returned to UK and recorded their second album, Before Hollywood (May 1983), with John Brand producing. It established them as cult favourites while \\"Cattle and Cane\\" was released as a single and was \\"[arguably] the band's absolute highlight of its earliest years\\". Forster said of Morrison's drum part on the song, \\"It had a great rhythm which I don't think any drummer in the world could've played except her. That rhythm never ceases to amaze me.\\" In 2001, \\"Cattle and Cane\\" was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Following album releases were, Spring Hill Fair (September 1984) and Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express (March 1986). Amanda Brown joined later in that year. Within a few months, Brown and McLennan were lovers‚Äîmany of McLennan's new lyrics were about this relationship. Tallulah (June 1987), produced by The Go-Betweens for True Tone and Beggars Banquet contained their \\"most winsome and hummable songs, 'Right Here' and 'Bye Bye Pride'\\"; while Brown's contributions \\"added extra lustre\\". LO-MAX Records released a 2√ó CD version of Tallulah in 2004, one of the additional tracks, \\"Doo Wop in 'A' (Bam Boom)\\" was co-written by Morrison, Brown, McLennan and Forster. In November 1987, The Go-Betweens returned to Australia and John Willsteed (ex-Xero with Morrison) replaced Robert Vickers on bass. 16 Lovers Lane (1988), was the group's most commercial offering, providing the alternative radio hit \\"Streets of Your Town\\" (1988), which became the band's biggest chart hit in both the UK and Australia peaking in the Top 100. The follow-up single \\"Was There Anything I Could Do?\\" was a No. 16 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations. Minimal commercial success were hardly the hoped-for breakthrough for the band, and after recording six albums, Forster and McLennan disbanded The Go-Betweens in December 1989. Morrison and Forster had separated as a couple earlier and both Forster and McLennan pursued solo careers. Brown and Morrison formed Cleopatra Wong in 1991. In 2008, 16 Lovers Lane was highlighted on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) TV's The Great Australian Albums series as a classic example of 1980s rock music. Educational work and writing Morrison is also the author of a short workbook entitled \\"Australian women in rock and pop music\\" and made an hour-long video to accompany it. Intended as student material it is housed in the Performing Arts Collection, the Arts Centre, Melbourne, and the National Library of Australia.NLofA (video) 1875856765 (workbook) Interviewees for the video include Kylie Minogue, Tina Arena and Wendy Matthews. Morrison was also the artist in residence at South Sydney Youth Service (1998‚Äì2001) and was employed by TAFE as the head tutor for the music course run by SSYS. She also teaches contracts and copyright and music business modules at TAFE. = Politics = Morrison stood for election as a candidate for the Australian Democrats in the New South Wales seat of Coogee at the 2003 state elections, and in the Division of Wentworth at the 2004 federal elections. =Recognition= On 26 January 2013, Morrison was awarded an Order of Australia Medal for services as a performer and advocate. Morrison was appointed a Lifetime Honorary Member of the Music Council of Australia in 2007. For services as Board member and one who \\"gave great assistance to community music initiatives and guidance in issues around performers' rights\\". In 2008, an image of Morrison painted by artist Katherine Close was entered in the 2008 Archibald prize. The image depicts her sitting behind her favourite 'Ludwig' drum kit, the actual drum kit used on most of the Go-Betweens recordings and performances. = Current activities = From November 2007 to 2011, Morrison was a member of The Rainy Season, a five-piece band fronted by Jed Brown, and including Peter Jones (ex Cosmic Psychos), Clyde Bramley, and fellow former Go Between Amanda Brown.

It was originally bred in Tosa, Shikoku (present day K≈çchi) as a fighting dog and is the only breed still used (legally) in Japanese dog fighting. Ownership is restricted in some countries as a dangerous breed.  Appearance  The Tosa varies considerably in size, with the Japanese-bred dogs tending to be about half the size of those bred outside the country. The Japanese breed generally weighs between , while the non-Japanese breeders have focused on dogs that weigh from and stand at the withers. The coat is characterized by its short and smooth appearance and is often red, brindle or fawn, but occasionally it can be a dull black. Maintenance of the coat is usually minimal. Dogs can occasionally tip the scale at . In Japan they are considered the equivalent of Sumo wrestlers, and are even depicted in wrestling accoutrement. History The head of a Tosa This breed originated in the second half of the 19th century. The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu (an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high). These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, English Mastiff in 1874, Saint Bernard and German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and Bull Terrier. The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful dog. The heyday of Tosa breeding was between 1924 and 1933, when it was said that there were more than 5,000 Tosa breeders in Japan. Legal matters Tosa Inu puppies 4 months Ownership of Tosas is legally restricted in certain jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom ownership is regulated under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, and in Trinidad & Tobago under the Dog Control Act 2014. A specific exemption of a British court is required to own and import Tosas legally in the UK.

The first settlers were fugitives who called themselves bezrodnye (, \\"without kith or kin\\") and the village they set up had the name Bezrodnoye. In 1720, Peter the Great, noting the abundance of mulberry forests in the area, ordered building a state-run silk factory there. Modern Volzhsky was founded in 1951. It had a population of about 10,000 at that time. In 1954, it was granted city status. Its biggest upsurge of population came for the construction of the Volga Hydroelectric Station. Volzhsky grew around a hydroelectric power station which was built by Komsomol volunteers and by civil convict labor, who numbered almost 27,000 by 1953.Volgograd City Portal. –í–æ–ª–∂—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ–≥ –Ω–∞–≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—è–Ω–Ω—ã–º!

At right are two men in red; one is holding a red card aloft in his right hand. In the background is a crowd. The scene is artificially lit. In sports, an ejection (also known as dismissal, sending-off, or disqualification) is the removal of a participant from a contest due to a violation of the sport's rules. The exact violations that lead to an ejection vary depending upon the sport, but common causes for ejection include unsportsmanlike conduct, violent acts against another participant that are beyond the sport's generally accepted standards for such acts, abuse against officials, violations of the sport's rules that the contest official deems to be egregious, or the use of an illegal substance to better a player's game. Most sports have provisions that allow players to be ejected, and many allow for the ejection of coaches, managers, or other non-playing personnel. The decision to eject a participant usually lies with one or more officials present at the contest (e.g., referees or umpires). In addition to removal from the contest, many sports leagues provide additional sanctions against participants who have been ejected, such as monetary fines or suspensions from future contests. When the offender is ejected, they must leave the immediate playing area; in most cases, this means going to the locker room or other part of the venue out of sight of the playing area, or in extreme cases, leaving the facility grounds. In many youth sports leagues, ejected players are required to stay with their coach in the team area, or at least be supervised by an adult at whatever location the player is required to go. If a participant refuses to cooperate with an ejection, additional sanctions may be levied, such as forfeiture of the contest, monetary fines, or suspensions. Rarely, outside actions and sanctions from law enforcement authorities may be required. Conditions =Basketball= In the National Basketball Association (NBA) and most other basketball games, a player or coach is ejected from the game if he accumulates two technical fouls of an unsportsmanlike nature or Type 1 flagrant fouls over the course of the game. Participants who commit a Type 2 flagrant foul or intentionally enter the stands are ejected summarily regardless of the number of technical fouls accumulated. Ejected players/coaches must leave the court area for the remainder of play, and must do so immediately, or else risk even heavier fines/suspensions. In the NBA, an ejection will result in, at minimum, a $1,000 fine; an ejection for leaving the bench during a fight carries at least a one-game suspension as well. In domestic games, refusing to leave after being ejected can result in a player being put on report. If being put on report does not provide enough encouragement for a player to leave the court, the official may award the game to the opposing team, regardless of score. Players who incur 16 technical fouls in a single NBA season are automatically suspended for one game; an additional suspension is imposed for each increment of two thereafter. Should a player receive the 16th technical foul in the last regular-season game, he will be suspended for the first game in the next season, unless if his team is in the playoffs, when he will be suspended for the first playoff game. In the playoffs, players are suspended if they receive seven technical fouls. A significant rule change was made in 1981 whereby the NBA eliminated the ejection of a coach for three technical fouls caused by an illegal defense. Also, in the NBA ejections and suspensions are not permissible if a technical foul is caused by an excessive timeout, delay of game, accidental departure from the coach's box, the destruction of a backboard caused by a play (such as a dunk), defensive hanging on any part of the basket unit to successfully touch a ball (Rule 12), or any remaining in the game after six fouls when a team is out of players because of fouls, injuries, and ejections under Rule 3, Section I, paragraph b. These technical fouls are referenced in the NBA rule book as \\"Non-Unsportsmanlike Conduct Technical Fouls\\". In games sanctioned by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), a player is ejected for two technicals (since October 1, 2014), unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying foul. Technical fouls in FIBA include swinging of elbows without contact and flopping, which are not fouls in the NBA. A coach can be ejected upon having incurred two coach technical fouls, or a combination of three bench and coach technical fouls. There is no separation regarding a \\"non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul,\\" as in the NBA, so two delay of game violations result in an ejection. In NFHS contests, ejected players must remain on the team bench, so that they may continue to be supervised by a coach or other adult team representative. If an adult team representative other than the head coach, such as an adult assistant coach, can provide supervision from the court and to the locker room for the duration of the contest, the player may leave the visual confines of the playing area with this representative. In National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) contests, ejected players are dismissed to the locker room; no adult supervision is required as NCAA players are assumed to be legally of adult age. Disqualification Basketball also features disqualification, also known as fouling out. A player who commits a certain number of personal fouls in a game (5 or 6 in most leagues), is removed from the game and is said to have \\"fouled out\\". Unlike ejection, disqualification is not considered a punitive action but rather a natural consequence of a very physical sport with many instances of contact. Disqualified players are permitted to remain on the bench with the team (instead of being sent to the locker room, as with an ejected player) and are not subject to any further penalties (such as fines or suspensions); they can resume play in their next game. The NBA all-time leader in disqualifications is Vern Mikkelsen, who was disqualified 127 times in 631 games. In the NBA, a technical foul (which does not count towards suspension or ejection) is also assessed for re-entering a game after fouling out of a game in emergency situations listed in Rule 3, Section I when a team is reduced to five players. Once that occurs, a technical foul is charged if a player remains in the game after his sixth or subsequent foul, or as the last player to foul out, re-enters the game in case of injury to an eligible player that must be removed. =Baseball= Baseball umpire Lance Barksdale signalling an ejection In baseball, each umpire has a considerable amount of discretion, and may eject any player, coach, or manager solely on his own judgment of unsportsmanlike conduct. The ejectable offense may be an excessively heated or offensive argument with an umpire, offensive interference (contact with the catcher on a play at the plate), malicious game play (especially pitchers attempting to intentionally strike batters with the ball or a manager or coach ordering a pitcher to do so), illegally applying a foreign substance to a bat or otherwise tampering with a ball (most infamously, George Brett's Pine Tar Game), using a corked bat, charging the mound, or otherwise fighting. Between players and umpires, there is a common understanding that a certain level of argument is permitted, but players who too vigorously question an umpire's judgment of balls and strikes, argue a balk and/or use foul language may risk an ejection. A player is also automatically ejected when a bat, glove, cap or helmet is taken off and thrown down in anger and/or confusion. Umpires can signal an ejection by pointing at the person to be removed from the game and then, with his finger still pointed, extending his arm away from the player. This signal, which can vary significantly from umpire to umpire, is not always used, especially when an ejection occurs under relatively calm circumstances and/or where it is obvious an automatic ejection is warranted (such as will usually be the case, for example, when a broken bat is discovered to have been corked). On such a case, the umpire can simply inform the player and his team of the disqualification. Persons other than players, coaches and managers, such as spectators, ballpark staff, mascots, or members of the media, may be ejected at an umpire's discretion. Depending on the circumstances, spectators who are ejected may also face arrest and prosecution. Bat boys and ball boys may be ejected for not wearing proper safety equipment. Despite having been ejected, the manager of the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers continues to argue with the umpire. In some cases, an ejection is followed by a fine or a suspension by the league if the player, or manager or coach, reacts in a very hostile manner towards the umpire. Also, any ejection for malicious game play will normally result in a suspension. Some managers will engage in arguments with umpires specifically to provoke an ejection, in hopes of inspiring a rally from their team. Former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox holds the Major League Baseball (MLB) record for most times ejected with 161, while Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem holds the record for most ejections issued by an umpire with 251. Baseball has a rich vocabulary for describing ejections: a player or coach may also be \\"run\\", \\"thrown out\\", \\"banned\\", \\"given the ol' heave-ho\\", \\"sent to the clubhouse\\", \\"hit the showers\\", \\"tossed\\", \\"kicked out\\", \\"dumped\\", \\"sent off\\", \\"pitched\\", \\"bounced out\\", \\"canned\\", \\"chucked\\", or \\"booted\\". The umpire can signal an ejection by pointing to the dugout or waving his arm toward the dugout in a ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù motion, usually yelling at the ejected person to leave. Fans of a home team usually cheer when a player from the visiting team is ejected. Managers or other players usually come out of the dugout and push the offending player away so as to keep them from getting into more trouble with the umpire. Managers often are simultaneously ejected when attempting to protect a player or otherwise leaving the dugout during play. Once an ejection is called, the ejected person and other associated people usually continue yelling at the umpire, with more anger. This is colloquially known as ‚Äúgetting your money‚Äôs worth\\"‚Äîa reference to the automatic fine levied by most leagues (especially at the professional level) for getting ejected from a game. =American football= Any player or team official who commits a personal foul (i.e. striking, kicking, kneeing) or act of unnecessary roughness against another player or team official, an act of unsportsmanlike conduct, or a palpably unfair act is liable to be disqualified from further participation if the act is found to be flagrant. Any player or team official who fights with another player or team official, leaves the bench to take part in a fight, intentionally makes contact with or assaults a game official, or uses any item of equipment as a weapon is automatically disqualified. If a player or team official is disqualified, their team is assessed a 15-yard penalty, but if a player or team official has been disqualified for a palpably unfair act, the distance and/or score penalty will be determined by the referee after consultation with the other officials. Compared to other American sports (perhaps with the exception of basketball), ejections in American football are relatively uncommon considering the physical nature of the sport. Professional football The National Football League (NFL) made an experimental rule change on March 23, 2016, for the following season stating that two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on a player would result in an automatic ejection from the game. Some coaches have expressed concern that this could result in a player with one such penalty being goaded by the opposing team into a second penalty to get them removed from the game. From the 2018 season, players who commit flagrant helmet clashes are automatically ejected.It's the year of ejections in the NFL: Inside the trend - Kevin Seifert, ESPN, 24 September 2018 College football Per National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules, a player is automatically disqualified if they are determined to have led with the crown of their helmet, or targeted a defenseless player's head or neck area. In addition, if the offence is committed in the second half of a game, the player is suspended for the first half of the following game. High school football Rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) dictate that a player or team official is automatically disqualified if they receive two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the same game. =Association football= alt=An arm and hand, extended upward, with a black sweatband around the wrist holding a small red square plastic card by its bottom corner In association football, a player is dismissed from the field of play by the referee showing him/her a red card if (s)he commits a dismissible offence or has committed a second cautionable (yellow card) offence having already received a yellow card in the same game. The act of ejection is referred to in the sport as \\"sending off\\". A difference between being dismissed in association football and the above-mentioned sports is that in association football, a player may not be replaced, forcing their team to play a team member down for the remainder of the match. Additionally, a dismissal in any professional league results in an automatic suspension of at least one match. It is also possible for the manager or other team official to be \\"sent off\\" (often referred to as being \\"sent to the stands\\"), which requires them to leave their dugout and sit in the stands away from the touch line. This usually requires another member of the coaching staff to make decisions for the team, such as substitutes and formation. Also, depending upon the rules of the association presiding over the game, the manager or team official may not be allowed on the bench or to communicate with assistants for at least their team's next game. If the same team has 5 players who have been \\"sent off\\", the match is then \\"abandoned\\", that is, the game no longer continues. The officials then file a game report with the appropriate league or association. The league or associations then decides if a forfeit will be assessed and what the final score is recorded as. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the most red cards administered in one game is 20, for a match between Paraguayan teams Sportivo Ameliano and General Caballero that broke down into a generalized brawl and was subsequently abandoned. =Rugby= In all codes of rugby, a player may be temporarily suspended for a period of the match. In rugby union and rugby league, the standard suspension period is 10 minutes (out of an 80-minute game). This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the sin bin and is signaled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a yellow card (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union. In rugby union sevens, which normally lasts 14 minutes (20 in finals), the suspension period is 2 minutes. While eight minutes shorter than in fifteens, suspensions are more severe in sevens as one seventh of the team is out for one seventh of the match; this opens up more space than losing one fifteenth of the team for one eighth of the match. Temporary suspensions are usually given for repeated infringements (by either the same player or team), professional fouls and foul play, such as high tackles. A player cannot be replaced while temporarily suspended, though may be at the conclusion of the suspension period. For more serious offences or a second infraction warranting a temporary suspension sanction, a player may be sent off for the rest of the game, with no replacement allowable. Special conditions exist in rugby union for the replacement of a sinbinned or sent-off front-row forward. Referees also have the power to send team officials to the stands, similar to that in football. =Cricket= Prior to 2017, there was no provision in the Laws for a player to be ejected, although post-game disciplinary action could occur. There was, in keeping with the spirit of the game, provision in the Laws (Law 41, Law 42 prior to 2017) for umpires to eject a bowler from their team's bowling attack in the remainder of the team's innings, detailed below. The Laws of Cricket 2017 Code introduced a new Law (Law 42) dealing with players' conduct, as it was widely accepted that a need existed to provide the umpires with on-field sanctions for poor conduct, and that such sanction could lead to sending off for acts of violence. Under the new Law, four different levels of offences were created: a Level 3 offence (intimidating an umpire by language or gesture, or threatening to assault a player or any other person except an umpire) results in the offending player being suspended for a number of overs dependent on the length of the match, while a Level 4 offence (threatening to assault or making inappropriate or deliberate physical contact with an umpire, physically assaulting a player or any other person, or committing any other act of violence) results in the offending player being removed from the field for the remainder of the match. In circumstances where a players' conduct offence of any level has been committed, the umpires will halt the game, summon the offending player's captain to the field, inform the captain of the breach of Law and the associated penalty. In the event of a Level 3 or Level 4 offence, they will instruct the captain to remove the offending player from the field; if the offending player's captain refuses to comply with an instruction to remove a player, the umpires will award the match to the opposition, or if both captains are involved and refuse to comply, abandon the match. Furthermore, any player conduct offence will result in a report to the Executive of the offending player's team and to the Governing Body responsible for the match who (as was the case in the prior Laws) may take additional disciplinary action after the match. Bowlers Additionally, the umpires have the power to eject a bowler from the team's bowling attack for the remainder of the innings (in the case of a one-innings match or the second innings of a two-innings match, the remainder of the match) if the bowler, after having received one or two prior warnings (depending on prior offences), is guilty of throwing (law 21.3), ball-tampering (law 41.3), dangerous and unfair bowling (laws 41.6), time wasting (law 41.9) or running onto the protected area of the pitch (law 41.13). Any bowler who is guilty of deliberately bowling a high full-pitched ball (law 41.7) or deliberately bowling a front foot no-ball (law 41.8) is automatically ejected. If a bowler is ejected, the umpires will direct the captain of the fielding team, once the ball is dead, to take the bowler off forthwith. If there is an over in progress when the bowler is ejected, it shall be completed by another bowler who shall neither have bowled the previous over nor be allowed to bowl the next over. The bowler thus ejected shall not bowl again in that innings, or again in the match if they have been ejected for ball-tampering. =Ice hockey= In ice hockey, there are several types of ejections for penalties: game ejection, game misconduct penalty, match penalty, and gross misconduct penalty. Some hockey leagues may only use some of these. A game ejection is issued during games sanctioned by Hockey Canada for three stick-infraction penalties or three head-contact penalties. The stick-infraction penalties include cross checking, high sticking, butt ending, slashing, and spearing. The head-contact penalties include deliberate contact with an opponent's head, and hits on vulnerable players. A game misconduct penalty is usually issued against a player for unsportsmanlike play, escalating a fight, or leaving the penalty box before he has completed serving time for another penalty, although some major penalties carry an automatic game misconduct. If a player incurs three game misconducts in a season, he or she will be given a one-match ban. The player must leave the ice immediately, and a substitute may take over. However, if any other penalties are incurred by the ejected player in the same incident, they must be served in the penalty box by the substituting player. By the USA Hockey rules, a player can receive a game misconduct for violently checking an opponent into the boards from behind, or if the opponent's head strikes the boards or the goal frame as a result of the check from behind. It is also common knowledge that a player receives a game misconduct, regardless of the force of the hit, the second time (s)he checks an opponent from behind. A referee signals a misconduct penalty by tapping his hands on his hips several times. A match penalty is usually issued against a player for deliberately attempting to injure another player, such as stomping on him with their skate or a malicious hit. In addition to the offending player being immediately ejected (and usually subject to suspension), another player must serve a five- minute major penalty in the penalty box in addition to any other penalties imposed. The only exception is if a match penalty is against a goaltender, in which case the replacement goaltender can enter the ice immediately and a non- goaltender player serves the penalties. Match penalties may also be automatically flagged for review and supplementary discipline, depending on the league or association. A referee signals a match penalty by patting the flat part of his hand on the top of his head. A gross misconduct penalty is issued for an action far outside the normal level of acceptable behavior; for example, when a player has \\"made a travesty of the game\\". The National Hockey League (NHL) removed the penalty from their rule book following the 2006‚Äì07 season. Other leagues continue to use the penalty; the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) issues them in instances of racist language. =Water polo= An ejection is called for a hold, sink, or pullback by a defensive player, on an opponent without active control of the ball. Their team must play with one fewer defender until 20 seconds have elapsed or there is a change of possession, after which the ejected player or a substitute can reenter the game. These 6 vs 5 situations are often called \\"man up\\", \\"man down\\", or a \\"power play\\". Should any player acquire 3 personal fouls (penalties/ejections) the player must sit out for the remainder the game. If a player commits a foul within 5 meters of the goal that prevents a probable goal, the offense will be awarded a penalty shot. Ejections and penalties are also incurred due to interference of a play. For example, if an ordinary foul is called (one blast of whistle) and the defensive player does not disengage, an ejection can be incurred. If an ejected player fails to promptly make their way to the penalty box, the offensive team will be awarded a penalty shot. A misconduct foul can be incurred for unacceptable language or disrespect, violence, persistent fouls, or taking part in the game after being excluded. Players in the water that acquire a misconduct foul (shown by circular hand motions by the referee) must sit out for the remainder of the game. Coaches and players on the bench may be removed by being awarded a red card. A brutality, the most serious foul, occurs when a player strikes an opponent or official with malicious intent. The offending player is removed for the remainder of the game, and their team plays with one fewer player for a full 4 minutes. The player must also face further consequences according to their respective rulebook (NCAA, FINA, NFHS, etc.), usually involving a suspension from subsequent games. The severity of the penalty makes brutalities a very rare occurrence. =Field lacrosse= In field lacrosse, an ejection (expulsion foul) is issued for a severe penalty, such as fighting, leaving the bench to take part in a fight, malicious hits, deliberately attempting to injure another player, blatant fouls at the end of or immediately following a game, or, in high school, receiving two unreleasable unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Coaches and team officials can also be ejected for being caught using alcohol or tobacco during a game. The team guilty of the expulsion foul must serve a three-minute non- releasable penalty, and the ejected player/coach/official is suspended for at least the next game. Fouling out occurs if a player incurs five minutes of personal foul penalty time (I.e. slashing, illegal body check, tripping, unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, punishable by a one to three minute penalty), but does not result in a suspension from the next game. Technical fouls do not count towards the five minutes; however a player may be called for unsportsmanlike conduct if they repeatedly commit the same technical foul, in which case it would count toward fouling out. =Motorsport= Officials have authority to penalize and, if need be, disqualify participants. This is typically assessed on the entry in the race itself, and often signaled with a black flag being shown to the offender. Reasons include for safety (a car excessively damaged or unable to maintain a safe speed relative to others) or conduct (unsafe driving from blocking a faster car unsafely to intentionally wrecking another). Racing leagues may also assess other penalties, whether a fine, a loss of championship points or standing, or even suspension for a number of events. In NASCAR-sanctioned competitions, officials may eject crew members for vehicle infractions and both drivers and crew for disciplinary reasons. Crew members may also be ejected during vehicle inspection primarily with the Optical Scanning System but with other techniques before practice, qualifying, or the race, with the severity of the penalty is based on when the infraction occurs. If the infraction occurs where the parc ferm√© situation has qualifying one day, then the cars are locked in parc ferm√© afterwards until inspection and the race the next day, the first inspection failure means the car loses its qualifying time, and if necessary, removed from the event and the highest-placed non- qualifier, should they pass inspection, be reinstated. If the infraction occurs during inspection during any situation (before or after practice or qualifying, or before the race, regardless of parc ferm√© situations) and the car fails twice, one of the team's mechanics is ejected from the event. Three failures and the car will have to also be penalised with a 15-minute penalty from practice the ensuing race, or in pre-race situations, a pass-through pit lane on the opening lap, and four times will instigate a ten-point penalty. Additional penalties In some instances, a player or coach who is ejected must serve a suspension and may pay a fine. Often, the suspension is one game for the first offense, with harsher penalties depending on subsequent ejections and the severity of the offense. Sometimes in professional sports, a fine may be sanctioned against a player or coach. Most NFHS contests require ejected players to remain in the team area, so they may be supervised by a responsible team adult, usually the head or assistant coach (as requiring a minor to leave an area unsupervised can lead to legal liabilities). If the player continues to be unruly, other solutions may be implemented such as requiring an assistant coach to leave the area with the player, handing the player over to the school administrator on duty, requiring the player's parents/legal guardians to take the player home, or more rarely, if the ejected player becomes violent, law enforcement to take them into custody.

The term is similar to dandruff, when an excess of flakes becomes visible. Skin flakes that come off the main body of an animal are dander, while the flakes of skin called dandruff come from the scalp and are composed of epithelial skin cells. The surface layer of mammalian skin is called the stratum corneum, which is shed as part of normal skin replacement. Dander is microscopic, and can be transported through the air in house dust, where it forms the diet of the dust mites. Through the air, dander can enter the mucous membranes in the nose and lungs, causing allergies in susceptible individuals, largely through the mechanism of allergy to proteins in the bodies of the dust mites that live on dander. Dander builds up in carpets and in mattresses and pillows, so smooth surfaces predispose to an environment where levels of dander can be controlled more easily. More pet dander is sloughed off in older animals than in younger animals. Dander build up can be a cause of allergies, such as allergic rhinitis, in humans.http://www.babyfirstyear.org/2009/07/is-your-carpet-making-your-child- sick.html \\"Dr. Paivi Salo, and allergy expert at the National Institute of Health states 'Currently, airborne allergies affect approximately 10-30% of adults and 40% of children.'‚Äù Damp dusting and vacuum cleaners with sealed bodies and fitted with HEPA filters reduce re-distribution of the dander dust, with associated dust mites, into the air.

Location The chain of islands known as Buvuma Islands consists of more than fifty islands and is located a few kilometres off the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Uganda in the Napoleon Gulf. Buvuma is approximately , by water, south of the major city of Jinja, and around , south-east of the national capital, Kampala. It is part of the wider Buganda region, and was administered as part of Mukono but was recently made into a district of its own by the government of Uganda. Description The main island is Buvuma, with a land area of around 200 square-miles (517 km¬≤), and a population of around 20,000. It is forested, and is a destination for intrepid bird-watching tourists. The forest is being cut and burned to provide three boats a day full of charcoal for the nearby city of Jinja. There are twenty-six gazetted Forest Reserves in Buvuma. Transportation and health There is a somewhat unreliable ferry to the mainland. There are also unofficial small boat services from Kiyindi, a major fishing village on the shores of Lake Victoria. Boat taxis provide transportation daily from the islands to Masese, a landing site near Jinja. There are two health centres, but no electricity on the island. Sleeping sickness and tsetse flies are major concerns. Because of the communities' heavy reliance on the lake water, which is infested with parasites, inhabitants are susceptible to Bilharzia. Economy The area is very poor compared to other parts of Uganda because funds allocated to it are often diverted before they reach the island. The waters around the islands are rich in fish, and the local Bavuma and Basoga are fishermen. In 2012, Bidco Palm Oil Limited, a regional edible oil manufacturer, unveiled plans to establish a palm oil plantation and processing factory, beginning in 2013. With another , in a planned outgrowers' scheme, the entire Bidco Palm Oil Project on Buvuma Island is expected to grow to , when completed.BIDCO Plans 10,000 Hectare Pailm Oil Project In Buvuma Education and religion Most adults are illiterate and speak no English (one of the official languages of Uganda). One third of the population is Muslim, one third is animist, and the other one third is Christian. The longest running missionary project is Youth With A Mission (YWAM) on Lingira Island.About YWAM Buvuma They have a primary health care and community development project that has been running since 1991. On the main island of Buvuma, the World Gospel Mission does some limited child immunization, clean water projects, trains traditional birth attendants, and sponsors a primary school.About World Gospel Mission Buvuma Parliamentary representative The Buvuma elected Parliamentary representative (2001-2006 and 2006-2011) was William Nsubuga. he succeeded John Richard Wasswa who reigned from 1996 to 2001. In 2011 Migadde Robert Ndugwa was elected to replace Nsubuga. In 2016, Migadde Robert Ndugwa was re-elected for the second term that ends 2021. Geology and deforestation The islands are of ironstone formation overlying quartzite and crystalline schists. Other islands are Bugaia, Lingira (pop. 1000), and Namiti. Rusinga and Mfangano are within Kenyan borders. The 1911 Britannica said: \\"Most of these islands are densely forested, and some of them attain considerable elevation. Their scenery is of striking beauty.\\" Except at the highest elevations, Rusinga and Mfangano are today largely deforested. Buvuma district is a unique place with dense tropical forests with a range of insects, birds, animals, iplant species, alongside sandy beaches at various Islands. The islands are naturally gifted with a number of tourism attraction sites, that promotes: Birding, Camping, Viewing wildlife, Nature walks, Site seeing, Rocks climbing, Boat riding, Forest hikes, Nature photography, Sport fishing, Sunsetting moments, Water games, among others, that you will see when you venture in Buvuma Islands. Archaeological research Rusinga is rich in fossils, and Mary Leakey found the skull of Proconsul africanus on the island. The Miocene floras of Rusinga and Mfwanganu islands are subject to a long-term study by paleobotanists. There was an archaeological prospection carried out by the Tervuren Museum, Belgium, in 1968 (published 1971), on Buvuma and Bugaia islands at Munyama Cave, Tonge Cave, and Nakisito, plus another 47 sites. Pottery materials from 13,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C. were found.

He was a historic publisher occupying a better part of his work with documenting the History of the Azores (primarily from the island of Terceira), where he was responsible for writing the Anais da Ilha Terceira ('Annals of the island of Terceira'). Biography Francisco Ferreira Drummond was born in the modern parish of Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o, Terceira. He was the son of Tom√© Ferreira Drumond, a wealthy landowner, and his wife Rita de C√°ssia, who delivered Francisco at home on 21 January 1796 and baptized six days later. The Drummond family was intimately linked to the first educational classes and administrators of the Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o: Tom√© would hold the presidency in 1821, and his older brother, Jos√© Ferreira Drummond, was the Ordinance Captain, dominating the local political life for various decades. Francisco, since his infancy, revealed a vocation in languages and music, under the influence of his paternal uncle the Kings-Master Francisco Machado Drummond. Concluding his early primary instruction, he studied Latin, logic and rhetoric. His musical abilities provided his with a nomination to the organists chair at the Parochial Church in Praia da Vit√≥ria in 1811 (at the time he was 18 years old), a position he retained until his death. Complementing this role, he was an organ craftsman assistant, and called on to perform maintenance on organs throughout the island. =Liberal Wars= With the elevation of the S√£o Sebasti√£o to the status of municipality, he was elected secretary for the municipal chamber in 1822. It was also in this year that the new Portuguese constitutional framework would establish a liberal form of government. In the following year, the Vila-Francada in Portugal (1823) ushered in political persecution of constitutionalists, in which Terceira was not immune. Francisco Ferreira, as with others, saw themselves forced to escape, on 27 July, to the island of Santa Maria, then S√£o Miguel and Madeira, eventually terminating in Lisbon, where he remained exiled for less than a year. With the failure of Prince Miguel's Abrilada rebellion (30 April 1824), Francisco was able to return to Terceira. From there he participated in the struggles of the Portuguese Civil War (1828‚Äì1834), which he later described in the Anais da Ilha Terceira. =Later life= Returning to S√£o Sebasti√£o, he took on the position of secretary for orphans, then administrative secretary for the municipal council and notary. In 1836, he was elected President of the municipal government, a position he held for three years. During his tenure he defended the interests of an autonomous municipality, as well as guaranteeing the construction of aqueducts and channels to transport potable waters from the springs near Cabrito for mills. At the time it was the largest hydraulic public work in Terceira, and one of the largest in the Azores. In 1839, he was elected Solicitor General for the Junta Geral, while exercising for many more years the role of ombudsman for the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia. Ferreira Drummond also supported the fight against the extinction of the municipality of S√£o Sebasti√£o, and through his activity was able to delay its implementation from 24 October 1855 until 1 April 1870. He died at the age of 63, in the home offered by the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia along the Travessa da Miseric√≥rdia, in the Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o. In 1951, Francisco Ferreira Drummond was honoured a small monument in Rossio, Vila de S. Sebasti√£o.

Retrieved on October 7, 2009. Memorial serves students in portions of the Memorial and Spring Branch regions of Houston and several enclaves within the portions. Memorial is part of the Spring Branch Independent School District (SBISD) and serves grades 9 through 12. As of 2005, the district was granted a $500 million education grant, $150 million of which belongs to Memorial High School. History Memorial Senior High School opened in 1962 to relieve overcrowding at Spring Branch High School. Memorial was the second high school to open in SBISD. At the time, students living north of Old Katy Road attended Spring Branch and students living south of Old Katy Road attended Memorial. This arrangement lasted until Spring Woods High School opened in 1964. The design of the school was classic early 1960s in the South, with a large, open campus. Each classroom building opened into an outside breezeway, to maximize air flow as the school did not have air conditioning. When Memorial first opened, the area surrounding the school was largely forest and rice fields, but it rapidly grew as new subdivisions were built, and by the mid-1960s, Memorial's enrollment exceeded 3,000 students, a number much larger than the school was meant to hold. This problem was resolved with the opening of Westchester Senior High School in 1967,Hughes, Kim. \\"Westchester High all-alumni reunion planned for Nov. 10\\" (Archive). Houston Chronicle. November 4, 2007. Retrieved on June 25, 2015. and later Stratford Senior High School in 1974. At the time, Memorial's main rivals were the Spring Branch Bears and Westchester Wildcats. However, by the mid-1980s, the enrollment of nearly every school across the district had dropped precariously, and it was decided that Westchester and Spring Branch High Schools would be closed. Memorial remained open, and took in students from both Westchester and Spring Branch High Schools. Today, Memorial is the oldest high school still operating in Spring Branch ISD. The school has received extensive renovations, which began during the 1996‚Äì1997 school year. Every building in the school was gutted and refurbished, outdated facilities were replaced and the campus was made more secure.

Critics would claim that the event was racially insensitive to African-Americans and was an example of cultural appropriation due to the utilization of basketball jerseys, cornrows, do-rags, gang signs, and fake tattoos. Critics would range from media organizations and alumni to the local chapter of the NAACP. Memorial High would go on to cancel the 'spirit week' over the racist undertones of 'thug day' which the school claimed was an unofficial extension of the spirit week's 'jersey day.' Students went on to claim that campus tension increased as a result of the fallout, alongside mixed reception from alumni.

It was originally written by Timothy Van Zandt and has been maintained in recent years by Denis Girou, Sebastian Rahtz and Herbert Voss (de).  Basic usage  PSTricks example (scaled) There is a wide array of commands available for making graphics. Coordinates in PSTricks are always represented in parentheses, as the following example (scaled) illustrates: \\\\begin{pspicture}(5,5) %% Triangle in red: \\\\pspolygon[linecolor=red](1,1)(5,1)(1,4) %% Bezier curve in green: \\\\pscurve[linecolor=green,linewidth=2pt,% showpoints=true](5,5)(3,2)(4,4)(2,3) %% Circle in blue with radius 1: \\\\pscircle[linecolor=blue,linestyle=dashed](3,2.5){1} \\\\end{pspicture}  Extensions  sin(x) with pst-plot PSTricks commands are low level, so many LaTeX packages have been made in order to ease the creation of several kinds of graphics that are commonly used on mathematical typesetting. pst-plot provides commands for creating function graphs. Consider the following example: \\\\begin{pspicture*}(-7,-2)(7,2) \\\\psaxes[labels=none](0,0)(-7,-2)(7,2) % sets up axis \\\\psplot[linecolor=blue, linewidth=1.5pt]% % plots the sinewave {-7}{7}{x 0.01745329252 div sin} % notice the RPN expression \\\\uput[45](3.1415926,0){$\\\\pi$} % these are the labels \\\\uput[90](-1.570796,0){$-\\\\pi/2$} % \\\\uput is a box positioned at [angle] \\\\uput[-90](1.570796,0){$\\\\pi/2$} % relative to (x,y) coordinate \\\\uput[-135](-3.1415926,0){$-\\\\pi$} % and putting { content } on the box \\\\psline[linewidth=1pt,linecolor=red,linestyle=dotted]% % red dotted lines (1.57079632,1)(1.57079632,0) \\\\psline[linewidth=1pt,linecolor=red,linestyle=dotted]% (-1.57079632,-1)(-1.57079632,0) \\\\end{pspicture*} The previous example also illustrate that TeX commands can be used as elements into the pictures. Since PostScript uses RPN style for mathematical operations, the argument to pst- plot must be supplied in the same form. An alternative is to use the optional argument algebraic, then the formula can be described as an algebraic expression. pstricks-add extends pst-plot enabling also polar graphs and allowing the use algebraic notation for plots instead of RPN. pst-math provides trigonometric functions in radians (since PostScript defaults to using degrees) and hyperbolic trigonometric functions. pst-3dplot is used for creating 3D graphics like the following: Hyperbolic paraboloid drawn using PSTricks package pst-3dplot multido provides basic loop functionality for programming graphs with repeating elements: Plotting a graph while varying parameters with multido pst-eucl is a beta extension for easy creation of geometrical drawings. Circumcircle of a triangle, illustrated with pst-eucl There are many other extensions, for drawing Circuit diagrams, barcodes, graphs, trees, visualizing data, etc.  Compatibility  PSTricks is only fully compatible with TeX systems using PostScript intermediates, including but not limited to eTeX and others. However, it is not compatible with the widely used pdfTeX engine in PDF mode. As pdfTeX is the default engine in most current installations, users of PSTricks must either force pdfTeX to DVI mode or use auto-pst-pdf.

It is synthesized only in neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing cell bodies located in the ventromedial part of the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus. AgRP is co- expressed with NPY and acts to increase appetite and decrease metabolism and energy expenditure. It is one of the most potent and long-lasting of appetite stimulators. In humans, the agouti-related peptide is encoded by the AGRP gene. Structure AgRP is a paracrine signalling molecule made up of 112 amino acids (the gene product of 132 amino acids is processed by removal of the N-terminal 20-residue signal peptide domain). It was independently identified by two teams in 1997 based on its sequence similarity with agouti signalling peptide (ASIP), a protein synthesised in the skin that controls coat colour. AgRP is approximately 25% identical to ASIP. The murine homologue of AgRP consists of 111 amino acids (precursor is 131 amino acids) and shares 81% amino acid identity with the human protein. Biochemical studies indicate AgRP to be very stable to thermal denaturation and acid degradation. Its secondary structure consists mainly of random coils and Œ≤-sheets that fold into an inhibitor cystine knot motif. AGRP maps to human chromosome 16q22 and Agrp to mouse chromosome 8D1-D2.  Function  Agouti-related protein is expressed primarily in the adrenal gland, subthalamic nucleus, and hypothalamus, with lower levels of expression in the testis, kidneys, and lungs. The appetite-stimulating effects of AgRP are inhibited by the hormone leptin and activated by the hormone ghrelin. Adipocytes secrete leptin in response to food intake. This hormone acts in the arcuate nucleus and inhibits the AgRP/NPY neuron from releasing orexigenic peptides. Ghrelin has receptors on NPY/AgRP neurons that stimulate the secretion of NPY and AgRP to increase appetite. AgRP is stored in intracellular secretory granules and is secreted via a regulated pathway. The transcriptional and secretory action of AgRP is regulated by inflammatory signals. Levels of AgRP are increased during periods of fasting. It has been found that AgRP stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortical axis to release ACTH, cortisol and prolactin. It also enhances the ACTH response to IL-1-beta, suggesting it may play a role in the modulation of neuroendocrine response to inflammation. Conversely, AgRP- secreting neurons inhibit the release of TRH from the PVN, which may contribute to conservation of energy in starvation. This pathway is part of a feedback loop, since TRH-secreting neurons from PVN stimulate AgRP neurons. Mechanism AGRP has been demonstrated to be an inverse agonist of melanocortin receptors, to be specific MC3-R and MC4-R. The melanocortin receptors, MC3-R and MC4-R, are directly linked to metabolism and body weight control. These receptors are activated by the peptide hormone Œ±-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and antagonized by the agouti-related protein. Whereas Œ±-MSH acts broadly on most members of the MCR family (with the exception of MC2-R), AGRP is highly specific for only MC3-R and MC4-R. This inverse agonism not only antagonizes the action of melanocortin agonists such as Œ±-MSH but also further decreases the cAMP produced by the affected cells. The exact mechanism by which AgRP inhibits melanocortin-receptor signalling is not completely clear. It has been suggested that Agouti-related protein binds MSH receptors and acts as a competitive antagonist of ligand binding. Studies of Agouti protein in B16 melanoma cells supported this logic. The expression of AgRP in the adrenal gland is regulated by glucocorticoids. The protein blocks Œ±-MSH-induced secretion of corticosterone. History Orthologs of AgRP, ASIP, MCIR, and MC4R have been found in mammalian, teleost fish, and avian genomes. This suggests that the agouti-melanocortin system evolved by gene duplication from individual ligand and receptor genes in the last 500 million years. Role in obesity AgRP induces obesity by chronic antagonism of the MC4-R. Overexpression of AgRP in transgenic mice (or intracerebroventricular injection) causes hyperphagia and obesity, whilst AgRP plasma levels have been found to be elevated in obese human males. Understanding the role AgRP plays in weight gain may assist in developing pharmaceutical models for treating obesity. AgRP mRNA levels have been found to be down regulated following an acute stressful event. Studies suggest that systems involved in the regulation of stress response and of energy balance are highly integrated. Loss or gain of AgRP function may result in inadequate adaptive behavioural responses to environmental events, such as stress, and have potential to contribute to the development of eating disorders. It has been shown that polymorphisms in the AgRP gene have been linked with anorexia nervosa as well as obesity. Some studies suggest that inadequate signalling of AgRP during stress may result in binge eating. Starvation-induced hypothalamic autophagy generates free fatty acids, which in turn regulate neuronal AgRP levels.

Before that religious toleration was provided for by the constitution of the Kingdom of Italy which in turn derived from the Albertine Statute granted by Carlo Alberto of the Kingdom of Sardinia to his subjects in 1848, the Year of Revolutions. History Article 1 of the Albertine Statute identified Roman Catholicism as the single religion of state but declared that other existing confessions were tolerated in conformance with the laws.'La Religione Cattolica, Apostolica e Romana √® la sola Religione dello Stato. Gli altri culti ora esistenti sono tollerati conformemente alle leggi.' Article 1 of the Statuto albertino. Full text of the Statuto from Wikisource. This declaration led rapidly to the opening of the ghettoes and the emancipation of the Waldensians. Toleration was limited however: Article 28, while declaring that there should be a free press, stated specifically that Bibles, catechisms, liturgies and prayer books could not be printed without episcopal permission; religious propaganda was also prohibited by the state.Domenico Maselli, ‚ÄòBreve scheda sulle Intese tra lo Stato e le Confessioni Religiose diverse dalla Cattolica‚Äô , Unione Buddhista Italiana, June 2008. Nevertheless, in the years leading up to the unification of Italy the Kingdom of Sardinia was more tolerant than other states on the peninsula: in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany the practice of religions other than Catholicism was punishable by imprisonment or exile. The Kingdom of Italy inherited in effect the Piedmontese-Sardinian constitution and on 18 March 1871 a major advance in religious freedom in the country was made by an order of the day introduced by the liberal reformist Pasquale Stanislao Mancini which established that all religions should be treated equally. The Fascist period was marked by the Concordat between the state and the Catholic Church, known as the Lateran treaty of 1929. Other Christian denominations and other religions, however, faced renewed repression. In 1935 the Pentecostals were declared prejudicial to the integrity of the race. Salvationists and Jehova's Witnesses, as well as the Pentecostals were liable to imprisonment or exile while other minority Christian groups faced notable restrictions. Although antisemitism was not embedded in Italian Fascism from the start, in order to please his ally Adolf Hitler, in the late 1930s Benito Mussolini approved the Italian Racial Laws. In the latter stages of World War II, in particular during the period of the Italian Social Republic and of German occupation of much of the peninsula, many Jews, as well as non-jew political dissidents and even Catholic priests, were deported to the Nazi death camps. The 1947 Constitution of the Italian Republic enshrined religious freedoms in passages including the following: Various laws enacted during the Fascist period remained in force, however, and a number of trials took place involving Pentecostals and Jehova's Witnesses. This changed in 1955 with the advent of the Constitutional Court which abolished or modified legislation on relevant matters which it found inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of religious freedom. In 1984, following a revised accord with the Vatican, Catholicism lost its status as the official religion of the Italian state‚ÄòItaly school crucifixes ‚Äúbarred‚Äù‚Äô, BBC News, 3 November 2009. and Italy became a secular state. Controversy however remains, particularly abroad, over certain Fascist-era laws that are still in force and that have not been declared unconstitutional. In 2009 the European Court of Human Rights, in a case brought by an Italian mother who wanted her children to have a secular education, ruled against the display of crucifixes in the classrooms of Italian state schools. It found that 'The compulsory display of a symbol of a given confession in premises used by the public authorities‚Ä¶ restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions' and that it restricted the 'right of children to believe or not to believe'. This ruling was in marked contrast with the position of the Italian courts that had ruled in 2005 that crucifixes were allowed to be present in polling stations and, in 2006, that display of crucifixes in state schools was allowed on the basis that the crucifix symbolised core Italian social values.Laura Barnett, ‚ÄòFreedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere‚Äô, Law and Government Division of the Canadian Parliament, 2008. Freedom of religion in Italy today Italy is a predominantly Roman Catholic country, with minorities of Muslims (mostly from recent immigration), Sikhs and Jews. Christian Protestants are historically few. A few Protestants, such as two-time Prime Minister Sidney Sonnino, have distinguished themselves. 97.67% of Italians are baptised according to the rite of the Catholic Church. According to a survey of Eurispes 2006,http://www.cesnur.org/2001/enc/aggsoc072001.htm 87.8% of the population declares itself Catholic and 36.8% practitioner. However a large percentage of Catholics do not necessarily support all the directions of the Church, as demonstrated by the referendum about divorce or abortion. The Catholic Church was the State church until it was de facto disestablished with the 1948 Constitution, then definitely with the 1984 revision of the Lateran Treaty. Now Italy is a secular state. In Italy in 2006 there were 53 million Christians, 4 million Atheists and Agnostics, 1.2 million Muslims, 160,000 Buddhists, 115,000 Hindus, 70,000 Sikhs, 45,000 Jews and 15,000 Pagans. The Catholic Church holds considerable influence on some political parties. The fact that the Roman Catholic Church has a direct influence on political parties is object of controversy among those who favour the independence of politics and in particular among those whose views on divorce, abortion, euthanasia and same-sex marriages are opposed to Christian ethics and in particular to Catholic doctrine. Usage of Catholic symbolism (especially crosses) in courts and schools has been contested by minorities, but was ruled legal; some contend that this is in violation of the principles of religious freedom outlined in the Constitution of Italy.

Deering was a five-masted commercial schooner that was found run aground off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in 1921 with the crew nowhere to be found. The Deering is one of the most written-about maritime mysteries in history, with claims that it was a victim of the Bermuda Triangle, although the evidence points towards a mutiny or possibly piracy. Overview The Carroll A. Deering was built in Bath, Maine, in 1919 by the G.G. Deering Company for commercial use. The owner of the company named the ship after his son. One of the last large commercial sailing vessels, the ship was designed to carry cargo and had been in service for a year when it began its final voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Deering‚Äôs last voyage On July 19, 1920, the Deering sailing from Puerto Rico arrived at Newport News, to pick up a cargo of coal for delivery to Rio de Janeiro. The ship was captained by William H. Merritt. Merritt was a hero of World War I who had been cited for bravery under fire for saving his entire crew when his previous command, the Deering-built five-masted Schooner Dorothy B. Barrett, was sunk by the German submarine U-117 off Cape May, New Jersey in 1918. Merritt's son, Sewall, was his first mate and he had a ten-man crew made up entirely of Scandinavians (mostly Danes). On August 26, 1920, the Deering cleared the Virginia Capes bound for Rio, but Captain Merritt soon fell seriously ill and the Deering turned back and put into the port of Lewes, Delaware to drop off Merritt and his son. The Deering Company recruited Captain Willis B. Wormell, a retired 66-year-old veteran sea captain, to replace him on the voyage to Brazil. Charles B. McLellan was hired on as first mate. The Deering with Wormell in command set sail for Rio on September 8, 1920, arriving there and delivering its cargo without incident. Wormell gave his crew leave and met with a Captain Goodwin, an old friend who captained another cargo vessel that was docked in Rio. Wormell spoke of his crew with disdain, though he claimed to trust the engineer, Herbert Bates, whom Goodwin was acquainted with as well.Graveyard of the Atlantic page The Deering left Rio on December 2, 1920, and stopped for supplies in Barbados. First Mate McLellan got drunk in town and complained to Captain Hugh Norton of the Snow that he could not discipline the crew without Wormell interfering, and that he had to do all the navigation owing to Wormell's poor eyesight. Later Captain Norton, his first mate and another captain were in the Continental Caf√© and heard McLellan say, \\"I'll get the captain before we get to Norfolk, I will.\\" McLellan was arrested in a drunken state, but on January 9 Wormell forgave him, bailed him out of jail, and set sail for Hampton Roads.Bland (2005) p60 The ship was next sighted by the Cape Lookout lightship off North Carolina on January 28, 1921, when the Deering hailed it. The lightship's keeper, Captain Jacobson, reported that a tall thin man with reddish hair and a foreign accent speaking through a megaphone told him the vessel had lost its anchors in a storm off Cape Fear and asked that the ship's owners, the G.G. Deering Company, be notified. Jacobson took note of this, but his radio was out, so he was unable to report it. He also noticed that the crew seemed to be \\"milling around\\" on the quarterdeck of the ship, an area where they were usually not allowed. The following afternoon, the crew of another vessel transiting the area spotted the Deering sailing a course that would take it directly onto the Diamond Shoals. They, however, saw no one on the ship's decks and didn't attempt to hail the schooner, assuming her crew would spot the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse or the Diamond Shoals Lightship and change course to avoid wrecking on the shoals.http://www.historicalblindness.com/blogandpodcast//the-carroll-a- deering-ghost-ship-of-cape-hatteras The wreck On January 31, 1921, the Deering was sighted at dawn by surfman C.P. Brady who was on lookout duty at the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras. The vessel was hard aground with all sails set on the outer edge of Diamond Shoals. These shoals that extend offshore from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina have been notorious as a common site of shipwrecks for centuries and are known as the \\"Graveyard of the Atlantic\\". Rescue ships were unable to approach the vessel owing to bad weather. The ship was not boarded until February 4, after being battered by the surf for several days, and it became clear that the schooner had been completely abandoned. Her steering equipment was found to be damaged, with the wheel shattered, the binnacle box stove in, and the rudder disengaged from its stock. The ship's log and navigation equipment were gone, along with the crew's personal effects and the ship's two lifeboats. In the vessel's galley it appeared that certain foodstuffs were being prepared for the next day's meal at the time of the abandonment. The Coast Guard cutter Manning attempted to salvage the Deering, but found this impossible. The vessel was declared a hazard to navigation, and was destroyed using dynamite explosives on March 4 to prevent it from becoming a danger to other vessels. A portion of the ship's bow later drifted ashore on Ocracoke island. Wooden timbers from the wreck also washed ashore on Hatteras Island, and were used by local residents to build houses.https://www.southernliving.com/culture/carroll-a-deering-ghost- ship-of-the-outer-banks Investigation The U.S. government launched an extensive investigation into the disappearance of the crew of the Deering. Five departments of the government--Commerce, Treasury, Justice, Navy, and State--looked into the case. Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, was intrigued by the fact that several other vessels of various nationalities-- most notably the sulfur freighter Hewitt--had also disappeared in roughly the same area. Although most of these vessels were later revealed to have been sailing in the vicinity of a series of particularly powerful hurricanes, the Hewitt and Deering were proven to have been sailing away from the area of the storm at the time. Hoover's assistant, Lawrence Ritchey, was placed in charge of the investigation. Ritchey tried to chart what happened to the vessel between its last sighting at Cape Lookout and its running aground at Diamond Shoals by reading the log books of the Coast Guard lightships stationed in those areas. When an Italian inquiry into the disappearance of the vessel Monte San Michele confirmed that there had been strong hurricanes in the vicinity, mutiny was then accepted as the explanation for the Deering incident. The investigation was closed in late 1922 without an official finding on the incident. Speculation There were a number of rumors about the incident. It seemed at first that an external force was responsible for the disappearance of the crew. On April 11, 1921, a local fisherman named Christopher Columbus Gray claimed to have found a message in a bottle floating in the waters off Buxton Beach, North Carolina; he swiftly turned it over to the authorities. The text of the message was as follows: > DEERING CAPTURED BY OIL BURNING BOAT SOMETHING LIKE CHASER. TAKING OFF > EVERYTHING HANDCUFFING CREW. CREW HIDING ALL OVER SHIP NO CHANCE TO MAKE > ESCAPE. FINDER PLEASE NOTIFY HEADQUARTERS DEERING. The handwriting in the letter was identified as that of the ship's engineer, Bates, by the widow of Captain Wormell, and the bottle was proven to have been manufactured in Brazil. This, along with a sighting of a \\"mysterious\\" steamer that arrived at the Cape Lookout lightship in the wake of the Deering, suggested hostile action. The captain of the lightship had attempted to hail the steamer to get its crew to relay the message from the Deering but the steamer failed to respond and he could not make out the ship's name. The message also raised skepticism: if a crew member did manage to get hold of paper, pen, and bottle and write a letter, why would he request that the company be notified, as opposed to the police or Coast Guard? However, hand writing experts later believed the message was forged and, after further questioning by federal agents, Christopher Gray later admitted to the forgery.Bland (2003) p176-179 Gray apparently forged the note in hopes that the publicity he would garner from finding it would help him secure employment at the Cape Hatteras Light station. The following theories were considered by the U.S. government in its investigation: *Hurricanes: The U.S. government, particularly the Weather Bureau, strongly advocated a series of powerful hurricanes known to have been raging in the Atlantic as the cause of the disappearances. As mentioned above, however, both the Deering and the Hewitt were heading away from the path of these storms. In any case, several authors, including Larry Kusche and Richard Winer, have pointed out that the state of the ship indicates an orderly rather than panicked evacuation. *Piracy: Captain O.W. Parker of the United States Marine Shipping Board certainly believed piracy responsible; he stated that, in his opinion, \\"Piracy without a doubt still exists as it has since the days of the Phoenicians\\". Captain Wormell's widow was a particularly strong advocate of this theory. It was believed that a group of pirates were responsible for the various disappearances; however, no real evidence of this theory emerged, and no suspected pirates were ever caught. *Russian/Communist Piracy: During a police raid on the headquarters of the United Russian Workers Party (a Communist front group) in New York City, officers found papers that called on members of the organization to seize American ships and sail them to the Soviet Union. These papers indicated that a Communist plot was afoot, and was circumstantially linked to several shipboard strikes the previous year. This was widely believed in regard to the Deering at the time, particularly by hardline anti-communists in the government. Although an intriguing suggestion, no definitive proof that any of these activities were actually carried out has surfaced. *Rum Runners: A similar theory to the above speculates that a group of liquor smugglers working out of the Bahamas stole the ship to use as a rum- running vessel (this was during the Prohibition era). The Deering was large enough, according to Richard Winer's Ghost Ships, to carry roughly a million dollars' worth of liquor in her hold. On the other hand, it is doubtful that such a conspicuous, easily identifiable and comparatively slow vessel would constitute a choice target for smugglers. *Mutiny: Wormell's known conflict with his first mate and derisive comments towards his crew while in Rio de Janeiro suggested that something may have been amiss between the captain and his men on the voyage. Captain Jacobson at Cape Lookout certainly thought it odd; the man who hailed his vessel was definitely not Captain Wormell, and he was not an officer by all accounts. Senator Frederick Hale of Maine advocated this theory, stating it was \\"a plain case of mutiny\\". Discontent with the captain could certainly have caused a mutiny of the crew, but once again, nothing definitive has ever been proven. *Paranormal Explanation: The disappearance of the ship's crew has been cited by innumerable authors dealing with anomalous phenomena and the supernatural. Charles Fort, in his book Lo! (1931), first mentioned this vessel in a \\"mysterious\\" context, and many subsequent chroniclers of sea mysteries have followed suit. Since this vessel sailed in the area generally considered to be part of the so-called Bermuda Triangle, the disappearance of the crew has often been tied to this fact.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . However the ship's resting place (Diamond Shoals) and its last known point of sighting and communication (Cape Lookout) are several hundred miles away from the area generally known as the Bermuda Triangle. Conclusion No official explanation for the disappearance of the crew of the Carroll A. Deering was ever offered, though all of the concrete evidence suggests mutiny. The case is a favorite of paranormal and Bermuda Triangle hobbyists and has gained a reputation as one of the truly great maritime mysteries. It is also possible that the Deering's crew simply abandoned ship after the vessel grounded on Diamond Shoals and, unable to row to shore, were swept out to sea and to certain death in their small open lifeboats. When the Coast Guard boarded the Deering they found that distress signals, two red lights high in the rigging, had been lit. The steamer Hewitt that was known to be in the area could have sighted the distress signals and taken the crew of the Deering aboard. The Hewitt was later lost with all hands so it is possible that the Deering crew may have gone down with it.https://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/article_7921af1b-1d96-5bb9-b3ec- bbab9f2fc670.html Artifacts The ship's bell and capstan from the Carrol A.

It has a strong ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste, making h√°karl an acquired taste. Fermented shark is readily available in Icelandic stores and may be eaten year-round, but is most often served as part of a √æorramatur, a selection of traditional Icelandic food served at the midwinter festival √æorrabl√≥t. Consumption Fermented shark in a store Fermented shark contains a large amount of ammonia and has a strong smell, similar to many cleaning products. It is often served in cubes on toothpicks. Those new to it may gag involuntarily on the first attempt to eat it because of the high ammonia content. First-timers are sometimes advised to pinch their nose while taking the first bite, as the smell is much stronger than the taste. It is often eaten with a shot of the local spirit, a type of akvavit called brenniv√≠n. It comes in two varieties; chewy and reddish glerh√°karl (lit. \\"glassy shark\\") from the belly, and white and soft skyrh√°karl (lit. \\"skyr shark\\") from the body. Preparation The meat of the Greenland shark is poisonous when fresh because of its high content of urea and trimethylamine oxide. Properly processed, however, it may be consumed. The traditional method begins with gutting and beheading a shark and placing it in a shallow hole dug in gravelly sand, with the now cleaned cavity resting on a small mound of sand. The shark is then covered with sand and gravel, and stones are placed on top of the sand in order to press the shark so that the fluids are pressed out of the body. The shark ferments in this fashion for 6‚Äì12 weeks depending on the season. Following this curing period, the shark is then cut into strips and hung to dry for several months. During this drying period a brown crust will develop, which is removed prior to cutting the shark into small pieces and serving. It is possible to witness the traditional preparation process at Bjarnarh√∂fn Shark Museum on Sn√¶fellsnes.Bjarnarh√∂fn Shark Museum . The modern method is simply to press the shark's meat in a large plastic container, into which drain holes have been cut. Reactions from outside Iceland Chef Anthony Bourdain described fermented shark as \\"the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing\\" he had ever eaten. Chef Gordon Ramsay challenged James May to sample three \\"delicacies\\" (Laotian snake whiskey, bull penis, and fermented shark) on The F Word; after eating fermented shark, Ramsay spat it out, but May was able to keep his down. May even offered to eat it again. On season two's Iceland episode of Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Andrew Zimmern described the smell as reminding him of \\"some of the most horrific things I've ever breathed in my life,\\" but said it tasted much better than it smelled. He described the taste as \\"sweet, nutty and only faintly fishy.\\" Nonetheless, he did note of fermented shark: \\"That's hardcore. That's serious food. You don't want to mess with that. That's not for beginners.\\" In one of season five's final episodes of Animal Planet's River Monsters, Biologist and Angler Jeremy Wade mentions that the flesh \\"smells of urine\\" that has \\"a really strong aftertaste, it really kicks in. It really kicks in at the back of the throat after you take the first bite.\\" He further states that the meat was really unlike anything he's tried before; that it is like really strong cheese but with a definite fish element. Archaeologist Neil Oliver tasted it in the BBC documentary Vikings as part of examining the Viking diet. He described it as reminiscent of \\"blue cheese but a hundred times stronger\\". Chef Ainsley Harriott, during his series Ainsley Eats the Streets, was unable to handle the heavy ammonia taste and described it as \\"like chewing a urine-infested mattress\\".

Cultivation and uses Acer griseum was introduced to cultivation in Europe in 1901 by Ernest Henry Wilson for the Veitch Nurseries, and to North America shortly after. It is one of many species of maples widely grown as ornamental plants in temperate regions. It is admired for its decorative exfoliating bark, translucent pieces of which often stay attached to the branches until worn away. It also has spectacular autumn foliage which can include red, orange and pink tones. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In 2015, the North America-China Plant Exploration Consortium (NACPEC) conducted an expedition specifically targeting Acer griseum for seed collection with the object of increasing the genetic diversity of plants in cultivation. Propagation of Acer griseum is somewhat difficult as seeds have the same parthenocarpic tendencies as those of Acer maximowiczianum.van Gelderen, C. J., & van Gelderen, D. M. (1999).

A pioneer of this field was James J. Gibson. A major study was that of affordances, i.e. the perceived utility of objects in, or features of, one's surroundings. According to Gibson, such features or objects were perceived as affordances and not as separate or distinct objects in themselves. This view was central to several other fields as software user interface and usability engineering, environmentalism in psychology, and ultimately to political economy where the perceptual view was used to explain the omission of key inputs or consequences of economic transactions, i.e. resources and wastes. Gerard Egan and Robert Bolton explored areas of interpersonal interactions based on the premise that people act in accordance with their perception of a given situation. While behaviour is obvious, a person's thoughts and feelings are masked. This gives rise to the idea that the most common problems between people are based on the assumption that we can guess what the other person is feeling and thinking. They also offered methods, within this scope, for effective communications. This includes: reflective listening, assertion skills, conflict resolution etc. Perceptual psychology is often used in therapy to help a patient better their problem- solving skills.  Nativism vs. empiricism  Nativist and empiricist approaches to perceptual psychology have been researched and debated to find out which is the basis in the development of perception. Nativists believe humans are born with all the perceptual abilities needed. Nativism is the favored theory on perception. Empiricists hold that humans are not born with perceptual abilities, but instead must learn them.

It is the identification (or \\"tagging\\") of jets originating from bottom quarks (or b quarks, hence the name). Importance b-tagging is important because: * The physics of bottom quarks is quite interesting; in particular, it sheds light on CP violation. * Some important high-mass particles (both recently discovered and hypothetical) decay into bottom quarks. Top quarks very nearly always do so, and the Higgs boson is expected to decay into bottom quarks more than any other particle given its mass has been observed to be about 125 GeV. Identifying bottom quarks helps to identify the decays of these particles. Methods Diagram showing the common principle of identification of jets initiated by b-hadron decays The methods for b-tagging are based on the unique features of b-jets. These include: *Hadrons containing bottom quarks have sufficient lifetime that they travel some distance before decaying. On the other hand, their lifetimes are not so high as those of light quark hadrons, so they decay inside the detector rather than escape. The advent of precision silicon detectors within particle detectors has made it possible to identify particles that originate from a place different to where the bottom quark was formed (e.g. the beam‚Äìbeam collision point in a particle accelerator), and thus indicating the likely presence of a b-jet. * The bottom quark is much more massive than anything it decays into. Thus its decay products tend to have higher transverse momentum (momentum perpendicular to the original direction of the bottom quark, and therefore of the b-jet). This causes b-jets to be wider, have higher multiplicities (numbers of constituent particles) and invariant masses, and also to contain low-energy leptons with momentum perpendicular to the jet. These two features can be measured, and jets that have them are more likely to be b-jets. * Opposite-side algorithms have been used at the LHCb to tag the flavor in pairs of b quarks using the decay products of B-hadrons to infer the flavor of B-mesons. None of the methods of identifying b-jets are foolproof, and modern particle physics experiments must devote significant time to studying how often they successfully identify b-jets and how often they misidentify other jets. Monte Carlo simulations are used to develop and evaluate the performance of tagging algorithms. Experiments making precise measurements of B mesons (mesons containing b-quarks) also try to identify the particular initial B meson within the jet. This is done in order to observe the oscillation of one meson into another (‚Äì oscillation), which allows the measurement of CP violation.

The book features extensive portraits of the battle's participants, including General George Armstrong Custer, Sitting Bull, Major Marcus Reno, Captain Frederick Benteen, Crazy Horse, and others. Originally intending to write a book of essays about the history of the American West, Connell instead developed his essay about General Custer into a book-length examination of the battle and its combatants. Connell researched the book for four years, visiting the site of the battle four times and consulting previous books, soldier's diaries, and Indian accounts of the battle. After being rejected by several major New York publishers, the book was published by North Point Press, a small publisher in Berkeley, California, and it went on to become a bestseller. The book was a critical success as well. Page Stenger in the New York Times said that the book was \\"impressive in its massive presentation of information\\" and added that \\"its prose is elegant, its tone the voice of dry wit, its meandering narrative skillfully crafted.\\" The Washington Post's reviewer said that \\"Son of the Morning Star leaves the reader astonished,\\" and the Wall Street Journal called it \\"a scintillating book, thoroughly researched and brilliantly constructed.\\" It was named one of the five best nonfiction volumes of 1984 by the National Book Critics Circle.

He composed most of the songs for the band, including the hit singles \\"In the Summertime\\", \\"Baby Jump\\", \\"Lady Rose\\", \\"You Don't Have to Be in the Army to Fight in the War\\", \\"Long Legged Woman Dressed in Black\\", and \\"Hello Nadine\\", plus \\"Feels Like I'm in Love\\", a number one hit single for the Scottish disco singer, Kelly Marie. Early life Dorset attended Stanwell Road School (which was renamed Abbotsford County Secondary School) and then Southall Grammar School from the age of 13 after passing an exam. He formed The Blue Moon Skiffle Group as a teenager. He worked as an apprentice hairdresser for nine months after leaving the school without qualifications. After this he studied for a City and Guilds qualification at Twickenham College of Technology and worked for Radio Control Specialists Ltd, National Works, Bath Road, Hounslow, a firm that manufactured Radio Control equipment for models and film work as well as electro-mechanical components. Music career In 1968, Dorset formed the group Good Earth, which included Colin Earl on keyboards, Dave Hutchins on bass, and Ray Bowerman on drums. They recorded the album It's Hard Rock And All That on the Saga record label, before Hutchins and Bowerman left. Joe Rush joined on washboard and the group adopted a more acoustic-based skiffle style. In 1970, with further line-up changes, the group became Mungo Jerry with hits to follow such as \\"In the Summertime\\". The song took Dorset only ten minutes to compose on a second-hand Fender Stratocaster while he was taking time off work from his regular job, working in a laboratory for Timex. Dorset has also maintained a solo career parallel to his leadership of Mungo Jerry. In 1972, he released the album Cold Blue Excursion, made up entirely of self-penned songs, many featuring strings and brass accompaniment. In 1983, he was part of one-off blues outfit Katmandu with Peter Green and Vincent Crane, who recorded an album A Case for the Blues. In 1986, billed as 'Made in England', he recorded and released the theme tune for the TV drama series Prospects, which was also released as a single. One song recorded by Mungo Jerry, \\"Feels Like I'm in Love\\", was originally written by Dorset for Elvis Presley, who died before the song could be recorded. Nevertheless, in 1979 it was recorded by the Scottish disco singer Kelly Marie, and became a UK Number one in September 1980. This made Dorset one of the first songwriters to top the UK Singles Chart with singles performed by himself, and by another musician. Later disputes In 2012, Dorset sued his former management company Associated Music International (AMI), run by his former friend and business manager Eliot Cohen, claiming over ¬£2 million in royalties from the song that he believed had been withheld from him.

Personal life A father of six, Dorset lives with his third wife, Britta, in Bournemouth, Dorset. Interviewed in 2014, Dorset said, \\"Each of my three marriages has produced two children and I also have three grandchildren. I married my present wife, Britta, in 1995.

Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/waif (accessed: June 02, 2008) is a living creature removed, by hardship, loss or other helpless circumstance, from its original surroundings. The most common usage of the word is to designate a homeless, forsaken or orphaned child, or someone whose appearance is evocative of the same. As such, the term is similar to a ragamuffin or street urchin, although the main distinction is volitional: a runaway youth might live on the streets, but would not properly be called a waif as the departure from one's home was an exercise of free will. Likewise, a person fleeing their home for purposes of safety (as in response to political oppression or natural disaster), is typically considered not a waif but a refugee. Literature Orphaned children, left to fend for themselves, are common as literary protagonists, especially in children's and fantasy literature. The characters Heathcliff in Emily Bront√´'s 1847 novel Wuthering Heights and Jo, the crossing sweeper in Charles Dickens' 1852 novel Bleak House are waifs. Dickens, it may be noted, has been called \\"the Master of Waif Literature.\\" Bret Harte's 1890 novel A Waif of the Plains, set against the backdrop of the Oregon Trail in the 1850s, is another example. The children in A Series of Unfortunate Events are usually waifs, in between their unsuccessful stints in the care of various relatives. In modern adult fantasy writing, it could be argued that Kvothe of Patrick Rothfuss's The Kingkiller Chronicle (The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear) was a waif, and the stories include many flashback elements ‚Äì as they are of Kvothe's life told by Kvothe ‚Äì to the time when he indeed was a waif. Literary waifs are frequently depicted with a frail appearance, although such physical aspects are not inherent in the term. Such evocations may reflect the endemic malnutrition of the street urchin. Chicago's Mercy Home for Boys and Girls, a long-term residential home for troubled young men and women from the streets and abusive homes, has published The Waif's Messenger for more than 100 years. A cartoon waif, an orphan boy, appeared in the 1936 Rainbow Parade cartoon A Waif's Welcome. Nautical In nautical terms, a waif is any survivor of a shipwreck compelled to make land upon a foreign shore. In this sense waif is roughly synonymous with castaway, although the latter term is generally associated with isolation; a waif (in the nautical sense) usually indicates a survivor of a marine disaster who has fallen into the care or custody of others. > \\"Some seven years ago...there appeared the remarkable saga of Manjiro, the > shipwrecked Japanese waif who was rescued and brought to the United States > by a Yankee whaling captain.\\"AmericanHeritage.com / The Ordeal of the KANRIN > MARU Legal Dating from the Middle Ages, when a woman was proscribed and subjected to penalties of outlawry, she was said to be ‚Äúwaived‚Äù and called a \\"waif\\". This waiving of the law was tantamount to outlawry since it removed all protection of the law. Women in this status were outside of the \\"law\\", and as with male outlaws, others could kill them on sight as if they were wild animals. Under British common law, items stolen by a thief and discarded during the thief's flight are \\"waifs.\\" The monarch owns such waifs by royal prerogative. Music References to waifs in music are sometimes self- deprecating, as in the name of the Australian folk-rock band The Waifs, or Tracy Bonham's song \\"I'm Not a Waif\\". Many other songs use the word \\"waif\\" to romanticize street children and runaways, as in the Marc Almond song \\"Waifs and Strays\\", or the Steely Dan song \\"Janie Runaway\\", which describes the title character as being the \\"wonderwaif of Gramercy Park\\". The song \\"Black and White Sunshine\\" from the Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds album Who Built the Moon? contains the lyric \\"these are the glory days for the waifs and the strays\\". Frank Turner's 2019 song \\"Jinny Bingham's Ghost\\" contains the lyrics \\"Be sure to raise a toast. To the patron saint of the waifs and strays. To Jinny Bingham's ghost\\". Botany In botany, a \\"waif\\" is an unusual species found in the wild that is alien and either a) is unsuccessful at reproduction without human intervention, or b) only persists a few generations and disappears. Such a plant never gets \\"naturalized\\" in the wild. \\"Waif flora\\" also refers to plant species which occur on oceanic islands due to chance long-distance dispersion of seeds. Fashion In fashion and related popular culture, the term \\"waif\\" is commonly used to describe a very thin person, usually a woman. \\"The waif look\\" was used in the 1960s to describe thin, large-eyed models such as Twiggy, and Edie Sedgwick. and December 22, 1968, page 24. The \\"gamine\\" look of the 1950s, associated with actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Leslie Caron and Jean Seberg, was, to some extent, a precursor. The term \\"waif\\" was seemingly ubiquitous in the 1990s, with heroin chic fashion and models such as Kate Moss and Jaime King on the runways and in advertisements. Actresses such as Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart, Winona Ryder, recently the British actress Keira Knightley and singer Celine Dion have all been pinned with the term. Although the heroin chic look has gone out of fashion, it still holds some popularity in Hollywood. For example, Wonderbra model Eva Herzigov√° was criticized over her waif-like figure.

Svenson (May 8, 1910 - August 21, 1975) was an American children's author, publisher, and partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate. Under a variety of pseudonyms, many shared with other authors, Svenson authored or coauthored more than 70 books for children, including books for the Hardy Boys, Bobbsey Twins, Tom Swift, and Honey Bunch series. He wrote the series The Happy Hollisters using the pseudonym Jerry West and The Tolliver Family as Alan Stone. Early life Svenson was born in Belleville, New Jersey, in 1910 to parents Sven Andrew Svenson and Laura (Soleau) Svenson. He was the oldest of three children. Younger brother Arthur grew up to become a professor of business management at New York University, and younger sister Marjorie became a Registered Nurse. The family moved to Newark, New Jersey, and Svenson attended Barringer High School in Newark. He was athletic, and competed as a sprinter in high school, and later in college. College Svenson began to study Engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), before realizing that Mathematics was not his forte. He transferred to University of Pittsburgh, where he focused on his writing, and graduated in 1932. After his first year of college, he embarked on a cross country adventure with his younger brother Arthur. The two purchased an ancient car (rumored to be a Model T), which carried them from New Jersey to Montana, before the wheels literally fell off. The two brothers hitch-hiked to Seattle, where they boarded a tramp steamer headed back to the East Coast, via the Panama Canal. They stopped in Cuba before finally arriving home. Some have suggested that this trip inspired future Hardy Boys books. Marriage Svenson met his wife while attending college. Marian Stewart was the adopted daughter of wealthy parents; they did not approve of her marriage to \\"the son of a plumber\\", so the young couple eloped in 1932. She was disowned by her parents for six months, and they refused to pay for her last year of college. The young couple struggled to survive during the depression, but ultimately had a long, happy, successful marriage. They had six healthy children. Laura, Andrew jr., Jane, Eric, Eileen, and Ingrid Early career Svenson began his career as a copy boy at the Newark Evening News, where he stayed until 1948. He worked his way up at the newspaper, becoming a writer. He was given his own column about pet care and health. During World War II he was promoted to the War Desk, and was the overnight editor for the Sunday Edition of the Newark Evening News. At the News, Svenson became a very close friend of writer Howard R. Garis, author of the Uncle Wiggily children‚Äôs book series. Stratemeyer Syndicate Garis introduced Svenson to Stratemeyer Syndicate partner Harriet Adams in 1947. Svenson began at the Syndicate as a ghostwriter in 1948. By his death in 1975, he had become a full partner in the Syndicate, and had shaped the course of multiple children‚Äôs book series during three challenging decades. Svenson began by writing Hardy Boys volumes #‚Äôs 28, 29, and 30, based on outlines by Harriet Adams. His first Hardy Boys book was ‚ÄúThe Sign of the Crooked Arrow,\\" published in 1949. He quickly advanced to work on other series, and on all aspects of production ‚Äî providing plot outlines, writing complete manuscripts, editing, and rewriting works produced by other Syndicate authors. By 1961, Svenson had become such a key component to the ongoing success of the Syndicate, that he was made a full partner. In addition to The Hardy Boys, Svenson also contributed to The Bobbsey Twins, Mel Martin Baseball Series, Honey Bunch, Honey Bunch and Norman, and Tom Swift Junior. He also created his own series, including The Happy Hollisters (a mystery series based on his own children), Brett King (a ‚Äúmodern cowboy‚Äù series), The Tollivers (created in 1967, about a middle class African American family who solve mysteries), and The Wynn and Lonny Racing Series (about adventurous brothers from North Carolina who race cars and solve mysteries.) =Hardy Boys= Svenson‚Äôs best known contribution to children‚Äôs literature is the Hardy Boys series. The series was originally started by Harriet Adams‚Äô father in 1927, and was written by several ghostwriters until 1948. The early books written in the 1920s and 1930s reflected the social era in which they were created; by today‚Äôs standards, they have many racial stereotypes. The books also portrayed police officers in a less than flattering light, and the brothers themselves were somewhat rebellious against authority. The Hardy Boys began to evolve in the late 1940s. Adams chose Svenson for this series based on his family life, and his contributions to the community; she wanted an author who could create more modern, wholesome Hardy Boys. Previously rebellious, the Hardy Boys would be adventurous yet respectful, resourceful and accomplished. This new image reflected the change in image Americans had of themselves in that era. The Hardy Boys evolved again, beginning in 1959. Many readers had complained about racial stereotypes in the older volumes, and under pressure from the publishing company, Harriet Adams agreed to a massive re-writing project to update the series. Svenson oversaw the project, eventually re-writing some of his own early books. The new books were shorter, free of negative racial stereotypes, and included more action and exotic locations. Svenson continued his mission to engage children with exciting stories, while simultaneously teaching them. He intentionally used vocabulary that was above the reading level of his target audience, in order to encourage them to look words up in the dictionary. He also traveled to the exotic locations he described in his books, in order to authentically portray cultures outside of the United States. He continued to write Hardy Boys books until his death in 1975. One of his last changes to the series was a change on the back cover of the books. On the advice of his granddaughter Jennifer, he changed the wording on the back cover of the Hardy Boys from ‚ÄúAll boys‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúAnyone.\\" Some critics have complained about the changes to the series; others have lauded his removal of sexist and racist language, and his willingness to keep the books updated and modern. =The Happy Hollisters= This series, developed and almost entirely written by Andrew Svenson, recounts the adventures of a young American middle- class family solving mysteries from their home on Pine Lake in Shoreham. This series is unique in that the characters are based on Svenson's family. In the series, \\"Pete\\" represented real son Andrew Jr., \\"Pam\\" represented daughter Laura, \\"Ricky\\" represented Eric, \\"Holly\\" represented Jane, and \\"Sue\\" was a composite of Svenson's two youngest daughters, Eileen and Ingrid. Even the dog and cat had real counterparts; \\"White Nose\\" was really the family cat Four Paws in the Snow, and collie \\"Zip\\" was real border collie Lassie. The \\"villain\\" Joey Brill, a neighborhood bully who tries to foil the Hollisters' mystery-solving efforts, was based on a real person as well, although everyone claims to have forgotten his real name. Jane (Svenson) Kossmann recounts that her father placed other real characters in this series, including her social studies teacher Mrs. Farber. She also relates that some of the stories in the books were based on stories from her Girl Scout Camp and her brother's Boy Scout Camp escapades. Svenson had his children, and later his grandchildren, review and \\"edit\\" his books. Jane remembers getting to the end of a chapter in an early rough draft of one book, when realized she could not read on, since the book was unfinished. After begging her father to tell her how the book ended, she was irritated by his response - that he didn't know how it ended yet, since he hadn't written it yet! Jane also recalls that while her friends at school knew that The Happy Hollisters were based on her family, no one thought it was \\"any kind of a big deal. It was just another job to them ‚Äî although they thought it was strange that my father worked from home sometimes, and sometimes all night and weekend.\\" She reports that he tended to write in concentrated sessions, sometimes for what seemed like three days straight. When he \\"locked himself in his office to write,\\" no one was allowed to disturb him. She reports that he took breaks from writing to swim at the local YMCA, ride his racing bicycle, or punch a boxer's punching bag he had set up at home. Death Svenson died of prostate cancer at Saint Barnabas Medical Center (Livingston, New Jersey) in 1975. He was 65 years old.

History  The product was created by Tom Jago of International Distillers & Vintners, and originally made from fruit spirits, flavored with rum and coconut flavoring in Cura√ßao. Originally, the product was used to simplify the making of pi√±a coladas by bartenders. When the product took off, the production was then moved to Barbados, where the rum is made by West Indies Rum Distillery Ltd., and the quality of the ingredients used was improved.

The deal meant that Pernod Ricard acquired a number of alcoholic beverage brands including Malibu rum.  Marketing  Past advertising campaigns labeled it \\"seriously easy going\\" and usually features people from the Caribbean taking life seriously, in a parody of the stress associated with the Western urban lifestyle, with a voice over at the end saying \\"If people in the Caribbean took life as seriously as this, they would never have invented Malibu. It's seriously easy going.\\" This Caribbean focus of Malibu's advertising stands in some contrast to the fact that the town after which it is named is in California rather than the Caribbean region. Since 2014, the advertising campaign has shifted toward the idea of Malibu encouraging people to have their \\"best summer ever\\" with a YouTube campaign and TV ads showing the difference between \\"summer you vs rest of the year you\\". In 2016 Malibu started an internet campaign with a commerce website and via the hashtag #Malibu.Pernod Ricard launches first brand-led ecommerce site as it looks to establish its own voice online, Marketing Week, 3 June 2016How Jersey Shore‚Äôs Vinny Is Leading the #Malibro Movement, Fortune, 7 April 2016  Variations  The original version of Malibu rum is flavored with coconut. There are many different versions of Malibu rum in the worldwide market, flavored with various tropical fruits such as banana, pineapple, passion fruit, island melon and mango. Additionally, there is a blend with mint, known as Malibu Fresh, tequila known as Malibu Red and a double strength version known as Malibu Black, which is a 35% rum-based liqueur that combines dark rum and the original coconut-flavored liqueur.

Plot Thomas Kresk is a loser‚Äîhe isn't good at his job, he's been tossed out of his home, and his wife just dumped him for the marriage counselor. On top of all that, his longtime friend and mentor Gordon Freeman died tragically. Now he's depressed, and contemplating suicide. And yes, things get worse: a criminal named Avnet (Jeff Goldblum) has stolen three priceless coins, and decided to blackmail Bollingsworth (Tom Wilkinson), his billionaire partner in crime. After Kresk overhears this, he almost gets shot‚Äîand Avnet ends up impaled on a pair of barbers' scissors. Now Kresk is in a considerably nastier situation, so he steals the gun and the coins. But things take a sharp turn when he hires a hit man named Mikey (Elijah Wood), and discovers that the hit man is only seventeen and emotionally traumatized by his parents' suicide. And that Kresk is falling for the cop/Playboy model Sgt. Meredith Kolko (Salma Hayek), and that his nephew Scottie (Devin Drewitz) has now swallowed the coins. Now Kresk is in over his head, and has to deal with the strange and sometimes dangerous people around him. Cast Production The primary filming location was Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Release Chain of Fools was released in theatres on September 22, 2000.

It is themed as a rafting expedition along the Chakranadi River, courtesy of \\"Kali Rapids Expeditions\\". In keeping with Disney's Animal Kingdom's message of conservation and environmental protection, this attraction deals with illegal logging and habitat destruction. Ride experience =Queue= The queue winds through temples and shops, passing by ancient, decaying statues, shrines, overgrown ruins, and lush landscapes, ending in the rafting offices for \\"Kali Rapids Expeditions.\\" In keeping with the theme against illegal logging, chainsaws can be heard in the forest near the queue. Inside the rafting offices, visitors pass a television screen on which the proprietor of ‚ÄúKali Rapids Expeditions‚Äù explains their company's mission: to show visitors the natural beauty of the area and demonstrate that there are non-destructive ways to bring revenue to their village. Just before reaching the loading area, a radio transmission warns that illegal loggers have moved dangerously close to the river. =Main ride= Kali River Rapids raft Moving into the brightly colored wooden pagoda, decorated with Tibetan prayer flags, riders are loaded from a rotating platform into 12-person rafts. The rafts have names such as ‚ÄúKathmandoozy‚Äù, ‚ÄúHimalayan Hummer‚Äù, ‚ÄúManaslu Slammer‚Äù, ‚ÄúBhaktapur Bubbler‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSherpa Surfer‚Äù. As the rafts leave the dock, riders begin their adventure on the Chakranadi River, first ascending a 90-foot lift hill through jasmine and ginger scented mist. Once at the top, the raft floats through the path of gushing geysers, past a waterfall and rock formation that forms the face of a tiger, and on through a dense tropical jungle where countless animal and bird calls can be heard. The water becomes choppier, and riders hear the sound of chainsaws and the smell of smoke. Around the bend, the lush vegetation gives way to charred tree stumps, and a fully loaded logging truck, which has slid perilously into the river, tries in vain to drive itself out. Moving further into a gargantuan pile of charred tree trunks, the raft passes through a flaming bridge of felled wood and then plummets down a 30-foot slide, soaking everyone in the resulting waves. Careening down the rapids, the raft passes waterfalls cascading down a granite rock face, before spinning and bumping its way along the whitewater. (the fire effects on the wood only turn on in the evening) Passing through a cave, riders are dampened further by dripping water, and by statues of water-carriers which spray water jets. Finally, the raft passes beneath a wooden bridge and past statues of elephants which also shoot water; these jets are controlled by park guests standing on the bridge. At this point the raft returns to the loading pagoda and riders disembark. The warning sign at the entrance of the Kali River Rapids warns guests that the ride is very wet. Incidents The ride was briefly closed on May 29, 2007 after five visitors and one employee received minor injuries as a result of an evacuation platform malfunction.

It is located at the southeast end of the Cathedral Range, northwest of Rodgers Peak. The peak as well as nearby Lyell Canyon is named after Charles Lyell, a well-known 19th century geologist. The peak had one of the last remaining glaciers in Yosemite, Lyell Glacier. The Lyell Glacier is currently considered to be a permanent ice field, not a living glacier. Mount Lyell divides the Tuolumne River watershed to the north, the Merced to the west, and the Rush Creek drainage in the Mono Lake Basin to the southeast. Climbing The most common approach to Mount Lyell is from Tuolumne Meadows on a highly traveled section of the John Muir Trail. The round trip is approximately and involves of elevation gain when starting from the Tuolumne Wilderness Office. The hike is easy from Tuolumne Meadows, following the Tuolumne River to the head of the Lyell Canyon, and becomes moderate as it approaches Donohue Pass. Before reaching Donahue Pass, the route leaves the trail and heads south towards Mount Lyell. Most summit ascents are done either over or around the Lyell Glacier. Seasonal and year-to-year variations on the glacier make it necessary to assess current conditions before choosing a route to the summit. The northwest Ridge, from the saddle between Mount Lyell and nearby Mount Maclure, offers climbing with high snow levels on the glacier. Low snow levels increases the grade to class 3 to 4 on the exposed granite ledges, in which cases it may be easier to ascend the glacier more directly to the summit. The summit block of Mount Lyell is composed of dark volcanic granite, similar to its neighbors to the southeast, Rodgers Peak, Mount Davis, Banner Peak, and Mount Ritter. This rock is very loose and unstable for climbing, making the ascent to the summit plateau dangerous when the glacier is low, exposing the lower reaches of the summit block. For this reason, some climbers consider Mount Lyell and nearby Mount Maclure to actually be geologically part of the Ritter Range. The grade of the East Arete likewise increases with low snow conditions, going from class 3 to class 4 (the looseness of the rock underlying the glacier on the East Arete makes it somewhat dangerous in low snow conditions). Other routes exist on the south and west sides, but of greater difficulty and longer approaches.

The texts describe him as a member of the 'Spiritual Hierarchy', or 'Brotherhood', of Mahatmas, one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, defined as the spiritual guides of mankind and teachers of ancient cosmological, metaphysical, and esoteric principles that form the origin of all the world's great philosophies, mythologies and spiritual traditions. According to Theosophical writings, Djwal Khul is said to work on furthering the spiritual evolution of our planet through the teachings offered in the 24 books by Alice Bailey of Esoteric Teachings published by The Lucis Trust (then named the Lucifer Publishing Company); he is said to have telepathically transmitted the teachings to Bailey and is thus regarded by her followers as the communications director of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. In Theosophy and the writings of Alice Bailey Djwal Khul's name first appeared in the work of Madame Blavatsky, a co-founder of the Theosophical Society and author of \\"The Secret Doctrine\\", published in 1888, which was primarily written by Koot Hoomi and Morya, according to Blavatsky and others in the Mahatma letters.The Writing of The Secret Doctrine - By Kirby Van Mater - www.theosociety.org/pasadena/invit-sd/invsd-4.htmLetters from the Masters of the Wisdom, No. 19, 1:47, 5th ed. Bailey writes in August 1934, in the first person voice of DK: [I am] \\"a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and this tells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to and beyond The Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men on the borders of Tibet and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over a large group of Tibetan Lamas, when my other duties permit.\\" In some writings, his name was omitted and he was referred to by the abbreviation \\"Master D.

The Unfinished Autobiography. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 162-163 (later associated with the initials D.K.).

The Externalisation of the Hierarchy, Lucis Trust., p. 685 Bailey stated that after initial resistance, she was eventually persuaded by the quality of what she had written in 'dictation' in the first few weeks work with DK to continue to write down the communications from this source. She wrote for 30 years, from 1919 to 1949.Bailey, Alice A. The Unfinished Autobiography. Lucis Trust. 1951. From the Preface by Foster Bailey, p 1 Bailey wrote that Djwal Khul's intention was the revelation of esoteric teachings that were valuable for the continued training and teaching of spiritual aspirants in the 20th and early 21st century. She believed her work was done on behalf of the \\"spiritual hierarchy\\" of advanced beings, that included Djwal Khul, whose sole interest was to guide humanity towards the establishing of goodwill and right human relations, the vital first steps that would help prepare the way for the \\"Reappearance of the Christ\\" (called by Theosophists The Maitreya). Alice Bailey's 24 books with DK were to be the second in a series of three revelations, after Blavatsky's \\"The Secret Doctrine\\", that were meant present the preparatory teachings that would serve to usher in the New Age referred to as the Age of Aquarius, because the astrological sign of Aquarius will soon succeed this present Piscean cycle in the cycle of the astrological ages. In a preface included in many of Bailey's books, Djwal Khul, in the dictations described by Bailey, refers to the fact that he has been reported to be an abbot of a Tibetan monastery and the spiritual preceptor of a large group of lamas. She wrote that he lived in Northern India, near the borders of Tibet. Other than that the books do not include personal details about Djwal Khul and the dictated content focuses on his esoteric teachings. Of the minimal personal details, Bailey writes that Djwhal Khul considers himself a disciple of a certain degree in the spiritual, non-physical, ashram of the Master Koot Hoomi, who is considered by Theosophists and other students of Alice Bailey's books to be another member of the same \\"spiritual hierarchy\\" of advanced beings. C. W. Leadbeater claimed that he saw Djwal Khul teleport into a room in which he and Madame Blavatsky were sitting.Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 Theosophical Publishing House Pages 8-9 In other New Age movements Bailey's work and her books with Djwal Khul were published by the Lucis Trust, an organization she set up with her husband, Foster Bailey. Over time, Djwal Khul's name has appeared in the writings about Ascended Masters (a phrase not used or sanctioned by either The Tibetan or Mrs. Bailey) of various New Age organizations (of debatable credibility according to some) such as the Ascended Master Teachings of Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who claims that she has channeled Djwal Khul as well as the other Mahatmas, such as Koot Hoomi and the Master El Morya, among many others, resulting in dozens of volumes of transcriptions. The leaders of these groups described themselves as having direct contact with him and other \\"Masters of Wisdom\\", and to be working as their disciples on the physical plane. Within the Arcane School founded by Bailey, DK's works are studied along with other spiritual teachings of all ages. He is treated as a teacher and neither he nor his books have become objects of devotion. Previous incarnation According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, one of Djwal Khul's previous incarnations was as Caspar, one of the Three Wise Men (the one who gave gold to Jesus).Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Lords of the Seven Rays Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Page 33 Function in the spiritual hierarchy It is believed by the followers of Benjamin Creme and the followers of the Alice Bailey teachings, that Djwal Khul coordinates the activities of the seven masters of the Seven Rays to advance the Plan of the Masters and functions as the communications director of the Ascended Masters since he is believed to have telepathically transmitted the teachings in the Alice A. Bailey material to Alice Bailey. Criticism The teachings of Djwal Khul, as conveyed through Bailey's many books in his name, contain and deal with many controversial topics, stating that there are widespread evils ingrained in popular ideas and statements about nationalism, race relations, American isolationism, Soviet totalitarianism, fascism, Nazism, and Zionism. The books include content critical of the then current 19th century and early 20th century ideas and views about people of African descent, Aboriginal Australians, the Jewish people and Arabs, and of Judaism and orthodox Christianity and fundamentalist movements of both East and West.

Paul Johnson maintains that the \\"Masters\\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.

History After the 1990 general election, which was unrecognised and suppressed by the newly formed military junta, many students that participated in the 8888 uprising fled the country and went to neighbouring Thailand. In August 1999, the VBSW was formed as an armed opposition group, which differentiated from groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic Front, which originally sought democracy through peaceful demonstrations. On 1 October 1999, a group of five members raided the Burmese consulate in Bangkok and took 89 people hostage. The group demanded that negotiations be opened between the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military junta, and that a new Hluttaw (national parliament) be convened based on the results of the 1990 election. However, the group soon relaxed their demands and began to release hostages, and the Thai government eventually escorted the VBSW members by helicopter to the Thai-Myanmar border. Despite openly supporting the democracy movement in Myanmar, lead figures of the movement such as Aung San Suu Kyi, the President of the NLD, have denounced the VBSW, and their use of violence to achieve their goals.fas.org - IRP World Notes References Category:History of Myanmar (1948‚Äìpresent) Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Myanmar Category:Politics of Myanmar Category:Rebel groups in Myanmar Category:Student organizations established in 1999 Category:Student organisations in Myanmar Category:1999 establishments in Myanmar ","title":"Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors"},{"id":"2177216","text":"Buddy Christ Buddy Christ is a parody religious icon and Catholic Church marketing tool created by Filmmaker Kevin Smith, which first appeared in Smith‚Äôs 1999 film Dogma.

It is widely referred to in this way by the industry. Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003. Patch Tuesday occurs on the second, and sometimes fourth, Tuesday of each month in North America. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 18:00 or 17:00 UTC (10:00 PST (UTC‚àí8) or 10:00 PDT (UTC‚àí7)). The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles and the Technet bulletin are unlocked later. Microsoft has a pattern of releasing a larger number of updates in even- numbered months, and fewer in odd-numbered months. Minor updates are also released outside Patch Tuesday. Daily updates consist of malware database refreshes for Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials. Sometimes there is an extraordinary Patch Tuesday, two weeks after the regular Patch Tuesday. Some updates could be released at any time.  History  Starting with Windows 98, Microsoft included Windows Update that once installed and executed, would check for patches to Windows and its components, which Microsoft would release intermittently. With the release of Microsoft Update, this system also checks for updates for other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, Visual Studio and SQL Server. Earlier versions of Windows Update suffered from two problems: # Less-experienced users often remained unaware of Windows Update and did not install it. Microsoft countered this issue in Windows ME with the Automatic Updates component, which displayed availability of updates, with the option of automatic installation. # Customers with multiple copies of Windows, such as corporate users, not only had to update every Windows deployment in the company but also to uninstall patches issued by Microsoft that broke existing functionality. Microsoft introduced \\"Patch Tuesday\\" in October 2003 to reduce the cost of distributing patches. This system accumulates security patches over a month, and dispatches them all on the second Tuesday of each month, an event for which system administrators may prepare. The following day, informally known as \\"Exploit Wednesday\\", marks the time when exploits may appear in the wild which take advantage on unpatched machines of the newly announced vulnerabilities. Tuesday was chosen as the optimal day of the week to distribute software patches. This is done to maximize the amount of time available before the upcoming weekend to correct any issues that might arise with those patches, while leaving Monday free to address other unanticipated issues that might have arisen over the preceding weekend.  Security implications  An obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case. There have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently. At the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.  Exploit Wednesday  Many exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch; analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems. Therefore, the term \\"Exploit Wednesday\\" was coined. = Discontinued Windows versions = Microsoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities present in both newer and older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (c.f. \\"zero-day attacks\\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known such vulnerabilities became, leaving these vulnerabilities unfixed and devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions). For Windows Vista \\"extended support\\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before. For Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020, and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1; this will cause the same \\"unfixed vulnerabilities\\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020). = Windows 10 = One major change with the introduction of Windows 10 was that Microsoft started to release a new version of Windows 10 twice per year, and with Microsoft's \\"modern lifecycle policy\\" a newly released Windows 10 version starts a \\"grace period\\" for the previous version with regard to support unlike previous Windows products which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and support was governed by the \\"fixed lifecycle policy\\". With this new policy Home and Pro versions of Windows 10 will be provided with security and feature updates (so called \\"mainstream support\\") for up to 18 months after release, \\"enterprise\\" and education versions for 24 months. To give an example: support for Windows 10 Home/Pro version 1703 (which was released in April 2017) will be stopped by Microsoft in October 2018, and support for versions 1507 and 1511 (released in 2015) officially ended in 2017. Microsoft announced that it would give \\"extended support\\" (security but not feature updates) for at least one \\"semi-annual channel\\" (SAC) Windows 10 version until October 14, 2025. According to Microsoft a \\"device needs to install the latest version (feature update) before [the] current version reaches end of service to help keep your device secure and have it remain supported by Microsoft\\". As with previous Windows operating systems, any device running such an unsupported version of Windows (which no longer receives security patches) is potentially affected by the \\"unfixed vulnerabilities\\" issue beginning with the \\"end of support\\" date. To counter this Microsoft has designed the update system for the Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 so that in most cases if technically possible the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically this has however drawn criticism due to other problems such forced upgrades can introduce. In addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized \\"Long-Term Servicing Branch\\" (LTSB) or \\"Long-Term Servicing Channel\\" (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's \\"fixed lifecycle policy\\", e.g. \\"Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB\\" will receive extended support until October 13, 2026.  Adoption by other companies  SAP's \\"Security Patch Day\\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays. Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday. One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.  Bandwidth impact  Windows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth. However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) according to Microsoft \\"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\\"MSDN BITS Network Bandwidth Furthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow-start congestion control strategy. As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally. In addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \\"share\\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.

Originally named George Michael's Sports Final when it began as a local show in Washington, D.C., in 1980, it was nationally syndicated by NBC from 1984 until its final installment was aired on March 25, 2007. Michael won a Sports Emmy in 1985 for his work on The George Michael Sports Machine. Early life and career Michael was born George Michael Gimpel in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 24, 1939, the son of Margaret and Earl Herman Gimpel. He grew up near Tower Grove Park in the city's south side, and graduated from St. Louis University High School. While attending Saint Louis University, he worked as a Midwest promoter for several record labels such as Scepter and Motown. It was also during this time when he made his radio broadcasting debut on a one-hour Sunday night show at midnight on WIL, which invited individual SLU students to be the hosts every week. He earned a full-time job as a disc jockey at the station after he was judged to be the best of the group. His first radio appointment outside of his hometown was in 1962 at WRIT in Milwaukee, where he worked the 6-to-10 pm shift until he was reassigned to 5-to-9 morning drive time in early 1964. His next stop was at KBTR in Denver later in 1964, working under the name \\"King\\" George Michael for the first time. He earned the nickname due to his success in \\"ruling\\" evening radio. He became one of the original Boss Jocks at WFIL in Philadelphia when its new Top 40 rock and roll format debuted on September 18, 1966. He served as music director and evening deejay for the next eight years. WFIL, which was popularly known as \\"Famous 56\\" after the transition, ended WIBG's listener ratings dominance and became the city's most popular station by the summer of 1967. Michael was the first Philadelphia rock and roll radio personality to read the scores of local high school football and basketball games on the air. He also helped to start the career of Howard Eskin by hiring him to be his engineer. Decades later, Eskin would be a contributor to The George Michael Sports Machine. On George's last WFIL show (on September 6, 1974) he played \\"When Will I See You Again\\" by the Three Degrees for the first time ever on any radio station. The playing of this on his show broke the song into the mainstream, and within two months was a huge international hit, reaching number one in the U.K., and number two in the United States. George was personal friends with the owners of Philadelphia International Records and the song's writers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The aircheck of this can be heard on WFIL's tribute site www.famous56.com, where he says, \\"I don't know if this song will be a hit\\". Michael, noted for his energetic style, was hired by WABC in New York City; his first on-air stint there was on the evening of September 9, 1974. Michael now not only was entering the nation's largest media market; he also succeeded radio legend \\"Cousin Brucie\\" Morrow, who had jumped to competitor WNBC. Several incidents from Michael's radio stint there have been chronicled in Morrow's autobiography. Even though he was reunited with Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy (colleagues from his WIL days in St. Louis), Michael's time at WABC, which ended on November 17, 1979, was mostly frustrating because he was no longer a music director who had any influence on a playlist which was much shorter than the ones with which he was more familiar. One of the highlights during his time at the station occurred when he anchored its coverage of the New York City blackout of 1977 after the music format was temporarily suspended for the night. His first experience in sports broadcasting also came in 1974 when he was a television announcer for the Baltimore Orioles on WJZ-TV. He declined an offer to work for the ballclub full-time in order to accept the WABC position. As part of the deal to bring him to New York, Michael also worked for WABC-TV as the weekend sports anchor and a color commentator on New York Islanders telecasts for several seasons, paired mainly with Tim Ryan. He served as an occasional substitute on ABC American Contemporary Network's Speaking of Sports show whenever Howard Cosell, the primary commentator, was on vacation or assignment. Television career As the primary sports anchor at WRC-TV in Washington from 1980 to 2007, Michael was easily one of the most popular media personalities in the Washington area. Michael got significant latitude in his programming, employing a bevy of segments some viewers might consider old- fashioned, including his \\"Tuesday Replays\\" and \\"Wednesday Wrestling\\". He also had devoted extensive coverage to and was considered a significant influence in the popularity of NASCAR, broadcasting interviews with famous drivers such as Dale Earnhardt well before that sport became what it is today. An avid equestrian, Michael also broadcast segments on bull riding and rodeo. He was the play-by-play announcer for most of the Professional Bull Riders's Built Ford Tough Series NBC telecasts during the 2003 and 2004 seasons, including the final day of the PBR World Finals each year. Michael also covered the career of bull rider Lane Frost, who was killed at Cheyenne Frontier Days in 1989 by the bull he rode. Michael covered the matchups between Frost and the undefeated bull Red Rock called the Challenge of the Champions. Michael was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame in 2006 for his efforts. Michael's affable personality enabled him to land rare interviews with many aloof local and national sports personalities. For example, Michael's team at WRC-TV had been the only local sportscasters allowed to broadcast from inside the Washington Redskins' FedExField during the season. Two movies, 8 Seconds and The Rookie, were inspired by stories featured on The Sports Machine. Michael made a cameo appearance in the former, as well as in The Silence of the Lambs and Tin Cup. The Sports Machine was also featured in There's Something About Mary. In November 2005, Michael was seriously injured in a horseback riding accident. He broke several ribs and injured his wrists during the mishap at his Comus farm in upper Montgomery County, Maryland. Michael resumed his duties in December 2005. =Later career= Michael left his role as WRC-TV's daily sports anchor on March 1, 2007, following a dispute with WRC-TV over layoffs of his staff imposed company-wide by NBCUniversal. The George Michael Sports Machine went off the air on March 25, 2007. He continued to host weekend sports panel shows such as Full Court Press (basketball season) and Redskins Report (football season) as well as interviews at Redskins Park on Mondays with Jim Zorn and Joe Bugel through December 2008. He was completely dropped from WRC-TV owing to budget cuts despite the fact Redskins Report was consistently one of WRC's top sports shows. He indicated at the time of his layoff that he would like to work on a panel show again but not on a nightly newscast.Shapiro, Leonard. \\"Loss of Michael Is a Truly Deep Cut\\", The Washington Post, Monday, December 29, 2008. Personal life He and his wife, Pat, whom he married in 1978 and who produced the Sports Machine, had daughters Cindi and Michelle and son Brad. Michael died at age 70 at Sibley Memorial Hospital on December 24, 2009, after being diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia two years prior.

It is related to the fair-queuing principle which groups packets into classes and shares the service capacity between them. GPS shares this capacity according to some fixed weights. In process scheduling, GPS is \\"an idealized scheduling algorithm that achieves perfect fairness. All practical schedulers approximate GPS and use it as a reference to measure fairness.\\" Generalized processor sharing assumes that traffic is fluid (infinitesimal packet sizes), and can be arbitrarily split. There are several service disciplines which track the performance of GPS quite closely such as weighted fair queuing (WFQ), also known as packet-by-packet generalized processor sharing (PGPS).  Justification  In a network such as the internet, different application types require different levels of performance. For example, email is a genuinely store and forward kind of application, but videoconferencing isn't since it requires low latency. When packets are queued up on one end of a congested link, the node usually has some freedom in deciding the order in which it should send the queued packets. One example ordering is simply first-come, first-served, which works fine if the sizes of the queues are small, but can result in problems if there are latency sensitive packets being blocked by packets from bursty, higher bandwidth applications.  Details  In GPS, a scheduler handling N flows (also called \\"classes\\", or \\"sessions\\") is configured with one weight w_i for each flow. Then, the GPS ensures that, considering one flow i, and some time interval (s,t] such that the flow i is continuously backlogged on this interval (i.e. the queue is never empty), then, for any other flow j, the following relation holds :w_j O_i(s,t) \\\\geq w_i O_j(s,t) where O_k(s,t) denotes the amount of bits of the flow k made output on interval (s,t]. Then, it can be proved that each flow i will receive at least a rate :R_i = \\\\frac{w_i}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^N w_j} R where R is the rate of the server. This is a minimal rate. If some flow does not use its bandwidth during some period, this remaining capacity is shared by the active flows wrt their respective weights. For example, consider a GPS server with w_1=2,w_2=w_3=1. The first flow will receive at least half of the capacity, whereas the other two only get . Nevertheless, if on some time interval (s,t], only the second and third flows are active, they will receive each one half of the capacity.  Implementations, parametrization and fairness  In GPS, and all protocols inspired by GPS, the choice of the weights is left to the network administrator. Generalized processor sharing assumes that the traffic is fluid, i.e., infinitely divisible so that whenever an application type has packets in the queue, it will receive exactly the fraction of the server given by the formula above. However, traffic is not fluid and consists of packets, possibly of variable sizes. Therefore, GPS is mostly a theoretical idea, and several scheduling algorithms have been developed to approximate this GPS ideal: PGPS, aka Weighted fair queuing, is the most known implementation of GPS, but it has some drawbacks, and several other implementations have been proposed, as Deficit round robin or WF2Q. GPS is considered as a fair ideal, and all its approximations \\"use it as a reference to measure fairness.\\" Nevertheless, several Fairness measures exist. GPS is insensible to packet sizes, since it assumes a fluid model.

It is one of the few cities in Russia to be larger than the capital or the administrative center of its federal subject in terms of population, economic activity, and tourist traffic. Population: 373,940 (2019); History The name of the city, according to one tradition, originates from the Khanty words \\"sur\\" (fish) and \\"gut\\" (hole, pit). It was founded in 1594 by order of Tsar Feodor I Surgut at the end of the 16th century was a small fortress with two gates and five towers, one of which had a carriageway. In 1596 the Gostiny Dvor was built. In the 17th-18th centuries - one of the centers of the Russian development of Siberia. The fortification, built of strong wood, was located on the cape, so that it was impossible to approach it unnoticed either from the river or from the land. In the central square of the ancient settlement there was a cult place. Throughout the perimeter, the fortress was surrounded by a moat, which was blocked by the structures of the defensive system. Outside the village there were special buildings - handicraft workshops, in particular, a smithy. By the name list of 1625 there were 222 servicemen living here. Subsequently, due to high mortality, the population of Surgut gradually decreased. In 1627, 216 people lived, in 1635-200 people, in 1642-199. In the second half of the 17th century the population fluctuated around 200 people, by the end of the century there were 185 inhabitants in Surgut. Since 1782, the county town of the Surgut district of the Tobolsk province, province, has been formed. In 1785, the city's coat of arms was approved. At the end of the 18th century, in connection with the development of southern Siberian cities, lost its administrative significance. Since 1868 - district, and since 1898 - the county town of Tobolsk province. The inhabitants of Surgut, like other Siberians, were on state security. The servants received an annual salary of money (from 5 rubles 25 kopecks), bread (8 quarters of bachelor and 11 quarters of married Cossacks) and salt (one and a half poods married and a pood with a quarter bachelor). The inhabitants were supplied with weapons and ammunition. At the end of the 19th century (according to the census of 1897), the population of Surgut was 1.1 thousand people. The main occupation of the inhabitants was fishing, gathering of wild plants, trade, cattle breeding, firewood harvesting. In 1835 the Cossack school was founded, in 1877 - the men's folk school, the women's parochial school operated, the weather station (since 1878), the library-reading room, the people's house, since 1913 - the telegraph. Since November 3, 1923 the city became the center of the district of Tobolsk district of the Ural region. Since April 5, 1926, in connection with a small population (1,3 thousand people), Surgut was transformed into a district village. In 1928, on the basis of the fish section, the first industrial enterprise was created - the fish canning factory. In 1929 a collective farm was organized, in 1930 - a forest site, in 1931 - a timber enterprise. In the 1930s in Surgut, attempts were made to extract minerals. October 23, 1934 is the first newspaper - \\"Organizer\\" (\\"Surgut Tribune\\"). The urbanization of Surgut took place in the 1960s, when it became a center of oil and gas production. On June 25, 1965 the work settlement of Surgut was granted town status. The city's holiday is celebrated annually on June 12\\\\. The current mayor is Vadim Nikolaevich Shuvalov (since 2016). Ex-mayor Alexander Sidorov (since 1996) oversaw the construction of the Surgut Bridge, the longest one-tower cable-stayed bridge in the world.

As a municipal division, the city of okrug significance of Surgut is incorporated as Surgut Urban Okrug.Law #63-oz Economy The city is home to the largest port on the Ob River, the largest road/railway junction in northwest Siberia, and two of the world's most powerful power plants, the SDPP-1 (State District Power Plant 1) and SDPP-2 (State District Power Plant 2), which produce over 7,200 megawatts and supply most of the region with relatively cheap electricity. Surgut's economy is tied to oil production (the city is known as \\"The Oil Capital of Russia\\") and the processing of natural gas. The most important enterprises are the oil firm Surgutneftegaz and Surgutgazprom (a unit of Gazprom). The Surgut-2 Power Station providing Energy for the city is the largest gas-fired power station in the world. In Surgut, Tyumen Energy Retail Company, the largest energy sales company, is the guaranteeing supplier of electric power in the Tyumen region, ranked first in terms of the value of the productive supply of electricity among the energy distribution companies of the Urals Federal District and the second among the energy sales companies in Russia. The management office of OJSC TESS, the largest enterprise of the Urals Federal District, is located in the city in the sphere of complex service maintenance, overhaul and reconstruction of electric power facilities. In addition, there are factories: gas processing, stabilization of condensate, motor fuel. Enterprises food (meat processing, dairy, etc.) industry, timber industry. Manufacture of building materials (production of reinforced concrete structures, etc.). For 2013, the volume of shipped goods of own production, works performed and services by own strength for large and medium-sized producers of industrial products amounted to 100.7 billion rubles.

In June 2013, Empire announced it would exit the movie theatre business, selling the vast majority of locations to Cineplex (24 in Atlantic Canada) and Landmark Cinemas (23, in Ontario and western Canada, including two locations originally slated to be purchased by Cineplex and the Downtown Ottawa theatre).http://www.empireco.ca/en/investor-centre/news-release/empire- company-announces-sale-of-empire-theatres/ Five other locations in operation at the time of the announcement were not included in either deal and were closed, Two of these locations re-opened again at a later date under different ownershttp://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/rainbow-elgin-mills-cinema-opens- november-20-513231881.htmlhttp://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/capitol-6-reopens- starring-luxury- recliners-1.2449620http://www.timescolonist.com/business/victoria-s-renovated- capitol-6-reopens-nov-4-as-luxury-multiplex-1.2368448 and two other locations remain closed along with one Drive-in.  History  = Formation = Empire Theatres was formed from the Sobey family's purchase of the Atlantic Canadian assets of Canadian Odeon Theatres in 1984 as part of that chain's merger into Cineplex Odeon Corporation (now Cineplex Entertainment). Later, it also acquired selected Famous Players theatres locations, including those in Newfoundland and Labrador. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Famous Players remained a major competitor in the Maritimes. Empire responded by opening several new or replacement locations along the lines of the multiplexes being opened by Cineplex and Famous Players in the rest of Canada. Despite an aggressive expansion in the Maritimes in the mid-1990s, Famous Players had focused on improvements elsewhere and did not match Empire's moves, one of which included an 18-screen (including one IMAX screen) multiplex in the Bayers Lake Business Park in suburban Halifax. With comparably minor interests in the region, Famous Players cut back on marketing and then sold its remaining screens in Atlantic Canada to Empire Theatres in 2004. = Expansion to Western Canada = On August 22, 2005, Empire announced it would acquire 27 theatres, with a total of 202 screens, in locations from British Columbia to Ontario, from Cineplex Galaxy LP, as a result of the latter's acquisition of Famous Players Theatres, effectively doubling Empire's size. Most of the locations were \\"traditional\\" venues, but some were larger theatres, such as Coliseum Calgary, SilverCity theatres in Kitchener and St. Catharines, Ontario, one in Calgary, Alberta, and Cineplex Odeon Square One in Mississauga.http://mediafiles.cineplex.com/_att/0cee5299-d78a-434e-8ed8-61179e4df807/2005-08-22--%20Cineplex%20Galaxy%20Announces%20Sale%20of%20Theatres%20to%20Empire%20Theatres%20Limited--.pdf The deal closed September 30, 2005. In December 2009, the Empire Theatres chain had 48 screens equipped with digital projection and RealD 3D capabilities. In March 2012, Empire announced that it was the \\"first national exhibitor in Canada to complete circuit wide digital cinema conversion\\", with 359 screens converted, 40 percent of which had RealD 3D capability. On June 21, 2012, Empire announced the acquisition of two Ontario-based theatres from AMC Theatres, located in Ottawa, Ontario and Whitby, Ontario. Each theatre featured 24 screens, including an IMAX experience auditorium. Empire had also announced plans to equip all screens in these locations with Barco digital technology, and some with RealD 3D technology, to \\"provide movie-goers with a state-of-the-art movie presentation experience\\".http://www.newswire.ca/news- releases/empire-theatres-announces-acquisition-of-two-ontario-amc- theatres-510412281.html = Sale to Cineplex and Landmark = The Lansdowne location that Empire Theatres announced in 2011 was acquired by Cineplex in 2014 and opened in 2015. On June 27, 2013, Empire Company Ltd. announced that it would be focusing on its retail and real estate operations (including Sobeys, which earlier in the month had agreed to purchase Safeway's Canadian operations).

The story is set in the same area as King's novel Dreamcatcher. It is also set in the universe of It. Setting \\"Gray Matter\\" takes place in Bangor, Maine during a snow storm. The characters move from inside a convenience store to an apartment building. Plot summary The story, told from the perspective of an older \\"local\\" man, begins as he is sitting around at a convenience store with a group of his friends during a heavy snowstorm. A young boy runs in, deathly afraid. The men recognize him as the son of Richie Grenadine, a local man who was injured some time ago in a work accident, and was given lifetime workers' compensation. With no need to support himself, Richie became a recluse, rarely seen outside the confines of his apartment except to purchase the cheapest of beer, although lately, he had been sending his son out to purchase his beer for him. After speaking privately with Richie's son, a group of men including the narrator and store owner Henry decide to take the beer to Richie personally. On their way, Henry relates some of the terrifying experiences the kid had told him ‚Äî of how one day his father drank a \\"bad\\" can of beer, implied to carry a mutagen, and since then has been slowly transforming into an inhuman blob-like abomination that detests light and craves warm beer. Spying on him one night, the boy saw his father eat a dead cat, causing him to finally seek help. Arriving at Richie's home, the men confront Richie from behind his closed door, demanding that he come out. The odor pouring out from behind the door convinces the group that Richie was eating more than dead cats, speculating that he may be responsible for a recent rash of missing people. The men are horrified when Richie opens the door and shambles out, resembling more fungus than man. The rest of the men run off as Henry stands his ground, firing his pistol at the creature. The story ends with the narrator recalling how his brief glimpse of the creature made him realize it was in the process of dividing in two, and calculating the exponential growth the creature is capable of, as they sit at the convenience store, waiting to find out whether Henry or the creature survived.  Adaptations  The first episode of the 2019 Shudder anthology web series Creepshow is based on the Gray Matter story.

The Algerian hedgehog (Atelerix algirus) is a separate species of hedgehog. The domesticated hedgehog kept as a pet is typically the African pygmy hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris).http://hedgehogsofasgard.com/post/132357438526/the-african-pygmy- hedgehog-hybrid-or-not Other species kept as pets include the Egyptian long- eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus auritus) and the Indian long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus collaris). Roman domesticated hedgehog The Romans domesticated a relative of the Algerian hedgehog in the 4th century BC to use for meat and quills as well as pets. The Romans also used hedgehog skins to clean their shawls, making them important to commerce and causing the Roman senate to regulate the trading of hedgehog skins. The quills were used in the training of other animals, such as keeping a calf from suckling after it had been weaned. Hedgehog quills were used for card paper and dissection pins long after the Romans actively bred and raised hedgehogs. Modern domestication A pet hedgehog Hedgehog domestication became popular in the early 1980s although some U.S. some states ban them or require a license to own one. Since domestication began, several new colors of hedgehogs have been created or become common, including albino and pinto hedgehogs. Pinto is a color pattern, rather than a color: a total lack of color on the quills and skin beneath in distinct patches. Domesticated species prefer a warm climate (above 22 ¬∞C, 72 ¬∞F) and do not naturally hibernate. Attempts to hibernate due to lowered body temperatures can be fatal, but are easily reversed if caught within a few days. African Pygmy Hedgehogs have 16 whiskers. Legality Because a hedgehog is commonly kept in a cage or similar enclosure, it is allowed in some residences where cats and dogs are not allowed. It is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet in some jurisdictions in North America, and a license is needed to legally breed them. These restrictions may have been enacted due to the ability of some hedgehog species to carry foot and mouth disease, a highly contagious disease of cloven-hooved animals. No such restrictions exist in most European countries (although Italy is an exception). The European hedgehog is a protected species in all countries that have signed the Berne Convention; this includes all member states of the Council of Europe, as well as the European Union and a small number of other states. In these countries, the European hedgehog may not be captured or kept as a pet. =Legal status internationally= *Austria: European hedgehogs are protected and cannot be kept as pets.

Enclosures A domesticated baby hedgehog In the wild, a hedgehog will cover many miles each night. A hedgehog with insufficient range may show signs of depression, such as excessive sleeping, refusal to eat, repetitious behaviour, and self-mutilation. Hedgehogs require a fair amount of exercise to avoid liver problems due to excess weight. Therefore, a domesticated hedgehog must have access to a running wheel. Running wheels must be selected carefully to avoid foot injury. Food In the wild, a hedgehog is opportunistic and will eat many things, but the majority of the diet comprises insects. As insectivores, hedgehogs need a diet that is high in protein and low in fat. They also require chitin, which comes from the exoskeleton of insects; fiber in the diet may be a substitute for the chitin component. There are prepared foods specifically for pet hedgehogs and insectivores, including foods made from insect components. Also available are alimentary powders to sprinkle on other food which provide chitin and other nutrients. Pet hedgehogs may eat such table foods as cooked, lean chicken, turkey, beef or pork. They will often eat small amounts of vegetables and fruit. Hedgehogs are lactose-intolerant and will have stomach problems after consuming most dairy products, though occasional plain low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese seem to be well tolerated. Hedgehogs can easily become obese; if they can no longer roll completely into a ball it is a clear sign of obesity. Conversely, hedgehogs often stop eating under situations of stress such as when adjusting to a new home. Allergies Hedgehogs produce very little danger to their owners and handlers.Reasons to own a Hedgehog at. Hedgies.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-09. It is possible to be allergic to items surrounding the hedgehog, such as the hedgehog's food or bedding, but it is rare that a person would be allergic to the hedgehog itself. After handling hedgehogs, some have claimed that pink dots on their hands is an allergic reaction. This is more likely caused by small pricks from the hedgehog's spines. If a hedgehog is not clean, the pricks can become infected. The infection is from contaminants on the hedgehog or on the surface of the hands, not from an allergic reaction to the hedgehog. As is true with most animal handling, one should wash their hands after handling a hedgehog. Hedgehogs are commonly allergic to wood oils. Wood bedding should be avoided, specifically cedar. The oil found in cedar can cause severe upper respiratory problems. Aspen however is widely accepted as a safe substitute. Diseases Hedgehogs are prone to many diseases, including cancer, which spreads quickly in hedgehogs, and wobbly hedgehog syndrome (WHS), a neurological syndrome. Some symptoms of WHS resemble those of multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans, therefore the condition the animal experiences can be compared with what MS patients experience. A possible cause of WHS is a genetic flaw allowing a virus to attack the hedgehog's nervous system. The nose can display a variety of symptoms of a troubled hedgehog, especially respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. In many cases, the form of pneumonia that affects hedgehogs is bacterial in nature. If acted upon quickly, antibiotics can have a very positive effect. Signs to watch for include bubbles, excessive dripping, or constant sneezing. Hedgehogs usually react to stress with temporary digestive disorders that include vomiting and green feces.Health information at. Hedgies.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-09.

Massacre It was in his capacity as a company commander that he gained notoriety, being responsible for the 27 May 1940 massacre of British prisoners-of-war at Le Paradis in the Pas-de-Calais. Ninety-nine members of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment who had surrendered to his unit in a cattle shed were stood in front of the barn wall, and Kn√∂chlein ordered two machine-guns turned on them, followed by bayoneting and shooting any apparent survivors. Two of the prisoners, privates Albert Pooley and William O'Callaghan, managed to escape the massacre, but the remaining 97 were hastily buried along the barn wall. According to the historians Murray and Millet: \\"The company commander, Obersturmf√ºhrer Fritz Knochlein, lined the prisoners up against a barn wall and machinegunned the lot. Any survivors were bayoneted and shot. German military authorities brought no charges against Knochlein.\\" In 1942, the bodies were exhumed by the French authorities and reburied in a local cemetery which eventually became the Le Paradis War Cemetery.\\"Le Paradis War Cemetery, Lestrem.\\" Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved 7 November 2015 During this time, Albert Pooley made it a personal mission to hunt down Kn√∂chlein and bring him up on charges of war crimes after the war. Trial and execution In August 1948, Kn√∂chlein was formally arraigned on charges of war crimes, to which he pleaded not guilty. :The accused Fritz Kn√∂chlein, a German national, in the charge of the Hamburg Garrison Unit, pursuant to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals, is charged with committing a war crime in that he in the vicinity of Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the killing of about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units. His trial began on Monday 11 October 1948 in Rotherbaum, and both Albert Pooley and William O'Callaghan were called to testify against him. Kn√∂chlein's defence attorney claimed that Kn√∂chlein had not been present on the day of the battle, and that the British forces had used illegal dumdum bullets during the battle. Upon being found guilty, Kn√∂chlein applied for clemency, arguing that he had a wife and four children that depended on him. He was sentenced to be hanged, a verdict that was carried out on 21 January 1949.

The coup was organized primarily by Major Kenji Hatanaka, and though quite a number of men were involved in the plot at one point or another, Shiizaki was one of the few to be involved in the climactic action; the rebels, with the help of the First Imperial Guard Division, seized the Imperial Palace, held Emperor Hirohito under, essentially, house arrest, and sought to destroy the phonographic recordings which had been made of the Emperor's surrender speech. Sometime around seven o'clock on the morning of August 15, the plot began to fall apart. General Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Eastern District Army, arrived at the Palace and harangued the conspirators on their duty to their country, and demanding that the dishonor brought by their treason could only be absolved through seppuku. Shiizaki, along with a number of others, committed ritual suicide that morning, on the grounds of the Imperial Palace.

It was used as an antidepressant in some European countries, and produced a stimulant effect that is similar to the amphetamines, except without any signs of dependence. It was discovered and brought to market in 1976 by Imperial Chemical Industries and was withdrawn from the market in the early 2000s for business reasons.  Uses  Viloxazine hydrochloride was used in some European countries for the treatment of clinical depression.  Side effects  Side effects included nausea, vomiting, insomnia, loss of appetite, increased erythrocyte sedimentation, EKG and EEG anomalies, epigastric pain, diarrhea, constipation, vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, edema of the lower extremities, dysarthria, tremor, psychomotor agitation, mental confusion, inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, increased transaminases, seizure, (there were three cases worldwide, and most animal studies (and clinical trials that included epilepsy patients) indicated the presence of anticonvulsant properties, so was not completely contraindicated in epilepsy,) and increased libido. = Drug interactions = Viloxazine increased plasma levels of phenytoin by an average of 37%. It also was known to significantly increase plasma levels of theophylline and decrease its clearance from the body, sometimes resulting in accidental overdose of theophylline.  Mechanism of action  Viloxazine, like imipramine, inhibited norepinephrine reuptake in the hearts of rats and mice; unlike imipramine, it did not block reuptake of norepinephrine in either the medullae or the hypothalami of rats. As for serotonin, while its reuptake inhibition was comparable to that of desipramine (i.e., very weak), viloxazine did potentiate serotonin-mediated brain functions in a manner similar to amitriptyline and imipramine, which are relatively potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake. Unlike any of the other drugs tested, it did not exhibit any anticholinergic effects. It was also found to up-regulate GABAB receptors in the frontal cortex of rats. Chemical properties It is a racemic compound with two stereoisomers, the (S)-(‚Äì)-isomer being five times as pharmacologically active as the (R)-(+)-isomer. History Viloxazine was discovered by scientists at Imperial Chemical Industries when they recognized that some beta blockers inhibited serotonin reuptake inhibitor activity in the brain at high doses. To improve the ability of their compounds to cross the blood brain barrier, they changed the ethanolamine side chain of beta blockers to a morpholine ring, leading to the synthesis of viloxazine.Williams DA.

Psychiatry portfolio Page accessed August 1, 2015 Research Viloxazine has undergone two randomized controlled trials for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children, both of those times versus imipramine. By 1990, it was seen as a less cardiotoxic alternative to imipramine, and to be especially effective in heavy sleepers. In narcolepsy, viloxazine has been shown to suppress auxiliary symptoms such as cataplexy and also abnormal sleep-onset REM without really improving daytime somnolence. In a cross-over trial (56 participants) viloxazine significantly reduced EDS and cataplexy. Viloxazine has also been studied for the treatment of alcoholism, with some success.

Plot summary In 1957, nine-year-old Jim Norman and his twelve-year-old brother, Wayne, walk to the local library to return Jim's books. They are attacked by a gang of local greasers. Wayne is stabbed to death by two of the older boys, but Jim escapes. Through random times in his life, Jim is haunted by nightmares vividly reenacting the murder. In 1974, Jim is married. He returns to his home town of Stratford, Connecticut, to accept a job as an English teacher. All seems to go well until after the Christmas holiday. Jim learns that one of his students was killed in a hit and run accident. A new student is added to Jim's class. Jim recognizes the boy as Robert Lawson, one of the greasers who killed his brother. Lawson appears to be the same age as he was in 1957. Another student falls to her death a week later, and another of the greasers, David Garcia, joins Jim's class. He also appears to be the same age as he was in 1957. When the class troublemaker expresses to Jim his concerns about the suspicious new arrivals, then drops out of school to join a hippie commune - a third greaser, Vincent 'Vinnie' Corey, joins the class. Terrified, Jim calls an old acquaintance, Donald Nell, a policeman who knew him and his brother in 1957. Donald reveals that the three greasers died soon after Wayne's murder; they were fleeing police in a high-speed car chase only to collide with a telephone pole, causing all three to be electrocuted. Jim does not tell his wife Sally about the greasers, believing it would be better for her not to know. Sally is killed while riding a taxi cab when the resurrected greasers force the vehicle off the road. Finally, after consulting a book of spells, Jim summons a demon; cutting off his own index fingers as a blood sacrifice, he asks that it defeat the undead greasers. In response, the demon takes the shape of Wayne, who overpowers the greasers and takes their souls to Hell. As it leaves, the demon promises that it will return, and Jim recalls a warning from the book: although demons can be summoned and banished, \\"sometimes they come back.\\" Adaptations A TV movie adaptation starring Tim Matheson as Jim aired in 1991. The story was originally planned to be part of the 1985 film Cat's Eye, which included two other stories adapted from Night Shift (\\"The Ledge\\" and \\"Quitters, Inc\\"). However, producers thought the segment would do better on its own. In the film adaptation, Jimmy's brother Wayne comes back after Mueller (one of the original greasers who had survived the crash) sacrifices himself; he learned from the resurrected greasers that a dead person can come back when a living person dies. Jim's wife is not killed. Wayne's return is not sinister, and instead gives Wayne closure, allowing him to move on to the afterlife. The TV movie was followed by two straight-to-video sequels in 1996 (Sometimes They Come Back... Again) and 1998 (Sometimes They Come Back... for More).

Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The coupling rods transfer the power of drive to all wheels. Development Locomotion No 1 was the first locomotive to employ coupling rods rather than chains. In the 1930s reliable roller bearing coupling rods were developed.Tracy V. Buckwalter, Locomotive Drive, , granted Mar. 13, 1934. Allowance for Vertical Motion Hinged side rods connecting the driving wheels of a 4-8-4 locomotive. In general, all railroad vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, irregularities in the track could lift wheels off the rail and cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles. Driving wheels are typically mounted so that they have around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vertical motion. When there are only 2 coupled axles, this range of motion places only slight stress on the crank pins. With more axles, however, provision must be made to allow each axle to move vertically independently of the others without bending the rods. This may be done by hinging the side rod at each intermediate crank pin, either using the pin itself as a hinge pin,Robert Humble, Connecting-Rod, , granted Oct. 16, 1888.William G. Knight, Locomotive Driving Rod Connection, , granted May 18, 1931. or adding a hinge joint adjacent to the pin, as shown in the illustration. An alternative is to use a side rod that spans multiple axles with a scotch yoke used at each intermediate axle. This approach was quite common when side rods were used to link a jackshaft to 2 or more driving wheels on electric locomotives and some early internal combustion locomotives. The Swiss Ce 6/8II Crocodile locomotive is a prominent example, but there were others.Archibald H. Ehle, Internal-Combustion Locomotive, , granted Mar. 1, 1910General Construction, Baldwin Gasoline Industrial Locomotives Baldwin Locomotive Works Record, No. 74, 1913; pages 7-9. The reason for the scotch yoke is given explicitly on page 8.Norman W. Storer, Electric Locomotive, , granted May 2, 1911. Balancing outside-frame dual-mode electro-diesel locomotive, a Swiss Tem II shunter. The coupling rod's off-center attachment to the crank pin of the driving wheel inevitably creates an eccentric movement and vibration when in motion. To compensate for this, the driving wheels of an inside-frame locomotive always had built-in counterweights to offset the angular momentum of the coupling rods, as shown in the figures above. On outside-frame locomotives, the counterweight could be on the driving wheel itself, or it could be on the crank outside the frame, as shown in the adjacent figure. Where the motion of the side-rods is purely circular, as on locomotives driven by jackshafts or geared transmission to one driver, counterweights can balance essentially all of the motion of the side rods. Where part of the motion is non-circular, for example, the horizontal motion of a piston rod, counterweights on the wheels or drive axles cannot be made to balance the entire assembly perfectly. On a driving wheel supporting both side-rods and the connecting rod to a piston, the counterweight needed to balance the horizontal motion of the piston and connecting rod would be heavier than the counterweight needed to balance the vertical weight of the rods. As a result, a counterweight chosen to minimize the total vibration will not minimize the vertical component of the vibration. The vertical component of the vibration that could not be eliminated because of the weight needed to balance the pistons is called hammering. This is destructive to both the locomotive and the roadbed. In some locomotives, this hammering can be so intense that at speed, the drivers alternately jump from the rail head, then slam down hard on the rails as the wheels complete their rotation. Unfortunately, hammering is inherent to conventional two-cylinder piston- driven steam locomotives and that is one of the several reasons they have been retired from service. Materials Initially, coupling rods were made of steel. As technology progressed and better materials became available, the connecting rods were manufactured of lighter and stronger alloys, which in turn permitted smaller counterweights and also reduced hammering.

Jayapala was born to a Hindu family in Peshawar. His kingdom stretched from Laghman to Kashmir and Sirhind to Multan, with Peshawar being in the center. He was the son of Maharaja Hutpal and the father of Maharaja Anandapala. Epithets from the Bari Kot inscriptions record his full title as \\"Parama Bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Sri Jayapaladeva\\".  History  Maharaja Jayapala is known successfully defending his kingdom against the Ghaznavids in the modern-day eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan region his entire life, until finally being defeated in Peshawar due to a snowstorm. Maharaja Jayapala saw a danger in the consolidation of the Ghaznavids and invaded their capital city of Ghazni both in the reign of Sebuktigin and in that of his son Mahmud, which initiated the Muslim Ghaznavid and Hindu Shahi struggles. Jayapala, however, was defeated, and he was forced to pay an indemnity to Sebuktigin. Maharaja Jayapala stopped paying tribute and took to the battlefield once more. Maharaja Jayapala, however, lost the battle and control of the entire region between the Kabul Valley and Khyber Pass. Before his struggle began Maharaja Jayapala had raised a small army of Punjabis. When Jayapala went to the Punjab region, his army was raised of 10,000 horsemen and an smaller host of foot soldiers. According to Firishta: However, the army was hopeless in battle against the eastern forces, particularly against the Punjabis. In the year 1001, soon after Sultan Mahmud came to power and was occupied with the Qarakhanids north of the Hindu Kush, Maharaja Jayapala attacked Ghazni once more and upon suffered his first defeat by the powerful numerous Ghaznavid forces, near present-day Peshawar. After the Battle of Peshawar, Jayapala was captured, and although he was freed by a 50 elephant indemnity, he was ashamed since, as a member of the kshatriya caste, capture (or two defeats to a Muslim, depending on the source) meant a loss of caste. He abdicated in favor of his son and committed suicide by funeral pyre.Ferishta (trans. Dow, A.), The History of Hindoostan, vol.1, p.57 Succession Maharaja Jayapala was succeeded by his son Maharaja Anandapala, who along with other succeeding generations of the Shahiya dynasty took part in various campaigns against the advancing Ghaznavids for decades successfully keeping them from crossing the Indus.

Early life Athanasios Diakos was born Athanasios Nikolaos Massavetas in Phocis, in the village of Ano Mousounitsa, or according to other sources in nearby Artotina. The grandson of a local outlaw, or klepht, he was drawn to religion from an early age and was sent away by his parents to the Monastery of St. John The Baptist (), near Artotina, for his education. He became a monk at the age of seventeen and, due to his devotion to his faith and good temperament, was ordained a Greek Orthodox deacon not long afterwards. Popular tradition has it that while at the monastery, an Ottoman Pasha visited with his troops and was impressed by Athanasios's good looks. The young Athanasios took offence to the Turk's remarks (and subsequent proposal) and the ensuing altercation resulted in the death of the Turkish official. Athanasios was forced to flee into the nearby mountains and become a klepht. Soon afterwards he adopted the pseudonym \\"Diakos\\", or Deacon. Klepht and Armatolos Diakos served under a number of local klepht leaders in the region of Roumeli, distinguishing himself in various encounters with the Ottomans. He also served for a time as a mercenary in the army of Ali Pasha of Ioannina in Epirus, where he befriended Odysseas Androutsos, another klepht. When Androutsos became the captain of a unit of armatoloi at Livadeia, Diakos served for a time as his protopallikaro (literally \\"first warrior\\", or lieutenant). In the years leading up to the Greek War of Independence, Diakos had formed his own band of klephtes and, like many other klepht and armatoloi captains, he had become a member of the Filiki Eteria. Independence fighter The Battle of Alamana, by Alexandros Isaias Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Diakos and a local brigand captain and friend, Vasilis Bousgos, led a contingent of fighters to capture the town of Livadeia. On 1 April 1821, after three days of vicious house-by- house fighting, and the burning of Mir Aga's residence, including the harem, the Greeks liberated the town. Hursid Pasha sent two of his most competent commanders from Thessaly, Omer Vryonis and K√∂se Mehmed, at the head of 8,000 men with orders to put down the revolt in Roumeli and then proceed to the Peloponnese and lift the siege at Tripolitsa.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

Diakos and his band, reinforced by the fighters of Dimitrios Panourgias and Yiannis Dyovouniotis, decided to halt the Ottoman advance into Roumeli by taking defensive positions near Thermopylae. The Greek force of 1,500 men was split into three sections. Dyovouniotis was to defend the bridge at Gorgopotamos, Panourgias the heights of Halkomata, and Diakos the bridge at Alamana.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

Setting out from their camp at Lianokladi, near Lamia, the Ottoman Turks soon divided their force. The main force attacked Diakos. The other attacked Dyovouniotis, whose force was quickly routed, and then Panourgias, whose men retreated when he was wounded. The majority of the Greek force having fled, the Ottomans concentrated their attack on Diakos's position at the Alamana bridge. Seeing that it was a matter of time before they were overrun by the enemy, Bousgos, who had been fighting alongside Diakos, pleaded with him to retreat to safety. Diakos chose to stay and fight with 48 men; they put up a desperate hand-to-hand struggle for a number of hours before being overwhelmed.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

This was a metaphor for the independence and freedom of Greece. The brutal manner of Diakos's death initially struck fear into the populace of Roumeli, but his final stand near Thermopylae, echoing the heroic defence of the Spartan King Leonidas, made him a martyr for the Greek cause. A monument now stands at the bridge near Alamana, the site of his final battle. His alleged birthplace, the village of Ano Mousounitsa, was later renamed Athanasios Diakos in his honour. The Greek Army honoured him with the rank of general. Also streets and statues in several parts of Greece as well as in nearly every one of the larger towns and cities bear his name.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be. While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally. Impostor syndrome also occurs in the context of mental illness and its treatment. Certain individuals may see themselves as less ill (less depressed, less anxious) than their peers or other mentally ill people, citing their lack of severe symptoms as the indication of no or a minor underlying issue. People with this form don't seek help for their issues, seeing their problems as not worthy of psychiatric attention.  History  The term impostor phenomenon was introduced in 1978 in the article \\"The Impostor Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention\\" by Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Dr. Suzanne A. Imes. Clance and Imes defined impostor phenomenon as an individual experience of self-perceived intellectual phoniness (fraud). The researchers investigated the prevalence of this internal experience by interviewing a sample of 150 high-achieving women. All of the participants had been formally recognized for their professional excellence by colleagues, and had displayed academic achievement through degrees earned and standardized testing scores. Despite the consistent evidence of external validation, these women lacked the internal acknowledgement of their accomplishments. The participants explained how their success was a result of luck, and others simply overestimating their intelligence and abilities. Clance and Imes believed that this mental framework for impostor phenomenon developed from factors such as: gender stereotypes, early family dynamics, culture, and attribution style. The researchers determined that the women who experienced impostor phenomenon showcased symptoms related to depression, generalized anxiety, and low self- confidence. Clance and Imes stated in their 1978 article that, based on their clinical experience, impostor phenomenon was less prevalent in men. They noted that further research was necessary to determine the effects impostor phenomenon has on men. Following the publication in 1978, more research has determined that this experience occurs in demographics outside of just high- achieving, successful women.  Prevalence  In more current research, impostor phenomenon is studied as a reaction to particular stimuli and events. It is a phenomenon (an experience) that occurs in an individual, not a mental disorder. Impostor phenomenon is not recognized in the DSM or ICD, although both of these classification systems recognize low self-esteem and sense of failure as associated symptoms of depression.American Psychiatric Association (2000a). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision: DSM-IV-TR ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. .  Symptoms  Impostor experience may be accompanied by anxiety, stress, rumination, or depression.  Measuring impostor phenomenon  The first scale designated to measure characteristics of impostor phenomenon was designed by Clance in 1985, called the Clance impostor phenomenon scale (CIP). The scale can be used to determine if characteristics of fear are present, and to what extent. The aspects of fear include: fear of evaluation, fear of not continuing success and fear of not being as capable as others. In her 1985 paper, Clance explained that impostor phenomenon can be distinguished by the following six dimensions: * The impostor cycle * The need to be special or the best * Characteristics of superman/superwoman * Fear of failure * Denial of ability and discounting praise * Feeling fear and guilt about success Clance noted that the characteristics of these six dimensions may vary. By this model, for an individual to be considered to experience impostorism, at least two of these aspects have to be present. Clance theorised that the most important aspect to understand the manifestation of this experience can be seen through the impostor cycle she created. = Five types = Building upon decades of research, Valerie Young further looked into fraudulent feelings among high achievers. From her book The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer From the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It, she was able to identify five subgroups this syndrome often falls into. * The perfectionist * The superwoman/man * The natural genius * The soloist * The expert Studies suggest that more than 70% of people experience the impostor syndrome at some point in their career. By identifying the above competency point, steps can be taken towards addressing it. = The impostor cycle = The impostor cycle, as defined by Clance, begins with an achievement-related task. An example of an achievement-related task could be an exercise that was assigned through work or school. Once one has received an assignment, feelings of anxiety, self-doubt, and worry immediately follow. The cycle accounts for two possible reactions that stem from these feelings. One will respond either by over-preparation or by procrastination. If one responds with procrastination, this initial response will turn into a frantic effort to complete the job. Once the task has been completed, there will be a brief period of accomplishment and feeling of relief. If positive feedback is given once the work has been completed and turned in, one will discount the positive feedback. If one responded to the task with over-preparation, the successful outcome will be seen as a result of hard work. If one responds by procrastination, one will view the outcome as a matter of luck. In the impostor cycle, gaining success through hard work or luck is not interpreted as a matter of true, personal ability. This means that it does not matter which mechanism one used to complete the task. Even if the outcome results in a positive response, the feedback given has no effect on one's perception of personal success. This leads one to discount positive feedback. This sequence of events serves as a reinforcement, causing the cycle to remain in motion. With every cycle, feelings of perceived fraudulence, increased self-doubt, depression, and anxiety accumulate. As the cycle continues, increased success leads to the intensification of feeling like a fraud. This experience causes one to remain haunted by one's lack of perceived personal ability. Believing that at any point one can be 'exposed' for who one thinks one really is keeps the cycle in motion. = Gender studies = Studies on impostor phenomenon have received mixed reviews regarding the presence of impostor phenomenon in men and women. Clance and Imes investigated this experience in high achieving women in their 1978 study. Following the publication of this study, researchers have investigated impostor phenomenon in both men and women. Clance and Imes suggested that this experience manifests in women more than in men. A study in 2006 looked at gender differences when exploring a possible relationship between the feeling of being an impostor and the achievement of goals. The researchers concluded that the women who participated in this study experienced impostor phenomenon more so than the men who participated. Other research has shown that women commonly face impostor phenomenon in regard to performance. The perception of ability and power is evidenced in out-performing others. For men, impostor phenomenon is often driven by the fear of being unsuccessful, or not good enough. Despite these differences, there is a significant amount of literature on impostor phenomenon and gender differences stating that it is spread equally among men and women. = Among ethnic minority women in academia = Research findings suggest that impostor syndrome/phenomenon affects women who are members of an ethnic minority mentally and academically. A pattern in the research literature shows that women report experiencing impostor phenomenon more frequently than men. Ethnic minority women are also often afflicted with impostor syndrome in elite universities. Some researchers have reported that though certain men do sometimes experience doubt and a feeling of lack of belonging in academia, being a woman and member of an ethnic minority in the United States actually entails being susceptible to encountering \\"hideous forms of racism and sexism\\". Such experiences of racism and sexism, if objectively demonstrable, increase the chance that ethnic minority women may experience impostor phenomenon. The intersection of race and gender for ethnic minority women in academia is important because both identities can heavily impact ethnic minority women and their academic experience, especially if their identities are visible. For example, a black woman in higher education might fear she will be stereotyped as aggressive or angry if she expresses a controversial opinion in class. According to Miller and Kastberg, both crude and subtle forms of racism and sexism make it much more difficult for ethnic minority women to break through the barriers of higher education. Another example: explicit racist policies that exclude Asian American women suggest that they do not experience academic barriers. Therefore, these women may not feel as though they are allowed to ask for help. Studies on impostor phenomenon have shown that the intersecting identities of ethnic women in academia affect identity development and goal achievement. For example, Ostrove (2003) found that ethnic women from lower- and middle-class backgrounds reported feeling more alienated from their peers during their time spent at an elite college. Similarly, Walton and Cohen's (2007) work on the effects of racial underrepresentation at elite private universities shows that ethnic women who experience social alienation in academia could easily experience impostor syndrome. Common causes of impostor phenomenon include feelings such as stigma, stereotype threat, or an overall sense of \\"intellectual phoniness\\". For example, a woman attending a predominately white institution is likely to worry unjustifiably that her accomplishments are not good enough relative to her peers' accomplishments, not least if, e.g., she is black and most of her colleagues are male. These thoughts could derive from feeling that she was accepted into that university because of affirmative action or by \\"accident\\".  Occurrence  The feeling of being a fraud that surfaces in impostor phenomenon is not uncommon. It has been estimated that nearly 70% of individuals will experience signs and symptoms of impostor phenomenon at least once in their life. This can be a result of a new academic or professional setting. Research shows that impostor phenomenon is not uncommon for students who enter a new academic environment. Feelings of insecurity can come as a result of an unknown, new environment. This can lead to lower self-confidence and belief in their own abilities. = Settings = Impostor phenomenon can occur in other various settings. Some examples include: * A new environment * Academic settings * In the workplace * Social interactions * Relationships (platonic or romantic) In relationships, people with impostorism often feel they do not live up to the expectations of their friends or loved ones. It is common for the individual with impostorism to think that they must have somehow tricked others into liking them and wanting to spend time with them. They experience feelings of being unworthy, or of not deserving the beneficial relationships they possess. There is empirical evidence that demonstrates the harmful effects of impostor phenomenon in students. Studies have shown that when a student's academic self-concept increases, the symptoms of impostor phenomenon decrease, and vice versa. The worry and emotions the students held, had a direct impact of their performance in the program. Common facets of impostor phenomenon in the class-room include: * Students compared themselves to their class-mates * Students did not feel prepared academically when they compared themselves to their class- mates * Students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program * Students perceived that positive recognition, awards, and good grades stemmed from external factors, not from personal ability or intelligence. Cokley et al. investigated the impact impostor phenomenon has on students, specifically ethnic minority students. They found that the feelings the students had of being fraudulent resulted in psychological distress. Ethnic minority students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program. They held the false assumption that they only received their acceptance due to affirmative action‚Äîrather than an extraordinary application and qualities they had to offer. = Connections = Research has shown that there is a relationship between impostor phenomenon and the following factors: * Family expectations * Overprotective parent(s) or legal guardian(s) * Graduate-level coursework * Racial identities * Attribution style * Anxiety * Depression * Low trait self-esteem * Perfectionism * Excessive self-monitoring, with an emphasis on self-worth The aspects listed are not mutually exclusive. These components are often found to correlate among individuals with impostor phenomenon. It is incorrect to infer that the correlational relationship between these aspects cause the impostor experience. In individuals with impostor phenomenon, feelings of guilt often result in a fear of success. The following are examples of common notions that lead to feelings of guilt and reinforce the phenomenon. * The good education they were able to receive * Being acknowledged by others for success * Belief that it is not right or fair to be in a better situation than a friend or loved one * Being referred to as: ** \\"The smart one\\" ** \\"The talented one\\" ** \\"The responsible one\\" ** \\"The sensitive one\\" ** \\"The good one\\" ** \\"Our favorite\\"  Management  In their 1978 paper, Clance and Imes proposed a therapeutic approach they used for their participants or clients with impostor phenomenon. This technique includes a group setting where various individuals meet others who are also living with this experience. The researchers explained that group meetings made a significant impact on their participants. They proposed that it was the realization that they were not the only ones who experienced these feelings. The participants were required to complete various homework assignments as well. In one assignment, participants recalled all of the people they believed they had fooled or tricked in the past. In another take-home task, individuals wrote down the positive feedback they had received. Later, they would have to recall why they received this feedback and what about it made them perceive it in a negative light. In the group sessions, the researchers also had the participants re-frame common thoughts and ideas about performance. An example would be to change: \\"I might fail this exam\\" to \\"I will do well on this exam\\". The researchers concluded that simply extracting the self-doubt before an event occurs helps eliminate feelings of impostorism. It was recommended that the individuals struggling with this experience seek support from friends and family. Although impostor phenomenon is not a pathological condition, it is a distorted system of belief about oneself that can have a powerful negative impact on an individual's valuation of their own worth. Other research on therapeutic approaches for impostorism emphasizes the importance of self-worth. Individuals who live with impostor phenomenon commonly relate self-esteem and self-worth to others. A major aspect of other therapeutic approaches for impostor phenomenon focus on separating the two into completely separate entities. In a study in 2013, researcher Queena Hoang proposed that intrinsic motivation can decrease the feelings of being a fraud that are common in impostor phenomenon. This includes a series of re-framing current ideas. The following are examples listed in Hoang's 2013 paper: * \\"I want to receive that degree. I won't give up and have too much pride to walk away.\\" * \\"If I can do this, I will be able to help others in the future and work with people as motivated as I am.\\" * \\"I can be the voice of other People of Color who do not have the opportunities like I do.\\" * \\"I know I can do this.\\" * Learning how to \\"be your own person.\\" * Learning how to accept and believe compliments. Hoang also suggested that implementing a mentor program for new or entering students will minimize students' feelings of self-doubt. Having a mentor who has been in the program will help the new students feel supported. This allows for a much smoother and less overwhelming transition. Impostor experience can be addressed with many kinds of psychotherapy. Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with cognitive therapy. Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with acceptance and commitment therapy. Group psychotherapy is an especially common and effective way of alleviating the impostor experience.. By those who have an interest in providing such behaviourist psychotherapy, the appropriateness of any kind of psychotherapeutic intervention for a non-pathological, alleged cognitive aberration is never questioned. It should, however, be questioned by those to whom it is offered, since the origins of the misperception by an individual of their own qualities, condition or situation may be social or philosophical rather than purely cognitive.  Society and culture  Maya Angelou: \\"I have written 11 books, but each time I think, 'Uh oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game on everybody, and they're going to find me out.'\\" Various individuals who are often in the spotlight have shared that they have experienced feeling like a fraud. Journalist Diana Crow stated, \\"I spent a lot of time not applying to awards for a couple of years.\\" When she did receive some of those awards, it reinforced the feelings of impostorism. She stated, \\"There's a little bit of wondering whether what won an award is actually award-worthy.\\" The following list includes other well known individuals who have reportedly experienced this phenomenon: * Maya Angelou * Mike Cannon-Brookes * Tommy Cooper * Neil Gaiman * Tom Hanks * Chuck Lorre * Michelle Obama * Michelle Pfeiffer * Mauro Ranallo * Adam Savage * Sonia Sotomayor * Nicola Sturgeon *David TennantDavid Tennant Fights the Demon of Imposter Syndrome theoffcamerashow * Emma Watson * Robbie Williams * Thom Yorke  See also  * Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect a cognitive bias wherein people of non-average ability (both high and low) see themselves as a bit above average * Explanatory style how people typically explain events to themselves * Illusory superiority a cognitive bias whereby a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities * Inner critic * \\"Fakin' It\\" (Simon & Garfunkel song) 60s-era pop/rock song on the subject * Jonah complex the fear of success which prevents the realisation of one's potential * Mindset * Poseur * Self- handicapping * * Tall poppy syndrome aspects of a culture where people of high status are resented for having been viewed as superior to their peers  References   External links  Category:1978 introductions Category:Popular psychology Category:Words coined in the 1970s ","title":"Impostor syndrome"},{"id":"2177413","text":"Wƒôgr√≥w may refer to: *Wƒôgr√≥w, a town in eastern Poland in the Masovian Voivodeship *WeGrow Store, a hydroponics franchise for medicinal marijuana See also * Wƒôgr√≥w (disambiguation) ","title":"Wegrow"},{"id":"2177426","text":"Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin (2 April 1790 in Saint-Paul-en-Jarez ‚Äì 13 May 1847) was a pioneering French surgeon and gynecologist.

Gaston de Foix, duc de Nemours (10 December 1489 ‚Äì 11 April 1512), byname The Thunderbolt of Italy,William Hickling Prescott, History of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic, (Southern Illinois University Press, 1962), 288. was a famed French military commander of the Renaissance. Nephew of King Louis XII of France and general of his armies in Italy from 1511 to 1512, he is noted for his absolutely outstanding military feats in a career which lasted no longer than a few months. The young general is regarded as a stellar commander well ahead of his time. An adept of lightning fast forced marches as well as sudden and bold offensives that destabilized contemporary armies and commanders, De Foix is mostly remembered for his brilliant six-month campaign against the Holy League in the War of the League of Cambrai. He met his end in said conflict, at the age of 21, during the Battle of Ravenna (1512), the last of his triumphs. Born in Maz√®res, County of Foix, he was the second child but only son of John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne and Marie d'Orl√©ans.Frederic J. Baumgartner, Louis XII, (St. Martin's Press, 1996), 146. His older sister was Germaine of Foix, Queen consort of Aragon as the second wife of Ferdinand II. His paternal grandparents were Gaston IV of Foix-Grailly and Queen regnant Eleanor of Navarre. His maternal grandparents were Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans and Marie of Cleves. His only maternal uncle was Louis XII of France. Life In 1511, Gaston arrived in Italy as a new commander at the age of 21. His presence and energy shifted the conflict into much higher levels of activity. French forces had captured Bologna on 13 May 1511 and were under siege from a combined Papal-Spanish army commanded by Ram√≥n de Cardona, the Viceroy of Naples. Gaston marched his army to Bologna and scattered the armies of the Holy League that retreated to Ravenna. In October 1511, Pope Julius II formed the Holy League with Ferdinand of Aragon and Venice. Its stated aim was to recover the lands taken from the Papacy, and this meant driving the French out of Italy. So Gaston now faced an invasion from the Swiss from the north, the Papal-Aragonese from the south and Venice from the east. The Swiss took Bellinzona in December 1511, but Gaston refrained from attacking them, fearing that if he left Milan then the people would rebel behind his back. Instead he reinforced Bologna that was under renewed attack from Julius II's army. The Swiss unable to draw Gaston out, retreated as winter set in. In February 1512, Gaston left Milan to relieve Brescia under attack from Venice, and beat them. It is said that when Julius II heard of the defeat he tore out his beard, but in the meantime Cardona had retaken most of the Romagna. Gaston force marched his army south through the snow to arrive at Ravenna unexpectedly and threatened to besiege it. Cardona at Imola now encamped his army on marshy ground before Ravenna. Gaston had about 23,000 soldiers, 8,500 of which were German landsknechte, and 54 artillery pieces. Cardona had roughly 16,000 troops and 30 artillery pieces; the garrison of Ravenna could count about 5,000 men. Gaston sent a formal invitation for battle to Cardona, who readily accepted.The Death of Gaston de Foix at Ravenna by the 19th century artist Ary Scheffer. The decisive Battle of Ravenna was fought on 11 April 1512. The Spanish had their backs to the Ronco River and maintained a relatively secure front thanks to the strong entrenchments and obstacles prepared by the famous engineer Pedro Navarro. Gaston left 2,000 men to watch Ravenna and moved the rest of his force against Cardona. The French army crossed the stream between Ravenna and the Spanish camp without interference, formed in a semicircle around the enemy entrenchments, and started firing from the flanks into the Spanish position. The heavy bombardment did not trouble the well-protected Spanish infantry, but the cavalry could take no more and assaulted the French without orders. These charges were easily beaten back and the French counter- attacked. A bloody one-hour struggle ensued between the landsknechts and the Spanish in the entrenchments. At this moment, two cannons that Gaston had sent behind the Spanish lines opened fire and wrought havoc on the enemy rear. The Spanish withdrew and suffered tremendous casualties. During the pursuit, Gaston led a cavalry charge against a retreating Spanish infantry unit. His horse stumbled, he fell, and was shot and killed.Knecht, Robert, \\"The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France\\", Blackwell, 2001 French casualties were up to 9,000 while the Spanish lost nearly their entire army, as well as Pedro Navarro, who was captured. Although the French victory at Ravenna allowed them to take that city and other important towns in the area, the death of Gaston and over a third of his army fatally weakened the French power in north Italy. When the Swiss returned and joined the Venetians and together marched on Milan, the new French Commander La Police and his demoralised army fled back to the Dauphin√© in June. Ironically, Ferdinand of Aragon, whose forces Gaston fought at Ravenna, had married his sister Germaine de Foix. She now inherited Gaston's claim to the Kingdom of Navarre against the ruling d'Albret family. Ferdinand invaded Navarre and was able to conquer and retain all of its Spanish territories. Tomb Grave of Gaston of Foix, Castello Sforzesco, Milan. A very elaborate tomb was commissioned for Gaston in Milan from the workshop of Agostino Busti,Milan, Renaissance and Reformation, Vol. 6, ed. James Patrick, (Marshall Cavendish, 2007), 645. which despite never being completed and assembled remains a key work in art history, and especially French Renaissance art, with (as planned) classicising relief panels of his campaigns around the base of the sarcophagus, surmounted by a more traditional recumbent effigy. Most of the pieces are on display in the Castello Sforzesco.

It is a part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite medical campuses in Savannah, Albany, Rome, and Athens. It employs over 15,000 people, has more than 56,000 alumni, and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The Augusta University Health System includes the 478-bed Augusta University Medical Center, the 154-bed Children's Hospital of Georgia, and more than 80 outpatient clinics. Campus The Health Sciences Building hosts a variety of departments and classes. Augusta University's main campus in Augusta, Georgia, encompasses more than 200 acres and has four local campuses. It is made up of the former campuses between Augusta State University and Georgia Health Sciences University, with additions from the University System of Georgia Board of Regents. =Health Sciences= The Health Sciences campus first began in 1913 as the college moved to the Newton building and expanded from there, with the Dugas Building in 1937 marking the earliest building currently on the campus. The first clinical facility opened as the Eugene Talmadge Memorial Hospital in 1956. Located in Augusta's Medical District, the Health Sciences campus features all medical programs of the university, as well as the Health Sciences Building, Interdisciplinary Research Building, Wellness Center, Cancer Center, Medical College of Georgia, and Dental College of Georgia. The Health Sciences campus also contains the Augusta University Medical Center, the Children's Hospital of Georgia, and Augusta University's two residence halls, Oak Hall and Elm Hall, which opened in Fall 2016. =Summerville= Augusta University Summerville campus The Summerville campus was originally used as a United States Army arsenal, established downtown in 1816 and relocated to the campus in 1827. By the turn of the twentieth century, the arsenal's prominence waned, beginning with the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in that the arsenal produced manufacturing equipment, seacoast targets, and was a repair station. In World War I, the station repaired rifles and small arms, but produced ordnance material and fire control operations for World War II. In 1955, the arsenal was closed, and two years later the land was given to the local Board of Education, which used it to open the Junior College of Augusta. In 1958, the name changed to Augusta College, and in 1996 to Augusta State University. Located on Walton Way, the Summerville campus houses many of the undergraduate programs and the Jaguar Student Activities Center. The Maxwell Performing Arts Theatre, the History Walk, the Mary S. Byrd Gallery of Art, The Honors Program, and the Maxwell Alumni House are all found on this campus. In addition, the James M. Hull College of Business, College of Education, College of Science and Mathematics, and Pamplin College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences are located here. The campus was formerly well known for the Arsenal Oak, a tree that contained wood believed to be 250‚Äì400 years old, until it was cut down in June 2004 because of disease. A dedication ceremony of the replanting of the new Arsenal Oak took place on Friday, April 29, 2016, on the front lawn of the Ben√©t House. The descendant was grown from an acorn of the original Arsenal Oak. =Forest Hills= A par 3 hole at Forest Hills Then-Augusta State University opened a second campus in 1991 for athletics, complete with a 3,800-seat arena‚ÄîChristenberry Fieldhouse, named in 2003‚Äîand softball and baseball fields. The J. Fleming Norvell Golf House was added in 2007 with an adjacent driving range, putting green, and chipping area. The campus contains Forest Hills Golf Club, home of the men's and women's golf teams and a public course available for play, and the 500-bed University Village student housing. =The Nathan Deal Campus for Innovation= The former Georgia Golf Hall of Fame riverfront property in Downtown Augusta has been developed to house the Augusta University Cyber Institute and the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center which opened in July 2018. The Riverfront Campus was named in honor of Georgia Governor Nathan Deal who was on hand for the opening ceremony of the Hull-McKnight Building on the campus. A second cyber building will open in December 2018 with potential plans to expand more on the property. =Other= Augusta University has three satellite campuses for clinical study, in Albany, Rome, and Savannah. Partnerships =UGA‚ÄìMCG medical partnership= The College of Nursing has a satellite campus in Athens. AU's Medical College of Georgia (MCG) operates a partnership with the University of Georgia on the University of Georgia's new Health Sciences Campus, also in Athens. In 2010, MCG partnered with the University of Georgia (UGA) to create the UGA-MCG Medical Partnership. The Medical Partnership combines the experience of one of the nation's first medical schools with the resources of one of the nation's most comprehensive leading nationally ranked research universities. The result is an education that allows medical students to reach their full potential in a unique and stimulating learning environment. To accommodate its new Health Sciences Campus, in 2011 the University of Georgia acquired the 58-acre former U.S. Navy Supply Corps School which had extensive landscaped green spaces, more than 400 trees, and several historic buildings located on the hospital and medical office corridor of Prince Avenue near downtown Athens. After renovations and additions, in July 2012, the UGA-MCG Medical Partnership moved to the new University of Georgia Health Sciences Campus. =ECRH‚ÄìAU medical partnership= East Central Regional Hospital contains two locations in Augusta and Gracewood, was taken over by GRU for administrative purposes in 2009 after the facility was considered for closure. The university's College of Nursing is actively involved in the daily activities, including patient care. The hospital specializes in behavioral health and mental disabilities. =US Army Cyber Center of Excellence at Fort Gordon‚ÄìAU Cyber Institute partnership= Fort Gordon is home to the US Army Cyber Center of Excellence and the US Army Cyber Command. The partnership will strengthen the relationship between AU and ARCYBER by assisting soldiers transferring their training to the private sector as well as by sharing resources. The ribbon-cutting and opening ceremony of Augusta University's Cyber Institute took place in University Hall on the Summerville campus on Friday, September 16, 2016. =East Georgia State College Augusta= In 2013, East Georgia State College (EGSC), a University System of Georgia institution based in the rural city of Swainsboro, began a collaboration with AU to serve Augusta-area students who do not meet AU's freshman admission requirements. Students enrolled in the program are enrolled as EGSC students and attend classes on the Summerville Campus. After completing 30 semester hours of college level coursework and attaining a minimum GPA of 2.3, students can then elect to transfer into a bachelor's program at AU. This collaboration is modeled after EGSC's long-standing collaboration with Georgia Southern University and replaces the former \\"University College\\" program. Athletics Augusta competes at the NCAA Division I level in women's and men's golf and is a Division II participant in its 11 other sports (women's and men's cross country, women's volleyball, women's and men's basketball, women's and men's tennis, softball, baseball and women's and men's outdoor track & field). The mascot is the Jaguar. The men's golf program captured the school's first NCAA Division I Men's Golf National Championship on June 6, 2010 in Ooltewah, Tennessee, when the Jaguars defeated Oklahoma State University. The Jags then became the first Division I men's golf program in 27 years to repeat as National Champions on June 5, 2011 when they defeated the University of Georgia at Karsten Creek Golf Club in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Okawara was the first in the industry to be specifically credited as a mechanical designer. He designed mecha for the Gundam and Brave Series franchises, as well as those of numerous Super Robot and Real Robot shows. He was born and currently lives in Inagi, Tokyo, where he works out of a studio in his home. Biography =Formative years= Okawara attended Tokyo Zokei University as a student in its graphic design department, moving to its textile design department one year later. Following graduation, he had been assigned by his school to a position as a fashion designer at the apparel company Onward Kashiyama Co. Ltd., where he also drew display backgrounds for their specialty store. Through the experience of drawing background art, he was led to take an art position at the animation company Tatsunoko Production; there, he (on suggestion from art director Mitsuki Nakamura) was assigned to design the enemy mecha for Science Ninja Team Gatchaman--soon devoting his time to that brand of design almost exclusively thereafter during Tatsunoko's production of Hurricane Polymar and Tekkaman: The Space Knight. This would prompt Nakamura to found the internal Tatsunoko \\"Design Office Mechaman\\" with Okawara (which later spun off from Tatsunoko), where Okawara would receive the first ever recorded industry credit of \\"mechanical designer.\\" Ultimately, he would go on to design of the title mecha of the show GowappƒÅ 5 Godam, hitting his stride at the company. =With Sunrise= Following the first two Time Bokan series in 1978, Okawara would leave Tatsunoko Production as an employee, striking out on his own as an independent contractor for \\"mechanical design.\\" In addition to handling occasional design contracts from his old employer, he became a fixture at the studio Nippon Sunrise (one half of the studio that would later become Sunrise, Inc.). His first assignment from the studio would be principal mechanical design on the Super Robot show Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3, directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino. Tomino would soon ask Okawara to continue to work with him on a new robot-oriented television project that he had tentatively named \\"Gunboy.\\" In a then unheard-of move, Tomino instructed Okawara to design more \\"realistic,\\" practically-designed title mecha for the series, closer to lines of the Mobile Infantry Powered Suits described in the Robert A. Heinlein novel Starship Troopers, rather than the fanciful iron giants depicted since the airing of Mazinger Z. The result would be AFA 08 About Okawara 2008 Retrieved 2008-04-22Mobile Suit Gundam: a show which would cause a model kit boom in Japan and spark a new interest in mecha design, as well as originate the entire Real Robot genre prevalent among televised anime in the 1980s. Following Mobile Suit Gundam, Okawara would continue to design mecha for later entries in the emerging Gundam franchise as well as many later Real Robot shows emerging from Sunrise. Notable in the 1980s alone were his works on Combat Mecha Xabungle, Fang of the Sun Dougram, Armored Trooper VOTOMS, Galactic Drifter Vifam and Blue Comet SPT Layzner. The late 1980s and early 1990s would soon see him joined by other mechanical designers working on various entries in the Gundam franchise such as Kazumi Fujita, Yutaka Izubuchi, Mamoru Nagano, Mika Akitaka, Makoto Kobayashi and Hajime Katoki, all of whom would provide their own \\"take\\" on Okawara's original work. Okawara himself would take note, their designs in turn inspiring him to expand the scope of his own. In the early 1990s, many of Okawara's designs made an unexpected turn back toward those of classic Super Robots with Brave Exkaiser, the first show in Sunrise's Brave Series funded by Transformers manufacturer Takara. As the series of shows continued, Okawara would go on to design the principal robot for every entry in the Brave Series, culminating in his design of almost every robot seen in The King of Braves GaoGaiGar--the series' final televised entry--as well as the show's OVA sequel, The King of Braves GaoGaiGar FINAL. In 2004, Okawara's fame as a mecha designer led him to be contracted by the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa (Ishikawa) to design a type of head-mounted display used in the museum's \\"SYS*O17\\" electronic exhibit, created by Mathieu Briand. While describing the exhibit to museum management, Briand had referred to the subtle shape of Gundam's mecha when describing the displays he had intended to use; this in turn had led to the museum bringing Okawara into the project. =Current projects= Today, Okawara continues to design various title mecha in the Gundam franchise, most recently those related to Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn.

Tomb of Ramon de Cardona, by Giovanni da Nola. Ramon Folc de Cardona i Anglesola (Italian: Raimondo di Cardona) (1467 ‚Äì 10 March 1522) was a Spanish general and politician, who served as the viceroy of Naples during the Italian Wars and commanded the Spanish forces in Italy during the War of the League of Cambrai. He was granted the title count of Oliveto in the Kingdom of Naples, on 12 December 1515.  Biography  The son of Antoni de Cardona-Anglesola i Centelles and Castellana de Requesens, he was 5th Baron of Bellpuig, Baron of Linyola and Baron of Utxafava, all three places in Catalonia. Ram√≥n de Cardona was born in Bellpuig, to one of the greatest families in the Crown of Aragon, the Cardona. On 12 December 1502 he was awarded the title of Duke of Soma, taking part in 1505, with the role of admiral, in the capture of Mers-el-K√©bir. King Ferdinand II of Aragon, of whom he has been postulated to be a natural son, made him Viceroy of Naples in 1509. He stayed as Viceroy of Sicily from 1507 to 1509 and coming back to Naples and staying there till his death in 1522. In 1510 he received instructions on introducing the Inquisition in Naples, a decision which caused a popular revolt; after which the Spanish king canceled the decree. Portrait of Do√±a Isabel de Requesens, wife of Ram√≥n de Cardona by Raphael. In 1511 Cardona moved to northern Italy as the commander-in-chief of the League of Cambrai army, leaving the Neapolitan government to his wife Isabel de Requesens, 2nd countess of Palam√≥s, 2nd countess of Avellino, 2nd countess of Trivento, baroness of Calonge, daughter of Galceran de Requesens the first holder of these titles. In the following year he was defeated by Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours at the Battle of Ravenna. Cardona then moved to Tuscany to support the then Spanish-supported House of Medici. His troops besieged Prato, massacring the population after its fall. In 1513 Cardona returned to Lombardy with a new army the following year and fought successfully at the Battle of La Motta, defeating the Venetian army led by Bartolomeo d'Alviano. He was however unable to prevent the Venetians from joining with the French at the Battle of Marignano. In February 1513, after the death of Pope Julius II, (1443‚Äì1513), a.k.a. Giuliano della Rovere and the arrival in Italy of King Francis I of France, Cardona was called back to Spain. In 1515 he had received the title of Count of Alvito, a fiefdom in what is now southern Lazio. In 1519 the new king of Spain, Charles I of Spain, a.k.a. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, made him Great Admiral of the Kingdom of Naples. He died at Naples in 1522. His cenotaph in Bellpuig, executed by Giovanni da Nola, is one of the most outstanding examples of Renaissance art in the region.  Children  He had two children : * Fernando Folch de Cardona, 2nd duke of Soma, 3rd count of Oliveto, 2nd duke of Soma and other titles, Viceroy of Sicily, deceased 13 September 1571. * Caterina de Cardona y Requesens, deceased in 1577, married Don Ferrante d' Aragona, 1st duke of Montalto, illegitimate son of King Ferrante I of Naples and Diana Guardato. Their descendants were the \\"Moncada\\" family, Sicilian Princes of Patern√≤ and Grandees of Spain.

Simpson debuted as a comic book artist in 1984 with his creation Megaton Man, a Kitchen Sink Press title that sometimes satirized superheroes cliches. In April 2013, Simpson received his PhD in History of Art and Architecture from the University of Pittsburgh. Career =Megaton Man= Simpson wrote and drew the 10-issue Kitchen Sink Press comic-book series Megaton Man (Nov. 1984 ‚Äì June 1986) and its three-issue miniseries sequel, The Return of Megaton Man (1988).

In summer 1985, Marvel Comics objected to Simpson's parody superhero team, the Megatropolis Quartet, claiming that Rex Rigid (Mr. Waterballoon/Liquid Man), Stella Starlight (the See-Thru Girl), and Bing Gloom (Yarn Man) too closely resembled its group the Fantastic Four, and issued a \\"cease and desist\\" letter. The publisher responded that the characters fell under the Fair Use doctrine, and Marvel pursued no further legal action.Barry Hoffman, interview with Don Simpson, Gauntlet: Exploring the Limits of Free Expression #2, 1991. Megaton Man and the character's supporting cast appeared throughout Simpson's later self-published series Bizarre Heroes (Fiasco Comics, 1994‚Äì1996), the final two issues of which (#16 and #17) are alternately titled Megaton Man vs. Forbidden Frankenstein #1 and Megaton Man #0.

In 2014, the government established a special religious police unit to deal with religious complaints. The new unit reports to the Ministry of Law and Order, although it is housed in the Buddhist Division of the Ministry of Buddhist Sasana and Religious Affairs.

Work permits for foreign clergy are issued for one year (rather than five years as in the past). It is possible to obtain extensions of work permits. Inter-religious relations The practice of Hinduism was allowed under Sinhalese kings since the Anuradhapura era. Buddhist Sinhalese kings gave protection to Muslims fleeing from Portuguese persecution and to Catholics fleeing from persecution by the Dutch after having been defeated by the Portuguese. This coexistence has been marred by isolated incidents and attacks on religious places by Islamic extremist groups and Buddhist extremist group. Several Hindu temples were attacked in the riots of 1983 in Colombo and South of Sri Lanka. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, the Sri Lankan air force air raided Hindu and Christian shrines in the belief that LTTE rebels had taken shelter in there, with the Navaly church bombing being one notable event. Two of the holiest sites for Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree and the Temple of the Tooth, were attacked and bombed by the secularist LTTE. The LTTE also attacked several Muslim mosques in North-Eastern parts of the country. At times, local police and government officials have appeared to be acting in concert with Buddhist nationalist organizations. In 2013, several non-governmental organisations alleged that government officials provided assistance, or at least tacitly supported the actions of societal groups targeting religious minorities.

It grew moderately, despite elements growing dissatisfied and leaving to form rival Trotskyist groups, through the recruitment of students and work in the factories. It took part in various electoral blocs in the late 1970s. When much of the Italian far left formed the organisation Democrazia Proletaria (Proletarian Democracy) the LCR joined it as a recognised faction.

Colonel Rowe was credited with developing the rigorous US Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training program taught to high-risk military personnel (such as Special Forces and aircrews) and the U.S. Army doctrine which institutionalizes these techniques and principles to be followed by captured personnel. In 1989, Rowe was killed by a unit of the New People's Army in the Philippines called the Alex Boncayao Brigade. Personal life Rowe was born in McAllen, Texas, on February 8, 1938, to Lee Delavan and Florence (Survillo) Rowe. He grew up in McAllen, joining his local DeMolay chapter, and graduated from McAllen High School in 1956 before leaving for the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. His older brother Richard had also attended West Point, but died a few months before graduation in 1944.https://externalapps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/23142/ AOG obituary On December 27, 1969, Rowe married Jane Rowe, whom he later divorced. His second wife was Mary. He had two daughters, Deborah and Christina, from his first marriage and two sons, Stephen and Brian, from his second marriage.Fowler, Glenn. \\"Col. James Rowe, 51, War Hero, is Killed in an Ambush in Manila\\" NY Times April 22, 1989 retrieved August 13, 2015 Military service Rowe graduated from West Point in 1960 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. In 1963, First Lieutenant Rowe was sent to the Republic of Vietnam and assigned as Executive Officer of Detachment A-23, 5th Special Forces Group, a 12-man \\"A-team\\". Located at Tan Phu in An Xuyen Province, A-23 organized and advised a Civilian Irregular Defense Group camp in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. = Prisoner of war = On October 29, 1963, after only three months in country, Rowe was captured by Viet Cong elements along with Captain Humberto \\"Rocky\\" R. Versace and Sergeant Daniel L. Pitzer while on an operation to drive a Viet Cong unit out of the village of Le Coeur. Rowe states that the VC were a main force unit due to his observations of their equipment.Rowe 1971, p.82 Rowe was separated from his fellow Green Berets and spent 62 months in captivity with only brief encounters with fellow American POWs. Rowe was held in the U Minh Forest, better known as the \\"Forest of Darkness,\\" in extreme southern Vietnam. During most of his five years in captivity Rowe was held in a bamboo cage. As an intelligence officer, Rowe possessed vital information about the disposition of defenses around the CIDG camps, the locations of mine field, names of friendly Vietnamese, and unit locations and strength. Rowe had left his West Point ring at home in the United States, and he told his captors that he was a draftee engineer charged with building schools and other civil affairs projects. The Viet Cong interrogated him unsuccessfully. They gave him some engineering problems to solve and Rowe, relying on the basic instruction in engineering he'd received at West Point, successfully maintained his deception. However, Rowe's deceptive cover was blown when the Viet Cong managed to obtain a list of American high-value prisoners-of-war (POWs), and his name was in the list, identifying him as an intelligence officer. This enraged the VC, prompting them to order his execution. Rowe was then led deep into the jungle to be shot. When his would-be executioners were distracted by a flight of American helicopters, he overpowered his guard, escaped and flagged down a UH-1 helicopter piloted by Major David E. Thompson. He was rescued on December 31, 1968. Rowe had been promoted to major during captivity. In 1971, he authored the book Five Years to Freedom, an account of his years as a prisoner of war. In 1974, he continued his military career in the United States Army Reserve. = Designs survival course = In 1981, Rowe was recalled to active duty as a lieutenant colonel to design and build a course based upon his experience as a POW. Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) is now a requirement for graduation from the U.S. Army Special Forces Qualification Course. SERE is taught at the Colonel James \\"Nick\\" Rowe Training compound at Camp Mackall, North Carolina. It is considered by many to be the most important advanced training in the special operations field. Navy, Air Force and Marine Special Operations personnel all attend variations of this course taught by their respective services. = Supports Philippines counter-insurgency = By 1987, Colonel Rowe was assigned as the chief of the Army division of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG), providing counter-insurgency training for the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Working closely with the Central Intelligence Agency and intelligence organizations of the Republic of the Philippines, he was involved in its nearly decade-long program to penetrate the New People's Army (NPA), the communist insurgency that threatened to overthrow the Philippines' government. By February 1989, Rowe had acquired intelligence information which indicated that the communists were planning a major terrorist act. He warned Washington that a high-profile figure was about to be assassinated and that he himself was second or third on the assassination list. At around 7:00 in the morning of April 21, 1989, as he was being driven to work at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group headquarters in an armoured limousine, Rowe's vehicle was hit by gunfire from a .45 caliber pistol and an M16 rifle near a corner of Tomas Morato Street and Timog Avenue in Quezon City. Twenty-one shots hit the vehicle; one round entered through an unarmoured portion of the vehicle frame and struck Rowe in the head, killing him instantly, while chauffeur Joaquin Vinuya was wounded. Years later, the New People's Army eventually claimed responsibility for his assassination. Filipino nationals Juanito T. Itaas (principal) and Donato B. Continente (accomplice) were convicted by a Philippine court in 1991 and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Rowe, and 10 to 17 years for the attempted murder of his driver, Joaquin Vinuya. In 2000 the Supreme Court of the Philippines affirmed the convictions but reduced Continente's sentence to 14 years, concluding that he was acting as an accomplice, not as a principal. Continente was released from prison on June 28, 2005. As of 2014, Itaas remains in prison, serving the remainder of his life term. Rowe was buried on May 2, 1989, in Section 48 of Arlington National Cemetery. Politics Rowe was a staunch conservative and a strong critic of George McGovern in the 1972 presidential campaign. He ran as a Republican for the office of Texas Comptroller in 1974 but was easily defeated by Democrat Bob Bullock in a strongly Democratic year because of the Watergate scandal. Bullock received 1,099,599 votes (71.6%) to Rowe's 419,657 (27.3%). A third party candidate earned the remaining 16,383 (1%) votes. Rowe did not run for office again and Bullock became a two-term lieutenant governor. Memorials *James \\"Nikki\\" Rowe High School and a major street Col.

The B≈Çyskawica (Polish for lightning), was a submachine gun produced by the Armia Krajowa, or Home Army, a Polish resistance movement fighting the Germans in occupied Poland. Together with a Polish version of the Sten sub-machine gun, with which it shares some design elements, it was the only weapon mass- produced covertly in occupied Europe during World War II. Blyskawica submachine gun shoulder rest. History In 1942 engineer Wac≈Çaw Zawrotny proposed to the Armia Krajowa command that he and his colleagues prepare a project of a cheap, home-made machine pistol for use by the Polish resistance. Its main feature was its simplicity, so that the weapon could be made even in small workshops, by inexperienced engineers. The idea was accepted, and Zawrotny, together with his colleague Seweryn Wielanier, prepared a project of a sub-machine gun, soon afterward named B≈Çyskawica (Polish for \\"lightning\\"). To allow for easier production, all parts of the weapon were joined together with screws and threads rather than bolts and welding, which were commonly used in firearm production ever since the 17th century. The design was based on two of the most popular submachine guns of the era. The external construction with a retractable butt and magazine mounted below the gun was borrowed from the successful German MP 40. The internal design of the mechanism was modeled after the British Sten. Blowback, with an open bolt, it offered good performance and high reliability. Unlike the Sten, and its Polish clone called the Polski Sten, it employed a free-floating firing pin and two springs behind the bolt - one served as the return spring and the other as the buffer spring (similar to the later Sterling submachine gun). The weapon was designed in this fashion so that resistance army members could use any captured stocks of German MP40 ammunition cartridges. The documentation was ready by April 1943, and by September a prototype was ready. After extensive tests in the forests outside of Zielonka near Warsaw, the weapon was presented to the commanding officer of the KeDyw, August Emil Fieldorf, who found the design acceptable. In November the plans were sent to a number of workshops spread throughout occupied Poland and a serial production run was initiated. The name was coined after the three lightning bolts carved on the prototype by its designers, pre-war workers of the Elektrit company that used a similar logo. Polish soldier firing a B≈Çyskawica during the Warsaw Uprising The production started in a workshop officially producing metal fence nets in Warsaw. After the tests of a prototype series of five pistols, the KeDyw ordered 1000, and later an additional 300. Until July 1944 and the start of Operation Tempest roughly 600 pieces were built in Warsaw. During the Warsaw Uprising an additional 40 were built. It is also possible that the B≈Çyskawica was also produced in small quantities outside of Warsaw.

At the Battle of Ravenna in 1512 he commanded the Spanish and Papal infantry, but was captured by the French. In the service of Francis I of France, he would supervise the French crossing of the Alps before the Battle of Novara in 1513. Biography Navarro was probably born at Garde in the Navarrese valley of Roncal. Little is known of his early life. He began his military career in the service of Cardinal Juan de Aragon prior to 1485. He fought against the Barbary pirates in Italy as a Condottiere. Enlisted by Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba in 1499, he took part in the capture and siege of Cephalonia in 1500. He invented the landmine and his skilful employment of mines allowed for the breaching of the walls of the Turkish fortress. He continued in the service of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and went on to Naples, and defended Canosa in 1502 and Taranto in 1503 against the French. He supervised the construction of the field fortifications at the Battle of Cerignola, that enabled Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba to win his battle with Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours on 28 April. He played a major role in the Spanish victory at the Garigliano River on 29 December 1503 and was created count of Oliveto for his services. After returning to Spain in 1507 he took part in the North Africa expeditions of Cardinal Cisneros. Navarro assisted in the capture of the Pe√±√≥n de V√©lez de la Gomera in 1508 by employing a floating battery of his own design during the battle. He went on to fight at the capture of Mazalquivir (Mers-el-K√©bir) and Oran in 1509. Navarro personally led the Spanish forces during the conquest of Bougie (B√©ja√Øa), Algiers, Tunis, Tlemcen, and Tripoli in 1510. He enlisted in the service of Ramon de Cardona viceroy of Naples and returned to Italy upon hearing of a new war against France in 1511. He constructed a number of light carts mounted with light artillery pieces designed to break up enemy formations in 1512. Despite his efforts the Spanish Papal army was defeated, and he was captured by the French, who were under the command of Gaston de Foix, at Ravenna on 11 April 1512). Ferdinand II of Aragon refused to ransom him, and he eventually entered the service of Francis I of France. Navarro went on to accompany the French armies in their campaign against Milan (1515‚Äì1516), and he fought alongside King Francis against the Swiss at the battle of Marignano (September 13‚Äì14, 1515). Continuing in French service, he fought at the Battle of Bicocca (April 27, 1522) and was taken prisoner when the Spanish captured Genoa early the following year (1523). Released after the Treaty of Madrid (January 14, 1526), he returned to French service, again being taken prisoner while serving the French expedition in Italy (1527). He died, aged around 68, in the prison of Castel Nuovo at Naples at the end of August 1528, possibly smothered with a pillow. References * Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and David L. Bongard.

It operates at 930 AM with the current brand name AM930 The Light in Edmonton, Alberta. History It was first licensed in 1922, and it first broadcast on May 1, 1922, becoming Alberta's first radio station. It was an affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission from 1933 to 1936 when it affiliated with the newly formed Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was affiliated to CBC Radio's main Trans-Canada Network until 1962. CJCA was originally owned and operated by the Edmonton Journal, and was later purchased by Selkirk Communications. As of 1994, it broadcasts entirely Christian programming. During the 1960s CJCA was one of two major pop and rock stations in Edmonton (the other being CHED). Walt Rutherford, Phil Floyd, John McKittrick, Murray Blakely, Terry Spense and Earl McKittrick were in the newsroom. Gord Skuttle was the Chief engineer (assisted by Andre Picard). Harry Boon was the Music Director with Dalt Elton as Program Director. The Top 40 was played twice in a row on Saturdays. Dixieland Jazz was played live from a club for an hour on Thursday nights. Each high school had its own \\"fight\\" song for dedications. The DJs were household names, and their pictures were passed out as folding cards. The Top 40 sheet was distributed weekly, and once a month a listener would win the Top 40 records for that week. An FM station was started from the back production studio. The FM simulcast the AM except for 6:00 pm to midnight when CJCA FM played more traditional adult pop music which was handled by an operator who played the records along with the pre- taped announcer. Many \\"Radio 93\\" on-air personalities who went on to bigger markets include singer‚Äìsongwriter Barry Boyd, who had a Canadian hit record, \\"Wishin'\\". In the mid 60s Barry moved to KFXM Radio in San Bernardino, California, which also called itself 'Tiger Radio'. Before returning to Edmonton, Barry was a jock on KCBQ in San Diego. Barry died in Edmonton in 2001. Other famous CJCA DJs included Mike Marshall, who later crossed the street to CHED and then became Frank Brodie at the legendary CKLW in Windsor, Ontario. Jim Hault was a longtime CJCA morning man. Hault later became an on- air institution in Vancouver. On weekdays, George Payne did afternoons; Barry Boyd 4:00‚Äì8:00; Lorne Thompson (who was later an instructor and department head at NAIT) 8:00 to midnight; and Tom Fulton (who came from the Quesnel/Williams Lake station) the A&W; all night show. Fulton came to Toronto's CKFH, then spent his final years at CJRT and AM740. Jim Hand was an extremely popular morning man (prior to Jim Hault) and a real character. The city was shocked when he died at such a young age, a few days after having had dental surgery. A couple of other DJ characters of this era were Frantic Frank Todd (weekends), Don Lamb (weekends and promotions director), and Bernie Bisiup (the all night show - prior to Tom). Because of the station's popularity the DJs spent a lot of time doing remote broadcasts at car dealerships and stores. Ratings-wise, CJCA lead the way for a number of years. Lorne Thompson helped a number young guys get started in radio, including Terry David Mulligan who was then an RCMP Officer patrolling the Edmonton‚ÄìCalgary highway. Doug Thompson, an army brat and still at Queen E high school, started as an operator and later went on to a long career behind the scenes at CHUM in Toronto. Hal Weaver was a very popular CJCA DJ in the mid 60s. A few years later, he would also bring that popularity to CHUM. Bryan Fustukian, broadcasting as Vik Armen, was also associated with CJCA during this period. In the 1970s, a new roster of personalities came to the airwaves, among them Bryan Hall, Bob Arnold, Gord Edlund, Jim Elliot, Dan Jarvis, Mike LeBlanc, Gord Whitehead, and Ryan Grigor. For many years the CJCA broadcast studios were located on the 4th floor of the Birks building in downtown Edmonton. On top of the Birks building was a huge billboard of a tiger wearing sunglasses‚ÄîCJCA was also known as Tiger Radio. CJCA was also home for the Edmonton Eskimos and Edmonton Trappers. Their games were broadcast live on CJCA for many years. In the mid to late 1980s CJCA changed to an \\"all talk\\" format and while it was successful for a short while the station eventually failed and went off the air on December 1, 1993. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the station were purchased by Touch Canada Broadcasting and in April 1994 it returned to the air as a Christian station.

Fourteen different ratnas (gems) were recovered in this exercise, mostly retained by the Deities after the Demons tried to cheat them. But before Amrita could be formed, HalƒÅhala was produced, which started injuring both sides. As no one could bear the lethal fumes emitted by the poison, both Devas and Asuras began to collapse due to asphyxiation. They ran for help to Brahma who refused and advised them that only Shiva could help them. So both parties went to Mount Kailash and prayed to Lord Shiva for help. Shiva chose to consume the poison and thus drank it. His wife, the goddess Parvati, was alarmed, as she gripped her husband's neck with both hands in order to stop the poison, thus earning him the name Vi·π£aka·πá·π≠ha (the one who held poison in his (Shiva's) throat).

The narrative reenacts the last hours of life of the Roman poet Virgil, in the port of Brundisium (Brindisi), whence he had accompanied the emperor Augustus, his decision ‚Äì frustrated by the emperor ‚Äì to burn his Aeneid, and his final reconciliation with his destiny. Virgil's heightened perceptions as he dies recall his life and the age in which he lives. The poet is in the interval between life and death, just as his culture hangs between the pagan and Christian eras. As he reflects, Virgil recognises that history is at a cusp and that he may have falsified reality in his attempt to create beauty. Writing process Broch started to write the novel in 1936, worked on a second version in 1938 ‚Äì to some extent while imprisoned in Bad Aussee for three weeks ‚Äì and finished it in the United States (1940-1945). The stream of consciousness and complex literary allusions in the novel were influenced by the modernist style of James Joyce. The first edition was an English translation by Jean Starr Untermeyer, who is said to have collaborated so closely with Broch as to be almost a co-author. Publication Pantheon Books of New York City published the book in an English translation by Jean Starr Untermeyer in 1945. Pantheon also published an edition in the original German later that year. A German language edition was also published in Z√ºrich by Rhein Verlag in 1947 but the first German publication was not until 1958 when editions were published in Frankfurt and Munich; the latter with colour illustrations by Celestino Piatti. the most recent English language edition of the novel (Penguin, 2000) is out of print, although Vintage Books appears still to offer it in a 1995 reprint, and released it as an ebook on January 12, 2012. Reception Harry Levin comments that \\"Broch's novel creates out of a dying poet a rich, profound vision both of civilization and of primal concerns of all mankind.\\"  Interpretation  Some scholars have interpreted the book as an anti-Nazi novel. Virgil's fear that his writing will only serve to encourage autocratic repression is seen as a direct result of the Nazi Party's interest in and inspiration from classical sources.

Sir Garry Sobers and Jim Laker pronounced him the best leg spinner they had seen. Gupte flighted and spun the ball sharply, and possessed two different googlies. The West Indians who toured India in 1958/9 reckoned that Gupte could turn the ball on glass. His only drawback perhaps was that he tended to lose confidence when the batsmen attacked his bowling. In the domestic arena, Gupte played for Bengal, Bombay and Rajasthan in India and for Rishton, Heywood and Lancaster in the UK. Career Gupte made his debut in 1951‚Äì52 and from the next season onward took over from Vinoo Mankad as India's leading spinner. He was nicknamed after the West Indian leg spinner Wilfred Ferguson. Gupte took 27 wickets in West Indies in 1952‚Äì53. At Kanpur in 1958‚Äì59, he took nine West Indian wickets in an innings for 102 runs, and had Lance Gibbs ‚Äì the only batsman he missed ‚Äì dropped by wicket keeper Naren Tamhane. In December 1954, while playing for Bombay against Pakistan Combined Services and Bahawalpur XI, he picked all ten wickets in an innings, returning figures of 10/78. In the process, he became the first Indian to take a ten-wicket haul in first-class cricket. He had a successful tour of Pakistan in 1954‚Äì55 claiming 21 wickets in the five-Test series. Gupte became the second bowler after Vinoo Mankad to claim 100 Test wickets for India when he dismissed Rohan Kanhai in the Second Test of West Indies' 1958‚Äì59 tour of India. He picked 34 wickets in four Tests, as many as the combined total of all other bowlers, during New Zealand's 1955‚Äì56 India tour. He played his final Test series in Pakistan's 1960‚Äì61 tour of India when he appeared in first three Tests and claimed eight wickets. In August 1955, Gupte picked up his second ten-wicket haul in an innings (10/101), playing for Rishton in the final of the Lancashire League Worsley Cup against Todmorden. In June 1956, while playing against Accrington in the Lancashire League, he claimed two hat-tricks in one innings returning figures of 8/19 in 7.3 overs. = Career-ending controversy = Gupte's international career ended under controversial circumstances during England's 1961‚Äì62 tour of India. During the Third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, the team stayed at the Imperial hotel, where Gupte was housed in room number 7 along with teammate A. G. Kripal Singh. During the stay, a receptionist at the hotel lodged a complaint with the India team manager against inmates of that room accusing them of calling her over after her shift finished. The pair denied the allegation, with Gupte, who was married at the time, explaining that Singh had merely called and asked for drinks to be brought up. The matter was taken up by the authorities seriously before both were suspended from the team. Gupte later recollected that, M. A. Chidambaram, the President of the BCCI during the time, did not give him a hearing in Calcutta, the venue of the Fourth Test, as promised. The hearing was eventually held in Madras where the selectors and the BCCI met to pick the squad for the tour of the Caribbean. Gupte was reprimanded by the BCCI secretary A. N. Ghosh for having not stopped Singh from making the call, to which he replied, \\"He is a big man. How can I stop him?\\". Both players were dropped from the squad for the tour and Gupte never played for India again. Gupte's 36-match Test career ended with 149 wickets at an average of 29.55. In 1981/82, a benefit match was held for Gupte in Sharjah. In 2002, he named Australia's Neil Harvey as the \\"toughest batsman\\" he had bowled to. Personal life Gupte's brother Baloo was also a leg spinner who played for India. Gupte met Carol at an official function during his successful 1952‚Äì53 tour of the Caribbean with India, which he finished claiming 50 first-class wickets. They married in the late 1950s and following his suspension from the side, he moved to Trinidad where his finished his career as a cricketer in 1964. They had a son named Anilhttp://www.guardian.co.tt/article/an-indian-cricket-stars-trini-love- story-6.2.824226.7d12a73352, and daughter named Carolyn.

He served as bishop and then the first archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, Iowa from 1866‚Äì1900. Biography =Early life and education= John Hennessy was born August 20, 1825 in Bulgaden, County Limerick, Ireland. He was the oldest of twelve children born to William and Mary (Meaney) Hennessy. He studied for the priesthood initially at All Hallows College, Dublin then at St. Vincent's Seminary in Cape Girardeau, Missouri and Carondelet Seminary near St. Louis. =Ordination and ministry= He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Saint Louis on November 1, 1850. Father Hennessy was assigned to parish work in New Madrid, Missouri and then St. Peter's in Gravois. He then served as a seminary professor and then president at Carondelet, and in 1858 he was sent to the Holy See as a representative of Archbishop Kenrick. From 1860 to 1866 he was a pastor of St. Joseph's Church in St. Joseph, Missouri.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05179b.htm =Bishop and Archbishop of Dubuque, Iowa= On April 24, 1866 Pope Pius IX appointed Hennessy as the third bishop of Dubuque. He was consecrated and installed bishop in St. Raphael's Cathedral on September 30, 1866 by Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick of Saint Louis. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops John Martin Henni of Milwaukee and James Duggan of Chicago. Bishop Hennessy attended the First Vatican Council in Rome from 1869‚Äì70. He also took a prominent role in the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884. When Hennessy became bishop, the territory of the diocese encompassed the entire state of Iowa. He became convinced, as had Bishop Smyth before him, that the diocese should be divided in two. Archbishop Kenrick and the other bishops of the province advocated splitting Iowa into two with a diocese in the east (Dubuque) and one in the west (Council Bluffs). Others, including the Revs. J.A.M. Pelamourgues and Andrew Trevis, envisioned a new See with Davenport as its headquarters. On May 8, 1881 Pope Leo XIII established the new Diocese of Davenport. Davenport was chosen because of the income the new bishop would receive from the commercial properties owned by the church on Church Square (St. Anthony's Church) in Davenport.Svendsen, Marls A., Davenport: where the Mississippi Runs west A Survey of Davenport History & Architecture (Davenport: City of Davenport, 1982) 11-2. The Dubuque Diocese now covered roughly the northern half of Iowa. An advocate of Catholic education, Hennessy had schools and convents established in all of the large cities in Iowa. He founded St. Joseph's College (now Loras College) in Dubuque on September 8, 1873.Hennessey, John Encyclopedia Dubuque Some Catholics in the diocese opposed the expansion of Catholic schools for economic reasons, and because they felt it was an attack on public school education. During his tenure as bishop and archbishop, Hennessy oversaw the expansion of the diocese even though this was a period of anti-Catholic sentiments in Dubuque and across the United States. When he arrived in Dubuque, there were 27 priests, 30 churches, two schools and seven sisters. By 1891 there were 203 priests, 319 churches, 615 sisters, and over 135 parochial schools with 16,257 students. This was after the diocese had lost almost half of its territory ten years before. On June 15, 1893, Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Dubuque to the status of an archdiocese, and Bishop Hennessy became the first Archbishop of Dubuque. The Ecclesial Province of Dubuque included the dioceses of Davenport, Omaha, Wichita and Sioux Falls. Archbishop Hennessy died in Dubuque on March 4, 1900. He was a man of some means for his time as he left an estate of $700,000. It was divided among several Catholic charities. In the last years of his life, Hennessy requested that a mortuary chapel be built in St. Raphael's Cathedral. This new chapel was built in the basement of the cathedral and completed two years after his death. The remains of Bishop's Mathias Loras, Clement Smyth, and Hennessy were brought to the cathedral and buried in this new chapel. Legacy Archbishop Hennessy is one of the more prominent figures in the history of the archdiocese, as the latter half of the 19th century was a period of growth for the archdiocese, and as he also served as the leader of the archdiocese for over 30 years. Loras College honored Hennessy by naming one of its buildings after him. A stained glass window in St. Joseph Church in Sioux City, Iowa contains a portrait of Archbishop Hennessy. His episcopal coat of arms is in the stained glass window above the east side entrance to St. Mary's Church in Iowa City, Iowa, which he dedicated in 1869.

They released three albums, Peril (1993), Multiverse (1994) and Astro (1996).  History  Peril were founded in Melbourne by Tony Buck on drums, samples and machine (also in the Necks) and they were active from 1992 to 1996. Their music was mostly improvised with Buck's drum-triggered samples providing a complex rhythmic base, over this is the turntablism and guitar of Otomo Yoshihide (also in Ground Zero (band)) and other rock improvised elements from Michael Sheridan on guitar (ex-No) and Kato Hideki (bass guitar, vocals) from Japan. In 2006 Buck listed ten of his most influential albums, including The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste (November 1989) by Ministry, which he described as \\"The sound, power, great mix of sampling and big guitars, space, simplicity, beats...I couldn't get enough of it for quite sometime. The influence of this band played a big part in some of the sounds I was going for in my band Peril I think.\\" Peril performed at the Sydney Sesquicentenary Jazz Festival in February 1992. The group recorded and performed internationally throughout Europe and Asia. Their debut, self-titled album was released via the local label, Dr Jim's Records, in 1993. It had been recorded partly in Melbourne and in Tokyo. > \\"The music was the most extreme collage of styles and textures that I've > ever been gloriously immersed in. The depth to which sounds were crossed > made Zorn's Naked City sound like a mere pit band.\\"‚Äì Michael Sheridan A second album, Multiverse, was recorded in the Netherlands between July and October 1993, and released in 1994 via Invisible / SF Records (Sound Factory) ‚Äì the latter label is from Hong Kong. Buck and the group had relocated to the Netherlands where Hideki was replaced by Melbourne-born Thierry Fossemalle on bass guitar, for that album. Fran√ßois Couture of AllMusic described how Multiverse \\"pushes the trio's art further into aural assault while retaining a wild funk-rock basis.\\" In early 1994 Buck, Sheridan and Yoshihide were members of the Chaotic Violin, alongside Chris Abrahams (of the Necks) and Jon Rose, which performed at the Harbourside Brasserie in Sydney where Peril also appeared. The group's third album, Astro, was released in 1996 via Red Note, with Buck producing. By that time they had relocated to Berlin where they disbanded during that year. Buck formed a group, Glacial, and also worked on experimental music. Sheridan issued his solo album, Digital Jamming, in 1996. Yoshihide continued with Ground Zero and his solo work. Fossemalle was later in Ute and from 1999 lives in Byron Bay.

Licensed to Porterville, California, United States, the station serves the Visalia-Tulare area. The station was owned by Mayberry Broadcasting Company, Inc. and did feature programming from Fox News Radio, Premiere Radio Networks and Salem Communications. History KTIP became one of the first radio stations in the West to sign on after World War II. Its construction permit was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in August 1946, to Porterville businessman Jack Tighe (pronounced \\"tie\\"). He owned Tighe Chevrolet Company and an appliance store. Construction of the station was completed by Christmas, 1946. Its exact sign-on date is not known, but the station was notified by the FCC's San Francisco office in January 1947 for failure to issue a proper station identification during one hour of programming that month, so it has been concluded that KTIP was \\"on the air\\" in January 1947. KTIP signed on with a full-time power of 250 watts. KTIP was featured in a Life magazine article in its March 24, 1947 issue. The subhead declared, \\"Local news and interviews help KTIP compete with big networks in a small California town.\\" The ten photos accompanying the article helped profile a town of 6,827 people with a smog-free view of the Sierra Nevada. Tighe's ownership of the station ended in 1954, when he sold the station to a Miller from the midwest. According to subsequent owner Larry Cotta, Miller owned the station for a very short time. Cotta recalls Miller turned the station's revenues into the black and used the profits to pay off debts he had incurred from station ownership in the midwest. That done, Miller quickly sold KTIP to Gary Garland and Larry Cotta. In 1978, Garland and Cotta sold the station to Monte Moore and his friend Frank Haas. It was during the Moore ownership that KTIP took on the persona of its owner like few other Radio stations in history. Moore was a play-by-play broadcaster for the Oakland A's baseball team, beginning when the A's were a Kansas City team in 1962. He also did the NBC television game of the week in the 1970s.

Biography Alfonso d'Este, by Dosso Dossi Anna Maria Sforza Lucrezia Borgia, 1518 alt= He was the son of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and Eleanor of Naples and became duke on Ercole's death in January 1505. In the first year of his rule he uncovered a plot by his brother Ferrante and half-brother Giulio d'Este, directed against him and his other brother Ippolito. In September 1506 a trial for l√®se majest√© and high treason was held and, as expected, the death sentence was passed, but just as Ferrante and Giulio were about to mount the gallows they were informed that the duke had commuted their sentence to life imprisonment. They were led away to two cells in the Torre dei Leoni. Ferrante died in his cell after 34 years of imprisonment, while Giulio held on until he was pardoned in 1559, after 53 years of imprisonment. After his release, Giulio was ridiculed in the streets of Ferrara for his outdated clothes and died in 1561. In the Italian Wars Alfonso preserved his precarious position among the contending powers by flexibility and vigilance and the unrivalled fortifications of Ferrara; he entered the League of Cambrai against Venice and remained an ally of Louis XII of France even after Pope Julius II had made peace with Venice; when the Bolognesi rebelled against Julius and toppled Michelangelo's bronze statue of the Pope from above the gate, Alfonso received the shards and recast them as a cannon named La Giulia, which he set on the ramparts of the castello: in 1510 Julius excommunicated him and declared his fiefs forfeit, thereby adding Ferrara to the Papal States; Alfonso then fought successfully against the Venetian and Papal armies, gaining the Battle of Polesella, capturing Bologna, and playing a major part in the French victory at the Battle of Ravenna (1512). These successes were based on Ferrara's artillery, produced in his own foundry, which was the best of its time. In both of his portraits by Titian, (Compare illustration above) he poses with his arm across the mouth of one of his cannon. In 1526‚Äì1527 Alfonso participated in the expedition of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, against Pope Clement VII, and in 1530 the pope again recognized him as possessor of the forfeited duchies of Modena and Reggio. Marriages In January 1491, Alfonso was married to Anna Sforza, the niece of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. In the same ceremony, Ludovico was married to Alfonso's younger sister, Beatrice d'Este, in a double wedding orchestrated by Leonardo da Vinci. Politically, the wedding was designed to cement ties between the two families. Anna Sforza's death, on 30 November 1497, marked the end of those ties, as Beatrice d'Este had died in January of that same year. Alfonso later remarried, to Lucrezia Borgia, in 1502. After Lucrezia's death on 24 June 1519, he married Laura Dianti by whom he had an illegitimate son, Alfonso d'Este (later legitimized). Art Aeneas and Achates on the Libyan shore, painted by Dosso Dossi for Alfonso's camerino d'alabastro (National Gallery of Art, Washington). Like his brother Ippolito I, Cardinal d'Este, he was one of the great patrons of art of his time: for him the elderly Giovanni Bellini painted The Feast of the Gods in 1514, Bellini's last completed painting. He turned to Bellini's pupil, Titian, for a sequence of paintings. In 1529 Alfonso created the most magnificent gallery of his time, his studiolo or camerino d'alabastro (\\"small alabaster room\\"), now usually known as his \\"Camerino\\", in order to better display his works of art against white marble-veneered walls under a gilded ceiling. The pallor of the marble led to the name of this room as the chamber of alabaster. There are documents from Mario Equicola on 9 October 1511, noting plans for painting of a room in Ferrara, in which six fables (fabule) or histories (istorie) shall be placed. I have already found them and have presented them in writing.\\" A letter from Alfonso, dated 14 November 1514, authorized payment to Giovanni Bellini, the first painting completed for the chamber. Titian is known to have painted two portraits of Alfonso: the first was widely acclaimed, singled out by Michelangelo and coerced as a diplomatic gift by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; Alfonso induced Titian to paint a free replica, which the artist of the painting illustrated above has adapted for his model.Bryson Burroughs, \\"The Portrait of Alfonso d'Este by Titian\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 22.4 (April 1927), pp. 97‚Äì101. Over the next two decades, Titian added three more paintings: The Worship of Venus (Museo del Prado, Madrid), The Bacchanal of the Andrians (Prado, Madrid), and Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London). Dosso Dossi produced another large bacchanal, and he also contributed ceiling decorations and a painted frieze for the cornice, depicting scenes from the Aeneid, which gained immediacy by showing the heroes in contemporary dress (illustration, left). All the bacchanals in the Alabaster Chamber dealt with love, and some refer to marriage. After the Este family lost control of Ferrara in 1598, the Alabaster Chamber's paintings and sculpture were dispersed. Alfonso inherited from Cardinal d'Este the poet Ariosto. Following in the lead of his father Ercole, who had made Ferrara into one of the musical centers of Europe, Alfonso brought some of the most famous musicians of the time to his court to work as composers, instrumentalists and singers. Musicians from northern Europe who worked at Ferrara during his reign included Antoine Brumel and Adrian Willaert, the latter of whom was to become the founder of the Venetian School, something which could not have happened without Alfonso's patronage. History When Alfonso's grandson Alfonso II d'Este‚ÄîRobert Browning's duke of \\"My Last Duchess\\"‚Äîproduced no male heir, the main d'Este line died out. A grandson of Alfonso I and cousin of Alfonso II, Cesare d'Este had been born out of wedlock. He was recognized by the Emperor but not by the Pope, who took the Duchy of Ferrara by force. Nevertheless, the House of Este continued in Modena and Reggio. Ancestors See also *House of Este *Italian Wars References Bibliography * Taylor, Frederick Lewis (1973).

History In 1952, Western Reserve University established the School of Business by combining the Cleveland College Division of Business Administration and the Graduate School Division of Business Administration. From its founding until 1988, the activities of the School of Business were divided among a number of buildings in downtown Cleveland and in University Circle. In 1967, the merger of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University created Case Western Reserve University, and the Western Reserve University School of Business absorbed Case‚Äôs Division of Organizational Sciences to become the School of Management in 1970. In 1976, the school launched its first full-time MBA. In 1980, the School of Management was renamed in honor of Albert J. Weatherhead, III, a Cleveland businessman and industrialist, following his $3 million gift to the school. In 1988, space on the Case Quad within what is now known as Nord Hall, then Enterprise Hall, was specially converted to house the growing Business Management program. This was made possible by funding from five leading Cleveland companies: Ohio Mattress, Nesco, Premier Industries, Parker Hannifin, and Keithley Instruments. In 2002 the new Peter B. Lewis Building was completed to house the management school. It was designed by internationally known architect Frank Gehry. The School of Management has about 1,700 students annually. Campus The main entrance of the Peter B. Lewis Building Weatherhead School of Management is a school of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), a research university in Cleveland, Ohio. Weatherhead's degree programs are housed in the Peter B. Lewis Building with the school's Executive Education programs housed in the George S. Dively Building. The CWRU campus is located in Cleveland‚Äôs University Circle, a square mile urban district of cultural, medical, educational, religious and social service institutions. University Circle houses multiple cultural institutions including, the Cleveland Orchestra, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland's Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), and Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Weatherhead borders Cleveland's newest development district, Uptown, an arts and entertainment district. The Peter B. Lewis Building, designed by Frank Gehry and completed in 2002, has an area of approximately and stands five stories tall. It is named after Cleveland philanthropist Peter B. Lewis, who donated $36.9 million towards its construction. The building's decentralized design was chosen so that, ‚ÄúFaculty offices, classrooms and meeting areas are distributed on every floor to encourage informal interaction and complement the Weatherhead School‚Äôs learner-centered curricula.‚Äù The Fowler Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit The Fowler Center was launched on June 24, 2004‚Äîthe same day that Weatherhead faculty and students facilitated the United Nations Leaders Summit with the UN Secretary General and 500 CEOs from many of the world‚Äôs largest corporations. Through research, education, and advanced projects with industry leaders and policy makers, the Center was created to advance extraordinary business and society innovation, helping to revolutionize the ways business will eradicate poverty, replenish and restore nature, and build foundations for peace through commerce. Much of the Center‚Äôs effort in all three action domains ‚Äì research, pedagogy, and outreach ‚Äì were manifested in 2006 at the Global Forum for Business as an Agent of World Benefit convened by the Case Weatherhead School of Management, the Academy of Management, and the United Nations Global Compact. The Forum attracted more than 400 leading scholars and business leaders from 40 countries; another 600 participated virtually. The Center created new partners for the school, including Toyota, Coca-Cola, Novartis, Lafarge, Sherwin-Williams, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and others.*Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit *An Interview with Judy Rogers at Pegasus Communications, Inc online *An Interview with David Cooperrider, Director of the Center *The Taos Institute article on the Center *The New School Milano's mention of the Center Academic programs =Undergraduate= Weatherhead offers traditional four-year programs in the following areas: *BS in Accounting - For students pursuing the BS in accounting, integrated study options enable attainment of a Master's of Accountancy degree in five years or less, satisfying the 150-hour requirement to sit for the CPA examination in most states. *BS in Management (with majors in either Finance or Marketing) *BA in Economics All students in the undergraduate program are able to pursue minors in accounting, economics, entrepreneurship, finance, leadership, or marketing.

People =Faculty= Prominent faculty include David Cooperrider, Fred Collopy, Dick Boland and Richard Buchanan. Boland and Collopy are widely published leaders in the emerging 'design thinking' trend. In addition to numerous articles, Collopy and Boland authored the book \\"Managing as Designing\\" about the experience of working with Frank Gehry and how this experience helped shape the design thinking trend. With the help of Richard Buchanan, The Weatherehad School of Management's lead role in the trend was recognized by BusinessWeek in September, 2009 as one of the top 30 Design Thinking programs in the world. Their 'Manage By Designing' initiative helped launch the Weatherhead Collection and the rest of the school's much- praised rebranding effort that is notable for having pioneered the use of high-design aesthetics instead of the traditionally conservative approach historically taken by business schools.

Until this time, launch vehicles such as the Pegasus rocket, or rocket planes such as the X-1, X-15, or SpaceShipOne, which were carried under an aircraft pointing in the same direction as the fuselage, would have their engines ignited either just before being air-dropped or a few seconds afterward. They would then be expected to accelerate and climb in front of the carrier aircraft, crossing its flight path. This was considered dangerous due to the potential for a crashes between the rocket and the launch vehicle. The aft-crossing trajectory is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rocket's rotation (induced by the deployment from the aircraft) is slowed by a small parachute attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it. It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. The principal advantage of this method is its safety for the crew of the carrier aircraft.

In some cases where an attendance list was part of the minutes, decisions were made when the board did not have quorum.

It was produced by Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd, and its mechanics were the first iteration of the Cortex System. It won an Origins Award for best RPG in 2005Serenity RPG entry on RPG Geek and Margaret Weis' license came to an end on January 31, 2011.Tenkar's Tavern In February 2013, Margaret Weis Productions announced they now had a license to produce a game based on the Firefly TV series, this time with the rights to the characters who appeared in the series rather than those who appeared in the film.Board Game Geek copy of the press release At Gencon 2013, a preview of the system entitled Gamin' In The Verse was offered for sale both at GenCon and for a limited time as a PDF.RPG Now review In 2014, the Firefly Role-Playing Game was released, followed by four game supplements in 2014 and 2015. Contents The book is in full color and also includes biographies of the characters, in the words of Mal, and statistics of the crew. Each chapter opens with a narrative to give the mood and feeling of the setting. These narratives alternate between a crew created by MWP and the crew of 'Serenity'. There are many photographs used as illustration throughout the book, but all are sampled from the film Serenity as opposed to the show Firefly. This is due to MWP acquiring their rights from Universal Studios rather than 20th Century Fox. For this reason as well, the previously mentioned narrative text may come close to something that happened in an episode of Firefly but will diverge in some way to stay within the license purchased through Universal. The first chapter introduces the character and setting, giving a brief history of \\"The Verse\\" and the basic concepts of play. The next few chapters deal with character creation as well as details on Attributes, Skills, and Traits. Following the character creation chapters are chapters on more detailed play systems, additional setting information, equipment, and running the game, including profiles for many pre-generated non-player characters, a sample crew other than the crew of 'Serenity', several sample ships, and stats for some of the secondary cast of the film. At the end of the book there is an appendix which goes over Chinese as it is used in the setting and a short primer for those who want to insert it into their games. =Related products= * Out in the Black by Laura and Tracy Hickman, the system's first adventure, was released on 2006-03-15.

It is a rules light generic roll-over system using polyhedral dice. Each of a character's attributes and skills is assigned one of these dice types, with larger dice representing greater ability, ranging from d4 to d12+d4. When a character attempts an action, such as piloting a spacecraft, shooting a gun, or punching someone, the player rolls the die for the character's applicable attribute and the die for their appropriate skill, adds the results together, and compares the total against a difficulty number based on the difficulty of the task being attempted The Firefly Role-Playing Game was produced under the Cortex Plus system, and the dice pool includes three basic sections; an attribute (Physical/Mental/Social, either one at d6, one at d8, and one at d10 or all three at d8), a skill, and a distinction chosen from a list that may be rolled at d8 or rolled at d4 to gain a plot point. Each distinction comes with two possible traits, and starting characters pick two out of the possible six. Further there may be an asset used (signature assets start at d8) or a complication on the other party. Take the two highest for task resolution.Geek Native interview Reception Serenity won the 2005 Origins Award for the Gamer‚Äôs Choice Best Role Playing Game of the Year.

It was directed by Jack Smight and stars Paul Newman. Plot Several brigadier generals (American, British, and French) are unexpectedly taken prisoner by the Italians while arguing military tactics in a sauna, which is a public relations disaster. They are held in an Italian villa run as a top-level prison camp by the benevolent Colonel Ferrucci. Being all of the same rank, none is in command and they are forced to plan escapes by committee, with predictably ineffective results. Headquarters devises a plot to free them by sending in Harry Frigg (Paul Newman). Frigg is a private in the U.S. Army who has a history of escaping from military stockades; he is usually put inside them as he does not want to be a private in the army. As an incentive, he is promised a promotion to sergeant after the generals have been freed. Accepting the mission, Frigg is promoted to major general so that he will outrank all the prisoners, assume command and lead the resultant breakout. Parachuted behind enemy lines, Frigg allows himself to be captured, and is imprisoned in the same jail as are the brigadiers. While they are initially skeptical of Frigg's rank, he has been given a few personal secrets about them that only a senior officer might be expected to know. Frigg discovers a secret passage from his bedroom to the gatehouse outside the villa's fence, which he intends to use to escape with the other generals. However, Frigg's plan is put on hold when he becomes romantically involved with Countess Francesca De Montefiore (Sylva Koscina), the owner of the castle where the men are imprisoned. Eventually, the escape plan is reactivated. On the eve of the group's intended escape, Colonel Ferrucci announces that because of the low escape rate in the complex, he is to be promoted to general at midnight the following night. The group decides to put their escape plans off by a day to ensure the Colonel gets promoted to general at least once, despite knowing that his rank will be stripped once they do escape. During the celebration, a Nazi major arrives, and after midnight he announces that Italy has surrendered to Germany, and all present are now his prisoners. The Germans take the generals to a high- security prison camp for officers. Escape seems hopeless; however, Frigg confesses to being only a private, and is separated from the rest to be delivered to a basic holding camp for NCOs. Escaping his guard, he then breaks back into the officers' camp, eventually freeing them all and capturing the Major in the process. The film concludes with Frigg ending the war as a master sergeant who is offered the charge of a radio station and a promotion to second lieutenant. Whilst discussing the role, Frigg passes the countess' castle and decides to use it as the base of the radio station. Cast *Paul Newman as Private/Major General/Sergeant/2nd Lt.

Dr. Leduc was the only French Canadian member of Parliament to support Mackenzie King's Conscription bill during World War II, a stance which was highly unpopular but which reflected his deep belief in the Canadian federalist system. An avid fisherman and hunter, Dr. Leduc established a popular tourist camp on 31 Mile Lake near Maniwaki, Quebec. Dr. Leduc won several Arizona state shuffleboard championships during his winter retirement there. Dr. and Mrs. Leduc had 6 children: Jeannine, Pauline, Bernard, Fernand, Lise and Renee.

Thind enlisted in the United States Army a few months before the end of World War I. After the war he sought to become a naturalized citizen, following a legal ruling that Caucasians had access to such rights. In 1923, the Supreme Court ruled against him in the case United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, which retroactively denied all Indian Americans the right to obtain United States citizenship for failing to meet the definition of a \\"white person\\", \\"person of African descent\\", or \\"alien of African nativity\\". Thind remained in the United States, earned his PhD in theology and English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, and delivered lectures on metaphysics. His lectures were based on Sikh religious philosophy, but included references to the scriptures of other world religions and the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Henry David Thoreau. He campaigned for Indian independence from the British Empire. In 1936, Thind applied successfully for United States citizenship through the State of New York. Early life Thind was born on October 3, 1892, in the village of Taragarh Talawa of Amritsar district in the state of Punjab in India,http://pbplanning.gov.in/districts/Jandiala.pdf listed as number 68 in this record. He belonged to the Thind clan of Kamboj. Arrival in the United States Bhagat Singh Thind arrived in the United States in 1913 to pursue higher education at an American university. On July 22, 1918, he was recruited by the United States Army to fight in World War I, and on November 8, 1918, he was promoted to the rank of Acting Sergeant. He received an honorable discharge on December 16, 1918, with his character designated as \\"excellent\\".Rashmi Sharma Singh: Petition for citizenship filed on September 27, 1935, State of New York. U.S. citizenship conferred many rights and privileges, but only \\"free white men\\" and \\"persons of African nativity or persons of African descent\\" could be naturalized. In the United States at this time, many anthropologists used the term Caucasian as a synonym for white. Indians were also categorized as Caucasians by various anthropologists. Thus, several Indians were granted United States citizenship in different U.S. states. Thind also applied for citizenship from the State of Washington in July 1918. First United States citizenship Bhagat Singh Thind with his battalion at Camp Lewis, Washington on November 18, 1918. Thind received his certificate of US citizenship on December 9, 1918, wearing military uniform as he was still serving in the United States Army. However, the Bureau of Naturalization did not agree with the decision of the district court to grant Thind citizenship. Thind's nationality was referred to as \\"Hindoo\\" or \\"Hindu\\" in all legal documents and in the news media despite being a practicing Sikh. At that time, Indians in the United States and Canada were called Hindus regardless of their religion. Thind's citizenship was revoked four days later, on December 13, 1918, on the grounds that Thind was not a \\"white man\\". Second United States citizenship Thind applied for United States citizenship again from the neighboring State of Oregon, on May 6, 1919. The same Bureau of Naturalization official who revoked Thind‚Äôs citizenship tried to convince the judge to refuse citizenship to Thind, accusing Thind of involvement in the Ghadar Party, which campaigned for Indian independence from the British Empire.Doug Coulson, Race, Nation, and Refuge: The Rhetoric of Race in Asian American Citizenship Cases (Albany: SUNY Press, 2017). Judge Charles E. Wolverton wrote that Thind \\"stoutly denies that he was in any way connected with the alleged propaganda of the Gadar Press to violate the neutrality laws of this country, or that he was in sympathy with such a course. He frankly admits, nevertheless, that he is an advocate of the principle of India for the Indians, and would like to see India rid of British rule, but not that he favors an armed revolution for the accomplishment of this purpose.\\" The judge took all arguments and Thind‚Äôs military record into consideration and declined to agree with the Bureau of Naturalization. Thus, Thind received United States citizenship for the second time on November 18, 1920. Supreme Court appeal The Bureau of Naturalization appealed against the judge‚Äôs decision to the next higher court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case to the Supreme Court for ruling on the following two questions: # \\"Is a high caste Hindu of full Indian blood, born at Amritsar, Punjab, India, a white person within the meaning of section 2169, Revised Statutes?\\" # \\"Does the act of February 5, 1917 (39 Stat. L. 875, section 3) disqualify from naturalization as citizens those Hindus, now barred by that act, who had lawfully entered the United States prior to the passage of said act?\\" Section 2169, Revised Statutes, provides that the provisions of the Naturalization Act \\"shall apply to aliens, being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\\" In preparing briefs for the Ninth Circuit Court, Thind's attorney, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, argued that the Immigration Act of 1917 barred new immigrants from India but did not deny citizenship to Indians who, like Thind, were legally admitted before the passage of the new law. The purpose of the Immigration Act was \\"prospective, and not retroactive.\\" On February 19, 1923, Justice George Sutherland delivered the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court to deny citizenship to Indians, stating that \\"a negative answer must be given to the first question, which disposes of the case and renders an answer to the second question unnecessary, and it will be so certified.\\" The justices wrote that since the \\"common man's\\" definition of \\"white\\" did not include Indians, they could not be naturalized. Thind's citizenship was revoked and the Bureau of Naturalization issued a certificate in 1926 canceling his citizenship a second time. The Bureau of Naturalization also initiated proceedings to revoke citizenship granted to other Indian Americans. Between 1923 and 1926, the citizenship of fifty Indians was taken away. Third and final United States citizenship Thind petitioned for naturalization a third time through the state of New York in 1935 after the Congress passed the Nye-Lea Act, which made World War I veterans eligible for naturalization regardless of race. Based on his status as a veteran of the United States military during World War I, he was finally granted United States citizenship nearly two decades after he first petitioned for naturalization.

Thind learned about American culture from students and teachers at the University of California, Berkeley, and from working people in the lumber mills of Oregon and Washington, where he worked during summer vacations to support himself financially. His teachings incorporated the scriptures of many religions, including Sikhism. During his lectures to Christian audiences, he frequently quoted the Vedas, Guru Nanak, Kabir, and other sources in Indian philosophy. He also made reference to the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Henry David Thoreau. Thind earned a PhD, became a writer, and was respected as a spiritual guide. He gave a new \\"vista of awareness\\" to his students throughout the United States and was able to initiate \\"thousands of disciples\\" into his expanded view of reality ‚Äì \\"the Inner Life, and the discovery of the power of the Holy N√£m.\\" He published many pamphlets and books, including Radiant Road to Reality, Science of Union with God, The Pearl of Greatest Price, House of Happiness, Jesus, The Christ: In the Light of Spiritual Science (Vol. I, II, III), The Enlightened Life, Tested Universal Science of Individual Meditation in Sikh Religion, and Divine Wisdom. Death Thind was writing a book when he died on September 15, 1967. He was outlived by his wife, Vivian, whom he had married in March 1940, and his daughter Tara and son David. His son created a website to propagate the philosophy for which his father devoted himself to the United States. He also posthumously published two of his father's books: Troubled Mind in a Torturing World and their Conquest and Winners and Whiners in this Whirling World.

He served in the United States Senate during the American Civil War. Pomeroy also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. A Republican, he also was the mayor of Atchison, Kansas, from 1858 to 1859, the second president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, and the first president to oversee any of the railroad's construction and operations. Pomeroy succeeded Cyrus K. Holliday as president of the railroad on January 13, 1864. Career =Early life= Samuel C. Pomeroy was born on January 3, 1816 at Southampton, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College. Pomeroy opposed the politics of slavery, and in 1854 he became an affiliate of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. That fall, he led a group of settlers to Kansas to help found the city of Lawrence. =1860s= On April 4, 1861, the Kansas legislature elected Pomeroy (along with James Lane) to be one of Kansas's first federal senators. In 1863, during the Civil War, Pomeroy escorted Frederick Douglass to the War Department building to meet War Secretary Edwin Stanton. Afterwards, Douglass attended a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln. In 1864, Pomeroy was the chair of a committee supporting Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase for the Republican nomination for President of the United States over the incumbent, Abraham Lincoln. Pomeroy also spoke in support of Chase's candidacy in the Senate.Congressional Globe. 38th Cong., 1st sess. 10 March 1864. 1025-27. The Pomeroy committee issued a confidential circular to leading Republicans in February 1864 attacking Lincoln, which had the unintended effect of galvanizing support for Lincoln and seriously damaging Chase's prospects. =1870s= On December 18, 1871, at the urging of Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and after learning of the findings of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871, Pomeroy introduced the Act of Dedication bill into the Senate that ultimately led to the creation of Yellowstone National Park. =1880s= During the 1880 presidential election Pomeroy was John W. Phelps' running mate on the revived Anti-Masonic Party. Bribery charges During the Kansas senatorial election of 1873, it was alleged that Senator Pomeroy paid $7,000 to Mr. Alexander M. York, a Kansas state senator, to secure his vote for reelection to the Senate by the Kansas State Legislature.Senate Journal. 42nd Cong., 3rd sess. 1214‚Äì1215. York publicly disclosed the alleged bribe was an attempt to pin a bribery charge against the senator. Pomeroy ultimately lost the election to John J. Ingalls. State Senator York was also one of the brothers of Dr. William York, one of the murder victims of the Bloody Benders Family. Pomeroy took to the Senate floor on February 10, 1873 to deny the allegations as a \\"conspiracy ... for the purpose of accomplishing my defeat,\\" and urged the creation of a special committee to investigate the allegations. The payment of the $7,000 was never disputed by witnesses, but instead of being a bribe it was described to the committee as a payment meant to be passed along to a second individual as seed money to start a national bank.Senate Journal. 42nd Cong., 3rd sess. 3 March 1873. 2161. The Special Committee on the Kansas Senatorial Election issued its report on March 3, 1873, which determined there was insufficient evidence to sustain the bribery charge, and instead was part of a \\"concerted plot\\" to defeat Senator Pomeroy. Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio disagreed with the special committee's findings, stating his belief in Pomeroy's guilt and calling attempts to explain the payment as something other than a bribe as \\"so improbable, especially in view of the circumstances attending the senatorial election, that reliance cannot be placed upon them.\\" However, Thurman chose not to pursue the matter further, as March 3 coincided with Senator Pomeroy's last day in office. This whole matter was alluded to in detail in the satire The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, in which the prominent character Senator Dillworth is based on Pomeroy.\\"Afterword\\" by Greg Camfield to the Oxford University Press edition of The Gilded Age, p.15.

After high school, Smith enrolled at Cleveland State University where he studied Marketing and Business Management. During his time as a student he played baseball for the CSU Vikings, pitching for their NCAA team.  Career  Rick Smith Jr.‚Äôs career unofficially began during the second half of his time at CSU when he realized that his ability in card throwing could help him break world records and move quickly into the spotlight. After throwing a card at a friend in jest and accidentally slicing his arm, it became clear that Smith possessed an unusual talent for the sport. In the days and weeks that followed, he alerted the local press that he would be attempting to break the record for distance of a playing card throw in CSU‚Äôs Wolstein Center. On March 21 of 2002, at the age of 21, Smith obtained the world record for the farthest distance a playing card had ever been thrown. After his accomplishment was publicized on Cleveland‚Äôs newspapers and TV channels, Smith began to be contacted by national television programs who requested that he perform his first live televised card throwing stunt on their show. He made his first TV appearance on Ripley‚Äôs Believe It Or Not, demonstrating his card throwing abilities in speed, distance, and precision. Since making his debut on Ripley‚Äôs Believe It Or Not in 2002, Smith has appeared on national television a number of times. His performances have been broadcast live on shows such as The Ellen Degeneres Show, Shark Tank, The Tonight Show, and America‚Äôs Got Talent. He has also appeared twice on Dude Perfect, a popular YouTube channel that records videos involving tricks and stunts. The first of these videos went viral and reached around 150 million views within three years. He has also been involved in the YouTube Red series, The Super Slow Show, starring Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy, showing off his card throwing ability to cut through almost three whole celery stalks. In addition to making appearances on the above broadcasts, Smith performs for individual clients as well as national corporations at events around the United States. His shows often include a combination of magic and card throwing stunts, many of which involve audience participation. Smith is also the founder and director of Magic Gives Back, an organization dedicated to raising money for school systems across the United States. Along with a group of performers, Smith organizes events in conjunction with school districts looking to bring in money for education- related projects and puts on pro-bono shows, the proceeds of which go to the school.  World records  Rick Smith Jr. currently holds three Guinness World Records for his work in card throwing: * The world record for the farthest playing card throw at 216 feet 4 inches (3/21/02) * The world record for the most accurate playing card throwing 46 out of 52 cards hit a five inch radius target in under a minute (4/22/2014) *The world record for the highest playing card throw at 70 feet 3 inches (3/14/15)  Filmography  Throughout his career, Smith has released a series of instructional movies aimed at audiences hoping to learn the basics of magic or card throwing. His releases include: Xtreme Beginnerz Card Handling Skills, which explains the basics of card throwing, pen spinning, and dice stacking; The Art of Card Throwing with Rick Smith Jr., which explains techniques for card throwing in greater detail; and Velocity (in collaboration with Murphy‚Äôs Magic), which also launches into the specific practices and skills necessary to be a masterful card thrower.

He first appeared alongside Diddy Kong of Nintendo's Donkey Kong series in Diddy Kong Racing. The character is stated to be 21 years of age by Nintendo. Conker is voiced by Chris Seavor in all of his appearances.  History  Conker was introduced to the world for the first time at E3 in 1997. His game, Conker's Quest, was presented by Rareware as another 3D platformer aimed at a young audience. Later the same year, this fact was confirmed with Conker's inclusion in Diddy Kong Racing, for the Nintendo 64, thus promoting his future games. In the spring of 1998, long after the initial release date, Conker's Quest was renamed as Twelve Tales: Conker 64. In 1999, Conker made his first solo debut in Conker's Pocket Tales for Game Boy Color. Before its release, the Nintendo 64 game underwent a complete transformation due to criticism for Twelve Tales being considered \\"another kids game\\". So the game eventually was released in 2001 as Conker's Bad Fur Day, which had been almost entirely redesigned, now geared towards a mature audience and featuring sexual content, foul language, drug and alcohol usage, and excessive violence. The game suffered from relatively poor sales on account of its release being close to the end of the N64's lifespan, but received a cult following with its unique brand of humor. In 2005, a remake was released for the Xbox known as Conker: Live & Reloaded. This featured Bad Fur Day with vastly improved graphics and minor alterations to gameplay. Also included was a never-before- seen multiplayer adaptation that was available for use over Xbox Live. After a canceled sequel by Rare, Conker was brought back in the game Project Spark, once again voiced by Seavor. An episodic campaign for the game called Conker's Big Reunion, set 10 years after Bad Fur Day, was released on April 23, 2015.http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/19/new-conker-game-coming-to-project- spark-april-23  Appearance  When Conker was introduced in Diddy Kong Racing, he had no gloves (in art only), a shirt that was blue in the front, and yellow in the back, blue and yellow Converse All Stars shoes and a flat- looking tail. This appearance was kept for Pocket Tales as well, but was changed in Bad Fur Day; Conker now had gloves, a blue zipper hoodie, and the same shoes, but with the Converse logo removed (likely to avoid copyright issues). In Live and Reloaded, he ditched the gloves (now using his bare hands) and had scruffier fur, giving him a somewhat unshaven appearance, and looked shorter and a tad stubbier. The single-player portion of the game was where his appearance changed drastically; his blue hoodie outfit was now more detailed, with yellow patches and more zippers, and the most noticeable change was that he was now wearing green and yellow shorts (similar to Banjo's). In Project Spark, Conker's appearance is based on that of Conker's Bad Fur Day, albeit much more detailed.  Character biography  = Donkey Kong series (Diddy Kong Racing)/Conker's Pocket Tales = Little is known of the character's origins or his early life. It is known that he had met and befriended Diddy Kong on his adventures prior to participating in races with Diddy and his friends, though he was never seen in the games preceding Diddy Kong Racing. Always kind-hearted and polite, his parents brought him up strictly, teaching him to never touch alcohol, urinate in public or be materialistic. After Diddy Kong Racing, in the story of Conker's Pocket Tales, he had his next adventure retrieving birthday presents from evil acorns. One day, he met a girl known as Berri, and the two quickly became a couple. Berri was originally depicted as a little, cute brown anthropomorphic chipmunk, but her design was later changed into a tall, curvaceous, buxom chipmunk with a valley girl-like personality and grey fur. = Bad Fur Day/Live & Reloaded = In Bad Fur Day, Conker is sarcastic, greedy and a heavy drinker implying he disobeyed the rules his parents said when he was a child. Still, he tended to maintain a civil demeanor when even faced by the roughest of characters, though he often thinks of snide remarks about them, and even insulted one person at least once.Conker: Were your parents related? Like, before they were married? Franky: Right! That's it. I am gonna give you a whupping! Here we go!\\" Although Conker drinks, commits lewd conduct and is very greedy, he seldom utters obscenities. Notably, the only truly real swears he has uttered were \\"fellatio\\" (albeit out of context), \\"bitch\\" and \\"ass\\", although the latter two were stated in the context of movie parodies in which the characters from the original movies stated exactly the same lines. He speaks in a lisp combined with a sped-up voice. In Live and Reloaded, Berri's ditzy traits still remain, but she is also depicted as a porn star, or prostitute of sorts, judging by various references in the remake. Conker and Berri developed an apparently strong relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend, as they soon began living together. Berri began to get frustrated with Conker's habit of constantly staying out late at a bar with his friends, until one fateful night, he never returned to his home. A very drunk Conker stumbled out in the opposite direction of his home, ending up in an entirely unfamiliar area ruled by the wrathful Panther King. A series of very bizarre and unfortunate events ensued until he was ultimately reunited with Berri, as well as with a massive quantity of money. He was about to leave with Berri when suddenly she was betrayed and murdered by a mafia boss, Don Weaso, eliminating one of his few true loves in the world. After the Panther King was eliminated, the people of the world all gathered at a throne room, pushed Conker onto the throne, shoved a crown on his head, and declared him the king. Although Conker had all the money and land in the world, he came to the realization that he did not want it, and that his only true reason of living was killed before his very eyes. Conker remained living unhappily as king of this strange world, when one night, his habits came back to him, and he found himself stumbling from the Cock and Plucker Bar, only going the other direction, opposite to the one that leads him to the horrible chain of events. This implies that he ends up going to yet another unusual world, or perhaps, back home, although this has never been further explained. According to an interview with Chris Seavor, there was going to be a sequel, Conker's Other Bad Fur Day, and Conker had been dethroned, imprisoned, and awaiting execution due to spending the entire royal treasury on beer, parties, and hookers. He then escapes with a ball-and-chain restraint locked on him. The entire plotline was already created, but due to Microsoft not asking for a Conker Sequel, the game production was shelved.\\"Conker Commands and Conquers\\". Mundo Rare, Sept. 16, 2008. In Conker's Bad Fur Day, Conker has ten prominent weapons: a pair of MP5-like machine guns (MP5K model), a shotgun, a set of throwing knives, a bazooka, a frying pan, a slingshot, a baseball bat with nails in it, a chainsaw (in the opening credits), a flamethrower and urine. In the opening of Conker's Bad Fur Day, he cut up the Nintendo 64 emblem with a chainsaw in half and replaced it with the Rare logo. In an Xbox commercial, he was shown with Banjo (Banjo- Kazooie), Joanna Dark and Kameo. Despite meeting Banjo in Diddy Kong Racing, he does not seem to remember him. Conker seems to have a hobby of cutting up logos with chainsaws and replacing them with the \\"Rare\\" logo, probably suggesting a twisted patriotism for the company. In the aforementioned commercial, he used a chainsaw to change the word \\"Xbox\\" into Rare. His future, both as a franchise and a character, remained uncertain until June 2014, where he was announced to appear in the game Project Spark. In Project Spark, the player could buy Conker's Big Reunion, and the Conker Character Creator pack. However, Conker's Big Reunion has been cancelled due to Microsoft announcing that the game would transition to a new \\"free and open creation\\" model, thus it would cease the production of all the downloadable content, including future Conker episodes. Reception Rare listed Conker as the fifth Rare's video game character who most improved with age. In 2009, Conker was ranked at the fourth place on GameDaily's \\"Top 25 Anti-Heroes\\" list, with they stating \\"he may not look like an anti-hero, but that's what makes Conker stand out from the rest.\\" IGN listed the \\"Ten Best Things About Conker: Live and Reloaded\\", saying \\"in the end, the reason we love Conker: Live and Reloaded so much is because of the big man himself\\", and also cited the \\"everyone's favorite boozy squirrel\\" among the \\"Gaming's Most Notorious Anti-Heroes\\", adding he is \\"cool\\". In his appearance in Conker: Live and Reloaded, he was called by GameSpy as \\"cuter than ever\\", and Dave Kosak said it \\"makes it all the funnier when he pukes or looks over his shoulder and blurts out a stream of beeped-out expletives.\\"  References  Category:Animal characters in video games Category:Anthropomorphic squirrels Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Fictional criminals in video games Category:Fictional mercenaries in video games Category:Conker (series) Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Fictional squirrels Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:King characters in video games Category:Male characters in video games Category:Child characters in video games Category:Microsoft protagonists Category:Rare (company) characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1997 ","title":"Conker the Squirrel"},{"id":"2177776","text":"Puente Viejo (, \\"Old Bridge\\") is the oldest and smallest of three bridges that span the deep chasm that carries the Guadalev√≠n River and divides the city of Ronda in southern Spain.

The Shifting Grounds of Race: Black and Japanese Americans in the Making of Multiethnic Los Angeles. Princeton: Princeton University Press.Bunje, Emil T. H. 1957. The Story of Japanese Farming in California. Saratoga, California: Robert D. Reed.  History and context  Leading up to the passage of the 1913 Alien Land Law, there had been growing anti-Asian prejudice in California and in the United States in general, first against the Chinese during the 19th century, culminating with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and then against the Japanese during the 20th century. Anti-Japanese sentiment was often expressed in racist Yellow Peril arguments.Daniels, Roger, The Politics of Prejudice: The Anti-Japanese Movement in California and the Struggle for Japanese Exclusion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1962). In 1900, there was an influx of over 12,000 Japanese immigrants to the US mainland, many of whom had just been released from indentured labor with Hawaii's 1898 annexation. Many Japanese immigrants settled in California and relocated to rural areas after they initially landed in cities. Farming became the major economic foundation for the Japanese population in California, and they saw it as a way to prove their productive abilities and to establish a sense of permanency in their new nation. Gradually, many moved from farm labor into truck farming and filled the niche market for perishable crops. The sudden increases in Japanese immigration in that and subsequent years spurred many anti-Japanese political and organizational movements in California, and the introduction of anti-Asian legislation to the California legislature, all of which influenced public sentiment. Many workers returning from World War I felt that the Japanese were infringing on their job opportunities. In addition, some feared that the Japanese were attempting to overtake white control of California‚Äôs farmland. The Los Angeles Times and groups such as the Anti-Asiatic Association were vocal instigators of the anti-Japanese movement. In 1907, in accordance with the Gentlemen's Agreement, the United States and Japan agreed to limit Japanese migration to the United States, with Japan agreeing that it would stop issuing passports to persons intending to migrate as laborers who had no established future residence in the United States or had no family members already in the United States.Gaines, Brian J. and Wendy K. Tam Cho. 2004. \\"On California's 1920 Alien Land Law: The Psychology and Economics of Racial Discrimination.\\" State Politics and Policy Quarterly 4 (3): 271. The Japanese possessed the right to lease and own land in the United States for residential and commercial use based on the 1911 American treaty with Japan. In 1910, most Japanese were working in the agricultural and fishing industries. Rights to agricultural land, unprotected by treaty, thus became the focus for the Alien Land Laws, as state-level deterrents to immigration were sought in a dearth of federal-level involvement. The Japanese presence in California as agricultural laborers and tenant farmers rapidly grew during the first two decades of the 20th century. They filled a labor void in farming previously occupied by the Chinese, whose numbers had sharply declined with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Especially through tenant farming, Japanese families hoped to save enough money to eventually purchase their own land. Though it was meant to decrease immigration, the 1913 law likely had relatively little actual impact on Japanese farmers, and in fact, after the passage of the 1913 law, their numbers rose. Many Japanese immigrants, or issei, circumvented that law by transferring the title of their land to their American-born children, or nisei, who were US citizens. By 1915, three quarters of the vegetables consumed by Los Angeles residents were grown by Japanese.  California Alien Land Law of 1920  The California Alien Land Law of 1920 continued the 1913 law while filling many of its loopholes. Among the loopholes filled were that the leasing of land for a period of three years or less was no longer allowed; owning of stock in companies that acquired agricultural land was forbidden; and guardians or agents of ineligible aliens were required to submit an annual report on their activities. The 1920 Alien Land Law was passed in reaction to the intensification of anti-Japanese sentiment, and to the fact that the 1913 Alien Land Law was doing little to stem Japanese immigration to California. The law was approved by the voters after being proposed by the California State Legislature. It passed with a vote of 668,438 to 222,086. The 1920 law was amended in 1923 to further fill wording-related loopholes. There is not complete agreement about the effects of the 1920 law. It is thought by some to have had a significant negative impact on Japanese involvement in agriculture. For example, the amount of agricultural land controlled by Japanese decreased by approximately 40 percent between 1920 and 1930, and total acres farmed by Japanese persons declined by 47 percent. During the 1920s, there was a general decline in the agricultural economy in California and elsewhere in the United States, which would have partially contributed to the sudden downturn in Japanese farming. Many Japanese were also able to evade the law, often by claiming to be farm ‚Äúmanagers.‚Äù There were at least sixteen prosecutions of Japanese for violations of the Alien Land Law from 1920 to 1940, but there were likely many more. Although the Alien Land Laws made farming more difficult for them, the Japanese still managed to maintain a fairly high level of economic success in the agricultural industry. In 1915, Japanese Foreign Minister Komei Kato likely spoke for many Japanese when he expressed the sentiment that Japanese immigrants were dismayed by being singled out in such a fashion by the Alien Land Law legislation.  Related court cases  In 1923, the laws were upheld in the United States Supreme Court and were determined not to be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The 1946 Supreme Court of California case People v. Oyama reaffirmed the 1923 decision, determining that Japanese immigrant Kajiro Oyama had attempted to evade the Alien Land Laws by purchasing farmland that he placed in the name of his son, who was a U.S. citizen. In fact, Oyama‚Äôs petition to be named as his son‚Äôs guardian in order to have authority over the land had been approved by a local court. This method was a major way in which the Japanese were able to acquire agricultural land during this period, since most other options were closed to them. The case was then reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in Oyama v. California after petitioning by the Oyamas and their supporters. The majority opinion held that Fred Oyama‚Äôs rights as a U.S. citizen to take and hold property had been violated by the state of California. The decision was arguably instrumental in helping to bring about a shift in attitudes toward the Japanese and their property rights.Villazor, Rose Cuison. 2010. \\"Rediscovering Oyama v. California: At the Intersection of Property, Race, and Citizenship.\\" Washington University Law Review 87: 979. The Alien Land Laws were invalidated in 1952 by the Supreme Court of California as a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution in Sei Fujii v. California.Sei Fujii v. California, 242 P.2d 617 (Cal. 1952) Fujii was a longtime Los Angeles resident, but was not a U.S. citizen. He alleged that the law violated the California and United States Constitutions, and that it also went against the spirit of the United Nations Charter to which the United States was bound by treaty. The California District Court of Appeal had decided in 1950 that the Alien Land Law was in violation of Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter. The Supreme Court of California then ordered the case transferred for hearing and settlement, as it was determined to be a sufficiently important question of law.Fairman, Charles. 1952. \\"Finis to Fuji.\\" The American Journal of International Law 56 (4): 682.\\"The Influence of Sei Fujii.\\" 1950.Congressional Digest 29 (12): 301.  Criticism  The laws are widely held to have been discriminatory measures specifically targeting the Japanese, spurred by fears about the increasing number of Japanese immigrants settling in California. The choice to apply the laws only to those aliens ineligible for citizenship rather than to all aliens meant that European aliens would not be affected. Because of this, the bill was decidedly directed at Asians and specifically at the Japanese, who had become a strong presence in the agricultural labor market as well as in the control of farms. The Alien Land Laws were part of a larger trend of attempted discrimination against the Japanese through policy in California during the early 20th century.  Related acts  Eight other American states passed restrictive land-ownership laws during the years 1913‚Äì25. These states were Arizona, Washington, Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. Arkansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah, and Wyoming followed with the passage of Alien Land Laws during the World War II years. Florida is the only state that has not repealed its Alien Land Law.

Travis Meeks is widely considered in the Grunge subculture to be one of the greatest albeit most underrated acoustic guitarists and performers of all- time. Much of Meeks' work has been acclaimed for its unique quality, and he is considered an inspiration for his artistic, spiritual and creative take on songwriting. Despite his musical accomplishments, throughout his life as well as in recent years, he has been battling drug addiction - causing the break up of his 2014 reunion with the original line-up of Days Of The New shortly after it began for the second time. Since then, he has been arrested several times for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, serving jail time. As of 2020, it has been reported that Meeks is temporarily retired and focusing on his recovery. Early life and career Meeks was born on April 27, 1979 in Charlestown, Indiana. His parents divorced when he was 2, and he lived with his grandmother and father. His father was a musician. At a young age, he began playing guitar and wrote songs and performed covers by age 8. Between ages 11 to 15, he went to various rehabilitation centers and a year in special schooling. During that time, he formed an experimental rock band called Bad Dreemz which included Jesse Vest and Matt Taul. They then formed Dead Reckoning, which was a heavy metal band that sounded similar to Pantera. In 1995, Meeks moved to Louisville, and Dead Reckoning changed its name to Days of the New as well as its genre to an acoustic rock, post-grunge style. Regarding that era, Meeks stated, \\"I went through paranoia and acid trips, separation from the mind and body... That's where my spiritual journey begins.\\" Days of the New At the age of 17, Meeks and fellow teenage band members Matt Taul, Todd Whitener and Jesse Vest were signed to a major record label. In 1997, they released their widely successful self-titled Yellow album that included the single, \\"Touch, Peel and Stand.\\" The song rose to #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and became the group's signature piece. Opening slots on tour with Jerry Cantrell and Metallica further exposed the band to fans around the country. Days of the New then set out on a headlining tour that lasted until a stop in Dallas, Texas when Meeks' father finally drove him home and canceled the remainder of the tour's shows. Much misinformation has spread about Travis Meeks over the years regarding the matter of the debut incarnation of Days of the New. Meeks in fact did not fire his former bandmates. Boiling physical and verbal tension surrounding the stress of their current circumstances with opening for Metallica as teenagers as well as creative differences in their music resulted in a mutual parting of ways. As the hired hands of Meeks' first release (Jesse Vest, Todd Whitener and Matt Taul) later went on to form Tantric with vocalist Hugo Ferreira, misunderstandings as well as inaccuracies led into a general consensus being him firing his former friends. While Meeks was not a fan of their music nor appeal, he was proud of his former bandmates for achieving their success through Tantric. The incident had no influence on Meeks' drug use. Since the Release of Days of the New (2001 album) Meeks has continued writing music and uploading it on websites such as MySpace with continued usage of the Days Of The New name. Notable fan favourite demos are to name a few; Story of a Friend, Where It Ends and Superhero (Latter two from the delayed Purple Album) Among many more. Meeks has standing invitations to perform at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, as well as to front the Boston Pops. 'You're talking to a miracle - Travis Meeks heals one piece at a time' He has referred to himself as a \\"maestro\\" due to his \\"self-taught mastery\\" of the acoustic guitar and incorporation of classical sounds into his music.Meeks has also declared himself to be a reincarnation of 18th century Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, going so far as to wear powdered wigs while performing. 'Travis Meeks's Biography' Fan leaks of unreleased material took place from 2006 to 2020. Travis suffered a brief mental breakdown whilst discovering the demos for the Purple album were being downloaded and shared by fans, which likely lead into his short 2007 relapse, but exact reason for why is unknown. During these years however, the individuals responsible behind the maintaining of Days of the New's business practices were notably disrespectful towards anticipated fans, usually out of blind loyalty to Travis and his recovery - and deliberately outright hid material from wanting fans for decades. In 2020, dramatic antics on social media within the fanbase as well as rising fan anticipation resulted in a large leak of unreleased Days of the New material under a YouTube channel anonymously donning the pseudonym \\"Maestro Music\\". Leaks include a majority of the Days of the New Presents Tree Colors album under the color Rainbow, demo material from studio sessions in 2002 and 2003 (during Travis' initial methamphetamine addiction) making up the unreleased fourth 'Purple' album, all of the material from Travis' early metal band Dead Reckoning, an unreleased metal split from 2002 'Not Of This World' under the color Chrome which consisted of the Red lineup and local collaborating musician David \\"Sailor\\" Bryant of 16 Bones, and an EP from 2014 entitled \\"Aqua Marine Shuttle\\" under the color Blue. Critical reception was overwhelmingly positive, despite a violent vocal minority. Travis Meeks himself has went on record saying that he is abysmal to such leaks, yet hopes to hold onto his material and continue perfecting his craft. However, it is widely considered the closest instance to a Tree Colors release that will likely take place in current inception. Personal life Travis has Asperger's Syndrome, and considers this to be the ulterior reason behind most of his faults and shortcomings, while still being content. Meeks has two daughters from previous relationships. His first daughter, Suvanna Dawn Meeks, (who was later put up for adoption) was born in 1994 from his relationship with his then girlfriend Amy. His second daughter, Emma Rambat, was born November 11, 2004 with his then girlfriend Karen.http://www.louisvillemusicnews.net/lmn/issues/2003/2003October/travismeeks.php In 2008, Meeks was maintaining sobriety and promoting his upcoming comeback album titled \\"Days of the New Presents Tree Colors\\" produced under his independent label, Days of the New Productions. However, lack of distribution and finances as a result of the IRS siezing his royalties continually delayed the albums' official release. After finding the body of his friend Mike Starr - the former bassist of Alice in Chains - in 2011, later resulting in a divorce in 2012 prompting a one year hiatus, followed by the passing of Meeks' father, Gary Lee Meeks, on November 15, 2013 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Indianapolis, IN at the age of 57; and the incidents surrounding the Full Circle reunion tour in 2014 including the original band breaking up for a second time and being arrested in Portland, Maine for failing to appear in court after being charged with possession of a hypodermic needle. \\\\- prompted him to relapse on methamphetamine in 2015 and spend a year in prison during 2016. After being released, Meeks made appearances on social media voicing his philosophy, only to later then be arrested in 2017 for charges of burglary, fleeing or evading police on foot, public intoxication charges, and possession of a controlled substance.http://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/hardin-county-jail- log-june-18-2017 In 2020 he was arrested for disorderly conduct, failure to obey a police officer, and resisting arrest.https://www.maricopapublicrecords.com/full-record- display.php?id=203188http://jailed.info/travis-shane-meeks/maricopa-county- az/369010/ However, it has been reported that Meeks is currently as of 2020 focusing on self improvement outside of the spotlight, and aims to reach sobriety and recovery. In other media In September of 2000, Meeks performed with The Doors on VH1 Storytellers - The Doors: A Celebration, and covered their magnum opus - The End. His cover was considered by many to be exceptionally amazing, as The Doors would not allow anyone else to cover the song. Travis also was enthusiastically offered an audition by then ex-members of Guns N' Roses to be the vocalist and frontman of Velvet Revolver in 2001, however his creative differences as well as his predicament with addiction resulted in them declining Travis - only for the late Scott Weiland to then be given the frontman role. In April 2005, Meeks was showcased in an episode of A&E;'s hit TV series Intervention, which was filmed in February that year. Meeks' addiction to methamphetamine was one of the two subjects for this episode. He decided to go to rehab at Cirque Lodge in Provo, Utah, but the episode ends with Meeks checking out early after 73 days. After a period of relapsing, he remained sober since September 19, 2005 until a brief relapse in September 2007. According to a follow-up interview with Intervention, Meeks has since remained sober. In an online interview with Meeks, licensed clinical counselor and blogger Stephen Borgman described Meeks' Asperger syndrome and included many descriptions by Meeks himself. In this way, Meeks stated that he had \\"lived with intense shame and the feeling of extreme inadequacy. Everything I felt I did was wrong and that I could do nothing right. I wasn't diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until 2005. [‚Ä¶] Thanks to my father Gary Meeks, he knew I was different and tried to protect me from the vultures of punishment. I felt severely punished anyway by the way I felt when I was removed from my comfort zones such as putting me in school.\\" On April 25, 2008, an interview with Meeks was featured on the podcast series, Uncensored Net Noise.http://podcast.morningshowcentral.com/?p=84 Musical style Meeks plays Taylor guitars for their rich sound but has also used Tacomas. Much of his catalog is performed in various open tunings. He also favors acoustic guitar over electric, once citing: :\\"Acoustic guitars are more musical. They're not all covered up by different sounds and distortions and stuff. Of course we put distortion on our guitars, but I like to go make campfires and sit out by the water, and you can't do that with an electric guitar. Each acoustic guitar has its own soul; it seems way more natural to play than electric.\\"Parker, Lyndsey Exclusive LAUNCH Artist Chat - Days of the New Yahoo! Music (November 8, 2008).

It stars Charles Bronson as Chaney, a drifter freighthopping through Louisiana during the Great Depression, who competes in illegal bare- knuckled boxing matches after forming a partnership with the garrulous hustler Speed, played by James Coburn.  Plot  In 1933 a man dressed in simple clothes with a hobo appearance carrying a handbag jumps down from the boxcar of a slow-moving train on the outskirts of an anonymous town somewhere in Louisiana. He soon comes upon a bare-knuckled street fight run by gamblers, which he intently observes. After the bout, the man approaches the fast- talking \\"Speed\\", the backer of the losing fighter. Introducing himself as Chaney (Charles Bronson), he asks Speed to set up a fight for him, which Speed does. Before the fight, his opponent, the winner of the contest he previously witnessed, looks Chaney up and down and asks disparagingly if he isn't a little too old to be there. Betting all of the six dollars he possesses on himself, Chaney responds by dispatching the younger man with a single punch. Suitably impressed, Speed offers to become Chaney's manager, but Chaney cautions Speed that he needs only enough money to \\"fill a few in-betweens\\" before moving on. They travel to New Orleans where Speed plans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds. Chaney finds lodgings in a rundown rooming house. At a diner, he meets Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland), a lonely woman whose husband is in prison. They begin an uneasy affair. Speed recruits the genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin), \\"a dyed in the wool hophead\\" whose spell at medical school many years before was cut short, Poe confesses, due to his fondness for opium. Chaney nonetheless accedes to Speed's request and accepts Poe's services at the going rate. Speed arranges another fight, this time in bayou country. Chaney, Speed and Poe are accompanied on the trip by Speed's lady friend, Gayleen (Margaret Blye). Chaney easily disposes of the Cajun hitter, but the hitter's sponsor, Pettibon (Edward Walsh), refuses to pay up on the grounds that Chaney is a ringer. Chaney seems to accept matters and persuades the indignant Speed to leave. However, later that evening Chaney and his retinue appear unannounced at Pettibon's backwoods honky-tonk. Overcoming Pettibon's confederates with his fists, Chaney seizes a pistol, forces Pettibon to turn over the unpaid cash, and proceeds to shoot up Pettibon's joint until all the bullets are discharged. The troupe drives back to New Orleans in high spirits. Speed next arranges for Chaney to take on the city's undefeated bare-knuckle fighter Jim Henry (Robert Tessier), an intimidating brawler with a bald pate and bull neck, who is bankrolled by wealthy businessman Chick Gandil (Michael McGuire). Gandil insists that Speed put up $3,000 instead of the stake of $1000 that Speed had anticipated. To cover the shortfall, Speed obtains a loan from a gang of local mobsters headed by Doty (Bruce Glover). Chaney fights Jim Henry, who resists stubbornly but finally succumbs, beaten to the ground under a flurry of blows from Chaney. The trio of Chaney, Speed and Poe celebrate at a juke joint with their lady friends. Speed gets into a game of dice and gambles away his share of the winnings. The mobsters stalk Speed because of the money he owes. Gandil attempts to get Chaney to switch sides and fight for him. Speed is willing because it will square his debts, but Chaney refuses to go along, and they argue bitterly. As well, Lucy ends her affair with Chaney, dissatisfied with his emotional distance and lack of commitment. Meanwhile, Gandil brings in a top fighter from Chicago, the aptly named Street (Nick Dimitri), a sleek and silent gent who arrives at the train station expensively clad in a black hat and black leather blazer, and whose baggage the demoted Jim Henry is now required to carry. Unable to draw Chaney into a winner-take- all bout, Gandil pays off Speed's debt and takes him hostage. If there is no fight, threatens Gandil, Speed will be killed. Poe visits Chaney at the rooming house to tell him about Speed's predicament. Chaney comes to Gandil's warehouse where the fight will take place. Not only is he forced to fight for Speed's life, but he must risk all of his own winnings. Street proves a formidable opponent. The two take turns knocking each other down. Eventually Chaney wins the grueling bout, but not before Street, on his hands and knees, refuses Gandil's demand that he use extraordinary means (a pair of brass cylinders) to avert defeat, sweeping them aside when they are placed on the ground in front of him. Instead, Street gamely staggers to his feet and goes down swinging. Speed's life is spared. True to his word, Chaney decides the time has come to move on. He gives Speed and Poe a generous cut of the winnings and walks alone towards the railroad tracks. As Chaney disappears into the darkness, Speed declares, \\"He sure was something.\\"  Cast *Chaney (Charles Bronson) ‚Äì a man of few words and limited means, with no past or permanent relationships, who is riding the rails during the Depression. *Spencer \\"Speed\\" Weed (James Coburn) ‚Äì a glib and shady opportunist who acts as Chaney's manager. *Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland) ‚Äì a married woman living alone with whom Chaney briefly becomes involved. *Poe (Strother Martin) ‚Äì a former medical student and opium addict hired to repair Chaney's cuts. *Jim Henry (Robert Tessier) ‚Äì a feared New Orleans street fighter who meets his match in Chaney. *Chick Gandil (Michael McGuire) ‚Äì an unscrupulous businessman, and Speed's more successful rival, who bankrolls Jim Henry. *Street (Nick Dimitri) ‚Äì a black leather blazer wearing street fighter Gandil recruits to face Chaney in the climactic fight. *Gayleen Schoonover (Margaret Blye) ‚Äì Speed's companion. *Thomas Jefferson ‚Äì uncredited cameo by the jazz trumpeter  Production  =Development= In the early 1970s Walter Hill had developed a strong reputation as a screenwriter, particularly of action films such as The Getaway. He was approached by Larry Gordon when the latter was head of production at AIP, who offered Hill the chance to direct one of his scripts. (AIP had recently done this with John Milius on Dillinger (1973).) Gordon subsequently moved over to Columbia, where he established a unit making low budget action films, and got funding for Hill's project; it was to be the first from Gordon's unit. Hill wrote and directed for scale even though \\"the truth is, I would have paid them for the chance.\\" The project began as an original screenplay by Bryan Gindoff and Bruce Henstell called The Streetfighter. Hill thought the project could become more \\"up market\\" if he made it more like a Western and set it in the past; Gordon was from New Orleans and suggested setting it in that city. Hill says the script incorporated elements of an earlier Western he had written, Lloyd Williams and his Brother. He wrote it in a style inspired by Alexander Jacobs ‚Äì \\"extremely spare, almost Haiku style. Both stage directions and dialogue.\\" Hill wrote one draft, then rewrote it \\"five or six times before I finally got it. But I did get it and I knew it. I knew it was going to get an actor and get made.\\" =Casting= Hill says he originally wrote the film intending to cast a younger actor, like Jan Michael Vincent, and that he wanted Warren Oates to play Coburn's role. According to Hill, \\"they had offered it to a couple of actors and they didn't want to do it.\\" Then it was sent to Charles Bronson even though Hill thought he was \\"too old\\". A day later, Bronson's agent called back and said Bronson had read the script and wanted to do the film \\"but he had to meet me. He wanted to see if I measured up.\\" Hill remembers that Bronson \\"was in remarkable physical condition for a guy his age; I think he was about 52 at the time. He had excellent coordination, and a splendid build. His one problem was that he was a smoker, so he didn't have a lot of stamina. I mean, he probably could have kicked anybody's ass on that movie, but he couldn't fight much longer than 30 or 40 seconds.\\"Jon Zelazny, 'Kicking Ass with Walter Hill', The Hollywood Interview, 8 Sept 2009 Hill later said Bronson received \\"very close to a million\\" dollars for his role. =Production= The film was shot on location in Louisiana. Hill says his cinematographer Philip Lathrop was incredibly useful during the shoot: > Before we started I was in my office later at night and Lathrop came by, > noted I wasn't in a good mood. \\"Anything wrong?\\" I had never done it, > worried if I will make it look alright. He immediately said \\"Don't worry > about that. We will make a film, make the shots. If you are having a problem > we will make the shots. I can already tell you you are ahead of other > directors.\\" He said \\"Anything we shoot we will cut together.\\" He said \\"The > problem that you're going to have is making everybody getting along and you > getting what you want.\\" And he was of course 100 percent right. That is the > problem with direction. Beyond my first or second film, I don't think I've > ever had terrible dilemmas based upon resources, but shooting and figuring > out how is not a problem, never was. The problems that you have are getting > everybody to be on the same page. Hill says that Bronson was more supportive to work with than Coburn: > [Bronson was a] very angry guy ... Didn't get along with a lot of people. > The only reason I can tell you he and I got along well was he respected that > I wrote the script. He liked the script. Also I didn't try to get close to > him. Kept it very business-like. I think he liked that. Jimmy Coburn who > everybody liked and got along well with, he and I did not get along well. I > think he was not in a good mood about being in a movie with Charlie, it was > second banana. He had been up there more, and his career was coming back a > bit. I don't think he was wild about being second banana. But Charlie was a > big star, perceived to be low rent. That was part of his anger ... He > thought there was a cosmic injustice when he was not a movie star at 35. He > didn't get there till 45 or whatever ... [However] When things had seemed to > not be working well, or there was some impasse, Charlie would come down hard > on my side. That was tipping point. Hill had troubles with Strother Martin. \\"When he was good he was very good, but he could be just awful\\", Hill later said. \\"I said to him once, 'Divide it in half, Strother,' and he said 'In half,' and I answered, 'That's if you want it to be in the movie.'\\" Hill said he used few tracking shots and zoom shots because \\"I like to work within frame and composition, but when you move your camera you can lose composition because it is altering shape.\\" He also decided to use background music quiet and subdued \\"to get a sense of restraint in the movie ... people fighting is an ugly thing and I didn't want to encourage people to go out and fight. The concept of movie was hopefully legendary and somewhat heroic so that one couldn't really take a realistic approach.\\" Hill said the fights were \\"dances. That is why there was no blood. People commented, \\"the fights are great but they would have been better if you had put some blood in them.\\" What they don't realize is as soon as you put blood in those fights they would then have gotten so real that they would have lost their dramatic truth.\\" Original cut of the movie was around two hours long. When it was cut down to around 90 minutes several fights scenes were deleted. Some stills however show some of the deleted fights. Hill described the music as \\"kind of western; kind of simple and country. Nicely understated. \\"  Release  The film was profitable and in 2009, Hill said he was still receiving money from it. \\"It was the best deal I ever made\\", he recalled. \\"Got a career out of it. Picture was well received on the whole, made money. Got me off and going.\\"\\"Interview with Walter Hill Chapter 4\\" Directors Guild of America accessed 12 July 2014 However he never made another film with Bronson. \\"We had kind of a falling out over the film,\\" the director said. \\"He thought I'd been a little too ... how do I put this? Too draconian in my editing of his wife's (Jill Ireland's) scenes.\\" The movie established a template to which Hill often returned. > My heroes usually have a very talkative foil opposite them or reluctantly > alongside them, such as Bruce Dern in The Driver, or Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs, > or James Coburn in Hard Times. I like the kind of dialogue between people > who have a mutual goal but very disparate appetites and needs, so that > there's always a kind of friction that runs throughout the film. They don't > like each other very much, and hopefully the movie supplies a reason for > them to achieve a grudging kind of respect for each other.John Patterson, > \\"Walter Hill: a life in the fast lane\\", The Guardian,, 18 July 2014, > accessed 6 February 2015  Critical reception  The film has a 92% fresh rating on the film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 critic's reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1009211-hard_times/ Pauline Kael called the setting of Hard Times \\"elaborate period recreations that seem almost to be there for their own sake.\\" The film is about the personalities of street fighters and their agents, people on the margins of society. On the other hand, setting the film in the Depression might have been a way for Hill to make Chaney a more sympathetic character. Kael explains, \\"Put [Charles Bronson] in modern clothes and he's a hard-bitten tough guy, but with that cap on he's one of the dispossessed ‚Äî an honest man who's known hunger\\".Kael, Pauline. \\"The Visceral Poetry of Pulp.\\" CSUN Cinematheque Notes:Hard Times', The Driver. 2005: 6-7 Roger Ebert in his October 14, 1975, review of Hard Times in the Chicago Sun-Times called it \\"a powerful, brutal film containing a definitive Charles Bronson performance.\\"*Ebert, Roger.

A notorious crime boss and prominent figure in the Maggia, a fictional organized crime syndicate, he is usually depicted as an adversary of the superhero Spider-Man and the father of Joseph Manfredi. Silvermane later became a cyborg in an attempt to extend his lifespan. The character has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series and video games. Publication history He first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #73 and was created by Stan Lee and John Buscema. The character's original storyline was about a mysterious stone tablet coveted by several Spider-Man villains. The \\"Tablet Saga\\" proved popular, although artist John Romita, Sr. said that it was not originally intended as an arc: \\"We never even thought up Silvermane until the seventh issue [of the story arc], let alone a 'socko' ending.\\" Fictional character biography Silvio Manfredi, nicknamed \\"Silvermane\\" for his near-white hair, is a professional criminal originally from Corleone, Sicily that started his criminal career as a racketeer in the Maggia organized crime group, eventually becoming a criminal organizer and mastermind. In his first appearance, he forced Dr. Curt Connors into making a mystical youth potion from an ancient clay tablet. He first crossed paths with the Lizard and Spider-Man during this scheme. Drinking the serum made Silvermane younger, but its effect unintentionally led to him becoming a child and then reached the point before the age of birth and disappearing completely.The Amazing Spider-Man #73-75 Silvermane eventually reappeared, revealing that he had mystically aged to his forties. He climbed through the ranks and became the crime family's head; he eventually formed an alliance with the worldwide Hydra organization determined to take over the world as their Supreme Hydra. He was defeated by Daredevil, Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.Daredevil #121-123 Silvermane reappeared in New York in an attempt to unite all of New York's gangs under his leadership and take over the criminal underworld, but his plans were complicated by the Green Goblin who opposed him. During a confrontation between the Goblin, Silvermane and Spider-Man, Silvermane fell from a great height but survived.The Amazing Spider-Man #176-180 Silvermane has hired many criminals, such as Hammerhead, and he has also been known to be a rival of the Kingpin. Silvermane once attempted to assassinate an amnesiac Kingpin.The Amazing Spider-Man #197 His former partner Dominic Tyrone assumed the identity of the Rapier and sought vengeance against Silvermane's betrayal by attempting to slay him.The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #2 A flashback one-shot focused heavily on Silvermane's lifetime of corruption. The framework was the reporter Ben Urich investigating the Mafia. He found Silvermane was a legendary Mafia figure for decades; mothers would even warn their children to behave or 'One-Eye' would get them.Spider-Man: Made Men #1 (August 1998) In his old age, Silvermane's injuries resulted in undoing the effects of the rejuvenation serum. Though bedridden, he continued to run his criminal empire until Dagger nearly killed him. Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himself into a cyborg.The Spectacular Spider-Man #69-70 Kingpin gained control of his cyborg body until Dagger restored his life energy to him.The Spectacular Spider-Man #94-96 His cyborg body was badly damaged by the first Jack O'Lantern during a gang war between Hammerhead and the Kingpin.The Amazing Spider-Man #284 Silvermane used a remote-controlled android doppelganger to battle Spider-Man. This was part of an attempt to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting parts from the superhuman body of Spider-Man. He attempted to drain his nemesis's radioactive blood to mobilize a new stronger cyborg body.Web of Spider-Man #79-80 Silvermane confronted Deathlok and the Punisher while setting up a major drug operation outside a grammar school.Deathlok #8-9 He is still an active member of the Maggia. Silvermane attempted to take part in a meetup of various criminal warlords, during a time when Wilson Fisk had fallen from power. The meeting's goal was to divide up Fisk's resources, but it did not go well. Silvermane was caught in the crossfire between the Secret Empire's forces and the Punisher. This was purely by coincidence as he was simply staying at the same motel as Punisher was. Silvermane used the resources of his semi and the cyborg bodies stored within to battle his way through the attackers and leave.Punisher War Journal #46-48 It was revealed some time later that Silvermane was killed during a shootout against Owl's gang at a New York City scrap yard. He was picked up by a magnet and dropped into a garbage compactor, crushing him to death and leaving the already troubled Maggia crime syndicate without a leader. Months later, he apparently returns along with various other deceased members during the Maggia's losing battle with the forces of Mister Negative. However this is later revealed to be a ruse by Maggia member Carmine, and that \\"Silvermane\\" was actually a robot controlled by a hired Mysterio in order to secretly give Carmine more influence in the syndicate's decision-making. The tables are turned on Carmine when Mysterio uses the robot to murder him, seemingly as a plot to take over the Maggia himself.The Amazing Spider-Man #618-620 Silvermane's head was still alive as it was found by a young boy when he traveled into the scrap yard. His head was in the possession of the boy who is currently building a robot, but then is stolen by Shocker.The Superior Foes of Spider-Man #3 The head is used as leverage by The Superior Foes of Spider-Man to head the Maggia family, but the team double-crosses each other. Shocker defends the mob boss from the Punisher, so Silvermane nominates him as Don of the Maggia family.The Superior Foes of Spider-Man #17 Powers and abilities Silvermane was once a normal human being with no superhuman abilities. He was a superb hand-to-hand combatant, an excellent marksman, and a brilliant strategist and organizer. He is typically armed with various handguns and a Thompson .45 caliber machine gun. Later, Silvermane's brain, vital organs, and head were transplanted into a cyborg body, increasing his physical abilities and giving him superhuman strength and senses. However, Silvermane's organic body parts are those of a frail 80-year-old man, and hence quite vulnerable. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Silvermane had a brief cameo. With Wilson Fisk lying low due to legal problems, Silvermane decided to work with Hammerhead to remove the Kingpin from power. He told Hammerhead that all was needed was a little 'up here' (referring to his intelligence). Hammerhead, however, wanted it all, breaking Silvermane's neck while saying \\"I think I got enough up here already.\\"Ultimate Spider-Man #79 Silvermane was also mentioned as a leader of a mob which included Hammerhead and owing a debt to Nathaniel Essex.Ultimate X-Men #14 (March 2002) The Ultimate incarnation's real name is shown in the Daily Bugle as Allan Silvermane, though he's referred to as Silvio Manfredi.Ultimate Spider-Man #79 =House of M= Silvermane appeared in the House of M reality as a younger crime boss on the many families captured by the NYPD's Brotherhood unit.House of M: Avengers #3 In other media =Television= Tombstone in Spider-Man: The Animated Series * Silvermane appeared in the 1980s Spider-Man animated series episode \\"Wrath of the Sub-Mariner\\", voiced by Paul Winchell. He and Man Mountain Marko arrive in New York to call a truce with the Kingpin after his scientist Dr. Everett develops a powerful solvent capable of eating through anything. Prior to this, Spider-Man intercepted them, but Silvermane could not be brought in since most of his crimes are on the West Coast. * Silvermane appeared in the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Jeff Corey. This version is an enemy of Spider-Man and the Kingpin, the latter of whom serves as his rival in New York's criminal underworld. He first appeared in the \\"Insidious Six\\" arc, hiring Hammerhead to capture Spider-Man. During the titular team's battle, Spider-Man rescued Silvermane from Kingpin, not realizing his true identity as a crime lord until much later. Following this appearance, Silvermane became obsessed with finding the Tablet of Time, an artifact capable of rejuvenating an individual's youth, so he could achieve immortality due to his irregular childhood. After locating it, he arranged for Tombstone to steal it, kidnap Dr. Curt Connors to decipher it, and take the scientist's family hostage to ensure his complicity. Though Spider-Man saved the Connors family and in spite of Dr. Connors warning of the tablet's instability, Silvermane uses it to make himself a young man (voiced by Townsend Coleman) before he becomes a child (voiced by Matthew McCurley) and a baby (voiced by Cannon Young), while Hammerhead steals the Tablet on Kingpin's behalf. In the episode \\"Partners\\", Silvermane retained his adult intellect despite becoming a baby, but required help from his daughter, Alisa Silver. Together, they persuaded Alistair Smythe to kidnap Black Cat and blackmail Spider-Man into apprehending Scorpion so Silvermane can use neogenic technology to switch bodies with the web-slinger. During the procedure however, Vulture intervenes and accidentally takes Spider-Man's place, allowing the web-slinger, Black Cat, and Scorpion to escape. Following this, Vulture becomes a young man while Silvermane is returned to his original state. * Silvermane appears in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Miguel Ferrer. This version is a crime lord, rival to Tombstone, and the father of Sable Manfredi. The episode \\"Accomplices\\" revealed that Silvermane was arrested and jailed 12 years prior after Frederick Foswell exposed his criminal activities to the FBI. Tombstone subsequently took his territory while Sable ran his empire's remnants in his absence. In \\"Gangland\\", Silvermane joins a summit between him, Tombstone, and Doctor Octopus. After the meeting goes sideways and Spider-Man gets involved, Silvermane uses a hidden hydraulic exoskeleton to combat the web-slinger and the other crime bosses, only to be defeated and apprehended by the police. As of \\"Opening Night\\", Silvermane was remanded the Vault. Though he was released by the Green Goblin to kill Spider-Man while he was there to test the prison's security system, Silvermane was ultimately defeated and returned to his cell. * Silvermane appears in the 2010s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Nolan North. Similarly to past depictions, this version is a notorious, elderly crime boss who sports an exoskeleton. In the episode \\"Bring on the Bad Guys Pt. 3\\", he takes Abraham Brown hostage to force the Prowler to capture Spider- Man so he can collect on a bounty on the web-slinger's head. After Spider-Man convinces Prowler to help him stop Silvermane, the crime lord fights back, but is defeated by them and left for the police. After a minor appearance in \\"Critical Update\\", during which he was defeated by the Superior Spider-Man, Silvermane appeared in \\"Goblin War, Part 3\\" as the leader of the Goblin King's Cyber Goblins. He fought Spider-Man and Hobgoblin, but gets defeated by the duo. =Video games= * Silvermane appears in the beta versions of the SNES and Sega Genesis Spider-Man video games. However, he was replaced with a robot in the final versions. * Silvermane appears as an exclusive villain in the Nintendo DS version of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, voiced by Steven Blum. Having survived to the year 2099 due to his cybernetic body, he attempted to use a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos to become immortal, only to be defeated by Spider-Man 2099. * Silvermane appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, as part of the \\"Cloak and Dagger\\" DLC. =Novels= Silvermane appears in the novel Spider-Man: Forever Young written by Stefan Petrucha. The details of the tablet story are retold, with some elements being updated or changed, such as Silvermane's disdain for personal electronic devices due to their lack of security as well as the Kingpin being left in a coma due to the shock of learning the Schemer's true identity. The novel includes an original story set two years after the original storyline, with Silvermane now randomly aging from childhood to adulthood as he attempts to force Curt Connors and Spider-Man to retrieve the tablet and find a cure for his condition. Even after Connors's research asserts that the tablet essentially cycles someone through their reincarnations in one lifetime to try and achieve true karma, Silvermane refuses to accept this and attempts to blackmail Spider-Man for aid after deducing his true identity. While Vanessa Fisk also seeks the tablet to help her husband, witnessing what Silvermane has become convinces her to find another way as a confrontation between Vanessa, Silvermane, and Spider-Man in an old church that Silvermane took as his base. The battle ends with Silvermane burning the church down while trying to kill Spider-Man.

The novel tells the story of Anna Komnene, the daughter of Alexios I Komnenos. Plot summary Born a princess of the Byzantine Empire, Anna is the eldest child of Emperor Alexius of the Byzantine Empire and his wife, Irene Ducaena. With only one younger sister, Maria, Anna is her father's chosen successor and she is certain she will inherit the throne upon Alexius' death alongside her betrothed, Constantine Ducas. The emperor's mother and Anna's namesake, Anna Dalassena, is Alexius' most trusted adviser and strongly opposes Irene out of hatred towards the Ducas family for their intrigues. Under her manipulative grandmother, Anna learns statecraft and diplomacy, and Anna excels at all her lessons, becoming a brilliant scholar, and beginning a manuscript that will detail her father's reign. When Anna is five, Irene gives birth to a son, John Porphygenitus. While \\"barbarians\\" from foreign lands believe only a son should ascend to power, Anna is dismissive of their attitudes, as are Alexius and Anna Dalassena. However, as Anna matures into a young woman, her grandmother feels threatened by Anna's arrogance and intelligence, realizing that Anna will not be anyone's puppet. Her grandmother moves swiftly to support John as Alexius' successor, devastating Anna as she sees her dreams of power being taken away and given to her brother. Bitter at her grandmother's betrayal, Anna continues to assert she is the true heir to the throne and waits to avenge herself. Anna's engagement to Constantine Ducas is broken because Constantine dies. She is married off to an older general, Nicephorus Bryennius. As the throne begins to grow further from her reach, Anna pours all her energy into her manuscript. When Alexius dies, John is recognized as the new emperor. Moving to seize what is rightfully hers, Anna conspires with Irene, who remains deeply opposed to Anna Dalassena, to depose John by poisoning him and to install Anna as empress. Anna is furious to find her tutor, Simon, has revealed the conspiracy to John and Anna Dalassena. Out of leniency for his sister and mother, both Anna and Irene are banished to separate convents, never to contact one another, despite Anna Dalassena's demands that both be put to death as examples to the Ducas family. When Anna Dalassena protests that John would not have gotten the throne without her influence, John thanks her for obtaining the throne for him before informing her that he no longer needs her. His words effectively dismiss Anna Dalassena from court, leaving Anna Comnena secretly impressed that her brother will not be a puppet of their grandmother. While she is refused most luxuries at the convent, Anna manages to bring her manuscript, which she has named the Alexiad. Though she reluctantly admits that her brother has demonstrated himself to be a capable ruler thus far, she resolves to finish the Alexiad without mentioning her brother and be remembered for what she accomplished as a scholar.

History It traced its origins to the 12th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, part of the British East India Company's Bombay Army. It fought in the Battle of Khadki on 5 November 1817 in the Third Anglo-Maratha War and became the regiment's 1st Battalion in 1820. It was made a separate regiment in 1824, titled the 23rd Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The regiment took part in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839 and was renamed as the 23rd Regiment of Bombay Native Light Infantry in 1841 . Just before the Indian Mutiny began in 1857, the 23rd took part in the Anglo-Persian War between 1856-1857. During the Indian Mutiny, the regiment remained loyal, like nearly all of the Bombay Army. The regiment took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1879 and the Third Anglo-Burmese War from 1885 to the end of the war in 1887. It dropped \\"native\\" from its title in 1885 and was designated a rifle regiment in 1889, to become the 23rd Regiment (2nd Rifle Regiment) of Bombay Infantry. The 1900s also brought change to its title. The regiment became the 23rd Bombay Rifles in 1901, but only two years later it became the 123rd Outram's Rifles in 1903 as part of the Kitchener reforms of the Indian Army. The renaming was in honour of Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram who had served with the regiment as its first adjutant. In the early 1900s the regiment saw service against Mohammed bin Abdullah (known as the \\"Mad Mullah\\" to the British) and his followers in British Somaliland, where it was transferred in late 1902, while a company was sent to Aden in 1903. =First World War= Sepoys of the 123rd during the campaign in Palestine, 1917 The regiment raised further battalions during the course of the First World War, seeing extensive service in the Middle East, with some soldiers attached to other units. Many of the regiment's soldiers also saw service on the Western Front while attached to other units. After the Palestine campaign began in 1917, the regiment joined the 234th Brigade, 75th Division. Outram's Rifles were involved in, among others, the Third Battle of Gaza, begun on 31 October 1917, and the Megiddo Offensive in September 1918. War came to an end in the Middle East with the signing of an Armistice with the Ottomans on 30 October 1918. =Post-War= After the war ended, the regiment was involved in efforts to quell an Arab rebellion that broke out in 1920 in the British Mandate of Iraq against the British administration. As part of the reforms of the Indian forces, Outram's Rifles were amalgamated in 1922 with five other regiments, including the 125th Napier's Rifles, to form the 6th Rajputana Rifles. The 123rd became the 4th Battalion (Outram's). The 4th Battalion/6th Rajputana Rifles had the distinction of earning two Victoria Crosses during WWII.Sharma 1990, p. 106.

Nobuo Uematsu provided the musical score for King's Knight. It was Uematsu's third work of video game music composition.  Plot  King's Knight follows a basic storyline similar to many NES-era role- playing video games: Princess Claire of Olthea has been kidnapped in the Kingdom of Izander, and the player must choose one of the four heroes (the knight/warrior \\"Ray Jack\\", the wizard \\"Kaliva\\", the monster/gigant \\"Barusa\\" and the (kid) thief \\"Toby\\") to train and set forth to attack Gargatua Castle, defeat the evil dragon Tolfida and rescue the princess.  Gameplay  The player battles enemies in the first stage using Ray Jack. King's Knight is a vertically scrolling shooter, where the main objective is to dodge or destroy all onscreen enemies and obstacles. Various items, however, add depth to the game. As any character, the player can collect various power-ups to increase a character's level (maximum of twenty levels per character): as many as seven Jump Increases, seven Speed Increases, three Weapon Increases, and three Shield Increases. There are also Life Ups, which are collected to increase the character's life meter. There are also Life Downs which should be avoided. Other onscreen icons can affect the stage, such as hidden cave entrances/exits and a \\"secret revealer,\\" which reveals hidden stones that block progress. Finally, there are four types of elements to be collected in each level, which are vital to the completion of the last stage. These elements are simply elements A, B, C, and D. Each stage has various power-ups, an element of each type, and a cave. Because caves in any given level always house at least one element type (not to mention various power-ups), it is vital that the player finds these. Caves are always hidden and are generally found in the middle of a stage. Caves also have statues that shoot fireballs, and at the end of each cave is a dragon to fight. Once the dragon is defeated, the player can exit the cave and continue with the level.  Development and release  = Differences between versions = The MSX version of King's Knight included a sidebar displaying the player's allocated items. Differences were present not only in the Famicom and MSX versions of King's Knight, but in the Japanese and North American versions as well. The Japanese (Famicom) version and the American (NES) version of King's Knight differed little, with the title screen being the only disparity. Each title screen reflected the copyright and publisher. The MSX version of King's Knight differed from the Famicom version in a variety of ways. The opening was modified so that prior to the intro screen, players could specify what type of controller they would like to use (either a keyboard or a joystick). The in-game dynamics were very similar, although some differences exist. In the MSX version, the flanks of the screen were \\"closed off,\\" while the stage maps have moved slightly, and so some of the items appear to be out of their original locations. Finally, the MSX version may seem easier, because the characters can sustain more damage from attacks. The developers also took advantage of technological capabilities available on the MSX. As an upgrade, the MSX port featured more sound channels than the Famicom, and as such many music tracks and sound effects were altered or improved. The MSX version also boasts a wider range of colors, updated graphics, new monster and boss designs (dragons at the end of caves, for example, were replaced with reptilian monsters), and a new sidebar, which displayed the player's life meter, allocated power-ups, and allocated elements. The MSX could not smoothly render vertical scrolling though ‚Äì unlike the Famicom ‚Äì so the movement of the graphics is very \\"choppy\\" in comparison. Some of these changes are very similar to the changes that took place when Square's Final Fantasy was ported to the MSX2.  Remake  On September 18, 2016, Square Enix announced a remake titled King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon for iOS and Android. It was produced by Daisuke Motohashi and developed by Flame Hearts. Developed as a mobile spin-off associated with Final Fantasy XV, the game borrows the original version's scrolling, action role-playing game style and adds a new camera perspective and an orchestral version of the former's chiptune soundtrack. The game is free-to-play with a four-player multiplayer mode. Square Enix announced the game at the September 2016 Tokyo Game Show. Its promotional material placed the game in the Final Fantasy XV universe alongside Justice Monsters Five, another mobile companion game to the series that Square Enix announced earlier in 2016. King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon was planned for release on Android and iOS platforms in Japan in 2016, with no announcement for a North American release. The game's release was then postponed to 2017. It was released worldwide on September 13, 2017. End of service was subsequently announced for the game to take place June 26, 2018https://twitter.com/FFXVEN/status/978074206352166913 \\\\- less than a year after its worldwide release.  Other media  King's Knight is one of the video games to be adapted into a manga titled , published in the Gamest Comics collection from April 1999, and drawn by Kouta Hirano.  Reception  King's Knight was given a 3/10 on IGN and 3/10 as well on Nintendo Life.

She was born in Nyack, New York, moved around throughout childhood from NY to the midwest and back, graduating from senior high school in Severna Park, Maryland before college at Wartburg College in Iowa. Self-taught as a child, she starting at the approximate age of 4 years old on the piano, began busking music in junior high school, getting bar gigs before she even graduated. She lived in Baltimore for the majority of the 1980s and became a fixture at many local clubs in the Baltimore, DC, VA, PA circuit and beyond as she began to build her national touring schedule. Suede's popularity steadily increased and she began playing sold-out shows in some of the US's most respected concert halls and jazz clubs (Birdland, Feinsteins, Kennedy Center, Birchmere, etc.), sharing the stage with fellow headliners such as Melissa Etheridge and Sarah McLachlan, and opening for Janis Ian and Joan Rivers, among others. She began her own record/touring label in 1983, Easily Suede Music, and has toured consistently nationally and internationally since. She currently has 4 CDs and 1 DVD released on the Easily Suede label. Her DVD \\"Suede, Live at Scullers Jazz Club\\" aired on 54 stations nationally as part of the PBS fund-drive. Her recording of Shirley Eikhard's song \\"Emily Remembers\\" became the #1 song of the year on WJZW Radio, Washington, DC. Each of her recordings have sold upwards of 10,000 copies with national distribution and airplay. Suede successfully sued the Sony Corporation in 1993 for trademark violation for introducing and representing a British band named \\"Suede\\" in the US without doing a required preliminary trademark check with the Library of Congress. The two parties reached a settlement, after two years in legal process, resulting in an agreement that the band's albums would only be promoted and sold in the US under the name \\"The London Suede.\\" In addition to being a vocalist, Suede plays multiple instruments; trumpet, piano, and guitar and is well known for her humor and quick wit in her live shows. She currently lives on Cape Cod. Suede also toured for 2 years with The Flirtations, seen in the Jonathan Demme film \\"Philadelphia\\" and was on the group's final album, Three.

It begins at the border between Westchester County and the Bronx, as the continuation of the Henry Hudson Parkway leaving New York City, and heads generally northeastward to an interchange with Interstate 684 (I-684). At its north end, the parkway serves as a collector/distributor road as it passes east of the hamlet of Katonah. The parkway is named for the Saw Mill River, which the highway parallels for most of its length. The Saw Mill serves as an important connection from the Taconic State and Sprain Brook parkways to the Tappan Zee Bridge and New York State Thruway. It is a limited-access highway, but not a controlled-access highway as several of its exits are signalized at-grade intersections. The Saw Mill River Parkway is inventoried by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as New York State Route 987D (NY 987D), an unsigned reference route designation. Route description =Yonkers to Elmsford= The Saw Mill River Parkway begins at the Bronx‚ÄìWestchester line in Van Cortlandt Park as a continuation of the Henry Hudson Parkway. The Saw Mill River winds northward and parallels a former railroad grade into Yonkers. Now in the Southeast Yonkers section, southbound there is a ramp to McLean Avenue. Passing Tibbetts Lake, the Saw Mill River winds northward alongside the railroad grade as a four-lane roadway as it enters exit 4, which serves as the western terminus of the Cross County Parkway. Immediately after the Cross County, exit 5 forks off on a 180-degree turn for Yonkers Avenue and nearby Dunwoodie Golf Course. The parkway becomes at-grade after exit 5, entering exit 5A, which services Palmer Road in Northwest Yonkers. Winding northward through Yonkers, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters exit 7, a ramp to NY 9A and Tuckahoe Road via Rossiter Avenue. After exit 7, the parkway begins paralleling the namesake river and NY 9A, now known as Saw Mill River Road, near the Runyon Heights neighborhood. The railroad grade returns near Odell Avenue overpass on the northbound side. Upon entering exit 9, the parkway enters a series of signaled at-grade interchanges. The first is exit 9, which serves Executive Boulevard in Yonkers. This is followed by Hearst Street at exit 10 and Tompkins Avenue at exit 11\\\\. Just north of exit 11, the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses the city line and enters the town of Hastings-on-Hudson. In Hastings-on-Hudson, the Saw Mill River enters exit 12, an at-grade interchange with the terminus of the Farragut Parkway. The Ashford Avenue interchange (exit 17) in Dobbs Ferry The next exit, designated exit 13, is a non-traffic light intersection with Farragut Avenue on both sides of the highway. The four-lane parkway winds north through Hastings-on-Hudson, passing through several suburban sections of town. Keeping in close contact with NY 9A, the Saw Mill River and the railroad grade, exit 14 splits off southbound at Clarence Avenue. Exit 15 also forks off southbound at an intersection with Cliff Street before the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses into Dobbs Ferry. Upon entering Dobbs Ferry, the parkway enters an intersection with Lawrence Street (exit 16) and creeping closer to the New York State Thruway (I-87). In Dobbs Ferry, the parkway enters exit 17, the first full interchange since Tuckahoe Road, connecting to Ashford Avenue and NY 9A. Continuing northbound through Dobbs Ferry, the southbound parkway enters an intersection with Cyrus Field Road before crossing into Irvington. Through Irvington, the Saw Mill River Parkway parallels the Thruway and the river before turning northeast and crossing into Greenburgh and exit 20\\\\. Exit 20 serves the New York State Thruway northbound via a flyover ramp. After exit 20, the Saw Mill River Parkway proceeds northeast on a parallel of NY 9A. Continuing alongside the namesake river, the parkway leaves Greenburgh for Elmsford, entering exit 21E and exit 21W, which services NY 119 (Main Street) via separate ramps. After a dart to the northwest, the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses under the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287). While there is no ramp northbound, exit 22 forks southbound to the westbound Cross Westchester. =Elmsford to Katonah= Crossing back into Greenburgh, the Saw Mill River Parkway continues northwest away from the Saw Mill River. After turning northbound, the parkway enters the Eastview section of Greenburgh, reaching exit 23, which serves Saw Mill Road and Neperan Road. Exit 23 is the only interchange in Greenburgh as the parkway proceeds into the town of Mount Pleasant. In Mount Pleasant, the parkway enters exit 25 northbound, a small ramp to NY 9A (Saw Mill River Road). Crossing over the Saw Mill River once again, the parkway winds northeast into exit 26 near an overpass of NY 9A and NY 100 (Saw Mill River Road). Exit 26, just to the east of NY 9A/NY 100, services the Taconic State Parkway, Bronx River Parkway and Sprain Brook Parkway in the center of Graham Hills County Park via several flyover ramps. Just to the southeast of the interchange is the Hawthorne Metro-North Railroad station. The Saw Mill River Parkway approaching exit 30, Grant Street, in Pleasantville The Saw Mill River Parkway crosses northeast through Graham Hills County Park, paralleling the Harlem Line and NY 141 through Mount Pleasant. The parkway passes west of the former Thornwood station before turning northwest and away from NY 141\\\\. Just after the turn, exit 27 comes at-grade, a junction with Marble Avenue, which connects to NY 141\\\\. The parkway runs along a short westbound stretch, crossing into the village of Pleasantville. Going northward in Pleasantville, exit 28 forks off northbound only to Bedford Road, which connects to downtown Pleasantville. Proceeding southbound, exit 29 accesses NY 117 (Pleasantville Road). The parkway turns northeast and enters exit 30 for Grant Street near the Pleasantville Metro-North station. The Saw Mill River Parkway and the Harlem Line parallel once again in the northern reaches of Pleasantville, paralleling the Saw Mill River into the town of New Castle. Now in the hamlet of Chappaqua, exit 32 southbound accesses NY 120 at Mill River Road. Nearby this junction is the Chappaqua Metro-North station. After crossing under NY 120, the northbound exit 32 connects to Hunts Place, which connects to NY 120\\\\. Running along a hillside in New Castle, the parkway becomes a divided highway for a short distance, becoming a two-lane roadway northbound. No interchange is present along this stretch and the lanes come back together just south of exit 33, an at-grade intersection with Readers Digest Road. At this interchange, the parkway has access to the former Global Headquarters of Reader's Digest and nearby NY 117. From lower left to top center, the Saw Mill River Parkway skirts the west edge of Mount Kisco before joining Interstate 684 near Katonah. (Aerial view, 2013) The parkway continues northeast through the town of New Castle, passing northwest of the Mount Kisco Country Club before entering the village of Mount Kisco. Just southwest of the Mount Kisco Metro-North station, the parkway and railroad fork in different directions, with the parkway turning north into exit 34, an at-grade interchange with NY 133 (West Main Street). In the northern reaches of Mount Kisco, exit 36 services Croton Avenue from the southbound lanes. Just to the north, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters exit 37, a junction with Kisco Avenue and nearby Pines Bridge Road (unsigned County Route 1323). Now in the town of Bedford, the parkway enters exit 38, two separate at-grade intersections for Green Lane. Green Lane is also the last at-grade intersection on the Saw Mill River Parkway northbound. Crossing south of Bedford Hills Memorial Park, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters the hamlet of Bedford Hills. In Bedford Hills, the parkway enters exit 39, which connects to the hamlet and NY 117 (Bedford Road). Also present at this interchange is the Bedford Hills Metro-North station. The parkway divides once again through Bedford Hills, paralleling NY 117 through the community. The parkway then enters exit 42, an interchange for NY 117 and Railroad Avenue. At Harris Road, NY 117 crosses over the parkway, paralleling the northbound lanes of the Saw Mill River Parkway on a nearby bypass. NY 117 soon merges into the Saw Mill River Parkway (exit 43 southbound) before the Saw Mill River Parkway enters the right-of-way for Interstate 684, where the parkway terminates just east of Katonah. History Former restaurant, served early motorists Flooded Saw Mill River Parkway after Hurricane Irene The Saw Mill Parkway started construction in 1926. By 1930, it had reached Route 119 in Elmsford. Construction had only reached Chappaqua by 1940 when World War II halted any further progress. The Saw Mill Parkway was constructed along the Saw Mill River along with a sewer which was to both drain sewage from Yonkers and act as flood control for points north. The full length of the parkway was opened in 1955. The Parkway once fed into the accident-prone Hawthorne Circle, a former roundabout at the intersection of the Taconic Parkway extension from the Bronx River Parkway, Taconic State, and Saw Mill River parkways. In 1972 the circle was rebuilt as a three-level interchange. NYSDOT has maintained the Saw Mill River Parkway since 1980, after abolition of the East Hudson Parkway Authority. Under NYSDOT, the 25¬¢ toll between exits 3 and 4, which was originally implemented by Westchester County in 1936, was removed on October 31, 1994, with the last tour just before midnight. The tolls were abolished on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways in November 1994. From October 1990 into the Summer of 1992, NYSDOT built the Katonah Bypass and converted the segment between there and Interstate 684 into an overlap with part of a realigned NY 117.987D RAMP TO 117 over RTE 987D; Westchester County, New York (UglyBridges.com) Exit list See also  References External links * Saw Mill River Parkway Service Stations (Hudson River Valley Ruins) Category:Parkways in New York (state) Category:Robert Moses projects Category:Transportation in Westchester County, New York Category:Former toll roads in New York (state) ","title":"Saw Mill River Parkway"},{"id":"2177880","text":"The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (codified at ) was an act of Congress passed on October 30, 1984 to promote competition and deregulate the cable television industry. The act established a national policy for the regulation of cable television communications by federal, state, and local authorities. Conservative Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona wrote and supported the act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 with the insertion of \\"Title VI‚ÄîCable Communications\\". After more than three years of debate, six provisions were enacted to represent the intricate compromise between cable operators and municipalities. Provisions The scholarly article, \\"Perceived Impact of the Cable Policy Act of 1984,\\" published in the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media in 1987, described its objective as follows: > The new law attempted to strike a delicate balance between the FCC, local > governments, and marketplace competition, where in the past, each of these > entities had vied for dominance. The Cable Act was to be the solution to the > ongoing problem of who, or what, should exercise the most power over local > cable operations. In order to balance power between cable television operators and the government, the act established regulations regarding franchise standards and proceeds that would attempt to strengthen the development of cable systems. The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations. By establishing an orderly process for franchise renewal, the act protected cable operators from unfair denials of renewal. However, in order to be granted a franchise renewal, the act specified that cable operators' past performances and future proposals had to meet the federal standards in the new title. The act was meant to reduce an unnecessary regulation that could have potentially brought about an excessive economic burden on cable systems. In return for establishing franchise standards and procedures, the act specified that cable operators were expected to be receptive to their local communities' needs and interests. Congress recognized the vital role of cable television in encouraging and providing a place for free expression. This provision assured that cable communications provide the general public with \\"the widest possible diversity of information sources and services.\\" Through this statute, Congress attempted to uphold the First Amendment interest of cable audiences to receive diversified information as specified in the Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission court case of 1969. This provision declared that state and local authorities should allow, but not mandate, that this type of information be distributed via non-commercial Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels. Furthermore, it prohibited cable operators from exerting any type of editorial control over program content broadcast through PEG channels and freed them from any potential liability for the content. The act lifted programming rules and subscription fees. It was this provision that inspired Senator Barry Goldwater to begin his work on the Cable Communications Act of 1984. Structure The Cable Communication Act of 1984 added \\"Title VI‚ÄîCable Communications\\" to the Communications Act of 1934. The title was originally divided into the following sections: * Part I‚ÄîGeneral Provisions ** Sec. 601. Purposes. ** Sec. 602. Definitions. * Part II‚ÄîUse of Cable Channels and Ownership Restrictions ** Sec. 611. Cable channels for public, educational, or government use. ** Sec. 612. Cable channels for commercial use. ** Sec. 613. Ownership restrictions. * Part III‚ÄîFranchising and Regulation ** Sec. 621. General franchise requirements. ** Sec. 622. Franchise fees. ** Sec. 623. Regulation of rates. ** Sec. 624. Regulation of services, facilities, and equipment. ** Sec. 625. Modification of franchise obligations. ** Sec. 626. Renewal. ** Sec. 627. Conditions of sale. * Part IV‚ÄîMiscellaneous Provisions ** Sec. 631. Protection of subscriber privacy. ** Sec. 632. Consumer protection. ** Sec. 633. Unauthorized reception of cable service. ** Sec. 634. Equal employment opportunity. ** Sec. 635. Judicial proceedings. ** Sec. 636. Coordination of Federal, State, and local authority. ** Sec. 637. Existing franchises. ** Sec. 638. Criminal and civil liability. ** Sec. 639. Obscene programming. History In 1972, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued the Third Report and Order. The order was enacted to encourage consumer choice and innovation among video devices. The regulations adopted in the order established requirements for broadband, cellular, and wireline Personal Communications Services (PCS) carriers in compliance with the assistance capability requirements prescribed by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. The FCC hoped that the newly adopted regulations would generate a competitive marketplace for various devices capable of accessing cable video services by allowing consumers to purchase smart video devices that were compatible with all multichannel video programming services. This would allow consumers the freedom to change service providers without changing their entertainment devices. The \\"Third Report and Order\\" resulted in the top 100 U.S. television markets providing three Public- access television channels, each for Public-access television, Educational- access, or Government-access television (GATV) (PEG) use. If demand was low for all three channels in a specific market, cable companies had the jurisdiction to supply fewer channels. At least one PEG channel was required at all times. Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ), the sponsor of the act. In 1976, the regulation was expanded to include cable television systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers. Cable companies saw the regulation by the federal government as an unlawful intrusion into their business practices and immediately started to challenge its legality. In the court case United States v. Midwest Video Corp., the Midwest Video Corporation sued the FCC for overstepping its authority in requiring Public-access television channels. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's requirements for local origination facilities. However, in 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Midwest Video Corp. stating that the FCC's new requirements exceeded the agency's statutory powers as granted to them by Congress and as required by cable operators to provide Public-access television. The FCC was interfering with the agency's First Amendment rights. After the Supreme Court's decision, PEG advocates started work on what became the Cable Communications Act of 1984. The need for an act to determine who holds regulatory authority for cable communications was quite evident, however it took time to reach an agreement. Negotiations for the act lasted nearly two years and agreements moved back and forth between the House and the Senate. The two parties involved in the negotiations were the National League of Cities (NLC) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), formerly the National Cable Television Association. These parties worked to lobby Congress for their respective members, who represented diverse populations and had firm, unyielding interests. Instead of having Congress determine the outcome of a stalemate, the two organizations tried to present a unified front. This was a strategic move meant to increase the likelihood that the bill would be passed in both the House and the Senate. The act began as bill S. 66 in the Senate where it was passed on June 14, 1983 and moved on to the House. The companion bill, H.R. 4103, in the House was passed on October 1, 1984 and returned to the Senate where modifications were made to conjoin the texts. The bill was officially passed on October 11, 1984 and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1984. During negotiations, the agreements were voided four times. The National League of Cities (NLC) voided agreements three times because cable companies were freed from rate regulation, given renewal expectancy, and could default on promises in certain circumstances. On the other hand, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NTCA) voided agreements once because they felt that another Supreme Court ruling would provide the industry with better rate deregulation than under the present FCC regulations or the bill. Outcomes and debates The result of the act was an intricate, minimally influential agreement between cable operators and municipalities. It has been highly debated for its effectiveness, because evidence shows that unaffiliated television programming on leased access channels was avoided and rarely appeared. As a title of the larger Communications Act of 1934, the Cable Communications Act of 1984 has been amended and revised with the Cable Act of 1992, also referred to as Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Cable Communications Act of 1984 had minimal advantages, because it was enacted around a strong legislative agreement between the demands of cable operators and the demands of the public. During the negotiation process, there was relatively little public participation, meaning cable consumers and public, educational, and government access (PEG) advocates were left vulnerable to cable operators' enforcement and decisions. There was dramatic growth in the cable industry once the act went into effect. However, it remained largely in the hands of few local monopolies that were able to determine the content of the programs and set the rates for services and channels on their system. These changes in authority were not immediate, but evolved over the course of a few years. Cable consumers were outraged with the increases in prices and services, whereas municipalities were annoyed with violated contracts. Many of these outcomes can be attributed to the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) interpretation of Congress' mandates, which contained poor choice of language and confusion over the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Cable consumers' complaints about the outcomes led to policy discussions in the late eighties and early nineties in which public interest was considered but not represented. If monopolies were broken apart and competition was restored, then many of the problems would likely be resolved. Cable operators would not refuse to carry programs and services with popular demand, and prices would return to appropriate and economical rates. In order to address this problem, the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992 was passed to regulate cable television rates that cable operators charged consumers. The law, intending to grant privileges to local community members by allowing them to require PEG channels also allowed these municipalities to decide against PEG requirements. In franchise agreements, contracted between cable operators and municipalities, the municipality could specify a PEG channel requirement and later opt out of these channels, keeping the cable television franchise fees for their general fund and supplying their communities with no PEG outlets or channel capacity. Since its approval, many public-access television centers have closed as a result of the opt-out provision. Since the act prevented cable operators from regulating publicly generated content, much controversy developed around what was allowed to appear on these channels. A public-access television center in Eau Claire, Wisconsin was faulted for televising a video created by Christian Bangert, a man convicted of murdering a city police officer. The tape was shown repeatedly during Bangert's trial, and many people felt its airing was in bad taste. Across the country, controversial content such as explicit sex and promotion of Nazi groups have aired via PEG channels. Congress, in an attempt to protect viewers from indecent programming, passed the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which allowed the FCC to establish rules requiring cable operators to prohibit particular shows. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the law was unconstitutional claiming that cable operators should never be required to act on behalf of the federal government to control expression in relation to content. Commercial leased access did not provide cable subscribers with a diversity of information as it was required, because it was avoided and never mandated by local franchising authority. In the 1998 court case Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC, the court deemed the act ineffective in terms of unaffiliated programming. \\"The 1984 legislation did not accomplish much. Unaffiliated programming on leased channels rarely appeared.\\" The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act reinforced its intent that leased access to provide a diversity of information to subscribers as determined by the cable operators. The Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC court also upheld the provision mentioned above.

The film, written by George A. Romero and John A. Russo, primarily focuses on a group of people gathering at a farmhouse to survive from an onslaught of zombies in rural Pennsylvania. It is known to have inspired the modern interpretation of zombies as reanimated human corpses that feast on the flesh and/or brains of the living. Due to a copyright error during its release, Night of the Living Deads status in the public domain has resulted in numerous works claiming to expand upon or spin off from the plot points and characters of the film, sometimes without the involvement of the original cast and crew members. They consist of various films, literature, and other forms of media that explore the outbreak and evolution of a zombie apocalypse and society's reaction to it. The two most notable are Romero's Dead series, consisting of five additional films, and the Return of the Living Dead series, which was loosely based on Russo's novel of the same name.  George A. Romero's Dead series  As of its latest installment, Survival of the Dead, Romero's Dead series includes six films all written and directed by Romero himself. Labeled Trilogy of the Dead until Land of the Dead, each film is laden with social commentary on topics ranging from racism to consumerism. The films are not produced as direct follow-ups from one another, and the only continuation is the epidemic of the living dead. This situation advances with each film, but with different characters, and the time moves ahead to the time when they were filmed, making the world's progression the only interlocking aspect of the series. The fifth film does not continue the depiction of the progress of the world; instead it goes back to the beginning of events from the first film, but is nonetheless contemporary as the sequels are. The films deal with how different people react to the same phenomenon ranging from citizens to police to army officials and back again. There are no real happy endings to the films, as each takes place in a world that has gotten worse since the last time we saw it, the number of zombies ever increasing and the fate of the living remnant always in the balance. Romero tried to make each movie unique from the previous, but this led to some of his more serious works, like Day of the Dead, receiving a worse reception compared to his spoof-like film Dawn of the Dead. He explained this in an interview with Telegraph film reviewer Tim Robey saying, \\"You know, I‚Äôve made six zombie films, I‚Äôve tried consciously to make each one different from the next. But that‚Äôs not what people want these days. They want the same thing! I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs part of this television mentality, where people tune in every week to see the same thing.\\". Romero does not consider any of his Dead films sequels since none of the major characters or story continue from one film to the next. The one exception is that the military officer from Diary of the Dead (Alan van Sprang), who robs the main characters, is a main character in Survival of the Dead as well. George A. Romero's Dead series includes: # Night of the Living Dead (1968) # Dawn of the Dead (1978) # Day of the Dead (1985) # Land of the Dead (2005) # Diary of the Dead (2007) # Survival of the Dead (2009)  Dead series remakes  Remakes have been made for two of the original films with the involvement of some of the original cast and crew members: = Night of the Living Dead (1990) = Directed by Tom Savini, former special make-up effects artist, who worked on Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead while George A. Romero rewrote the screenplay. The plot of the film follows closely the 1968 original, where Barbara, Ben, the Cooper family and Tom Landry and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson are trapped in a rural farmhouse in Pennsylvania trying to survive the night while the house is being attacked by mysteriously reanimated ghouls, otherwise known as zombies. = Dawn of the Dead (2004) = Directed by Zack Snyder. A group of strangers: Ana, Police Sergeant Kenneth Hall, Michael, Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda, break into a nearby mall where they are confronted by three living guards ‚Äì C.J., Bart and Terry ‚Äì who make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. The group secures the mall, then heads to the roof where they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded alone in his gun store, across the zombie-infested parking lot. The next day more survivors arrive at the mall and are let in. After some of the survivors start dying from zombie attacks and any hope of being rescued gone, the group decides to fight their way to the Milwaukee marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan.  Dan O'Bannon and John Russo's Living Dead spin-offs  There are currently two distinct franchises utilizing the Living Dead moniker. The first was Return of the Living Dead, which originated as a novel written in 1978 by John A. Russo. It was later adapted to a film by Dan O'Bannon, which spawned its own series of movies, with a total of four sequels. This could be seen more as a spinoff of Night of the Living Dead rather than sequels, as the first movie treats Night of the Living Dead as a movie that was based on real events. Russo and producer Tom Fox planned to bring Return of the Living Dead to the screen offering O'Bannon the director's seat, he accepted on the condition he could rewrite the film radically so as to differentiate it from Romero's films. O'Bannon discarded Russo's script in its entirety and rewrote it, retaining only the title and changing the \\"rules\\" significantly. His alterations to the canon include the zombies' fixation on brains alone (whereas Romero/Russo zombies will devour any part of a living human), the ability to move rapidly and communicate (despite physical defects that would render such activity impossible), and the ability of 2‚Äì4‚Äì5 Trioxin to resurrect any deceased life form, regardless of how long the decedent has been interred. Although Russo and O'Bannon were only directly involved with the first film in the series, the rest of the films, to varying degrees, stick to their outline and \\"rules\\" established in the first film. Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead series includes: #The Return of the Living Dead (O'Bannon, 1985) #Return of the Living Dead Part II (Ken Wiederhorn, 1988) #Return of the Living Dead 3 (Brian Yuzna, 1993) #Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis (Ellory Elkayem, 2005) #Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave (Ellory Elkayem, 2005) Then, in 1998, Russo went back to the original Night of the Living Dead to reshoot extra sequences into the film. This version, which was officially named Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition, added a subplot, alternate opening, and new score. Russo followed this with another Living Dead film, Children of the Living Dead. #Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition (Russo, 1998) #Children of the Living Dead (Karen L. Wolf, 2001) Romero's vs. O'Bannon's zombies While the two kinds are similar in appearance, there are certain distinguishing details: =Infection= Romero's original Night of the Living Dead explains that an unknown phenomenon causes re-animation of the brain. Instead of being spread from person to person, the phenomenon presents itself in any human that has recently died from any cause (except those that destroy the physical structure of the brain). The first animated corpses appear in many locations simultaneously, quickly reaching pandemic levels. Characters speculate about the cause of the phenomenon; suggestions at various times include a spaceborne virus, divine punishment, radiation from a satellite returning from Venus, or that \\"there's no more room in Hell\\". While bites from these reanimated creatures are uniformly lethal, by mechanics unknown, death by other means would have the same result, so a bite is not necessary. It is suggested in Day of the Dead that the immediate amputation of bitten limbs may prevent victims from dying, but while the treatment is attempted, its success is never conclusively demonstrated. In George Romero's original Day of the Dead idea, a person was to have his bitten arm amputated, but still return as a zombie. Survival of the Dead shows that, in the rare instance of a living person biting the undead, that person will become infected. Many characters in films (including George Romero himself) have referred to the bitten area as the \\"infected area\\" or an \\"infection\\". The state of zombification seen in O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead series is induced by the chemical compound Trioxin, an extremely toxic substance found in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure. Depending on the film in the series, Trioxin zombies may or may not be able to contaminate living humans with Trioxin via bite. Very small amounts of Trioxin are sufficient to have full effect, and bodies need not be fresh to be re-animated. Both factors were illustrated in the first two films, wherein Trioxin seeped through several feet of earth to reach graves several decades old and animate the occupants (The Return of the Living Dead even depicted a near-skeleton coming out of its grave). If a zombie corpse is stored for too long in a sealed container, the decomposition process will generate noxious gases containing trace amounts of Trioxin, so the drum can only be safely opened in a sealed lab environment. The requirement of Trioxin exposure makes containment to a specific area or group of people somewhat easier than Romero's plague (though the extreme tenacity of the zombies may mitigate this advantage). =Memory= Romero's zombies have very limited to no memory of their previous life. But they all remember how to walk, and how to use their hands for several tasks (such as striking or holding something or someone). They recognize many objects such as cars, houses and other structures, and they recognize the doors in order to enter them. As characters state in Dawn of the Dead, the zombies are in the mall since it was \\"an important place in their lives\\". They also kept the instinct of eating and biting. In Day of The Dead, the zombie dubbed 'Bub' is experimented on and trained by the scientist Logan and recalls how to use a razor, a telephone, and a book. When Capt. Rhodes walks in the room, Bub salutes him, fires an unloaded pistol at him, and later in the movie shoots Capt. Rhodes. In Land of the Dead, the undead retained some memory of their past lives, allowing them to use tools they remember operating, and even display emotion, giving some of Bub's intelligence to other zombies. The zombies in the Return of the Living Dead series retain their full memories as of their time of death, whether or not they were reanimated immediately or after long interment. =Intelligence= Romero's zombies initially lack full cognitive function and act only on a single drive: the need to seek and consume living flesh. Night of the Living Dead depicted zombies eating animals as well as humans. The zombies have no true physiological need for flesh, nor can their expired digestive organs derive sustenance from it at all. This was discovered by Dr. Logan (nicknamed \\"Frankenstein\\") during his many experiments on \\"living\\" zombie specimens and reported to Sarah in Day of the Dead. The animated dead retain vague impulses derived from former living behavior. For instance, zombies often return to specific locations they frequented when alive (examples from the original Dawn of the Dead, hordes of zombies are compelled to congregate in a shopping mall, and one zombie knows where to find the secret hideout containing its still-living former companions). Lacking immediate victims to hunt, zombies will often fumble through crude motions reminiscent of life activities, often when prompted by a familiar artifact such as a telephone or car. With stimulus, it is possible for some specimens to begin to remember more of the common activities they performed while alive and achieve a basic functioning intelligence. In Day of the Dead, the zombie nicknamed Bub was \\"educated\\" into docility by Dr. Logan, learned (or remembered) how to operate a handgun and even developed a childlike affection for its instructor. In Land of the Dead, the zombie known as Big Daddy developed sophisticated cognitive function on his own, felt affection and empathy for his fellow zombies (even putting some out of their misery when they were injured), could teach other zombies how to use objects (including weapons) and devised crude strategies for bypassing the defenses of the living humans who had destroyed many of his fellows. The more intelligent zombies like Bub and Big Daddy retain their hunger for living human flesh, but can put off immediate gratification if doing so offers a chance for a more significant reward later. In O'Bannon's universe, if bodies are still in good condition when they are reanimated, then the resulting zombies really are capable of the same things as normal living humans. Basically, they are like normal humans but with an uncontrollable need to eat brains, which ease the great and constant pain felt from their own decomposition. Depending on their own intelligence, from the previous life, they can actually resist their need for eating brains to the benefit of survival and to elaborate some \\"brain-hunting\\" tactics. For instance, a rotten, half-melted zombie dubbed \\"Tarman\\" desperately tries to pull down a closet door with a winch in order to catch one of the protagonists, Tina, his intended victim. He fails to get Tina, but manages to eat one of her friends who comes to her rescue. This also goes as far as posing as a normal living human (like a cop signaling cars to stop on the side) or calling friends or other people and asking them for help, basically anything to attract and trap new living fresh brains when they get close enough. It is also worth noting that, as seen in Return of the Living Dead Part 2, these zombies will act communally, for example waiting to open a gate for all the other zombies rather than simply taking the brains for themselves. =Locomotion= Romero's zombies are slow and shambling. In interviews, George Romero has attributed this quality to rigor mortis, and to the poor condition of their ankles. A sheriff in Night of the Living Dead sagely suggests that their limited mobility is due to the fact that \\"they're dead, they're...all messed up.\\" In Diary of the Dead (2007, post Dawn of the Dead remake) the director of the student horror film tells his living dead actor (a mummy, in this case) not to move quickly because \\"if you run that fast your ankles are going to snap off.\\" When that character later becomes an actual zombie and shambles after a victim the director says \\"See? I told you dead things move slow!\\" The cemetery zombie in Night of the Living Dead and the two zombie children in Dawn of the Dead (1978) are the only running zombies in the series. O'Bannon's Trioxin-contaminated zombies can run if not physically injured and display quite normal mobility if not too decomposed. They have the added advantage of remaining mobile even if significant body mass is lost. Several times, zombies who have lost their legs remain agile and quick through the use of their arms. =Speech= In Romero's series, zombies never get much beyond basic grunts and groans or even screams. The aforementioned zombie Bub makes a praiseworthy effort to say \\"Hello Aunt Alicia,\\" but the result is largely incomprehensible. Big Daddy in Land of the Dead was able to crudely laugh after finding a jackhammer. In the Return of the Living Dead series, a zombie can speak normally (even if its lungs, trachea, and facial muscles are largely missing) but it tends to only be one word (\\"brains!\\") or any real conversation will tend to lean towards their attraction to the listener's brain, how good it must taste and the speaker's overwhelming desire to consume it. There is a glaring exception to this in Return of the Living Dead 3, involving a very fresh corpse that had not even been buried yet. =Termination= The only way a Romero zombie can die is if its brain is destroyed. Zombies can also be burned as shown in Night of the Living Dead. A zombie's mobility may be hampered by structural damage, but such damage will do nothing to reduce the \\"life force\\" driving the body. Body parts severed from an undead brain will become inanimate. Simply removing the head does not kill the zombie; the head would remain alive, as shown in Day of the Dead. In contrast, a typical O'Bannon zombie simply cannot be deactivated short of complete destruction. Any severed body parts will still remain animate, resulting in two or more moving parts. Therefore, decapitation produces both an animate head and an animate body wandering around still trying to catch a living human. There are only two known ways to permanently kill a zombie. One is completely burning the body (as seen in the cremation scene from The Return of the Living Dead), though burning the body releases Trioxin-laced smoke into the air, which can combine with clouds to create Trioxin-laced rain. Another way is electrocuting the undead until they cease to move or squirm (see Return of the Living Dead Part II). In the third film scientists invented an endothermic chemical dart that freezes the brain, incapacitating the zombie, but its effective duration is wildly unpredictable. This zombie endurance is nevertheless contradicted in both the fourth and fifth films in the series, where the zombies are easily destroyed by attack, including attacks that do not damage the brain. Another discontinuity within the O'Bannon series is that, in the fourth film, the zombies do not seem to be capable of running, as they tend to move as slow as the zombies in the Romero series.  Unauthorized sequels and remakes  There are also some other films that have been released as sequels to various films in Romero's Dead series, most likely to ride on the name recognition that Romero's films enjoy. They have been produced due to the various mix-ups with the copyright and ownership of the movies, Romero himself owns only Dawn of the Dead from his first four films. Romero is often positive towards derivations of his work, stating that any new film in the horror genre is a step forward, whether completely original or a 'copycat'. = Zombi 2 (1979) = Directed by Lucio Fulci. Also known as Zombie in the U.S. and as Zombie Flesh Eaters in the U.K. The film that was already in production when Dawn of the Dead was released, but was renamed to be a sequel upon its release (Dawn of the Dead was titled Zombi in Italy). This movie has a history of official and unofficial sequels itself (see Zombi series). = Day of the Dead 2: Contagium (2005) = Directed by Ana Clavell and James Dudelson. While billed as a sequel to Day of the Dead, as Taurus Entertainment Company holds the original's copyright, it has no actual ties to the original Day of the Dead or the series (although the prologue is set in Pittsburgh 1968). Taurus Entertainment Company eventually announced plans in August 2009 to produce a sequel, with a working title- turned-official title, Day of the Dead: Epidemic, which is set to be the third installment of the series. = Night of the Living Dead 3D (2006) = Directed by Jeff Broadstreet. The film is a remake/reimagining of the original film made in a 3D format. The original's status as public domain made it possible to produce this film without the involvement of either Romero or Russo. = Day of the Dead (2008) = Directed by Steve Miner, the story is located in Leadville, Colorado, where the couple of Trevor (Michael Welch) and Nina (AnnaLynne McCord) find themselves in a town suddenly sealed off by military forces (Mena Suvari, Ving Rhames and Nick Cannon). People begin acting strangely and the dead come back to life, with the couple and the soldiers trying to escape. = Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation (2012) = This film is a sequel to Night of the Living Dead 3D and is not the same as Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated (2009) , which is an animated film using various techniques to retell the story of the original film. = Day of the Dead: Bloodline (2018) = In January 2018, a second reimagining of Day of the Dead was released, titled Day of the Dead: Bloodline. Parodies There have also been ultra-low budget parodies such as: =Night of the Living Bread (1990)= Directed by Kevin S. O'Brien. A parody of the original film, where a satellite crashes to Earth bringing radiation that promptly animates ‚Äì as opposed to re-animating ‚Äì all manner of homicidal bread, from buns to biscuits to Communion wafers. =Night of the Day of the Dawn [...] (1991)= Night of the Day of the Dawn is the shortened title of a parody created by James Riffel, which is the classic Night of the Living Dead film with redubbed comedic dialogue and some new clips. The complete title of the movie is: Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2. =Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2006)= Directed by Lloyd Kaufman. After a fictional fried chicken franchise opens a restaurant on the location of an Indian burial ground, the chicken corpses come to life, wreaking havoc on the site =Night of the Loving Dead (2013)= Directed by J.F. Kinyon. A short-film parody of the original George Romero film, a zombie attacks a couple in an old graveyard to impress his zombie girlfriend.  Homages  There have also been films that pay homage to the genre: = Shaun of the Dead (2004) = Directed by Edgar Wright. The film is about an unmotivated slacker who must cope with a zombie uprising, in London, while trying to sort his life out. Simon Pegg notes in the interview on the DVD Release of Shaun of the Dead and in an interview on BBC Radio 1 prior to the film's release that they sought George A. Romero's blessing and acknowledgement or the film would not have been released. Simon Pegg comments that \\"George in fact loved it so much, we [Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright] were asked to be in the film Land of the Dead as leading characters, but we said no, no way, definitely got to be zombies!\\" Shaun of the Dead features numerous references to not only Romero films, but several other horror/science fiction movies too. = Fido (2006) = Directed by Andrew Currie. The film takes place after the zombie apocalypse, in a small, safe, idyllic 1950s-style town. In this film zombies are kept as slaves or pets, until something inevitably goes wrong. = Dance of the Dead (2008) = Directed by Gregg Bishop. The film is about a high school prom in Georgia which is unexpectedly interrupted when a graveyard, next to a power plant, becomes the sudden source of reanimated cadavers. As zombies march on the high school, a motley group of dateless teenage outcasts takes on the zombies and saves the day. = Zone of the Dead (2009) = Directed by Milan Konjeviƒá and Milan Todoroviƒá. Also known as Apocalypse of the Dead in the U.K. and U.S., Zone of the Dead is a Serbian zombie horror film starring Ken Foree from the original Dawn of the Dead and its remake. The movie is in English and it has been released by Epic Pictures Releasing in America on September 1, 2012 under the title Apocalypse of the Dead. It has a cult status in some regions and the sequel is in development.  Documentaries  = Document of the Dead (1985) = Directed by Roy Frumkes. Document of the Dead is a 1985 documentary film that takes a look back from Romero's first television commercials onward and it chronicles his career and stylistic techniques. = Fan of the Dead (2003) = Directed by Nicolas Garreau. Fan of the Dead is a 2003 52 minute documentary road-movie revealing the filming locations of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead remake with exclusive interviews with the cast of the George A. Romero's trilogy. Fan of the Dead was released on DVD/Blu-ray in USA/Canada (Cheezy Flicks), France (Bach Films), Italy (Millennium Storm), Germany (CMV Laservision), Spain/Portugal (Manga Films), Great-Britain (Arrow Films) and Australia (Umbrella Entertainment). Additional credits: Music by Sebastian Munoz and Antonio Martino; Edited by Olivier Andre. = One for the Fire: The Legacy of 'Night of the Living Dead' (2008) = Directed by Robert Lucas (as Robert L. Lucas) and Chris Roe. One for the Fire: The Legacy of 'Night of the Living Dead' is a 2008 documentary film made to celebrate the 40th anniversary of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. It features most of the main people behind the film, as well as a few of the lesser known people who had minor roles in the movie. Romero, John Russo, Russell Streiner, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman are among those interviewed. Additional credits: Produced by Robert Lucas and Chris Roe; Written by Billy Gram, Robert Lucas and Chris Roe ; Music by Jess Bryden; Cinematography by Robert Lucas; Edited by Michael Felsher. = Autopsy of the Dead (2009) = Directed by Jeff Carney. Autopsy of the Dead is a 2009 documentary film that examines the living history behind Night of the Living Dead that has since attained the status of a cultural phenomenon. Additional credits: Produced and written by Jeff Carney and James Cirronella; Editing and Cinematography by Jeff Carney. = Cinemall (2011) = Directed by Gavin Shaw and Craig Belliveau. Cinemall is a 2011 short documentary film about the Monroeville Mall, the main location of Dawn of the Dead. Additional credits: Produced and cinematography and editing by Gavin Shaw and Craig Belliveau; Written by Gavin Shaw; Music by Carlo Carosi. = Birth of the Living Dead (2012) = Directed by Rob Kuhns. Birth of the Living Dead focuses on the impact Night of the Living Dead had on pop culture.  Living Dead in other media  Although the majority of the Living Dead media has been films, related projects have been released in other media. A handful of books and comics books take place in the Living Dead universe. As with the films, some of them are officially endorsed, while others are not. = Books = *Night of the Living Dead (1974), by John A. Russo. A novelization of the first film. *Return of the Living Dead (1978), by John A. Russo. A stand-alone sequel to Night of the Living Dead, with few similarities to the eventual films of the same name. *Dawn of the Dead (1978), by George A. Romero and Susanna Sparrow. A novelization of the second film. *Book of the Dead (1989) and Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2 (1992), anthology books compiled by a number of authors, most notably Stephen King, with forewords written by Romero and Tom Savini. *Night of the Living Dead (2009), by Christopher Andrews. A new novelization of the first film, not authorized by Romero or Russo. = Comics = * Toe Tags, also known as The Death of Death is a six-issue comic book miniseries originally published from December 2004 to May 2005 by DC Comicswhich was based on an unused script by Romero. It was drawn by Tommy Castillo and Rodney Ramos, with covers by horror artist Berni Wrightson. Romero's story is actually based on an unused script for a sequel to his Dead films; the miniseries therefore follows his similar tropes: extreme gore, social commentary, evolving zombies, and the heroes riding off in the end into an unknown fate. Escape of the Living Dead series * Escape of the Living Dead is a five-issue comic book miniseries originally published from September 2005 to March 2006 by Avatar Press and written by John A. Russo as a sequel to Night of the Living Dead. * Escape of the Living Dead: Fearbook is a single issue comic book originally published August 2006 by Avatar Press and written by Mike Wolfer and is a sequel to Escape of the Living Dead. * Escape of the Living Dead: Airborne is a three- issue comic book miniseries originally published from September 2006 to November 2006 by Avatar Press and written by John A. Russo and Mike Wolfer and is a sequel to Escape of the Living Dead. * Escape of the Living Dead Annual #1 is a single issue comic book originally published March 2007 by Avatar Press and written by Mike Wolfer and is a sequel to Escape of the Living Dead. * Escape of the Living Dead: Resurrected is a collection of the whole series originally published January 2008 by Avatar Press. It contains all 10 issues of the story: the original five-issue miniseries, the three-issue Airborne miniseries, the Fearbook, and the Annual. Night of the Living Dead series * Night of the Living Dead * Night of the Living Dead 2011 Annual * Night of the Living Dead Annual #1 * Night of the Living Dead: Back From the Grave * Night of the Living Dead: The Beginning #1 * Night of the Living Dead Holiday Special #1 The Walking Dead * The Walking Dead (2003), an ongoing comic book account of a zombie-apocalyptic world written by Robert Kirkman. Robert Kirkman later stated that his series would have been called Night of the Living Dead, since it was in the public domain, as a way to get more recognition. The first page of the proposal had lines taken from Romero's film and the story was to have taken place in the '60s. Publisher Jim Valentino suggested Kirkman to change the title to something else, as it made no sense to create something under the title that could not be trademarked. Kirkman later said that Night would have been \\"the most inaccurate title The Walking Dead could have had\\". The hit television series The Walking Dead, based on the comic book series, premiered in 2010. Marvel Comics * Marvel Comics has published two miniseries under its mature imprint, Marvel MAX, featuring Simon Garth. IDW *IDW Publishing has published several zombie miniseries in its history, tying into one universe. = Video games = * Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green (2005), developed by Brainbox Games for PC and the Xbox. A first-person shooter licensed video game based on the George A. Romero zombie horror movie Land of the Dead. * Dead Rising (2006), developed by Capcom for the Xbox 360. Contains exact parallels to Dawn of the Dead, being set in a zombie-filled shopping mall. The similarities are so conspicuous that a legal disclaimer was put on the game's packaging after a dispute with the MKR Group, holder of the rights to Dawn of the Dead, which was dismissed in court. *In Capcom's Breath of Fire, a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment system, the town north of Winland, that Nina and the two winged soldiers must travel through, is infested with zombie-like creatures at night.

The Garde mobile (\\"Mobile Guard\\"; also called Garde nationale mobile though it had nothing to do with the Garde nationale) was intended to be the body which would in effect conscript all who had been able to avoid military service. The Garde would also take in all conscripts on completion of their army service. Napoleon III took up the idea and announced on 12 December 1866 that the Garde Mobile would eventually attain a strength of 400,000 troops. Its members were colloquially known as \\"Moblots\\". It origins lay in the crises that led up to the Franco-Prussian War, when Adolphe Niel, Minister of War for France under Emperor Napoleon III, attempted to bolster French military power creating a service which would provide reserves to be added to the regular French army. Although there was conscription into the army, not only was it not universal but middle-class people could purchase exemptions for their sons in a system known as Remplacement. Both the left and the right in the Corps Legislatif took issue with the proposal. The right wanted an all-professional army; the left were opposed to Bonapartist militarism, or wanted a \\"People in Arms\\" as their defense service. Hence not much money was spent for the equipment or training of the Garde Mobile. Its authority to conscript was also diminished. Servicemen were trained fourteen days per year, each one not followed by another, so they could return home to sleep. This service was not even permitted to deploy beyond the local areas of which the units were formed; thus, they were hardly mobile. The Garde Mobile had different uniforms from those of either the regular infantry, the National Guard, or the infantry of the French Marines. They did not get the excellent French Chassepot rifle. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, troops were called up into the Garde Mobile, and they received a mixture of inferior equipment bought from foreign countries, the transport of which was secured by the French Navy.

At , it is the state's longest north‚Äìsouth route and the third longest state route overall, after NY 5 and NY 17\\\\. Many of the state's major east‚Äìwest roads intersect with, and often join, NY 22 just before crossing into the neighboring New England states, where U.S. Route 7 (US 7), which originally partially followed NY 22's alignment, similarly parallels the New York state line. Almost all of NY 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets. The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated Bronx and lower Westchester County, and a section that runs through the city of Plattsburgh near the northern end. The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the New York City watershed in the northern suburbs of the city, to dairy farms further upstate in the Taconic and Berkshire mountains, to the undeveloped, heavily forested Adirondack Park along the shores of Lake Champlain. An section from Fort Ann to Keeseville is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage. The oldest portions of today's NY 22, in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline, were Native American trails. Dutch, and after them English, settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market, with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 20th century, as automobile use became widespread, the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway, first designated as NY 22 in 1930. In its early years the highway began in Manhattan; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border. Route description NY 22 starts as an urban arterial road, passing through the most populous communities along its route within its first . After running northerly from its origin in the Bronx it veers slightly to the northeast in the vicinity of a traffic circle near Kensico Dam before heading northward for good as a mostly two-lane rural route all the way to the state's North Country. The majority of NY 22's routing is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, several sections are maintained by other jurisdictions. The southernmost of these is in the Bronx, where the entirety of the highway within the borough is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). In Westchester County, NY 22 is mostly locally maintained within the city of Mount Vernon and is county- maintained within the city of White Plains. In Clinton County, the route is locally maintained within the city of Plattsburgh. During its course, NY 22 intersects or runs concurrently with 46 other designated routes: one state parkway, five Interstate Highways, and seven U.S. Highways not counting its own termini. Of the surface road intersections, 18 terminate at NY 22 and 15 are concurrencies shared with the crossing routes, accounting for , or 21.5% of the highway's total length. =The Bronx to Kensico Dam= alt=A sign with the number \\"22\\" in black on a white shield, itself on a black background, on a slightly skewed metal post stands at front right. Across a road are some low multistory urban buildings NY 22 starts as Provost Avenue at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in the Eastchester section of the Bronx, intersecting with East 233rd Street about to the north. It soon crosses the Westchester county line into Mount Vernon and becomes South Third Avenue, beginning a section in that county. Shortly after the county line, NY 22 makes a sharp turn to the east at the South Columbus Avenue intersection, soon passing St. Paul's Church National Historic Site on its north, then curving back to that direction. It parallels the nearby Hutchinson River Parkway as it passes through the suburbs of Bronxville and Tuckahoe. At Wilson Woods Lake, it crosses under a railroad bridge on the Metro-North New Haven Line and becomes North Columbus Avenue, then has its first interchange with a limited-access road at the Cross County Parkway. Country clubs on either side bracket NY 22's entry into Eastchester. It makes a turn to the northeast, passing the Vernon Hills Shopping Center to the right. After leaving Eastchester, NY 22 continues north into the village of Scarsdale. Paralleling the Bronx River Parkway (BRP), enters Westchester's county seat, White Plains. NY 22 also intersects NY 125 and NY 119 in downtown White Plains, then bends to the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the Cross-Westchester Expressway (Interstate 287 or I-287). The White Plains Rural Cemetery is visible to the west as NY 22 continues northward out of the city. In North White Plains, the surrounding area becomes less developed as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the traffic circle where the BRP ends and the Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam. =Kensico Reservoir to Brewster= While the Taconic State Parkway continues along the northwest heading NY 22 had been following, NY 22 itself veers to the northeast along the reservoir's south shore. After crossing a small bridge over one of the reservoir's bays, NY 22 becomes a four-lane divided highway and begins a thousand-foot (() concurrency, the first of 15 along its length, with NY 120. The combined roads pass just west of IBM's Armonk headquarters and the \\"Duke's Trees angle\\", the westernmost point in Connecticut. For the first time, NY 22 runs parallel to New York's eastern border, intersecting I-684 for the first of several times just north of the short portion of that highway in Connecticut, after which NY 22 reverts to two lanes. A short distance later, NY 433, one of the state's shortest highways, heads south from NY 22 into Greenwich. After that junction, NY 22 bends back to the north, paralleling I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural route through the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown Bedford, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with NY 172 for a mile (1.6 km), its first concurrency with an east-west route, then veers back to the northwest at the center of town. Just to the north, NY 121, the only north‚Äìsouth state highway whose route is entirely east of NY 22, forks off from its southern terminus. Another mile past that, NY 22 returns to a due-north heading, passing the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site a National Historic Landmark, where it turns west briefly, and Harvey School, where it curves to the northwest again. After the Katonah Museum of Art it widens briefly at a major intersection with NY 35. north of that junction, NY 22 becomes parallel with I-684 into the Town of Somers and the hamlet of Goldens Bridge. On the other side of the Interstate, accessible via NY 138, is the Goldens Bridge station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which begins a long parallel alignment with NY 22 at this point. alt=A pair of bridges pass from left to right on tall supports that tower over the other structures in the area, such as telephone poles and single-story buildings. The two-lane NY 22 passes underneath the bridge and proceeds into the background. The railroad's Purdy's station is a short distance west of the next junction, NY 116\\\\. At another traffic light to the north, NY 116 goes east to Titicus Reservoir at the northern intersection, the highway crosses under I-684, remaining between it and the railroad tracks. Just past the Interstate, NY 22 turns west onto Hardscrabble Road, which soon turns north again to follow the tracks to the next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, NY 22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US 202\\\\. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir. After paralleling the reservoir for almost , a third route, US 6, joins the concurrency just east of the village of Brewster, forming the only three-route overlap along NY 22\\\\. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying I-84, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US 6 and 202 continue east for Danbury while NY 22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The next thousand feet (300 m) of NY 22, along the brief extension of I-684, is the highway's only expressway section; the roadways merge and narrow to two lanes after they cross the Croton's East Branch. =Harlem Valley, Taconics and Berkshires= alt=A four-lane highway descends a hill and disappears from view. In the background are large, tree-covered mountains. NY 22 continues heading northeast along a narrow strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas of the town of Patterson, where two local state highways, NY 312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY 311, and passing another strip plaza, NY 22 crosses into Dutchess County. After another supermarket strip to the east, a long, gentle divided bend in the road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY 55 comes in from the west. It joins NY 22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY 22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, near the lower end of the Taconic Mountains. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's similarly named station. NY 22 and NY 55 continue their long curve into the town of Dover, past the Harlem Valley‚ÄìWingdale station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The NY 55 concurrency ends when that road forks off east towards Connecticut at the hamlet of Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into Amenia, where an overlap with NY 343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic. NY 343 remains joined with NY 22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards Sharon, Connecticut. At the same junction, US 44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with NY 22. The valley opens up as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes by the large Coleman Station Historic District. After intersecting with NY 199 at its eastern end, NY 22 and US 44 veer northeast into the small village of Millerton in the northern protrusion of Dutchess County's Oblong, an area once the subject of a boundary dispute between New York and Connecticut in the late 17th century. US 44 continues eastward towards Lakeville, Connecticut, only a mile (1.6 km) east at this point, while NY 22 resumes its northward course into the shadow of the ridge ahead, where Brace Mountain, Dutchess County's highest peak, dominates the view. At another gentle curve, NY 22 slips into Columbia County and the town of Ancram. North of the county line, Massachusetts becomes the state behind Alander Mountain and the other peaks visible to the east. The southernmost route from New York to the Massachusetts state line, NY 344, leaves for Bashbish Falls State Park just west of the hamlet of Copake Falls. NY 22 passing the alt=A two-lane paved road winding through countryside from just right of the camera, down the center of the frame, towards a hill covered with green trees under a blue sky with some small clouds in it. On the far side of the road there is a sign with the number 22 on it; below it is a white on blue sign with \\"Be Prepared to Stop\\" on it in capital letters. Telephone wires enter the image from top left, connecting to a wooden pole at the center The next major junction is at Hillsdale, where NY 23, the longest east‚Äìwest state highway not to overlap with NY 22, intersects at a traffic light just east of downtown. At Green River, NY 71, the state's shortest two-digit route, begins it short eastward course into Massachusetts. NY 22 then crosses into Austerlitz, where the surrounding terrain becomes much more wooded and the valleys become narrower. In the center of town, the historic hamlet of Old Austerlitz, East Hill Road offers a short detour to Steepletop, the farm where Edna St. Vincent Millay lived, another National Historic Landmark. A short distance later, NY 22 intersects with NY 203 at its eastern end. NY 22 then veers sharply to the northeast, resuming a northward direction within of the state line, the highway's closest approach to it along its entire length. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the New York State Thruway's Berkshire section (I-90) for a mile. NY 980D (an unsigned reference route) leaves to the east, where it becomes Massachusetts Route 102 at the state line. After Thruway exit B3, NY 22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects NY 295, then passes Queechy Lake. NY 22 then straightens out to reach New Lebanon, where it intersects US 20\\\\. Ending a stretch with no concurrencies, the longest on NY 22, New York's longest east‚Äìwest route (US 20) overlaps with its longest north‚Äìsouth route (NY 22) for a mile before the former continues to Pittsfield and the latter returns to the border- paralleling course, which takes it into Rensselaer County. historic district along NY 22 in downtown Hoosick Fallsalt=A view of an urban street at dusk with brick buildings on either side and a brown building with a large arched window in the distance at dusk, with the street lamps lit As NY 22 continues north, it remains, at first, within a mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY 43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through the town of Berlin. NY 22 trends further west, then back east to where NY 2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York‚ÄìMassachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY 22, NY 346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont. Shortly afterward, the highway descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major east‚Äìwest state road, NY 7\\\\. After turning northeast to join it at a traffic light, NY 22 overlaps with Route 7 for , then forks off to the north just before crossing the Hoosic River. NY 22 follows the river for to Hoosick Falls, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another , at North Hoosick, NY 67 comes in from the east and the two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County. =Washington County= The next of NY 22 traverse Washington County, the longest portion of the highway in a single county. Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the line, NY 67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NY 22 straightens out again to go due north. After , it reaches Cambridge, where NY 313 forks off to the east. In the middle of town, NY 372, a local connector to Greenwich, ends. North of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the Appalachians and the Adirondacks. Beyond NY 29's eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, NY 22 heads eastward again through of countryside until, just before reaching Granville, it comes within of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NY 22 intersects NY 149 and the two routes overlap for until Route 149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NY 22's two suffixed routes, NY 22A, begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes Vermont Route 22A (VT 22A), paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line. alt=In the foreground is a small cluster of trees that has built up alongside NY 22\\\\. Beyond those is a large cultivated field; even farther out is a dense forest. In the distance is an area of lowlands surrounded by forests and bisected by a narrow, winding waterway. Two large mountain ranges are barely visible in the far-off distance. Immediately after this junction, NY 22 begins a long curve away from the state line that has it running due west at the end of NY 40 in North Granville. It heads northwest a little further until, after passing between Great Meadows and Washington state prisons, it reaches US 4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. At this point the highway is from the state line, the farthest west it has gotten from it since southern Westchester County. The overlap with US 4, the first to pair NY 22 with another north‚Äìsouth route since the short concurrency with NY 120, lasts for along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US 4 leaves to assume the east‚Äìwest course it takes across northern New England. =Adirondack Park and Lake Champlain= As NY 22 bends westward after leaving Whitehall, it rounds the north end of the ridge to the west, offering views into Vermont. Once again the Vermont state line is very near NY 22, but now it is separated from New York by water instead of land. The stream at the bottom of this valley, surrounded by the low lying Drowned Lands flood plain, is the inflow for Lake Champlain. The lake's South Bay, which the road crosses immediately after this turn, is also the Blue Line. NY 22 has now entered the Adirondack Park, the Forest Preserve and National Historic Landmark, and the largest publicly protected area in the contiguous United States. Within the park, NY 22 mainly follows the lakeshore, closer to some of its more populated areas. alt=A two- lane paved road curves rightward away from the viewer toward a rise in the center of the image amid a snowy landscape of fields and woodlots under mostly cloudy skies, with a ridge of hills on the left It climbs through rock cuts as it meanders north on the narrowing isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the Essex County line. into the county, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, Ticonderoga. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY 74 comes in from the ferry to the east, the first intersecting state route since Whitehall, ending the longest such break on NY 22 at . The two routes overlap for almost until NY 74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with NY 9N, while NY 22 turns right to join NY 9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation for the longest of its concurrencies, at . At first, NY 22 and NY 9N veer west, away from the lake, but then return to its shoreline to avoid a nearby mountain, just before Crown Point. NY 185, a small connector road, runs from NY 9N and NY 22 along the peninsula to become VT 17\\\\. The road remains close to the widening lake for the next , with the tracks of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, used today by CSX for freight and Amtrak for passenger service between New York and Montreal, sometimes immediately to the east. After passing through Port Henry to Westport, where 9N leaves heading west for Elizabethtown. Beyond that junction, NY 22 again turns inland, going through the easy pass around Split Rock Mountain, going northwest to Wadhams where it turns northeast to Whallonsburg, then north. At Boquet, it makes an abrupt turn to go due east back to the lakeshore and ferry landing at Essex, where it connects to the Charlotte‚ÄìEssex Ferry via Dock Street, leading to VT F-5 on the opposite side of Lake Champlain. alt=A two-lane highway in a wooded area during autumn. It drops away in the center, with a view toward a distant landscape with a body of water and mountains beyond. On the right is a sign with the number 22 The highway again follows the lakeshore to Willsboro, where NY 22 heads to the northwest again, inland, through dense forest, until it heads west and intersects US 9 in the town of Chesterfield, the other major north‚Äìsouth surface route up the state's eastern side. NY 22 and US 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles in the southern part of the state, run through a narrow corridor for until US 9 and NY 22 veer east again toward Keeseville. Here, NY 9N ends and US 9 and NY 22 separate, ending the last concurrency along the latter. The two will exchange corridors, with US 9 following the lake shore line while NY 22 remains mostly inland. NY 22 enters Clinton County just north of Keeseville, and then leaves Adirondack Park beyond at the Peru town line. =Clinton County= Just south of the hamlet of Peru, the short NY 442 terminates at NY 22\\\\. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable River crossing, NY 22's other suffixed route, NY 22B, branches off further inland. NY 22 continues north of Peru, and returns to the Northway's side again in a mile. After another , it has its first exit on the Northway near the now- closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base. It continues northeastward, crossing the Saranac River into Plattsburgh, the first city and most populous community NY 22 has passed through since White Plains. Northern terminus of NY 22 at US 11 in Mooers NY 22 runs along South Catherine Street for a few blocks, then divides into one-way couplets for the first time since Westchester County, with northbound traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US 9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting NY 3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, NY 374 begins along the westbound route as NY 22 turns to the north once again. The highway follows the railroad tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY 456, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, Chazy, NY 22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY 191, in the hamlet of Sciota. NY 22 continues past Sciota in a fairly straight north- northwesterly course through more woods with small home and farm clearings. Those yield to mostly fields just before the Great Chazy River, after which NY 22 enters the hamlet of Mooers. NY 22 comes to an end upon intersecting US 11. History =In popular culture= The road is celebrated and described in Benjamin Swett's 2007 photographic travelogue, Route 22. =Old roads= The road from the modern-day Bronx (then part of Westchester County) through White Plains to Bedford and points north was originally an old Native American path. This path was later used and widened by the first European settlers. During colonial times, the road was known as \\"the road to Bedford and Vermont\\". Further north, near Lake Champlain, the route now used by NY 22 was used by the St. Francis Indians of Canada as they went south to find warmer fishing areas. The old road was also used heavily during the American Revolution to transport iron south from the mines in the Adirondacks. Once White Plains became the county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between the village and the city of New York (then encompassing only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White Plains Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day White Plains Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains. The stretch from Salem to the Vermont border in Granville was part of the old Northern Turnpike, which began in Lansingburgh and went along modern-day NY 40\\\\. The Northern Turnpike was chartered on April 1, 1799. =Public ownership= alt=A black and white illustration of an unpaved highway flanked on both sides by fence and trees proceeds through mostly open land. A caption at the bottom reads \\"Picture of State Road, Patterson, N.Y.\\" In 1868, the New York State Legislature formed a commission \\"to regulate, grade, widen, gravel, and improve the old White Plains Post Road\\", which was amended in 1870 to \\"macadamize the road\\" between Mount Vernon and White Plains. The post road south of Mount Vernon, which was part of New York City, was later widened between 1902 and 1908. State highways were first formally defined by the state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern NY 22 were defined as part of legislative routes 1 and 22. Legislative route 1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY 120). Legislative route 1 continued north along modern NY 22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY 203 and NY 980B), then followed US 9 to Albany. Legislative route 22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY 7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY 22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga). =NY 22 designation= alt=A sign with the number 22 on it, similar to the one at the top of the article and in other pictures but with an additional black border, the letters \\"NY\\" above the numbers, and a different typeface for the numbers themselves In 1924, New York signed several major state roads with route numbers. Most of Legislative Route 1 was designated as NY 22, but with a direct route between White Plains and Armonk. Also, instead of continuing to Valatie, NY 22 initially ended at the NY 23 intersection in Hillsdale. By 1929, the road to Valatie had been improved and NY 22 was extended to US 9, with a length of . The middle section of modern NY 22 was designated in 1924 as NY 24, running for from Stephentown to Comstock. The portion of modern NY 22 north of Whitehall remained unnumbered in 1924 but the next year NY 30, a route assigned in 1924 that linked Mechanicville to Whitehall, was extended north from Whitehall to the Canadian border north of Mooers. In the 1930 renumbering, the NY 24 and NY 30 designations were both reassigned elsewhere. NY 22 was then extended north along their former routes, incorporating newly improved roads between Austerlitz and Stephentown, creating the route that existed until 2008. The segment of old NY 22 between Austerlitz and Valatie was renumbered to NY 203. alt=A two-lane street passes through a city neighborhood composed of a line of three-story buildings and a large church. The street is lined with decorative lampposts and small trees. In 1934, at the insistence of the Automobile Club of New York, several numbered routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY 22 among them. It was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then following East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US 1). From there, it continued south along the Grand Concourse (then overlapped with NY 100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY 22/100 concurrency continued south along Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending at Houston Street (NY 1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY 22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January 1, 1970, the NY 22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US 1 at NY 22's current southern terminus. =U.S. Route 7= In the original plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US 7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY 22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut, to use old New England Route 4 through Massachusetts and Vermont all the way to the Canadian border. Apparently New York did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by the American Association of State Highway Officials had relocated the southern end of US 7 to Norwalk, Connecticut. =NY 9N concurrency= In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the stretch from Ticonderoga to Keeseville now concurrent with NY 9N was designated solely as NY 22\\\\. The north end of NY 47 was also located at an intersection with NY 22 in Ticonderoga. At Westport, NY 22 connected to NY 195, an east‚Äìwest highway leading to Elizabethtown. At the time, Route 9N only extended from there to Keeseville. NY 9N was extended southward to Lake George , supplanting Routes 47 and 195 and becoming concurrent with NY 22 between Ticonderoga and Westport. NY 8 originally extended eastward from Hague to a ferry across Lake Champlain at Putnam when it was assigned as part of the renumbering. In between the two locations, the route utilized modern NY 9N, Montcalm Street, NY 22, and Wrights Ferry and Wrights roads. It was realigned in the early 1930s to continue east from Ticonderoga on what is now NY 74 to another ferry across the lake. NY 8 was altered again to follow NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to Crown Point, where it turned off the highway onto Bridge Road (now NY 185). Route 8 remained intact along this routing until , when Route 8 was truncated southwestward to NY 9N at Hague. =Realignments= alt=A rural, narrow two-lane highway passes through an area composed of trees, fields, and small brush. There is a snow berm at the side, and a pentagonal orange-on-blue sign with the number 81 at right. Over the course of many years, several sections of NY 22 were straightened, realigned to new roads, or both. Some old alignments are still either county-maintained or state- maintained. Several of these are in Dutchess County. In Dover Plains, the southern leg of NY 22's junction with NY 343 is maintained by the state as NY 980G, a reference route. To the north in the town of Amenia, a loop off NY 22 between Wassaic and Amenia is designated as CR 81\\\\. Another former routing of NY 22 in the town of Dover exists as CR 6, a loop route between the hamlets of Wingdale and Dover Plains that runs along the west bank of the Ten Mile River. Within the 44/22 concurrency, part of CR 5 (and its short spur 5S), a mile- long (1.6 km) loop west of the highway south of Millerton, is also a former alignment of NY 22. Before the construction of I-684, NY 22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of Brewster on what is now CR 50, a dead-end road maintained by Putnam County. Modern NY 22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit 10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road on the opposite side of the Croton River via the NY 981B connector. South of Copake Falls, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY 980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of NY 344. =Mooers area= The segment of NY 22 north of US 11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until 1988, when ownership and maintenance of that part of the route was transferred to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was co-designated as CR 34 by Clinton County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY 22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with US 11 in Mooers. The official alignment of NY 22 was not changed, however, as the New York State Department of Transportation still considered the Canadian border to be NY 22's northern terminus until 2014. Major intersections Suffixed routes NY 22 has two suffixed routes, both in the North Country. * NY 22A () is a spur connecting NY 22 to the Vermont state line south of Fair Haven. Once in Vermont, the route becomes VT 22A. The route was assigned in the early 1940s. * NY 22B () is a bypass around the southern and western extents of Plattsburgh. NY 22B begins at NY 22 in Peru and continues north through Schuyler Falls to Morrisonville, where it terminates at NY 3 near Clinton County Airport. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

The Chennai campus organizes the cultural fest Vibrance and the technical fest technoVIT.  Controversies  = Gender discrimination = Gender discrimination has been a common issue raised in universities across India. VIT allegedly use their restrictive rules and regressive practices to market to conservative parents of Southern India, particularly in their home state of Tamil Nadu and neighboring Andhra Pradesh. These practices include much more restrictive rules on women hostelers, moral policing, shaming by an all-round security force and special committees to look into moral paternalism. The Hindu reported that often women would find themselves checked at hostel rooms and asked to stop talking on mobile phones and sleep or study. Over time, videos and articles have emerged online about the same. VIT officials, however, maintain that stricter female hostel rules are a necessary safety precaution given the rise in crimes against women. VIT officials have stated that, while they agree that men and women must be treated equally, they have at times been faced by irate parents who have insisted on stricter codes of conduct. VIT despite calling itself a progressive educational institution committed to excellence, still ensures strict gender segregation at official events and fests. In October 2013, two female students were suspended after they helped to organize an online opinion survey of female VIT students, focusing on issues of safety and inequality. Commenting on the issue, VIT vice president Sekar Viswanathan said: \\"The students started a campaign based on the misplaced notion that the university discriminates against women, which is not true. They were taken home by their parents\\". In 2019, Indian news outlet The Print carried a story which alleged that the government was delaying according the Institute of Eminence status to VIT due to an alleged anti-Modi government stance by its Chancellor and an official Intelligence Bureau report alleging gender discrimination of students. = Lack of freedom of speech = VIT allegedly makes students sign an affidavit which prohibits them from speaking out against university management. The university code of conduct prohibits any form of protest or action within premises or outside which may spoil repute of the institute and prohibits passing out information to any media group without prior permission of university officials. In 2015, Indian stand-up comedian Papa CJ was banned from the campus for taking up issues related to gender discrimination and moral policing during his show at GraVITas. He put up a video about his ban on his Facebook page and tweeted about the same describing his ban and a video recording of his show. = PUBG ban = In December 2018 a circular sent out by VIT Vellore's Chief Warden of Men's Hostel banning the online multiplayer game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

History Route in 1930 The town, located on present-day California State Route 62 between Twentynine Palms and the Colorado River, grew around a Santa Fe Railroad subdivisionDefined as \\"A portion of a division designated by timetable.\\" http://www.transportation- dictionary.org/Railroad-Dictionary/Subdivision Railroad Dictionary; accessed July 31, 2012 and siding. The subdivision and siding are still in use, but have since changed hands and currently belong to the Arizona and California Railroad, a short line serving southeastern California from Rice to Cadiz, California and southwestern Arizona at Parker. It was the starting point of the abandoned Ripley Branch that goes through Blythe to Ripley, California. Rice Army Airfield/Rice Airport To the east of Rice is the Rice Municipal Airport, which was acquired by the United States Army's 4th Air Support Command in 1942 as a sub-base of Thermal Army Airfield, and was operational by the end of the year. While the airfield's date of construction is unknown, it was not depicted on a 1932 Los Angeles Airways Chart, indicating construction sometime in the ten years between 1932 and 1942. Rice Army Airfield consisted of two intersecting paved 5,000 foot runways and numerous dispersal pads south of the runways. In 1944 the airfield was transferred from Thermal Army Airfield to March Field. Operations at Rice Field were ended by August 1944, and the field was declared surplus on October 31, 1944. Abandoned & Little- Known Airfields: California: Southeastern San Bernardino County The desert training area near Rice Army Airfield was at one time considered as the site for the world's first atomic-bomb test (\\"Trinity\\"), and in fact was the second-choice site. Instead, a site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, was chosen.\\"Auto trips were made to the regions north and south of Grants and Thoreau, the Tularosa basin, the Jornada del Muerto Valley, and the desert training area. Aerial surveys were made at low altitude by one or another of the group, K. Bainbridge, R. W. Henderson, Maj. W. A. Stevens, and Maj. P. deSilva, over the same areas. The choices finally narrowed to either the Jornada del Muerto region in the northwest corner of the Alamogordo Bombing Range or the desert training area north of Rice, CA.\\" Kenneth T. Bainbridge, \\"Trinity\\" (LA-6300-H), May 1976 (reprinting a 1947 report). Rice Shoe Tree Rice CA Shoe Tree Rice became noted for its Shoe Tree, originally an underwear tree, a lone tamarisk on a turnout just south of the highway, adjacent to the main entrance to Rice Army Airfield. This hallmark for a trailer-based business that catered to personnel at what is now the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, customers passing on Highway 62 (also known as Rice Road) to and from the Colorado River would toss a pair of underwear in the tree's branches. After a fire burned most of the tree and all the underwear, the custom changed and the tree's burned husk became a collection point for old shoes. The tree was featured on California's Gold, a PBS program hosted by Huell Howser. The tree burned flush to the ground in 2003 after which a 'shoe garden' replaced it; a fence on which people hang shoes. Also in the immediate area, travelers occasionally stop to spell their names and initials on the nearby Arizona and California Railroad right-of-way with the multi-colored volcanic rock used as track ballast. Hand-assembled graffiti lines the railroad for the entire distance that it parallels Highway 62. Present day Shot of the Shoe Fence ‚Äì July 28, 2011 At some point during the period 1944‚Äì48, Rice Army Airfield was renamed Rice Airport and began operations as a public civilian airport, housing a small flight school for missionaries. Between 1952 and 1955, Rice Airport was changed to a private field, and by 1960 it had been abandoned. As of 2007, no standing structures remain and little evidence exists of the airport's former existence. There are no standing buildings and no residents in Rice at present. A hand-painted sign on the western outskirts of the town once announced that the townsite was for sale, but that sign has since been removed. The only building which remains in any condition is a demolished service station. In 2010, there was filming for the 2011 movie Fast Five near Rice. It was featured during the train scene in the beginning of the movie.

Popular sports include football, basketball, cricket, rugby union, swimming, badminton, and cycling. Many public residential areas provide amenities like swimming pools, outdoor spaces (football, basketball courts, running tracks) and indoor sport centres, with facilities for badminton, squash, table tennis, gymnastics, indoor basketball and volleyball, among others. Since Singapore is an island, Singaporeans also enjoy many water activities including sailing, kayaking and waterskiing. There is also a number of avid recreational scuba divers, a prominent diving spot being the southern island of Pulau Hantu, famous for its coral reefs. Football is arguably the most popular spectator sport. Singapore has its own professional football league, known as the Singapore Premier League (formerly the S.League). Launched in 1996, it consists of 10 teams competing against one another. Each team has its own home stadium, which are mostly located in heartland towns. In 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2012, the Singapore national football team were champions in the AFF Championship, the premier football competition in Southeast Asia. Singapore's athletes have performed well in regional and international competitions, especially in table tennis, badminton, sepak takraw, bowling, sailing, silat, swimming and water polo. To date, Singapore has won a total of one gold, two silver and two bronze Olympic medals. Singapore has also amassed a total of 41 gold, 59 silver and 117 bronze medals at the Asian Games. Recreational Favourite Singaporean sports include outdoor sports, such as soccer, basketball, cricket, swimming, sailing, as well as various indoor sports like table tennis and badminton. Most Singaporeans live in public residential areas with amenities, such as public swimming pools, outdoor basketball courts and indoor sport complexes located in the vicinity. Since Singapore is surrounded by water, water sports, such as sailing, kayaking and water skiing are popular. Domestic competition Singapore has its own soccer (soccer) league, the S-League, formed in 1994, currently comprisin 12 clubs, including foreign teams. Other foreign clubs are interested in joining. The Singapore Slingers joined the Australian National Basketball League in 2006, which they left in 2008. They are one of the inaugural teams in the ASEAN Basketball League founded in October 2009. Beginning in 2008, Singapore started hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race was staged at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in the Marina Bay area and became the first night race on the F1 calendar and the first street circuit in Asia. =Government-sanctioned programs= The Government of Singapore sanctions a variety of sports-based programs for Singapore's education system in addition to normal physical education. The National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) was introduced in 1982, a scheme which requires the mandatory participation of all students within primary and secondary education. The scheme gives awards for a variety of physical tests for endurance, cardiovascular fitness and strength, including a medium-distance run of 1.6 or 2.4 kilometres for primary and secondary students respectively, and the results are reflected in each student's report book. As such, although gaining an award is not mandatory, students are often pressured to do so. In addition, the government sponsors the Singapore Sports School which opened on 2 April 2004, combining a secondary school curriculum with professional training in each student's preferred sport, in an attempt to nurture future generations of sportsmen and sportswomen. The concept behind the Sports School is that sporting talent should not be compromised when striving for academic excellence. Youth Olympic Games On 21 February 2008 the International Olympic Committee announced that Singapore won the bid to host the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. Singapore beat Moscow in the final by 53 votes to 44. On 15 September 2010, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports Teo Ser Luck announced that Singapore will start off the Singapore Biennale Games initiative to keep up the Singapore Youth Olympic Games 2010 Legacy, to be held every 2 years, starting from year 2011. Singapore has also performed well in subsequent editions of the Youth Olympic Games. To date, the country has won a total of 2 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze medals {cn}. Singapore sent its first 3 winter sport athletes to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics held in Lausanne, Switzerland . Rugby union Rugby was introduced to the British colony of Singapore in the late nineteenth century. It has had a steady presence since the beginning of the 20th century, when the Malay Cup between Singapore national rugby union team and Malaya was established, which is one of the oldest rugby competitions in the world.Bath, Richard (ed.)

However, whereas most Sigilverse titles were set in the far future, El Cazador took place on Earth during the Golden Age of Piracy of the 17th century. It contains none of the magical, science-fiction, or fantastical elements of the other Sigilverse titles. El Cazador began in 2003 and ran for six issues before CrossGen's bankruptcy brought the series to a halt. The company also published a prequel one-shot, El Cazador: The Bloody Ballad of Blackjack Tom, which revealed the history of the title's main villain. El Cazador was one of the few pirate-themed comic book series in the Modern Age of comic books, and perhaps the only recent ongoing series of the genre to feature a female lead. El Cazador was written by Chuck Dixon and pencilled by Steve Epting. Plot and characters In the opening issue, the ship carrying Spanish noblewoman Donessa Cinzia Elena Marie Esperanza Diego-Luis Hidalgo and others of her family are attacked by a pirate captain named Blackjack Tom. The Donessa is one of the few survivors of the attack. She swears to hunt down Tom and rescue his prisoners. To accomplish this, she renames her ship El Cazador (\\"The Hunter\\") and becomes a pirate herself, dubbed \\"Lady Sin\\" by her crew. The remaining issues of the series detail the beginnings of Lady Sin's quest as she forsakes her privileged past for life on the high seas.

They first meet when BB, driving his new Cadillac off the lot, backs into Tilley's own Cadillac. Though Tilley had the right of way, each man blames the other, and an escalating feud erupts between them. After BB smashes Tilley's headlights and Tilley shatters BB's car windows in response, BB sets out to seduce Tilley's long-suffering wife Nora in revenge. Immediately after having sex with Nora, he calls Tilley to taunt him with the news. Tilley tells BB to keep Nora; he wants to be rid of her. Meanwhile, both men have their own personal troubles. BB's older partner and mentor, Moe Adamson, is hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Tilley has a gambling problem and squanders what little money he makes betting on horse races, causing a rift with Nora. He's in debt to various creditors and the IRS, who begin confiscating his possessions for unpaid property taxes. Exhausted by their rivalry, the two men decide to play a game of pool to decide who should get Nora in order to end to their personal war. BB loses, but he does not honor the bet.

It separated the mainly Muslim factions in predominantly Muslim West Beirut from the predominantly Christian East Beirut controlled by the Lebanese Front. However, as the Civil War continued, it also came to separate Sunni from Shia. At the beginning of the Civil War, the division was not absolute as some Muslims lived East of the Green Line and some Christians lived in West Beirut; but, as the Civil War continued, each sector became more homogeneous as minorities left the sector they were in. The appellation refers to the coloration of the foliage that grew because the space was uninhabited. While most commonly referred to as the \\"Green Line\\", it was also sometimes called the \\"Demarcation Line\\". It generally stretched from the North of Beirut to the South, and the primary street that followed the Green Line was Damascus Street. There was no formal line or continual security but it was common to see militia checkpoints that people crossing at particular points had to go through and snipers on top of buildings were common. Many of the buildings along the Green Line were severely damaged or destroyed during the war. Since the end of hostilities, however, many of the buildings have been rebuilt within the framework of the urban renewal project of Solidere in Centre Ville. History =The Siege of West Beirut= The Green Line was a vulnerable point for both West and East Beirut. During Israel's siege of West Beirut, Israeli armed forces surrounded Western Beirut and stationed tanks along the Green Line. =Syrian withdrawal= After the Syrian military withdrew from East Beirut in August 1982, the Palestine Liberation Army was dispatched to the Green Line under the command of the Syrians. The residents on both sides of the line disapproved of the presence of the Palestine Liberation Army.

SYSO-in-the-Schools supports public school instrumental music programs by providing instruction in 25 Seattle-area public schools serving over 600 students annually. Marrowstone Summer Festivals provide learning for over 500 students age 7 to 25 years each summer. The Academic-Year Orchestra Program serves over 470 students through four full orchestras and one string orchestra. The Symphonette Orchestra serves as an arena for younger musicians to gain valuable performance experience. The next level orchestra is the Debut Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest orchestra in the organization's academic year program. The next orchestra is Junior Symphony Orchestra, which performs major works from the symphonic repertoire. The Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra, composed of young musicians in the Puget Sound region, is SYSO's flagship orchestra and one of the leading youth orchestras in the United States. The orchestra performs three regular season concerts in Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle Symphony, and regularly partners with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, the Seattle Opera, regional Broadway Musical Theater organizations, local choruses and internationally acclaimed guest artists and conductors. Finally, the Prelude String Orchestra, the lowest level, founded in 2016, is composed of very young musicians. SYSO also offers three summer music programs. The Marrowstone Music Festival, hosted by Western Washington University in Bellingham, serves around 185 high school and college aged students a year with a two-week intensive residential summer program. Faculty members at Marrowstone have included Dale Clevenger and Glenn Dicterow. Two sessions of Marrowstone in the City (MITC) are held in suburbs that surround Seattle, and serve over 330 younger players.www.marrowstone.org SYSO works with local schools through the Endangered Instruments Program, started by Walter Cole, a project that exposes middle school students to less commonly played instruments like the oboe, bassoon, viola, double bass and French horn. The first of its kind in the United States, the program has been emulated in many other places, including New York City, Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Vancouver, B.C. EIP partners with 13 Seattle-area public schools to serve over 170 students a year. Through all of its programs, Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras serves over 1,100 young musicians each year. Its concerts reach over 14,000, and are replayed over KING-FM to audiences in excess of 200,000. In November 2008, the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras received a grant of $500,000 from the Wallace foundation. Vilem Sokol at 90 History The Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra, the organization's oldest orchestra, was founded by the Music and Art Foundation in 1942, and its first conductor was Francis Aranyi.\\"Virginia Boren Hears About Youth's Symphony; Music and Art to Sponsor Group,\\" Seattle Times, 17 July 1942. He was an internationally famous violinist who performed with many of the greatest orchestras in Europe, and knew such leading composers as B√©la Bart√≥k and Arnold Schoenberg. In 1941 Aranyi came to Seattle as concertmaster of the Seattle Symphony, a position he retained for one season. Although his arrival was concurrent with the hiring of Sir Thomas Beecham as conductor, Aranyi was hired separately and was not chosen for the position by the conductor.Dorothy Brant, \\"Music Is Life to Aranyi of Seattle Symphony,\\" Seattle Times, 2 November 1941, Society Section, p. 3.Mary Louise Kantor, \\"Ronald Phillips--Living Legend,\\" The Clarinet, Vol. 30, 4(September 2003), p. 60. During Aranyi's direction of the Youth Symphony, he built up the group to an orchestra that was nationally recognized. Following establishment of the Little Symphony (now the Seattle Debut Symphony) in 1946, this training orchestra was advertised as \\"a reserve group for promotion to the major Youth Symphony,\\" and traced its roots to a Preparatory Ensemble which had been established in 1943.Youth Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific Northwest, Program, 17 October 1946.Youth Symphony Orchestra of Seattle, Program, 26 November 1943. The Little Symphony presented its first public concert on June 7, 1947.\\"Music,\\" Seattle Times, 1 June 1947, p. 5. Thomas Rodrique became its conductor in 1950. Francis Aranyi and Thomas Rodrique were the musical staff of the Youth Symphony Orchestra for the Pacific Northwest, as the organization was then called, until 1959. For its first two years, it was called the Youth Symphony Orchestra of Seattle. From 1944 to 1963, it was the Youth Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific Northwest. Vilem Sokol led the orchestra for 28 years (1960-1988), and it was under him that the YSO became the fourth orchestra in the United States to perform Gustav Mahler's Tenth Symphony. After the London Symphony Orchestra gave its premiere, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,Donald Peck, The Right Place, The Right Time!: Tales of Chicago Symphony Days (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007): 5. and the San Francisco SymphonySan Francisco Symphony Orchestra, Program, 5‚Äì7 April 1967; 7,9,10 May 1969. had been the only orchestras in the world to have performed the work. Under conductor Sokol, the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra made two recordings of Mahler's Tenth Symphony in its entirety. After Sokol's departure in 1988, the symphony was led by conductors Ruben Gurevich (1988‚Äì93) and Jonathan Shames (1994-2001). SYSO's Music Director was Dr. Stephen Rogers Radcliffe from 2006 to 2018. In 2019, Juan Felipe Molano became conductor.

Roy Henry (\\"King\\" Henry) () was an English composer, almost the certainly the pseudonym of an English King: probably Henry V, but also possibly Henry IV. His music, two compositions in all, appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall Manuscript. Identity Musicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two mass movements which appear, at the head of their respective sections, in the Old Hall Manuscript. Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, was in his early forties when the music was most likely written, since stylistic evidence places it around 1410. However, by 1410 Henry IV was suffering from a disfiguring disease and struggling to maintain his regal power. Therefore, it is unlikely that he, albeit a talented musician,Ian Mortimer, The Fears of Henry IV could be the composer of the two pieces. Whereas Henry V, despite being extremely 'busy on campaigns' after his succession, was recorded to never have ceased in his fondness for music. In 1420 the Pell Rolls recorded payments for two new harps to be shipped to the King in France. And the King even went so far as to take his chapel to the Agincourt campaign. This, as well as being substantial evidence for his piety, suggests that the latter is the composer. Henry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was known to have cultivated music in his youth. Payment for a harp along with 'swords and books on Latin verses' for the young lord Henry was recorded when he was merely six years old. An early biography of Henry V states: ‚Ä¶he was in his youth a diligent follower of idle practices, much given to instruments of music, and fired with the torches of Venus herself.Walsingham,Historia Anglicana Recent research has shown that work on the Old Hall Manuscript probably ceased on the death of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, in 1421. And the last piece of music in the Manuscript was doubtlessly written for the wedding of Henry and Catherine. Since Thomas was King Henry V's brother, and his chapel's musicians are now known to have included Leonel Power, and the manuscript itself passed to Henry V's chapel on the death of Thomas, and the composers included some members of the King's Royal Chapel, most notably John Dunstable. Obviously the manuscript could not have been passed to the long-dead Henry IV at this time, yet this is not a conclusive argument. But it is worth noting that Henry V's extraordinary piety - outdoing even his father in matters of religion - is consistent with the composition of sacred music, and we can be sure of his musical education. It is impossible to say for certain which man was the composer without further evidence. Music Roy Henry's music consists of two movements of the ordinary of the mass: a Gloria and a Sanctus, both for three voices, and written in a fairly low register. The music itself is skillfully written, and unusually for the time, no specific plainchant can be identified as a source; both pieces may be freely composed, or the underlying chant may be part of the enormous lost repertory of music from the early 15th century, hence unidentifiable (the vast majority of manuscripts of the time were destroyed in the 1530s during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries).

Trias (March 18, 1923 ‚Äì July 11, 1989) was an American karate pioneer, founding the first karate school in the mainland United States and becoming one of the first known American black belts.Bruce A. Haines. Karate's History and Traditions: Revised Edition (Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1995), pg.154 He also developed Shuri-ry≈´ karate, an eclectic style with roots in Chinese kung-fu, and indirectly some Okinawan karate. Life before karate  Trias was employed by Southern Pacific Company as a boilermaker apprentice from 1937‚Äì39 and a boilermaker from 1939-42. Introduction to karate While serving in the United States Naval Reserve as a Metalsmith First Class (M1c) during World War II, Robert Trias was stationed on or around Tulagi in the Solomon Islands from June 1944 to November 1945, and was a Navy champion middleweight boxer. There he met Tung Gee Hsiang, a Chinese missionary of Chan (Zen) Buddhism. Hsiang often watched Trias work out and imitated his boxing footwork, and he asked to practice with Trias. Trias refused because Hsiang was \\"just a tiny little guy,\\" but Hsiang was persistent and at last Trias agreed to spar with him. Hsiang gave Trias \\"the biggest thrashing of his life\\" and Trias then asked Hsiang to instruct him in the martial arts.Ortiz, Sergio. \\"Robert Trias: pioneer of U.S. karate.\\" Black Belt Magazine. April 1976, pages 36-39. Hsiang taught Trias some xingyiquan as well as some Okinawan Shuri-Te karate, which Hsiang had learned from Choki Motobu in Okinawa. Later, Trias studied with Hoy Yuan Ping whose lineage was from the Teshin Shinjo School of Kempo Jujutsu in Japan. Trias also held a 6th dan black belt in Kodokan Judo, and studied under Yaju Yamada. Trias was also mentored by Yasuhiro Konishi and Makoto Gima. Karate in the U.S.  In late 1945, shortly before Trias left the Navy in January of the following year, he began teaching martial arts in his backyard. He later opened the first public karate school operated by a Caucasian in the United States mainland in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1946. Trias served as an officer of the Arizona State Highway Patrol from 1946-1961 utilizing his self-defense knowledge on duty and teaching his fellow officers. In 1948 he founded the United States Karate Association (USKA), the first karate organization on the American mainland.Corcoran, John and Farkas, Emil. Martial Arts: Traditions, History, People. Gallery Books, New York (1983) p. 230Wallace, Bill. \\"Robert Trias and his USKA. Black Belt Magazine. March 1990, p. 12. Jointly with John Keehan, Trias hosted the first national karate tournament in the United States, called the 1st World Karate Tournament, at the University of Chicago Fieldhouse in 1963 in Chicago, IL. This event was retitled the USKA Nationals in 1966 and the USKA Grand Nationals in 1968. His rules for tournament competition are still used today with only slight variation. Trias' style was once dubbed, by Trias himself, as Shuri Karate Kenpo, Goju-Shorei-Ryu, and Shorei-Goju ryu though there is no relationship or direct ancestry to the Goju-Ryu currently practiced in Okinawa or the original form of Shorei-ryu once practiced by the Okinawans. His style is now referred to as Shuri-ryu to imply roots to traditional karate though his style is much different from any martial art originating from the Okinawan islands. It has much more Chinese influence and overtones than Okinawan. The naming of his style was as eclectic as the style itself. A few US organizations claim to trace their roots to him and the USKA, including the United States Karate-Do Kai, Professional Karate Commission, United States Karate Alliance, International Shuri-Ryu Association, and Kondo No Shokai. Career accomplishments Robert Trias was responsible for the following developments in karate in United States: *1955 - Wrote the first rules for karate competition. *1955 - Conducted the first karate tournament. *1958 - Wrote the first textbook. *1959 - Made the first instructional film. *1963 - Conducted the first world karate championships. *1968 - Conducted the first professional karate tournament.Robert Trias Biography usadojo.com Published works Trias authored Karate is my Life (1963), The Hand is my Sword (1974), The Pinnacle of Karate (1980), The Supreme Way (1983), and Render Yourself Empty (1984).

It was named after Silistra, since its governor often resided in this Danubian fortress. Around 1599, it was expanded and raised to the level of an eyalet likely as a benefit to its first governor-general (beylerbeyi), the khan of Crimea. It was centered on the regions of Dobruja, Budjak (Ottoman Bessarabia), and Yedisan and included the towns of Varna, Kustendja (Constan»õa), Akkerman (Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi), and Khadjibey (Odessa) with its capital at the fortresses of Silistra (now in Bulgaria) or √ñzi (now Ochakiv in Ukraine). In the 17th century, Silistra Eyalet was expanded to the south and west to include most of modern Bulgaria and European Turkey including the towns of Adrianople (Edirne), Filibe (Plovdiv), and Vidin. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, a series of Russo-Turkish Wars truncated the eyalet in the east with Russia eventually annexing all of Yedisan and Budjak to the Danube by 1812. Edirne Eyalet was constituted from south of Silistra Eyalet in 1830. With Ottoman administrative reforms of 1864 the Silistra Eyalet was reconstituted as the Danube Vilayet.

It was the last of a number of works composed toward the end of his life which were deeply autobiographical in nature. Previous elements in this group included The Confessions and Dialogues: Rousseau, Judge of Jean-Jacques. The book is divided into ten chapters called \\"Walks\\" (‚ÄúPromenades‚Äù in the original French). Walks One to Seven are complete, the Eighth and Ninth Walks were completed but not revised by Rousseau, while the Tenth Walk was incomplete at the author‚Äôs death. The first publication was in 1782. The content of the book is a mix of autobiographical anecdote, descriptions of the sights, especially plants, that Rousseau saw in his walks on the outskirts of Paris, and elaborations and extensions of arguments previously made by Rousseau in fields like education and political philosophy. The work is in large parts marked by serenity and resignation, but also bears witness to Rousseau‚Äôs awareness of the ill-effects of persecution towards the end of his life. Reception The reveries of the Solitary Walker (as it appears in Rousseau's original manuscript has been described as the most beautiful book composed by Rousseau, comprising a series of exquisitely crafted essays. It has been argued that each of the ten walks in Rousseau's book has a unique musical tonality combined with internal variations. \\"He struck a new romantic note by suggesting that the meditative spirit may always find in nature something responsive to its mood.\\" Before Rousseau's book the word \\"reverie\\" had a negative connotation: a 1771 dictionary defined the word as \\"ridiculous imagination\\" or \\"anxieties and cares that preoccupy the mind.\\" Through his book, Rousseau helped create a positive connotation for the word by reveling in experiences that circumvented conscious thought.

Haines, Karate's History and Traditions: Revised Edition (Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1995), pg.154. According to modern Shuri-Ryu stylists, Shu which means to learn from tradition, Ri means to transcend or go beyond, and Ryu means any style or particular school of thought (Please see Wikipedia article ShuHaRi). Although according to the Japanese and Okinawan language Shu (È¶ñ) means head, Ri (Èáå) means Village and Ryu (ÊµÅ) means Style. Later in 1948 he formed the first karate association in the U.S., the United States Karate Association (USKA). The USKA became one of the largest karate associations in the country; its membership included almost all of the early top karate instructors.Corcoran, John and Emil Farkas, Martial Arts: Traditions, History, People (Gallery Books, 1983), pg. 387. The style of Shuri-ry≈´ is taught in the United States, parts of Europe, and South America.  History  Shuri-ry≈´ is a style that has a lineage coming from a variety of sources, including karate. Other influences include Xing Yi Quan (Hsing-Yi) Kung Fu. Trias was first introduced to karate while in the Navy during World War II, when he was stationed in the Solomon Islands. In 1944 Robert Trias met Tung Gee Hsing and began training with him. Hsing practiced the Chinese system of Xingyiquan and had reportedly cross-trained with Motobu Ch≈çki in the Okinawan village of Kume Mura several years previously. Later Trias reportedly studied with Hoy Yuan Ping in Singapore in 1944. In addition to these teachers, Trias learned from other martial art teachers, such as Yajui Yamada (judo), Gogen Yamaguchi (G≈çj≈´-ry≈´), Roy Oshiro (G≈çj≈´-ry≈´), Yasuhiro Konishi, Makoto Gima (Shotokan, Shit≈ç-ry≈´), and several others. Both Konishi and Gima served as mentors to Trias instead of in a formal teacher-student relationship. Konishi, a prominent student of Gichin Funakoshi, Choki Motobu, and Kenwa Mabuni, recognized and countersigned Trias's promotion certificate to 9th Dan by the USKA in the 1960s.Isshinryu Karate: Donald Bohan's Memorial Website: John Bartusevics Gima was a prominent student of Funakoshi and he recognized Trias as 10th Dan in 1983, reaffirming Trias as style head for Shuri-ry≈´.  Techniques  In addition to the punches, blocks, and kicks of karate, Shuri-ry≈´ also incorporates joint locks, take-downs and throws, and kobud≈ç (traditional weapons). Several senior sensei also hold high ranks in jujitsu and judo. Shuri Ryu follows a system of teachings called the Haryu which are identifiers of the system. Shuri-ry≈´ also has several short combinations. These include: 26 ippon (ippon kumite kata), which are performed to develop form and power; 10 taezu (taezu naru waza) which are performed to develop speed and fluidity; 30 kihon which are performed to develop fighting technique; eight sen-te motions; and seven kogeki-ho ho to develop attacking and retreating. In addition, there are training exercises including form sparring (kata kumite), focus stance sparring (kime dachi kumite), free exercise (jiy≈´ und≈ç), and free sparring (jiy≈´ kumite).  Forms  Shuri-ry≈´ has three form exercises called Taikyoku Shodan, Nidan, and Sandan to prepare the student to learn the 15 core forms (kata): * Wansu * Anaku * Naihanchi Sh≈ç (Tekki Shodan) * Empi Sh≈ç (Wanshu) * Sanchin * Tsue Sho No Kon * Bassai Dai * Go Pei Sh≈ç * Dan Enn Sh≈ç * Naihanchi Ni (Tekki Nidan) * Nan Dan sh≈ç (Nij≈´shiho / Niseishi) * Kank≈´ Sh≈ç (Kusanku Sh≈ç) * Tekatana No Sai * Naihanchi San (Tekki Sandan) * Ten Sh≈ç Besides these forms, there exist numerous variations of Sanchin and Tensh≈ç. Also, the senior sensei of Shuri-ry≈´ also teach several other forms such as Shudo So and Hakutsuru Shodan, Nidan, Sandan, and Yondan. Many of the above kata emphasize the use of various animal forms, and the definitions are often reflective of this. For example, Wunsu (Strong Arm Dumping Form or Dragon Boy Dumping Form) uses the tiger form, Anaku refers to a swallow pivoting on a beach, Empisho (First Elbow Form) refers to the flying swallow, and Go Pei Sho refers to a tearing peacock. Some kata will emphasize multiple animal forms, such as Dan Enn Sho, where ten animals are emulated. Also, there are 15 animal body and 20 fist form exercises. This is atypical of what is taught and practiced on the Island of Okinawa.  Ranks  The Shuri- ry≈´ style, like most systems of the martial arts, uses a belt system to designate rank. The appropriate rank is awarded when the student demonstrates a certain level of proficiency when performing the required techniques, kata, etc. The ranking system as spelled out in \\"The Pinnacle of Karate\\" by Trias is as follows: * White (jukyu) * Orange (kukyu) * Gold (hachikyu) * Yellow (shichikyu) * Blue (rokukyu) * Green (gokyu) * Purple (yonkyu) * Brown (sankyu, nikyu, ichikyu) * Black (shodan through judan) At each rank, the student must also pass a rigorous physical requirement before performing the technical requirements. Running one or two miles (up to green = 1 mile, purple and beyond = 2 miles), lifting 10 or 15 lb weights 75 times over the head (depending on gender), performing 500‚Äì1000 front kicks, and various hand technique exercises are commonly used.  Identifying features  One characteristic feature of Shuri-ry≈´ is the use of the Shuri fist, in lieu of a standard fist. Instead of curling the index finger when making the fist, the upper half of the index finger is laid flat against the palm, with the thumb curled around the index finger and pushing down between the first and second joints, resulting in a tighter fist and better alignment of the ulna and radius bones with the first two knuckles of the fist. Another feature of Shuri-ry≈´ is the position of the thumb of the knife hand strike or block. The thumb and forefinger form a \\"j\\" so that the hand may be used in a variety of techniques (ridgehand, spearhand, open-hand throat strikes, etc.) without changing the thumb position. A feature seen in katas: when the next move is to be done, the head snaps in the direction of the attacker before anything else. The Dojo Kun used by the style of Shuri-ry≈´ remains in its intact form, as originally penned by Trias: * I shall conduct myself in a manner which will reflect credit upon myself and society. * I shall be loyal to my school and to the art it teaches. * I shall be honest and exercise integrity with the purpose of developing cooperation and trust with my fellow karate-ka and my teachers. * I shall exercise restraint in the use of my karate knowledge, employing it only in fair competition or in defense of my life, my family, and my country.  Chief instructors and senior sensei  Prior to 1989, Trias had designated 8 Chief Instructors and 3 assistant Chief Instructors of the Shuri- ry≈´ system to perpetuate Shuri-ry≈´ after his death; Roberta Trias-Kelley, John Pachivas, Robert Bowles, the late Ridgely Abele,The Columbia School of Karatedo celebrates 29th anniversary Pete Rabino, Michael Awad, Dale Benson, and Dirk Mosig, Other individuals who were designated Chief Instructors at one time but left Trias are Victor Moore, Phillip Koeppel (his most senior student), James McLain, John Hutchcroft, and Randy Holman. Traditionally, a karate system was owned by the family of the founder. Thus, upon Trias' death in 1989, his daughter, Roberta Trias-Kelley, inherited the Shuri-ry≈´ system as style head. Dirk Mosig followed her leadership. Eventually three factions developed from the Shuri-ry≈´ style. In 1995 John Pachivas appointed Robert Bowles as style head of Shuri-ry≈´. Bowles founded the International Shuri-ry≈´ Association (ISA) with the following Chief Instructors as Executive Directors: John Pachivas, Ridgely Abele, Pete Rabino, Michael Awad, and Dale Benson. Since then, the International Shuri-ry≈´ Association under Robert Bowles has become the largest organization of Shuri-ry≈´ stylists and has appointed more Chief Instructors and more Assistant Chief Instructors for the ISA. Additionally prior to his death in 2000, John Pachivas passed on his American Shuri Karate lineage to Jerry Piddington. A number of Shuri-ryu stylists can also be found in the United States Karate-Do Kai (USKK), an organization founded by former Chief Instructor and Trias' senior most student, Phillip Koeppel. Unlike the ISA, the USKK has not appointed new Chief Instructors. Instead, Koeppel appointed a Style Head which serves a similar function. The current USKK Style Head for Shuri-ryu is David Hamann, other senior instructors in this group include James McLain and Michael Awad. Former Chief Instructors Phillip Koeppel and John Hutchcroft are also USKK members, though they now practice Matsumura Seito Shorin-Ryu. Another USKK member and Trias student, Glenn R. Keeney also teaches Shuri-Ryu. Currently, there appears to be four strains of Shuri-ry≈´ each, respectively, centering on Roberta Trias- Kelley, Robert Bowles' ISA, Victor Moore's TWKA, and the USKK group under McLain/Awad/Hamann. Membership in the various organizations is not mutually exclusive, and many Shuri-ryu practitioners are active in multiple groups.

A graduate of Denver's Manual High School and Amherst College and a Marshall Scholar, he is also a professor and the director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University. He teaches graduate courses in the Literary Reportage concentration and undergraduate courses on the \\"journalism of empathy\\" and undercover reporting.  Writing career  Conover's books of narrative nonfiction have typically been researches of little-known social groups. He will often become an active participant with the subculture he is writing about. His first experiment with this melding of anthropological and journalistic method occurred during 1980, when he rode freight railroads back and forth across the western United States with some of the last remaining hobos. This experience, initially rendered as an ethnography for an honors thesis, became the basis of his first-person book, Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes (1984). Some of those people Conover met on the rails were Mexican nationals, and in his next book, Coyotes: A Journey Across Borders with America's Illegal Migrants (1987), he turned his attention to undocumented immigrants, describing them as \\"the true modern-day incarnation of the classic American hobo.\\" Conover spent a year traveling with Mexicans in order to write Coyotes; he lived in a \\"feeder\\" valley in the Mexican state of Quer√©taro, spent time in Arizona, Idaho, California, and Florida, and crossed the border three times. The 1987 book was published in a new edition during 2006 with a new preface and subtitle: \\"A Journey Across Borders With America's Mexican Migrants.\\" His next project, which he has stated he began in part to see whether the participatory method could work with wealthier people, describes life in the mining-town-turned-lifestyle-capital of Aspen, Colorado, where Conover worked as a driver for the Mellow Yellow Taxi Company, the Aspen Times, and for a catering company. The result was the book Whiteout: Lost in Aspen (1991). A few years later, Conover trained as a corrections officer and worked at Sing Sing prison in New York state for nearly a year as a rookie correction officer. The resulting book, Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing (2000), was a finalist for the Pulitzer PrizePulitzer Prize Non-Fiction and won the 2000 National Book Critics Circle Award in General Nonfiction,National Book Critics Circle Award: Past Awards among other honors. For many months, prisoners were banned from reading Newjack; now, inmates who receive a copy have to wait as much as several months while the state redacts several pages that it considers a threat to security. Conover discussed his next work, The Routes of Man: Travels in the Paved World (2010)Conover interview, Paper Cuts blog New York Times Book Review in the Paper Cuts weblog of the New York Times Book Review. His most recent book, Immersion: A Writer's Guide To Going Deep, explores the practical and ethical challenges of immersive reporting, citing examples from his own work and that of other writers such as Sebastian Junger, Anne Fadiman, Susan Orlean and Jon Krakauer. He discussed the book with journalist Kevin Deutsch in a Q&A; for the Columbia Journalism Review]. In addition to books, much of Conover's work has been published in magazines. He contributes frequently to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Vanity Fair, T Magazine, National Geographic Magazine, Travel + Leisure, Smithsonian Magazine and others.For a list, see Ted Conover articles He is on the editorial board of the literary magazine The Common, based at Amherst College, and published work in the debut issue.The Common official website.

They began playing together in a series of bands while in their teens and then all attended Oberlin College in Ohio, where they continued to play together. The three friends then moved to Brooklyn, New York after college, where the French Kicks were formed with vocalist/guitarist Josh Wise, a Princeton grad who originally hailed from Huntsville, Alabama. Having performed their first shows at Luna Lounge on Manhattan's Lower East Side, in 1999 they released a self-titled EP The French Kicks under the label My Pal God. Soon, after a lot of touring, the band signed to Startime International. They soon released the Young Lawyer EP in 2001. The group then embarked on a tour with fellow garage rockers The Vue and The Walkmen. In 2002 they released their first full-length album, One Time Bells. Jamie Krents departed the band the next year, and was replaced on bass by Lawrence Stumpf, Nick's younger brother. The following year they headlined Sepomana, WRMC 91.1 FM's annual music festival. In 2004, their next album, The Trial of the Century was released. Another personnel change occurred when Nick stopped playing drums at live shows to concentrate on his lead singing. A series of temporary drummers filled his spot until the band settled on Aaron Thurston, a Massachusetts native. In late 2005, Stinchcomb announced that he was leaving the band. In early 2010, rumors circulate that the band may have broken up or has held off work indefinitely. Their video for their single \\"So Far We Are\\" also features actress Olivia Wilde. In 2011, they appeared on the soundtrack for the movie The Art of Getting By.

The operation was launched on 25 May 1944, and was aimed at capturing or killing the Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito and destroying the headquarters, support facilities and co-located Allied military missions. It is associated with the Seventh Enemy Offensive () in Yugoslav history, forming part of the Seven Enemy Offensives historiographical framework. The airborne assault itself is also known as the Raid on Drvar (). Operation R√∂sselsprung was a coup de main operation, involving direct action by a combined parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia along with collaborationist Chetniks. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault. Fierce Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar contributed to the failure of the mission. Other factors included the German intelligence agencies refusing to share the limited information available on Tito's exact location, and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force. Background On 6 April 1941 the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia from multiple directions, rapidly overwhelming the under-prepared Royal Yugoslav Army which capitulated 11 days later. In the aftermath of the invasion Yugoslavia was partitioned between the Axis powers through a combination of annexations and occupation zones. An Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) was established on the territory of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, controlled by the fascist and ultra-nationalist Usta≈°e. The NDH was divided by a German‚ÄìItalian demarcation line, known as the \\"Vienna Line\\"; the Germans occupied the north and northeastern parts of the NDH, and the Italians the south and southwestern sections. The NDH immediately implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population of the puppet state. Following the collapse of Yugoslavia, armed groups appeared, and in the territory of the NDH, while the predominantly Serb resistance to Usta≈°e rule was initially not strongly aligned with ideology, two principal groups soon established themselves, the communist-led Partisans and the Serb nationalist Chetniks. The Partisans were resolutely anti-Axis throughout the war, but the Chetniks extensively collaborated with Italian occupation forces garrisoned in the NDH from mid-1941, and especially after the Italian capitulation in September 1943, also with the Germans. The Axis Case White and Case Black offensives of the first six months of 1943 caused significant setbacks for the Partisans; however, in September the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito took advantage of the capitulation of Italy and managed to increase the territory under his control and double his forces to around 200,000 men, arming them with captured Italian weapons. In late November, he held a National Congress at Jajce in a liberated area of the NDH, during which he was designated marshal of Yugoslavia and prime minister. He established his headquarters nearby at Drvar in the Dinaric Alps and temporarily suspended his successful tactic of being constantly on the move. Maximilian von Weichs, the Wehrmacht Commander-in- chief Southeast Europe, admitted a few weeks later that \\"Tito is our most dangerous enemy.\\" Tito's personal headquarters was initially located in a cave below a ridgeline about north of the centre of Drvar. Below the cave ran the Unac River, creating an obstacle to movement between the town and the cave, and a rail line ran along the ridgeline above the cave. As well as Partisan headquarters, several Partisan and Communist Party support, training and youth organisations were based in and around Drvar at the time, along with the Tito Escort Battalion which was responsible for Tito's personal safety. The British and Soviet military missions to the Partisans were also stationed in villages close to Drvar, as were some United States military officers. The British mission was headed by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, who was in London at the time of the raid, and included Major Randolph Churchill, son of Winston Churchill. At the time of Operation R√∂sselsprung (), the British mission was led by its second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Street. =Partisan dispositions around Drvar= alt=Map showing the deployment of Partisan forces around Drvar Apart from Partisan headquarters and related organisations in and around Drvar, there were between 12,000 and 16,000 Partisans in the area of operations that would be subject to the ground assault by XV Mountain Corps. Near Drvar were elements of the 1st Proletarian Corps commanded by Koƒça Popoviƒá; this corps consisted of the elite 1st Proletarian and 6th Lika Proletarian Divisions, the Corps headquarters being located in the village of Mokronoge, east of Drvar. Its subordinate formations were further away, the 6th Lika Proletarian Division west of Drvar, and the 1st Proletarian Division deployed in the area around Jajce and Mrkonjiƒá Grad, some east of Drvar. The nearest large Partisan formation to Drvar was the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division based in the Resanovci and Trubar villages some south and southwest of Drvar. In the wider area of operations were the Partisan 5th Corps commanded by Slavko Rodiƒá and the 8th Corps commanded by Vlado ƒÜetkoviƒá. The 5th Corps was deployed to the northeast and northwest of Drvar with its headquarters south of the Mrkonjiƒá Grad‚ÄìKljuƒç road, and the 8th Corps was positioned to the southeast with its headquarters in the mountains between the Glamoƒç and Livno valleys. Importantly for the coming battle, the 4th Krajina Division of the 5th Corps was deployed between Bihaƒá and Bosanski Petrovac. Two brigades of the 4th Krajina Division and one brigade from the 39th Krajina Division formed a defensive arc north of Drvar, running from Bihaƒá through Krupa to Sanski Most. The 9th Dalmatian Division of the 8th Corps was deployed to the south between Livno and Bosansko Grahovo. =German intelligence= alt=a black and white photograph of a uniformed German officer wearing the Knight's Cross and a helmet Three German intelligence organisations attempted to determine the location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members of which had been involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and the Usta≈°e Militia, and had been tracking Tito since October 1943. Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito before the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He got very close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation. The second intelligence organisation was FAT (Front Reconnaissance Troop) 216 of Section I of the . FAT216, commanded by Zavadil, was also attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, but did not contribute much to the intelligence used to plan the raid. On Adolf Hitler's orders, Otto Skorzeny of the (SD, the intelligence branch of the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted on behalf of the SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar with a small group of soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the tactical planning and execution of the operation. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and therefore planned the attack for that day. =Partisan intelligence= alt=black and white newsreel of Partisan headquarters and troops in Drvar The Partisans had their own highly effective intelligence network. They had been aware of the presence of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Yugoslavia for some time, and of the general threat of an airborne assault for over six months. They may have become aware of the isolation of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion or the concentration of transport aircraft and gliders at Zagreb and Banja Luka over a month before the operation. The Partisans also managed to recapture the deserter Skorzeny had interrogated. As a result of these early indicators of an attack, Tito's main headquarters was relocated to another cave near the village of Bastasi, west of Drvar. Tito then used the Drvar cave during the day, but returned to the Bastasi cave at night. As a further precaution, elements of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division were moved closer to Drvar. On 23 May 1944, a single German Fieseler Fi 156 reconnaissance aircraft flew several parallel runs up and down the Una valley over Drvar at around ; activity consistent with conducting aerial photography. The aircraft paid particular attention to the villages of Prinavor and Trniniƒá Brijeg where the British military mission and American military personnel were located. This was observed by Street, the acting commander of the British military mission, who assumed it was spotting for a bombing raid and advised both Tito and the Americans. Both Allied missions moved their locations as a result. Despite the intelligence received and observations made by the British, the Partisans appear to have been quite complacent about the threat; Tito's chief of staff, Arso Jovanoviƒá, swore that \\"a German attack was impossible\\". The most obvious indicator that Tito was unaware of the imminent attack is that he remained at the Drvar cave overnight on the evening of 24 May, following a celebration, instead of returning to Bastasi. Through Ultra intercepts of German signal traffic, the British had become aware that the Germans were planning an operation codenamed \\"R√∂sselsprung\\" but the information available did not include where the operation would occur or what its objectives might be. Planning Following intelligence collection, higher level planning for the operation began on 6 May 1944, after von Weichs had issued his initial orders. Hitler gave his approval to von Weichs' final plans on 21 May. The order to XV Mountain Corps was issued by Lothar Rendulic, the commander of 2nd Panzer Army, on the same day, leaving only three days for preparation. Ernst von Leyser, commander of XV Mountain Corps headquartered at Knin, was responsible for the conduct of the operation. The ground forces of von Leyser's XV Mountain Corps were significantly reinforced from Army Group F, the 2nd Panzer Army and V SS Mountain Corps reserves. These reinforcements included two panzer companies, the reconnaissance battalions of the 1st Mountain Division (the 54th Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion) and the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division, and most of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. The total number of German troops allocated to the operation was about 16,000 men. In outline, the XV Mountain Corps plan was for a heavy aerial bombardment of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body. =500th SS Parachute Battalion= Rybka received an outline of the operation on 20 May, and more details the following day. He realised that the gliders and transport aircraft would be insufficient for the whole of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion to be delivered to Drvar in one lift, so he came up with a plan involving two waves. The first wave of 654 troops would conduct the assault at 07:00 and a second wave of 220 troops would follow about five hours later. Critically, the intelligence he was given regarding the suspected location of Tito's headquarters (codenamed \\"Citadel\\") was that it was in or near a cemetery on high ground southwest of the centre of Drvar, nearly from Tito's actual headquarters cave. This would have far- reaching effects on the planning and execution of the assault. Rybka's plan for the first wave called for the insertion of 314 parachute troops in three groups (Red, Green and Blue) to secure the town, and another 354 troops in six glider-borne assault groups to carry out specific tasks. The glider-borne group tasks were: Luftwaffe alt=a black and white photograph of a wide-bodied military glider * Group (110 soldiers) ‚Äì capture \\"Citadel\\" and destroy Tito's headquarters ‚Äì to land at the cemetery * (Attacker) Group (40 soldiers) ‚Äì destroy the British military mission in the village of Prnjavor 2 km south of Drvar on the road to Bosansko Grahovo * (Stormer) Group (50 soldiers) ‚Äì destroy the Soviet military mission between the centre of Drvar and the Unac river * (Breaker) Group (50 soldiers) ‚Äì destroy the American military mission in the village of Trniniƒá Brijeg 2 km south of the centre of Drvar * (Daredevil) Group (70 soldiers including members of the Brandenburg Division, the officer Lieutenant Zavadil and some collaborationist Chetniks) ‚Äì capture the crossroads (codenamed \\"Western Cross\\") immediately to the west of Drvar including a nearby suspected communications facility * (Biter) Group (20 soldiers) ‚Äì seize an outpost radio station to the south of Prnjavor then assist the Group The second wave of 220 troops based on the training company of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were to insert by parachute at midday. Rybka does not appear to have planned for any significant contingencies such as errors in the intelligence on the location of Tito's headquarters. His only known contingency plan was that he would fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks. On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were transported to airfields at Nagy- Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for security reasons. The troops were not briefed on the operation until a few hours before it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man Luftwaffe DFS230 gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete. =Ground forces= The plan for the ground forces of von Leyser's XV Mountain Corps was for nine separate but coordinated thrusts toward the Drvar‚ÄìBosanski Petrovac area from all directions. The groupings and tasks were: * The 384th Infantry Regiment of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Croatian legionnaires), with elements of the 2nd Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion, referred to as after its commander, Willam, was to advance east at 05:00 from the village of Srb toward Drvar. had the primary responsibility for relieving then taking command of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Drvar on 25 May, and was then to attack in the direction of Bosanski Petrovac. * A battalion group of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division was to set out at 05:00 from Lapac and drive east through Kulen Vakuf to capture the crossroads at Vrtoƒçe. If necessary, they were then to advance northwest toward Bihaƒá to open the road. * The 92nd Motorised Regiment, with the 54th Reconnaissance Battalion (from the 1st Mountain Division), the 55th Pioneer Battalion (from the 1st Cossack Division), the 468th Armoured Car Company, and a regimental group of the 2nd Croatian Light Infantry Brigade was to advance southeast from Bihaƒá and Bosanska Krupa at 05:00 through Vrtoƒçe to capture Bosanski Petrovac as quickly as possible, destroy the Partisans in that location, and occupy the Partisan airfield and supply installations. After capturing Bosanski Petrovac, elements were to be sent toward Drvar to prevent the withdrawal of Partisans along that road and to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Drvar. * A regimental group of the 7th SS Division was to advance west from the area of Mrkonjiƒá Grad, break through Partisan resistance east of the Sana and then advance on a wide front to block escape routes east out of Drvar. Part of this group was to advance from Jajce along the rail line and roads through Savici to reach their objective, the area around Mliniste power station. * An ad-hoc consisting of officer cadets, with 1st Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion, under the command of the 7th SS Division, was to advance from Banja Luka toward Kljuƒç to seize the crossing point across the Sana utilised by the Partisans. * The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion with an additional panzer company was to advance from Livno and occupy any Partisan supply installations in the Livno Valley, and prevent any Partisan withdrawal to the south of Drvar by attacking through Bosanski Grahovo toward Drvar. * The 369th Reconnaissance Battalion of the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Croatian legionnaires), under the command of the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion, were to advance from Livno up the Glamoƒç Valley against Partisan forces withdrawing from Drvar to the southeast. * The 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, along with the collaborationist Chetnik Dinara Division of Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá, were to advance from Knin toward Bosanski Grahovo and conduct special operations against Partisans in the Prekaja-Drvar area. Operation alt=a panoramic photograph of a wide green valley with a small town in the middle distance The offensive began at 05:00 on 25 May 1944 with the advance of ground forces from their assembly areas surrounding their assigned operational areas. About 06:35, five squadrons of Luftwaffe bombers, including Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, began bombing targets within Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac. A total of 440 sorties were flown on that day. =Airborne assault and initial response= The 500th SS Parachute Battalion began to parachute and glide onto their objectives at 07:00, most parachutists and glider pilots being able to land relatively close to their targets despite the smoke and dust from the bombing. Some gliders landed significantly off course, including one that landed in front of the Bastasi cave 7 km to the west of Drvar, and several that landed in a locality named Vrtoƒçe near Drvar (not to be confused with Vrtoƒçe between Bihaƒá and Petrovac, which was on the axis of advance of the 92nd Motorised Regiment). The occupants of the glider that landed in Bastasi were immediately killed by members of the Tito Escort Battalion guarding the cave, and the occupants of the gliders at Vrtoƒçe had to fight their way toward Drvar. After landing, the first wave of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion quickly gained control of Drvar. Group supported by Red Group overcame minimal resistance at the cemetery and Rybka established his headquarters behind the cemetery walls, but there was no sign of Tito or his headquarters. Group and Group were also unsuccessful as the British and American groups had moved following the aerial reconnaissance on 23 May. Parts of Group landed their gliders in a field immediately south of the Drvar cave and came under fire from members of the Tito Escort Battalion on the high ground in the area of the cave. The Group landed their gliders at the \\"Western Cross\\", then assaulted a building they believed was the Partisan communications centre. The building was actually the office of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Central Committee, who resisted fanatically until the building was levelled using satchel charges. Both Blue Group and Green Group, consisting of parachute troops that landed in the eastern part of Drvar where most of the population lived, were also engaged in heavy fighting. The Young Communist League of Yugoslavia had just finished a conference in Drvar, and many of the delegates were still staying in the town. Many youths took up whatever arms they could obtain and commenced fighting the parachutists who were attempting to establish a cordon on the eastern side of the town. About 2 km further east on the road to Mokronoge was a Partisan officer training school with about 130 students. On hearing the fighting from the direction of Drvar, the students marched west initially armed with only pistols and a few rifles. They split into two groups, a smaller group which crossed the Unac and advanced west along the railway line on the ridge leading toward Tito's cave, and a larger group which collected arms and ammunition from several stray canisters of German equipment dropped by parachute. The larger group of students attacked Green and Blue Groups from the east around 08:00, suffering severe casualties, but maintained continuous pressure on the German flank. About 09:00, the Germans had largely secured Drvar, and the available troops went from house to house, armed with photographs of Tito, brutally questioning the civilians they could find. Soon after this commenced, Rybka realised that Partisan resistance was concentrated to the north in the vicinity of the cave. He therefore fired the red signal flare to rally his troops for an assault in that direction. =Assault on Tito's cave and the Partisan counterattack= Tito's cave headquarters in 1990 At about 10:30, Rybka launched a frontal attack across the Unac supported by at least one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Before this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave. While Rybka was assembling his troops for this attack, surrounding Partisan forces were rushed toward Drvar. Three battalions of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division approached from the southeast. One battalion attacked the German position at the cemetery while the other two swung around to strike the Germans from the west. About 11:15, after Rybka's first attack had been defeated, Tito and the small group gathered with him escaped from the cave. There was a platform at the mouth of the cave, and they climbed down a rope through a trapdoor in the platform, although the panic displayed by Tito's mistress Davorjanka Paunoviƒá (codenamed \\"Zdenka\\") and his dog caused some delays. The party split up and following a creek leading away from the Unac, the small groups climbed the heights to the east and withdrew toward the village of Potoci. =Second German attack and withdrawal= The second wave of parachute troops was dropped in two groups to the west of the cemetery at about midday. The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans to the west of Drvar, and the paratroops suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties. In the late afternoon, Rybka ordered his forces to withdraw to the area of the cemetery where he formed a defensive perimeter. During the withdrawal, at least one group of troops was cut off and killed. About 18:00, Rybka was wounded by a grenade blast and was later evacuated with other casualties in the light aircraft intended to carry away Tito after his capture. Roughly at the same time, his Partisan counterpart in Drvar, Milan ≈†ijan, the commander of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade, was also wounded by German machine gun fire. By 21:30, the Germans had consolidated their position in the cemetery, although they were completely surrounded by the Partisans. During the night, the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade attacked the cemetery, with the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the 9th Dalmatian Division reinforcing the assault. At 03:30 on 26 May, the final Partisan attack was launched against the cemetery, breaching the walls in several places, but the paratroopers held on. =Ground force assault and Partisan withdrawal= alt=map showing the ground assault on Drvar by Although its total strength was estimated at 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army was not able to rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation R√∂sselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was to hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation R√∂sselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory. 25 May Throughout 25 May, the ground forces of XV Mountain Corps were not able to advance as quickly as planned. There was unexpected resistance from the Partisan 1st Proletarian, 5th and 8th Corps along their axes of advance, and there was very poor communication and coordination between the columns. The ground forces were also subjected to Allied air attacks by Air Vice-Marshal William Elliot's Balkan Air Force throughout the day, called in by the British mission using their surviving radio. alt=map showing the ground assault on Drvar by the 92nd Motorised Regiment At 05:00 on 25 May, commenced its attack from Srb in an easterly direction, aiming to cover the to Drvar as quickly as possible. It encountered organised resistance from the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division. After a day's fighting, the Germans had captured Trubar, but were unable to overcome the defences of the hills east of the village. Recognising the importance of 's task, the commander of the 373th Division, Eduard Aldrian, ordered the battalion group of the 373th Division to abandon its advance from Lapac to Martin Brod and reinforce instead. The remaining brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division, the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade, was deployed to the north along the Una river. The 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade requested assistance from the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade, but divisional headquarters ordered it to send reinforcements to Drvar instead. At 21:00, the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade launched a successful local counterattack on the vanguard of , separating it from the main body. Willam then decided to halt the advance and place the remaining units into all-round defence. At 22:25, Aldrian ordered him to resume the attack, but Willam reported that this was impossible due to loss of contact with his own units. The 92nd Motorised Regiment consisted of two columns, a western column based on the 92nd Motorised Regiment, and an eastern column consisting of the 54th Reconnaissance Battalion and 1st Home Guard J√§ger Regiment of the 2nd Croatian Light Infantry Brigade. The western column advanced southeast from Bihaƒá, and encountered resistance from the 6th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division. By the end of the day, the western column had reached Vrtoƒçe, halfway between Bihaƒá and Bosanski Petrovac. Being fully motorised, it used its mobility to outmanoeuvre the Partisans, bypassing their main defensive positions to the west, the Cossack pioneers playing an important role in keeping the column moving. The eastern column started its advance from Bosanska Krupa, aiming to establish contact with the western column at Vrtoƒçe. It advanced 10 km before being held up by the defences of the 8th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division. alt=map showing the ground assault on Drvar by elements of the 7th SS Division The forces commanded by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern, central and southern columns. The northern column consisted of and included a company of tanks. It moved swiftly southwest from its start point near Banja Luka, and had reached ƒåaƒëavica (at a crossroads halfway between Mrkonjiƒá Grad and Kljuƒç) by the evening of 25 May, brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance. The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence. The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from ƒåaƒëavica to Kljuƒç to prevent the loss of Kljuƒç, but only one battalion of the brigade managed to reach that position by dawn on 26 May. The central column consisted of the 7th SS Reconnaissance Battalion reinforced with one battery of self-propelled guns, which had a special task: it was to strike from Mrkonjiƒá Grad, penetrate deeply into the Partisans‚Äô rear and destroy the HQ of the 5th Partisan Corps in Ribnik. Despite having only two battalions in the area (the third was facing at ƒåaƒëavica), the 13th Proletarian Brigade managed to hold off this thrust. The southern column was based on the 13th SS Mountain Regiment, reinforced by I Battalion of the 7th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment and some Chetniks. This column launched its assault from the Jajce area, and had the task of reaching Mlini≈°ta (20 km south of Kljuƒç). By 17:20, II Battalion of the 13th SS Mountain Regiment had taken ≈†ipovo, but any further advance was halted by the defences of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. alt=map showing the ground assault by two German reconnaissance battalions The Germans deployed two columns to attack north from Livno. The 369th Reconnaissance Battalion with some 200 men from the 6th Usta≈°a Brigade advanced towards Glamoƒç, and the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion with a panzer company thrust in the direction of Bosansko Grahovo. By 16:00 on 25 May 1944, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column had reached the village of Han-Vrbe, some 5 km from Bosansko Grahovo. At that point, it was attacked by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was forced to retreat. During the retreat, this column was attacked by two more battalions of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was pushed back to its start line at Livno with heavy losses. A preliminary German report estimated their losses at 50, but the 3rd Krajina Brigade estimated German losses at 191 dead and wounded. The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion column overcame the resistance of local Partisan units and the 1st and 4th Battalions of the 13th Dalmatian Brigade, and by the end of the day had reached Crni Lug, some 20 km from Bosansko Grahovo. In the evening, the 13th Dalmatian Brigade was ordered to march towards Tiƒçevo and Drvar to reinforce the Partisan forces in that area. The 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, reinforced by a pioneer company from the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and the Chetnik Dinara Division, attacked along the Knin‚ÄìBosansko Grahovo axis, pushed back the local Grahovo‚ÄìPeulje Partisan Detachment and by the end of the day had reached positions some 5 km beyond Strmica. Escorted by elements of the 3rd Krajina Brigade, Tito made his way to Potoci, where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. At Potoci, they were met by the staff of the Allied military missions. The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio. Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres. The 2nd Panzer Army was monitoring the operation closely. The report of a special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans‚Äô rear with the help of disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According to this report, received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, several pioneers, and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night, it tried again the following night. 26‚Äì27 May About 05:00 on 26 May, a Luftwaffe fighter-bomber formation engaged the Partisan troops withdrawing from Drvar. The western column of the 92nd Motorised Regiment was ordered to help assist the eastern column by detaching a reinforced panzer company from Vrtoƒçe. On the morning of 26 May, the German columns advancing from Bihaƒá towards Kljuƒç, and from Livno and Knin towards Bosansko Grahovo, overcame the Partisan units in their paths, and continued their advance facing little resistance. The 92nd Motorised Grenadier Regiment, advancing from Vrtoƒçe, took Bosanski Petrovac without a fight about 08:00. It continued its march to Drvar and relieved the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at 12:45. established radio contact with the 500th SS Battalion around 07:00, and at 17:00 entered Drvar via Kamenica. The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion arrived at Bosansko Grahovo at 10:30, where it was joined by the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division at 16:00. entered Kljuƒç at 14:15. In the eastern sector, the Partisan line of defence was still holding. During 26 and 27 May, the 7th SS Division continued exerting strong pressure on the 1st Proletarian Division in the upper Sana River Valley, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. By the end of 27 May, the front line had stabilised to the north and south of Ribnik. After the defeat it had suffered the previous day, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column did not resume its advance towards Glamoƒç on the 26th. On 26 May, due to the rapidly changing situation and communications difficulties, a degree of confusion emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihaƒá-Bosanski Petrovac road, even though the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Bosanski Petrovac-Kljuƒç road to the south was left unguarded, endangering Tito and Partisan Supreme Headquarters as they fled from Drvar. XV Mountain Corps failed to recognise and exploit these flaws in Partisan deployments. After the 500th Parachute Battalion had been relieved, the XV Mountain Corps ordered the units in the Drvar area to disperse. The 92nd Motorised Regiment with all subordinated units was ordered to return north and attack the brigades of the 4th Krajina Division on Mount Grmeƒç, to secure the main supply road from Bihaƒá to Bosanski Petrovac; this action, codenamed \\"Grmeƒç\\", was scheduled to start on the morning of 27 May. The 373rd Division with the newly subordinated 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division was ordered to conduct a sweep-and- destroy operation in the area south and southeast of Drvar; this operation was codenamed \\"Vijenac\\", and was to take place concurrently with \\"Operation Grmeƒç\\". The 9th Dalmatian Division managed to repulse all attacks on 27 May, pushing the Brandenburgers and Chetniks back to Bosansko Grahovo. On 27 May, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column again tried to advance on Glamoƒç, but with no success. Unhappy with the development of the operation to this point, Rendulic cancelled Operations \\"Grmeƒç\\" and \\"Vijenac\\" on the afternoon of 27 May, and ordered von Leyser to move all units back to their start positions for a concentric attack on the area where Tito and two Partisan corps headquarters (1st Proletarian and 5th) were believed to be located. The attack was scheduled to begin on the morning of 28 May. Rendulic also sent the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion to the Livno-Glamoƒç area which had been left wide open by the defeat of the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion thrust. Tito, his staff and his escort continued toward Kupres, travelling on foot and horseback, as well as on the wagons of a narrow-gauge logging railway. During this trek, one of the members of the Soviet mission was wounded by shellfire. Aftermath Unable to capture Tito, the Germans did find his marshal's uniform in Drvar, and later placed it on display in Vienna. Throughout their escape, the British mission were able to maintain contact with their headquarters via radio and continued to call in support from the Balkan Air Force against the German formations taking part in Operation R√∂sselsprung and the Luftwaffe aircraft in the skies over Yugoslavia. This included over one thousand sorties. A costly ground attack was also launched by a combined Partisan, British and United States force on the German-held Dalmatian island of Braƒç. Code-named \\"Operation Flounced\\", the assault was mounted from the British-held island of Vis further out in the Adriatic Sea on the night of 1/2 June. Fighting continued late into 3 June 1944 and resulted in the reinforcement of the island by a further 1,900 German troops. After three days of fighting, the combined forces returned to Vis. The Partisans suffered losses of 67 dead, 308 wounded and 14 missing, and Allied units suffered 60 dead, 74 wounded and 20 missing, with the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Churchill, being captured by the Germans. After six days evading the Germans, the leader of the Soviet mission, Lieutenant General Nikolai Vasilevich Korneev, who had lost a leg in the Battle of Stalingrad, suggested an air evacuation of Tito and the Soviet mission and this was expanded by Street to include the whole party. After three days deliberation, Tito agreed on 3 June and Street arranged the evacuation the same night from an RAF- operated airfield near the town of Kupres. Seven Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft, one with a Soviet crew and the remainder with US crew, carried Tito and his party, the Allied missions and 118 wounded Partisans to Bari in Italy. Late on 6 June, Tito was delivered by the Royal Navy escort destroyer to Vis, where he re-established his headquarters and was joined by the Allied missions. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, believed that the British had known more about the attack than they claimed, based on the absence of both Maclean and Churchill from Drvar at the time of the attack. On 28 May, he sent a message to Korneev detailing his suspicions. Although Tito's headquarters, along with several other Partisan organisations, was temporarily disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control within a few weeks of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault. The operation failed due to several factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the German intelligence agencies to share the limited information available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force. The 500th SS Parachute Battalion was decimated during Operation R√∂sselsprung, suffering 576 killed and 48 wounded. Only 200 soldiers of the battalion were fit to fight on the morning of 26 May. It continued throughout the rest of the war as the only SS parachute unit, although its name was later changed to the 600th SS Parachute Battalion. Operation R√∂sselsprung was its only combat parachute operation. According to a German report, the ground troops of XV Mountain Corps suffered 213 killed, 881 wounded, and 51 missing during Operation R√∂sselsprung. The same report claimed that 6,000 Partisans were killed. The commander of the 7th SS Division, Otto Kumm claimed that Partisan losses included 1,916 confirmed and another 1,400 estimated killed, and 161 taken prisoner. Kumm also claimed that six Allied aircraft were shot down during the operation. According to a Partisan source, their total losses were 399 killed, 479 wounded, and at least 85 missing. Of this total, the casualties suffered in fighting with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at Drvar numbered 179 killed, 63 wounded, and 19 missing. Ultimately, according to intelligence historian Ralph Bennett, \\"[t]he long-term significance of the Drvar raid was simply that it failed.\\" Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful attempt on his life. In film Operation R√∂sselsprung was depicted in the 1963 Partisan film directed by Fadil Had≈æiƒá.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the Cobra Emperor and was introduced in 1986. In the original 1980s animated series, he is the main antagonist in the second season. Fictional character biography Serpentor was designed to be the ultimate Cobra leader. Doctor Mindbender and Destro combed the tombs of the greatest leaders in history to find cells with DNA traces. These long-dead genetic blueprints were combined to produce a clone with the genius of Napoleon, the ruthlessness of Julius Caesar, the daring of Hannibal, and the shrewdness of Attila the Hun, and the aggressiveness and impulsiveness of Sergeant Slaughter. Serpentor is a brilliant tactician and a master of political intrigue, and was eventually capable of wresting control over Cobra from Cobra Commander. Toys Serpentor was first released as an action figure in 1986, packaged with the Air Chariot. The Air Chariot is like a flying throne, with two 7.62mm attack guns, reinforced battle shield, and hover engine. He was released in 2002 as a re-issue 2-pack that was exclusive to online retailers. A new mold of Serpentor was released in 2005, as part of a comic three pack, which included a reprint of issue #49 of the Marvel Comics series. Serpentor was released again in 2007 as a single carded figure as part of the 25th anniversary series. This figure was also packaged with a re-release of the Air Chariot in a vehicle 2 pack, and with a DVD set that included the DVD of \\"Arise, Serpentor, Arise\\". Comics =Marvel Comics= In the Marvel Comics series, Serpentor initially appeared in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #49 (July 1986). The character in the comics was created as a \\"super soldier\\", intended to lead and inspire the troops while Cobra Commander remained in power. His creation involved Cobra collecting genetic material from various historical figures. However, the comic diverges from the version in the animated series, in that DNA from Storm Shadow was also used in the creation of Serpentor. He was also portrayed as having something akin to multiple personalities as a result of being created from the DNA of multiple tyrants. In another incident, he was able to access memories of one of his genetic forebears. He recalls the invention of pizza, informing a group of Dreadnoks.G.I. Joe Yearbook #3 (March 1987) While his relationship in the comics was meant to be more of a figurehead, Serpentor was ambitious, leading to power struggles between him and other members of Cobra. Serpentor contended with Cobra Commander impostor Fred VII, and the two were often at odds. Their rivalry eventually escalated into the Cobra civil war, in which G.I. Joe was ordered to side with Serpentor to defeat the forces of Fred and the Baroness. During the conflict, Serpentor met his end at the hands of Zartan, and was killed by an arrow to the head (Memory recalled in issue #25), in G.I. Joe A Real American Hero #76 (September, 1988). =Other versions= Devil's Due Publishing Devil's Due continued the storyline of the Marvel series, and years after the events that led to Serpentor's death, his body was found and reanimated by renegade scientists. Soon a secretive faction called The Coil formed. Serpentor targeted G.I. Joe and Cobra forces alike. G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers: The Art of War (Vol 3) Serpentor in the G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers crossover published by Devil's Due Publishing has a very different origin. In the third G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers miniseries, the US government builds an android called \\"Serpent OR\\", using processors taken from Megatron and programmed with information on Earth and Cybertron's greatest war-leaders. Serpent OR, seeing himself as Megatron's son and heir, sets out on a quest to gain the Matrix for himself, believing it will grant him the power he needed to rule. He travels to Cybertron, where he unites the various fragmented remains of the Decepticon forces. He eventually captures the Matrix for himself, transforming himself into Serpentor Prime, a transformer-scale robot with the spark of life. This results in rethinking his strategy to conquer, but Cobra Commander takes over Serpentor Prime's body with a remote control device that was planted back on Earth. His rampage did not last long, as Hawk was able to open the Matrix, transforming Hawk into a mighty leader and rendering the Commander comatose. Serpent OR's exact fate beyond this is unknown. Transformers: Timelines The Official Transformer Fan Collectors Club's third Figure Subscription set included a human-made Transformer created by a former Cobra agent who sought to upload the data from the Serpentor project into the body of a deceased Sweep. However, as a result of an attack by the Earth Defense Command on this operation, the personality of Clayton \\"Hawk\\" Abernathy is added to Serpent O.R.'s programming, creating a Transformer known as Serpent O.R. with feelings of loyalty to Cobra, the Decepticons, AND the Earth Defense Command. =IDW Publishing= In the IDW continuity, Serpentor's real name is Stephen Minasian and he is the leader of the Coil, the religious wing of Cobra and a highly influential cult that is known to the public as a self-help group. The Coil worship a god named Golobulus (also called Gola-Bulas), who created a paradise called Cobra-La before human ignorance destroyed it. Serpentor claims to be the Final Disciple of Golobulus, a reincarnation of the best qualities of the god's previous champions such as Napoleon and Alexander the Great. Serpentor is a member of the Cobra Council, the ruling body that elects the Cobra Commander (who outranks Serpentor). In the case of a new Commander needing to be elected, Serpentor's view \\"carries a ton of weight. If he is backing someone, then their stock will clearly go up in the eyes of the Cobra Court\\". Serpentor isn't interested in becoming the new Commander and, during the contest to decide the new leader, starts assisting the Baroness, Major Bludd and Tomax in getting the role - that way, the eventual leader will \\"need me\\".Cobra: Cobra Civil War #2 Animated series =Sunbow= Serpentor appears as the main antagonist in the second season of the original 1980s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero animated series. Serpentor first appeared in a five-part G.I. Joe episode \\"Arise, Serpentor, Arise!\\", voiced by Dick Gautier. The animated version of Serpentor was designed to be a new, superior leader of Cobra created by Doctor Mindbender through a breakthrough in cloning research. He was conceived as the perfect warrior, extracted from the unearthed remains of some of the greatest generals of all time as well as other notable historic figures--Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Attila the Hun, Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the Impaler, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, Grigori Rasputin, Montezuma, Geronimo, Eric the Red and Egyptian general Xanuth Amon-Toth. In the animated continuity, Sun Tzu's DNA was also intended to be part of Serpentor's creation, but the attempt to obtain his DNA was thwarted by Sgt. Slaughter, whose DNA was then intended for use as a substitute. The first attempt to create Serpentor was sabotaged by Cobra Commander, who secretly dumped a mutant virus into the Sgt. Slaughter DNA chamber, causing a monster that rampaged throughout Cobra Island until it dissolved. During Doctor Mindbender's second attempt, Cobra Commander is betrayed by Scrap-Iron (who told Doctor Mindbender what had happened). Upon the recapture of Sgt. Slaughter, the creation is a success and Serpentor is born. As a result of Sun Tzu's DNA being missing, Serpentor is very intolerant and overbearing. He issues most of his orders with the phrase \\"This I command!\\" He also shows some of Slaughter's willingness to lead from the front lines, in contrast to Cobra Commander. Mere moments after his birth and being given his distinctive costume, he accepts a challenge from Slaughter, and the two battle throughout the Terror Drome, where Serpentor shows off the strength he inherited from Slaughter's DNA during the fight. However, without the methodical Sun Tzu's influence, Serpentor is also prone to impulsiveness, as shown in his first major act‚Äîleading Cobra in an attack upon Washington, D.C. He succeeded in capturing the city and demanded the surrender of the President (who was out of town with the Vice-President at the time), Congress and G.I. Joe. The G.I. Joe members managed a sneak attack on Cobra, turning the operation into a complete fiasco, but just as the Joes are about to capture Serpentor, a sudden burst of fire drives them back. It comes from Cobra Commander, who convinced Mindbender to free him, because he knew how to use a weapon. Cobra Commander convinced Serpentor to let him be his scapegoat since there would be no one to do the punishing for him. A later episode \\"My Favorite Things\\" reveals that Serpentor can assume the facial features of those whose DNA are included in his genetic composition. In addition, a few more donors to Serpentor's creation are revealed: a Viking warrior known as \\"Ulrik the Batterer\\", and the reptilian king \\"Takshaka\\" from Indian mythology. =G.I. Joe: The Movie= In G.I. Joe: The Movie, Serpentor is contacted by Pythona, an emissary of the ancient culture \\"Cobra-La\\". She informs him of the need to steal the Broadcast Energy Transmitter (B.E.T.). During the attack to obtain the B.E.T., Serpentor is wounded and left to be captured by G.I. Joe. Aided by Cobra-La, Cobra forces are later dispatched to rescue Serpentor and bring him to the hidden kingdom of Cobra-La. After Serpentor's arrival at the ancient kingdom, Cobra-La's supreme ruler Golobulus informs the Cobra leadership present that it was he who implanted the idea of creating Serpentor in Doctor Mindbender's brain with a biological organism called a \\"psychic motivator\\". Along with the other Cobra hierarchy, Serpentor accepts Golobulus's authority and vows to fulfill his goal of destroying human civilization. During an attack to acquire the B.E.T. from G.I. Joe headquarters, Serpentor severely injures Duke causing Duke to slip into a coma. During the climatic attack on Cobra-La, Serpentor is defeated by Duke's half-brother Lt. Falcon when the Cobra emperor's cape gets caught in his air chariot's engine turbine. Serpentor is last seen flying out of control on his air chariot, struggling to get himself free of his cape. =DiC= Serpentor appeared in the DiC-produced G.I. Joe miniseries, G.I. Joe: Operation Dragonfire, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. He reorganizes Cobra with Destro, Baroness, Scoop, Zarana and Copperhead returning to the team. In the series, Serpentor attempted to harness the mythical power known as Dragonfire, but was unaware of Cobra Commander's return. In the ensuing civil war, Serpentor was captured by Cobra Commander and his Python Patrol. Cobra Commander then used his Pythonizing Ray made from a part of the Dragonfire he obtained to combine Serpentor with Gnawgahyde's pet iguana. Cobra Commander stated that the effects will be temporary and that by the time he changes back, he'll have a taste for flies. He was last seen running off into the jungle in his iguana form with Gnawgahyde chasing after him, Gnawgahyde threatening to barbecue Serpentor. Serpentor is not seen again in the DiC series, leaving it unclear if Serpentor successfully escaped or Gnawgahyde enacted his threats. =G.I. Joe: Renegades= In G.I. Joe: Renegades, Serpentor is the name of a giant cobra who belongs to Cobra Commander. Created by Doctor Mindbender as a gift to Cobra Commander, the Serpentor cobra possesses enough intelligence to follow basic commands and even swallow any human that angers Cobra Commander as well as spit them back out on cue if Cobra Commander decides to let that person live.

This was carried through the Five-Year Plans, developed, executed, and monitored by the Planning Commission (1951-2014) and the NITI Aayog (2015-2017). With the prime minister as the ex-officio chairman, the commission has a nominated deputy chairman, who holds the rank of a cabinet minister. Montek Singh Ahluwalia is the last deputy chairman of the commission (resigned on 26 May 2014). The Twelfth Plan completed its term in March 2017.Planning Commission, Government of India: Five Year Plans. Planningcommission.nic.in. Retrieved on 2012-03-17. Prior to the Fourth Plan, the allocation of state resources was based on schematic patterns rather than a transparent and objective mechanism, which led to the adoption of the Gadgil formula in 1969. Revised versions of the formula have been used since then to determine the allocation of central assistance for state plans. The new government led by Narendra Modi, elected in 2014, has announced the dissolution of the Planning Commission, and its replacement by a think tank called the NITI Aayog (an acronym for National Institution for Transforming India). History Five-Year Plans (FYPs) are centralized and integrated national economic programs. Joseph Stalin implemented the first Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union in 1928. Most communist states and several capitalist countries subsequently have adopted them. China continues to use FYPs, although China renamed its Eleventh FYP, from 2006 to 2010, a guideline (guihua), rather than a plan (jihua), to signify the central government's more hands-off approach to development. India launched its First FYP in 1951, immediately after independence, under the socialist influence of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.Sony Pellissery and Sam Geall \\"Five Year Plans\\". Encyclopedia of Sustainability. Volume 7 pp. 156‚Äì160 The First Five- Year Plan was one of the most important, because it had a great role in the launching of Indian development after Independence. Thus, it strongly supported agriculture production and also launched the industrialization of the country (but less than the Second Plan, which focused on heavy industries). It built a particular system of mixed economy, with a great role for the public sector (with an emerging welfare state), as well as a growing private sector (represented by some personalities as those who published the Bombay Plan). First Plan (1951‚Äì1956) The first Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, presented the First Five-Year Plan to the Parliament of India and needed urgent attention. The First Five-year Plan was launched in 1951 which mainly focused in development of the primary sector. The First Five-Year Plan was based on the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model with few modifications. The total planned budget of Rs.2069 crore (2378 crore later) was allocated to seven broad areas: irrigation and energy (27.2%), agriculture and community development (17.4%), transport and communications (24%), industry (8.4%), social services (16.6%), rehabilitation of landless farmers (4.1%), and for other sectors and services (2.5%). The most important feature of this phase was active role of state in all economic sectors. Such a role was justified at that time because immediately after independence, India was facing basic problems‚Äîdeficiency of capital and low capacity to save. The target growth rate was 2.1% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth; the achieved growth rate was 3.6% the net domestic product went up by 15%. The monsoon was good and there were relatively high crop yields, boosting exchange reserves and the per capita income, which increased by 8%. National income increased more than the per capita income due to rapid population growth. Many irrigation projects were initiated during this period, including the Bhakra, Hirakud, Mettur Dam and Damodar Valley dams. The World Health Organization (WHO), with the Indian government, addressed children's health and reduced infant mortality, indirectly contributing to population growth. At the end of the plan period in 1956, five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were started as major technical institutions. The University Grants Commission (UGC) was set up to take care of funding and take measures to strengthen the higher education in the country. Contracts were signed to start five steel plants, which came into existence in the middle of the Second Five-Year Plan. The plan was quasi- successful for the government. Second Plan (1956‚Äì1961) The Second Plan focused on the development of the public sector and \\"rapid Industrialisation\\". The plan followed the Mahalanobis model, an economic development model developed by the Indian statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth. It used the prevalent state-of-the-art techniques of operations research and optimization as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at the Indian Statistical Institute. The plan assumed a closed economy in which the main trading activity would be centred on importing capital goods.Jalal Alamgir, India's Open-Economy Policy: Globalism, Rivalry, Continuity (London and New York: Routledge 2008), Chapter 2.Baldev Raj Nayar, Globalization And Nationalism: The Changing Balance Of India's Economic Policy, 1950‚Äì2000 (New Delhi: Sage, 2001). Hydroelectric power projects and five steel plants at Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela were established with the help of Russia, Britain (the U.K) and West Germany respectively. Coal production was increased. More railway lines were added in the north east. The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Atomic Energy Commission of India were established as research institutes. In 1957, a talent search and scholarship program was begun to find talented young students to train for work in nuclear power. The total amount allocated under the Second Five-Year Plan in India was Rs.48 billion. This amount was allocated among various sectors: power and irrigation, social services, communications and transport, and miscellaneous. The second plan was a period of rising prices. The country also faced foreign exchange crisis. The rapid growth in population slowed down the growth in the per capita income. The target growth rate was 4.5% and the actual growth rate was 4.27%. The plan was criticized by classical liberal economist B.R. Shenoy who noted that the plan's \\"dependence on deficit financing to promote heavy industrialization was a recipe for trouble\\". Shenoy argued that state control of the economy would undermine a young democracy. India faced an external payments crisis in 1957, which is viewed as confirmation of Shenoy's argument.  Third Plan (1961‚Äì1966)  The Third Five-year Plan stressed agriculture and improvement in the production of wheat, but the brief Sino-Indian War of 1962 exposed weaknesses in the economy and shifted the focus towards the defence industry and the Indian Army. In 1965‚Äì1966, India fought a War with Pakistan. There was also a severe drought in 1965. The war led to inflation and the priority was shifted to price stabilisation. The construction of dams continued. Many cement and fertilizer plants were also built. Punjab began producing an abundance of wheat. Many primary schools were started in rural areas. In an effort to bring democracy to the grass-root level, Panchayat elections were started and the states were given more development responsibilities. State electricity boards and state secondary education boards were formed. States were made responsible for secondary and higher education. State road transportation corporations were formed and local road building became a state responsibility. The target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth rate was 2.4%.  Plan Holidays (1966‚Äì1969)  Due to miserable failure of the Third Plan the government was forced to declare \\"plan holidays\\" (from 1966‚Äì67, 1967‚Äì68, and 1968‚Äì69). Three annual plans were drawn during this intervening period. During 1966‚Äì67 there was again the problem of drought. Equal priority was given to agriculture, its allied activities, and industrial sector. The government of India declared \\"Devaluation of Rupee\\" to increase the exports of the country. The main reasons for plan holidays were the war, lack of resources and increase in inflation. Fourth Plan (1969‚Äì1974) At this time Indira Gandhi was the prime minister. The Indira Gandhi government nationalised 14 major Indian banks and the Green Revolution in India advanced agriculture. In addition, the situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was becoming dire as the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War took funds earmarked for industrial development. India also performed the Smiling Buddha underground nuclear test (Pokhran-1) in Rajasthan on May 18, 1974, partially in response to the United States deployment of the Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal. The fleet had been deployed to warn India against attacking West Pakistan and extending the war. The target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth rate was 3.3%.  Fifth Plan (1974‚Äì1978)  The Fifth Five-Year Plan laid stress on employment, poverty alleviation (Garibi Hatao), and justice. The plan also focused on self-reliance in agricultural production and defence. In 1978 the newly elected Morarji Desai government rejected the plan. The Electricity Supply Act was amended in 1975, which enabled the central government to enter into power generation and transmission. The Indian national highway system was introduced and many roads were widened to accommodate the increasing traffic. Tourism also expanded. The twenty-point programme was launched in 1975. It was followed from 1974 to 1979. The Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) was introduced in the first year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974‚Äì78). The objective of the programme is to provide certain basic minimum needs and thereby improve the living standards of the people. It is prepared and launched by D.P.Dhar. The target growth rate was 4.4% and the actual growth rate was 4.8%.  Rolling Plan (1978‚Äì1980)  The Janata Party government rejected the Fifth Five-Year Plan and introduced a new Sixth Five-Year Plan (1978‚Äì1980). This plan was again rejected by the Indian National Congress government in 1980 and a new Sixth Plan was made. The Rolling Plan consisted of three kinds of plans that were proposed. The First Plan was for the present year which comprised the annual budget and the Second was a plan for a fixed number of years, which may be 3, 4 or 5 years. The Second Plan kept changing as per the requirements of the Indian economy. The Third Plan was a perspective plan for long terms i.e. for 10, 15 or 20 years. Hence there was no fixation of dates for the commencement and termination of the plan in the rolling plans. The main advantage of the rolling plans was that they were flexible and were able to overcome the rigidity of fixed Five-Year Plans by mending targets, the object of the exercise, projections and allocations as per the changing conditions in the country's economy. The main disadvantage of this plan was that if the targets were revised each year, it became difficult to achieve the targets laid down in the five-year period and it turned out to be a complex plan. Also, the frequent revisions resulted in the lack of stability in the economy.  Sixth Plan (1980‚Äì1985)  The Sixth Five-Year Plan marked the beginning of economic liberalisation. Price controls were eliminated and ration shops were closed. This led to an increase in food prices and an increase in the cost of living. This was the end of Nehruvian socialism. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development was established for development of rural areas on 12 July 1982 by recommendation of the Shivaraman Committee. Family planning was also expanded in order to prevent overpopulation. In contrast to China's strict and binding one-child policy, Indian policy did not rely on the threat of force . More prosperous areas of India adopted family planning more rapidly than less prosperous areas, which continued to have a high birth rate. Military Five-Year Plans became coterminous with Planning Commission's plans from this plan onwards.https://idsa.in/idsacomments/13th-five-year-defence- plan-2017-22_acowshish_310717 The Sixth Five-Year Plan was a great success to the Indian economy. The target growth rate was 5.2% and the actual growth rate was 5.7%.  Seventh Plan (1985‚Äì1990)  The Seventh Five-Year Plan was led by the Congress Party with Rajiv Gandhi as the prime minister. The plan laid stress on improving the productivity level of industries by upgrading of technology. The main objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan were to establish growth in areas of increasing economic productivity, production of food grains, and generating employment through \\"Social Justice\\". As an outcome of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there had been steady growth in agriculture, controls on the rate of inflation, and favourable balance of payments which had provided a strong base for the Seventh Five-Year Plan to build on the need for further economic growth. The Seventh Plan had strived towards socialism and energy production at large. The thrust areas of the Seventh Five-Year Plan were: social justice, removal of oppression of the weak, using modern technology, agricultural development, anti-poverty programmes, full supply of food, clothing, and shelter, increasing productivity of small- and large-scale farmers, and making India an independent economy. Based on a 15-year period of striving towards steady growth, the Seventh Plan was focused on achieving the prerequisites of self-sustaining growth by the year 2000. The plan expected the labour force to grow by 39 million people and employment was expected to grow at the rate of 4% per year. Some of the expected outcomes of the Seventh Five-Year Plan India are given below: * Balance of payments (estimates): Export ‚Äì , Imports ‚Äì (-), Trade Balance ‚Äì (-) * Merchandise exports (estimates): * Merchandise imports (estimates): * Projections for balance of payments: Export ‚Äì , Imports ‚Äì (-) , Trade Balance- (-) Under the Seventh Five-Year Plan, India strove to bring about a self-sustained economy in the country with valuable contributions from voluntary agencies and the general populace. The target growth rate was 5.0% and the actual growth rate was 6.01%.http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol1/v1c2-1.htm and the growth rate of per capita income was 3.7%. Annual Plans (1990‚Äì1992) The Eighth Plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing economic situation at the centre and the years 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92 were treated as Annual Plans. The Eighth Plan was finally formulated for the period 1992‚Äì1997. Eighth Plan (1992‚Äì1997) 1989‚Äì91 was a period of economic instability in India and hence no Five-Year Plan was implemented. Between 1990 and 1992, there were only Annual Plans. In 1991, India faced a crisis in foreign exchange (forex) reserves, left with reserves of only about 1 billion. Thus, under pressure, the country took the risk of reforming the socialist economy. P.V. Narasimha Rao was the ninth prime minister of the Republic of India and head of Congress Party, and led one of the most important administrations in India's modern history, overseeing a major economic transformation and several incidents affecting national security. At that time Dr. Manmohan Singh (later prime minister of India) launched India's free market reforms that brought the nearly bankrupt nation back from the edge. It was the beginning of liberalization, privatisation and globalization (LPG) in India. Modernization of industries was a major highlight of the Eighth Plan. Under this plan, the gradual opening of the Indian economy was undertaken to correct the burgeoning deficit and foreign debt. Meanwhile, India became a member of the World Trade Organization on 1 January 1995. The major objectives included, controlling population growth, poverty reduction, employment generation, strengthening the infrastructure, institutional building, tourism management, human resource development, involvement of Panchayati rajs, Nagar Palikas, NGOs, decentralisation and people's participation. Energy was given priority with 26.6% of the outlay. The target growth rate was 5.6% and the actual growth rate was 6.8%. To achieve the target of an average of 5.6% per annum, investment of 23.2% of the gross domestic product was required. The incremental capital ratio is 4.1. The saving for investment was to come from domestic sources and foreign sources, with the rate of domestic saving at 21.6% of gross domestic production and of foreign saving at 1.6% of gross domestic production.  Ninth Plan (1997‚Äì2002)  The Ninth Five-Year Plan came after 50 years of Indian Independence. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister of India during the Ninth Plan. The Ninth Plan tried primarily to use the latent and unexplored economic potential of the country to promote economic and social growth. It offered strong support to the social spheres of the country in an effort to achieve the complete elimination of poverty. The satisfactory implementation of the Eighth Five-Year Plan also ensured the states' ability to proceed on the path of faster development. The Ninth Five- Year Plan also saw joint efforts from the public and the private sectors in ensuring economic development of the country. In addition, the Ninth Five-Year Plan saw contributions towards development from the general public as well as governmental agencies in both the rural and urban areas of the country. New implementation measures in the form of Special Action Plans (SAPs) were evolved during the Ninth Plan to fulfill targets within the stipulated time with adequate resources. The SAPs covered the areas of social infrastructure, agriculture, information technology and Water policy. Budget The Ninth Five- Year Plan had a total public sector plan outlay of . The Ninth Five-Year Plan also saw a hike of 48% in terms of plan expenditure and 33% in terms of the plan outlay in comparison to that of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. In the total outlay, the share of the center was approximately 57% while it was 43% for the states and the union territories. The Ninth Five-Year Plan focused on the relationship between the rapid economic growth and the quality of life for the people of the country. The prime focus of this plan was to increase growth in the country with an emphasis on social justice and equity. The Ninth Five-Year Plan placed considerable importance on combining growth oriented policies with the mission of achieving the desired objective of improving policies which would work towards the improvement of the poor in the country. The Ninth Plan also aimed at correcting the historical inequalities which were still prevalent in the society. Objectives The main objective of the Ninth Five-Year Plan was to correct historical inequalities and increase the economic growth in the country. Other aspects which constituted the Ninth Five-Year Plan were: * Population control. * Generating employment by giving priority to agriculture and rural development. * Reduction of poverty. * Ensuring proper availability of food and water for the poor. * Availability of primary health care facilities and other basic necessities. * Primary education to all children in the country. * Empowering the socially disadvantaged classes like Scheduled castes, Scheduled tribes and other backward classes. * Developing self-reliance in terms of agriculture. * Acceleration in the growth rate of the economy with the help of stable prices. Strategies * Structural transformations and developments in the Indian economy. * New initiatives and initiation of corrective steps to meet the challenges in the economy of the country. * Efficient use of scarce resources to ensure rapid growth. * Combination of public and private support to increase employment. * Enhancing high rates of export to achieve self-reliance. * Providing services like electricity, telecommunication, railways etc. * Special plans to empower the socially disadvantaged classes of the country. * Involvement and participation of Panchayati Raj institutions/bodies and Nagar Palikas in the development process. Performance * The Ninth Five-Year Plan achieved a GDP growth rate of 5.4% against a target of 6.5% * The agriculture industry grew at a rate of 2.1% against the target of 4.2% * The industrial growth in the country was 4.5% which was higher than that of the target of 3% * The service industry had a growth rate of 7.8%. * An average annual growth rate of 6.7% was reached. The Ninth Five-Year Plan looks through the past weaknesses in order to frame the new measures for the overall socio-economic development of the country. However, for a well-planned economy of any country, there should be a combined participation of the governmental agencies along with the general population of that nation. A combined effort of public, private, and all levels of government is essential for ensuring the growth of India's economy. The target growth was 7.1% and the actual growth was 6.8%.  Tenth Plan (2002‚Äì2007)  The main objectives of the Tenth Five-Year Plan: *Attain 8% GDP growth per year. *Reduction of poverty rate by 5% by 2007. *Providing gainful and high- quality employment at least to the addition to the labour force. *Reduction in gender gaps in literacy and wage rates by at least 50% by 2007. *20-point program was introduced. *Target growth: 8.1% ‚Äì growth achieved: 7.7%. *The Tenth Plan was expected to follow a regional approach rather than sectoral approach to bring down regional inequalities. *Expenditure of for tenth five years. Out of total plan outlay, (57.9%) was for central government and (42.1%) was for states and union territories. Eleventh Plan (2007‚Äì2012)  *It was in the period of Manmohan Singh as a prime minister. *It aimed to increase the enrolment in higher education of 18‚Äì23 years of age group by 2011‚Äì12. *It focused on distant education, convergence of formal, non-formal, distant and IT education institutions. *Rapid and inclusive growth (poverty reduction). *Emphasis on social sector and delivery of service therein. *Empowerment through education and skill development. *Reduction of gender inequality. *Environmental sustainability. *To increase the growth rate in agriculture, industry and services to 4%, 10% and 9% respectively. *Reduce total fertility rate to 2.1. *Provide clean drinking water for all by 2009. *Increase agriculture growth to 4%.  Twelfth Plan (2012‚Äì2017)  The Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the Government of India has been decided to achieve a growth rate of 8.2% but the National Development Council (NDC) on 27 December 2012 approved a growth rate of 8% for the Twelfth Plan. With the deteriorating global situation, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia has said that achieving an average growth rate of 9 percent in the next five years is not possible. The Final growth target has been set at 8% by the endorsement of the plan at the National Development Council meeting held in New Delhi. \\"It is not possible to think of an average of 9% [in the Twelfth Plan]. I think somewhere between 8 and 8.5 percent is feasible,\\" Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of a conference of State Planning Boards and departments. The approached paper for the Twelfth Plan, approved last year, talked about an annual average growth rate of 9%. \\"When I say feasible... that will require major effort. If you don't do that, there is no God given right to grow at 8 percent. I think given that the world economy deteriorated very sharply over the last year...the growth rate in the first year of the 12th Plan (2012‚Äì13) is 6.5 to 7 percent.\\" He also indicated that soon he should share his views with other members of the Commission to choose a final number (economic growth target) to put before the country's NDC for its approval. The government intends to reduce poverty by 10% during the 12th Five-Year Plan. Ahluwalia said, \\"We aim to reduce poverty estimates by 9% annually on a sustainable basis during the Plan period\\". Earlier, addressing a conference of State Planning Boards and Planning departments, he said the rate of decline in poverty doubled during the Eleventh Plan. The commission had said, while using the Tendulkar poverty line, the rate of reduction in the five years between 2004‚Äì05 and 2009‚Äì10, was about 1.5% points each year, which was twice that when compared to the period between 1993‚Äì95 to 2004‚Äì05. The plan aims towards the betterment of the infrastructural projects of the nation avoiding all types of bottlenecks. The document presented by the planning commission is aimed to attract private investments of up to US$1 trillion in the infrastructural growth in the 12th five-year plan, which will also ensure a reduction in the subsidy burden of the government to 1.5 percent from 2 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product). The UID (Unique Identification Number) will act as a platform for cash transfer of the subsidies in the plan. The objectives of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan were: *To create 50 million new work opportunities in the non farm sector. *To remove gender and social gap in school enrolment. *To enhance access to higher education. *To reduce malnutrition among children aged 0‚Äì3 years. *To provide electricity to all villages. *To ensure that 50% of the rural population have accesses to proper drinking water. *To increase green cover by 1 million hectare every year. *To provide access to banking services to 90% of households.  Future  With the Planning Commission dissolved, no more formal plans are made for the economy, but Five-Year Defence Plans continue to be made. The latest is 2017‚Äì2022. There will be no Thirteenth Five-Year Plan.https://web.archive.org/web/20171005174449/http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/13th- five-year-defence-plan-2017-22_acowshish_310717 See also *Five-Year Plans of China *Five-Year Plans of Romania *Five-Year Plans of the Soviet Union *Common minimum programme  References   External links  *Official website of the Planning Commission of India Category:Economic planning in India Category:Economic history of India Category:Five-year plans Category:Nehru administration ","title":"Five-Year Plans of India"},{"id":"2178171","text":"Ana Kokkinos (born 3 August 1958) is an Australian film and television director and screenwriter of Greek descent.

The main door is large enough to allow horses and carriages to enter the ring, and above the door is an iron wrought balcony that embodies the bullfighting culture. History 1800s image of the Plaza The city of Ronda is home to the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a, the oldest and most noble order of horsemanship in Spain since 1485. In that year, the Catholic King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella won Ronda back from the Moors and ended over seven centuries of Islamic rule. Construction of the bullring started in 1779 and finished in 1785. It stands on the west edge of Ronda, about two blocks from Puente Nuevo and the El Tajo canyon. The design is attributed to the architect Mart√≠n de Aldehuela. While it may not be the oldest bull fighting ring in Spain, it is one of the first entirely constructed from stone, instead of a combination of stone and brick. The architecture is also unique in that all seating in the ring is covered. It is considered a rather small arena with only five thousand seats, but the bull ring itself is the largest in Spain. Ronda's first inaugural bull fighting event in May of 1784 resulted in a partial collapse of the stands, and the structure had to be closed temporarily for repairs. It reopened the next year in May of 1785 with its second inaugural event, which is known as one of the greatest bullfights in Ronda's history. Rivals Pedro Romero and Pepe Hillo faced each other in front of the most noble families in Ronda. In 1923, the original Espinel theater in Ronda was built next to the main entrance of the Plaza de Toros de Ronda. Subsequently the entrance was relocated to Virgen de la Paz, where it still stands across from a restaurant named after the famous Pedro Romero. Later, in the 1980s, the old Espinel theater was demolished and relocated, and it gave way to a parking lot. In 2009, that parking lot was finally removed and the city of Ronda opened up a competition for designers to construct new gardens next to the entrance of the bullfighting ring. Some historians argued that the entrance should be restored in its original locations, but today gardens that embody the golden era of bullfighting in Spain now stretch to a scenic outlook next to the ring. Bullfighters A statue of a bull at the Plaza Soon after the ring's creation in the 18th century, the Romero family of Ronda emerged to provide over three generations of bullfighters. The most important of them was Pedro Romero (1754-1839), a key figure in the history of bullfighting who slew more than 5,600 bulls. The Romero and Ord√≥√±ez families were known for their great bullfights in the Plaza, and bronze statues of Cayetano Ord√≥√±ez and son Antonio Ord√≥√±ez stand outside one of the entrances to the bullring. Ordo√±ez created the Feria Goyesca, a bullfight held the first week of September every year in honor of Pedro Romero. The Ordo√±ez family, widely considered the second bullfighting dynasty of Ronda, participates in the spectacle along with the bullfighters and their assistants. They dress up in costumes reminiscent of the characters in paintings by Spanish romantic painter Francisco Goya. Because of its rural location and the small size of the surrounding town of Ronda, this bullring does not host as many bullfights as other, larger venues: Seville for example. The bullring in Ronda is open to the public, charging a small admission fee. Museum The bullring also houses a museum dedicated to the spectacle. The Museo Taurino holds two centuries of famous bullfighting regalia and important outfits. The collection also includes an extensive amount of weapons used by the Real Maestranza in Spanish war. The museum is open all year expect the week of the Feria in September, and costs 6.5 euros to enter. Panorama of Plaza de toros de Ronda Other uses In 1994, US singer Madonna shot her music video for \\"Take A Bow\\" in the bullfight arena, and planned to invite fans to take part as extras, but just before shooting, that plan was discarded. Madonna's co-star in the video was Spanish bullfighter Emilio Mu√±oz, who played her Latin lover who leaves her after spending a passionate night with the heartbroken blonde. In 2001, the bullring was the location of the final quiz and execution in the first season of the U.S. reality TV show The Mole, hosted by Anderson Cooper.

The major producing country of jute is India, due to its natural fertile soil. Bengal Jute was exported to South East Asia from the 17th century by the Dutch, French and later by other Europeans. By the 1790s a small export had developed to the Scottish city of Dundee, where the flax spinning industry could use a small percentage to lower costs.

The mill owners creatively developed new markets for the jute goods, principally sacks, worldwide. In 1858 Indian financiers supported the importation of spinning machinery from Dundee in order to create their own industry. The Indian jute barons were able to pay workers less and gradually began to take over. Dundee had better access to European markets and the mills did not completely collapse until the 1960s.

It was produced for domestic consumption in the villages of present-day Bangladesh and West Bengal. Jute was used for rope production until the modern era, but the creation of the Jute Industry led to the collapse of Indian handloom jute in the 1880s. In the 1850s roughly ¬£250,000 of jute products were exported annually. Jute was an export material demanded by South East Asia which was fulfilled by Indian and European trading firms. The modern jute industry was not invented until 1833 in Dundee, but small quantities were used in flax and hemp spinning after 1790. By the early part of the twentieth century, there were huge increases of finished jute exports and a massive reduction in the export of raw jute. India was gaining around ¬£35 million per annum from processed goods, with only ¬£8m earned by sales of raw jute to Brazil, New York, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. Partition meant that 75% of the Jute growing areas were in Pakistan, but all 106 mills, the baling centres and export hubs were in India. Jute was the subject of the first inter-Dominion agreement, however, the devaluation of the Indian rupee and Pakistani demands for a share of the export tariff led to break downs.Sengupta, Anwepta.\\"Unthreading Partition The Politics of Jute Sharing between Two Bengals\\" Economic and Political Weekly 27 January 2018.

Jute mills continue to close, 8 in the last few years, down to 55. Migrant workers have left the state, wages have not increased and strikes have been commonplace.\\"Jute Industry in West Bengal Faces Crisis\\" Low Wages, Exploitation Leave Mill Workers Facing Uncertain Future\\" Jute traders =East India Company= The British East India Company was the British Empire Authority delegated in Bengal from the 17th century until dissolved in 1857. The Dutch and the French were the first jute traders. The company began exporting gunny sacks to South East Asiam during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. In the 1830s Thomas Neigh imported jute to Dundee and experimented using flax spinning machines to make cloth. This was not initially successful, but used as a small mixture with flax until they discovered that whale oil made it soft enough to be spun. Demand for jute skyrocketed as its uses in sacks, ropes, and cloth displaced flax. Between 1833 and 1855, Bengal saw a boom in growing jute, but a decline in its cottage hand spinning. In 1855 a George Auckland was financed by Bysamber Sen to import Dundee fabric spinning machinery (and whale oil) to start the first factory in India at Serampore. Although a failure, he inspired the Borneo Company to start a steam-powered weaving and spinning mill. Whereon a dozen companies began producing for domestic Indian use and export to the east. By 1908 Calcutta was the world's largest jute producer having defeated Dundee. From the 1890s the Marwaris had entered the market as brokers (like the Birla group) and became the dominant owners of an industry employing over 300,000 workers. =Bangladeshi jute traders= Being a major player in the long history of jute trade and having finest natural fibre, Bangladesh has always had an advantage in raw jute trading. Bangladesh is still the largest producer and exporter of raw jute in the world. After the separation of Bangladesh (East Pakistan) from Pakistan in 1971, the jute trading was not limited to specific groups like India or Pakistan. After the independence of Bangladesh, most privately owned jute mills were nationalised under the socialist policies of the Awami League government. Later, to control these jute mils in Bangladesh, the government built up Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC). No other jute mills were allowed to grow in the private sector before 1975. After Ziaur Rahman became Bangladesh president a new age dawned upon the Bangladesh jute industry. This incident grew many raw jute traders from different corners of Bangladesh who used to supply raw jute to BJMC owned jute mills. This group of traders are called Beparis, who buy raw jute directly from the farmers. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), a public corporation in Bangladesh, is the largest state owned manufacturing and exporting organisation in the world in the jute sector.BJMC official website BJMC owns and operates a number of jute mills around Bangladesh: *Dhaka Zone: Bengal Jute Industries Limited, Pride Jute Mills Ltd (established: 2003), Golden Jute Industries Ltd (established: 2012) Bangladesh Jute Mills, Karim Jute Mills, Latif Bawany Jute Mills, U.M.C Jute Mills, Janata Jute Mills, Qaumi Jute Mills, Rajshahi Jute Mills.

Dundee was a centre of flax spinning and the whale oil industry. They realised that jute could be mechanically spun if whale oil was added. They created a huge new industry making bags for the transport of goods like coffee and as sandbags.\\"3.1 Why jute? Why Dundee?\\" OpenLearn The Dundee jute industry started to decline when the machinery manufacturers sold the machinery to Indian merchants who benefitted from easier access to raw materials and lower pay.\\"The history of mills in Dundee\\" BBC website. 2 December 2009, Retrieved 15 May 2020 This is a famous example of free trade in which the liberal government was elected to not enact trade barriers allowing the Calcutta industry to win. Given that the \\"Dundee Jute Barons\\" had ownership stakes in Calcutta and Dundee, the decline in Scotland was not so burdensome on them. Over 50% of the workers in Dundee were in Jute and two-thirds were women, much of the remainder were children because they could be paid less. The boom had led to slums, over crowding, poor working conditions and low pay. =Post Independence India.= The Indian Jute Mills Association is the apex body controlling the Indian trade. Birla is the most famous business giant in India which began as a Jute broker. The Birla family is Marwari along with Mittal and Bajaj. Indian Jute is considered to be dominated by Marwari. The industry has faced considerable trouble, for example, a mill owner was murdered by his workers in 2015 when he proposed cutting down hours. 6 such murders have occurred in recent years. The Jute Industry in India depends on government purchase. Since the millennium government procurement for mandatory packaging in jute has decreased and is only now being reversed - at the consumer level ‚Äì by the plastic ban. =Pakistani Jute Traders Pre-1971= After liberation from the British, East Bengal with possessing the finest jute fibre stock, lacked an effective industrialised jute manufacturing.

The law specifies: Qualifying for this modification may require supporting documentation from the applicant's religious organization. The applicant is not required to belong to a specific religious group, but must have \\"a sincere and meaningful belief that has a place in the applicant's life that is equivalent to that of a religious belief.\\" =Waivers of the oath= The requirement to take and subscribe to the Oath of Allegiance of the United States is waived for children under 14 years of age at the time of naturalization. The requirement may also be waived for any person unable to understand or communicate an understanding of said Oath due to a physical disability or mental impairment. History During the Revolutionary War, oaths of allegiance were administered to officers of the Continental Army, pursuant to a Congressional resolution of February 3, 1778. An example appears below. The Oath of Allegiance for prospective citizens originated with the Naturalization Act of 1790, which required applicants to take an oath or affirmation \\"to support the constitution of the United States\\", but did not provide a text. The Naturalization Act of 1795 added renunciation of the new citizen's former sovereign to the oath. The Naturalization Act of 1906 added the section of the oath requiring new citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same. The Oath acquired a standard text in 1929. Prior to then, spoken oaths were adapted from naturalization law, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath. The Internal Security Act of 1950 added the text about bearing arms and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States. The section about performing work of national importance under civilian direction was added by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Changing the oath The current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the \\"five principles\\" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are: *allegiance to the United States Constitution, *renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances *defense of the Constitution against enemies \\"foreign and domestic\\" *promise to serve in the United States Armed Forces when required by law (either combat or non-combat) *promise to perform civilian duties of \\"national importance\\" when required by law There has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British Oath of Supremacy which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing. In the fall of 2003, CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for Citizenship Day (September 17).US Citizenship and Immigration Services Fact Sheet The proposed oath was as follows: The introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims on April 1, 2004. Incidents and controversies In United States v. Schwimmer (1929), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the denial of citizenship to an applicant who declared not to be willing to \\"take up arms personally\\" in defense of the United States. The applicant, Hungarian-born female suffragist Rosika Schwimmer, had written that she was an \\"uncompromising pacifist\\" with \\"no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family\\". The Court found that persons holding such views were \\"liable to be incapable of the attachment for and devotion to the principles of our Constitution\\" that are required for naturalization.United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644 (1929). English writer Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, applied for U.S. citizenship in 1953 after having lived in the United States for fourteen years. When asked if he would bear arms and perform noncombatant military service as required by the Oath, Huxley answered in the negative and was summoned before a judge. Huxley explained that his objection was based on philosophical convictions about the evil of war rather than religious beliefs. The judge adjourned proceedings and postponed a decision on Huxley's application in order to report to Washington. Huxley never received U.S. citizenship., p. 531-535, 545-546. In the 1968 case In re Weitzman, a U.S. district court considered the naturalization petition of Brenda Weitzman, a 25-year-old mother of two children from South Africa and religious non- believer who had refused to take the part of the Oath requiring her to serve in the Armed Forces. She expressed a total \\"objection to warfare and the bearing of arms\\" (conscientious objectorship), being \\"repulsed by no particular war, but by all killing.\\" The court, finding that her stance was \\"based on a personal moral code and not on religious training and belief\\" and that she did not recognize anything \\"tantamount to a God or a Supreme Being\\", denied her petition.In re Weitzman The precedent relied upon was United States v. Seeger (1965). However, in Welsh v. United States (1970), the Supreme Court, having noted the case factually similar and controlled by United States v. Seeger, determined in respect to the provision in the Universal Military Training and Service Act that exempts from military service persons who by reason of \\"religious training and belief\\" are conscientiously opposed to war, that the Act: This judgement was used in 2013 to reverse a denial of citizenship to Margaret Doughty, a 65 year old British atheist who had lived in the United States for 30 years, unless she could show proof of membership in a church with pacifist beliefs to support her claim that she was a conscientious objector entitled to omit the Oath's clause about bearing arms. The USCIS retracted their demand after receiving a letter from an atheist group that objected based on Welsh vs. United States.

After confirmation became the apprentice of the regiment surgeon, Mehl, a learned and skilled man, who gave his eager student a thorough introduction to both medicine and botany, thereby waking Schumacher's natural gift for science. By 1773, at the age of 16, his keen efforts got him appointed as a military surgeon with his father's battalion in the army stationed in Rendsburg, working under Dr. Mehl's command. In 1777 he got an 8-month leave from the army enroll as a student at Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum in Copenhagen (now a part of the faculty of medicine at the University of Copenhagen). While in Copenhagen he lived on nothing but an advance on his rather low wage and in 1778 he returned starved to his post in Rendsburg. He had however made a good enough impression on professor Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll for him to call Schumacher back to Copenhagen to finish the education and to a position as prosector at the University of Copenhagen. =Choice of profession (1778-1789)= This was his opportunity to begin a scientific career. He graduated from Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum no later than 1779, and begun studying botany under the guidance of both Rottb√∏ll and Martin Vahl, who had recently become lecturer at the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden. Intending to follow Vahl's example Schumacher embarked upon what was intended to be an international research tour in 1784, but the timetable of the ship was changed at the last minute and he got no further than the Baltic Sea. This forced him to change his plans altogether and returning to Copenhagen he became a surgeon at both Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum and at Frederiks Hospital. In 1786 he took the exam of the recently started surgical academy and a position as lecturer at the academy. Later that year he received a scholarship and finally embarked on a study trip around Europe from 1786 to 1789. In Paris he studied chemistry in the lectures of Antoine Lavoisier and Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy and botany with Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. And in London he was influenced by John Hunter among others. It had been a condition of the scholarship that he would study chemistry.

Several fundamental theological beliefs distinguish the Ayyavazhi tradition from Hinduism. Relations between Vaikundar Ekam and other lesser Gods  Ayyavazhi believes in one God (Bhagavan Vishnu), but recognizes that the one God Vishnu can appear to humans in a multiplicity of names and forms (avataras). The first half of Akilam asserts the existence and power-status of different god-heads and in the second half after the incarnation of Vaikundar though they have a secondary place, they do exist. Especially, though all powers were surrendered to Vaikundar, Narayana acts a double role throughout the incarnation of Vaikundar, as the Father of Vaikundar. So Akilam accepts that all god-heads exist. But Vaikundar is the only powerful and supreme, which channels Ayyavazhi theology towards Henotheism. But God is, in the highest sense, one: formless (no material form, only spiritual/transcendental), infinite, and eternal. God is changeless and is the source of consciousness (jiva-atmas) as well as the supreme consciousness (Paramatma) itself. God is beyond time, space, and causation yet still exists within everything and every being. Being formless, God is genderless (Vishnu is male, but can accept female form of Mohini). The name Ekam is mentioned quite often in Ayyavazhi scriptures. But beyond the mere mention of the 'term' several times, no longer description is provided for the word (Ekam is similar to Ek-Omkar (One AUM) of Sikhism). The term Ekam in Tamil gives simply the meaning, \\"one and the incomparable supreme\\". This is some sort of monistic definition about god from Ayyavazhi theology. There are a series of lesser god-heads mentioned in Akilam with minor powers. Vaikundar is viewed on one hand as the incarnation of Ekam and on the other hand as being equal in powers to him. But during the encounter of Vaikundar with the King of Travancore, a verse of Akilam states that Ekam itself was created by Vaikundar. So Vaikundar would be superior to all. Regarding Vaikundar, Ekam remains one among the three in the Trinity in Vaikundar during the incarnation. So all qualities of Ekam (changeless attributes etc...) fits also to Vaikundar. Strengthening this view a series of quotes from Arul Nool portraits Vaikundar as eternal and reveals his Universal form. =Mythical Narration= Evolution of Ekam, through the ages(yugas) The mythical narrative speaks of Sivam (matter) and Shakti (energy) as the next evolved powers from the supreme Ekam. Then the Three lesser God-heads (i.e., Trimurthi) which are Sivan, Vethan and Thirumal evolved from this Shakthi. It also speaks of several further evolved lesser Gods. But in Kali Yukam, due to the cruel nature of the boons offered to Kaliyan, Thirumal (the then supreme power) cannot destroy the sixth fragment of Kroni directly so all God-heads were unified into the Ekam, and Ekam Incarnated in the world as a Turine god (Ekam, Narayana and Human) in the form of Vaikundar to overcome the boons and to destroy Kali. Since all were unified in Vaikundar, in Kali Yukam Vaikundar he was the Supreme Power and he was the only worshippable God. So in this regard Ayyavazhi is also viewed as a monotheistic religion.Akilam 9:667-670 (Narayana call Vaikundar \\"You are my son who was adored by all mystics\\" Akilattirattu Ammanai also speaks of Dharma Yukam in which Vaikundar rules like a king. There Vaikundar will be the undisputed power ruling the fourteen worlds. No such a (i.e.) a single God to rule the fourteen worlds exists. Also no such throne to rule the fourteen worlds exists. But immediately after the incarnation of Vaikundar, Narayana told Vaikundar in the Muttappathi Vinchai that the incomparable throne is growing for him. The mythical narration of Ayyavazhi shows Vaikundar as a supreme power.  Dualistic dimension  The Kroni, the primordial manifestation of evil, was fragmented into six. Each was destroyed in successive Yugas; finally, Kaliyan (the last) will be sentenced to hell after the final judgement which led to the consideration of Ayyavazhi towards dualism. Kaliyan is called an evil spirit which came to the world. So it was commonly accepted that the destruction of the maya (evil spirit) was symbolised in such a way.Arisundara Mani's Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 1, Page -36, \\"Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance.\\" But the scripture is most commonly concerned with Ultimate Oneness right from the beginning to the end. So the dualistic views were contrasted by the monistic narration. Also the contents of Arul Nool, based on the teachings of Vaikundar, which were believed to be written by arulalarkal and Citars, is completely monistic.  Pantheism and panentheism  The evolution of Ekam till Dwapara Yuga Though Ayyavazhi is mostly connected with the concept of Ekam, some followers advocate Ayyavazhi as Pantheistic, sticking to the concept of Ekan (one who appears as oneness or Ekam in Tamil) which was used to refer as God in Akilam seven. In this expression, the Akilam lays the groundwork for viewing Ayyavazhi as a pantheistic faith. In a quote in Kappu, the very first part of Akilam one, the author of Akilam says, \\"By keeping us inside yourself, please help us\\".Akilam1:12. Regarding Panentheism, there are many quotes in Akilam to suggest it, but there are more that reveal Ayyavazhi as monistic. For example, during the Vinchai, inside the sea, Narayana, seeing Vaikundar, says that \\"You are Sivan, you are Thirumal, you are Nathan, you are the Tapas, and you are the one who is omnipresent in all which exists\\". And when Vaikundar is jailed in Thiruvananthapuram he alleviates the Santror by saying \\"I am the one who created the Ekam and the one who is omnipresent.\\" -- (Akilam 13:395).  Narayana in Ayyavazhi  Lord Narayana has the most important role in Ayyavazhi theology compared to any other God-heads from Hindu tradition. The internal evidence states that the primary scripture of Ayyavazhi, Akilattirattu Ammanai was told by Narayan to his consort Lakshmi, which was heard by Hari Gopalan Citar. =Narayana and Siva Relation= The importance of Narayana in the theology of Ayyavazhi varies through the ages. Before the creation, though the three god-heads, Siva, Brahma and Vishnu are all treated with equal status Siva is the supreme or over-all power. All the powers came from Siva and the final words for all sort of functioning - creation, maintaining and Destroying all will be from Siva and that will be done by others. This view on Siva is similar to Saivism. After six yugas, during the creation of Kaliyan in the seventh Kali Yuga, Siva hearing the words of Devas without discussing with Vishnu, created Kaliyan though they have a deed that, all asuras should be created after discussing with each of the Trimurti. Due to this action of Siva, Vishnu refused to incarnate in the world for destroying the final fragment of Kroni. So Siva, Brahma and all other devas surrendered all their powers to Narayana. So from here onwards all others were puppet-reign and Narayana is the supreme universal power. This view is similar to that of Vaisnavism on Vishnu. =Vaikundar and Narayana - Relation= Several episodes, as narrated in the Akilam (the holy text of Ayyavazhi), describe Ayya Vaikundar as an Avatar of Vishnu (a Tamil name for Vishnu). All these episodes -- starting with his 'birth' at sea as the 'son' of Narayana, the performance of the grand Tavam, the symbolic shamanic actions of incinerating the demons, the seizing of esoteric powers, and the unifying of the deities unto himself -- highlight the important message that Ayya Vaikundar came as the avatar of Narayana. The followers of Ayyavazhi believe and worship him as a deity, the incarnation of Narayana. (see: Ayyavazhi Trinity) Vaikundar as Narayana After the birth in the sea, Vaikundar was addressed by Akilam quite commonly as Narayana. In most of the teachings of Vaikundar to the people, he portraits himself as incarnation of Narayana. The theological definition from Akilam about Vaikundar too focuses mostly on the same point. The incarnation of Vaikundar in the world is to destroy Kali and it was the duty of Narayana to do this. So in that sense the view is strengthened that Vaikundar is Narayana himself. Then the aim of the austrity of seven virgins towards vishnu to marry them is fulfilled in the Vaikunda Avatharam by Vaikundar. Vaikundar as son of Narayana Right from the beginning of the incarnation of Vaikundar in the sea, Vaikundar calls Narayana as Father, through the vinchais. The episode comes in a way that the whole details, powers, instructions, and laws were given to Vaikundar by Narayana. Then after Vaikundar comes out of the sea, he is called as Narayana by devas. Summing up, the Father - son relationship between Narayana and Vaikundar is highlighted during the three vinchai.  Ayya Vaikundar as the supreme deity  In Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikundar is considered the supreme deity and an incarnation of Mayon. Due to this belief, the followers of Ayyavazhi seem to have taken him to be the centre of all divinities. He was the incarnation, not only of Thirumal, but also of Sivan and Brahma as well. In order to demonstrate that he was the supreme deity of the present age, Ayya Vaikundar not only performed symbolic marriages in which all surrounding popular deities were surrendered and unified unto himself, he also did away with refractory evil spirits. (see:Ayyavazhi Trinity) Right from the beginning of the Vinchai of Tiruchendur Vaikundar has been focused as the ultimate power or incarnation of the supreme Ekam. All sort of administrations - Creating maintaining and destroying were all handled to Vaikundar through the Vinchai by Narayana, who was responsible for all these actions from the beginning of Kali Yuga. Narayan also says about all different divine powers and deities of the world and assure that, \\"During the avatar, all such divine powers, deities and attributes will be surrendered and will be unifyied into you\\". =Ekam - Narayana - Vaikundar= The relations between the Ekam, Narayana and Vaikundar were understood as having different implications found in several verses of Ayyavazhi scriptures. Thiru Nadana Ula, the section which describes the situational changes that are going to happen in the world from the advent of Vaikundar, say the relation between these three power-heads as, the 'Ekam is taken inside Narayana and with that power Vaikundar is being given birth' which means, Ekam is regenerated as Vaikundar in Kali Yuga by Narayana concluding that Narayana is the Father of the Supreme Vaikundar. =Vaikundar revealing his Supremacy= Vaikundar, by his various incarnational activities reveals him as the supreme power apart from the relationship of Narayana. After the incarnation Vaikundar at the sea-shore of Tiruchendur provided Rules and regulations to God-heads. During this the supremacy of Vaikundar is revealed by the event of Vaikundar ordering all devas of the cosmos the do's and don'ts which are to be followed. Even here Vaikundar was stated as the incarnation of Ekam. Another area in which Vaikundar has been high lightened as the supreme universal power is the Marriage with the deities. During this, Vaikundar unifyied into him all the deities. He unifyied into him Parvati in the form of Siva, unifyied Lakshmi in the form of Vishnu, Sarasvati in the form of Brahma, Valli and Deyvanai as Muruga etc., showing that Vaikundar is the incarnation of the supreme power, from which all these lower divine powers are generated. Then at the end during the Dharma Yuga, Vaikundar is placed in the Throne of the Fourteen worlds. Before Vaikundar, there was no single god- head who ruled the whole fourteen worlds. This episode shows the supremacy of Vaikundar. See also *List of Ayyavazhi-related articles References Sources * G.

Mason's 2003 arrest and prosecution for the 1957 murders of two El Segundo, California police officers made national headlines. Criminal career Born in Columbia, South Carolina, he was arrested and did time for burglary in that state in 1956. After his release in 1957, then aged 23, he hitchhiked his way to California, stopping in Shreveport, Louisiana where he purchased a revolver using an alias. He later stated that it was purchased for protection while hitchhiking. In Hawthorne, California, Mason came upon four teenagers at a local lover's lane. Drawing his revolver, Mason forced the two couples to strip down to their underwear and bound and blindfolded them. He then raped one of the girls. Leaving the teens alive as they were, Mason then drove off in their 1949 Ford sedan, ran a red light, and was pulled over by Officers Richard Phillips and Milton Curtis of the El Segundo Police Department. Mason later recalled, \\"I thought, 'If I don't get them, they're gonna get me.' So when the officer turned away from me, I shot both officers, got back in the car and drove away.\\" Backup units and medical personnel arrived on scene to find Curtis dead in his patrol car, with Phillips lying mortally wounded on the ground. Both had been shot three times. Meanwhile, Mason, who had been wounded by a bullet from Officer Phillips, dumped the car and fled through numerous backyards before hitchhiking his way to safety. Investigation The murders of Officers Phillips and Curtis touched off a homicide investigation that continued for almost half a century. In 1960, the murder weapon was recovered a mile from the crime in a back yard. The serial number was traced to a purchase at Sears in Shreveport, Louisiana, under the alias George D. Wilson. The signature was matched to \\"Wilson's\\" signature on a YMCA receipt, located near the Sears store. El Segundo detectives proceeded to track down every George D. Wilson in the United States. However all were ruled out, and the investigation went cold. For the next 45 years, Mason was a law-abiding citizen, never getting so much as a parking ticket. He owned two service stations, had married and raised a family. He was later described by friends and neighbors as friendly and helpful. In 2002, with advances in computerized finger-printing technology, the FBI decided to expand the system to include prints collected during arrests in all 50 states. A match based on the partial left thumb prints lifted from the steering wheel of the stolen car, came back about a man convicted of burglary in 1956 in Columbia. He had served time for that case. Besides the matching fingerprint the evidence was also based on matching handwriting, thus linking him to the murder weapon. Police located Mason, who had returned to and was still living in his hometown of Columbia, South Carolina. He was a wealthy retiree and a grandfather, quietly living with his family in a suburban neighborhood. Then in January 2003, a large group of police officers called at his door. Mason was completely shocked and had asked where they were from. The police officers had said, \\"We are from the El Segundo Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\\" Mason then said, \\"You're homicide detectives? I think I need a lawyer.\\" The police officers then told him that they were there because of the murders of two police officers in 1957. Horrified, Mason responded, \\"My god, you're here for that reason?\\" Following his arrest, Mason was further identified by the bullet graze wound scar on his back, from a bullet fired by Officer Phillips in 1957. Confronted with so much evidence, Mason admitted to detectives that he stumbled upon the teenagers while intoxicated. Afterwards, he shot both police officers in an attempt to cover up the rape, robbery, and theft of the car. Mason further told detectives, \\"I really don't have an explanation for why this happened. I wish I did.\\" When asked why he had raped a 15-year-old girl, Mason responded that he no longer remembered. Sentencing Mason pleaded guilty to the murders and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, with a minimum of 7 years. As part of the deal, the rape, robbery and grand theft charges were dropped. At his sentencing hearing, Mason tearfully apologized to the families of Officers Phillips and Curtis. He said, \\"It's impossible to express to so many people how sorry I am. I do not understand why I did this. It does not fit in my life. It is not the person I know. I detest these crimes.\\" One El Segundo detective commented, \\"He was remorseful. But I think he was more sad and more sorry for having been caught.\\" Mason, 75, was turned down for parole in 2009. The three-member board decided Mason should not come before the panel again for the maximum period of 15 years until March 2024 when he would have been 90 years old. California prosecutors were determined that he would never be released. He was incarcerated in South Carolina, as his plea bargain granted him approval to serve his prison sentence near his family. The widow of Officer Curtis commented, \\"I'm not his victim any more. My son is not his victim any more. I'm so grateful, and I had to wait this long. It's worth the wait.\\" In a 2003 interview with People Magazine, Jerri Mason Whittaker, Gerald Mason's daughter, said, \\"There really aren't words to describe the range of emotions we've gone through.\\" Even so, she insisted, \\"I could not have had a better father.\\" This story was shown on episodes of \\"Cold Case Files,\\" Forensic Files, 48 Hours Mystery and Murder Book. Death Mason passed away in prison on January 22, 2017, 9 days before his 83rd birthday.Why We Wear the Stars - City of El Segundo He spent 14 years in prison. His next parole hearing was still 7 years away. References Sources *\\"The Ghosts Of El Segundo: Cold-Blooded Crime Haunts Investigators For Half A Century\\", CBS News, October 2, 2004.

Description Female at Taronga Zoo, Australia It is sexually dimorphic. Males are superbly coloured with a fiery orange nape, green ears, and a purple crown. The breast is grey, and divided from the abdomen by a wide, dark blue band. Their wings are olive green covered with dark spots, and the tail is tipped with white. Females are mostly green, with a white abdomen, blue wing tips, light blue breast, and a small, dark blue spot on the back of the head. Both sexes have yellow eyes and eye-rings. Despite its colourful plumage, the superb fruit dove is well-camouflaged amongst the rainforest foliage. Range Male at Burgers' Zoo, Netherlands Native to Australasia, the superb fruit dove lives in the rainforests of New Guinea, Australia, Solomon Islands, the Philippines and Sulawesi of Indonesia. In Australia, it is found from southern New South Wales around the town of Moruya and extends further north, where it becomes more common to Cape York in Queensland. In some areas of its range, such as the New Guinean rainforest, it is a resident bird; in more marginal or seasonal habitats such as those in Australia, flocks are known to move about according to the availability of food (Frith et al. 1976). Diet The superb fruit dove feeds primarily upon fruits and berries. In the Port Moresby area, the bulk of its diet was found to consist of figs, notably Ficus albipila and Ficus benjamina, Canarium australianum drupes, and Archontophoenix, Calamus and Livistona palm fruit. Also frequently eaten were the fruits of various cinnamon trees, Litsea, Neolitsea and Cryptocarya. Less important food were fruits of Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata), Syzygium, and Vitex cofassus. They eat smaller fruit than some other fruit doves; the maximum recorded volume was 2.5 cm¬≥; in a spherical fruit, a 1.7 cm diameter.Frith, H.J.; Crome, F.H.J.C.; Wolfe, T.O. (1976). Food of Fruit- Pigeons in New Guinea. Emu 76(2): 49-58. HTML abstract Behaviour Superb fruit doves' wings whistle when they fly, and their call is a steady coo-coo- coo-coo. The breeding season lasts from September to January. A small platform of twigs is built 5‚Äì30 metres off the ground, in which the female lays one small, white egg. She incubates it during the night. The male takes his turn during the day. Conservation Habitat loss is a primary threat, but the superb fruit dove is still fairly widespread and common throughout its large range. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ranks it as least concern. In New South Wales, however, the superb fruit dove is considered vulnerable, meaning it is likely to become endangered.New South Wales Threatened Species. (2005). Superb Fruit Dove.

A jet is a narrow cone of hadrons and other particles produced by the hadronization of a quark or gluon in a particle physics or heavy ion experiment. Particles carrying a color charge, such as quarks, cannot exist in free form because of QCD confinement which only allows for colorless states. When an object containing color charge fragments, each fragment carries away some of the color charge. In order to obey confinement, these fragments create other colored objects around them to form colorless objects. The ensemble of these objects is called a jet, since the fragments all tend to travel in the same direction, forming a narrow \\"jet\\" of particles. Jets are measured in particle detectors and studied in order to determine the properties of the original quarks. A jet definition includes a jet algorithm and a recombination scheme. The former defines how some inputs, e.g. particles or detector objects, are grouped into jets, while the latter specifies how a momentum is assigned to a jet. In particle physics experiments, jets are usually built from clusters of energy depositions in the detector calorimeter. When studying simulated processes, the calorimeter jets can be reconstructed based on a simulated detector response. However, in simulated samples, jets can also be reconstructed directly from stable particles emerging from fragmentation processes. Particle-level jets are often referred to as truth-jets. A good jet algorithm usually allows for obtaining similar sets of jets at different levels in the event evolution. Typical jet reconstruction algorithms are, e.g., the anti-kT algorithm, kT algorithm, cone algorithm. A typical recombination scheme is the E-scheme, or 4-vector scheme, in which the 4-vector of a jet is defined as the sum of 4-vectors of all its constituents. In relativistic heavy ion physics, jets are important because the originating hard scattering is a natural probe for the QCD matter created in the collision, and indicate its phase. When the QCD matter undergoes a phase crossover into quark gluon plasma, the energy loss in the medium grows significantly, effectively quenching (reducing the intensity of) the outgoing jet. Example of jet analysis techniques are: * jet correlation * flavor tagging (e.g., b-tagging) * jet substructure. The Lund string model is an example of a jet fragmentation model. Jet production Jets are produced in QCD hard scattering processes, creating high transverse momentum quarks or gluons, or collectively called partons in the partonic picture. The probability of creating a certain set of jets is described by the jet production cross section, which is an average of elementary perturbative QCD quark, antiquark, and gluon processes, weighted by the parton distribution functions. For the most frequent jet pair production process, the two particle scattering, the jet production cross section in a hadronic collision is given by \\\\sigma_{ij \\\\rightarrow k} = \\\\sum_{i, j} \\\\int d x_1 d x_2 d\\\\hat{t} f_i^1(x_1, Q^2) f_j^2(x_2, Q^2) \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_{ij \\\\rightarrow k}}{d\\\\hat{t}}, with * x, Q2: longitudinal momentum fraction and momentum transfer * \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_{ij \\\\rightarrow k}: perturbative QCD cross section for the reaction ij ‚Üí k * f_i^a(x, Q^2): parton distribution function for finding particle species i in beam a. Elementary cross sections \\\\hat{\\\\sigma} are e.g. calculated to the leading order of perturbation theory in Peskin & Schroeder (1995), section 17.4. A review of various parameterizations of parton distribution functions and the calculation in the context of Monte Carlo event generators is discussed in T. Sj√∂strand et al. (2003), section 7.4.1. Jet fragmentation Perturbative QCD calculations may have colored partons in the final state, but only the colorless hadrons that are ultimately produced are observed experimentally. Thus, to describe what is observed in a detector as a result of a given process, all outgoing colored partons must first undergo parton showering and then combination of the produced partons into hadrons. The terms fragmentation and hadronization are often used interchangeably in the literature to describe soft QCD radiation, formation of hadrons, or both processes together. As the parton which was produced in a hard scatter exits the interaction, the strong coupling constant will increase with its separation. This increases the probability for QCD radiation, which is predominantly shallow-angled with respect to the originating parton. Thus, one parton will radiate gluons, which will in turn radiate pairs and so on, with each new parton nearly collinear with its parent. This can be described by convolving the spinors with fragmentation functions P_{ji}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{z}, Q^2\\\\right), in a similar manner to the evolution of parton density functions. This is described by a Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov- Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) type equation \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\ln Q^2} D_{i}^{h}(x, Q^2) = \\\\sum_{j} \\\\int_{x}^{1} \\\\frac{dz}{z} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_S}{4\\\\pi} P_{ji}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{z}, Q^2\\\\right) D_{j}^{h}(z, Q^2) Parton showering produces partons of successively lower energy, and must therefore exit the region of validity for perturbative QCD. Phenomenological models must then be applied to describe the length of time when showering occurs, and then the combination of colored partons into bound states of colorless hadrons, which is inherently not-perturbative. One example is the Lund String Model, which is implemented in many modern event generators.  Infrared and collinear safety  A jet algorithm is infrared safe if it yields the same set of jets after modifying an event to add a soft radiation. Similarly, a jet algorithm is collinear safe if the final set of jets is not changed after introducing a collinear splitting of one of the inputs. There are several reasons why a jet algorithm must fulfill these two requirements. Experimentally, jets are useful if they carry information about the seed parton. When produced, the seed parton is expected to undergo a parton shower, which may include a series of nearly-collinear splittings before the hadronization starts. Furthermore, the jet algorithm must be robust when it comes to fluctuations in the detector response. Theoretically, If a jet algorithm is not infrared and collinear safe, it can not be guaranteed that a finite cross-section can be obtained at any order of perturbation theory.

He was a friend of Charles Dickens and many other literary and artistic figures. Life and work Warwick Castle (1834 engraving by J C Bentley after Cattermole) He was born at Dickleburgh, near Diss, Norfolk. At the age of fourteen he began working as an architectural and topographical draughtsman for the antiquary John Britton. Afterwards he contributed designs to be engraved in the annuals then so popular, then progressed into watercolour painting, becoming an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1822, and a full member in 1833. In 1850 he withdrew from active connection with this society, and took to painting in oil. His most fertile period was between 1833 and 1850. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received one of the five first-class gold medals awarded to British painters. He also enjoyed professional honors in Amsterdam and in Belgium. Among his leading works are The Murder of the Bishop of Liege, The Armourer relating the Story of the Sword, The Assassination of the Regent Murray by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, and (in oil) A Terrible Secret. He was largely employed by publishers, illustrating the Cathedral Antiquities of England produced by John Britton, the Waverley Novels, and the Historical Annual of his brother Richard Cattermole (his scenes from the wars of Cavaliers and Roundheads in this series are among his best engraved works), and many other volumes besides. He collaborated on illustrations for Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge. Cattermole specialized in rendering scenes of chivalry, of medievalism, and generally of the romantic aspects of the past. Cattermole is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, near the tomb of his first employer John Britton. References Further reading *Cohen, Jane R.

Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be manual or motor operated. Unlike load switches and circuit breakers, disconnectors lack a mechanism for suppression of electric arcs, which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically interrupted. Thus, they are under-load (discharging the high voltage) or off-load devices, with very low breaking capacity, intended to be opened only after current has been interrupted by some other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked). Disconnectors have provisions for a lockout-tagout so that inadvertent operation is not possible. In high-voltage or complex systems, these locks may be part of a trapped-key interlock system to ensure proper sequence of operation. In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to earth the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter- connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated. A switch disconnector combines the properties of the disconnector and the load switch, so it provides the safety isolation function while being able to make and break nominal currents.  Types of disconnectors  Disconnectors can be classified into various types based upon their constructional features and mounting arrangement. The major types of disconnectors are: * Centre-break disconnectors * Double-break disconnectors * Pantograph disconnectors * Horizontal break knee disconnectors Umspannwerk- Hoheneck_Scheren-Trennschalter.jpgPantograph disconnectors for 220kV. Yellow painting allows recognition of their state. These are selected based upon the sub-station layout, clearances available and space constrains. Integrated disconnecting switch In a disconnecting circuit breaker the disconnectors are integrated in the breaking chamber, which eliminates the need for separate disconnectors. The intention of this combined device is to decrease maintenance and increase availability and reliability. The usage of this device instead of a disconnector is limited due to the fact that the open gap is not clearly visible and many doubts in term of safety arise during maintenance activities. Where it is adopted the earthing switch must be used and the performance must be increased by the typical value. The open-air disconnecting switches typically need maintenance every five years (every two years under very polluted conditions), while circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Nieve has been a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions, the Imposters and Madness. He has also experienced success as a prolific session musician, featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Early years Nieve was born in London, England, and attended the Royal College of Music, but dropped out in 1977 to join Costello's backing band the Attractions. Nason received his musical moniker \\"Nieve\\" (pronounced \\"na√Øve\\") while on the Attractions' first tour for Stiff Records. It was bestowed by tourmate Ian Dury who had been astonished by Nason's innocent query, \\"What's a groupie?\\" Before that, at least briefly, he had been using the stage name \\"Steve A'dore\\" (a pun on stevedore). Career Nieve played piano, organ and other keyboard instruments on most of Costello's projects over the next ten years, including the albums This Year's Model (1978), Imperial Bedroom (1982) and Blood & Chocolate (1986). On the 1984 Costello album Goodbye Cruel World and its accompanying tour, he was credited as \\"Maurice Worm.\\" His instrument credit on the album was not for playing keyboards, but for providing \\"random racket\\". He wrote some material on The Attractions' Costello-less album, Mad About the Wrong Boy under the name Norman Brain, in collaboration with his then girlfriend, Fay Hart. (He also wrote other songs on the album as Steve Nieve.) In the mid-1980s, Costello began to work less frequently with the Attractions and stopped working with them entirely between 1987 and 1993. During this period, Nieve focused on session work for other artists (the Neville Brothers, Hothouse Flowers, Graham Parker, Squeeze, Tim Finn, Kirsty MacColl, Madness, Nick Heyward and David Bowie). Also in 1986, Nieve formed the group the Perils of Plastic with ex- Deaf School vocalist Steve Allen, releasing three non-charting singles in the UK in 1986 and 1987. Around the same time, he led the house band (billed as Steve Nieve and The Playboys) on the UK TV series The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross. Costello reunited the Attractions for 1994's album Brutal Youth. Although the reunion was relatively short-lived (they split again in 1996), the Costello/Nieve collaborations never stopped. They have toured as a duo, and Nieve has contributed keyboards to all of Costello's albums since the mid-1990s, including 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted From Memory, 2001's Anne Sofie von Otter collaboration For the Stars and 2003's North. In 2001 Costello formed a new backing band consisting of Nieve, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas, and bassist Davey Faragher. The band was subsequently dubbed the Imposters. Elvis Costello & the Imposters have toured extensively and released the albums When I Was Cruel (2002), Cruel Smile (2003), The Delivery Man (2004), The River in Reverse (2006) with Allen Toussaint and Momofuku (2008), National Ransom (2010), Look Now (2018). In 2020 Nieve won a Grammy for his work with Elvis Costello and the Imposters on Look Now. Solo career In addition to his work with Costello, Nieve has released several solo albums. Keyboard Jungle (1983) was his first, a combination of classical and ersatz film scores delivered from his beloved Steinway piano. His second album, Playboy (1987), consisted of solo acoustic piano renditions of rock songs by David Bowie, 10cc, the Specials, X and others, as well as original compositions. Though both albums were released only in the UK by the independent label Demon Music Group, they were critically well received and noted for their \\"display [of] the artist's wit, compositional talent and abundant instrumental agility.\\" Nieve followed these with the albums It's Raining Somewhere (1996), Mumu (2001) and Windows (2004). His classical opera, Welcome to the Voice, a collaboration with Muriel T√©odori, was released on Deutsche Grammophon in May 2007. The score was interpreted by Barbara Bonney, Sting, Robert Wyatt, Elvis Costello, Amanda Roocroft, Nathalie Manfrino and Sara Fulgoni for the voices. For the music the Brodsky Quartet interpreted a written score, while Marc Ribot, Ned Rothenberg and Nieve improvised. Nieve also composed the score to T√©odori's film Sans Plomb. In 2008 Welcome to the Voice was premiered at the Theatre du Ch√¢telet Paris with Sting, Elvis Costello, and Sylvia Schwartz in the role of Lily. In 2014, he released ToGetHer.

A recipient of the U.S. Water Prize and many other awards, the District has a record of 98.5%, since 1994, for capturing and cleaning wastewater from 28 communities in a area. The national goal is 85% of all the rain and wastewater that enters their sewer systems. With headquarters and a central laboratory along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee, it has two wastewater treatment plants which are located at Jones Island () in Milwaukee and at the South Shore () in Oak Creek. These facilities were operated by United Water under a 10-year agreement ending March 1, 2008. Veolia Water is the current operator. \\"The world‚Äôs first large scale wastewater treatment plant was constructed on Jones Island, near the shore of Lake Michigan.\\" The primary wastewater treatment plant at Jones Island was one of the first of its kind when the original activated sludge plant was constructed in 1925. MMSD was the first to market biosolids created through this process as a fertilizer under the name \\"Milorganite.\\" The Jones Island Plant was among the first sewage treatment plants in the United States to succeed in using the activated sludge treatment process. \\"It was the first treatment facility to economically dispose of the recovered sludge by producing an organic fertilizer.\\" In the early 1980s the plant needed extensive reworking, \\"this does not detract from its historic significance as a pioneering facility in the field of pollution control technology.\\" It had the largest capacity of any plant in the world when constructed. The 1925 plant has been designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. MMSD has maintained an inline storage system (ISS) based on tunnels to store and convey wet weather flows, including combined sewage, since 1994. The ISS tunnels have a total capacity of 400 MG and a combined length of over 20 miles. Since 1994, the ISS tunnels have prevented more than 37 BG of CSOs and SSOs from entering area waterways, including Lake Michigan. Between 1994 and 2000, CSOs decreased from 40-60 events per year to an average of 2.5 events per year (WDNR 2001).  MMSD Initiatives  = Flood Management = Flooding and erosion of the watersheds in the greater Milwaukee area threaten public health and private property. Watersheds boundaries do not necessarily follow municipal boundaries, reducing the risk of flooding requires looking at the watershed as a whole, including the complete river system and its tributaries. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has discretionary authority to maintain the watersheds in the Greater Milwaukee Area and authority to reduce the risk of flooding is in Wis. Stats., sec. 200.31(1). In the past, work has included: rehabilitation and removal of concrete, removal of sediment and flow-impeding objects, and widening floodplains for flood management purposes. = Fresh Coat Guardians Resource Center - Green Infrastructure = The Fresh Coast Resource Center (FCRC) helps southeastern Wisconsin improve the health of Lake Michigan through smart use of green infrastructure. The FCRC assists the community by providing the inspiration, education, and tools needed to create successful green infrastructure projects. In 2017, MMSD opened the FCRC to empower people, homeowners, businesses, nonprofits, and government to take an active role in protecting our most precious natural resource: water. By helping the community to protect our rivers and Lake Michigan, we work to achieve our goal of capturing the first 0.5 inch of rainfall in our service area. By capturing the first 0.5 inch of rain, 740 million gallons of water will stay out of our sewers, helping to prevent sewer overflows and reducing runoff pollution. Combined Sewer Overflows Diverting combined sewer overflows to waterways is an emergency measure to prevent sewage backups into basements when wastewater treatment facilities reach capacity. MMSD follows the 2014 State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Discharge Permit for sewer overflows. Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. When a CSO happens,they post it on their website and have 5 days to report it to the DNR. According to scientists at the UW-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, bacteria from CSO's only survive for up to 10 days due to the frigid temperatures of Lake Michigan. Combined sewer overflows are 90 to 95% stormwater and groundwater. MMSD's combined sewer overflows are smaller than those of other cities on the Great Lakes, including Cleveland's and Detroit's, and are similar to that of the smaller city of Grand Rapids. Year- to-year combined sewer overflows vary depending on local rainfall but as a recent example in 2014 MMSD combined sewer overflows totaled 342 million gallons, meaning that 99.5% of the total flow through the municipal sewer system was treated. MMSD‚Äôs permit requires that Controlled Sewer Overflows be limited to no more than six overflows per year, consistent with the presumption approach in the CSO Control Policy. Separating the sanitary and storm sewers would decrease the amount of water captured and treated, however the amount of pollutants going into our rivers and Lake Michigan would increase. In urban areas with many impervious surfaces (buildings, parking lots, streets), there is little opportunity for stormwater to be absorbed into green areas. Resulting in run off with a high degree of pollutants that would further erode water quality. = Deep Tunnel = \\"Since 1994, a more than 26-mile- (42-kilometer-) long tunnel has been keeping Milwaukee's sewage from spilling into Lake Michigan. This deep water tunnel‚Äîa holding tank on steroids‚Äîcomprises two legs roughly 300 feet (90 meters) belowground that can hold nearly 500 million gallons (1.9 billion liters) of sewage and storm water during a downpour. And for the last 14 years it has kept 74 billion gallons (280 billion liters) of wastewater out of Lake Michigan, according to Bill Graffin, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.\\" - David Biello, Scientific American. The Deep Tunnel has prevented more than 125 billion gallons of pollution from getting into Lake Michigan. Thanks to the tunnel and many other improvements, MMSD has captured and cleaned 98.4% of all the stormwater and wastewater that's entered the regional sewer system since 1994. The goal nationally is to capture and clean 85% for the more than 700 cities with systems like ours.

KPNLF camps shown in black. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF, ) was a political front organized in 1979 in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) regime in Cambodia. The 200,000 Vietnamese troops supporting the PRK, as well as Khmer Rouge defectors, had ousted the brutal Democratic Kampuchea regime of Pol Pot, and were initially welcomed by the majority of Cambodians as liberators. Some Khmer, though, recalled the two countries' historical rivalry and feared that the Vietnamese would attempt to subjugate the country, and began to oppose their military presence. Members of the KPNLF supported this view. Origins On 5 January 1979 a \\"Committee for a Neutral and Independent Cambodia\\" (Comit√© pour un Cambodge Neutre et Ind√©pendant, CCNI) was established in Paris composed of Son Sann (a leading Cambodian neutralist, ex- President of the National Bank of Cambodia, and Prime Minister from 1967 to 1968), Sim Var, Yem Sambaur, Hhiek Tioulong, Nong Kimmy, Thonn Ouk and Chai Thoul. It issued a six-point declaration condemning the Khmer Rouge and the \\"North Vietnamese Aggression\\", urged adherence to the 1954 Geneva Accords and 1973 Paris Peace Conference proposals, demanded an immediate ceasefire in Cambodia, and the establishment of a democratically elected government to be established following a referendum.Corfield J. J., \\"A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983.\\" Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 9.Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, . Vietnam had invaded Democratic Kampuchea in December 1978 and entered Phnom Penh on January 6, 1979. Immediately the Royal Thai Government approached Son Sann with offers of support for a non-communist resistance force. Son Sann, in turn, flew to New York City to ask Prince Norodom Sihanouk (who was preparing to address the UN General Assembly) to lead the KPNLF, but Sihanouk declined and even refused his support.Corfield J. J., \\"A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983.\\" Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 10. In February 1979, General Dien Del and Nguon Pythoureth flew to Thailand to form the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). The two went from camp to camp persuading local leaders to join. Those who agreed to fight under Son Sann were Chea Chhut (at Nong Chan), ex-Khmer National Armed Forces Colonel Prum Vith, Ta Maing and Om Luot (at Nong Samet). By mid-1979 there were 1600 armed soldiers in the KPNLAF. In August 1979 Son Sann went to Thailand with his sons (Son Soubert and Son Monir), Neang Chin Han (former Director of the Executive Cabinet under President Lon Nol), Madame Suon Kaset Sokhomaly, Colonel Thou Thip, Colonel Ea Chuor Kim Meng, Suon Sophat and Buon Say, all from France. The KPNLF was proclaimed on October 9 at Sok Sann, a camp in the jungles of the Cardamom Mountains that contained \\"barely 2000 menBekaert, J., \\"Kampuchea: The Year of the Nationalists?\\" Southeast Asian Affairs, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore (1983), pp. 169.\\" and was a merger of 13 quite disparate groups such as the Khleang Moeung (500 men), Cobra (led by Colonel Prum Vith) and Khmer Islam Movement, the Prey Veng, the Nationalist Movement, Oknha Son Kuy, Kauv Tjlok, the Khmer Neutralist Movement, the Black Indra, United Free Khmer, ASW, Tonle Bassak, and the Kompong Thom Movement. The following month the first shipment of 3000 rifles arrived from Beijing. Son Sann assumed the leadership of the KPNLF together with an executive committee and a military council.Corfield J. J., \\"A History of the Cambodian Non- Communist Resistance, 1975-1983.\\" Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 11. The KPNLF was thus established as a right-wing, pro-Western, anti-Communist political faction in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed and backed People's Republic of Kampuchea.\\"The Khmer People's National Liberation Front,\\" Country Studies. US President Ronald Reagan authorized the provision of aid to KPNLF in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.\\"Cambodia at a Crossroads\\", by Michael Johns, The World and I magazine, February 1988. In 1982, the U.S. government initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only. This amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988. In late 1988, the United States pared back CIA funding to $8 million, following reports that $3.5 million had been diverted by the Thai military. At the same time, the Reagan Administration gave new flexibility to the funds, permitting the NCR to purchase US-made weapons in Singapore and other regional markets. In 1985, the United States established a separate, overt aid program to the non-communist resistance which came to be known as the Solarz Fund after one of its chief sponsors, Rep. Stephen Solarz. The overt aid program channeled about $5 million per year of humanitarian aid to the non-communist resistance through USAID.REFUGEE WARRIORS AT THE THAI-CAMBODIAN BORDER by Cortland Robinson Flag of the KPNLF, reusing the flag of the former Khmer Republic (1970-1975) Political force prior to the Paris Peace Accords Since its beginning, the KPNLF had depended on international financial aid to help maintain their civilian camps and carry out military operations. Sann was critical for gathering this financial aid, as well as increasing international awareness of KPNLF's cause. In fact, in 1982 he went on a fundraising trip to the United States and Europe. Sann was very popular with his quiet, humble demeanor and engaging personality.Elizabeth Becker, \\"The Quiet Cambodian,\\" The New Republic 186, no. 2 (2000): 18-19. In addition to Sann's trips, the KPNLF trumpeted their status as the first non-communist anti-PRK faction inside of Cambodia. This increased financial aid because it appealed to the \\"Western\\" forces that were interested in ousting the Vietnamese yet not supporting the Khmer Rouge. In order to increase their political clout and legitimacy, the KPNLF joined with the Khmer Rouge (at this point in time officially called the Party of Democratic Kampuchea) and Prince Sihanouk's United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Co-operative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). Even though both the KPNLF and FUNCINPEC did not agree with the Khmer Rouge's philosophy and methodology, they still joined the CGDK for the increased international legitimacy and recognition. This increase came because it appeared as if native Cambodians were putting aside their differences and banding together to remove a foreign occupier. In fact, some believe that this coalition was formed in part due to external pressures because the CGDK was allowed to occupy the Cambodian seat in the UN, even though the coalition lacked the normal prerequisites for such recognition.Trevor Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), 1-2. Military force The military branch of the KPNLF was the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). Established originally in March 1979 by General Dien Del, it was commanded by Sak Sutsakhan from 1981-1992 (with the exception of some power struggles).Rodney Tasker,, \\"Up Against the Odds\\" Far Eastern Economic Review 131, no.3 (1986):22-23. However, in an individual unit the commander was relatively autonomous, therefore General Sak had the difficult job of coordinating the actions of each unit. This understandably led to a lot of confusion and relative ineffectiveness for large-scale battles. On the other hand, this organization reaped benefits in the form of greater flexibility and mobility of the armed forces. Despite this military tendency to act in the form of individual unit attacks, occasionally the KPNLAF would join with other separatist forces to launch a large-scale assault on a specific target or area. For example, on March 28, 1986 the CGDK launched a successful raid on Battambang, Cambodia's second largest city.Rodney Tasker, \\"The Reality of Coalition,\\" Far Eastern Economic Review 133, no.28 (1986): 11-12. For the KPNLAF large-scale military actions were stopped after the Vietnamese dry season offensive in 1984-1985. These attacks were devastating, yet not completely debilitating. Even after the huge loss of approximately 30% of its men and material, the KPNLAF was still able to carry out guerrilla operations for the rest of its existence. Infighting before the Paris Peace Accords As with many political groups, the KPNLF had its fair share of party infighting. During its history, two major divides have occurred: one before the Paris Peace Accords in 1991 and one after the UN-backed elections of 1993. Public knowledge of the first divide began in late December 1985. On one side was Son Sann, president of the faction. On the other side were the usurpers led by military commander Sak Sutsakhan, his chief of staff Dien Del, and party members Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn. The dissenters' charges against Sann included an unwillingness to attack the Vietnamese in coordination with Sihanouk's forces and supposed meddling in military affairs, both of which led to greater military impotence. They also accused Sann of being undemocratic and \\"ruling with an iron fist.\\" On Jan. 2 the dissidents released a statement saying that they had control of the faction. Dien Del and Sutsakhan had formed the Provisional Central Committee of Salvation whose function was to command the party. Sann then released a counter-statement saying the actions of Dien and Sutsakhan were both illegal and against the spirit of the party, but that they would still be welcomed back to the party if they stopped this divisive action. On the other hand, for Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn, Sann believed that disciplinary action was necessary in order to rejoin the party. Sann continued on and said he had the support of the United States, ASEAN, and China (the three major financial backers of the KPNLF). However, the infighting continued because neither side had the power to defeat the other. As the months wore on, Thai authorities became concerned with the KPNLF and in particular, the KPNLAF's abilities to wage war against the PRK because of divided leadership. Therefore, the Thais helped establish (in March 1986) a 10-member provisional military committee without the knowledge of Sutsakhan or Sann. The committee's purpose was to command the military operations of the KPNLAF until the conflict was over. Members of the committee included Dien Del from the Sutsakhan camp and the new head of Sann's Command committee, Prum Vith. The dissidence was finally resolved with the help of a third party. While Sann was allowed to keep the title of the presidency and many of the civilian powers that go with it, Sutsakhan retained his military command of both the faction and joint operations between the KPNLAF and FUNCINPEC. However, the peace did not last forever, and after the Paris Peace Accords were implemented Sutsakhan formed the Liberal Democratic Party, an offshoot political branch of the KPNLF.Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, 3. Life after the Paris Peace Accords In 1991, France and Indonesia called for a peace conference about the civil war in Cambodia. All four factions inside of Cambodia attended, as well as the UN and many prominent foreign nations (e.g., United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom). The goal of the conference was to establish a united, peaceful, and neutral democracy in Cambodia.From Paris Peace Agreement, October 23, 1991. In October 1991, all attending parties signed the Paris Peace Agreement. The agreement called for UN sanctioned elections in 1993 to determine the future government of Cambodia. During the time span in between the signing of the peace agreement and the election, Cambodia would be watched over by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The peace agreement stipulated that all four factions must cooperate with UNTAC to slowly disarm their fighting forces. All of the factions did so except for the Khmer Rouge, who then protested and did not partake in the election. The necessity to change from a military faction to a political party facilitated a name change. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front became the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. The name change did not result from a deviation in the platform or structure of the KPNLF, with the exception of the loss of the KPNLAF and the previously mentioned Sutsakhan breakaway party. The BLDP was still led by Son Sann, and in the UN sanctioned elections of 1993 the BLDP won 10 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly.Findlay, Cambodia The Legacy and Lessons of UNTAC, 84. Due to the inability of any one party to win an absolute majority, the BLDP became a junior member of a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party (formerly the PRK) and FUNCINPEC. Being a part of the coalition entitled the party to a position in the power-sharing cabinet and an important chair on a commission for the National Assembly (e.g., Ieng Mouly was the Minister of Information, and Kem Sokha was chairman on the National Assembly's Human Rights Commission.)Matthew Lee, \\"Divided we Fall,\\" Far Eastern Economic Review 158, no.30 (1995): 31 Infighting after the Paris Peace Accords and the dismantling of the BLDP As in early 1986, there was a dissension among the party ranks in 1995. However, this time it was not a disagreement between military and political control, but a conflict between two politicians: Son Sann and Ieng Mouly. According to sources, Sann and Mouly had been arguing about different topics for many years. Some of their more vocal disagreements were: Sann being fiercely anti-Vietnamese, Sann's hasty rescinded order to boycott the 1993 UN elections, and Mouly's questioning of the appropriateness of the Cambodian monarchy being involved in the new democracy. Despite these differences and so many more not mentioned, Mouly and Sann reached a type of power-sharing agreement after the 1993 elections. In exchange for Sann remaining the head of the party, Mouly would get the party's only cabinet position (minister of information). The two decided on this arrangement because it was better to keep the BLDP together, rather than split and lose the party's legislative power, as well as its position in the power sharing coalition. However this arrangement did not last very long, for in 1995 the two sides quarreled. To begin with, Sann constantly supported anti- Vietnamese legislation. This irritated Mouly and his supporters, essentially keeping tension between the two groups from subsiding. The boiling point was finally reached when Sann supporters announced that Mouly had been kicked out of the party. This set off a firestorm and Mouly's side immediately responded in kind, stating the opposite: Sann, instead of Mouly, had been removed from the party. As time passed, the latter turned out to be true. On July 9, 1995 Ieng Mouly summoned a special congress of the BLDP in order to select new leadership. Due to the non-attendance of Son Sann and his supporters, Mouly was elected unanimously by the congress. However, shortly after the congress, the BLDP dissolved. Mouly went on to become leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Sann's supporters created the Son Sann party. Neither side has won a seat in the National Assembly since the split.
