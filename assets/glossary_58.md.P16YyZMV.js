Life and work Imdahl studied studio painting, art history, archaeology and German literature at the University of M√ºnster. For his paintings he won the Blevins Davis Prize, the most prestigious art contest of the postwar period in Germany,Hans Krabbendam and Giles Scott-Smith, The Cultural Cold War in Western Europe, 1945-60. Abingdon, Oxon, 2003, p. 293. in 1950. In 1951 he completed his Ph.D. dissertation on the treatment of color in late Carolingian book illustration under Werner Hager. He worked as an assistant professor at the University of M√ºnster for some years and wrote his Habilitationsschrift on Ottonian Art in 1961. In 1965, he was appointed professor of art history at the newly founded Ruhr Universit√§t Bochum, where he was engaged in promoting modern art and in advising the university's modern art collection. From 1986 until his death, he was also a member of the German Academy of Arts. Imdahl formulated a methodology he called \\"the Iconic,\\" using an artwork's structure to determine its significance.Max Imdahl, Giotto: Arenafresken: Ikonographie, Ikonologie, Ikonik. Munich: W. Fink, 1980. His color analyses are characteristic of his approach. Furthermore, he primarily focused on examinations of the work of individual painters. Marxist interpreters accused him of using analytical methods that lacked historical awareness. They also criticized his preference for concrete (object-free) Western Art. In contrast, he found support for his ideas among philosophers and Catholic theologians.

He previously played for the San Diego Padres. Minor league career The Boston Red Sox signed Margot as an international free agent from the Dominican Prospect League in July 2011, receiving a reported bonus of $800,000. At age 17, he started his professional career with Rookie Level Dominican Summer League Red Sox in their 2012 season. In his professional debut, Margot earned Red Sox Minor League Latin Program Player of the Year honors, after batting a .285/.382/.423 slash line with 38 stolen bases in just 68 games, gaining a spot on the DSL All-Star team. Regarded as a patient hitter, he walked more than he struck out in the DSL (36-to-25 in 260 at-bats). Margot jumped up two levels to the Lowell Spinners in 2013, and played as the youngest regular in the Short-Season A New York‚ÄìPenn League. Following his successful debut, Margot did manage to get a hit in 12 out of his first 15 games with Lowell, collecting a .254/.343/.307 line through July 24, when a hamstring injury laid him up. After a disabled list stint, he returned on August 16 showing glimpses of his potential with a .447/.475/.658 line over his first eight games back. He finished the year with a .270 average and 18 stolen bases in only 49 games. Margot played for the Low A Greenville Drive of the South Atlantic League in 2014. In his first 99 games at Greenville, he posted a .282/.362/.418 line with 10 home runs and 45 runs batted in, while leading the Drive with 105 hits and 61 runs scored, and the Red Sox organization with 39 stolen bases. As a result, he was promoted to High A Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League on August 15. In 2014, Margot hit .340/.356/.560 in just 18 games for Salem, combining for a .293/.356/.462 line with 12 homers and 59 RBI in 115 contests in the two stints. Besides, he led the Sox minors system with 42 stolen bases. It was just the latest part in what was a very solid season in the organization despite his youth. As such, he climbed from No. 11 to No. 4 in the MLB.com Top 20 Boston Red Sox Prospects list. In 2015, Margot improved his slash line up to .282/.321/.420 through 46 games with Salem, and earned a promotion to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs in the midseason. His five triples were tied for third-most in the Carolina League, while his 20 steals in 25 attempts ranked fourth in the circuit at the time of his promotion. Soon after, MLB.com announced that he would be member of the World Team in the Futures Game prior to the Major League All-Star Game.Margot selected to MLB All-Star Futures Game. MiLB.com. Retrieved on June 26, 2015. Margot then posted a combined .271/.326/.419 batting line with 25 extra bases and 19 steals over 109 games played for the Sea Dogs. During the Sea Dogs annual Field of Dream Fan Appreciation Game at Hadlock Field, he hit for the cycle and drove in a season-high five runs as the Sea Dogs topped the New Britain Rock Cats, 10‚Äì5, becoming the first ever Portland player to hit a cycle at Hadlock Field.Margot hits hits for cycle to lead Sea Dogs take win on ‚ÄòField of Dreams‚Äô day at Hadlock. PressHerald.com. Retrieved on September 7, 2015. On November 13, 2015, the Red Sox traded Margot, Javier Guerra, Carlos Asuaje, and Logan Allen to the San Diego Padres for Craig Kimbrel. On November 19, 2015, the Padres added Margot to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Margot began the 2016 season with the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas, where he played in 124 games, including 117 starts in center field. He batted .304 with 6 home runs and a .777 OPS. The Padres promoted him to the major leagues on September 21, 2016. Major league career =San Diego Padres= In his September, 2016, call up, Margot played in 10 games, including seven starts in center field and one in right. Despite a knee injury that limited his playing time in spring training, Margot made the 2017 Opening Day roster as the starting center fielder. Margot hit five extra-base hits in his first six games of the 2017 season, including two home runs in consecutive plate appearances against San Francisco Giants starter Matt Cain on April 8, and two doubles off of Giants starter Madison Bumgarner on April 9. Margot missed about a month of the season in May and June with a calf injury. Margot finished the 2017 season with a .263/.313/.409 batting line with 13 home runs in 126 games, including 121 starts in center field. He finished sixth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. Margot was the Padres regular center fielder in 2018, starting 123 games there, and only missing 10 days on the disabled list with bruised ribs in April. His batting line on the season dropped to .245/.292/.384 with 8 home runs and 11 stolen bases. He was considered to be a plus defender in center field, without making many highlight plays. Margot began losing time in center field in 2019, making 98 starts there while Wil Myers picked up 58 of the center field starts. Margot effectively became part of a platoon with left-handed hitting corner outfielder Josh Naylor in the latter part of the season. Margot still played in a career-high 151 games on the season, often coming in as a pinch hitter or defensive replacement. Margot batted .234/.304/.387 on the year, with 12 home runs in 398 at-bats. He had 20 stolen bases in 24 attempts. On defense, Margot led the Padres with 11 outs above average, ranking fourth in the National League. =Tampa Bay Rays= On February 8, 2020, the Padres traded Margot and prospect Logan Driscoll to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Emilio Pag√°n. Personal life Margot's wife, Rachell, gave birth to a son, Diamond, in July, 2017. The family added a second child in April, 2019.

It is among the most widely used high power RF connectors in cellular network antenna systems. Originally popular in Europe, it has gained widespread use in the US and elsewhere. It is not to be confused with the similar-sounding EIA flange adaptors which are referred to by the outer diameter in fractions of an inch. The 7-16 DIN connector out performs other non-flange options, such as N connectors or BNC connectors, when it comes to interference and intermodulation rejection or higher power handling at RF frequencies. 7/16 DIN is a high power RF connector widely used in antenna systems or base stations that supplies better performances concerning interference and intermodulation rejection. The inner contact on the 7/16 DIN connector measures 7mm while the outer contact on the connector measures 16 mm. DIN is an acronym for the Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung, the standards organization that harmonised the standard for the connector. (Previously the 7-16 had been developed as a military 'special' and made by Spinner and others.) The 7/16 is a reference to the 7 mm O.D. of the female inner contact and the corresponding 16 mm I.D. of the outer contact. The external thread is 29mm, 1.5mm pitch. As with all RF connectors the safe power handling is determined by the heating and subsequent oxidation of the centre 'pin' for continuous operation at high frequencies, and by voltage breakdown between inner and outer at lower frequencies, or short pulse operation, and for reliable high power operation, connectors must be assembled with careful attention to cleanliness and alignment. In practice the power handling curve is a complex function of frequency, and extrapolating from spot frequency figures can be misleading, if in doubt the maker's data should always be consulted. L29 means it has 29 mm left-hand thread. There are larger connectors in the same family, the 13-30 DIN (external thread 50mm thread, 3mm pitch) and the (rare) 25-58 DIN permitting progressively higher power handling still (approximately twice and four times respectively), but as the cables to suit these connectors are rare, neither connector is yet to gain the same near-universal popularity as the 7-16 DIN, and these still remain unseen outside the domain of a few speciality broadcast equipment manufacturers. 13-30DIN 25-58 DIN  Usage  According to the Utilities Telecom Council journal, > 7/16 DIN connectors are used in antenna systems where there are multiple > transmitters using the same antenna or where a base station antenna is co- > located with a large number of other transmitting antennas... These > connectors produce lower inter-modulation distortion products and thus are > specified at busy RF sites and in almost all trunking systems where multiple > transmitters share a common antenna.

References to the song can be dated back to 1586, in a letter from Sir Walter Raleigh to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester saying \\"The Queen is in very good terms with you now, and, thanks be to God, will be pacified, and you are again her Sweet Robin.\\" Although the words have been lost, it is suspected that the character Ophelia, of Hamlet (who is specified in the First Quarto to be a lutenist), sings the last line of the tune (\\"For bonny sweet Robin is all my Joy\\") during her madness (IV, v, 187). Some scholars believe that Shakespeare's choice of the song was meant to invoke phallic symbolism.  Settings  As was common during the renaissance, many composers wrote variations or divisions based on the piece. Two sets of variations can be found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, one by John Munday and the other by Giles Farnaby. The work was commonly set for lute. It appears twice in William Ballet's lute book, in the Pickering Lute book, Anthony Holborne's Cittharn Schoole (1597), and Thomas Robinson's Schoole of Musicke (1603). There exists also a manuscript of John Dowland's setting. The tune was often used for other texts too, such ballads can be found in the Roxburghe Ballads and in The Crown Garden of Golden Roses, and was used as such into the 18th century in Music for the Tea Table Miscellany (1725) More recently, the song inspired Percy Grainger's \\"music room rambling\\" (as he described it) for which he wrote three instrumentations: solo piano; violin, cello and piano; and strings, flute and English horn.

He was a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court from 1933 until his death. Biography Charles B. Zimmerman was born June 22, 1891 in Springfield, Ohio to John Luther and Helen Ballard Zimmerman. After graduating from Wittenberg University in 1911, he attended Harvard Law School from 1911 to 1913. Zimmerman returned to Ohio, where he was admitted to the bar in 1913, and was admitted to practice in the federal courts and before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1915. He practiced in Springfield with his father and brother from 1913 to 1933. From 1917 to 1919, he was an officer with the Ohio National Guard and the 4th and 82nd Divisions of the U.S. Army. He was a major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. Zimmerman lost election for Ohio's 7th congressional district as the Democratic nominee in 1922, lost election for Ohio Attorney General in 1926, and lost election for the Ohio Supreme Court in 1932. Robert H. Day, a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, died September 29, 1933. On October 4, 1933, Ohio Governor George White appointed Zimmerman to fill Day's unexpired term. He took the oath of office on October 10. In 1934, Zimmerman chose not to run for the short term, the last two months of Day's term, but did run for a full six- year term. W. F. Garver won the short term, and served from November to December 31, 1934. Zimmerman won the full term. Zimmerman ran for re-election in 1940, 1946, 1952, 1958, and 1964, winning each time. He announced in 1967 that he would not seek re-election in 1970, and intended to return to private practice in Springfield with his son. In May 1969, a lung tumor was discovered and surgically removed, but Zimmerman died at University Hospital, Columbus on June 4, 1969. The funeral was at First Lutheran Church in Springfield, where he was a member, and burial was at Ferncliff Cemetery in Springfield. Zimmerman married Dorothy Gayford in 1930, and three children were born to them. Zimmeman never bought a house in the state capital of Columbus, he rode a bus from Springfield at the beginning of each week, and rode back to Springfield each Friday. He slept on a cot in his office.

History Cowper's mother, Ann, died when she was 36 years old in 1737, when Cowper was six years old. Her husband, John, built a monument after she died, with an inscription that begins, \\"Here lies, in early years bereft of life, the best of mothers and the kindest wife\\". Cowper, then 58 years old, received a picture of his mother in 1790, given to him by his cousin Ann Bodham. In response to her giving him the gift, he said, \\"Every creature who bears any affinity to my mother, is dear to me. I love you, therefore, and love you so much, both for her sake and your own\\". He wrote in a letter that he would rather have possession of the picture \\"than the richest jewel in the British crown\\". The poem was written because of how important his mother was to him, and as a result of receiving the picture. Completed shortly before his last insanity attack, the poem was first published by itself in 1798, later being published with other poems in 1799. Analyses The Mother's Assistant and Young Lady's Friend wrote in 1846, \\"Perhaps no production of Cowper has been more frequently read, or so much admired, as the poem on the Receipt of his Mother's Picture\\". The Cambridge History of English and America Literature wrote, \\"Thanks to the poet's use of detail, the woman and her little son live again before us, and the tenderness of the whole is unsurpassed.\\" Aaron Santesso said on the front flap of his book A Careful Longing: The Poetics And Problems of Nostalgia that the poem helps \\"contribute to the modern understanding of nostalgia\\". The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review believes that American poet Walt Whitman closely paraphrased a line from Cowper's poem for use in his own poem, titled A Passage To India.

It is not certain whether the Salpe mentioned by Pliny and the Salpe mentioned by Athenaeus were different people. Pliny Pliny cites Salpe six times in his Natural History. She is described by him as an obstetrix, though he ascribes general remedies to her, not simply those concerned with women's health. Her remedies only survive in Pliny's references to them, not in her own words. She uses both herbal and magical remedies to cure a variety of ailments ‚Äì including sunburn, stiff or numbed limbs, and dog bites. Athenaeus In the Deipnosophistae, Athenaeus mentions a Salpe as the writer of Paignia. He cites Nymphodorus of Syracuse, probably writing in the third century BC, as claiming that Salpe, the writer of the Paignia, was not a nickname for a Mnaseas, but was a woman from Lesbos. The Paignia is generally considered to have been a work of pornographic or erotic literature. Athenaeus associates the work with Botrys of Messana, a fifth-century author described as a \\"shameful writer\\" by Timaeus. Botrys' work was apparently similar to the pornographic sex-manual attributed to Philaenis. The work was probably written in prose, as Botrys' earlier paignia had been. James Davidson argues that the Salpe mentioned by Athenaeus and the one cited by Pliny are likely to have been the same person. David Bain has argued against Davidson's suggestion, and I. M. Plant distinguishes between the two in his anthology of ancient women writers. More recently, Rebecca Flemming writes that \\"despite Bain's objections it remains tempting\\" to link Pliny's and Athenaeus' Salpe; she suggests that the original Paignia referred to by Athenaeus was the original source of Pliny's recipes, though he would have read them second-hand (or \\"more probably third- or fourth-hand\\").

This code, written by Dr. Bob MacMillan, is known amongst its primary users as LandMapRMacMillan, R.A., VanDeusen, A.A., 2003. The LandMapR User's Guide. Self-Published. (LandMapR has since become a copyrighted term in the U.S. for an agricultural remote sensing device). LandMapR, and the new open-geomorphometry project, operate digital elevation data to produce maps including but not limited to: hydrological flow, catchments, depression or pits, water pooling, wetness index, topographic derivatives, and landform classifications. Origin LandMapR performs a number of operations on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), from calculating hydrological flow directions, water pooling, to performing sophisticated topographical landform classifications (see for example Jensen et al., (1988),Jensen S.K., Domingue, J.O., 1988. Extracting Topographic Structure from Digital Elevation Data for Geographic Information System Analysis. Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 54(11), 1593-1600. or O'Callaghan et al., (1984)O'Callaghan, J.F., Mark, D.M., 1984. The Extraction of Drainage Networks from Digital Elevation Data. Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, 28, 323-344 and references therein). LandMapR is an all-in-one tool for extracting information from DEMs. The initial version of the software was written by Dr. Bob MacMillan as part of his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Edinburgh in 1993, and was coded in a Microsoft Rapid Application Development language called FoxPro. The FoxPro version exists to today, but is not part of the open source effort due to its restriction as an interpreted language. The open-geomorphometry project makes the much faster C++ version of the software available. Functions The most unusual aspects of LandMapR and the open-geomorphometry project are the algorithms it implements to conduct 'pit' removal. Pits are depressions in the topography. Pits are usually seen as interfering with the flow. Typical pit removal (for example see Jensen et al. (1988)) involves simply removing depressions from DEMs in order to resolve flow paths. LandMapR also conducts these operations on 'spurious' pits, but goes beyond normal pit removal procedures to treat watersheds, which are depressions, as a potential heirachichal path for flows and figures out how one pit might flow into another to produce new flow channels in a field. The applications for this kind of pit-removal are almost unlimited. Water and cold air pooling in vineyards and farm fields represent a serious issue in generating high yield crops. For example, a farm field has recently been fertilized with granular heavy phosphorus fertilizer. Knowing the distribution density of this fertilizer across the field it is possible to use pit removal to calculated the area to flow calculations as well as the potential residence times that would enable an estimate of how much rain is required to carry that fertilizer off into local streams. The area to flow capability of the pit removal calculations in LandMapR are unique. The open-source open-geomorphometry project forms the basis, or the geomorphology part, of some of the work being documented on the Phytogeomorphology page, and is the chosen software tool for much of that work. Hydrology LandMapR as a hydrological tool performs a number of useful operations on DEMs. Within LandMapR are a number of distinct operations. The original code had 19 operators that could be applied sequentially to the datasets. The newer versions in the open source project break the tasks into four areas; flow calculations, pit removal (catchment hydrology), facets (landform derivatives), and form (landform derivatives). Each section has a sequence of output maps. Currently, the flow and pit removal calculations result in 5 major maps: flow direction, upslope contribution/area, watersheds, volume to flood, and millimeters to flood, and several minor maps that show the stages of pit removal. Landform Classification In the limited context of a landform being a component of a farm field topography, LandMapR is used to compute surface derivatives and other topological values, as well as using fuzzy logic to divide a farm field into a collection of landform classes.Robert A. MacMillan, David H. McNabb, R. Keith Jones (September 2000). \\"Conference paper: \\"Automated landform classification using DEMs\\"\\" LandMapR is capable of defining a large number of landform classes and allowing the user to define criterion for membership in each of these classes.

It is managed by Ireland East Hospital Group. History The hospital originally opened as Wexford County Hospital in December 1928, in the premises of the old Wexford Union Workhouse on Old Hospital Road, which had been established on 25 July 1842. From March 1965 to 1978, the County Hospital medical department was moved to Brownswood Hospital in Enniscorthy. Improvements to the existing facilities were completed under the auspices of the South Eastern Health Board during the 1970s. In 1978, the Minister for Health established a group to plan for the hospital's future. Land beside the Newtown Road in Carricklawn close to the County Hospital was made available. The decision to build a new hospital was finalized by the SEHB in November 1982, but it was not until February 1988 that construction of the new building began, and it was completed in 1992. The hospital was renamed Wexford General Hospital at that time. It had been originally intended to demolish the old hospital building, but it was designated as a protected structure, preventing its demolition. In 2010, thousands of people protested about proposed changes to the status of the hospital. In 2013 it was listed in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013, subsequently enacted as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, as one of the institutions where abortions are authorized to be carried out under the Act. In 2014 two new extensions with a combined floor area of 4,600 square metres were completed. In 2017 the Herbert Amon Unit, an early maternity unit, was opened.

The road was created in 1917 and redone in 1940; it has since been widened and tarred. Until 1964, the pass served as pasture for cows of the Abondance breed going to or returning from higher pastures. The large trough served not only for watering the cows but also for cooling the engines of cars that overheated going up the steep slopes. The road was plowed in winter on the Le Biot in 1964 and on the two sides in 1966. = First buildings (1961) = View of the Col du Corbier with \\"Chez L' Henri\\" In April 1961, the town of Le Biot allowed Henri Teninge, restaurant owner in Morzine, originally from Bonnevaux, to build a caf√© restaurant \\"Chez L'Henri\\" on a plot of 4945 m2 belonging to the town at a place called \\"On the Joux.\\" In 1967, the town sold it to him for one franc per square meter.

They launched a study and prepared a very modest project which was rejected by the tax collector who was very reserved about the financial resources of the commune and wished to \\"preserve a typical alpine site.\\" The two towns of Le Biot and Bonnevaux therefore united in 1969 thanks to Messrs Cloppet and Mr.Lachenal, of the mountain commission, to create on 23 January 1970, an \\"inter-communal syndicate for the touristic development of the Corbier - La Joux Verte - Le Biot - Bonnevaux.\\" The committee was composed of four directors under 40 years of age: Ren√© Ainoux (Bonnevaux), president, Georges Premat (Le Biot), vice-president, Gerard Delale (Le Biot), secretary, and Paul Favre-Miville (Bonnevaux). The latter became brother Paul, one of the seven monks murdered in Tibhirine Algeria in 1996 (a monument has been erected in Bonnevaux' cemetery). \\"The shares were distributed as follows: 55% in Biot, 45% Bonnevaux and the protection perimeter defined: 863 hectares for Biot, 467 hectares Bonnevaux.\\" Each municipality provided a 68.000 francs subsidy and the syndicate borrowed 1.150.000 francs from the Credit Agricole bank. The committee reviewed the project, 24 homeowners gave a right of way, the departmental electricity union, thanks to the action of Messrs Lavy, Germain and Vannod, agreed to the establishment of an underground line of 15.000 volts, including two transformers.¬´ Unies dans un m√™me effort, les communes de Bonnevaux et du Biot ont fignol√© l'am√©nagement du col du Corbier ¬ª, Le Dauphin√© lib√©r√©, 27 novembre 1971.

Two forest roads were envisaged, one to Mount Ouzon and the other to Mount Drouzin. The Le Biot school closed in June 1971 because there were only nine children (10 were needed for a class). This led to the mayor Fernand Renevier's resignation; he was replaced by Georges Premat. The school reopened in September 1972. Winter 1971-1972 was the first official season for the Col du Corbier.

Elected officials resigned en bloc. The builder Jacques Ribourel added more property.  Crisis in the council of Le Biot (1993)  In July, the regional audit called for a budget increase of an additional 600.000 francs (it is a quarter of the initial budget of the municipality) for works at the Col du Corbier.

He was born and died at Groby, Leicestershire. He was the uncle of later Leicestershire cricketer Terry Spencer. Smith was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. Early in his career he was considered promising as a batsman and scarcely bowled, but his batting did not develop and although he often made runs he was largely \\"a useful hitter\\". Smith's obituary was omitted from the 1949 Wisden and ran instead in an addendum to the obituaries in the 1950 edition. Unusually for the fast bowlers of his period, he was a good fielder, taking 257 catches in his 341 first-class games. Cricket career In 1924, Leicestershire, to that point one of the weaker first-class cricket counties, decided that a more professional approach was needed for success; the club appointed its first-ever professional coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and entered a second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. Smith, Horace Snary and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system, and Smith made his first-class debut in the 1925 season. He played in 19 matches in that season but took only 12 wickets. At this stage he was apparently regarded primarily as a batting all-rounder: he hit three scores of more than 50 in the season, though his batting average for 448 runs was only 13.57. Over the next two seasons his figures got worse in terms of number of matches played, batting average and number of wickets taken. Smith's first breakthrough season as a bowler was 1928. George Geary was injured for much of the season and unable to bowl much even when he played as a batsman, and Smith stepped up to open the bowling regularly: he took 80 wickets at an average of 26.36. \\"Tall and strong, he bowled fairly fast, with a good high action that made the ball gather pace from the pitch,\\" Wisden wrote. Geary's return to fitness in 1929 meant fewer opportunities for Smith, however, and over the two following seasons, 1930 and 1931, he appeared in only half the first team's matches and took only around 30 or so wickets each year. Smith's second breakthrough season was 1932 when he appeared in all matches and compensated for the decline in other bowlers such as Snary and Alan Shipman by taking 83 wickets at an average of 25.73. In fact, Smith continued to prosper as his colleagues declined: in 1933, Leicestershire experienced what Wisden termed \\"their worst season since they were promoted to first-class rank in 1895\\". The county finished at the bottom of the County Championship table for the first time, and both batting weaknesses and ageing bowlers were exposed; Smith, by contrast, had his best season yet and his 118 wickets put him at the top of the county's bowling averages. He did not maintain that leading position in 1934 as other bowlers recovered their form, but in fact his figures were better: 121 wickets at an average of 22.56. His second innings analysis of six wickets for 39 runs was responsible for Leicestershire's first victory over Yorkshire for 23 years. The Times report said that it was \\"the most sensational victory of the season\\": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. The 1935 season was, wrote Wisden, \\"the most successful in the history of the club\\" and Smith's bowling in combination with Geary was singled out as a prime reason: \\"It is no exaggeration to say that last season no other county save Yorkshire could boast of two such consistently successful bowlers,\\" it said. In early June, the pair bowled unchanged through four consecutive County Championship match innings, culminating in the game against Northamptonshire when Smith took eight for 44 and three for 47, and Geary took two for 32 and seven for 30 to win the game by an innings inside two days. In all matches, Smith took 150 wickets, his best total, at an average of 19.66, which was also his best bowling average in any season; he took five or more wickets in an innings 15 times and 10 wickets in a match five times. Over the next four seasons, Leicestershire's fortunes declined to the point where they were bottom of the County Championship again in 1939; Smith never achieved again the number of wickets or the economy he had done in 1935, but he remained a significant wicket-taker right through to 1939. In both 1936 and 1937 he took 100 wickets in the season again, heading the county's average in the second of those year. It was in 1937 too that Smith finally came good as a batsman: in the game against Worcestershire he scored an unbeaten 100, his runs coming out of 154 scored while he was at the wicket. It was the only century of his career and 1937 was the only season in which batting average was higher than 15. Smith's bowling slipped below 100 wickets in the 1938 season, but the 92 that he took included a return of eight wickets for 40 runs in the match against Gloucestershire and these were the best figures of his career. Smith was still Leicestershire's leading wicket- taker in 1939, but in a poor season the number had declined to 77. Smith continued to play in non-first-class matches for Leicestershire throughout the Second World War but he was 45 when first-class cricket resumed in 1946 and he did not play again. At the time of his sudden death at the age of 47 in 1948 he was the groundsman and cricket coach at Ashby Grammar School.

The store has a specific emphasis on the sale of men's suits, trousers, denim, shirts, shorts, swimwear, outerwear and accessories. The company was founded by Stanford Business School students Andy Dunn and co-founder Brian Spaly, and launched as an exclusively online retailer in 2007. In 2012, Bonobos diversified to incorporate physical retail locations with the launch of their \\"Guideshop\\" locations, as well as through a partnership with fellow fashion firm Nordstrom. On 16 June 2017, Walmart agreed to acquire Bonobos for the sum of $310 million, making it a subsidiary within its fashion department.Walmart Bonobos Merger nytimes.com 2017/06/16Walmart to Acquire Bonobos and Appoint Andy Dunn to Oversee Exclusive Consumer Brands Offered Online businesswire.com June 16, 2017ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, Walmart to acquire online men's clothing retailer Bonobos The Associated Press JUNE 16, 2017  History  = Early history = The firm was founded by Brian Spaly who began designing men's pants while at Stanford Business School. They featured a curved waistband, a medium rise and a tailored thigh that fit better and eliminated \\"khaki diaper butt.\\" As demand grew, he and housemate Andy Dunn decided to pursue the project as a business opportunity. Initially, the brand was launched exclusively online. Dunn cashed in his 401(k) to build Bonobos.com and raised a round of angel investment. Initial investors included Wealthfront CEO and former venture capitalist, Andy Rachleff, and JetBlue Chairman and founding Bonobos board member Joel Peterson, both of whom had lectured Dunn at Stanford Business School. Dunn then moved to New York City with 400 pairs of pants that he picked, packed and shipped from his Union Square apartment. Within six months, the firm grew to five employees and a $1 million net revenue run rate. In its first three years, the company received over $7 million in funding from angel investors. In 2009, Spaly moved on to another venture, running the Chicago-based fashion commerce company Trunk Club. In 2010, the company received its first institutionally-driven financing round, raising $18.5 million from Accel Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners. As part of the round, Accel Partners' Sameer Gandhi and Lightspeed Venture Partners' Jeremy Liew joined Bonobos' board. As Bonobos expanded its assortment to include suits, dress shirts, outerwear and tailored pieces, more customers requested the opportunity to \\"try before they buy\\". In fall 2011, the company tested an e-commerce store at their New York City headquarters, calling the location a Guideshop. The purpose of the Guideshop location was to provide a physical space for men to try on Bonobos prior to e-commerce transactions being placed. Within a year, the concept became an integral part of the firm's service and business model. = Company growth (2012-2017) = In 2012, Bonobos closed a $16.4 million strategic minority investment round led by Nordstrom, with participation from existing investors. In tandem, Bonobos partnered with Nordstrom to sell the brand‚Äôs clothing in their full-line stores and their website. Bonobos furthered its offline reach in May 2012, opening its first standalone Guideshop location in Boston. By January 2013, Bonobos had opened additional Guideshop locations in Chicago, Georgetown and San Francisco. Bonobos announced a $30 million round in 2013, with Glynn Capital and Mousse Partners joining existing investors Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Forerunner Ventures and Nordstrom. At this time, Forerunner's Managing Partner Kirsten Green joined the Bonobos board and total funding to date reached nearly $73 million. Simultaneously, the company launched the golf brand Maide, which is the second brand launched by the Bonobos team. By August 2013, Bonobos had opened Guideshop locations on Crosby Street in New York City, Bethesda, MD, Austin, TX, and luxury shopping enclave of Greenwich Avenue, in Greenwich, CT bringing total location count to nine. By August 2013 employee headcount reached 175. Dunn temporarily hired Francine Della Badia, the former head of Coach's North American retail division and Victoria¬¥s Secret, to take his place in summer 2015. Three months later she stepped down, because \\"she felt she couldn‚Äôt change the company‚Äôs culture\\", and Dunn re-assumed the role. = Recent history (2017-) = In June 2017, Walmart announced it was purchasing the brand for $310 million in cash. The brand will not be sold in the Walmart stores, instead it will be sold on Walmart's recently purchased Jet.com. Bonobos CEO Andy Dunn remained with the company after the purchase. He became Walmart's senior vice president of digital brands, which also includes Allswell. Micky Onvural, who had joined Bonobos as CMO in 2015, became the new CEO. Operations Bonobos \\"Ninjas\\" are a team of customer service representatives tasked with providing quality customer service for the company‚Äôs e-commerce site. Dunn conceptualized the name to attract college-educated qualified candidates to the job and to emphasize Bonobos‚Äô desire to provide great customer service. Bonobos Ninjas interact with customers through phone, email, chat, and social media. It has been covered in national publications such as The New York Times, USA Today, CNBC, The Boston Globe, Chicago Sun Times, San Francisco Chronicle, among others.  Technology  In early 2012, Bonobos opened a West Coast office to build a Silicon Valley-based technology team, in an effort to expand its nationwide retail presence. Following 18 months, the firm attempted to minimise inefficiencies by eliminating bi-coastal offices, which were then redundant. Hence, in 2013, Bonobos relocated the technology arm to its New York City headquarters.

He was the founder and publisher of the Chicago Reader, one of the most influential and successful newspapers of its type. He was also one of the founders and the first president of Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, located in Chicago. Intuit is the only nonprofit organization in the U.S. dedicated solely to presenting \\"outsider\\" art by self-taught artists. Roth grew up in Arlington Heights, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, graduating magna cum laude in 1969. In the fall of that year he began graduate studies in political philosophy at the University of Chicago, but before earning a degree he left to devote his energies to the Reader, which he started with a group of Carleton friends in 1971. The Reader was one of the first and ultimately one of the most successful in a genre of urban newspapers that came to be known as the alternative weekly. Roth modeled it after New York's Village Voice and papers he had seen in Boston, but with one important difference: the Reader was free, distributed at bookstores, bars and shops. At the time, free circulation was disreputable. Roth, who was president of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies from 1983 to 1987, proselytized for the free model and, as the Reader prospered, papers in other cities began to adopt it. By 1996, when the Village Voice converted to free circulation, the entire industry had followed the Readers lead. Roth was publisher of the Reader from 1971 to 1994, editor and publisher from 1975 to 1990, and president of the company until it was sold in 2007. In addition he was president of the company that published Washington City Paper, which was owned by the same group and also sold in 2007. Since then Roth has been president of Quarterfold, Inc., which holds former Reader assets not transferred in the sale, including an interest in Index Newspapers, the company that publishes The Stranger of Seattle and the Portland Mercury in Oregon. Roth began collecting art in the mid-1980s. By 2005, his collection comprised more than 1,000 pieces, most by untrained artists such as Henry Darger, Steve Ashby and Sam Doyle. In 2008, he was named in Arts & Antiques magazine‚Äôs list of 250 \\"Top Collectors\\". He was president of Intuit (see above) from 1991 to 1996 and remains on the board of directors.

Early life Thornton was born on October 28, 1800, at Fall Hill near Fredericksburg, Virginia, to Francis Thornton IV and Sallie Innes. His father was a successful physician, politician and planter who was second cousin to George Washington and held great prominence in the local community. His mother was the daughter of a wealthy Scottish merchant who had arrived in Virginia around the time of the American Revolution. Thornton was largely educated by private itinerant educators who would reside at the Thornton family estate. He graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1820 and moved to Huntsville, Alabama, to practice law with his brother Harry Innes Thornton. Political career Thornton's strong familial ties encouraged an endeavor into politics fueled by a successful law practice and considerable wealth from the plantation he had developed upon arriving in the state. He was elected in 1824 as Secretary of State of Alabama and in the same year appointed by the Governor of Alabama as the official state escort to the Marquis de Lafayette on his 1825 return and tour of the United States. Thornton proved to be highly successful and respected in his political office and subsequently dissolved his law practice. He served for ten years as Secretary of State lasting through five Governors. Plantation Thornhill main house In 1824, Thornton began to actively develop a large plot of land he had acquired in Greene County, Alabama. A significant reason for his emigration to the Deep South, like many men from prominent Virginia families, was to expand his wealth far beyond what was feasible in Virginia. In 1825, he married his first wife, Mary Ann Glover, whose family had already begun to develop lucrative cotton plantations in the area. Thornton's business prowess resulted in his plantation which he named Thornhill becoming one of the most successful in the region. The house is traditionally believed to be a derivation of the name of William Thornton the first of Thornton's ancestors in America. The main house at Thornhill was completed in the Greek Revival style in 1833. The architect or housewright responsible for the design and construction of the house is not known though it is similar in style and construction to Rosemount, a neighboring plantation which belonged to his brother-in-law Williamson Allen Glover. There is strong evidence to indicate that both buildings were designed by the Alabama architect William Nichols, who served as State Architect during Thornton's tenure in government. In addition to the main house there is a small school house stylistically in keeping with the main house; the structural arrangement reflects that of Thornton's childhood home Fall Hill which has a small school house set several yards away from the carriage entrance of the house. Thornhill is considered one of the most significant antebellum plantation complexes in Alabama. The plantation buildings were recorded in the 1930s by the Historic American Buildings Survey. The main house has been recreated in miniature as an example of plantation architecture for the American Museum in Britain near Bath, UK. Family Thornton was born to a prominent Virginia family with substantial land and slave holdings and diverse business interests in their native state including, blast furnaces, grist mills, lumber mills, ships and commercial enterprises. The first of his ancestors, William Thornton, had arrived in America sometime before 1649, and established large land holdings in Gloucester County, Virginia, but eventually passed the property on to his son William before his death and his lands in Richmond County to his son Rowland and moved to modern day Stafford County, Virginia, with his son Francis. This move established Thornton's family and their wealth around the Fredericksburg area. Over time, the family estates were divided among more and more branches which diminished the individual wealth of family members but maintained their overall economic and political strength. Their marriages and familial connections brought three Presidents into his family George Washington, James Madison and Zachary Taylor. Though many had improved their positions through advantageous marriage, it is likely that Thornton and his brother were more prudent in seeking to establish themselves in the booming cotton regions. Thornton's first marriage was to Mary Ann Glover (1808 - 1830), a native of Alabama who was the daughter of Allen Glover and Sarah Norwood. The Glover's had been a moderately affluent South Carolina family who, by the time of Thornton's marriage, had acquired vast land and slave holdings. Glover died within five years of their marriage and Thornton returned to Fredericksburg in 1830 and married his former neighbor and kinsman Anne Amelia Smith, the daughter of George Alexander Smith and Delia Forbes. Smith was connected to the Innes family through their Scottish lines and both of her parents were from prominent Scottish families descended from the Erskines of Alva and Aloa. Smith's brother, Murray Forbes Smith, brought great economic backing to Thornton through his cotton brokerage set up in Mobile. Through Smith, Thornton was the uncle of Alva Vanderblit Belmont. Thornton's last marriage was to Sarah Williams Gould, the daughter William Proctor Gould and Eliza Williams Chotard. She was the widow of Samuel Merritt Gowdey. Sarah Gould Thornton outlived her husband, dying in 1885.

Suarbol was famous for owning the biggest palloza in the shire of Los Ancares, but unfortunately it was burned in 1957; the site, where it stood, already remains. However some other pallozas in good state of preservation stand and can be visited in the village. There are also some horreos in square-shaped floor and in slate roofs (similar to the Asturian horreo) in Suarbol. In the past, most building roofs were made of straw and were known as teitos, nonetheless most building roofs today are made of slate just like most of the towns and villages of the region of El Bierzo. The most outstanding monument is the Parish Church of Suarbol. It is a Baroque style building and was declared Good of Cultural Interest in 1995 by the Spanish government. The graveyard of the town is inside the church yard, a characteristic uncommon in Spain. Suarbol also owns other monuments like the Roman Causeway of Suarbol, a path linking the gold mines of Ibias in Asturias to other gold mines in the region of El Bierzo in the Roman times.

He was a younger son of Robert ap Rhys of Plas Iolyn near Ysbyty Ifan, the chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey. His grandfather Rhys Fawr ap Maredudd had fought at Bosworth with Henry VII. Ellis studied at St Nicholas Hostel, Cambridge and was awarded BCL in 1533 and DCL in 1534 and from the red gown of his degree was known as ‚ÄòY Doctor Coch‚Äô (‚ÄòThe Red Doctor‚Äô). In 1535 he was appointed visitor of monasteries in Wales by Thomas Cromwell and played a leading role in their subsequent destruction. There were complaints about his immorality and arrogance and he was dismissed. In 1538 he became chancellor and commissary-general of the Diocese of St Asaph and sinecure rector of Llangwm, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos and Llanuwchllyn. At about this time he was sued in Chancery by the vicar of Llanarmon, Denbighshire, who complained that Price aided and abetted in the misappropriation of tithes; he also took part in an assault upon the Welsh scholar and translator of the New Testament into Welsh, William Salesbury of Llanrwst, Denbighshire, who was his brother-in-law. He was a Justice of the Peace for Merioneth in 1543 and from 1555 to his death, for Denbighshire from 1555 to his death, for Caernarvonshire from 1561 to his death, for Anglesey and Montgomeryshire in 1564, and for most Welsh counties by 1575. He was appointed High Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1548‚Äì49, 1556‚Äì57, 1568‚Äì69 and 1572‚Äì73 and High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1551‚Äì52, 1555‚Äì56, 1563‚Äì64, 1567‚Äì68, 1573‚Äì74, 1578‚Äì79 and 1583‚Äì84. In the intervening years he also served as High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire (1558‚Äì59) and High Sheriff of Anglesey (1577‚Äì78 and 1585‚Äì86). He was elected MP for Merioneth in 1558 and 1563. Other offices included Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire from 1558/59 to 1577 or later, member of the Council in the Marches of Wales from 1560 to his death, and Master in Chancery extraordinary. In 1560, the Crown awarded him the manor of Tir Ifan, with lands at Ysbyty Ifan and Penmachno. When Queen Elizabeth gave the lordship of Denbigh as a gift to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1564, Price, as steward of the estates, carried out acts of oppression in the area. He was on the commission granted by Elizabeth to hold the Eisteddfod at Caerwys in 1567. He married twice: firstly to Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Conway of Bodrhyddan, Flintshire, who bore him a son; and secondly to Ellyw, the daughter of Owain Pool, rector of Llandecwyn, Merioneth, who delivered two further sons and four daughters.

Topics like social justice and the human value in environmental conservation prevail in this region. As a consequence of the strong influence from Joan Martinez Alier's \\"environmentalism of the poor or social environmentalism\\", major attention is given to ecological-distributive conflicts. Alier insists that in the South a struggle exists against these conflicts generated by economic growth, mainly by the North. These endeavors \\"attempt to preserve the access of the communities to natural resources and services.\\" Mart√≠nez Alier J. (1998), Ecological economics as human economics, Fundaci√≥n C√©sar Manrique, Lanzarote (Canary Islands). On top of the negative effects on the environment by economic distribution, the cultural influence is also widely debated. For instance, the anthropologist Arturo Escobar suggests that culturally-driven preferences are one of the main factors degrading the environment. For example, society naturally gives privilege to the capitalist model that distributes natural resources with the purposes of production and profit, instead of endorsing the agroforestal ecosystem model, which is less harmful to the environment.Escobar A. (1999), ‚ÄúAn Ecology of Difference: Equality and Conflict in a Glocalized World‚Äù, in: Arizpe, L. (ed) World Culture Report II, Unesco, Paris.

History After the second biennial meeting of the International Society for Ecological Economics in 1994 at San Jos√©, Costa Rica, several professionals in the region became interested in creating a branch of this organization in their own countries to respond to the increasing development and worsening of social-environmental conflicts by the conventional-economics-based policies. However, it wasn't until 2008 that the efforts of the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Guatemala, the International Center for Political Economy at the National University of Costa Rica, and the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico resulted in the Ecological Economics Forum, May 26 and 27 2008 at Guatemala City, with the participation of zealous youth, students, and 50 professionals of Mesoamerica. Highly-recognized experts spoke, such as Alejandro Nadal, Coordinator of the working group on the Environment, Macroeconomics, Trade and Investments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); David Barkin and Roberto Constantino from the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico; Eduardo Garc√≠a Frapolli from the Center for Ecosystem Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico; Bernardo Aguilar of Prescott College, AZ, U.S. and Executive Director of the Fundacion Neotropica in Costa Rica; Miguel Mart√≠nez of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF Guatemala), and Juan Pablo Casta√±eda World Bank WAVES and GPS programs. This meeting undertook the writing of the organization's Constitution and the election of the first Board of Directors. Under the lead of the first President, M. Sc. Iliana Monterroso of Guatemala, the consolidation of the legal inscription and statutes took place.Mensaje de la Presidencia , Bernardo Aguilar (2013), accessed: July 18th, 2013. According to the Forum's participants, the main objectives of the SMEE are to create an open field for discussion of the methodological and theoretical development of Ecological economics, to promote interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary scientific research, and to support academic initiatives related to this thematic in the region. In 2010, the First International (and Biennial) Conference of the SMEE was celebrated at the Ecological Park of Xochimilco, Mexico City, from November 22 to the 26th. Very influential speakers such as Fander Falcon√≠; David Barkin; Mario P√©rez, and Carlos Mu√±√≥z Pi√±a lectured about and discussed the Ecological economics platform for the advancement of social justice, environmental justice, and the principles of sustainability. Since then, the new Board of Directors has had to deal with a shortage of memberships and the last financial crisis; but despite these challenges, it has achieved important progress in creating its website and completing several ecological economics studies and projects with the Fundacion Neotropica. Furthermore, the organization foresees the inauguration of a professional Master's program on ecological economics and political ecology at the University for International Cooperation and the proceeding of the 2014 EcoEco Alternatives Biennial Conference. Boards of Directors The Board of Directors rotates every two years and is usually elected around the biennial conference. The next election will take place in March, 2014.

The band name is rumored to be derived from a cross between the words \\"Europe\\" and \\"America\\". History Eumeria began as a solo project by Bobby Williamson (Outworld and Thought Chamber), who had planned to hire various singers and musicians to create an album. After Williamson heard the initial demo tracks laid down by Jonny Tatum (Timefall) and Reece Fullwood however, he realized that something more important was about to be born. Williamson, along with Tatum and Fullwood, agreed to scratch the project idea and move forward as a fully operational band with dedicated members. Shawn Kascak, former Outworld bandmate of Williamson's, was selected to play bass guitar, while Adam Sagan, formerly of Into Eternity, was picked to be the drummer. The recordings for the debut album began at Origin Sound studio in Texas; but Williamson, Tatum and Fullwood felt that Sagan's drumming style wasn't a perfect match for the material. The decision was made to find the right drummer for the band and replace the drum tracks. Kevin Bartlett (Anubis), a local friend of Fullwood's, was selected for the position. In 2010 Bartlett began recording new drum tracks at The Smash Room studio in Telford, England. Around this time Kascak injured his right hand and was only able to record bass guitar on two tracks. Eumeria subsequently hired Derek Blakley (Haji's Kitchen) and Michael Millsap (Six Minute Century) to step in and assist with the bass guitar duties until Kascak's hand healed. 2011 saw the unveiling of Eumeria's debut album Rebel Mind (mixed & mastered by Jacob Hansen). Although the band had several record deal offers, they chose to take a more independent approach to market and distribute their music via the latest digital technologies available on the internet. The physical album (CD) was distributed by their own record label, Rebel Tide Entertainment, which included licensing deals through Century Media for the USA and Code 7/Plastic Head for the UK and Europe. In December 2013 Eumeria was invited by former Dream Theater drummer, Mike Portnoy, to perform at the Progressive Nation at Sea Festival in February 2014. Other acts on the bill included Pain of Salvation, Periphery, Haken, Animals as Leaders, Transatlantic, King's X, Devin Townsend Project, Jon Anderson (of Yes), Tony Harnell & Bumblefoot, amongst others. On February 24, 2014 Eumeria made the announcement that Derek Blakley (Haji's Kitchen and Thought Chamber) had become the new bass player in the band, replacing Shawn Kascak. In July 2014 American Keyboardist Matt Guillory (James LaBrie, MullMuzzler, Dali's Dilemma) joined the band, replacing Bobby Williamson (who decided to step down for health reasons). Though progress has been slow, Eumeria are currently in pre-production for their sophomore album, which is due for release in 2020. Two new demos, Open Ground and 7 Hours To Nowhere, were released on their official YouTube channel in March 2016 and February 2018 respectively. Sound, style and influences Eumeria has been described as a Progressive Metal band, which fits with some of their self-proclaimed influences in writing such as Dream Theater, Opeth, Megadeth, Pantera and Queen.

The Vollmer rifles were chambered in an intermediate cartridge that was co-developed with Gustav Genschow and Co. (GECO) starting in 1934, under a Heereswaffenamt contract. Design The M 35 was a gas- operated design, reminiscent of an earlier semi-automatic design of Vollmer‚Äîthe 7.92√ó57mm Selbstladegewehr 29 (SG 29). Trials with Vollmer's Maschinenkarabine were conducted as early as 1935 at Biberach and later at Kummersdorf. The early version had a 20-round detachable box magazine and could fire at a rate of about 1,000 rpm. Development continued with the improved versions M 35A, M 35/II (1937) and M 35/III through 1938. The later versions had intentionally reduced rate of fire to only about 300‚Äì400rpm. It weighed about and was about long. About 25 prototypes were manufactured for testing. The gun was apparently very expensive to manufacture, costing apparently 4000 Reichsmarks, although this was the unit cost for the prototype series.O.

Ultimately, Nazi Germany would adopt a different intermediate cartridge and service assault rifle: the MKb 42 series leading to the Sturmgewehr 44. The later Soviet 7.62√ó39mm M43 cartridge bore more dimensional similarity to the GECO M 35 cartridge than it did to the German 7.92√ó33mm Kurz that was used in the Sturmgewehr.

It examines anti-Black stereotypes that permeated popular culture from the ante- bellum period until the advent of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Content Ethnic Notions takes viewers on a disturbing voyage through American history, tracing for the deep-rooted stereotypes which have fueled anti-Black prejudice. Through these images we can begin to understand the evolution of racial consciousness in the United States. Ethnic Notions exposes and describes common stereotypes (The Tom, The Sambo, The Mammy, The Coon, The Brute, The Pickaninnies, The Minstrels) from the period surrounding the Civil War and the World Wars. The stereotypes roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs, minstrel shows, advertisements, folklore, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. Narration by Esther Rolle and commentary by respected scholars [Barbara Christian, UC Berkeley; Pat Turner, University of Massachusetts, Boston; George Fredrickson, Stanford University; Leni Sloan: choreographer; Carlton Moss: University of California, Irvine] shed light on the origins and devastating consequences of 150 years of these dehumanizing caricatures. Widely influenced by Jim Crow, a dance to depict black people which was widely televised, people in small towns who never seen black people were easily influenced Jim Crow = dancing black carefree Sambo on television a plantation was depicted as a happy paradise Sambo is a happy black in their proper place. The documentary touches upon issues of servility, sexuality, appearances, the \\"noble\\" savage, and most evidently the impact of mass media on the image of the African Americans‚Äîespecially the exaggerated physical image of a very dark person, with very bright large lips, very white eyes and large unkempt hair‚Äîand how this affects the self-image of the African American. The insidious images exacted a devastating toll on Black Americans and continue to undermine race relations. Reception Ethnic Notions has become a mainstay of university, high school, and public library collections and the most widely seen of Marlon Riggs‚Äô work. It won an Emmy Award in 1988.

MRAP2 is a transmembrane accessory protein to a family of five receptors called the melanocortin receptors (MC1-5). Human genome sequencing analysis led to the discovery of MRAP2, Human MRAP2 gene is located in chromosome 6q14.3, a different chromosomal location from that of human MRAP which is a paralogy to MRAP2. MRAP2 is thought to be involved in regulating the expression of the melanocortin (MC1-5) and some non- melanocortin receptors such as ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a), orexin (OX1R) receptor and prokineticin receptor (PKR-1). MRAP2 was found first in the adrenal gland and the brain. However, the Human protein Atlas/ RNA-seq analysis data of human genome detected MRAP2 in other tissues such as ovary, endometrium, testis, digestive tract, pituitary gland and skin. The MRAP2 function was found to be associated with regulating appetite and energy expenditure. This is through regulating different receptors involved in the brain circuit regulating those two functions. Such receptors include MC4, MC3, GHSR-1a, PKR-1 and OX1R.  Structure and functional regions  The MRAP2 gene is located in chromosome 6q14.3 and is composed of 4 exons with the first exon containing a non-coding sequence. The translated MRAP2 protein is a 205 amino acids single-pass transmembrane protein. The amino- (N-) terminal and the transmembrane domain were found to show a 40% similarity between MRAP2 and MRAP, while the Carboxyl- (C-) terminal is found to be different between the two proteins. The different domains of MRAP2 were found to have different functions. The C-terminal was found essential for the inhibition of the activity of certain receptors (OX1R and PKR-1). Different sequences of the N- terminal have two separate function with the 23-33 amino sequence being responsible for the surface expression of OX1R, while the 34-43 sequence was found to have a negative auto-regulatory role over MRAP2 function. MRAP2 is located both on the cell membrane and also sub-cellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The MRAP2 shares a unique feature with MRAP as both were found to show a dual topology orientation. Immunofluorescence imaging and live cell imaging studies showed the both the C- terminal and the N-terminal expressed on the cell membrane and in the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The Dual orientation feature enables the formation of homodimers (MRAP2/MRAP2) and heterodimer (MRAP2/MRAP). Post-translational processing of MRAP2 protein includes the N-linked glycosylation which plays an important factor in MRAP2 enabling MC2 stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Phylogenetic studies had located MRAP2 gene in different species such as mammals, chickens, piscine species (tetrapod and zebrafish), bony fish subspecies, sea lamprey and cartilaginous fish. The detection of MRAP2 in the last two species suggested that MRAP2 as an ancestral role by giving rise to MRAP through gene duplication as MRAP was absent in those two species. but this claim was dismissed upon locating MRAP cDNA in elephant sharks.  Cellular activity  The distribution of MRAP2 in the brain within the appetite control and weight control regions revealed its involvement in those two regulatory circuits. MRAP2 was found regulate the expression and response of MC4, and MC3. MC4 role has a well described in appetite control in the brain. MC4 is mediating an anorexic effect in the hypothalamus. MRAP2 was found in high levels in brain regions that is associated with feeding behaviour such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. MRAP2/MC4 double knockout transgenic mice were found morbidly obese. Also, the treatment of MC4/MRAP2 transfected cells with the melanocortin ligand alpha -melanocyte stimulating hormone (Œ±-MSH) generated a response (increased cAMP production). Similar response was seen in MC3/MRAP2 transfected cells which indicate an interaction of MRAP2 with the two anorexic receptors in the brain. Unlike MRAP, MRAP2 interacts with other GPCRs that does not belong to the melanocortin receptors family. The common factor between all of the receptors under the regulation of MRAP2 is that they are all involved in controlling appetite and energy expenditure. The receptors that were found to be regulated by MRAP2 until now are the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a); prokineticin receptor (PKR-1); and orexin receptor (OX1R). While MRAP2 was stimulates feeding by increasing the expression and activity of GHSR-1, MRAP2 was also found to stimulate feeding by suppressing PKR-1 activity. In contrast to this positive effect on feeding behaviour, MRAP2 was found also to suppress appetite by down-regulating the expression of orexigenic receptor OX1R. The two opposite effects of MRAP2 on feeding behaviour might indicate that this accessory protein is regulating most of the key receptors involved in appetite control. MRAP2 is found in the adrenal gland where MRAP is known to regulate MC2 surface expression and function. In vivo studies had revealed MRAP2 to interact with MC2 leading to an increase in the receptor surface expression as well as enhancing the response of the receptor to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation. However, MC2 stimulation by ACTH is more potent in the presence of MRAP compared to MRAP2. MRAP2 was also, found expressed in the developing adrenals and is considered to assist in the differentiation of the gland and its zonation.  Obesity  Screening the MRAP2 coding region and the intron-exon boundaries of the MRAP2 gene sequence had initially identified four genetic variants and only one generated a disrupted MRAP2 protein. The other three variants were located in the C-terminal which led to the belief that these mutations were not disrupting the translated MRAP2 protein. A mutational sequencing analyses of the coding region of MRAP2 had identified eight more genetic variants of MRAP2, all of which were found in unrelated extremely obese individuals and none was found in the control group. The detected MRAP2 variants were found to be heterozygotic and were found to be rare in the studied population. The identified MRAP2 eight variants were either: intronic, synonymous, non-synonymous, and coding. Studying the effect of those variants on MC4 signalling revealed only the non-synonymous MRAP2 variant to cause a diminished MC4 signalling activity. Most of the identified mutations were detected in obese individuals with no obesity-related symptoms and those mutations. MRAP2 knockout mice models revealed the obesity phenotype of those models to be different from the phenotype caused by MC4 knockout models that might be due to MRAPs interactions with other appetite and energy homeostasis mediators. Even with the detection of the different MRAP2 genetic variants in extremely obese individuals, the underlying mechanism by which these mutations cause obesity is not clearly understood. This could be attributed to the involvement of MRAP2 in the regulation of different orexigenic and anorectic receptors expression and signaling. The MRAP2 targeted deletion in the different regions of the appetite control circuit could provide more insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity caused by MRAP2 variants. Uncovering MRAP2 interactions with the melanocortin receptors and other GPCRs is yet to be completed to understand the exact mechanism of regulatory action of this unique accessory protein. The widespread MRAP2 distribution outside the feeding and weight control circuits could indicate a role for MRAP2 that extends beyond its currently described role and might also unveil its association with different pathophysiological conditions.

It is created by pouring an amount of whisky into a saucepan. It is then set alight, in order to make sure that the sauce is not too bitter. Double cream is added whilst stirring. The heat is then reduced so that the sauce can thicken and finally seasoning such as salt and pepper is added. Despite the fact that various types of alcohol have been used to make sauces for centuries, the lack of documentation of whisky sauce would seem to indicate that it is a relatively modern invention. However the documentation of whisky in savoury cooking goes back to at least Victorian times, where its use in meals is documented in Isabella Beeton's famous cookery book Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. In recent times, Whisky sauce and barbeque sauces have been combined, in order to create whisky barbeque sauces such as those by Jim Beam and Jack Daniel's.

It is the second largest in physical size of any known viral genus. Pandoraviruses have double stranded DNA genomes, with the largest genome size (2.5 million base pairs) of any known viral genus.  Discovery  The discovery of Pandoraviruses by a team of French scientists led by husband and wife team Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel, was announced in a report in the journal Science in July 2013. Other scientists had previously observed the pandoravirus particles, but owing to their enormous size they were not expected to be viruses. Patrick Scheid, a parasitologist from the Central Institute of the Bundeswehr Medical Service in Koblenz, Germany, found one in 2008, in an amoeba living in the contact lens of a woman with keratitis. Its development within the amoebal host was documented extensively. Unlike in other cases with such giant viruses, the large particles within Acanthamoebae were not mistaken for bacteria. The authors initially termed them \\"endocytobionts\\". Mimivirus, a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus with a genome size of about 1.1 megabases, was described in 1992 but not recognized as a virus until 2003. Megavirus, discovered in seawater off the coast of Chile in 2011, has a genome size of approximately 1.2 megabases. The prior discovery of these viruses prompted a search for other types of large amoeba-infecting viruses, which led to the finding of two species; Pandoravirus salinus, found in seawater taken from the coast of Chile, with a genome size of ~2.5 megabases, and Pandoravirus dulcis, found in a shallow freshwater pond in La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia, with a 1.9 megabase genome.  Description  Pandoraviruses are oval in shape and are about 1 micrometer (1000 nanometers) in length. Other viruses range from 50 to 100 nanometers. In addition to being large physically, Pandoraviruses have a large genome made up of 2,500 genes, compared to only 10 genes on average in other viruses. For example, the Influenza A virus contains 7 genes and HIV contains only 9 genes. Gene content varies among species of Pandoravirus, with Pandoravirus salinus, containing 2,500 genes and Pandoravirus dulcis containing about 1,500 genes. Pandoraviruses were originally mistaken for bacteria, however, they are missing some of the distinct features of bacteria such as the ability to make their own proteins. The dissimilarity of the remaining genes to any cellular genes led researchers to speculate that this virus may represent a previously unknown branch of the tree of life. However, experts not involved in the study have called that suggestion premature because there is very little evidence supporting the idea.  Replication  Pandoraviruses have double stranded DNA. Like most giant viruses, Pandoraviruses have a viral life cycle. They lack the ability to make their own proteins, rely on the host cells for ATP (energy) and reproduction and also do not contain ribosomes or produce energy to divide. Under the microscope, scientists observed the virus enter the amoeba through fusion with membrane vacuoles, and integrate their DNA into the host cells. The host cell replicates the viral particles and eventually splits open releasing the viral particles. The process of replication cycle lasts 10‚Äì15 hours. Viral replication and assembly happens simultaneously. In other words, viral DNA is replicated within the cytoplasm of the host cell and assembled into new viral particles followed by lysis of the host cell.  Prevalence in the environment  Pandoraviruses do not seem to be harmful to humans. They are mostly found in marine environments, infecting amoebae. One reason for their only relatively recent discovery is because they exist in environments that are not well studied. Pandoraviruses, like other marine viruses, prey on plankton, which are organisms that live in the water column and form the basis of the food chain for other marine species. More study and research needs to be done in order to confirm the prevalence of Pandoraviruses in different environments. Currently, not much is known about their role in marine ecosystems.  Phylogenetic affinities  Approximately 93% of Pandoravirus genes are not known from any other microbes, suggesting they may belong to an as of yet undescribed \\"fourth domain\\" aside from Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. Viruses as a whole are not popularly considered to be located within these three domains, although they have been proposed as one in the past by some biologists.  Comparison with other giant viruses  Other giant viruses such as the Mimivirus, Pithovirus and Megavirus, have much smaller genomes. For example, Mimivirus, considered one of the largest giant viruses, has a genome size of 1.1 million base pairs compared to 2.5 million base pairs for Pandoraviruses. Another feature that is different in Pandoraviruses compared to other giant viruses is the replication cycle. Pandoraviruses infect amoebas, which are single celled eukaryotes. Pandoravirus enters amoebas through phagocytic vacuoles, then fuses with the membrane vacuole of the amoeba. This leads to viral particles to be released into the cytoplasm of the amoeba.

EINER BOBERG was a Danish-Canadian speech pathologist who specialized in the study of stuttering and its treatment. From 1971 to 1995, he was a Professor of Speech Pathology in the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton Canada. In 1986, together with Deborah Kully, he founded the Institute for Stuttering Treatment and Research (ISTAR).\\"We Day makes impression at local school\\" . St. Albert Gazette. Apr 13, 2013, by: Scott Hayes He was particularly known for his advocacy of post-treatment maintenance of fluency, including the benefits of self-help groups. In 1991, he became the first President of the International Fluency Association. Early life Boberg was born Ejnar Bidstrup Bovbjerg, the son of Danish immigrant parents, S√∏ren Bovbjerg and Ellen Bidstrup, in Dalum, Alberta, a farming community near Drumheller, Alberta, in 1935.https://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/pioneers/boberg/shamez.html He was himself a severe stutterer. As a young man he intended to become a violinist and enrolled in the music program at St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minnesota, but had to return to Alberta without a degree when his father died in 1959. He then went to Vienna, Austria, to continue his violin studies, where he met his wife, Julia Sluce; they were married in England in 1960. Traumatized by his inability to speak with his in-laws, he sought stuttering therapy in London and redirected his future plans toward helping others afflicted by stuttering. He enrolled in a Master's program in Speech Pathology at the University of Iowa, where he studied with Wendell Johnson, and then a Ph.D. in Speech Pathology at the University of Minnesota. Professional contributions Throughout his career, Boberg researched, wrote and made presentations about the causes of and treatments for stuttering. Boberg's work at the University of Alberta and at ISTAR focused on the development of treatment programs for both children and adults based on principles of behavior modification and operant conditioning, and particularly on the work of Charles Van Riper. Clients were first given intensive therapy over a period of weeks, which was designed to minimize disfluencies and associated behaviors through the learning of fluency skills. They were then directed to practice their skills outside the clinic, in order to overcome social anxieties associated with stuttering; to return periodically for refresher clinics; and to participate in self-help groups, in which fellow stutterers could share experiences and work on fluency maintenance in a supportive environment. Boberg and colleague Deborah Kully conducted a long-term study of clinical outcomes which supported the effectiveness of this approach. The clinical program implemented at ISTAR was set forth in several publications, including Maintenance of Fluency in 1981 and Comprehensive Stuttering Program in 1985.Jaan Pill. \\"Einer Boberg's Contribution to the Self-Help Movement\\". Toward the end of his career, Boberg became interested in the neuropsychological basis of stuttering and its implications for treatmentBoberg, Einer (ed). 1993. The Neuropsychology of Stuttering. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press. Personal life Despite having given up music as a career, Boberg maintained a lifelong interest in it, playing chamber music with friends, serving as President of the Edmonton Youth Orchestra and singing, with his wife, in Edmonton's Richard Eaton Singers He died in 1995 in Edmonton, after a short battle with cancer.

Published monthly by Endeavor Business Media, it is the leading US magazine for environmental, health and safety management professionals in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. History EHS Today was first published in 1938 as Occupational Hazards and Safety by Irving B. Hexter. Hexter, a Cleveland native and noted philanthropist, was a graduate of the University of Michigan. He began his business career as president of his brother's clothing business, the Morreau Hexter Co. He subsequently established his own greeting card company and in 1930 founded the Industrial Publishing Co. (IPC). The first magazine he published was a monthly periodical titled Here's How Its Welded (now called Welding Design & Fabrication.) By 1960 IPC was the 5th largest trade paper publisher in the United States, producing 13 publications with an aggregate monthly circulation of 510,000, and an annual gross advertising volume of US$5 million. Launching the first issue, Hexter wrote: \\"Each stride of modern industry towards faster, better manufacture of old products, or towards development of new ones, has created additional health and accident hazards\\" and the magazine set out to raise awareness of the safety and health hazards - and the resulting loss of productivity - resulting from the implementation of the latest industrial processes. The name of the magazine was subsequently truncated to Occupational Hazards. Following Hexter's death, IPC merged with Penton Publishing Co. to form Penton/IPC. In April 1998, the company changed its name to Penton Media. Penton continued publication of Occupational Hazards until 2008, when the title was rebranded as EHS Today. Sandy Smith, editor-in-chief, explained: \\"EHS Today was created for the EHS manager of the 21st century - one who can't be satisfied with an information silo but needs a comprehensive source of news and knowledge that is easily accessible in print or online. EHS Today builds on Occupational Hazards' 70-year tradition of editorial excellence, but redefines the mission to serve today's multi-tasking, technologically savvy reader operating in a global economy. It's a 'clean sheet' magazine built on more than seven decades of intimate experience with the EHS profession.\\" In 2016, Penton was acquired by Informa. In 2019, Informa sold its manufacturing division, including EHS Today, to Endeavor Business Media.

New York: Schirmer, 2001. Biography In Context. Web. 18 July 2013. was an American opera coloratura soprano. In 1926, she was the youngest prima donna to have made a debut at the Metropolitan Opera, but her swift rise to fame was followed by a relatively quick return to obscurity. Early life Marion Nevada TalleyTalley Marion Obituary: Encyclopedia.com https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/talley-marion-1906-1983 was born in Nevada, Missouri, the daughter of Charles Marion Talley, a telegraph operator for Missouri Pacific Railroad, and Helen H. (Brown) Talley.Talley Marion Obituary: Encyclopedia.com https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/talley-marion-1906-1983 She grew up in Kansas City, Missouri after her father was transferred there when she was a baby. At an early age she was taking piano, violin, and voice lessons, singing with church choirs, and growing a reputation among local music critics and audiences. At the age of fifteen, Talley appeared in a 1922 Kansas City Grand Opera Company production of Mignon by Ambroise Thomas, and was a local sensation. Her career became a cause c√©l√®bre for the citizens of Kansas City, who attended benefit concerts and contributed money for her to study in New York, under the famed teacher Frank LaForge, and later in Italy. She unsuccessfully auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera in 1923. Career The Metropolitan Opera's general manager, Giulio Gatti-Casazza, hired Talley for the 1925/26 season. On February 17, 1926, she made her debut there as Gilda, the daughter of the title character in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto. At the age of nineteen, she was the youngest prima donna to sing at the Metropolitan Opera at that time. (Patrice Munsel would perform there at age eighteen in 1943.) Her pending debut caused a media sensation, contrary to Gatti-Casazza's hopes that it would remain low-key. A delegation of two hundred leading citizens of Kansas City, including Mayor Albert I. Beach, arrived via a special train. Tickets were being resold at astronomical prices. A telegraph was set up backstage so her father could send dispatches to the Associated Press. Her performance prompted multiple ovations from the crowd, but critics were less enthusiastic. While they thought her debut promising, it did not live up to the expectations caused by the media frenzy. That year featured two other Talley debuts. Two days later, she made her radio debut singing \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" She also appeared in the first publicly exhibited shorts featuring the Vitaphone sound film, which premiered on Broadway on August 6, along with the first Vitaphone feature-length film, Don Juan starring John Barrymore. The short films preceding the feature were a collection of musical performances featuring Talley along with a number of other classical and opera musicians including Henry Hadley conducting the New York Philharmonic, Mischa Elman, Josef Bonime, Efrem Zimbalist, Harold Bauer, Giovanni Martinelli, and Anna Case and Hawaiian guitarist Roy Smeck. Talley performed \\"Caro nome\\" from Rigoletto. Negative reviews of the Vitaphone premiere focused mainly on Talley, criticizing her inexperience as a performer and her lack of photogenic qualities. In 1927, she would appear in another Vitaphone short film, performing \\"Bella figlia dell'amore\\", the quartet from Rigoletto. along with Jeanne Gordon, Beniamino Gigli, and Giuseppe de Luca. Talley spent four seasons with the Metropolitan Opera and appeared in only seven productions, for a total of eighty-four performances. Her roles included the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the title character in Lucia di Lammermoor by Gaetano Donizetti, and the title character in Le Rossignol by Igor Stravinsky. Her contract was not renewed for the 1929 season. Later life and marriages Talley claimed that she would retire to a farm in Kansas, but she attempted to resurrect her career in several ways. She went on concert tours and spent some time at the Chicago Opera. From 1936-1938, she had her own program on NBC Radio. It was sponsored by Ry-Krisp and she appeared in many of their advertisements. She moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in motion pictures, but she starred in only one film, Follow Your Heart (1936), a musical from Republic Pictures. Soon she permanently retired from show business. Talley was married twice. In 1932, she married German pianist Michael Raucheisen, but the marriage was annulled after a few months.Marion Talley Given Divorce: The annulment was granted last night in superior court here on the singer's charge that her husband had violated a pre-nuptial agreement by refusing Ms. Talley's mother and sister to live with them The St. Petersburg Times 30 January 1933 https://www.newspapers.com/image/315707101/?terms=%22Marion%2BTalley%22 In 1935, she married music critic and voice teacher Adolf Eckstrom.Marion Talley Gets Custody Of Child: The father Adolph G.

He was also a trained agronomist who at the time of his death was a professor of mathematics at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras. In June 2013 he was kidnapped and murdered in San Pedro Sula,Honduras: Mutilated body in San Pedro Sula identified as journalist Anibal Barrow with the newspaper La Prensa described Barrow's murder as ‚Äúthe most ruthless crime against a communicator (journalist) in the annals of Honduran history.‚Äù He was the 36th journalist in Honduras to have been killed in a decade, and the 26th to have been killed since the June 2009 coup d‚Äô√©tat. Early life and education Barrow's parents separated when he was six or eight years old. He attended primary and secondary school in Omoa, where he lived with his paternal grandfather, finishing secondary school in Tegucigalpa. He then studied at the Regional University Center of the Atlantic Coast (CURLA), where he received a degree in agronomical engineering. He also earned a degree in journalism at CURN (the Northern Regional University Center), now the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras, in the Valle de Sula). While he was a student at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras he was an active member of the United University Democratic Front (Frente Unido Universitario Democr√°tico, FUUD), and was in charge of logistical coordination and public relations for that group. Career =Journalism= In La Ceiba, Barrow worked in the radio. He then moved to San Pedro Sula, where he began working in journalism. From 1992 to 1996, according to one source, he worked at Vica TV on ‚ÄúStarting Early‚Äù (Desde Temprano), an early- morning news program that was broadcast on national television. (Another account of his career states that Barrow worked on ‚ÄúStarting Early‚Äù until 2010.) After leaving Vica, Barrow began broadcasting his own program, ‚ÄúAn√≠bal Barrow and Nothing More‚Äù (An√≠bal Barrow y Nada M√°s) on channel 42 of Hondured Television. At first it was broadcast on weekdays between 4 and 8 am. Later it was shortened to an hour. News reports dating to 2009 indicate that as of that year, Barrow was associated with Hondured. In July 2009, at the time of the Honduran coup, he and three other journalists, Patricia Arias of Canal 8, Allan McDonald of the El Heraldo, and Esdras Amado L√≥pez, owner of the Canal 36 television station, were feared missing, but it turned out that they, along with other journalists, had ‚Äúdecided to lay low because of the ongoing political crisis.‚Äù Contemporaneous reports on this matter identified Barrow as an associate of Hondured. Barrow's own Facebook postings indicate that as of 2011 was the moderator of a regular evening program called ‚ÄúTheories and Realities‚Äù on Hondored and was also the host of the morning talk and commentary series, ‚ÄúAn√≠bal and Nothing More,‚Äù which at that point was airing from 6 to 8 am on both Hondured and TVH. By the time of his death Barrow had moved to Globo TV, taking with him the morning talk show, ‚ÄúAn√≠bal and Nothing More,‚Äù that he had previously hosted on Hondured. It aired on Globo TV on weekdays from 5:30 to 7:30 am. On the program he mostly commented on current events but did not engage in investigative journalism. At the time of his death he was also regularly hosting a radio program on Radio Norte, ‚ÄúTwo to Eleven,‚Äù (Dos a las once) with his colleague Jorge Oseguera. They had been working together on the program since 2011. Ricardo Mencia, Barrow's producer at Vica and later at Hondured, said that working with him was ‚Äúvery special‚Äù and turned Mencia into a professional in all areas of life.‚Äù Mencia described Barrow as ‚Äúa kind and caring person who takes out his very heart to give it to others.‚Äù Mencia said that ‚ÄúAn√≠bal and Nothing More‚Äù became a program that was ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù because Barrow ‚Äújokes and chats with the people without denying anyone their right to freedom of expression, even if they are not at the moment in accord with the views of the general public.‚Äù Mencia praised Barrow's combination of ‚Äújoviality and traditionalism‚Äù and noted that for a time he always had with him on the television program a pair of maracas, which he played on the air while saying the nonsense words ‚Äúnaca naca pirinaca, ni fu ni fa, machaca chu, sunga tunga marunga tanga,‚Äù which became famous in Honduras. Whenever asked what these words meant, Barrow said only that it was ‚Äúall part of the show.‚Äù Another famous feature of the show was a toy rooster that emitted a bizarre crowing sound, the conceit being that the rooster was there to awaken the viewers of the early-morning show. David Fernando Torres, also a former media colleague, said that Barrow had taught him responsibility and punctuality. After Barrow's death, his friend Jos√© Israel Navarro Carrasco, an Air Force colonel, under the headline ‚ÄúNaca Naca Pirinaca,‚Äù recalled that Barrow had begun every morning's edition of ‚ÄúAnibal and Nothing More‚Äù by making drumming gestures and reciting that nonsense phrase. Navarro described him as a man who was ‚Äúalways jovial, analytical, and combative‚Äù and who always ‚Äúspoke the truth to everyone.‚Äù Navarro wrote that he had never heard Barrow ‚Äúrail against his political opponents,‚Äù and memorialized him as a ‚Äúsoldier hero who has fallen in the daily combat for information....The voice and the pen will never be silenced, someone will always pick up the flag.‚Äù =Academic career= In addition to his journalistic work, Barrow was a longtime professor of mathematics. He began working as an educator at the University Center of the Atlantic Coast (CURLA) in the 1980s. In 1996 he transferred to the Department of Mathematics at UNAH-VS, where he taught a class in quantitative methods from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. After his disappearance, his students remembered him as an exemplary professor who always brought them coffee and doughnuts on Mondays. A former student who had since moved to the U.S. recalled that Barrow never grew frustrated or arrogant if students did not understand a math problem, and would patiently explain it twenty times if necessary. The chairman of the Mathematics Department at UNAH- VS, Raul Alvarado, described Barrow as ‚Äúextremely responsible‚Äù and praised his dedication and collaborative spirit. Others called him a man of high principle and character. Other activities During the administrations of Carlos Roberto Reina (1994-1998) and Carlos Roberto Flores (1998-2002), Barrow served as regional director of the Institute for Professional Training (Instituto de Formaci√≥n Profesional, INFOP). Views Barrow was a Catholic and a member of the Liberal Party. ‚ÄúIdeologies distract us like a circus,‚Äù he wrote on Facebook in 2011. ‚ÄúJournalists should contribute with the truth and leave the media show aside.‚Äù He also wrote: ‚ÄúHonduras cannot keep having empty conversations; there is a great deal of poverty and we need to find solutions, rich and poor.‚Äù Libel lawsuit Barrow was convicted of libel in 2006 in a lawsuit brought by another journalist, Roxana Guevara. He was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for saying, on programs broadcast on December 21 and 26, 2001, that Guevara had stolen videos of Hurricane Mitch that were part of reports for which Guevara had won a prize. Kidnapping and murder Barrow was kidnapped on June 24, 2013, on the outskirts of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, while traveling in a car with a driver and members of his family. At the time of the abduction, his blue Honda CRV was reportedly sitting still in traffic that was caused by an accident. Authorities said that he was abducted by at least ten armed assailants who had been seen in a white Mitsubishi without license plates. One source reported that three family members were abducted with him but were released unharmed; another source said he was travelling at the time with his daughter-in-law and grandson, in addition to a driver, and that these three persons were taken with him but released unharmed. Barrow's captors drove him to Las Ca√±eras, an area in the Department of Cortes between San Pedro Sula and the municipality of San Manuel. No ransom request was ever made. Later the same day, Barrow's vehicle was found behind a sugar-cane refinery in Las Ca√±eras. There was a bullet hole in one door and there were traces of blood inside the vehicle. One of the perpetrators, who eventually came into the custody of authorities and was held as a protected witness, told the police where Barrow's body was located, At around 9:00 on the morning of July 9, 2013, Barrow's burned and dismembered torso, from which the arms, legs, and head had been removed, was found by the Siboney lagoon in the Dos Caminos district of Villanueva, about 20 kilometers from San Pedro Sula. Authorities believed that Barrow had been killed on the day of his abduction. His head and limbs were found later on July 9. Police discovered Barrow's clothing and bankbook in the vicinity of his body. The remains were identified by means of forensic tests. The last message sent by Barrow on his mobile phone read: ‚ÄúThe truth prevails and triumphs sooner or later.‚Äù =Arrests= Four members of the Gordo criminal gang were arrested in connection with the murder on July 5. Two of them, Gustavo Armando Dur√°n Banegas (23) and Delmer Donael Dur√°n Banegas (21), were apprehended in the Altos de Santa Fe neighborhood of Dos Caminos in Villanueva. In the Brisas del Cacao neighborhood of Lomas del Carmen, Jos√© Hern√°n D√≠az Mej√≠a (44) and Ibis Laurent Lara Pereira (24) were taken into custody. As of July 9, at least four other persons were being actively sought by the police, all of them identified as material participants in the crime: H√©ctor Noel Baquedano Galindo, Heber Natanael Mendoza Contreras, Denis Omar Ram√≠rez Mart√≠nez, and an unnamed minor. The above-mentioned protected witness told police that a criminal group had been paid 400,000 lempiras (about $20,000) to kill Barrow. Some news media reported that a ‚Äúhighly placed‚Äù individual had ordered and paid for the murder. =Reactions= ‚ÄúWe express our solidarity with Barrow‚Äôs family and all Honduran journalists, who are traumatized by this barbaric crime,‚Äù Reporters Without Borders said. ‚ÄúWhile the investigation has already produced some results, the murder will remain unpunished as long as the instigators have not been identified and brought to trial.‚Äù Reporters Without Borders added: ‚ÄúIt seems highly probable that Barrow‚Äôs murder was linked to his work as a journalist.‚Äù Irina Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO, denounced the killing of Barrow. ‚ÄúI trust that the authorities will be able to bring to justice those responsible for this crime which undermines freedom of expression in Honduras and journalists‚Äô ability to exercise their profession. Letting crimes against journalists go unpunished seriously undermines press freedom.‚Äù Juan Mairena, president of the Honduran Press Association, said, ‚ÄúThis horrendous crime intimidates all Honduran journalists. We strongly urge authorities to clarify...whether or not the motive [for the crime] was his profession.‚Äù The President of Honduras, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, issued a statement condemning the murder and expressing condolences to his family, friends, and viewing audience. The UN has identified Honduras as having the highest murder rate in the world and San Pedro Sula as being the city with the world's highest murder rate. =Funeral= Barrow's funeral took place on July 11 at St. Vincent de Paul church in San Pedro Sula. He was buried in Memorial Gardens cemetery. =Investigation= It was reported on July 27 that after Barrow had started broadcasting his program on Globo TV, he had begun to receive e-mailed death threats. In addition, it was revealed that on June 24, Barrow had seemed worried and explained to a confidant that he was receiving threats, but did not go into detail about them. Another individual who provided testimony to the police said that on June 15, he had been in a restaurant in Tegucigalpa with Barrow when the latter received several threats on his cell phone. The person sending the threat had said he would come get Barrow, in response to which Barrow had told him to do so and told him the name of the restaurant at which they were eating. Yet another witness said that on June 22 Barrow had received three threatening calls, in response to the last of which Barrow had replied: ‚Äúif...you know where I am, come look for me, I'm waiting here.‚Äù It also emerged that on the morning of June 24, Barrow had received a call from a person who claimed to be a congressional candidate belonging to the Colon party, and who said he wanted to meet him. Over the course of the day, this person phoned Barrow about sixteen times. According to one witness, Barrow, who had been riding on a bus, complained that the man's frequent phone calls had prevented him from sleeping on the bus. The caller insisted that Barrow meet with him, and Barrow finally agreed, saying that he had to be at the university and would rest a little afterwards and could meet the man later in San Pedro Sula. Later that day, the man met Barrow on a dirt road near the Metropolitan Olympic Stadium, showed him a video on his camera, and gave indications that he was interested in purchasing ad time on Barrow's program. The connection between all this information and the murder was not made clear to the public. Personal life Barrow married Leda Maradiaga in 1983. They had three children: Anibal, Fernando, and Astrid. After his death they described him as very loving and supportive in every way. Barrow's son Anibal was born in 1985, attended the Instituto Experimental La Salle and UNICAH, the Catholic University of Honduras. He won a seat representing the Department of Cortes in the Honduran Congress in the November 2013 elections. Barrow was a passionate fan of the Olimpia soccer team. After Barrow's murder, his son said: ‚ÄúWe forgive the people who did this because it is not up to us to say what should happen to them.‚Äù References Category:1948 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Honduran journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Honduran television journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras faculty Category:Honduran murder victims Category:Journalists killed in Honduras ","title":"Anibal Barrow"},{"id":"40006064","text":"HFLS3 is the name for a distant galaxy, located at z = 6.34, originating about 880 million years after the Big Bang.

It is the sequel to Dragon Ball and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 1989 to January 1996, before getting dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81countries worldwide. It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise. Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell) and magical creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rival Vegeta. Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball franchise; including 15 movies, 2 TV specials, and 148 video games (many of them being only released in Japan), and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai. There have also been two sequel series, Dragon Ball GT (1996‚Äì1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015‚Äì2018).  Plot summary  Dragon Ball Z picks up five years after the end of the Dragon Ball anime, with Goku now a young adult and father to his son, Gohan. A humanoid alien named Raditz arrives on Earth in a spacecraft and tracks down Goku, revealing to him that he is his long-lost older brother and that they are members of a near-extinct extraterrestrial warrior race called the . The Saiyans had sent Goku (originally named \\"Kakarot\\") to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a traumatic brain injury soon after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his bloodthirsty Saiyan nature. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, which results in Raditz kidnapping Gohan. Goku decides to team up with his former enemy Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz and save his son, while sacrificing his own life in the process. In the afterlife, Goku trains under the ruler of the North Galaxy, King Kai, and is taught the Kaio-ken (ÁïåÁéãÊã≥) and Spirit Bomb (also known as the ) techniques, before being revived by the Dragon Balls a year later in order to save the Earth from Raditz' allies; Nappa and the self-proclaimed \\"Prince of all Saiyans\\", Vegeta, who arrive before Goku returns. Piccolo is killed by Nappa during the battle, along with Goku's allies Yamcha, Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu (with Chiaotzu sacrificing himself to save Tien), and both Kami and the Dragon Balls cease to exist as a result of Piccolo's death. After Goku finally arrives at the battlefield, he avenges his fallen friends by defeating Nappa with his new level of power. Vegeta executes Nappa for his failure and does battle with Goku, but is ultimately defeated thanks to the efforts of Gohan and Goku's other surviving allies, Krillin and Yajirobe. At Goku's request, they spare Vegeta's life and allow him to escape Earth, with Vegeta vowing to return and destroy the planet out of revenge for his humiliation at Goku's hands. During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's homeworld, . While Goku recovers from his injuries, Gohan, Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon Balls to revive their fallen friends. However, they discover that Vegeta's superior, the galactic tyrant Lord Frieza, is already there, looking to use the Dragon Balls for himself so that he can achieve immortality. A fully healed Vegeta arrives on Namek as well, also seeking immortality from the Dragon Balls, which leads to several battles between him and Frieza's henchmen. Realizing he is overpowered, Vegeta teams up with Gohan and Krillin to fight the Ginyu Force, a team of elite mercenaries summoned by Frieza. After Goku finally arrives on Namek, the epic battle with Frieza himself comes to a close when Goku transforms into the fabled of legend and defeats him before escaping Namek as the planet is destroyed in a massive explosion. Upon his return to Earth a year later, Goku encounters a time traveler named Trunks, the future son of Bulma and Vegeta, who warns Goku that two will appear three years later, seeking revenge against Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. During this time, an evil lifeform called Cell emerges and, after absorbing two of the Androids to achieve his \\"perfect form\\", holds his own fighting tournament to decide the fate of the Earth, known as the \\"Cell Games\\". After Goku sacrifices his own life a second time, to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by destroying Cell after ascending to the second level of Super Saiyan. Seven years later, Goku is revived for one day to reunite with his loved ones and meet his youngest son, Goten, at the . Soon after, Goku and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Supreme Kai against a magical being named Majin Buu summoned by the evil wizard Babidi. After numerous battles that result in the deaths of many of Goku's allies as well as the destruction of Earth, Goku (whose life is fully restored by the Elder Supreme Kai) kills Kid Buu (the original and most powerful form of Majin Buu) with a Spirit Bomb attack containing the energy of all the inhabitants of Earth, who were resurrected along with the planet by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goku makes a wish for Buu to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another Tenkaichi Bud≈çkai, he meets Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train him to become Earth's new defender.  Production and broadcasting  Kazuhiko Torishima, Akira Toriyama's editor for Dr. Slump and the first half of Dragon Ball, felt that the Dragon Ball anime's ratings were gradually declining because it had the same producer that worked on Dr. Slump. Torishima said this producer had this \\"cute and funny\\" image connected to Toriyama's work and was missing the more serious tone in the newer series, and therefore asked the studio to change the producer. Impressed with their work on Saint Seiya, he asked its director K≈çz≈ç Morishita and writer Takao Koyama to help \\"reboot\\" Dragon Ball, which coincided with Goku growing up. The new producer explained that ending the first anime and creating a new one would result in more promotional money, and the result was the start of Dragon Ball Z. The title was suggested by Toriyama because Z is the last letter of the alphabet and he wanted to finish the series because he was running out of ideas for it. Ironically enough, the sequel series would end up producing more episodes than its predecessor. Dragon Ball Z is adapted from the final 325 chapters of the manga series which were published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996. Because Toriyama was writing the manga during the production of the anime,Editors' roundtable, Jump Comics (Shueisha), July 2, 2004, page 88. Dragon Ball Z added original material not adapted from the manga, including lengthening scenes or adding new ones, and adding new attacks and characters not present in the manga. For example, Toriyama was asked to create an additional character for Goku's training with King Kai, resulting in the cricket Gregory. Throughout the production, the voice actors were tasked with playing different characters and performing their lines on cue, switching between roles as necessary.Dragon Ball Supplemental Daizenshuu: TV Animation Part 3, pages 107‚Äì113 The voice actors were unable to record the lines separately because of the close dialogue timing. When asked if juggling the different voices of Goku, Gohan and Goten was difficult, Masako Nozawa said that it was not, and that she was able to switch roles simply upon seeing the character's picture. She did admit that when they were producing two films a year and television specials in addition to the regular series, there were times when they had only line art to look at while recording, which made giving finer nuanced details in her performance difficult. Series Director Daisuke Nishio left the series after personally directing Episode #202. Nishio left the series to become series director of Aoki Densetsu Shoot!. The role of series director was not officially filled for Episodes #200-291, despite Nishio's directing of Episode #202. = English dub production and broadcasting = In 1996, Funimation Productions licensed Dragon Ball Z for an English-language release in North America, after cancelling their initial dub of Dragon Ball half-way through their originally-planned 26-episode first season. They worked with Saban Entertainment to syndicate the series on television, and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution. A Vancouver-based cast recording at the Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime (Funimation had previously used a similar Vancouver-based voice cast in their initial Dragon Ball dub, recorded at Dick & Roger's Sound Studio).Dragon Ball Z end credits (FUNimation/Saban dub, 1996)Dragon Ball end credits (FUNimation/BLT dub, 1995) Contract musicians for Saban, Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet, known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise, composed a new guitar-driven background score and theme song (nicknamed \\"Rock the Dragon\\"). Funimation's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length, which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53 (though TV episode 53 actually ends half-way through uncut episode 67).Dragon Ball Z Funimation/Saban dub, episodes 1-53 (1-67 uncut) Most of the edits were done to make the anime more tame and kid-friendly, most notably having references to death sidestepped with phrases like \\"sent to the next dimension\\". It premiered in the United States on September 13, 1996 in first- run syndication, but halted production in 1998 after two seasons despite strong ratings. This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations, in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block. Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 (the end of the dub) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version, but did not do so. They did, however, release uncut dubs of the first three Z movies on home video. Christopher Sabat (left) and Sean Schemmel (right) have provided Funimation's English dub voices for Vegeta and Goku, respectively, since 1999. On August 31, 1998, re-runs of this canceled dub began airing on Cartoon Network as part of the channel's weekday afternoon Toonami block. Cartoon Network eventually ordered more episodes of Dragon Ball Z, and Funimation resumed production on the series' English dub without Saban's assistance. However, they also replaced the original Vancouver-based cast with an in-house voice cast at their Texas-based studio, with the goal of the new voices sounding similar to the Vancouver cast. The Saban-produced soundtrack from the first two seasons was replaced with a new background score composed by Bruce Faulconer and his team of musicians, which was used throughout the rest of Funimation's Dragon Ball Z dub. This renewed dub featured less censorship due to both Saban's absence and fewer restrictions on cable programming, and aired new episodes on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from September 13, 1999 to April 7, 2003 (continuing in re-runs through 2008). Kids' WB briefly ran Dragon Ball Z in 2001 on its short-lived Toonami block. In 2005, Funimation began to re-dub episodes 1-67 with their in-house voice cast, including content originally cut from their dub with Saban. This dub's background score was composed by Nathan M. Johnson (Funimation had ceased working with Faulconer Productions after the final episode of Dragon Ball Z in 2003). Funimation's new uncut dub of these episodes aired on Cartoon Network as part of its Monday-Thursday late night time slot, beginning in June 2005. Funimation's later remastered DVDs of the series saw them redub portions of the dialogue, mostly after episode 67, and had the option to play the entire series' dub with both the American and Japanese background music. In January 2011, Funimation and Toei announced that they would stream Dragon Ball Z within 30 minutes before their simulcast of One Piece. As of 2017, Dragon Ball Z is no longer being streamed on Hulu. The Funimation dubbed episodes also aired in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand. However, beginning with episode 108 (123 uncut), Westwood Media (in association with Ocean Studios) produced an alternate English dub, distributed to Europe by AB Groupe. The alternate dub was created for broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland, although it also aired in Canada beginning from episode 168 (183 uncut). Funimation's in-house dub continued to air in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. The Westwood Media production used the same voice cast from the original 53-episode dub produced by Funimation, it featured an alternate soundtrack by Tom Keenlyside and John Mitchell,Dragon Ball Z end credits (Westwood Media dub, c. 2001) though most of this score was pieces Ocean reused from other productions Keenlyside and Mitchell had scored for them, and it used the same scripts and video master as the TV edit of Funimation's in-house dub. The Westwood Media dub never received a home video release. In Australia, Dragon Ball Z was broadcast by the free-to-air commercial network, Network Ten during morning children's programming, Cheez TV, originally using the censored Funimation/Saban dub before switching to Funimation's in-house dub. Dragon Ball Z originally aired on the British Comedy Network in Fall 1998.Rupert Howe, Made in Japan: Chasing the Dragon ; Pokemon Was Nicknamed 'Kiddie Crack' but a New Wave of Japanese Monsters Threatens to Be Even More Addictive.

In February 2009, Toei Animation announced that it would begin broadcasting a revised version of Dragon Ball Z as part of the series' 20th-anniversary celebrations. The series premiered on Fuji TV in Japan on April 5, 2009, under the title Dragon Ball Kai (Dragon Ball Z Kai internationally). The ending suffix in the name means \\"updated\\" or \\"altered\\" and reflects the improvements and corrections of the original work. The original footage was remastered for HDTV, featuring updated opening and ending sequences, new music, and a rerecording of the vocal tracks. The original material and any damaged frames were removed to more closely follow the manga, resulting in a faster-moving story. Torishima later explained the origins of Kai; Bandai was having a hard time increasing their sales and asked if a new Dragon Ball anime could be made, but Toriyama refused to create a new story (at the time). Realizing that the anime-exclusive scenes that were added to increase the distance between the original anime and the manga hurt the pacing of the series, Torishima thought of cutting them so that it faithfully followed the manga. He said the reception to Kai was positive and Bandai had a hit with a card game, so it all worked out. The series initially concluded on its 97th episode in Japan on March 27, 2011 with the finale of the Cell arc. It was originally planned to run 98 episodes, however, due to the T≈çhoku offshore earthquake and tsunami, the final episode was not aired and was later released direct-to-video in Japan on August 2, 2011. In November 2012, Mayumi Tanaka, the Japanese voice of Krillin, announced that she and the rest of the cast were recording more episodes of Dragon Ball Kai. In February 2014, the Kai adaptation of the Majin Buu arc was officially confirmed. The new run of the series, which is titled Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters internationally, began airing in Japan on Fuji TV on April 6, 2014 and ended its run on June 28, 2015. The final arc of Kai was originally produced to last 69 episodes (as most of the international versions run),Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters Listed at 69 Episodes. Anime News Network (April 17, 2014). Retrieved on May 12, 2014. but the Japanese broadcast cut it down to 61 episodes.  English dub production and broadcasting  Funimation licensed Kai for an English-language release in February 2010. The series was initially broadcast in the U.S. on Nicktoons from May 24, 2010 to January 1, 2012 (continuing in re-runs until April 2013).Navarre Reveals Funimation's Dragon Ball Kai License -- Anime News Network (Received February 2, 2010) In addition to Nicktoons, the series also began airing on the 4Kids-owned Saturday morning programming block Toonzai on The CW in August 2010, then on its successor, the Saban-owned Vortexx, beginning in August 2012 until the block ended in September 2014. Both the Nicktoons and CW airings were edited for content, though the CW version was censored even more so than Nicktoons. Kai began airing uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block on November 8, 2014, and re-runs of the previous week's episodes aired at the beginning of Adult Swim proper from February 2015 to June 2016. CSC Media Group acquired the broadcast rights to Kai in the United Kingdom and began airing it on Kix! in early 2013. Despite Kais continuation not being officially confirmed at the time even in Japan, Funimation voice actors Sean Schemmel (Goku) and Kyle Hebert (Gohan), announced in April 2013 that they had started recording an English dub for new episodes. In November 2013, Kai's Australasian distributor Madman Entertainment revealed that the Majin Buu arc of Kai would be released in 2014 and that they were waiting on dubs to be finished. In February 2014, Funimation officially stated that they had not yet started recording a dub for the final arc of Kai. On December 6, 2016, Funimation announced the continuation of Kai to begin airing on Adult Swim's Toonami block, airing from January 7, 2017 to June 23, 2018 (alongside Dragon Ball Super). An alternate English dub of Kai by Ocean Productions was recorded for the original 98 episodes, featuring many of the original Vancouver cast reprising their roles, but it has yet to air. = Editing = Dragon Ball Zs original North American release was the subject of heavy editing which resulted in a large amount of removed content and alterations that greatly changed the original work. Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga is often criticized for his role in the editing; but it was the initial distributor Saban which required such changes or they would not air the work, as was the case with the episode dealing with orphans. These changes included altering every aspect of the show from character names, clothing, scenes and dialogue of the show. The character Mr. Satan was renamed Hercule and this change has been retained in other English media such as Viz's Dragon Ball Z manga and video games.Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate, Battle 22, TOSE Software Co., 1995 The dialogue changes would sometimes contradict the scenes itself; after the apparent fatal explosion of a helicopter, one of the characters (most likely Tien) said, \\"I can see their parachutes; they're okay!\\" Funimation's redub for the 2005 release would address many of the issues raised by Saban, with the uncut releases preserving the integrity of the original Japanese release. During the original Japanese TV airing of Dragon Ball Kai, scenes involving blood and brief nudity were removed. Nicktoons would also alter Kai for its broadcast; it released a preview showcasing these changes which included removing the blood and cheek scar from Bardock and altering the color of Master Roshi's alcohol. The show was further edited for its broadcast on The CW; most notoriously, the character Mr. Popo was tinted blue. The show's DVD and Blu-ray releases only contained the edits present in the original Japanese version. A rumor that Cartoon Network would be airing Kai uncut was met with an official statement to debunk the rumor in June 2010; though it would later air uncut on the channel as part of Adult Swim's Toonami block. Steven Simmons, who did the subtitling for Funimation's home video releases, offered commentary on the subtitling from a project and technical standpoint, addressing several concerns. Simmons said that Gen Fukunaga did not want any swearing on the discs, but because there was no taboo word list, Simmons would substitute a variation in the strength of the words by situation with the changes starting in episode 21. The typographical errors in the script were caused by dashes (‚Äî) and double-quotes (\\") failing to appear, which resulted in confusing dialogue.  Music  Cover of the first Dragon Ball Z compilation soundtrack. Shunsuke Kikuchi composed the score for Dragon Ball Z. The opening theme for the first 199 episodes is \\"Cha- La Head-Cha-La\\" performed by Hironobu Kageyama. The second opening theme used up until the series finale at episode 291 is \\"We Gotta Power\\" also performed by Kageyama. The ending theme used for the first 199 episodes is performed by MANNA. The second ending theme used for the remaining episodes is performed by Kageyama. The initial English-Language release used a completely new musical score composed by Bruce Faulconer. It was used for the North American broadcasts of the show from 2001‚Äì2005. Kenji Yamamoto composed the score for Dragon Ball Kai. The opening theme, \\"Dragon Soul\\", and the first ending theme used for the first 54 episodes, \\"Yeah! Break! Care! Break!\\", are both performed by Takayoshi Tanimoto. The second ending theme, used from episodes 55‚Äì98, is performed by Team Dragon, a unit of the idol girl group AKB48. On March 9, 2011, Toei announced that due to Yamamoto's score infringing on the rights of an unknown third party or parties, the music for remaining episodes and reruns of previous episodes would be replaced. Later reports from Toei stated that with the exception of the series' opening and closing songs, as well as eyecatch music, Yamamoto's score was replaced with Shunsuke Kikuchi's from Dragon Ball Z. The music for The Final Chapters is composed by Norihito Sumitomo. The opening theme is by Dragon Soul, while the first ending song is by Japanese rock band Good Morning America, and the second by Leo Ieiri from episode 112 to 123. The third ending song is \\"Oh Yeah!!!!!!!\\" by Czecho No Republic from episode 124 to 136, the fourth \\"Galaxy\\" by Ky≈´so Nekokami from 137 to 146, and the fifth is \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" by Gacharic Spin from 147 to 159. The international broadcast features two pieces of theme music. The opening theme, titled \\"Fight It Out\\", is performed by rock singer Masatoshi Ono, while the ending theme is \\"Never Give Up!!!\\", performed by rhythm and blues vocalist Junear.  Related media  = Home media = In Japan, Dragon Ball Z did not receive a home video release until 2003, seven years after its broadcast. This was a remastering of the series in two 26-disc DVD box sets, that were made-to-order only, released on March 19 and September 18 and referred to as \\"Dragon Boxes.\\" The content of these sets began being released on mass-produced individual 6-episode DVDs on November 2, 2005 and finished with the 49th volume released on February 7, 2007. The international home release structure of Dragon Ball Z is complicated by the licensing and release of the companies involved in producing and distributing the work. Releases of the media occurred on both VHS and DVD with separate edited and uncut versions being released simultaneously. Both versions of the edited and uncut material are treated as different entries and would frequently make Billboard rankings as separate entries. Home release sales were featured prominently on the Nielsen VideoScan charts. Further complicating the release of the material was Funimation itself; which was known to release \\"DVDs out of sequence in order to get them out as fast as possible\\"; as in the case of their third season. Pioneer Entertainment distributed the Funimation/Saban edited-only dub of 53 episodes on seventeen VHS between 1997 and 1999, and seventeen DVDs throughout 1999. Two box sets separating them into the Saiyan and Namek arcs were also released on VHS in 1999, and on DVD in 2001. Funimation's own distribution of their initial onward dub, which began with episode 54, in edited or uncut VHS ran between 2000 and 2003. A DVD version was produced alongside these, although they were only produced uncut and contained the option to watch the original Japanese with subtitles. In 2005, Funimation began releasing their onward dub of the beginning of Dragon Ball Z on DVD, marking the first time the episodes were seen uncut in North America. However, only nine volumes were released, leaving it incomplete. Instead, Funimation remastered and cropped the entire series into 16:9 widescreen format and began re-releasing it to DVD in nine individual \\"season\\" box sets; the first set released on February 6, 2007 and the final on May 19, 2009. In July 2009, Funimation announced that they would be releasing the Japanese frame-by-frame \\"Dragon Box\\" restoration of Dragon Ball Z in North America. These seven limited edition collector's DVD box sets were released uncut in the show's original 4:3 fullscreen format between November 10, 2009 and October 11, 2011. In July 2011, Funimation announced plans to release Dragon Ball Z in Blu-ray format, with the first set released on November 8, 2011. However, production of these 4:3 sets was suspended after the second volume, citing technical concerns over restoring the original film material frame by frame. Only a year later, the company began producing a cropped 16:9 remastered Blu-ray release in 2013, with nine sets released in total. On August 13, 2013, Funimation released all 53 episodes and the three movies from their first Dragon Ball Z dub created with Saban and Ocean Studios in a collector's DVD box set, titled the Rock the Dragon Edition. In March 2019, Funimation announced plans to release a 30th anniversary Blu-ray release of Dragon Ball Z, with the box set being remastered in 4:3 aspect ratio, and containing an artbook and a collectible figure. It would be crowdfunded, originally requiring a minimum of 2500 pre- orders in order to be manufactured, but was later increased to a minimum of 3,000 units. The release sparked controversy amongst fans due to the framing of the video, color saturation and digital video noise reduction. Funimation responded by stating that they cropped the release by going in \\"scene-by-scene to make judgements based on the image available in each frame of how much to trim to get to a consistent 4:3 aspect ratio, while still attempting to cut as little out of the picture as possible,\\" and that they felt the digital video noise reduction was \\"mandatory for this release based on the different levels of fan support from various past DBZ releases with different levels of noise reduction over the years.\\"  Kai  In Japan, Dragon Ball Kai was released in wide-screen on 33 DVDs and in fullscreen on a single Blu-ray and eight four-disc Blu-ray sets from September 18, 2009, to August 2, 2011. Funimation released eight DVD and Blu-ray box sets of Dragon Ball Z Kai from May 18, 2010 to June 5, 2012. These sets contain the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles, as well as the uncut version of the English dub, which does not contain any of the edits made for the TV airings. Before the final volume was even published, Funimation began re-releasing the series in four DVD and Blu-ray \\"season\\" sets between May 22, 2012 and March 12, 2013. Funimation released The Final Chapters in three DVD and Blu-ray volumes from April 25 to June 20, 2017.The Final Chapter ‚Äì Part Two ‚Äì Blu-ray  home- videoThe Final Chapter ‚Äì Part Three ‚Äì Blu-ray  home-video = Manga = While the manga was all titled Dragon Ball in Japan, due to the popularity of the Dragon Ball Z anime in the west, Viz Media initially changed the title of the last 26 volumes of the manga to \\"Dragon Ball Z\\" to avoid confusion. The volumes were originally published in Japan between 1988 and 1995. It began serialization in the American Shonen Jump, beginning in the middle of the series with the appearance of Trunks; the tank≈çbon volumes of both Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball were released simultaneously by Viz Media in the United States. In March 2001, Viz continued this separation by re-shipping the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z titles starting with the first volumes of each work. Viz's marketing for the manga made distinct the differences between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z tone. Viz billed Dragon Ball Z: \\"More action-packed than the stories of Goku's youth, Dragon Ball Z is pure adrenaline, with battles of truly Earth-shaking proportions!\\" Between 2008 and 2010, Viz re- released the two series in a format called \\"Viz Big Edition,\\" which collects three individual volumes into a single large volume. However, in 2013 Viz began publishing new 3-in-1 volumes collecting the entire manga series, including what they previously released as Dragon Ball Z, under the Dragon Ball name. = Films = The Dragon Ball Z films comprise a total of 15 entries as of 2015. The first 13 films were typically released every March and July during the series' original run in accordance with the spring and summer vacations of Japanese schools. They were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. These films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. All 15 films were licensed in North America by Funimation, and all have received in-house dubs by the company. Prior to Funimation, the third film was a part of the short-lived Saban syndication, being split into three episodes, and the first three films received uncut English dubs in 1998 produced by Funimation with Ocean Studios and released by Pioneer. Several of the films have been broadcast on Cartoon Network and Nicktoons in the United States, Toonami UK in the United Kingdom (these featured an alternate English dub produced by an unknown cast by AB Groupe), and Cartoon Network in Australia. = Television specials and original video animations = Three TV specials based on Dragon Ball Z were produced and broadcast on Fuji TV. The first two were Dragon Ball Z: Bardock ‚Äì The Father of Goku in 1990 and Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks in 1993, the latter being based on a special chapter of the original manga. Both were licensed by Funimation in North America and AB Groupe in Europe. In 2013, a two-part hour-long crossover with One Piece and Toriko, titled Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Ch≈ç Collaboration Special!!, was created and aired. Additionally, two original video animations (OVAs) bearing the Dragon Ball Z title have been made. The first is Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans, which was originally released in 1993 in two parts as \\"Official Visual Guides\\" for the video game of the same title. Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans was a 2010 remake of this OVA. None of the OVAs have been dubbed into English, and the only one to see a release in North America is the 2010 remake, which was subtitled and included as a bonus feature in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2. = Video games = There are over 57 video games bearing the Dragon Ball Z name across a range of platforms from the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom to the current generation consoles. Also included are arcade games like Super Dragon Ball Z, which would eventually be ported to consoles. In North America, licensing rights had been given to both Namco Bandai and Atari. In 1999, Atari acquired exclusive rights to the video games through Funimation, a deal which was extended for five more years in 2005. A 2007 dispute would end with Atari paying Funimation $3.5 million. In July 2009, Namco Bandai was reported to have obtained exclusive rights to release the games for a period of five years. This presumably would have taken effect after Atari's licensing rights expired at the end of January 2010. = Soundtracks = Dragon Ball Z has been host to numerous soundtrack releases with works like \\"Cha-La Head-Cha-La\\" and a series of 21 soundtracks released as part of the Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series. In total, dozens of releases exist for Dragon Ball Z which includes Japanese and foreign adapted releases of the anime themes and video game soundtracks.  Reception  In Asia, the Dragon Ball Z franchise, including the anime and merchandising, earned a profit of $3billion by 1999. In the United States, the series sold over 25million DVDs as of January 2012. Dragon Ball fans set a Guinness World Record for Largest Kamehameha attack move at San Diego Comic con on July 17, 2019. = Cultural impact and legacy = Dragon Ball Z was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's \\"Top 100 Animated Series\\", and was also listed as the 50th greatest animated show in Wizard magazine's \\"Top 100 Greatest Animated shows\\" list. The series ranked #6 on Wizard's Anime Magazine on their \\"Top 50 Anime released in North America\\". Dragon Ball Zs popularity is reflected through a variety of data through online interactions which show the popularity of the media. In 2001, it was reported that the official website of Dragon Ball Z recorded 4.7 million hits per day and included 500,000+ registered fans. The term \\"Dragonball Z\\" ranked 4th in 1999 and 2nd in 2000 by Lycos' web search engine. For 2001, \\"Dragonball\\" was the most popular search on Lycos and \\"Dragonball Z\\" was fifth on Yahoo!. In 2005, media historian Hal Erickson wrote that \\"Dragon Ball may be the closest thing on American television to an animated soap opera ‚Äî though this particular genre is an old, established and venerated one in Japan, the series' country of origin.\\" Christopher J. Olson and CarrieLynn D. Reinhard note that \\"Western fans flocked to Dragon Ball Z because it offered exciting action not found in movies or television shows (animated or otherwise) at that time.\\" In 2015, Ford Motor Company released two commercials featuring characters from the series, the first advertising the Ford Fusion and the second for the Ford Focus. = Ratings = Dragon Ball Z's Japanese run was very popular with an average viewer ratings of 20.5% across the series. Dragon Ball Z also proved to be a rating success in the United States, outperforming top shows such as Friends and The X-Files in some parts of the country in sweeps ratings during its first season. The premiere of season three of Dragon Ball Z in 1999, done by Funimation's in-house dub, was the highest-rated program ever at the time on Cartoon Network. In 2002, in the week ending September 22, Dragon Ball Z was the #1 program of the week on all of television with tweens 9-14, boys 9-14 and men 12-24, with the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday telecasts of Dragon Ball Z ranked as the top three programs in all of television, broadcast or cable, for delivery of boys 9-14. In 2001, Cartoon Network obtained licensing to run 96 more episodes and air the original Dragon Ball anime and was the top rated show in the Toonami block of Cartoon network. Beginning March 26, 2001, Cartoon Network ran a 12-week special promotion \\"Toonami Reactor\\" which included a focus on Dragon Ball Z, which would stream episodes online to high- speed internet users. Many home video releases were met with both the edited and unedited versions placing on in the top 10 video charts of Billboard. For example, \\"The Dark Prince Returns\\" (containing episodes 226-228) and \\"Rivals\\" (containing episodes 229-231) edited and unedited, made the Billboard magazine top video list for October 20, 2001. The first episode of Dragon Ball Kai earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of One Piece and behind Crayon Shin-chan. Although following episodes had lower ratings, Kai was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run. Towards the end of the original run the ratings hovered around 9%-10%.

However, he also led a feared gang that smuggled Captagon via Syria and Saudi Arabia, according to the Susurluk scandal Mƒ∞T report. His tourism company facilitated the trafficking. The report says that Yaprak donated 500 billion LiraThe Turkish lira was experiencing hyperinflation at the time, so it is difficult to translate into foreign currency. The donation was made towards the elections on 24 December 1995, when the interbank rate was 57,700 Lira/$US. At the beginning of the same year, the parity was 38,900 Lira/$US. The contribution is therefore on the order of $8.7 million to $13m. to support Mehmet Aƒüar's electoral campaign. Upon learning of Yaprak's wealth, Abdullah √áatlƒ± and a team of 6‚Äì7 dressed in police uniform kidnapped Yaprak on 25 May 1996 and took him to a house in Siverek belonging to the Bucak clan. The kidnapping, motivated by the desire to know where the Captagon was coming from and cut Topal out of the loop, was directed by police in Ankara. Yaprak paid 10 million DM in ransom, however √áatlƒ± and his fellow kidnappers received only a small portion of this. When they found out that they had been cheated, they fell out with their overlords in Ankara. They then kidnapped Yaprak a second time and interrogated him, sending one copy of the interrogation tape to Bucak and another to Eym√ºr through Mƒ∞T agent M√ºfit Sement. Leveraging the tapes, √áatlƒ± worked out an agreement with Ankara. Yaprak was convicted in 1997 for involvement in the assassination of Gaziantep Bar lawyer Burhan Veli Torun, and released due to an amnesty law (). In 2002, he was re-imprisoned after being caught with 5 million pills of Captagon. He died in prison, January 2004.

She married into the politically active Lupton family of Leeds, where she co-founded Leeds Girls' High School in 1876 and was the Leeds representative of the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women. Early life Lupton was born Frances Elizabeth Greenhow on 20 July 1821, into a medical family in Newcastle upon Tyne. Her father, Thomas Michael Greenhow, co-founded the city's Eye Infirmary, with Sir John Fife, and then Newcastle University Medical School. He worked at Newcastle Infirmary, renamed the Royal Victoria Infirmary, for many years and was instrumental in its expansion in the 1850s. Her mother, Elizabeth, was born into the Martineau family, an intellectual, business, and political dynasty. Many of her relatives were nationally prominent as Unitarians, a branch of English Dissenters; a main hall of the post-Blitz rebuilding of Essex Hall ‚Äì the national headquarters for British Unitarians ‚Äì was named after them. Elizabeth grew up in Norwich, attending the Octagon Chapel. Her siblings included James, the religious philosopher and professor at Manchester New College (known today as Harris Manchester College, Oxford University); Harriet, the social theorist and Whig writer, often cited as the first female sociologist; and Robert, Mayor of Birmingham. Thomas and Elizabeth Greenhow lived in Newcastle's fashionable Old Eldon Square. The couple had several children; Frances and at least two boys. Henry Martineau Greenhow (1829‚Äì1912) followed his father into medicine. He joined the Indian Medical Service and spent his career in British India, rising to surgeon major. His garrison withstood the Siege of Lucknow, a key part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.Entry in Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online, a biographical register of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, written by its librarian Victor Plarr (1863‚Äì1929), and hosted by the College Another brother, William Thomas Greenhow (1831‚Äì1921) became a judge. The siblings' first cousin Edward Headlam Greenhow was a physician-academic, who made his mark in epidemiology and public health. Frances was educated at her aunt Rachel Martineau's school and remained close to Rachel's sister Harriet in adulthood. The Unitarian ethos of liberalism and service to society stayed with her throughout her life. Marriage and children Francis Lupton in 1847 In 1847 Frances married Francis Lupton (1813‚Äì1884), a member of a prosperous and politically active cloth manufacturing family in Leeds. In addition to his business interests, he was one of the founders of the Yorkshire College of Science in 1874, which became part of the federal Victoria University, and from 1904 the University of Leeds. The Luptons were Unitarians who worshipped at Mill Hill Chapel on Leeds City Square, where a stained glass window commemorates them. Frances married into a family of activists. Her husband's younger brother, Joseph Lupton, was president and later vice-president of Manchester New College, the training college for ministers where Frances's uncle taught. He was an anti-slavery campaigner and a Liberal who sat on the executive of the National Reform Union. He sat on the committee for the National Society for Women's Suffrage. The brothers' cousin Jane married the minister at Mill Hill, Charles Wicksteed, an educational reformer. He co-founded the Leeds Education Society, a precursor to the National Education League. Francis and Frances lived just outside the rapidly industrialising city at Potternewton Hall, later moving to Beechwood, a Georgian country house in Roundhay. Francis had farms at Beechwood and worked as a director of the family wool manufacturing firm until he died suddenly at the age of 70 in 1884. The Luptons had five sons, Francis Martineau, Arthur, Herbert (who died young), Charles, and Hugh. When her brother's wife died, she took in their daughter Mabel Greenhow to raise alongside her own children; Mabel grew up to write as Mrs Murray Hickson. Her four surviving sons contributed to the civic life of Leeds; two became Lord Mayor of Leeds. Through Olive Middleton (1881‚Äì1936), the eldest child of her eldest child Francis Martineau (d.1921), Frances Lupton is the great-great-great- grandmother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Female education reform =Context= Secular education of women became a more pressing issue by the mid-19th century. Girls' schools, including small boarding establishments, had existed for generations (for example Mary Wollstonecraft's school in Newington Green in the 1780s, with ties to Newington Green Unitarian Church and the Newington Academy for Girls, set up by Quakers in 1824), but a new impetus was given by the founding of colleges offering single-sex education to young women. Queen's College, London opened in London in 1848 to provide qualifications for governesses. The first girls' schools targeted at university entrance were North London Collegiate School (from 1850) and Cheltenham Ladies' College (from the appointment of Dorothea Beale in 1858). Emily Davies campaigned for women's higher education in the 1860s, and founded Girton in 1869, and Anne Clough founded Newnham in 1875 ‚Äì both of these colleges were affiliated with but not entirely accepted by the University of Cambridge. Lupton's aunt Harriet Martineau paid a visit to the United States in 1834, one of her areas of interest was the emerging girls' schools. In Society in America (1837), the sociologist criticised the state of female education: > \\"The intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of ... > education ... As women have none of the objects in life for which an > enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given ... > The choice is to either be ill-educated, passive, and subservient, or well- > educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance.\\" =Lupton's impact= Lupton's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes her pioneering work in expanding the opportunities for female education. In 1871 Lupton became Honorary Secretary to the Ladies' Honorary Council of the Yorkshire Board of Education, which was then just six years old. She was \\"the powerful driving force of the organization\\" and also that of the Leeds Ladies' Educational Association. One of her first successes was setting up a students' library. Soon, the committees had arranged to superintend the first Cambridge Local Examination for women in Leeds. However, the most pressing need was for better all-round education for girls, equivalent to what boys received at traditional academic grammar school. Established interests prevented the use of existing charitable funds, despite the passage of the Endowed Schools Act 1869, so Lupton led a meeting between the Leeds Association and the Ladies Council to create a new way forward ‚Äì a joint stock company. Her business acumen led to the establishment of Leeds Girls' High School in 1876. Lupton and the Ladies Council also saw the need for the dissemination of practical information on traditionally female subjects such as health and nursing. They launched a cookery school in 1874, having requested but not received help from civil servant Sir Henry Cole. In the following decade, the Yorkshire Training School of Cookery developed teacher training courses at the request of the school boards ‚Äì eventually this formed a component of Leeds Metropolitan University. By 1872, the Manchester Ladies' Educational Association of the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (NECPHEW) was represented by Elizabeth Gaskell's daughter Meta with Frances representing NECPHEW's Leeds Ladies' Educational Association. As a council member, Frances also belonged to the Education for Girls Committee of the Royal Society of Arts which, from 1871, had aligned itself with the aims of NECPHEW.

Most of what is known about him comes from information he supplied for Sainsbury's dictionary in 1824. As a boy he was taught the violin by Anton√≠n Kammel, and later by Wilhelm Cramer, leader of the Italian Opera orchestra at the King's Theatre. Blake himself played the violin in this orchestra from about 1775, and also at the Concert of Ancient Music. He came into public prominence however as a viola player. He was principal and soloist at the Professional Concert from 1785 to 1793, appearing regularly in string quartets with Cramer. He also played the viola at the Prince of Wales's musical evenings, and his unusual interest in this instrument led to his publishing 18 duos for violin and viola in the 1780s. After the 1793 season Blake resigned from public performance. He was already studying the piano under Clementi to equip himself as a teacher, and though he continued to play the viola for the Prince of Wales he lived almost entirely by teaching until 1820 when he retired.

Only after Haydn's return to Vienna in 1793 did Clementi once again fully resume his activities, even as an orchestral conductor. During these years he is known to have composed three new symphonies. When Haydn returned to London in 1794-5, Clementi's celebrity was once again eclipsed. In the meantime, however, the number of his private pupils grew: apart from Cramer and others, they included John Field, Beno√Æt- Auguste Bertini, Miss Parke, Arthur Thomas Corfe, Benjamin Blake, Mme.

In December 2012, the website went through significant changes such as logo and layout refreshments. Currently there are 60,169 films, 4,247 TV series (not mentioning episodes), and 191,950 actors and actresses in the database.  History  The founding of the site dates back to October 1986 when the first radio broadcast entitled \\"Stopklatka\\" appeared in Academic Radio \\"Pomorze\\" in Szczecin. The creators of the broadcast included Daniel Bochi≈Ñski and Mariusz Ma≈õlanka together with Adam Bortnik who joined them in 1987 and worked on the position of the President of the Board between 2000 and 2011. In 1993 the broadcast was relocated to the local radio \\"ABC\\" in Szczecin when its current editor-in-chief, Krzysztof Sp√≥r, joined the team. In August 1996, Adam Bortnik created a website \\"Stopklatka\\" as a part of the Radio ABC web service. Content of the website was created by Krzysztof Sp√≥r. In autumn the same year S≈Çawomir Cicho≈Ñ became a member of the group and soon after that a web portal using a custom domain name was launched. On the basis of the legal contract signed with Microsoft Corporation, the portal became one of ten Polish news channels preinstalled in the Internet Explorer 4.0 browser. In May 1998, Bortnik and Cicho≈Ñ, each of whom contributed 50% of the company's capital, registered Stopklatka Partnership. S≈Çawomir Cicho≈Ñ resigned from the cooperation in 1999. At that point Przemys≈Çaw Basiak, who cooperated with the company in earlier stages, entered into partnership. Przemys≈Çaw Basiak‚Äôs education in IT, experience in designing and building websites together with passion for films were a perfect complement to Adam Bortnik‚Äôs and Krzysztof Sp√≥r‚Äôs knowledge and film passion. Apart from the company‚Äôs main activity which was portal‚Äôs maintenance, Stopklatka Partnership started to provide service of designing, creating and maintaining websites for clients from the film industry. In 2000 talks with a prospective investor from the industry, PROKOM Software S.A., resulted in the formation of Stopklatka LLC intended to continue the previous partnership‚Äôs activity. The investor, PROKOM Internet S.A., one of holding companies of PROKOM Software S.A., later NET INTERNET S.A., received 80% of Stopklatka LLC‚Äôs shares. Adam Bortnik and Przemys≈Çaw Basiak became shareholders and members of the board of the newly created company. In the middle of 2009 Stopklatka LLC was transformed into a joint-stock company due to the plans of introducing its shares to be traded on the NewConnect market. On May 6, 2012 shareholders at the annual general meeting passed a resolution to issue B-series shares and apply for the introduction of company‚Äôs shares to trading on NewConnect. On May 31, 2010, as a result of selling a part of the shares by Net Internet S.A., the company gained a new strategic investor, Kino Polska TV LLC which in August, 2010, transformed into Kino Polska TV S.A. and became a member of the Media Group, SPI. On December 6, 2010, after the contract with Net Internet S.A. had been signed, Kino Polska TV S.A. became the majority shareholder (65,22%) of Stopklatka LLC. On July 12, 2010, the company made its debut on the alternative stock exchange, NewConnect, owned by Warsaw Stock Exchange.

This painting was documented by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909 and Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote \\"98. A FOOL WITH A MANDOLINE. B. 45; M. 216.- Half-length. A man turned half- right, in a red costume trimmed with yellow. He has long hair, and wears a red and yellow cap. His head is seen in full face ; he looks up to the left. With his right hand he touches the strings of a mandoline ; his left hand grasps the neck. Very freely handled. Especially good are the various contrasting flesh-tones, the red and yellow of the costume, and the reflections in the eyes. [Compare 95.] Signed in the right at top, F.

A copy (B. 16, and see M. 216) is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1907 catalogue, No. 1093 ; it measures 26 inches by 24 inches, having rather less at the foot than the original. In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris..\\" Hofstede de Groot on A Fool with a Mandoline; catalog number 98 The theme of a lute player painted at half length originated in Italy, and the Dutch painter Dirck van Baburen first introduced this theme in the Northern Netherlands with his lute player of 1622. Baburen's player is pointing his lute towards the viewer with his mouth open in song. Hals' player is looking up and smiling naturally, as if he is playing with a singer or another musician not in view. This painting is a good example of Hals' \\"rough style\\" of painting with loose brush strokes. A period copy now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum has been dated before 1626 based on an engraving, and it has been attributed variously to Hals, his brother Dirk, and Judith Leyster.Frans Hals: Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962., pp 35-36, publication Frans Hals Museum, 1962De luitspeler, ca. 1623 - 1624 by unknown copyist in the RijksmuseumRecord for the copy of the Lute player in the RKD Two other paintings of lute players by Hals are: File:Frans Hals 001.pngThe Fingernail Test File:Frans Hals - Boy with a glass and a lute.jpgBoy with a Glass and a Lute Hals was not the only painter to be influenced by Baburen.

Webb, Sr. and Ellen Hanor. His father was supervisor of writing and drawing for the public schools in Nashville. From 1907 to 1909, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1911, he enrolled at The Stout Institute in Wisconsin, where he studied building trades in preparation for a course in architecture. From 1912-1913 he studied architecture at the University of Illinois. During 1914 and 1915 he practised in Chicago, winning several medals for architectural designs. He later attended the Art Students League of New York and worked with Dan Barber, a New York architect. First World War and life in Europe During the First World War he served with the American Engineering Forces in France, first as a sergeant and then as a commissioned second Lieutenant. After the armistice in 1918 he remained in Europe, and from March to June 1919 attended the art school opened for American soldiers at the A.E.F. Art Training Center in Bellevue, France. In September 1919 he was demobilized from the army and study design in Italy and illustration in Spain and the United Kingdom. After which, he spent the next six months traveling in Europe and seeing as much art as possible until his money was exhausted. Determined to stay in France, he began looking for a way to make a living in Paris. Unable to work as an architect, he began making signs in English for the millinery shops along the Rue de Rivoli, which led in time to advertisements and designs for some of the fashionable houses along the rue de la Paix and the Place Vend√¥me. This led to work with a firm manufacturing heating apparatus and Webb applied his old architectural training to radiators and posters illustrating the installation of modern heating plants in Old World chateaux. About 1920, he started etching and his work began appearing frequently in the French weekly L‚ÄôIllustration. During the 1920s and 1930s, Webb lived and worked in both France and the United States. He etched many architectural images of France and Italian cities and American centers such as New York, Chicago, and Pittsburg. Many of Webb's European views were published and exhibited by the Marcel Guiot Gallery, Paris. In the late 1930s he moved to London, where he died in 1975.

Ben Ratliff and Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote \\"The record isn't making any kind of argument on behalf of free improvising. Mr. Lovano isn't partisan like that. There's a gold-star version here of one of jazz's most elegant ballad standards, Billy Strayhorn's \\"Star Crossed Lovers,\\" with rustling free rhythm at the beginning and end and easy swing in the middle. Mr. Lovano's performance is a knockout. Both he and Mr. Weidman play with care and attention to the song's changes; Ms. Spalding plays a melodic, songlike bass solo. But right after that comes a runic, short-melody, Paul Motian-inspired piece called \\"Journey Within,\\" and then \\"Drum Chant,\\" a raw and generous jam session that at a little over four minutes feels too long. \\"Cross Culture\\" covers the bases, showing you all it can do, though surely not out of a desire to impress.

He was born at Lambeth in London and died at Leicester, Leicestershire. Thursting was a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He played in a trial match for Surrey in 1932. By 1934, he was playing for Marylebone Cricket Club as one of the professionals employed as ground staff by the club. He was recruited by Leicestershire in 1938 from the ground-staff at Lord's primarily as a bowler, but had little success at that. Instead he developed very quickly as a right-handed opening batsman, with opportunities opening up because of injuries to Francis Prentice and then Stewie Dempster's regular unavailability. His high point and his highest score came in the match against Warwickshire when his 94, made in four and a quarter hours, helped Leicestershire to save the game after they had to follow on. In the season, he scored 625 runs at an average of 27.17. From this promising beginning, Thursting's first-class cricket career never really developed. In 1939, though Leicestershire were a poor team and finished bottom of the County Championship, the batting line-up stabilised without Thursting and he played only eight games, batting mostly at No 8, though he managed two fifties from that position.

Orr's subsequent negotiations sought to get creditors to willingly \\"take a haircut\\" on Detroit's debt, and were ultimately unsuccessful. On July 19, 2013, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of the Thirtieth Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan ruled the bankruptcy filing by Detroit violated Article IX, Section 24, of the Michigan Constitution and ordered Governor Rick Snyder to withdraw the filing immediately. On July 23, an appeals court stayed the circuit court ruling pending future rulings on Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette's appeal.Michigan Appeals Court halts challenges to Detroit's bankruptcy filing CNBC, July 23, 2013 On July 24, the Bankruptcy Court added its own, federal stay of the state court proceedings. On August 2, the bankruptcy court set a hearing date of October 23, 2013, for trial on any objections to the city's eligibility for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and March 1, 2014, as the deadline for the city to file a bankruptcy plan. After a nine-day trial on eligibility, the Bankruptcy Court on December 3, 2013, ruled Detroit eligible for Chapter 9 on its $18.5 billion debt. On June 3, 2014 the Michigan Legislature passed a package of bills to help Detroit avoid further bankruptcy proceedings.Dolan, Matt (June 3, 2014) Michigan Gov. Snyder Pledges to Sign Detroit Package Wall Street Journal. On the same day, Governor Snyder pledged to sign the package of bills. After a two-month trial, Judge Steven W. Rhodes confirmed the city's plan of adjustment on November 7, 2014, paving the way for Detroit to exit bankruptcy. Creditors and insurers were expected to absorb losses totaling $7 billion, with creditors receiving between 14 and 75 cents on the dollar.  Background  In April 2012, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and the nine-member City Council entered into an agreement with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder that allowed for greater fiscal oversight by the state government in exchange for the state's providing Detroit help with its finances. A financial review team was appointed in December 2012 to conduct a 60-day review. The team consisted of Andy Dillon (Treasurer of Michigan), Thomas McTavish (Michigan Chief Financial Officer and Auditor General), Ken Whippel (Korn/Ferry), Darrell Burks (PricewaterhouseCoopers), Ronald Goldsberry (Deloitte Consulting) and Frederick Headen.Goodman, David (December 18, 2012) \\"Detroit Financial Review Team, Including State Treasurer Andy Dillon, Chosen By Gov. Rick Snyder\\". Huffington Post In February 2013, Snyder announced that the Michigan state government was taking financial control of the city of Detroit, as it viewed that Detroit failed to meet deadlines set by the state government. In accordance with Public Act 72 of 1990, the state government's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board appointed Kevyn Orr emergency financial manager of Detroit following a declaration of financial emergency. As emergency manager, Orr was granted the power to rewrite Detroit's contracts and to liquidate city assets. A report on the financial health of Detroit was released by Orr in May 2013. The report stated that Detroit is \\"clearly insolvent on a cash flow basis\\" and that the city would finish its current fiscal year with a US$162 million cash-flow shortfall. It also stated that the city's budget deficit would reach $386 million in less than two months and that one-third of the city's budget was going toward retiree benefits. In June 2013, the government of Detroit stopped making payments on some of its unsecured debts, including pension obligations. In an effort to avoid bankruptcy, Orr sought to persuade some of Detroit's creditors to accept 10% of the amount they are owed. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, during a press conference in July, that he knew of no plans by President Obama to bail out the Detroit city government similar to the bailouts in recent years of Detroit-area automakers General Motors and Chrysler. On July 17, just one day before the bankruptcy filing, Detroit's two largest municipal pension funds filed suit in state court to prevent Orr from cutting retiree benefits as part of his efforts to cut the city's budget deficit. Since 1937, there have been over 600 other Chapter 9 bankruptcies in the United States of cities, towns, villages, counties, and special-purpose districts. The largest previous Chapter 9 bankruptcy happened in Jefferson County, Alabama, in 2011.  Bankruptcy filing  After several months of negotiations, Orr was ultimately unable to come to a deal with Detroit's creditors, unions, and pension boards and therefore filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Michigan U.S. Bankruptcy Court on July 18, 2013. Snyder approved the filing by Orr in a letter attached to the court documents. Some of the named causes for the bankruptcy are the shrinking tax base caused by declining population, program costs for retiree health care and pension, borrowing to cover budget deficits (since 2008), poor record keeping and antiquated computer systems, that 47% of owners had not paid their 2011 property taxes,Half of Detroit property owners don't pay taxes Detroit News, February 21, 2013 and government corruption. Two city workers' pension plans had for nearly 25 years been paying out \\"13th month\\" checks. View of Downtown Detroit from Belle Isle Park, one of Detroit's several assets that cannot be sold Bankruptcies of cities, towns, villages and counties since the Great Depression are rare (about 60 since 1950, i.e. around 1 per year; special district bankruptcies have been more numerous), and how Detroit will be affected is unclear. Detroit's estimated long-term debt was more than $14 billion and could be between $18 and $20 billion, far exceeding the $4 billion in debt of Jefferson County, Alabama, that had been the largest American municipal bankruptcy filing to date. It is also the largest city by population in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy, with more than double the population of Stockton, California, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012. State officials said that city services will not be affected immediately by the bankruptcy filing. Municipal workers with pensions are not insured by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, since they work for a municipality and not a business, and some also had received pensions in lieu of Social Security benefits. According to a Detroit area bankruptcy attorney, legal costs for the bankruptcy proceedings could cost Detroit \\"tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars.\\" Orr hopes that Detroit can emerge from bankruptcy by late Summer or Fall in 2014; he says that the process is moving as \\"expeditiously as possible\\". Orr has considered the sale of valuable city assets, but other arrangements or regulations make it difficult to sell some of them. For instance, valuable works at the Detroit Institute of Arts cannot be sold due to private and city agreements, as well as state law; other city assets that could be sold include the Coleman A. Young International Airport and the Belle Isle Park. Eddie Francis, the mayor of the neighboring city of Windsor, Ontario, has said that his city would consider purchasing Detroit's half of the international Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel if it is offered for sale.  Reaction  Yields on bonds issued by the city of Detroit increased on July 18 to record highs, as investors considered the potential effects of the bankruptcy filing. Rates had already escalated when yields jumped from 8.39% in mid-May to 16% in mid-June 2013. The credit rating agency Moody's said that the bankruptcy filing was credit negative for Detroit and that it created an \\"unprecedented litigation scenario,\\" which could impact services city residents receive, as well as how much bondholders would recover from Detroit. Business and labor leaders reacted to the filing. Detroit union leaders called Orr's move to declare bankruptcy premature due to ongoing financial negotiations with creditors, unions, and pension boards, but also stated that employees will continue to work in a typical fashion. The only major U.S. automaker headquartered in Detroit itself, General Motors, said it \\"is proud to call Detroit home and ... (this is) a day that we and others hoped would not come. We believe, however, that today also can mark a clean start for the city.\\" Politicians have commented on the bankruptcy. Bing said that the people of Detroit \\"have to make the best of it\\". Snyder stated that \\"I know many will see this as a low point in the city‚Äôs history,\\" \\"If so, I think it will also be the foundation of the city‚Äôs future‚Äîa statement I cannot make in confidence absent giving the city a chance for a fresh start, without burdens of debt it cannot hope to fully pay.\\" President Barack Obama said that he is following the developments and that he is \\"committed to continuing our strong partnership\\" with Detroit. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul stated that he will not allow the government to bail out the city, saying \\"He is bailing them out over my dead body, because we don‚Äôt have any money in Washington.\\" Snyder also stated that he did not support a government bail out. \\"It's not just about putting more money in a situation,\\" he said. \\"It's about better services to citizens again. It's about accountable government.\\" Detroit's debts included $369 million in unlimited general obligation bonds, bonds issued with the general backing of taxpayers, described by Florida bond finance director Ben Watkins as \\"[having] been the gold standard of the municipal-bond market\\". The offer by Kevyn Orr to settle these for less than 20% face value, and doubts regarding the willingness of Michigan to assume the debts, was predicted to drive up borrowing costs of nearby municipalities. This effect has been seen in regard to localities in Michigan. Three have so far had to postpone new bond offerings or face higher interest rates. However, this concern has not materialized on a wider scale, as investors have actually treated municipal general obligation bonds as safer than before the filing. Recent history from California \\"has shown that the fallout from a bankruptcy can dissipate quickly\\" in the bond market. Contributing to this is the fact that Moody's has fewer than 40 of the 7,500 local governments that it rates listed as below investment grade. Soon after Detroit declared bankruptcy, it was reported that the city would continue with plans for a bond issue to fund a new $444 million arena for the Detroit Red Wings. Repayment of the bonds would be split between taxpayers and developers of the arena. Both Snyder and Orr acknowledged concerns raised about the expense, but stated that continuing the project makes good economic sense even with the context of Detroit's bankruptcy. With the arena, and additional retail, office, residential and hotel space the developer has committed to build as part of the overall project, it is expected to create about 8,000 construction jobs, with work due to start in 2014.New $444 million hockey arena is still a go in Detroit, CNN, July 26, 2013  Legal developments  = From bankruptcy filing to eligibility ruling = Detroit at Milwaukee Junction, looking southwest at the Russell Industrial Center On July 19, 2013, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina ruled, using a typed statement with hand-written notes attached, that the bankruptcy filing by Detroit violated the Michigan constitution by impairing pension payments and ordered Snyder to withdraw the filing: Snyder has appealed the motion, and Aquilina indicated she was sending a copy of her ruling to President Obama. While under Article IX, Section 24, of the Michigan Constitution, neither the state nor any of its \\"political subdivisions\\" are permitted to default on the accrued financial benefits of their pension plans or retirement systems, federal law may allow bankruptcy judges to renegotiate pensions of municipalities in bankruptcy. Many consider public pension benefits of existing retirees \\"virtually untouchable\\"; the clash between state constitutional protections of vested public pension rights and the general ability of the bankruptcy process to modify debt obligations has yet to be fully tested in any Chapter 9 proceeding. On July 22, Aquilina delayed to July 29 her hearing on retiree funds request for an order directing Orr and Snyder to withdraw the bankruptcy filing and desist from any effort to reduce vested pension benefits in the face of their protected status under the Michigan Constitution. This legal move allowed the bankruptcy court to weigh in. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes scheduled a hearing on July 24, on the city's request that the retiree state court suit be stayed because of the pending federal bankruptcy case. Rhodes indicated that the bankruptcy court, not the state court, has the authority to resolve the dispute between the city and the retiree funds over the city's authorization to file the bankruptcy case. On July 23, a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled unanimously to stay the proceedings in the state court actions, pending a resolution of the state's appeal of Aquilina's rulings directing withdrawal of the bankruptcy filing. In another development in the bankruptcy case, Rhodes indicated in a filing on July 23 his intent to appoint a mediator to work with the parties in the bankruptcy. Rhodes indicated that the mediator would be Chief Judge Gerald Rosen of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. On July 24, the bankruptcy court held a two-hour hearing on the city's request for a stay of the pending state court proceedings against Snyder and Orr. Rhodes then granted the federal stay and ruled that Orr is a validly authorized officer to act for the city in the bankruptcy. Rhodes ordered that three suits filed by city employees, retirees and pension funds in State Court be halted. He made it clear that all legal battles will be fought in the Federal Bankruptcy Court Rhodes emphasized that he was not on July 24 deciding whether the city met the statutory criteria for eligibility for a Chapter 9 filing, nor the effect on the bankruptcy case of Michigan's constitutional protection of vested public pension benefits. On July 27, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that he would enter an appearance in the bankruptcy case for the purpose of defending Michigan's constitutional protection of vested public pension benefits. Schuette said that in doing so he would be acting in his role as \\"the people's attorney.\\" Schuette acknowledged that there is no action currently pending in the case related to public pensions, but he stated that by filing an appearance he \\"will be able to defend the state constitution if and when this does occur.\\" Schuette's office also represents Snyder, who favors cuts to Detroit's public pension plans as an element of restoring the city to financial stability. Schuette's spokesperson said that his office would continue to represent the governor and other state agencies in the bankruptcy; different sets of attorneys in the attorney general's office will represent these divergent positions. A spokesperson for emergency manager Orr said that Orr \\"respects the attorney general‚Äôs concern for Detroit‚Äôs pensioners. This is an important issue that will be decided, appropriately, by a federal bankruptcy judge.\\" On August 2, the bankruptcy court held a status conference, set an initial schedule for the case, and made several initial rulings. The court set August 19 as the deadline for any party to file objections to the city's eligibility for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and October 23 as the hearing date for trial on such objections. The court set March 1, 2014, as the deadline for the city to file a plan of adjustment for its debts. The court ordered the appointment of a fee examiner to review the fees incurred by attorneys and other professionals for the City, and invited comments on naming an appropriate person to fill this role. The court presented a proposed order establishing a mediation process aimed at facilitating settlement of disputed issues that will arise in the case, and inviting comments on the naming of an appropriate mediator, with the court having initially proposed Chief Judge Gerald Rosen of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The court ordered the Office of the U.S. Trustee to appoint an official committee to represent retired employees of the city, with the U.S. Trustee to select the members to serve on this Retiree Committee. The professional expenses of the Retiree Committee will be paid by the city, which consented to do so. When a fee examiner is appointed, the professional expenses of the Retiree Committee will also be subject to the examiner's review. On August 19, Rhodes appointed Robert M. Fishman, an attorney with the Chicago law firm Shaw Fishman Glantz and Tobin, as the fee examiner. Fishman's own fees are charged at $600 per hour. Another attorney who has served as an expert witness in fee matters commented that, while the fees will no doubt be large, legal fees are always a small percentage of what is at stake in a bankruptcy of this magnitude. On August 13, Judge Rhodes, after receiving input from various parties in the bankruptcy, confirmed his appointment of Judge Rosen of the District Court to serve as a mediator in the Chapter 9 case process. The mediator may bring parties together for \\"facilitative mediation\\" on any issues that Rhodes chooses to refer to mediation. Any mediation proceedings held will be confidential, except for the terms of any settlement that may be reached and presented to the bankruptcy court for approval. On August 21, Rosen - as permitted by Rhodes's order appointing him - appointed additional mediators to assist him. As Rosen said, mediation in this case will amount to a monumental task, involving \\"thousands of claims and issues.\\" The additional mediators are: U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts, a Detroit native who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan Law School; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Elizabeth Perris of the District of Oregon, who has served almost 30 years as judge and has been a judicial mediator in the Chapter 9 bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and Mammoth Lakes, Calif.; Senior U.S. District Judge Wiley Daniel of the District of Colorado, a former Detroit resident; former U.S. Bankruptcy and U.S. District Judge David Coar, who has also served as a private mediator in large bankruptcy cases, including the Mammoth Lakes, Calif., Chapter 9; and Eugene Driker, also a Detroit native, who is \\"considered a leading mediator in Michigan.\\" On August 19, the deadline set by the bankruptcy court, 109 objections were filed to Detroit's eligibility for Chapter 9. Among the more prominent objectors were the Retired City Employees Association and Joint Retired Detroit Police and Fire Fighters Association, the UAW, the AFSCME, the city's General Retirement System and Police and Fire Retirement System, the Detroit Fire Fighters Association and the Detroit Police Officers Association (and two levels of associations of higher-ranking police officers). Numerous individuals were also among those filing objections, including some in the form of handwritten letters. Attorney General Schuette filed a statement that his office does not contest Detroit's eligibility for Chapter 9, but does object, and will continue to object, to Detroit's ability through the bankruptcy process to diminish its retiree pension benefits in light of the Michigan state constitutional prohibition against impairment of these vested obligations. Notably, bondholder representatives and municipal bond insurance companies chose not to file an objection to eligibility. This is despite Kevyn Orr's stated intention to treat approximately $2 billion of general obligation bond debt as unsecured, which would likely result in substantial losses to the bond parties. Frank Schafroth, director of the Center for State and Local Leadership at George Mason University, commented that the choice not to object on eligibility reflected lessons learned in the Stockton, California, Chapter 9 case. There, bondholders and bond insurers did wage a months-long litigation effort to have Stockton declared ineligible. But this expensive and time-consuming effort proved unsuccessful. An attorney for some of the bondholders in Detroit's case commented that they felt it was better to have the bankruptcy judge as a referee rather than to deal only with Orr on the terms of his severe pre- bankruptcy proposal to the bond groups. Judge Rhodes ordered that initial argument on the purely legal issues of Detroit's eligibility for Chapter 9 be held on October 15‚Äì16, rather than the October 23 date of the full trial on eligibility. Rhodes declared early consideration of the purely legal issues, such as Detroit's authorization under state law for the bankruptcy filing, would expedite determination of eligibility under the Bankruptcy Code. At the same time, Rhodes reserved issues requiring factual determinations, such as whether Detroit negotiated in good faith with its creditors before filing the bankruptcy case, for the October 23 trial. On December 3, Judge Rhodes ruled Detroit eligible for bankruptcy protection. In his ruling the judge determined that Detroit is insolvent, and that the city could not have practically negotiated on a plan of adjustment pre-bankruptcy with its thousands of creditors. The judge declined to find that the city had negotiated in good faith with creditors pre-bankruptcy, based on the testimony at the eligibility trial; he noted that the meetings the city held with creditors leading up to the bankruptcy filing did not meet the statutory good-faith requirement. However, he found the city eligible for Chapter 9Finances.com . Finances.com, 2013. Retrieved 23 September 2014. on the statutory alternative ground of impracticability of negotiating with so many creditors. The judge also found that the city could potentially impair the pensions of city retirees through a plan under federal bankruptcy law, despite the Michigan state constitutional provision protecting such pensions from impairment. Judge Rhodes followed the announcement of his ruling in open court with a 143-page written memorandum opinion providing the bases for the ruling. The memorandum discusses in detail the financial status of the city. It reviews the statutory criteria for eligibility and indicates those the city satisfied, and finds that the city met the minimum criteria for eligibility. The memorandum discusses in depth the major objections raised by various parties to the city's eligibility, and finds that the objections are either unfounded in law or insufficient factually to deny the city eligibility for Chapter 9. The judge concluded the memorandum with a reminder to all interested parties that eligibility is only a preliminary step in a Chapter 9 case, and that the \\"ultimate objective is confirmation of a plan of adjustment....the Court strongly encourages the parties to begin to negotiate, or if they have already begun, to continue to negotiate, with a view toward a consensual plan.\\" = Appeal of eligibility ruling = Judge Rhodes declined to stay the effect of his eligibility ruling while any potential appeals are decided. He also indicated that he would consider permission for an appeal to proceed directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, rather than the regular route of an appeal first to the federal district court, in a separate motion. AFSCME immediately filed a notice of appeal of the ruling. It is expected that the independently managed pension funds for city workers will join in the appeal. Detroit's teachers' union will appeal the bankruptcy ruling according to Randi Weingarten, national president of the American Federation of Teachers. On December 16, 2013, Judge Rhodes granted motions by AFSCME and the pension funds permitting direct appeal to the Sixth Circuit. The permission includes the ruling on eligibility for Chapter 9, and the ruling that the city can impair vested public pension benefits through a Chapter 9 plan. = Fee controversy = As of October 1, 2013, Detroit had spent almost $23 million in fees to lawyers, consultants and financial advisers for the bankruptcy. Some of the fees are: *$11 million to law firm Jones Day *$4.59 million to Conway MacKenzie, a Detroit area restructuring firm *$4.17 million to Ernst & Young, accounting firm *$1.5 million to Plante Moran, accounting firm *$1.2 million to Miller Buckfire, investment banking firm Orr used $95 million earmarked for unsecured bond debt and pension payments to Detroit's restructuring initiatives, which caused Detroit to first miss bond payments in June 2013. Fees paid to three Jones Day partners who billed the city for more than $1,000 per hour of their time, as well as for trips to or from vacation homes, proved particularly controversial, but their former partner Kevyn Orr did not consider them overbilling.http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne- county/2014/12/02/bankruptcy-legal-fees/19815475/ On December 31, city officials disclosed that the city's general fund paid $164.91 million in fees relating to the bankruptcy, although they did not reveal concessions made by various parties pursuant to a mediation order, said to be worth about $25 million. The city's plan of adjustment allotted $177 million for legal and consulting fees. Disclosed fees included:http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne- county/2014/12/30/detroit-bankruptcy-fees-top/21074011/ * $57.9 million to Jones Day, * $17.28 million to Conway MacKenzie for operational restructuring * $20.22 million to Ernst & Young for financial restructuring * $22.82 million to investment banking firm Miller Buckfire, and * $15.41 million to Dentons US LLP, a law firm that acted on behalf of an official committee of city retirees fighting pension cuts * $980,000 went to two Detroit mediator firms Furthermore, the two pension funds paid attorneys at Clark Hill $6.25 million and financial advisers at Greenhill & Co. $5.71 million to fight the bankruptcy case. Judge Rhodes, whose judicial salary is set by Congress, had up to 14 days to determine whether the agreed-upon fees are reasonable. = City's plan of adjustment of debts = After the Chapter 9 eligibility ruling, emergency manager Kevyn Orr said the city will seek to file a plan for adjustment of its debts under bankruptcy law by early January. Orr said that negotiations with unions for the city's workers on the terms of a possible plan were continuing. The plan was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court in November 2014.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/us/detroit- bankruptcy-plan-ruling.html  The Grand Bargain and the end of bankruptcy  One of the biggest issues facing litigators of Detroit's bankruptcy was which assets belong to the city outright and those that were available to creditors in order to satisfy liabilities. Nowhere did this question loom larger than the fate of the Detroit Institute of Arts. The DIA holds 66,000 valuable pieces; however, only five percent of this collection was bought with city money. Judge Rhodes had to decide if the other 95% of this collection could be monetized in order to satisfy the claims of the bankruptcy creditors. In particular interest, was whether the art collection would be needed to satisfy the pension claims of its retirees. Chief Judge for the Eastern District Michigan Gerald Rosen, who had taken on the role of chief mediator, and Rhodes sought a quick end to the bankruptcy fearing a process that could take years to resolve. On November 5, 2013 Rosen convened a meeting at the federal courthouse in Detroit with the leaders of some of the largest foundations in the country. Among those in attendance were the Ford, Kresge, Knight and Mott Foundations. It was here that Rosen laid out his plan that would become known as the Grand Bargain. Rosen's plan sought commitments for over $800 million over the next 20 years from foundations, private donors, the DIA, and the state that would be used to shore up underfunded pensions. This would save the DIA from selling its art; the DIA would then become a private organization, releasing it from city ownership and protecting its collection forever. When asked why they donated, Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation said \\"If you don't have great cities, you won't have great nations,\\" he said. \\"Detroit is a metaphor for America, for America's challenges and America's opportunities. It is a hothouse for new innovation, for ingenuity and risk taking. That doesn't happen in a lot of American cities. We need to be in Detroit because of that.\\" In total foundations would commit $366 million over 20 years to the Foundation for Detroit's Future, the non-profit set up to act as the fiduciary for the funds. On December 22 Rosen rejected a $230 million settlement negotiated between the city and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS. The city owed the banks $290 million due to the investment by former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. The city and banks would settle, on the 24th, for $185 million in the Rosen-negotiated deal. Rhodes would later stun those following the proceedings, in what would be known as the Christmas Eve Massacre, when he rejected the settlement three weeks later, saying that it was \\"just too high a price to pay\\". After Orr threatened to sue the two banks, they eventually settled for $85 million. By January 2014, the city would reach a deal with some of its toughest opponents (three bond insurers) to whom they owed $388 million on the city's general obligation bonds by agreeing to pay 74%. The DIA initially offered $50 million toward the Grand Bargain; the city, governor and others pushing for the deal viewed that as too low to get the state legislature on board. Ultimately, the DIA would agree to contribute $100 million. In May 2014, legislation was introduced giving Detroit's retirement systems a $194.8 million lump sum as part of the state's $350 million commitment. If pensioners accepted the deal, they would not be able to sue the state over pension reductions; this was seen as a critical step toward getting support from the Republican-majority legislature. Some Republicans, such as Speaker of the House Jase Bolger, wanted unions to make contributions to help in the Detroit settlement. Another condition sought was that of a financial review commission modeled after the New York State Financial Control Board that oversaw New York City's troubled finances during the 1970s and 80s. After unions agreed to contribute money towards the settlement, the Michigan House passed legislation with major bipartisan support on May 22.Livengood, Chad & Gary Heinlein (May 22, 2014). Detroit's 'grand bargain' advances in Michigan Legislature The Detroit News. Governor Snyder called the legislative package an opportunity to change the direction of Detroit. The state Senate would follow on June 3 and soon after. Upon passage, the Detroit News called the final legislative package a \\"grand piece of work,\\" and the Detroit Free Press opined that the deal showed lawmakers \\"get it.\\".Detroit News Editorial Board (June 5, 2014). Editorial: Detroit's 'grand bargain' a grand piece of work The Detroit News.Detroit Free Press Editorial Board (June 4, 2014). Editorial: OK of Detroit bankruptcy deal shows Michigan lawmakers get it Detroit Free Press. In total, Judge Rosen's plan was able to raise $816 million from the various entities to create the Grand Bargain. Early in negotiations, the city's retirees saw themselves threatened with in cuts of 50%. However, with the grand bargain those cuts were reduced to a 4.5% with no cost living increases. Over the spring and summer of 2014 more than two-thirds of Detroit retirees voted in favor of the deal. On September 10, Detroit reached a deal with three Michigan counties over regional water and sewer services that could eliminate one roadblock to federal court approval of the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy. The deal with Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties created the Great Lakes Water Authority, a new regional water and sewer authority, but allowed Detroit to maintain control of its local system. The deal was crucial to adjusting the city's $18 billion of debt and helping it exit its historically unprecedented municipal bankruptcy. Detroit would reach deals with more of its creditors throughout the fall. In September it came to terms with bond insurer Syncora on its $400 million claim; Syncora would receive $25 million in cash and bonds, as well as a 20-year lease extension on their P3 operation of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and 30-year lease of the underground garage at Grand Circus Park. On October 16, lawyers for the city and Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a bond insurer with a $1 billion claim, disclosed in court that they had reached a deal to settle the company's claims. Under the deal, the city and state would pay for the demolition of the city-owned Joe Louis Arena once the Red Wings move into the new arena. After demolition, FGIC would receive the arena site and an adjacent parking lot, giving the company nearly 9 acres (3.6 ha) for redevelopment. On November 7, 2014 Judge Rhodes accepted the city's plan of adjustment, 17 months after the city had filed bankruptcy‚Äîa far shorter time frame that had been predicted based on other municipal bankruptcies. At the hearing Rhodes remarked, \\"We have used the phrase 'the Grand Bargain' to describe the group of agreements that will fix the city's pension problem. That description is entirely fitting. In our nation, we join together in the promise and in the ideal of a much grander bargain. It is the bargain by which we interact with each other and with our government, all for the common good. That grander bargain, enshrined in our Constitution, is democracy. It is now time to restore democracy to the people of the City of Detroit\\". On December 10, the ownership of DIA transferred to the non-profit DIA, Inc. The following day Detroit exited bankruptcy protection with finances returned to the control of city, subject to three years of oversight by the Detroit Financial Review Commission.

As of 2017, the exhibit features three polar bears (Hudson, Nelson, and Mishka). History In 1997, Sea World began planning and designing Polar Bear Shores. On 26 December 2000, Polar Bear Shores officially opened to the public featuring two polar bears, Ping Ping and Kanook. Following its opening, several polar bears were introduced to the exhibit while others were sent to other zoos for breeding programs. On May 9, 2013, Sea World celebrated their first polar bear birth, later revealed to be a male named Henry. Television monitors with a live stream to the maternity den were added to the exhibit shortly after. In July 2013, Sea World announced a $1.5 million expansion of Polar Bear Shores to allow Liya and her cub to be displayed separately from Nelson and Hudson. The expanded exhibit, dubbed Polar Pre-School, opened on 21 September 2013. Sculpt Studios was involved in the design of the extension. Exhibits and facilities Polar Bear Shores encompasses two public exhibits as well as back-of-house facilities. The main exhibit opened in 2000, with the secondary exhibit, dubbed Polar Pre-School opening in 2013. The public exhibits are themed to an Arctic summer. The above-water viewing deck The main public exhibit features three viewing areas: underwater, water-level and above-water. An array of educational signs are located in the viewing areas and along the paths between them. A large salt water pool encompasses much of the area with depths of between . Smaller fresh water pools also exist. A rocky environment fills the rest of the exhibit. A sprinkler system allows the simulation of rain in the covered exhibit. Five large fans, similar to those used in the production of movies, allows the wind speed to be regulated. Mist is used to reduce the air temperature. The back- of-house facilities include five dens for the polar bears to sleep in when not in the main public exhibit. This is in addition to a maternity den. There is also one exercise yard which is a smaller area containing similar elements to the main exhibit. The exhibit has a dedicated food preparation area and a keeper's office for the monitoring of the bears. An upcharge behind the scenes tour is available under Sea World's Animal Adventures program. Polar bears Since its opening in 2000, Polar Bear Shores has been home to eight different polar bears. four polar bears (Liya, Hudson, Nelson, and Mishka) live in Sea World's Polar Bear Shores. * Ping Ping was one of the original polar bears for the opening of the exhibit in 2000, having been transported from Beijing Zoo in China. Ping Ping was brought to Sea World with the hope that he would mate with Kanook. However, it never eventuated as Kanook was put down in 2004 due to kidney failure and Ping Ping was returned to Beijing Zoo. * Kanook was one of the original polar bears for the opening of the exhibit in 2000, having been transported from Reid Park Zoo in Arizona. Kanook was brought to Sea World with the hope that she would mate with Ping Ping. In April 2003, Kanook was diagnosed with kidney failure. Her condition deteriorated in 2004 and she was subsequently put down. * Liya was brought to Sea World as a cub in 2001, with her twin brother Lutik. The two were born in captivity at Leningrad Zoo in Russia. Nelson made several unsuccessful attempts at breeding with Liya from 2008, however, in 2012 Liya was showing signs of a pregnancy. In May 2013, Liya gave birth to two cubs, one of which survived. Liya gave birth to a second litter of twins in April 2017. Unfortunately only one cub survived from that litter also. On the evening of 28 December 2019 Liya died unexpectedly. * Lutik was brought to Sea World as a cub in 2001, with his twin sister Liya. The two were born in captivity at Leningrad Zoo in Russia. In 2006, Lutik had reached sexual maturity and was relocated Alaska Zoo where he was paired with a female for mating. * Hudson is the twin brother of Nelson. The two were found abandoned by their parents in the Arctic at approximately 4 months of age. Zoo Sauvage de St-F√©licien in Quebec rescued the pair as they were not expected to survive in the wilderness alone. They were relocated to Sea World in late 2004. Keepers believe that Hudson was the father of Liya's second litter of cubs. * Nelson is the twin brother of Hudson. The two were found abandoned by their parents in the Arctic at approximately 4 months of age. Zoo Sauvage de St-F√©licien in Quebec rescued the pair as they were not expected to survive in the wilderness alone. They were relocated to Sea World in late 2004. Nelson was paired with Liya for mating, with a successful birth in 2013. * Henry was born at Polar Bear Shores in May 2013 with Liya and Nelson as the parents. A second cub was born, however, Liya devoted her efforts to just one cub. The cub took its first steps in July 2013 and went on public exhibition in September 2013. Henry was moved to Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat in Canada on October 7, 2015 at 2 years of age, where he will be placed into an international breeding program when he reaches sexual maturity at 6 years old. * Mishka was born at Polar Bear Shores in late April 2017 to Liya with Hudson suspected to be the father by the keepers. Once again, Liya had twins, and devoted her efforts to just one cub after nine days. Mishka was placed onto public exhibition at 4 and a half months old on September 9, 2017.

The series primarily centers on the career of a producer who works with a group of prospective pop idols at the talent agency 765 Production. Originally released as an arcade game in 2005, the franchise has grown to numerous ports, sequels and spin-offs across multiple video game consoles, including several social network games. The series includes a variety of other media such as anime, printed media, audio dramas, a Korean drama, and radio shows. Common elements =Plot and themes= Cast of The Idolmaster The central aspect of the plot for The Idolmaster deals with the training of prospective pop idols on their way to stardom. The main talent agency featured in the series is 765 Production (765 Pro), a rising studio located in a small office. Other studios include 876 Production (876 Pro), 961 Production (961 Pro), 346 Production (346 Pro), 315 Production (315 Pro) and 283 Production (283 Pro). At 765 Pro, there are initially 10 idols the player can choose: Haruka Amami, Chihaya Kisaragi, Yukiho Hagiwara, Yayoi Takatsuki, Ritsuko Akizuki, Azusa Miura, Iori Minase, Makoto Kikuchi, and Ami and Mami Futami (who work as a pair). Three additional idols later added to 765 Pro include: Miki Hoshii, Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shij≈ç. A recurring theme in the series emphasizes the struggles an idol must go through to achieve stardom. This is indicated by the level of an idol's tension meter. Games in the series also explore relationships between characters, ranging from the relationship that develops between an idol and a producer, to the rivalry between idols and production studios. =Gameplay= In the main series of games, the player usually assumes the role of a producer who is put in charge of one or more idols as a part of a raising simulation. The player is initially put in charge of a single idol, but this can increase to more idols once the player gains enough experience as a producer. The player starts by arranging the idol's daily schedule, which gives the player a large amount of freedom on what the idol does, including giving the idol the day off. The schedule includes time for the producer to communicate with the idol, take them to jobs, train them during lessons, and offer directions during auditions and performances until they reach the top spot in the entertainment industry. However, the schedule choices in the original arcade game are limited to doing a lesson or taking an audition. Training an idol has the player going through a variety of lessons in the form of minigames. These lessons serve to increase an idol's statistics in vocal, dance and visual image. The number and type of lessons change over the series; for example, there are five in the original arcade game, six in The Idolmaster SP, and three in The Idolmaster 2. The other aspect of the game which increases an idol's statistics depends on their costumes and accessories. In the communication phase between the producer and an idol, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from over the course of a conversation and the player is given a limited amount of time to make a choice, though the player can pause the game to be given more time. Depending on which choice is made will affect how well or poorly the communication is received. As mutual trust builds between idol and producer, good memories are formed which help the idol in auditions. In contrast, if bad memories are formed through poor communication, this will adversely affect an idol. This communication is further expanded in The Idolmaster SP with the introduction of a promise system. The communication phase is supplemented by the idol taking on various jobs to further her exposure and gain fans. The audition phase is the main way for an idol to climb the idol rankings by gaining fans. The audition process involves another series of minigames, which allow the player to appeal to the judges or audience by earning points in the vocal, dance and visual categories. If an idol passes the audition, she is chosen to do a televised public performance. In later games, during the performance, the player is able to influence the idol by giving directions. The same gameplay in the audition process is also used during live concerts and festivals. The player can check the idol's rank, how many fans she has gained, and how much her singles have sold. Game series =Early years= The Idolmaster, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on July 26, 2005 as an arcade game using Namco Bandai Games' Namco System 246 arcade system board. Developed by Metro, it introduced many gameplay and plot themes common to the franchise. The player assumes the role of a novice producer who works with prospective pop idols through lessons, auditions and performances. The player can also develop a relationship between an idol and her producer. The game uses the touchscreen Rewritable Stage arcade cabinet, which issues the player two rewritable cards containing the player's profile and save data. It also makes use of the ALL.Net network service to keep track of national idol rankings. The network was discontinued on September 1, 2010, though a few of the arcade cabinets still survive. A port of the arcade game for the Xbox 360 was released on January 25, 2007. This version introduced an additional idol, Miki Hoshii, and includes new songs. The port makes use of Xbox Live, and the game has been credited with making Japan's ratio of sign-ups for Xbox Live compared to the number of consoles sold as the world's highest. Over four times as many Microsoft points were sold on the date of The Idolmasters Xbox 360 release as on the date before it. A sequel to the arcade game titled The Idolmaster Live For You! for the Xbox 360 was released on February 28, 2008. In Live For You!, the player assumes the role of a \\"special producer\\" due to the sudden absence of the original producer and is charged with coordinating the idols' concerts. The game focuses mainly on the concert coordination aspect of the original and expands on it in many ways, with higher customization of the stage, costumes and songs. Live For You! also introduced a rhythm game aspect into the series, incorporating it as a minigame during an idol's concert. A collection containing both The Idolmaster and Live For You! was released on March 12, 2009 as The Idolmaster Twins. A game titled The Idolmaster SP for the PlayStation Portable was released in three versions on February 19, 2009 titled Perfect Sun, Missing Moon and Wandering Star. SP re- introduces Miki Hoshii as a rival idol working for the 961 Pro studio, and introduces the new characters Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shij≈ç, also working for 961. Hibiki is in Perfect Sun, Miki is in Missing Moon, and Takane is in Wandering Star. SP also introduces a multiplayer mode for up to three players where each of the players' idols can interact and audition together. A slot machine titled The Idolmaster Live in Slot! was released on May 23, 2012 by Sammy using the Xbox 360 version of The Idolmaster as its motif. =2nd Vision= In May 2009, the franchise's next stage called \\"2nd Vision\\" was announced, which was described as The Idolmasters next project that would further expand the series' world. The first 2nd Vision game is The Idolmaster Dearly Stars for the Nintendo DS and was released on September 17, 2009. Instead of playing the role of a producer, the player portrays one of the three idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter 876 Pro. In addition to the story mode, the game also features a cheering mode for up to 16 players, and includes wi-fi functionality. The idols from previous The Idolmaster games make appearances in Dearly Stars as already established and popular idols. Another sequel to the original arcade game titled The Idolmaster 2 was released for the Xbox 360 on February 24, 2011 and later for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) on October 27, 2011. Set in the same universe as Dearly Stars six months after The Idolmaster, the player can choose between most of same idols in addition to Miki, Hibiki and Takane. In The Idolmaster 2, Azusa Miura, Iori Minase and Ami Futami now form an independent unit with Ritsuko Akizuki as their producer. A nine-volume fan disc series titled The Idolmaster Gravure For You! was released for the PS3 from October 27, 2011 to June 28, 2012. Gravure For You! allows the player to give the idols directions while taking gravure photos of them in various poses, costumes and locations. On October 25, 2012, The Idolmaster Shiny Festa was released for the PlayStation Portable in three versions. Like The Idolmaster SP, the different versions‚Äîtitled Honey Sound, Funky Note and Groovy Tune‚Äîfeature different idols from The Idolmaster 2 to work with. Shiny Festa is a rhythm game, and unlike previous games does not feature any raising simulation gameplay. The Shiny Festa games were released on iOS and localized into English on April 22, 2013. The titles of the games were changed for the port: Honey Sound became Harmonic Score, Funky Note became Rhythmic Record and Groovy Tune became Melodic Disc. An app for the PS3 titled Imas Channel was released on the PlayStation Network on October 2, 2013. The app includes a Shiny TV component which features a PS3 version of Shiny Festa, and the nine Gravure For You! fan discs can also be downloaded via the app. The game The Idolmaster One For All was released on May 15, 2014 for the PS3 and allows players to produce all 13 idols from 765 Pro. A game titled The Idolmaster Platinum Stars for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) was released on July 28, 2016. The Idolmaster Stella Stage was released for the PS4 on December 20, 2017. The Idolmaster Starlit Season, a crossover game featuring idols from the original series, Cinderella Girls, Million Live! and Shiny Colors, was originally planned to release in 2020 for the PS4 and Windows via Steam, but was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Social network games and spin-offs= The first social network game in the series, The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls, was released on the Mobage browser game platform for feature phones on November 28, 2011, and for iOS and Android devices on December 16, 2011. The game features a card battle system and over 100 additional idols, including the 13 idols from 765 Pro. In September 2012, the Nikkei Shimbun reported that Cinderella Girls earns over 1 billion yen in revenue monthly. The second social network game, The Idolmaster Million Live!, was released on February 27, 2013 on the GREE browser game platform for iOS and Android devices, and feature phones sold by au, NTT DoCoMo and SoftBank. Like Cinderella Girls, the game features a card battle system and another 37 additional idols, which also includes the 13 idols from 765 Pro. GREE officially ended the service on March 19, 2018. A successor game to The Idolmaster Million Live! titled The Idolmaster Million Live! Theater Days was released on June 29, 2017. The game features all 37 Million Live! idols from the preceding game and the 13 765 Pro idols, but also introduces two brand new idols, bringing it up to a total of 52 playable and produceable idols. The third social network game, The Idolmaster SideM, was released on February 28, 2014 on the Mobage platform for mobile devices. The game features a card battle system similar to the other social network games, but instead focuses on male idols at the talent agency 315 Production, which also includes the three idols formerly from 961 Production. A rhythm game with 3D models titled The Idolmaster SideM: Live On Stage! was released August 17, 2017. The Idolmaster Shiny Colors was released for Bandai Namco and Drecom's enza platform for HTML5 games on April 24, 2018. An app version was released for iOS and Android on March 13, 2019. The game is an idol raising simulator similar in style to the original games but with no rhythm game elements. This game features a completely new cast, including 23 idols and 3 employees at 283 Production (including the producer). Development The Idolmaster arcade game cabinet =Origin= In the early 2000s, there were arcade games already in use that allowed players to save their progress on magnetic stripe cards so as to continue playing later. In 2001, Namco designer Akihiro Ishihara chose to create an arcade game that used that technology. Ishihara wanted to make a game that would make players want to come back to play every day, which would be tied to the growth of video arcades. Ishihara realized that players would need an emotional attachment to the game for them to play it every day. With the target audience to be male players, Ishihara thought that a raising simulation where players could befriend girls and young women would lead players to form a strong emotional attachment for the game. Next, in order to effectively use the competitive culture that surrounds video arcades, Ishihara thought about various themes for the game, including professional wrestling and volleyball. Ishihara finally settled on a game featuring pop idols, who players would raise and compete against other players' idols to reach the top of the entertainment industry. There were some members of Namco that thought it would feel awkward to play The Idolmaster in public and that it would not be well received by players. However, when the game was first tested in arcades, there were long lines of people waiting to play. As word spread and its popularity grew, rival game companies said they had wanted to be the first to create a game like The Idolmaster. Following the success of the arcade game, Namco Bandai Games went on to develop its Xbox 360 port starting in early 2006, though a port of the game had been discussed as early as May 2005. Namco Bandai Games producer Y≈çz≈ç Sakagami was initially unsure if The Idolmaster would be suited for a video game console due to hardware and network limitations, but he felt that the Xbox 360 and its Xbox Live network could handle the game's specifications. This would also allow the developers to improve the game's quality and attract attention from those who never played the arcade game. Many people who were interested in the arcade game but never played it would tell Sakagami that this was either because their local arcade did not have The Idolmaster, or because they were embarrassed to play it in public. According to Sakagami, to the development team of the port, there was a large significance in correcting these issues. Their other focus was on allowing players to comfortably play the game and enjoy its various scenarios without the rushed gameplay found in the arcade version. Certain gameplay elements were changed in the port, and this approach to improving and supplementing gameplay elements has continued throughout the series. =Design and graphics= Most of the core design staff for each game is different, but there are several staff members who have worked for multiple games in the series. The arcade game was directed by Akihiro Ishihara, who also directed The Idolmaster SP and The Idolmaster 2, the latter of which he shared directorship with Masataka Kat≈ç. The director for the Xbox 360 port of The Idolmaster is Hiroyuki Onoda. Several returning scenario writers for the series include: Sh≈çgo Sakamoto, Tomoyo Takahashi, Emi Tanaka, Yoshihito Azuma, and Akihiro Ishihara. The original character design was handled by Toshiyuki Kubooka up to The Idolmaster SP. After that, Kiyotaka Tamiya based the character design used in The Idolmatser Dearly Stars and later games on Kubooka's designs. The graphics of the original arcade game were limited by the Namco System 246 arcade game board released in 2001, which is compatible with a PlayStation 2. Since the arcade game, characters have been rendered using 3D graphics with pre-rendered backgrounds, except during auditions and performances which use a full 3D environment. The developers employ motion capture to present a realistic view of the characters‚Äînot only during normal gameplay, but also during performances, which are rendered using motion capture from professional dancers. When developing the Xbox 360 port of The Idolmaster, the characters had to be entirely redone, including the motion capture, which used the same actors as before. Further details were able to be added to the character designs because of the Xbox 360's improved, high- definition hardware. =Music= The titles in the series feature a variety of music sung by the idols, many of which are featured in multiple games either initially or as downloadable content. The original arcade game has 10 songs, and this is increased to 16 in the Xbox 360 port, as it includes 6 new songs. More songs have continued to be introduced in later games, which include: five in The Idolmaster Live For You!, five in The Idolmaster SP, four in The Idolmaster Dearly Stars, 13 in The Idolmaster 2, and four in The Idolmaster Shiny Festa.

The Xbox 360 port of The Idolmaster was awarded the special prize at the 2007 Japan Game Awards partially for its unique take on raising simulation games at the time. The Xbox 360 port of The Idolmaster sold 25,000 copies in its first week of sale and was the fifteenth best selling console video game in Japan for the time of its release. The Idolmaster Live For You! would see better success, selling 44,000 units in its first week of sales as the fifth best selling console video game in Japan. In their first week of sales, the three versions of The Idolmaster SP sold 129,088 units. The Idolmaster Dearly Stars sold 30,786 in its first week of sales. The Idolmaster 2 for the Xbox 360 was voted one of the most anticipated future game at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show by attendees. Despite this, the Xbox 360 version of the game initially sold 34,621 units and was the tenth best selling console video game in Japan for the time of its release, but the PlayStation 3 version sold 65,512 units in its first week. The three versions of The Idolmaster Shiny Festa sold 119,132 units in their first week of sales. The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls earned more than per month ( annually) in Japan during 2012.

The Idolmaster merchandise grossed () in Japan retail sales during 2007. =Critical reception= The raising simulation system in the series has been described as simple and easy to understand, and the various minigames have been described as \\"addictive\\". However, the audition system in later games such as The Idolmaster 2 has been called strategically weaker, but at the same time easier to understand than previous games. As the series progressed, the improved realism in the idol's expressions, movements and manner of speaking was praised. As the first handheld release, The Idolmaster SP was praised as satisfying the needs of the fans who enjoy \\"lovingly raising their favorite idols\\" at all times. Overall, an enjoyable aspect of the series has been cited as deepening one's relationship with \\"cute and individualistic\\" idols while going through the ups and downs of the story. The introduction of rivals into The Idolmaster SP was described as effectively giving each game a different impression, and competing against rivals in the series has been praised. While one reviewer for Famitsu suggested it was natural to identify with the idols when watching them perform, a different reviewer in the same magazine issue stated that the game would be somewhat tiresome if the player did not have an emotional attachment to a given idol. However, another reviewer noted that it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story is told from the perspective of the idols in The Idolmaster Dearly Stars. Although, because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. Early aspects of the series were criticized as presenting a narrow and unrealistic view of the idol world. =Appearances in other games= Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, another Xbox 360 game developed and published by Namco, references The Idolmaster in special paint schemes for the Su-33 Flanker, F-117A Night Hawk, F-16C Fighting Falcon, F-2A Viper Zero, Su-47 Berkut, F-15E Strike Eagle, Rafale M, Mirage 2000-5, Typhoon, F-14D Tomcat and F-22A Raptor as part of downloadable packs of extra aircraft colors made available for purchase between November 22, 2007 and March 31, 2008.

Ace Combat: Assault Horizon as well as the Ridge Racer series on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360 also include DLC for The Idolmaster series. Bandai Namco Entertainment and Aniplex has allowed third party companies and organizations to use the franchise's characters in their promotions both individually or as a group. Miki Hoshii was named the store manager of Tower Records' Japanese branches on March 21, 2011 at the retailer's Shinjuku branch. In 2012, the Tokyo Shrine Agency distributed posters and pamphlets featuring the 765 Production idols as part of a campaign to attract hatsum≈çde visitors.

Your Pie provides customizable 10-inch pizzas, build-your-own panini sandwiches, and bread bowl salads. Your Pie uses brick ovens to cook pizzas at a high temperature for a short amount of time. Gelato (Italian ice cream), craft beer and wine are also available. The interior d√©cor differs from store to store, but all locations blend \\"old Italian\\" style with a modern, artistic approach. History Founder Drew French worked in the kitchens of many franchise brands throughout his college career. In May 2006, French vacationed with his wife to the island of Ischia for their honeymoon, an Italian island off the coast of Naples, where his wife's family is from. It was here where the concept for Your Pie began. Brick oven pizza was everywhere in Ischia. Noticing how quickly custom, artisan pies could be made through using a brick oven, French's idea for a build-it-yourself, quick- serve pizza place came to be. Customization Customers begin by selecting which hand-tossed dough will be used for their customized pizza. Following the down-the-line concept, customers then select which homemade sauce to put on the dough, and then choose which all-natural cheese will go on the pizza. Your Pie provides 35 ingredients to top pizzas with before the pizza is cooked. An alternative option is to choose from Your Pie's signature pies. There are seven \\"Favorites\\" that remain on Your Pie's menu year round as well as a signature craft pizza. Awards and accolades In March 2013, Entrepreneur Magazine listed Your Pie as #66 in a list of Top New Franchises. In June 2013, 1851 Magazine also selected Your Pie as one of 64 Restaurants To Watch for the year. In October 2015, Your Pie's Peach Prosciutto craft series pizza was selected as the East Coast Pizza Championship winner.

The district, the second largest in the state in terms of square miles, includes a wide swath of twenty-two counties. Early life and education Springer graduated from Weatherford High School in 1985 He then earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from the University of North Texas.  Career  A businessman, Springer is a former controller of a railcar company. He thereafter was a manager of three companies with a total of more than 1,000 employees. In 2005, he joined his father in business in the financial services industry. Springer was first elected in 2012 when the incumbent Republican, Rick Hardcastle of Vernon, stepped down after fourteen years in office because of multiple sclerosis. Springer was appointed to the Agriculture and Livestock and the Land and Resource Management committees. It initially appeared that Springer had lost the 2012 Republican primary election in a heavily rural district, when his chief opponent, Trent McKnight, finished with 49 percent of the vote. However, in the runoff election on July 31, with backing from two eliminated candidates in the primary, Springer topped McKnight, 8,434 (56.4 percent) to 6,521 (43.6 percent). Springer was unopposed in the 2012 general election in his heavily Republican district. Springer noted that McKnight is a former Democrat who had never voted in a Republican primary election until his own race in 2012. The winner in eighteen of the twenty-two counties, McKnight blamed his loss on a high turnout in Cooke County, where there was also a competitive election for sheriff, and low participation in the counties in which McKnight led in the primary, despite the high-profile U.S. Senate primary between David Dewhurst and Ted Cruz. In addition to Cooke, Springer won in neighboring Montague as well as Garza and Floyd counties. In 2013, Springer joined the large Republican majority in the Texas House in enacting H.B. 2 to restrict abortion. Springer co-sponsored the legislation. The legislation was subsequently struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt.Adam Liptak, Supreme Court Strikes Down Texas Abortion Restrictions, New York Times (June 28, 2016).  Personal life  He and his wife, Lydia, who married in 1991, have three children.

The hills range from an elevation of over in the southeastern section, to the range's high point of in elevation, in the northwestern section. The Clevelin Hills are named for the leading developers of the Clevelin Corporation (Henry Cleveland Schultz and Abe Corlinsky) in the 1920s.Riverside Chronicles, November 2019, P16-37 These hills feature historic Clevelin Spanish-Mediterranean homes (designed by Architects Dickman & Simmons) and adorned with Hopi-inspired features and Italianate gardens (designed by Landscape Architect, Otto Gutkaes). Hundreds of Marbelite lampposts designed by mineral engineer and inventor, Henry Barkschat, have stood for over 100 years. These lampposts are constructed of centrifugally dried cement laden with sparkling white San Bernardino granite. Each evening the lamps on Lakeshore Drive illuminate what was once the Clevelin subdivision's lake front. Geology The Clevelin Hills are the horst, on the edge of the Perris Block, thrown up on the northeast side of the graben of the Elsinore Valley, close to the shore of Lake Elsinore, along the Glen Ivy Fault.Rene Engel, Geology and Mineral Deposits of the Lake Elsinore Quadrangle California, California Department of Natural Resources, Bulletin 146, Division of Mines, San Francisco, 1959, pp. 16‚àí25 The Clevelin Hills are composed of a number of different rock formations. In the southeast along the Lake Elsinore shore they are composed of Triassic Santa Ana Formation and Jurassic dacite and gabbro. To the northeast they are composed mostly of Lower Pleistocene or older fanglomerate underlain by Cretaceous grandiorite. There are exposures of Eocene Martinez Formation on its southwest slopes and northeast slopes. Some Santa Ana Formation rocks are found on the northwest end of the range, and at Canyon Lake.

Its type strain is JCM 7371 (= GIFU 9882). It is notable for degrading a variety of aromatic compounds including biphenyl, naphthalene, phenanthrene, toluene, m-, and p-xylene. S. yanoikuyae was discovered by Brian Goodman on the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. However, Sphingomonas have a wide distribution across freshwater, seawater, and terrestrial habitats. This is due to the bacteria‚Äôs ability to grow and survive under low-nutrient conditions as it can utilize a broad range of organic compounds.  Microbiologic Characteristics  Mature S. yanoikuyae cells typically consist of short rod-shaped groups that are 0.3-0.8¬µm by 1.0-2.7¬µm in dimension and form yellow-pigmented colonies. This bacterium is unique among Gram-negative bacteria because it lacks endotoxin carrier lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and instead has a cell membrane made up of phospholipids, proteins, and respiratory quinones, and an outer membrane containing glycosphingolipids (GSLs). This makes S. yanoikuyae more hydrophobic in comparison to other Gram-negative bacteria. Moving onto metabolism, since S. yanoikuyae is a chemoheterotroph, it primarily derives its energy from chemicals and other organisms. S. yanoikuyae has the ability to metabolize a wide variety of different carbon sources, such as L-arabinose, D-xylose, galactose, Salicin, mannose, D-turanose, and caprate. S. yanoikuyae primarily uses glucose to encourage growth, but also uses other sugars such as arabinose, galactose, mannose, fucose, lactose, xylose, trehalose, melibiose, and sucrose. More so, the bacteria obtains energy from sources like Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), biphenyl, naphthalene, phenanthrene, toluene, and m-/p-xylene.  Environment  Due to S. yanoikuyae‚Äôs ability to survive in conditions of low concentrations of nutrients, this bacteria has been found in various environments, ranging from terrestrial to aqueous habitats. Not only this, but S. yanoikuyae has also been found in a few locations contaminated by toxic compounds, such as pentachlorophenol, PCBs, herbicides, and creosote, and immediately displayed their versatility when researchers discovered that it utilized one or more of the contaminants as their carbon sources. Additionally, S. yanoikuyae can degrade monosaccharides, polysachharides, and disaccharides. In regards to their unique bio-degradative and biosynthetic abilities, S. yanoikuyae are potential candidates to possibly be used in future biotechnological applications, such as bioremediation of environmental contaminants. This is significant as its metabolic mechanisms can be utilized in bioremediation and food technology. This means that while S. yanoikuyae has been found in Papua New Guinea and marine sediments off the ocean floor of the South China Sea, it will likely be cultured from its habitats and transferred to various environments.  Phenotypic and Genetic Characteristics  S. yanoikuyae‚Äôs genome size is approximately 5,353,044 base pairs, the bacteria stains Gram-negative, has a G+C content of 64.3%, and is non-motile. This bacteria has a pH optima of 6.8, but can survive in pH conditions ranging from 6.0-9.0. Additionally, its temperature optima is 28ùáàC, with a range of 13ùáàC-30ùáàC, and it is a slight halophilic (2-5% NaCl).

The language was the same as that used in China itself, as well as Korea and Japan, and used the same standard Chinese characters. It was used for official business, historical annals, fiction, verse, scholarship and even for declarations of Vietnamese determination to resist the Chinese.  Literary Chinese  Bronze cash coin, 1st century AD with ancient Seal script Literary Chinese was a style of writing modelled on the classics of Warring States period and Han dynasty, such as the Mencius, the Commentary of Zuo and Sima Qian's Historical Records. It remained largely static while the various varieties of Chinese evolved and diverged to the point of mutual unintelligibility. The language was also used for formal writing in Vietnam, Korea and Japan, enabling scholars from these countries, as well as China, to communicate in writing, in a role similar to that of Latin in Europe. Literary Chinese as written in Vietnam used the same characters and outward form as in China. Although Literary Chinese was used only for written communication, each Chinese character could be read aloud in a Vietnamese approximation of the Middle Chinese pronunciation. For example, the term for Chinese characters, Êº¢Â≠ó (H√†nz√¨ in Modern Standard Chinese) has a Sino-Vietnamese reading of H√°n t·ª±. With these pronunciations, Chinese words were imported wholesale into the Vietnamese language. The resulting Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary makes up over half the Vietnamese lexicon. The Vietnamese terms for writing in Chinese are ch·ªØ H√°n (\\"Chinese writing\\") or ch·ªØ nho (\\"Confucian writing\\") in contrast to ch·ªØ N√¥m (\\"Southern writing\\"), a script for the Vietnamese language. The N√¥m script, using a mixture of Chinese characters and locally created characters, became the vehicle for a flourishing vernacular literature, peaking in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. However Literary Chinese remained the medium of scholarship and administration for almost all of the period up to the early 20th century.  History  A 1814 printing of the survived compliance \\"ƒê·ªói tr·ª±c ng√¥n c·ª±c gi√°n\\" wrote by Jiang Gongfu in 758. X√° L·ª£i Buddhist temple stele erected in 601 CE. Temple of Literature in Hanoi, recording the names of doctoral graduates in the civil service examinations The northern part of Vietnam (down to about the 17th parallel) was incorporated into the Han empire in 111 BC, beginning a millennium of Chinese control, interrupted only by two short-lived revolts. At first the empire sought to rule their new possession indirectly through the Vietnamese nobility, but after an influx of refugees fleeing the takeover of Wang Mang (9‚Äì23 AD), policy shifted to assimilation, contributing to the revolt of the Trung sisters (39‚Äì43). After the suppression of the revolt, Chinese authorities stepped up assimilation, destroying the estates of Vietnamese nobles, but also opening Chinese education to the Vietnamese. A few rose through the civil service to senior positions in the province and elsewhere in the empire. The oldest and earliest known survived stele of Classic Chinese by the Vietnamese was erected in 601 AD in the short-independent V·∫°n Xu√¢n kingdom under pressures from Emperor Wen of Sui of Sui Empire, who attempts to vassalizing to annexing the Vietnamese kingdom. V·∫°n Xu√¢n paid tributes each two years for the Sui, but in 602, Emperor Wen ordered general Liu Fang invaded V·∫°n Xu√¢n with 100,000 soldiers. L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª≠ and L√Ω S∆∞ L·ª£i quickly surrendered and were captured to Chang'an. Sui soldiers destroyed or looted most Classic Chinese books and steles, and brought them to China. Thus started the Third Chinese domination of Vietnam which lasted until 905 CE. As in any other part of the empire, the administrative language of Vietnam was Chinese. The most notable and famous Vietnamese writers and poets during this period probably were Jiang Gongfu (730-805) and Li√™u H·ªØu Ph∆∞∆°ng (?-850), however just a fews of their poems and books are still surviving today. After the country achieved independence in 938, it continued to use Literary Chinese. At first Buddhist monks dominated government and scholarship in the country. The next extant writings by Vietnamese authors are poems from the late 10th century, in Chinese, by the Buddhist monks Lac Thuan and Khu√¥ng Vi·ªát. After three short- lived dynasties, the Ly Dynasty (1009‚Äì1225) was established with the support of Buddhist clergy. When the first king moved the capital to Hanoi in the following year, he issued the 110-character Edict on the Transfer of the Capital. Confucian influence grew over the course of the dynasty, with a Confucian Temple of Literature being erected in the capital in 1070. Civil service examinations on the Chinese model began in 1075, and in the following year a college was established for training sons of the ruling elite in the Confucian classics. When the Chinese Song empire invaded the country in 1076, the general L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát wrote a 4-line poem Mountains and rivers of the Southern country. His poem was the first of a series of statements of Vietnamese determination to resist northern invaders, all written in Literary Chinese. Later examples include * a Call to the Officers of the Army, issued in 1285 when the country was facing a Mongol invasion, * Return to the Capital, a poem celebrating the expulsion of the Mongols in 1288, * the Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu, celebrating the end of the Ming occupation in 1428, and * an Address to the Army at the time of an attempted invasion by the Qing empire in 1789. The influence of Confucian literati grew in the following Tran Dynasty (1225‚Äì1400) until they had a monopoly on public office. The first official history, the Annals of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (1272), was commissioned during this dynasty. Although this work has been lost, it served as a model for later annals, and parts of it are preserved in later annals written in Chinese, the Abbreviated Annals of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (late 14th century) and the Complete Annals of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (1479). Unofficial histories from this period include the Spirits of the Departed in the Viet Realm and the Wondrous Tales of Linh Nam, parts of which were also incorporated into the Complete Annals. The Vietnamese nationalist Phan Boi Chau (1867‚Äì1940), author of many book written in Literary Chinese. Literary Chinese remained the language of administration throughout the traditional period, except during two short- lived reformist regimes. When H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly seized the throne in 1400, as well as pursuing a programme of land reform, he sought to break the power of the Confucian literati by making Vietnamese, written in the N√¥m script, the state language and translating the classics to make them available to all. H·ªì's reforms were reversed after Ming China invaded the country. None of the N√¥m literature of the period has survived, through a combination of the Ming destruction of Vietnamese libraries and the continued prestige of Chinese works after the Ming were driven out. Similar reforms were attempted by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá from 1788, but were again reversed at the beginning of the succeeding Nguyen Dynasty (1802‚Äì1945). The shared written language made it possible for Vietnamese scholars to communicate with literate Chinese and Koreans, but only in writing; they required interpreters for verbal communication. The Vietnamese sent their best scholars as envoys to the Chinese capital, where they were to purchase the latest Chinese books and to enter poetry-writing competitions with Chinese and Korean scholars. The 18th-century triumph of L√™ Qu√Ω ƒê√¥n in such a competition became a focus of national pride. L√™ Qu√Ω ƒê√¥n is considered the last great author of Chinese literature in Vietnam. His prodigious output included a history of Vietnam, collected essays on a wide variety of topics, anthologies of verse and commentaries on the classics. Chinese characters used for decorative purposes in modern Vietnam Vietnamese intellectuals continued to write in Chinese up to the early decades of the 20th century. For example, the nationalist Phan Boi Chau (1867‚Äì1940) wrote his History of the Loss of Vietnam (1905) and other tracts in Literary Chinese, and also used it to communicate when in Japan and China, as he spoke neither Japanese nor Chinese. Writers such as Phan Boi Chau, Phan Chau Trinh and the principal of the Tonkin Free School even used Chinese to write their attacks on education in Chinese and the examination system. On the other side, the French colonial authorities were also opposed to Chinese, both because it made administration more difficult for them and because of the nationalist literature being circulated in the language. They abolished the examination system in 1913, and both Literary Chinese and Ch·ªØ n√¥m were swiftly replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet in the early 20th century. In modern Vietnam, Chinese characters are seen only singly or in stock phrases written by calligraphers.

Plot The action is set in San Francisco where the film opens in a documentary style. When the evidence in a murder case points to a young woman as the main suspect, both her boyfriend (a police detective) and a struggling songwriter who plays piano in a bar, decide to withhold evidence from the police. Both of them ostensibly act to protect the woman, who believes that she accidentally killed the victim after an attempted sexual assault. Later, the girl, knowing that the songwriter did not commit the murder, helps him to escape from a police dragnet when he becomes the main suspect. She and the songwriter fall in love and eventually compare notes about the events surrounding the murder, leading them to realize that someone else must be the culprit. The boyfriend is revealed as the actual murderer, and is arrested after he attempts to kill them to hide his guilt. Cast * Lew Ayres as John Howard Tracy * Sonny Tufts as Det.

In a heavy path decomposition, each non-leaf node selects one \\"heavy edge\\", the edge to the child that has the greatest number of descendants (breaking ties arbitrarily). The selected edges form the paths of the decomposition. Decomposition into paths If the edges of a tree T are partitioned into a set of heavy edges and light edges, with one heavy edge from each non-leaf node to one of its children, then the subgraph formed by the heavy edges consists of a set of paths, with each non- leaf vertex belonging to exactly one path, the one containing its heavy edge. Leaf nodes of the tree that are not the endpoint of a heavy edge may be considered as forming paths of length zero. In this way, each vertex belongs to exactly one of the paths. Each path has a head vertex, its topmost vertex. Alternatively, the paths of heavy edges may be extended by including one light edge, the one from the head of the path to its parent. In this variation of the decomposition, some vertices belong to multiple paths, but every edge of T belongs to exactly one path. The path tree The paths of the decomposition may themselves be organized into a tree called the \\"path tree\\", \\"heavy path tree\\", or \\"compressed tree\\". Each node of the path tree corresponds to a path of the heavy path decomposition. If p is a path of the heavy path decomposition, then the parent of p in the path tree is the path containing the parent of the head of p. The root of the path tree is the path containing the root of the original tree. Alternatively, the path tree may be formed from the original tree by edge contraction of all the heavy edges. A \\"light\\" edge of a given tree is an edge that was not selected as part of the heavy path decomposition. If a light edge connects two tree nodes x and y, with x the parent of y, then x must have at least twice as many descendants as y. Therefore, on any root-to-leaf path of a tree with n nodes, there can be at most log2 n light edges. Equivalently, the path tree has height at most log2 n. Applications Heavy path decomposition was introduced by as part of the amortized analysis of their link/cut tree structure, and by as part of their data structure for lowest common ancestors, The link/cut tree data structure uses a partition of a dynamic tree into paths that is not necessarily the heavy path decomposition; its analysis uses a potential function measuring its distance from the heavy path decomposition, and the small height of the path tree implies that each data structure operation performs only a small number of steps that cannot be charged against improvements to this function. In the lowest common ancestor data structure, the decomposition is used to embed the input tree into a complete binary tree of logarithmic depth, allowing each query to be solved by constant-time bitwise operations. Subsequent applications of heavy path decomposition have included solving the level ancestor problem, computing the edit distance between trees, graph drawing and greedy embedding, finding a path near all nodes of a given graph, fault diagnosis in fiber-optic communication networks, and decoding grammar-based codes, among others.

It allows for a quantitative depiction of bond formation when the molecular geometry deviates from ideal bond angles. Only bonding with 4 equivalent substituents results in exactly hybridization. For molecules with different substituents, we can use isovalent hybridization to rationalize the differences in bond angles between different atoms. In the molecule methyl fluoride for example, the HCF bond angle (108.73¬∞) is less than the HCH bond angle (110.2¬∞).National Institute of Standards and Technology. Listing of Experimental Data for CH3F. (accessed Feb.19, 2015). See table of Internal coordinates. This difference can be attributed to more character in the C‚àíF bonding and more character in the C‚àíH bonding orbitals. The hybridisation of bond orbitals is determined by Bent's rule: \\"Atomic s character concentrates in orbitals directed toward electropositive substituents\\". The bond length between similar atoms also shortens with increasing s character. For example, the C‚àíH bond length is 110.2 pm in ethane, 108.5 pm in ethylene and 106.1 pm in acetylene, with carbon hybridizations sp3 (25% s), sp2 (33% s) and sp (50% s) respectively. To determine the degree of hybridization of each bond one can utilize a hybridization parameter (). For hybrids of s and p orbitals, this is the coefficient (\\\\lambda)multiplying the p orbital when the hybrid orbital is written in the form (s + \\\\lambda p). The square of the hybridization parameter equals the hybridization index () of an orbital.Carroll, F. A. Perspectives on Structure and Mechanism in Organic Chemistry, 2nd ed.; John Wiley & Sons: New Jersey, 2010.Mislow, K. Introduction to Stereochemistry; W.A. Benjamin Inc: New York. 1965. n = \\\\lambda^2. The fractional s character of orbital i is \\\\frac{1}{1+ \\\\lambda_i^2}, and the s character of all the hybrid orbitals must sum to one, so that \\\\sum_{i} \\\\frac{1}{1+ \\\\lambda_i^2} = 1 The fractional character of orbital i is \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_i^2}{1+\\\\lambda_i^2} , and the p character of all the hybrid orbitals sums to the number of p orbitals involved in the formation of hybrids: :\\\\sum_{i} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_i^2}{1+\\\\lambda_i^2} = 1,2,\\\\ \\\\mathrm{or}\\\\ 3 These hybridization parameters can then be related to physical properties like bond angles. Using the two bonding atomic orbitals and we are able to find the magnitude of the interorbital angle. The orthogonality condition implies the relation known as Coulson's theorem:Coulson, C.A. Valence (2nd ed., Oxford University Press 1961) p.204 :\\\\ 1 + \\\\lambda_i \\\\lambda_j \\\\cos \\\\theta_{ij} = 0 For two identical ligands the following equation can be utilized: :\\\\ 1 + \\\\lambda_i^2 \\\\cos \\\\theta_{ii} = 0 The hybridization index cannot be measured directly in any way. However, one can find it indirectly by measuring specific physical properties. Because nuclear spins are coupled through bonding electrons, and the electron penetration to the nucleus is dependent on s character of the hybrid orbital used in bonding, J-coupling constants determined through NMR spectroscopy is a convenient experimental parameter that can be used to estimate the hybridization index of orbitals on carbon. The relationships for one-bond 13C-1H and 13C-13C coupling are :\\\\ ^1J_{^{13}\\\\mathrm{C}-^{1}\\\\mathrm{H}} = \\\\frac {500\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz}}{1 + \\\\lambda_i^2}= (500\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz})\\\\chi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(i) and \\\\ ^1J_{^{13}\\\\mathrm{C}-^{13}\\\\mathrm{C}} = (550\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz}) \\\\Big(\\\\frac {1}{1 + \\\\lambda_i^2}\\\\Big)\\\\Big(\\\\frac {1}{1 + \\\\lambda_j^2}\\\\Big)= (550\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz})\\\\chi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(i)\\\\chi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(j), where 1JX-Y is the one-bond NMR spin-spin coupling constant between nuclei X and Y and œáS(Œ±) is the s character of orbital Œ± on carbon, expressed as a fraction of unity. As an application, the 13C-1H coupling constants show that for the cycloalkanes, the amount of s character in the carbon hybrid orbital employed in the C-H bond decreases as the ring size increases. The value of 1J13C-1H for cyclopropane, cyclobutane and cyclopentane are 161, 134, and 128 Hz, respectively. This is a consequence of the fact that the C-C bonds in small, strained rings (cyclopropane and cyclobutane) employ excess p character to accommodate their molecular geometries (these bonds are famously known as 'banana bonds'). In order to conserve the total number of s and p orbitals used in hybridization for each carbon, the hybrid orbital used to form the C-H bonds must in turn compensate by taking on more s character.Anslyn, A.V., Dougherty, D.A. Modern Physical Organic Chemistry 3rd ed; University Science: California. 2006.Ferguson, L.N. Highlights of Alicyclic Chemistry, Part 1; Franklin Publishing Company, Inc.: Palisade, NJ, 1973. Experimentally, this is also demonstrated by the significantly higher acidity of cyclopropane (pKa ~ 46) compared to, for instance, cyclohexane (pKa ~ 52).

Cuneo was very successful in races against both male and female racers until the racing associations restricted races to men only. She was a strong advocate for women drivers and an advocate for the Good Roads Movement in the United States. She first became famous as a daring automobilist in 1905, after her marriage to Andrew Cuneo in 1898 and the birth of her two children, Antonio (A. Newton Cuneo (1899) and Maddalena (Dolly) Cuneo (1901). Between 1905 and 1912 she would enjoy national celebrity because of her success as a daring racer willing to compete against all comers, both male and female.Unfortunately after women were banned from organized racing, she was no longer able to race and was reduced to setting women's speed records. After her husband's scandalous involvement with a showgirl, they divorced. Joan Cuneo then moved away from New York City where she had lived with her husband and children, first to Vermont and then to the upper peninsula of Michigan. There she married James Francis Sickman, her childhood sweetheart, shortly before her death. Until recently, she had received only a brief mention in automotive history \\"as the woman who got women banned from racing.\\"  Early life  Joan Cuneo was the last of four daughters born to Leila Vulte and John Carter Newton in Holyoke, Massachusetts. By the standards of the time, John Newton, a self-made millionaire, treated Cuneo more like a son than a daughter. He allowed her to drive a steam train and a six horse team. She became an expert horsewoman and bicyclist. As Cuneo grew older, her parents sent her to several boarding schools, reportedly to become a Victorian lady. In 1898, Cuneo married Andrew Cuneo, the adopted son of millionaire banker Antonio Cuneo. The couple had two children, Antonio and Maddalena, in the first three years of their marriage. In 1902, their relationship began to change when Andrew Cuneo bought his wife a 1902 Locomobile. Cuneo soon became interested in racing.Nystrom, Elsa A.

In addition, she had learned much about the mechanical side of an automobile, as her husband had hired young Louis Disbrow as her mechanic/chauffeur. Disbrow was a neighbor who had recently escaped conviction for murder but he came from a good family and had experience with autos, as his brothers owned a nearby automobile agency. For the next 4 years, he would be his wife's riding mechanic, going with her to many races, as well as on three Glidden Tours. Andrew Cuneo also went along to many of these events but he would often leave after a few days to attend to his business affairs. By 1905, the New York papers were full of automobile related events. One of the most talked about was the Glidden Tour, a brain child of Colonel Jasper Glidden, intended to popularize the auto while proving its reliability on a strenuous tour of several states on the difficult, unpaved roads of the time. Cuneo, only 5'2\\" and already an experienced driver, was eager to participate and sent in her application. It was promptly rejected by the AAA, the sanctioning body for the tour, because only male drivers were allowed.

At least four other Whites were entered in the tour, including one driven by Walther White, the president of the company. Cuneo was enjoying the first day's drive when she saw the car in front of her, inexplicably stop and start to back-up at the entrance to a narrow bridge. There were no brake lights in 1905. Cuneo tried to evade the car but there was little room to maneuver; the wheels of the White ran off the bridge, and the car and its passengers fell off the bridge and landed in the stream bed below. The White was a sturdy machine and started up after it was righted by nearby spectators and workmen. Its passengers suffered only bruises and were unfazed by their experience. Cuneo was able to drive her car up out of the ditch and the foursome continued on their way. However, the battered White eventually gave out on the final day of the tour despite repairs by a local blacksmith. Cuneo's accident, however, made headlines throughout the Northeast and would actually launch her career as a racer.The Glidden Tour, Horseless Age, Vol. 16, 16 July 1905, p154.http://wwwVmcca.org/BH1905.HTML 1905 Glidden Tour, University of Arizona Special Collections, p2 accessed 3/5/2010http://library.uml.edu/clh/Auto02.htm Center for Lowell History - University of Massachusetts Lowell, libraries, \\"The early automobile in Lowell,) p7.  Her first races  Shortly after the Cuneos got back to their Long Island home, several newspapers contacted Joan Cuneo and encouraged her to enter a competition being held on the beach at Atlantic City, NJ. She immediately shipped her car to the beach and came in second in a one-mile race on Labor Day weekend. She knew she could do better and jumped at the chance to race at the Duchess County Fair held at Poughkeepsie NY later that month. This was her first attempt at track racing, as she said later, \\"I had my first experience at track racing...it was a case of love at first sight and my love for track racing grew each time I drove around one.\\" It was here that she met Barney Oldfield for the first time. Her experience at Poughkeepsie was somewhat frustrating. She was disappointed with her slow time of 1:22:5 for an exhibition mile to set a new women's record, and she was unable to finish the 5-mile handicap race she had entered (competing against male drivers) as she had car trouble. Ironically, after fixing the car, she was arrested for speeding on the way home.Poughkeepsie Unity Eagle, Saturday, 30 September 1905.  Setting speed records  In 1905, many male drivers, including Barney Oldfield and Ralph De Palma drew crowds at local tracks when they attempted to set a new speed record for one, five, or even ten miles. Cuneo was often limited to exhibition runs because of her sex but she also gained fame by setting a number of speed records. Unlike Dorothy Levitt, her British contemporary who drove factory prepared cars, Joan always drove her own personal cars, although they were stripped down to the bare essentials for racing. After women were banned from racing, several of her male competitors trusted her to drive their race cars in order to set yet another women's speed record. In 1906, she would continue to hone her skills at a variety of tracks, usually one-half to one mile flat dirt ovals, used for horse-racing. There were no purpose-built automobile race tracks until the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was completed in 1909, both in attempts at speed records and in competition. She also competed in popular amateur automobile events called gymkhanas. These were obstacle course events for cars instead of horses. Drivers had to drive around and over obstacles and inclines, sometimes in reverse. At the Danbury Fair in 1906, Cuneo was driving full speed in a gymkhana with two women passengers when the car caught on fire. The passengers bailed out the back of the car but she calmly shut off the engine and turned off the gas before jumping out. Although she suffered painful burns and singed hair, she shrugged off the event as nothing unusual.Woman Stops Blazing Auto, New York Times, 3 October 1906. Cuneo had become an experienced driver who could muscle a car without power steering and minimal suspension and brakes on the horrible roads of the time as well as rough dirt tracks. IN 1907, she finished third in a hundred-mile race in a time of two hours and 23 minutes; no mean feat for an any woman in a brass age car. Many who interviewed her were surprised to meet a small woman with a steady gaze and low voice instead of a powerful Amazon.Sloss, Robert \\"What a woman can do with an auto,\\" Outing Magazine, Vol. 56, 1910, p64. As she gained skill as a driver, she also was more involved in the care and maintenance of her cars. Cuneo believed that in the years since she had learned to drive, autos had improved mechanically, and the main problem now was blow-outs. The tires of that era had little resemblance to those of today; all had a tube as well as an outer casing and were time-consuming to change. It would take many years before tires caught up to mechanical improvements. Cuneo also longed for a self-starter. As she said, \\"It took both knack and strength and one can tell only by one's automobile sense whether more knack or more strength is needed at the precise moment.\\"  Mardi Gras Races  In the summer of 1908, Cuneo reached the high point both of her racing career and celebrity. She completed the 1908 Glidden Tour with a perfect score, set more speed records and had her entry accepted for a number of races to be held at the New Orleans Fair Grounds track in February 1909. The promoters of these races hoped to add one or two women's events to create additional publicity. What they didn't realize was that Cuneo intended to enter almost all the races, including those supposed to be for males only. When the time came, they did not forbid her to race, perhaps because no other women showed up to compete against her. As a result, during the course of the three-day event, she defeated some of the leading male racers including Bob Burman and George Robertson, and finished second to Ralph De Palma in a fifty- mile race. De Palma was the best racer of the day. The resulting flurry of news articles trumpeting her success came just as the Contest Board of the American Automobile Association had decided to ban women from any competition they sanctioned, including the Glidden Tours. Although she was furious, there was little she could do. The men of the Contest Board, most of whom she knew well, turned her away whenever she tried to enter an AAA event. Although never a vocal proponent of women's rights, Cuneo felt strongly that women should be allowed to compete if they had the ability and desire, and she had already demonstrated that she had plenty of both. Although she thought of taking the Contest Board to court, she realized it would be futile as its male officials had closed ranks against her.  Life after banishment  Alice H. Ramsey and Joan N. Cuneo, from a 1909 publication. After the new rules went into effect, Cuneo still competed in events that were not sanctioned by the AAA, and set several \\"unofficial\\" women's speed records. She wrote articles on motoring for magazines and was a valued spokesperson for the Good Roads movement as well as orphans' charities in New York. However, she would never again have the opportunity to do what she wanted most: compete against the best male drivers of the time. The years of opportunity had slipped by; she was close to forty. However, she still loved fast driving and collected the speeding tickets to prove it.Hitchcock, Mrs. A. Sherman, \\"Women in the Motor World\\", New England Automobile Journal, 26 February 1910, p52. Her glamorous life in New York slowly ground to a halt as Andrew Cuneo's bank and businesses came close to failure. In 1915 her marriage ended in divorce due to Andrew's scandalous involvement with a showgirl. By 1916, she no longer made the national news, and in 1917, she and her daughter Dolly moved to the Deerfield Valley of Vermont that she loved. In 1923, she followed her childhood sweetheart James Francis Sickman to Ontonagon, a small town in the upper peninsula of Michigan where she lived until her death in 1935. She eventually married Sickman and was heavily involved in improving the lives of Ontonagon's residents. Cuneo's obituary in the Ontonagon newspaper did not mention her racing career and her death merited only a brief paragraph in the New York Times. Cuneo was undoubtedly the most experienced female racer in the United States between 1905 and 1910. She had the respect of her male rivals who often let her drive their race cars, after women were excluded from racing. She remained an important spokesperson for women drivers and better roads for a decade. Although her determination to race against all comers, no doubt hastened the exclusion of women from organized racing, the men of the sanctioning body and the auto manufacturers of the day were willing to exclude women in order to save the sport which was considered by many as too dangerous to continue.

Stephanie Masters, Albert & Logan News, May 04, 2013 Early life and education De Leo received a degree in medicine and Surgery at the University of Padua in 1977, and then a diploma in psychiatry, also at Padua. In 1981 he studied behavioural sciences at the University of Leiden, the Netherlands. During this time a close colleague took his own life; this led De Leo to pursue suicide as a research topic. He focused his research on suicides in the elderly, and completed his doctorate in 1988. His dissertation, entitled Sunset Depression, was developed into a book on self- destructive behaviour in the elderly, Depression and Suicide in Late Life. Career After graduation, De Leo developed TeleHelp, or TeleCheck, the first system in Italy to provide medical and psycho-social assistance to frail elderly people living at home. He also helped start the Italian Association for Suicide Prevention, and an Italian registry for suicidal behaviours. He initiated and led the Psychogeriatric Service at the University of Padua in 1986 and a suicide research unit in 1992. =World Health Organization= De Leo presented findings from his dissertation on Sunset Depression to members of the World Health Organization in Geneva, and in 1991 was asked to organize a meeting in Padua, Italy, on the future of mental health in the world. He continued to work with WHO, researching a number of topics from depression and stress-related conditions, and participating in international committees and task forces on the quality of suicide mortality data. In collaboration with WHO Headquarters and the European Office he studied quality of life, particularly in the elderly. With David Jenkins, he created PEQOL, an evaluation package for quality of life in old age, and then with Jouko Lonnqvist, Rene Diekstra and Marco Trabucchi the LEIPAD. In 1995 he co-chaired WHOQOL, a project to develop an instrument for measuring health related quality of life. De Leo was a member of the WHO/EURO Multi-Centre Study on Suicidal Behaviour from 1988 to 2001, and directed the WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Suicide Prevention at the University of Padua from 1997 to 2002. In 2001, De Leo initiated the WHO/SUPRE-MISS study, which collated data from China, Iran, Vietnam, Brazil, South Africa, Estonia, India and Sri Lanka and demonstrated the importance of continuity of care in reducing suicide mortality. During his time as President of the International Association for Suicide Prevention, De Leo initiated World Suicide Prevention Day celebrated on 10 September every year since 2003.\\"Brisbane‚Äôs Story Bridge: a tale of tragedy for far too long\\".

The Conversation, September 4, 2014 In the same year, he helped launch, with the Western Pacific Office of the WHO, the Suicide Trends in At-Risk Territories study, which involved 22 countries. De Leo co-wrote a chapter on self-directed violence in the 2002 World Report on Violence and Health. He drafted the Blue Booklet Series of WHO guidelines to media professionals, about recording of suicide data and registering of non-fatal suicidal behavior, and contributed to the suicide module of the WHO mhGAP program. =Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention= De Leo became director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention at Griffith University in 1998. In 2001 De Leo organised a post-graduate education program in Suicide Prevention Studies, and in 2002 AISRAP became an accredited agency for the delivery of suicide prevention training. In 2004, De Leo opened a research outpatient service, the Life Promotion Clinic, for suicidal patients, which specialised in psychological treatments and operated as a Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists agency, training psychiatry students. =Other research activities= De Leo set up in Italy the De Leo Fund Onlus, a scientific NGO that provides assistance and care to those who are bereaved by traumatic deaths and manages a national telephone helpline for people traumatized by sudden losses.

He is depicted as a ruthless politician who rises from House Majority Whip to President of the United States through treachery, deception and murder. He is based on Francis Urquhart, the protagonist of the British novel and television series House of Cards, from which the American Netflix series is drawn. He is married to Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), and also had a sexual relationship with Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) in season 1. He made his first appearance in the series' pilot episode, \\"Chapter 1\\". Underwood is from Gaffney, South Carolina. He graduated from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina) in 1980 and, subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984. Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a non-rhotic Southern accent. During season 1, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before becoming President of the United States in the season finale. Underwood has been described as conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of political corruption. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends. Spacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Frank Underwood, but the character itself has been criticized for its repetitive nature and one-dimensionality. Spacey was one of the first three actors playing leading roles in web-television series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Spacey has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, winning one, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards, including two cast nominations and including two wins, for his performances. On November 3, 2017, following sexual assault claims made against Spacey, Netflix cut ties with the actor, putting the character's fate in question. In a teaser trailer for the sixth season of House of Cards, it is shown that Underwood died in 2017 and is now buried next to his father in South Carolina. The series finale reveals that his right-hand man, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), poisoned him in order to stop him from killing Claire. Background and description =Early life= Francis J. Underwood was born on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, with the threat of bank foreclosure on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1980 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into Harvard Law School. He received his J.D. degree from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had a homosexual relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet (David Andrews), which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian and publicly pays lip service to religious faith, but privately holds God in complete contempt. =Family= Underwood's great-great-great-grandfather, Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood, was a Confederate soldier who served in the 12th South Carolina Infantry Regiment of Samuel McGowan's Brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania. He served at the Bloody Angle on May 12, 1864, during the Civil War and was killed by a bludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of the night. Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry, even though he dismisses the Confederacy as \\"weak\\" and their cause of preserving slavery \\"asinine\\". When Underwood falls into a coma following an assassination attempt, Augustus appears in several of his hallucinations. His great-great grandfather was two when Augustus was killed. His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach farmer in his home town of Gaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance. =Political career= South Carolina Legislature Underwood was elected at the age of 25 to the South Carolina State Senate as one of the youngest members in the state's legislative history after graduating from Harvard in 1984. He was re-elected to the state senate at 29 in 1988 for his second, and last, term as a State Senator. Congressional Election Underwood was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 as a Democratic representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina, being sworn in during January 1991. He won another 11 consecutive elections, winning his final term in 2012. He was elected Whip for the Democratic Party in 2005, serving as House Majority Whip between 2005 and 2013. =Personal life= Personality Underwood is utterly ruthless and Machiavellian, and is willing to commit any crime, including murder, to further his goal of attaining power. Many critics have described him as a sociopath and as \\"pure evil\\". Often, Underwood's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's Richard III as Richard III of England, a character that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines. Spacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process. \\"There is so much I don't know about Francis, so much that I'm learning... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective... We are given clues by writers... Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who's complex and surprising, maybe even to yourself.\\" According to Time television critic James Poniewozik, by the end of the first episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because \\"I'm feelin' hungry today!\\", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: \\"She's as tough as a two-dollar steak\\" and plans to destroy an enemy the way \\"you devour a whale. One bite at a time\\". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by \\"[imagining] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet.\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter notes that, in Season 2, with Underwood's new position as Vice President, \\"He's got more power now and that means he instills more fear in his enemies\\". At one point during the season, he states \\"The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties. I need to prove what the vice president is capable of.\\" Underwood and Claire \\"continue their ruthless rise to power as threats mount on all fronts.\\" Sexuality Underwood's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in \\"Chapter 8\\" he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being \\"secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play\\". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there is a moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks), who later embarks in a physical and romantic emotional relationship with Claire. The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer. = Relationships = Relationship with Claire Underwood Stelter described Frank and Claire Underwood as a \\"scheming\\" couple. Michael Dobbs, the author of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood says, \\"I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.\\" While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, \\"My husband doesn't apologize... even to me.\\" Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says \\"The Underwoods have proven themselves almost robotic in their pursuit of power.\\" Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series \\"...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good.\\" Willimon notes that \\"What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power. Underwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard Edward Meechum at one point in season 2, but have otherwise largely given up intramarital and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power. International Business Times critic Ellen Killoran notes that this may relate back to Underwood's quotation of Oscar Wilde to Zoe Barnes in Season 1: \\"A great man once said, 'everything is about sex except sex. Sex is about power.'\\" Avoiding sex may retain the balance of power in their relationship. His relationship with Claire is the epicenter of season 2. Relationship with Zoe Barnes Underwood develops an intimate relationship with Washington Herald and Slugline reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), with Claire's knowledge. As the show begins, Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what's going on \\"behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways.\\" By the end of the first episode, Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood's accomplices. They begin a relationship, with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not \\"ask any questions\\" in return for his supplying her with sensitive political information. Toward the end of Season 1, she ends their personal relationship and begins investigating his connection to the apparent suicide of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll) (Underwood had in fact killed him by flooding his car with carbon monoxide while the Congressman was passed out drunk). Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the season 2 premiere, by pushing her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train after she begins to follow clues related to the murder. Relationship with Edward Meechum Underwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), and it is hinted several times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other. When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men. Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a threesome. Meechum remains Underwood's bodyguard once he becomes the president, and there does not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead. When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event, Meechum trades fire with the would-be assassin, and both die at the scene. Meechum's death is one of the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them. =Underwood-Urquhart comparisons= Underwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character Francis Urquhart, a Machiavellian post-Margaret Thatcher Chief Whip of the Conservative Party. Urquhart employs deceit, cunning, murder, and blackmail to influence and pursue the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. According to series producer Beau Willimon, the change in last name stemmed from the \\"Dickensian\\" feeling and \\"more legitimately American\\" sounding resonance of the name 'Underwood'. Whereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth, Underwood is a self-made man, having been born into a poor Southern family with an alcoholic father. Urquhart was one of television's first antiheroes, whereas Underwood follows the more recent rash of antiheroes that includes Tony Soprano of The Sopranos, Walter White of Breaking Bad, and Dexter Morgan of Dexter. However, unlike most other antiheroes, Underwood is not forced into immorality either by circumstance (White), birth (Soprano) or upbringing (Morgan). In his review of Season 2, Slant Magazines Alan Jones writes that Underwood is evil by choice. Although the character is based on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and filming of season 2, creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used Lyndon B. Johnson as a source of themes and issues addressed in House of Cards. Unlike the right wing Urquhart, who leads the Conservative Party, Underwood is a member of the Democratic Party, but cares little for ideology in favor of \\"ruthless pragmatism\\" in furthering his own political influence and power. =Breaking the fourth wall= Spacey summed up Underwood's relationship with the viewer‚Äîi.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall‚Äîas being like that of a \\"best friend\\" and \\"the person [he trusts] more than anyone.\\" Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions‚Äîtypically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, \\"Did you think I had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had.\\" In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Underwood vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps \\"What're you lookin' at?!\\" For the first four seasons, Underwood was the only character to break the fourth wall until the very end of the fourth season, during which Claire‚Äîthough silent‚Äîaddresses the camera directly with him. In the fifth season, Claire also addresses the camera directly, on one occasion explaining that she had always known the viewer was there, but didn't know if she could trust them. At the end, after usurping the Presidency from Underwood and deciding not to grant him a pardon, she looks into the camera again and states \\"My turn.\\" Fictional character biography =Season 1= At the start of the show, Underwood is a Democratic Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, where he has represented South Carolina's 5th congressional district since 1990. Underwood is passed over for an appointment as United States Secretary of State even though he had been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press. The viciousness of Underwood's manipulations escalates over the course of the season. He befriends Pennsylvania Rep. Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), encouraging him to quit drinking and run for Governor of Pennsylvania; then his underlings create enough pressure in the race to push Russo into publicly falling off the wagon and ruining his career. Underwood finally murders him and makes it look like suicide. He persuades Vice President Jim Matthews (Dan Ziskie) to resign so he can run for the office he previously held, Governor of Pennsylvania, the race being wide open following Russo's death. In the season finale, \\"Chapter 13\\", Underwood is appointed Vice President to replace Matthews. =Season 2= Underwood assumes the position of Vice President of the United States. Over the course of the season, he \\"faces challenges from similarly ambitious businessmen, the Chinese government and Congress itself\\" as he continues to pursue his political aspirations. His plotline revolves around battles with billionaire Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), involving Chinese money laundering. Over the course of the season his biggest challenges are the institutional power of the Office of the President and Tusk's power as a billionaire industrialist. He finds new rivals in Tusk, who seeks to maintain his position as Walker's right-hand adviser against Underwood's intrusion, and his former communications director, Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), who is now a lobbyist working with Tusk. At the beginning of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing. Toward the end of the season, Underwood orchestrates Walker's downfall. He secretly leaks the details of the money laundering, for which Walker is blamed. While publicly supporting Walker, Underwood works behind the scenes to have him impeached, with Sharp's help. In the season finale, \\"Chapter 26\\", Walker resigns, and Underwood succeeds him as President of the United States. =Season 3= Season 3 begins with Underwood's presidency off to a rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward. He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill, America Works, but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it; they also tell him that they will not support him if he seeks the presidential nomination in the next election. He nominates Claire for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, but her nomination is defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing. Underwood announces that he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by stripping entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women's votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses. Meanwhile, the Underwoods' marriage is faltering. Underwood gives Claire the ambassador job in a recess appointment, but she is forced to resign in order to solve a diplomatic crisis. Claire begins to question whether she still loves her husband, and they get into an ugly fight in which he tells her that she is nothing without him. Season 3 ends with Claire leaving Underwood as he prepares for the New Hampshire primary. =Season 4= Underwood trails Dunbar in the polls, eventually losing the New Hampshire primary. Realizing that he needs Claire to win, he persuades her to come back by promising to support her run for a congressional district in Texas. However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign. On the day of the South Carolina primary, Claire retaliates by arranging for two compromising photos to be leaked: one of Underwood's father with a Klansman, and one of Underwood posing with a Confederate Civil War re-enactor. Underwood deduces that Claire was behind the leaks, and confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did, and puts forth a proposition: that she run as his vice president. He angrily rejects the idea. Lucas Goodwin is released from prison and, seeking revenge for Barnes' death, shoots Underwood at a campaign rally, hitting him in the liver. He also mortally wounds Meechum, who manages to kill him before succumbing to his injuries. Underwood is rushed to the hospital for immediate surgery, and falls into a coma. It is soon discovered that he needs a liver transplant. Stamper manages to bump him to the top of the transplant list, and he survives. Once he recovers, he agrees to let Claire run as his vice president. Dunbar drops out of the race due to the discovery of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin a few days before the attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated. When American extremists loyal to the terrorist group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero‚Äîand then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the Washington Herald. Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit in the weeks before the election. =Season 5= In the days before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to formally declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of the terrorists and make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) stage a cyberattack on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election drags on unresolved for several weeks. The presidency is finally set to be decided by a contingent election in the House. Neither Underwood nor Conway receive enough votes, however, so Underwood appoints Claire Acting President until the House votes again. Underwood tries to convince Arizona Congressman Alex Romero (James Martinez) to vote in his favor, but when Underwood refuses to help him with his own agenda, Romero forms a committee to impeach him. The Underwoods blackmail Conway's influential campaign manager Mark Usher (Campbell Scott) into joining their side by threatening to release recordings of Conway berating a pilot and his running mate Ted Brockhart (Colm Feore) threatening to kill Frank. Once Usher begins working for them, they release the tapes anyway, which costs Conway the election. Underwood is now President-elect, but his past once again comes back to haunt him when Hammerschmidt writes a story linking him to Barnes' death. When Romero's committee intensifies its investigation, Underwood tries to divert public attention by ordering troops into Syria under the pretense of preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her down a flight of stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation is part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed, and persuades Stamper to \\"confess\\" to murdering Barnes. For Underwood's plan to work, however, Claire has to pardon him and Stamper, which would damage her credibility with the public. Claire promises him that she will grant the pardons, but makes no mention of them during her first address to the nation as president. Angered, Underwood calls her several times, but each time he gets her voicemail, causing him to worry that she has abandoned him. He breaks the fourth wall and says, \\"If she doesn't pardon me, I'll kill her.\\" =Season 6= While Underwood does not physically appear in the sixth season of House of Cards, he is mentioned several times, and his actions‚Äîoccurring offscreen‚Äîhave great significance. A teaser trailer for the sixth season, released in September 2018, portrays Claire visiting Underwood's grave. Another trailer, released weeks later, confirmed that Underwood is in fact dead. The first episode of the sixth season establishes that Underwood has died of an apparent heart attack; however, Claire suspects that he was murdered. The series finale reveals that Underwood had planned to kill Claire as revenge for abandoning him, and that Stamper poisoned him to stop him from being publicly exposed as a murderer, to \\"protect the legacy from the man\\". =Let Me Be Frank= On December 24, 2018, the same day that Spacey was charged with indecent assault and battery, he posted an unofficial short film continuation of House of Cards titled Let Me Be Frank to his YouTube channel. In the video, Spacey addressed the audience as Underwood, obliquely referred to the sexual assault allegations, and hinted that his character may not be dead. =KTWK= On December 24, 2019, Spacey posted an follow-up short film to Let Me Be Frank titled KTWK to his YouTube channel, in which, once again in-character as Francis \\"Frank\\" Underwood, he wishes the world a \\"Merry Christmas\\", comments on it having been a \\"pretty good year\\", asking one as they enter 2020 to cast their vote for more good in the world, and rather than \\"go on the attack\\" in response to one who has harmed one to instead \\"kill them with kindness\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCuuKhjLB0Q Critical response =Season 1= The New York Times David Itzkoff called Underwood a \\"scheming politician\\" who does \\"some of the most evil and underhanded things imaginable\\". Brian Stelter of The New York Times said Underwood \\"‚Ä¶is on a quest for power that's just as suspenseful as anything on television.\\" New York Daily News critic Don Kaplan says \\"‚Ä¶conniving Congressman Frank Underwood, is easily one of the most complex antiheroes on TV‚Äîexcept he's not on TV\\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle describes the character as one who \\"all but salivates over the chance to use his considerable power to gain more power, especially if it involves pulling the rug out from under some colleagues and the wool over the eyes of others.\\" Andrew Davies, the producer of the original UK TV series, feels that Underwood lacks the \\"charm\\" of the original character, Francis Urquhart. The Independent praised Spacey's portrayal as a more \\"menacing\\" character, \\"hiding his rage behind Southern charm and old-fashioned courtesy,\\" while The New Republic noted that \\"When Urquhart addressed the audience, it was partly in the spirit of conspiratorial fun. His asides sparked with wit. He wasn't just ruthlessly striving, he was amusing himself, mocking the ridiculousness of his milieu. There is no impishness about Spacey's Frank Underwood, just numb, machine-like ambition. Even his affection for his wife is a calculation.\\" Poniewozik praises Underwood's accent, saying \\"Spacey gives Underwood a silky Southern accent you could pour over crushed ice and sip with a sprig of mint on Derby Day.\\" Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes the accent as a \\"mild but sometimes missing Carolina accent\\". Time listed Frank Underwood among the 11 most influential fictional characters in 2013. =Season 2= According to The Kansas City Star Smith, \\"Frank hasn't changed, and neither has his brand of Machiavellian political theater\\" and \\"Spacey has lost none of his smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain\\". According to Variety Brian Lowry, \\"Kevin Spacey's showy performance as an unscrupulous politician\\" is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the \\"failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes\\". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that \\"nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him\\". Goodman says \\"Spacey is nothing if not constantly magnetic\\". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that \\"Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and reminds us of the fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there\\". However, Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2, noting that the season was \\"...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before.\\" Poniewozik notes that \\"It also remains a delight to watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards' arid Capitol chill. If only his character weren't so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series' movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood's league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it.\\" Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that \\"Frank's \\"Survivor\\"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive.\\" and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: \\"...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided...\\" Verne Gay of Newsday notes that \\"Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment‚Äîa compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey- toned drawl.\\" Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says \\"By positing a Johnsonesque power broker and master schemer who wields cabalistic influence behind the scenes, House of Cards assigns order and purpose to what, in real life, is too often just an endless, baffling tick-tack-toe stalemate.\\" NPR's Eric Deggans says that Underwood \\"blends velvety charm and mesmerizing menace like no other character on television\\". New York Observer critic Drew Grant notes that although the series aired during the golden age of dramatic antiheroes, Underwood's villainy has become trite: \\"House of Cards is a good reminder, however, that there is a reason Iago wasn't the center of Othello. Unrelenting, unexplained cruelty can be as pedantic as constant kindness.\\" Spacey's portrayal was not without detractors: Hitfix reviewer Alan Sepinwall accused him of \\"hamming it up\\" and \\"phoning it in on a not very good show to begin with\\". =Season 3= Reviews for season 3 of House of Cards were mostly positive. However, a few critics found the Underwood character was becoming repetitive: the critical consensus on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes held that, \\"Season three introduces intriguing new political and personal elements to Frank Underwood's character, even if it feels like more of the same for some.\\" Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \\"Everyone in House of Cards has an agenda‚Äîa secret twitching in the attic. The thrill, and the horror, may lie in the degree to which we catch reflections of real life in its dark, cool contours.\\" Some critics opined that the Underwood character is less interesting once he achieves his goal of becoming president and actually has to govern. \\"You could take the show seriously just as long as you didn't have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics,\\" wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. \\"But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage.\\" Critics continued to praise Spacey's performance, however. Don Kaplan of The New York Daily News wrote, \\"Underwood's bottomless appetite for dark dealing keeps Spacey so deliciously detestable you can't help but keep rooting for the bad guy to win.\\" =Season 4= In season 4, Jacob Solworthy wrote in his review of the first six episodes of season four: \\"Until now, 'House of Cards' has centred on the character's outward expression of power -- not to mention his hunger for it -- but the writers have shrewdly stripped that back, instead focusing on the character's internal fears in a way not dissimilar from Tony's dream sequences in 'The Sopranos',\\" he later added, \\"You'll never root for Frank more than you do by the end of these six episodes.\\" On the other hand, Daniel Fienberg from The Hollywood Reporter was critical of Spacey's performance, writing: \\" Spacey's performance, which at least had an appealingly theatrical extravagance when the series began, has grown less enjoyable. Having reached a pinnacle, there's no way to root for Frank's striving anymore, if you ever were, but House of Cards has yet to commit to urging us to root for Frank's downfall.\\" There was also considerable mention of the evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. \\"[T]heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds,\\" wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a \\"jump the shark\\" moment for the series: > The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some > innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, > they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. > Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine > the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of > despicability has been crossed. Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: > House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is > evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in > front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a > bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost > viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign > and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie > Sanders. =Season 5= Spacey's performance as Frank Underwood in Season 5‚Äîalong with the series itself‚Äîreceived mixed reviews. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox Media called Spacey's performance \\"hamstanding\\", and said, \\"It's as if House of Cards wants to make Frank go full authoritarian dictator, but lacks the wherewithal to actually push its reality toward some sort of alternate dystopia.\\" The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Flenberg called Spacey's Underwood \\"increasingly broad and hammy\\" in season 5, while Times Daniel D'addario wrote that the character was too one-dimensional to elicit a good performance from Spacey: \\"Underwood isn't Nixonian or Clintonian (pick your villain); he's a flat character for whom recognition is its own reward. This may make the show a surprisingly good fit for our times. But onscreen as in life, the desire for fame alone is insufficient motivation to compel viewers to stay tuned.\\" Other critics praised him, however. \\"Spacey's honeysuckle drawl and flinty-eyed leer are as amusing as ever. He's almost always the broadest performer in any given room, but that's part of the show's design‚Äîa way of drawing us into the character's almost omnisciently evil mindset,\\" wrote Vulture.com's Matt Zoller Seitz. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote, \\"Spacey seems invigorated by the material, and perhaps, our moment. He's certainly buffed and honed Frank to a shine while grounding it, scuffing it, by playing to mortality and age. He's an All-Star Survivor, but a gray one.\\" Critics noted that the character of Frank Underwood gained a new resonance when considered in the context of the Trump administration. \\"In a deliciously cynical flourish, the commander- in-chief's response to whisperings about his misdeeds is to conjure a bogeyman in the shape of terrorist group Ico, which he presents as a clear and imminent danger to America,\\" Ed Power wrote for The Telegraph. \\"This yields the returning series's first stone-cold Trump-ism as Underwood announces plans to shut America's borders to unwelcome outsiders. Real world events are further echoed as protestors gather outside the White House chanting 'not my President'.\\" =Awards and nominations= At the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards, Spacey was nominated for Best Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Underwood. On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online only web television for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove, and House of Cards, earned nominations.

The word comes from troubadour, a medieval poet-musician who wrote and sang songs about courtly love. Like the troubadours of old, the Haitian twoubadou is a singer-composer who accompanies himself on songs that tell about the bitterness and humor of love, often using risqu√© or suggestive lyrics. History Twoubadou was developed in the early 20th century. It combined music derived from the guajiro traditions of Cuba, (which is related to the jibaro musical tradition of Puerto Rico) with a Haitian musical style called m√©ringue. Twoubadou was brought back by Haitian migrant laborers who went to work as cutters on sugar plantations in Cuba who traveled back and forth to harvest the seasonal crop at the turn of the century. The instruments in the ensemble are portable, since most twoubadou had to carry all of their possessions back and forth between Haiti and the sugarcane fields abroad. It is characterized by the use of the following acoustic instruments such as an acoustic guitar or two, an accordion, and percussion instruments. It also features a pair of maracas or a graj (scraper), a tanbou (barrel drum), and a large lamellophone, with three to five keys called manibula, maniba, or malimba, (depending on the geographic region) that provides the sound of a bass guitar. True to the original Spanish troubadours, the music and its lyrics usually conjured up images of true love and lasting relationships. Haitians have been part of a network of migrant labor since the late eighteenth century, when Haitian workers routinely to Cuba to participate in the sugarcane harvest which was most successful in the Caribbean after the independence of Haiti of 1804 (formerly known as Saint- Domingue) when its production topped the world. Haitian migrants have also shaped the musical styles in the areas where they worked. Tumba francesa is the Cuban term for Haitian-derived recreational drumming and dancing; the style is still practiced among expatriate Haitian cane cutters. Origins The structure of the twoubadou song is a simple two-part, verse‚Äìchorus form. In Haiti, twoubadou is beloved by the people as their national music, but it is nearly unknown in the rest of the world. The type of performer designated by the term twobadou changed over time. Gage Averill has described the singer Auguste de Pradines (1879-1947), widely known by the name Kandjo, as an archetype of the meaning of the term as it evolved in the twentieth century: Popular culture Mizik twoubadou (troubadour music) has always had a following in Haiti, especially in small nightclubs where combos of two guitars, maracas, tanbou, and a pair of vocalists serenade dancers with Haitian and Cuban music. Perhaps the most famous contemporary component of the twoubadou style among popular entertainers in the latter twentieth century was Jean-Gesner Henry, better known as Coup√© Clou√© was renowned for his sexually suggestive lyrics. Recently, commercial artists have embraced the twoubadou sound, releasing several albums in recent years that foreground the guitar and the rhythms of Cuban music. One of the most successful releases is Haitiando, a three-CD series of Cuban music translated into Krey√≤l and sung to the music of the two-guitar ensemble. The Haitiando series makes the often forgotten connection between Haitian and Cuban music explicit with their translations of popular Cuban songs in Krey√≤l. Although more popular during times past, today it is sometimes considered pass√© (old-fashion) or only for the old folks. Although more recently, it has begun being eclipsed by more popular forms of rasin and kompa music, it is making a comeback even among groups like Mizik Mizik. The song \\"Blakawout\\" from their album of in 1999 has made this a popular form of music among the younger crowds. Troubadours perform in small ensembles and can be found in larger restaurants, playing requests for patrons for small donations, or performing outdoors for celebrations. Some renowned compas bands and musicians have incorporated twoubadou into some of their songs. The 56th President of Haiti, Michel Martelly's (known by his stage name Sweet Micky) Pa Manyen Fanm Nan, Alan Cav√©'s Ma Rose, Mika Benjamin's Ou Pati, and T-Vice's Tu Me Touches, were all hits. Twoubadou groups can be heard in Haiti at f√®t patwonal (patron‚Äôs day feasts), during Carnival, at private parties, and in hotels and restaurants frequented by tourists.

The aim of the movement is to encourage attitudes and behaviors that promote tolerance and anti-discrimination among the Indonesian people. Created as a result of collaboration among a number of civil movements in Jakarta, this campaign is driven by concern about the various forms of discrimination which have been rife in Indonesia since the reformation of 1998. The ITD Movement believes that civil society can play its role and contribute to changing intolerant attitudes and behaviors and growing discrimination in the community. It can also urge the government to be aware of and promote a spirit of tolerance and anti-discrimination throughout the nation. The ITD Movement is working to integrate cultural works, including literature, art, music and film, to trigger public awareness in Indonesia about the facts of intolerance and discrimination. Its target is twofold: to strengthen public appreciation of Indonesia's diversity, and to minimize discriminatory public policy until we create an era of an Indonesia Without Discrimination. The ITD Movement was conceived by Denny JA, a survey expert and Indonesian political consultant who is concerned about a transition to democracy in Indonesia which has been colored by discrimination and violence: discrimination which can be clearly seen in government regulations and acts of intolerance and violence in the community. Denny JA, founder of the Indonesian Survey Institute Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI), created the Denny JA Foundation for an Indonesia Without Discrimination a vehicle for promoting and championing his vision of an Indonesia Without Discrimination throughout the nation.  Background of ITD  It began with a survey. Through surveys on tolerance conducted periodically by the LSI, Denny JA noticed a disturbing trend over the previous seven years towards increasing intolerance and willingness of the Indonesian people to use violence to solve issues. This fact was made more alarming by the growing number of discriminatory state regulations in certain regions of Indonesia. The need to do something about this discovery was the initiator of the ITD Movement. There were two goals: to drive change in state policy, and to facilitate positive change in the attitudes of the Indonesian people towards diversity in all its forms. The first step was taken. In March 2012, Denny JA published his collection of poetic essays entitled Atas Nama Cinta, or In the Name of Love. These were stories of discrimination in different guises, based on ethnicity, religion or religious understanding, gender and sexual oriententation. These five stories of discrimination in the form of poetic essays then metamorphosized into five short 45-minute films. These five films, Romi dan Yuli dari Cikeusik, Bunga Kering Perpisahan, Saputangan Fang Yin, Minah Tetap Dipancung, Cinta Terlarang Batman dan Robin, were produced with well-known director Hanung Bramantyo. As well as becoming films, the poetic essays were also read and recorded musically and theatrically, and can be watched on the website. Armed with an understanding of social trends through surveys and a number of cultural works, ITD Movement symbolized the importance of one Indonesia: an Indonesia Without Discrimination. Taking advantage of the momentum created by the Sumpah Pemuda (Youth Pledge) ceremony in 2012, the ITD Movement organized a series of events entitled Indonesia Without Discrimination Week. On October 28, 2012, the movement held a mass gathering in front of Hotel Indonesia, Jakarta, with a number of cultural attractions and gymnastic displays. That's where the pledge ‚ÄúSatu Indonesia: Indonesia Tanpa Diskriminasi!‚Äù (One Indonesia: an Indonesia Without Discrimination) was born. Since that moment, the ITD Movement has declared that October 28 will henceforth not only be commemorated as Youth Pledge Day, but also as the day when the country reaffirms its commitment to an Indonesia Without Discrimination. The ITD Movement believes that Indonesia will one day enter an era free of discrimination and intolerance.  The Foundation  To coordinate and mobilize the ITD movement, in September 2012 Denny JA also founded The Denny JA Foundationuntuk Indonesia Without Discrimination: the Denny JA Foundation for an Indonesia Without Discrimination. The name of the foundation includes its primary function of contributing to the vision of one Indonesia: an Indonesia Without Discrimination. Since it was founded the Denny JA Foundation has held a number of events and activities, including focus group discussions, ITD film screenings, Indonesia Without Discrimination workshops, poetry, painting, photography and song-writing competitions on the Indonesia Without Discrimination theme. The Denny JA Foundation has also staged exhibitions of paintings, digital photo-essays, photo essays and individual photographs, and Indonesia Without Discrimination songs. In the field of research, the Denny JA Foundation has also released the results of two surveys on intolerance, violence and discrimination among the Indonesian public. The Denny JA Foundation will continue to organize activities to strengthen the spirit of an Indonesia Without Discrimination, and will use a variety of popular cultural media to conduct serious research about public attitudes and trends among Indonesian society.  Funding and Operations  All funding for the ITD Movement comes from personal contributions from the movement's founder Denny JA. His awareness of how important equality is for all Indonesians has moved Denny JA to contribute his energy, thoughts, and money. Denny JA quotes the well-known poem by Robert Frost: ‚ÄúIn the road not taken, ‚ÄúThis is the road not taken, the road less travelled by‚Äù to explain his prophetic motive and mission. Denny admits that the ITD Movement is part of his passion and vision. ‚ÄúHelping minorities who experience discrimination is clearly not popular, and carries a political risk. This is a purely charitable activity, because I am using my own funds. But it needs to be done to create a modern Indonesian civilization,‚Äù he argues. This father of the Indonesian political survey hopes that an Indonesia Without Discrimination is not merely one man's dream. He hopes it will become the dream of the entire nation. In welcoming the winners and visitors to the ITD exhibition, Denny JA also revealed the importance of the Indonesia Without Discrimination campaign through various media, primarily art and culture. Denny is optimistic that Indonesia will one day enter an era free of discrimination. ‚ÄúIn the history of advanced civilization, attempts at cultural enlightenment can win. We also want our Indonesia Without Discrimination initiative to win,‚Äù he said.  Progress of ITD  The echos of the ITD Movement began to grow louder after the events of Indonesia Without Discrimination week at the end of October 2012, the realization of the need for an Indonesia Without Discrimination Movement came with the publication of the poetic essays Atas Nama Cinta in March 2012. Beginning with the book, the ITD Movement bloomed into action. * Poetic Essays Poetic essays were the starting point of the ITD Movement. This new genre of poetry written by Denny JA contains five stories of discrimination written in a literary style complete with footnotes. The five stories were published as one book, Atas Nama Cinta, in March 2012. Although a limited number of copies were printed, visitors can read the publication in Bahasa Indonesia and English on the website, which has been well received by readers. Between its launch in March 2012 and December 2012, the website received 7.5 million visitors. Atas Nama Cinta has also received widespread public attention through a number of media reviews in Kompas, Koran Tempo and Media Indonesia daily newspapers, Jurnal Sastra, Gatra, and Majalah Sastra ‚ÄúHorison‚Äù magazines, and other local and national publications. The genre of the poetic essay has also stolen the critical spotlight and entered the realms of literature and literary polemics. * Musical Poetic Essays Musical poetic essays came about as a direct development from different ways of performing and presenting the poetic essay. The five poems of Atas Nama Cinta were read with musical accompaniment and presented audio-visually. The reading and cultivation of musical poetic essays involved a number of well-known Indonesian cultural figures, including Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, Putu Wijaya, Sujiwo Tedjo, Ine Febriyanti, Niniek L Karim, and Fatin Hamamah. The videos were subsequently uploaded to YouTube, and have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people. * ITD film The poetic essays have also been developed into five short films of 45 minutes each under the titles of the five poems in Atas Nama Cinta. Saputangan Fang Yin tells the story of discrimination that befell the ethnic Chinese during the period of reform in 1998. Minah Tetap Dipancung is about the pain and sorrow faced by Indonesias overseas workers. Bunga Kering Perpisahan tells of the problems of those who fall in love with and marry people of different religions. Romi dan Yuli dari Cikeusik is the story of the conflict of religious understanding between mainstream Indonesian Muslims and members of the Jemaat Ahmadiyah Indonesia sect. Cinta Terlarang Batman dan Robin describes the dilemmas and problems faced by homosexuals in Indonesia. These five films exploring the most intimate thoughts of each character were produced by Denny JA and well-known director Hanung Bramantyo. They were performed by some of the biggest names in the Indonesian acting world, including seperti Agus Condro, Tyo Pasukodewo, Sazkia Adya Mecca, Leoni, and Peggy Melati Sukma. * Sapu Tangan Fang Yin disutradarai oleh Karin Bintaro.

Discussions about the various forms of discrimination which take place in Indonesia ‚Äì whether based on ethnicity, religion or religious interpretation, gender or sexual orientation ‚Äì and public screenings of ITD films have been held among communities both in and outside Jakarta. The Indonesia Without Discrimination movement will continue to organize events to strengthen the Indonesia Without Discrimination movement and help to realize an Indonesia which embraces diversity and rejects discrimination. * ITD competitions ITD competitions have stimulated wider public participation in spreading the Indonesia Without Discrimination spirit. The foundation has already organized competitions in poetic essay writing and reviewing, painting, photography and photo essays, and songwriting. A number of these competitions have held for specific groups, including a poetic essay review contest among middle schools in Banten province, but in general they are open to the general public as long as the terms and conditions are fulfilled. A number of ITD competitions have attracted widespread public participation. For example, the school poetic essay review contest in Banten, with a top prize of ten million rupiah (around US$970), received 120 entries (from the beginning of April to May 28, 2012). The national poetic essay-writing competition (From June 16 to October 28, 2012), which offered prizes totalling 50 million rupiah (a little under US$5,000), attracted 429 entries from people all over the country. The most prestigious event to date Sementara was the ITD painting competition held from June 16 to September 15, 2012, which offered a top prize of 100 million rupiah (approximately US$9,700) and attracted 114 entries from all over Indonesia. Photographic and other competitions have been no less successful. Over 400 photographs were received from around the archipelago telling the story of different discriminatory practices to compete for prizes totalling 50 million rupiah, and a competition to find the best original song held from June 16 to October 28, 2012 netted 47 new songs from all over the country. * ITD exhibition The natural progression from the ITD's nationwide competitions was a collection of week-long exhibitions of art, photography and photo essays, digital photo essays and songs From December 11 to 18 2012. A number of paintings and photographs were displayed at the Sigiart Gallery in Pisa Kafe Mahakam in South Jakarta. These art works not only recorded discrimination but told stories, and even the song entries were tales of discriminatory practices. The painting ‚ÄúAku Tidak Menginginkan Hitam-Putih‚Äù (I Don't Want Black and White) depicts a pair of children who do not want to be painted in black and white. Although the paintbrush is eager to create their likenesses in monochrome, other colors begin to creep up their arms and into their faces and clothes. The artist is Hudi Alfa, winner of the ITD painting competition and the top prize of 100 million rupiah. Abdurrohman Wahid's entry tells a more explicit story. A well-dressed man is sitting on a chair covering his face with his hands. He is wearing red high heels on his crossed feet. This is the painting ‚ÄúBatman dan Robin/Penolakan Diri‚Äù (Batman and Robin/Self-Denial) which won second place. ‚ÄúPunk not Dead‚Äù is a photo essay about discrimination in Serambi Mekah, Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. Without words, ‚ÄúPunk not Dead‚Äù shouts the story of discrimination suffered by the punk community. A photograph titled ‚ÄúParmalin‚Äù shows another expression of discrimination in its depiction of a man brandishing an identity card with an empty space under ‚Äòreligion,‚Äô illustrating the problems still faced by religious minorities in Indonesia. ‚ÄúAirmata Darah‚Äù (Tears of Blood), a digital photo essay by Indonesia Without Discrimination movement founder Denny JA clearly conveys the Indonesia Without Discrimination message: Driven from our legitimate home/ Simply because of our religious beliefs / Muslim in Ambon, Christians in Poso, Hindus in Lampung/ Ahmadiyah in Mataram, Syiah in Sampang/ And Kaharingan in Central Kalimantan. People flocked to the opening of the exhibition, which was covered by a number of national printed and electronic media. Artist Arahmaiani applied his brush to a blank canvas and wrote the words ‚ÄúIndonesia Without Discrimination,‚Äù and visitors added their own messages. The once white canvass was now covered with color, conveying the spirit of an Indonesia Without Discrimination. * ITD survey The ITD movement also bases its activities on research and surveys into the Indonesian public's take on tolerance and discrimination issues. By the end of December 2012, the ITD movement had carried out and released the results of two surveys, the first on the increase in the number of Indonesian people who are uncomfortable with diversity. The findings of this national survey by the Denny JA Foundation and LSI Community from October 1 to 8 2012 were presented at a press conference on October 21, 2012. The survey showed an increase in the public's discomfort towards those from different backgrounds. Compared with a 2005 LSI survey, the Indonesian public have grown less comfortable with their neighbors of different religions, including the Shia and Ahmadiyah, and with homosexuality. More worryingly, public willingness to use violence has also increased significantly, from just 9.8% to 24% in 2012. The second survey covered the worst five cases of discriminatory violence since reform in 1998. The survey was released under the title Wanted: 2014 Presidential Candidate to Defend Diversity on December 23, 2012. The survey showed that 67.5% of Indonesians rate the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as less than effective in protecting primordial diversity in Indonesia, and the public believes this has triggered widespread discrimination and violence. The Indonesian public is hoping a 2014 presidential candidate will appear who is able to defend diversity in an Indonesia Without Discrimination. * Charity The ITD movement is also involved in charitable events. Working with the Task Force for Child Protection, the ITD movement sent a team of storytellers to console the child victims of discrimination and violence against Shiites during the Sampang evacuation in Madura, East Java. The Sampang tragedy is another black stain of discrimination and intolerance towards diversity in Indonesia. One week after Idul Fitri celebrations, on August 26, 2012, a mob attacked the homes of over 600 Shiite Muslims in three villages in the Omben district of Sampang, Madura. Thirty seven Shiite homes were destroyed, one person died and six others were wounded. The team of storytellers left Jakarta on August 30 and stayed in Sampang for one month with the personal support of Denny JA, founder of the ITD movement. .

As of 2016 it was the sixth-largest law firm in Japan by number of lawyers, with 160 attorneys on staff. It also has the most offices of any Japanese law firm in history; in July 2013, it opened its 49th and 50th offices in Nagasaki and Sasebo. The firm eventually plans to have offices in each of the 235 courthouse locations in Japan. It is headquartered in the Sunshine 60 building in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. The firm's focus is on personal and corporate bankruptcy and debt restructuring. As of 2009 the firm was handling over 2,000 new debt restructuring cases each month. In recent years, the firm has diversified its practice into automobile accidents, divorces and other areas due to a gradual decline in debt restructuring work. History Yukito Ishimaru established the firm in October 2004 and serves as its managing partner. He had been hired as a new graduate at Sega in 1995 and was stationed as the assistant manager of a video arcade in Obihiro, Hokkaido, but received a suspended prison sentence and lost his job less than a year later after being arrested three times for drunk driving. His experience with his own barely-competent lawyer inspired him to become a lawyer and establish the Adire firm. Ishimaru and the firm received a reprimand from the Tokyo Bar Association in 2010 after it was found that the firm had failed to file for bankruptcy on behalf of a corporate client more than two years after being asked to do so. The firm was penalized by the Japanese Consumer Affairs Agency in 2016 in relation to its advertising of debt adjustment services, on the basis that the advertisements offered purportedly one-month, limited-time fee discounts that were actually offered continuously for nearly five years. Following the agency's action, several regional bar associations decided that the firm's actions warranted disciplinary action against the firm and several of its lawyers.

The gate connecting it and Intramuros (where most of the Spanish colonial and administrative government was located) was called Puerta del Parian. The Parian rapidly became the commercial centre of Manila. The community had more than a hundred shops comprising the Chinese silk market, small shops of tailors, cobblers, painters, bakers, confectioners, candle makers, silversmiths, apothecaries and other tradesmen. The location of the Parian moved from time to time and persisted until 1790, when it was torn down to make room for new fortifications on the northern side of the Intramuros.

The homes sit at the foot of East Mountain within the Masonic Addition, the first addition platted following incorporation. Encompassing roughly , the district is bounded by College Avenue (U.S. Route 71B) on the west, Olive and Walnut Avenues on the east, Rebecca Street to the north, and Spring Street to the south. The primary streets within the district are the namesake Washington Avenue and Willow Avenue, crossing Davidson Street, Maple Street, Lafayette Street, and Dickson Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and its boundaries were increased in 1995.

The most historically significant structure in the city, it was built in 1853 and used as a base of operations for both the Union and Confederate States of America at different periods during the American Civil War. The house was the point of contention during the Battle of Fayetteville, which took place at the nearby intersection of College Avenue and Dickson Street. Headquarters House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, prior to the designation of the Washington‚ÄìWillow Historic District. During the siege on April 18, 1863, the Union-occupied structure sustained damage from a Confederate cannonball striking the front door. The Union ultimately repelled the attack and was able to maintain control of northwest Arkansas. A one-story weatherboard structure with fluted columns surrounding a central portico, the Headquarters House has significant elements of the Greek Revival style. The corners of the building possess decorative pilasters with transom and small sidelights adjacent to the doorway.

The fruit, which is positioned above the persistent sepals, becomes woody with age. The glossy black seeds protrude from red arils. The species was formally described in 1859 by Victorian government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller based on plant material collected by Walter Hill, first superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. It occurs in dry rainforest from the Burdekin River in Queensland southwards to Wauchope, New South Wales. The species is cultivated for its dense foliage and ornamental, but inedible, berries.

California State Route 246 used to run to Surf, but in 1984 the highway was truncated at Lompoc and the road from Lompoc to Surf is designated West Ocean Avenue. Sections of Surf Beach are closed between March 1 and September 30 every year during the nesting season of the western snowy plover. The closures are in place to protect the bird under the Endangered Species Act. If a set number of trespass violations have been reached during any nesting season (currently 50), the beach is closed entirely. History Surf grew as a railway town to accommodate the personnel needed to maintain the trains and tracks after Southern Pacific Railroad built a station here for its Coast Line in 1900. In 1909, the schooner cargo ship Sibyl Marston sank off the coast south from Surf. The station at Surf became popular with U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base) during World War II. The population of the town peaked at 40, with most residents being employed with the railroad. As trains modernized, Surf experienced depopulation, to the point where Southern Pacific was only operating a telegraph station.

Plot Honorary soldier Lee Cheung-kong was falsely accused for robbery committed by his friends in China and was arrested by Officer Mo Heung-yeung. Cheung-kong's appeal was rejected and sentenced to death, but he successfully escapes his execution but was stabbed by Mo while running. He illegally escapes to Hong Kong and meets two illegal immigrants, Seung Moon and Chicken Heart, developing feelings with the former when she treated his wound and getting intimate hiding in a truck being searched by officers. After arriving in Hong Kong, Moon was sold as a prostitute to repay debts, while Chicken Heart and his younger brother were taken in by triad boss Master Leung as labor. Cheung- kong owes Snakehead, the shipper of the illegal immigrants, HK$3000, when his uncle refuses to acknowledge him. Leung notices Cheung-kong's combat skills when the latter fights Snakehead, and his henchmen and offers to pay for his debt and a job at his construction site. Cheung-kong finds out from Leung about Moon being a prostitute and begs him for help. Leung suggests Cheung- kong to join a jewel robber gang led by Master Cheuk and reveals to Cheung- kong the brothel where Moon is forced to work, but Leung informs the brothel boss to anticipate Cheung-kong's arrival. Armed with a machete, Cheung-kong rescue Moon and fights off the brothel boss and his henchmen but Moon gets taken away in a car. Leung convinces Cheuk of Cheung-kong's fighting skills so Cheuk arranges him to partner with Chicken Heart, whose brother was killed while taking a bullet for him. At this time, Mo was sent to Hong Kong to hunt for Cheung-kong. The Hong Kong police initially prevents Mo from interfering with Hong Kong's legal system, but reluctantly assigns Inspector Cat to work with him. Cheuk leads Cheung-kong, Chicken Heart, and his gang to rob a jewelry shop where Cheung-kong shoots an off duty police superintendent and Chicken Heart gets stuck inside a safe with a manager. Cheung-kong breaks Chicken Heart out with a grenade and flee from the police and the gang pick them up. Afterwards, Cheuk refuses to release Moon, blaming Cheung-kong for shooting a police superintendent and having to find a new hideout for him. Cheuk also refuses to pay Chicken Heart, who has not received pay for three previous robberies. Leung's underling, 966, lead Cheung-kong and Chicken Heart to their new hideout in a boat where Cheung-kong reunites with Moon. Cheung- kong discovers Mo's arrival to Hong Kong to hunt for him and wants to leave, angering Cheuk, who instructs his henchmen to capture Moon in a speed boat so Cheung-kong agrees to work for an entire year for Cheuk, who allows him to reunite with Moon. Later, Leung gets taken by Mo to the police station and beaten and blackmailed by Mo to reveal the whereabouts of Cheung-kong, so he and Cheuk sways Cheung-kong to kill Mo and gives him a pistol while having lured Mo to the nightclub that they are in. Cheung-kong fires at Mo, erupting gunfight a between the two which leads to a scuffle until Cheung-kong subdues Mo, but ultimately lets Mo go. Enraged, Cheuk threatens to sell Moon and Cheung-kong fights Cheuk, so Leung allows Cheung-kong talk with Moon on the phone in order to continue to exploit him. Meanwhile, both Leung and Cheuk rape Moon while having her captured. While robbing an armoured truck at their next heist, an intense gunfight with security guards ensues where Cheuk escapes while Cheung-kong and Chicken Heart realize they were given blank guns by Leung and Cheuk, so they force 966 to bring them to an apartment where Moon is hidden, where Cheung-kong blasts Leung with a submachine gun and kicks Cheuk out the window off the balcony before escaping with Moon when the police arrive. Chicken Heart dies on their way to the dock, where Cheung-kong and Moon sail off before returning to land when Moon is suffering from gunshot injuries. Heung-yeung arrives to stop Cheung-kong, but eventually let the couple go to a doctor to treat Moon's wound, and Mo visits them where Kong tells Mo that when China's legislation improves, he will return.

History StockTouch was created to give users a visual picture of the overall state of the stock market. It merged real time financial information with data visualization technology. Visible Market is a New York-based company. The concept for the app was based on a desire to clarify vast amounts of financial data. The developers noticed a trend among business professionals to move away from desktop tools and towards mobile ones. In response, they initiated the creation of a different, non-linear app which would visually track stock market trends. StockTouch was intended as a platform that provided ‚Äúdemocratized‚Äù financial information for making the stock market more accessible to the general public. To that end, Visible Market was a forerunner among tech companies to use game engine technology and animation in the design of its mobile app, with the goal of helping users to visualize and navigate financial data.

Most definitions of this term involve a practical look at the legal and ownership structure, as well as the issue of control of the day-to-day operations of a business. The consideration of control of a business is meant to discourage the unethical practice of men placing wives, daughters, or low-level female employees in positions of ownership, when in fact she may have little to do with the day-to-day management of the company, for the sake of receiving some government benefits or other consideration. A Woman-Owned Business Enterprise (WBE) is defined as one that is at least 51% owned, operated and controlled on a daily basis by one or more female American citizens. WBEs are typically certified by a third- party, city, state or federal agency.Small Business Administration WOSB Program The Small Business Administration offers a similar definition of a Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) as a small business that is at least 51% owned, operated and controlled on a daily basis by one or more (in combination) female American citizens. The SBA's WOSB definition differentiates from the WBE definition, as it looks at the size of the business according to the specific industry standards table.  Support for Women Business Owners  Research shows that in most countries there are significant challenges for women business owners in comparison to men business owners. These challenges stem from many sources, including social and cultural stigmas, family and child-rearing responsibilities, maternity needs, educational background, career experience, and community support. Depending on the country in which a woman resides and/or is a citizen, there may be government or non-profit support for female business owners. There are several US organizations that provide third-party women-owned certifications and support including: U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce,U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)Women's Business Enterprise National Council, California Public Utilities Commission and National Women Business Owners Corporation.National Women Business Owner Corporation. In India, supporting groups include WeConnect, WEI, and some specific bank-sponsored loan schemes. In Europe, the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan is aimed at supporting women business owners, among other initiatives. US Federal Contracts There are specific set-aside programs for certain NAICS codes in which certified WOSBs (or in some cases Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), a subcategory of WOSB) may receive special consideration in a US government contract. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Federal government of the United States gave $25.4 billion in federal contracts to women-owned businesses in 2017, this was 5 percent of the total budget in the fiscal year. This was up from 3.25 percent of contracts in fiscal year 2008.

It is a 44-minute-long crossover with The Simpsons, and was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Peter Shin. It originally aired in the United States on September 28, 2014, on Fox, where both The Simpsons and Family Guy have aired since their respective debuts. In the episode, the Griffins meet the Simpsons for the first time and decide to stay with them after the Griffin family's car is stolen just outside Springfield. After the Griffins get their car back, Peter is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery, his employer, when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of Duff Beer. The idea for a crossover episode was suggested by Family Guy executive producer and former Simpsons writer Richard Appel, and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013. Five of the six main members of the voice cast of The Simpsons‚Äîthe exception being Harry Shearer‚Äîvoiced their characters in the episode. \\"The Simpsons Guy\\" was met with a mixed reception by critics, who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined. Plot Peter creates a comic for the Quahog newspaper; its misogynistic humor angers local women. The Griffin family flees Quahog to escape their ire. Their car is stolen, leaving them stranded outside Springfield. At the Kwik-E- Mart, Homer Simpson introduces himself and takes them to the Springfield Police Department, where they are turned away by Chief Wiggum. The Simpson family puts up the Griffins in their home. Bart shows Stewie his slingshot, and teaches him how to skateboard, and they become friends. When Nelson Muntz bullies Bart, Stewie tortures Nelson. Lisa tries to find Meg's talent. When she realizes Meg is a natural at the saxophone, she downplays it. Chris and Brian take Santa's Little Helper for a walk. Brian tries teaching Santa's Little Helper independence, but he runs away. Marge notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he returns. Homer and Peter unsuccessfully try to find Peter's car, discovering it in the possession of Hans Moleman when he accidentally runs Peter over. The men celebrate at Moe's Tavern, but relationships sour when Peter introduces Homer to Pawtucket Patriot ale. The drink is revealed to be an imitation of Duff Beer with a new label. Duff, represented by the Blue Haired Lawyer, files a lawsuit against Pawtucket Brewery for patent infringement, with Peter forced to defend the brewery to save Quahog. Fred Flintstone presides over the case. Similar characters from both shows interact with each other. Fred rules in favor of Duff Beer, but declares that both Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer are imitations of Bud Rock. The Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming no room for more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violence and ends their friendship. Homer tries explaining his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight. Eventually they admit their admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie pretends he is over Bart, but in his room writes \\"I will not think about Bart anymore\\" several times on a chalkboard. Production =Development= Five of the six main voice actors from The Simpsons reprised their roles in this episode. From left to right: Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner. Hank Azaria is not pictured. The idea of a crossover with The Simpsons was first suggested while the thirteenth season of Family Guy was being planned out. Executive producer Richard Appel received Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from Simpsons executive producers Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on The Simpsons for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, and Hank Azaria guest star as their Simpsons characters, but Harry Shearer, the final main cast member of The Simpsons, was unavailable. Asked how he felt about the crossover, Shearer replied, \\"Matter and anti-matter.\\" Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, including one in which the Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield‚Äîchanges included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright‚Äîand animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that \\"by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox.\\" =Announcement and promotion= The episode was first announced by Fox in July 2013 to premiere in the fall of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is \\"really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other.\\" The Simpsons creator Groening added, \\"In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out\\". \\"The Simpsons Guy\\" includes cameo appearances by Roger of American Dad!, Bob Belcher of Bob's Burgers, and Fred Flintstone of The Flintstones. The episode also pokes fun at the different characters' skin colors; upon entering Springfield, Peter warns the family not to drink the water because all the citizens appear to have hepatitis, while Homer refers to the Griffin family as \\"our albino visitors\\". The Springfield Gorge scene in Homer and Peter's fight sequence is a reference to the finale of the season two episode \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" in which Homer inadvertently ends up jumping the Gorge on Bart's skateboard. Reception The episode was watched by 8.45 million people. This was slightly more than the second season premiere of Resurrection on ABC but less than The Good Wife on CBS, both shows in the same timeslot. \\"Clown in the Dumps\\", the earlier premiere of the twenty-sixth season of The Simpsons was watched by 8.53 million. =Critical reception= \\"The Simpsons Guy\\" received mixed reviews. Writing in USA Today, Mike Foss gave the episode a positive review, but criticized how the episode was written by Family Guy staff and thus lacked elements of The Simpsons humor. Jason Hughes of TheWrap was also generally in praise of the episode, but felt that certain scenes‚Äîincluding both Peter and Homer's fight and an erotic car wash sequence‚Äîwere \\"squeamish\\" and out of place for The Simpsons. He however acknowledged that Bart's disgust at Stewie's behavior was \\"a good statement\\" of the difference between the two shows. Positive reviews of the crossover also came from IGN, the International Business Times, the Standard-Examiner, and TVLine. Other critics responded negatively. Scott Meslow, of The Week, pointed out his disappointment that the episode parodied a scene in \\"Bart the Daredevil\\", as that episode dealt with Homer and Bart's relationship, but \\"The Simpsons Guy\\" used it as a joke in a violent sequence. Emily VanDerWerff wrote on Vox that while she expected the episode to be mediocre, it actually ended up a \\"blight on humanity itself\\". She listed nine reasons for this statement, including her dissatisfaction with the car wash and fight scenes, and the use of sexist jokes which had lost their shock value. After the episode aired in the United Kingdom in July 2015, Ellen E. Jones, of The Independent, criticized the episode's rape jokes and violence, and theorized that with the poor box-office performance of his latest film Ted 2, audiences were growing tired of MacFarlane's humor. Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph, however, wrote that Family Guys usual objectionable content was restrained in the episode, as if it had been \\"infected\\" by recent seasons of The Simpsons. The A.V. Club named the episode among \\"The worst TV of 2014\\" under \\"Worst crossover\\", writing that \\"for no real reason, Homer and Peter find themselves in an interminable 'sexy car wash' montage, sudsing and squirting each other in tied-off tees and denim cutoffs. Family Guy prides itself on cutaway gags, but the car-wash scene... is its most successful look-away gag\\". =Controversy= \\"The Simpsons Guy\\" attracted controversy before it had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking for a man with an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it \\"less outrageous in real life\\", and that people who watch The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment on the joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was \\"pretty funny... in context\\". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said \\"I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke.\\" The Parents Television Council declared the episode worst show of the week, saying that it was significantly distasteful to involve The Simpsons because although that series is rated PG, Family Guy aims \\"to reach the most extreme and outlandish conclusion of any joke, no matter how harsh the punchline may be. For subjecting viewers to jokes about rape, cartoon nudity, and disturbing acts of violence, Fox's Family Guy will remain the Worst TV Show of the Week\\".

It allows that one can respect the explanations and results of the successful sciences without supposing that the sciences are our only resource for understanding humanity and our dealings with the world and each other. The term \\"liberal naturalism\\" was introduced in 2004 by Mario De Caro & David MacarthurDe Caro, M. & Macarthur, D. Naturalism in Question (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, April 2004), p. 1. and, independently, by Gregg Rosenberg.Rosenberg, Gregg, A Place for Consciousness: Probing the Deep Structure of the Natural World (Oxford: Oxford University Press, November 2004), p. 77. This form of naturalism has been ascribed to Immanuel Kant.Hanna, Robert, Kant, Science, and Human Nature. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16. Overview For a liberal naturalist many things in our everyday world that are not explicable (or not fully explicable) by science are, nonetheless, presupposed by science‚Äîe.g. tables, persons, artworks, institutions, rational norms and values. Explaining such things might require non-scientific non-supernatural resources according to this form of naturalism. So, rather than tailoring their ontology to the posits of the successful sciences, as scientific naturalists do, liberal naturalists recognise the prima facie irreducible reality of everyday objects that are part of what Wilfrid Sellars called \\"the manifest image\\".Sellars, W.

Mind and World (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 2004). # It attempts to provide a non-reductive non- supernatural account of the rational or conceptual normativity to which we are responsive in theoretical and practical reasoning, e.g., by appeal to the Hegelian or pragmatist idea of mutual acknowledgement in a community;Macarthur, D. \\"Pragmatism, Metaphysical Quietism and the Problem of Normativity\\" in Philosophical Topics, vol 36 no. 1 (2008). # It challenges the widely influential Quinean thesis that philosophy, when properly naturalized, must limit itself to the methods of the successful sciences.Quine, W.

The average pore size of MMCs can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis conditions.Cheung O, Zhang P, Frykstrand, S, et al.

RSC Advances 6, 74241-74249 (2016). doi:10.1039/C6RA14171D So far, all reported forms of MMCs are anhydrous and X-ray amorphous. As with other types of mesoporous materials, the large surface area and the nanometer sized pores in makes MMCs interesting in a number of applications. In addition, MMC has excellent hygroscopic properties. The pores are formed via expanding CO2 gas during synthesis, no other templating molecules are needed to form the mesoporous network in the material. The first patent on MMCs was granted in 2017,Str√∂mme M, Mihranyan A, G√≥mez de la Torre J, Frykstrand S. Anhydrous, amorphous and porous magnesium carbonates and methods of production thereof, US9580330B2. Available at: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9580330B2 and it is now being commercialized by the spin-out company Disruptive Materials AB in Uppsala, Sweden, for applications within cosmetics, sport products and other technical areas. MMCs is also being investigated within pharmaceutical applications.  Naming  In the first publications on mesoporous magnesium carbonate, the material was given the name Upsalite as a reference to Uppsala University and the city of Uppsala, using the latin spelling with one p. Today, Upsalite is a registered trademark, and in general the material class is designated as mesoporous magnesium carbonates. Synthesis The general type of MMC is synthesized by reacting magnesium oxide (MgO) and methanol under a carbon dioxide (CO2) pressure.Frykstrand S, Forsgren J, Mihranyan A, Str√∂mme M. On the pore-forming mechanism of Upsalite, a micro- and mesoporous magnesium carbonate, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 190, 99-104 (2014). doi:10.1016/j.micromeso.2013.12.011 Stirring and depressurization of the product results in an alcogel that swell as CO2 gas expand and is released. When physically bound CO2 is released, and residual methanol is evaporated from the gel upon heat treatment at moderate temperatures, the gel solidifies, and a porous network is formed in the material. The average pore diameter in the final product can be controlled by adjusting the energy input during the solidification process.  Structure  MMCs are composed of an X-ray amorphous and mesoporous MgCO3 matrix with crystals of MgO embedded in the structure.

Amorphous drugs generally exhibit higher solubilities than their crystalline counterparts, and by stabilizing drugs in their amorphous state in the drug formulation, a higher solubility can be obtained at administration.Forsgren J, Andersson M, Nilsson P, Mihranyan A.

Advanced Healthcare Materials 2, 1469-1476. doi:10.1002/adhm.201200391 Poor aqueous solubility limits the bioavailability of many drugs, and thus their therapeutic effect. The release of drugs from MMCs can be tuned via particle size and pore size. The release rate can also be tuned via chemical modification of the pore walls. It has been shown that supersaturation of drugs formulated with MMCs can be enhanced, both in terms of drug solubility and time-period for supersaturation, by addition of the polymers during release.  Sports  Due to its ability to adsorb moisture, MMCs can be used by climbers and other athletes to enhance grip. MMC under the brand name Upsalite, was introduced on the global market as an ingredient in climbing chalk, in 2018 by the company Black Diamond. When first presented on the world's largest sports exhibit ISPO, it was awarded best new and innovative climbing accessory 2018.ISPO. ISPO awards 2018. Available at: https://www.ispo.com/en/awards/ispo- award/winners/2018/outdoor#!ts-76506-t-76421 [accessed on October 23, 2018]  Humidity control  As MMCs are found to adsorb more water at low relative humidities compared to the best materials previously available, the hygroscopic zeolites, they can be used to keep humidity at extremely low levels where needed. Further, upsalite can release that water at lower temperatures than zeolites, requiring less energy. Other potential uses MMC can also be potentially used for collection of toxic waste, chemicals or oil spill and for odor control, sanitation after fire, and the collection of water from any source containing it.

It is one of Belgium's ten public holidays and marks the anniversary of the investiture of King Leopold I, the country's first monarch, in 1831. History In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, Belgium became part of the United Netherlands. After a period of growing unrest, the Belgian Revolution forced Dutch forces out of the country between August and October 1830. By November, the different revolutionary factions had coalesced around the idea of national independence and began drafting a constitution for an independent Belgian state. It was decided that it would become a constitutional and popular monarchy, reflecting the romantic nationalism popular at the time. Searching for a monarch, the revolutionaries decided on Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha who was a German aristocrat popular in the United Kingdom. Leopold arrived in Brussels in early July 1831 and, on 21 July, swore allegiance to the constitution, becoming the country's first monarch. 21 July 1831 is thus considered to mark the start of the modern Kingdom of Belgium. Belgian National Day was originally celebrated on 27 September, date of the expulsion of Dutch forces from Brussels during the Revolution's \\"September Days\\". In 1890, this was changed by law to 21 July to strengthen the association between the observance and the monarchy and constitutional order. Since 1991, 27 September has become the official observance of the French Community of Belgium. In World War I and World War II, Belgium was occupied and public displays of patriotism were banned. As a result, celebrations of 21 July became a common form of symbolic resistance. Programme Belgian National Day is celebrated across Belgium and in Belgian emigrant communities abroad on 21 July. It is a public holiday, being one of ten observed nationally each year. Historically, National Day is marked by a televised speech by the King. The main festivities occur in Brussels. They traditionally begin with a Te Deum at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, attended by the King and other dignitaries. In the afternoon, the Belgian Armed Forces and police are reviewed by the King and parade around the Rue de la Loi and around the perimeter of the Brussels Park in front of the Royal Palace. Foreign contingents from Belgium's European Union and NATO allies have also participated. Refreshments and displays by Belgium's public and emergency services, armed forces, charities, and civic associations are set up for the public in the Park and nearby Place Royale, Rue de la R√©gence and Place Poelart. There is also a flypast by the Belgian Air Force. In the evening, there is a fireworks display. Since 2003, there has also been a concert known as the \\"National Ball\\" (bal nationale). In 2019, the festivities in Brussels were attended by an estimated 100,000 people. Elsewhere in Belgium, celebrations often involve church services, flea markets, and public concerts. Belgian flags are commonly displayed by shops and private houses. Belgium's climate means that rain is common on National Day and is popularly referred to in French as the \\"National Downpour\\" (drache nationale). Notable events On National Day 2013, King Philippe formally ascended to the throne following the abdication of his father Albert II.

Singaporean-Chinese comedy film produced and directed by Jack Neo, written by Neo, Lim Teck and Leonard Lai. It is the second of two cinematic parts. It was released on February 1, 2013. It is the highest-grossing Singaporean film of all time, and has grossed over four times of its S$3 million budget. A third installment titled Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen was announced by Jack Neo to be scheduled for production in August 2014 based on the story of a group of navy boys. Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen was released in cinemas on February 19, 2015. Plot Following the events of the first film, Ken's father is revealed to have become partially paralyzed because of his stroke but is determined to make a recovery. Regretting his selfish actions, Ken adopts a quick change in personality by becoming an \\"on- the-ball\\" recruit, even more so than \\"Wayang King\\" Aloysius. While Ken's changes initially impresses the officers and sergeants while drawing bemusement from his mates, Aloysius begins to feel that he would lose the \\"Best Recruit\\" status to Ken. After a physical exercise one day, Aloysius butts in when their platoon Sergeant asks Ken to explain his improvements and ends up costing his fellow recruits their smoking breaks. This causes him to be \\"marked\\" by them as they outcast him and make his life miserable. Ken's attempt to defend him sours the friendship between himself and Lobang, the latter leading the group's attacks on Aloysius. After booking out, Aloysius seeks advice from his parents; his father (Chen Tianwen) tells him the best solution is not to do anything. Back at Tekong, Recruit IP Man learns about \\"Real Bullet\\" Zhen Zi Dan (Benjamin Mok), an \\"Ah Beng\\" who stole his girlfriend Mayoki (Sherraine Law). IP Man hits back by criticizing Mayoki for her inferior qualities. \\"Real Bullet\\" in turn uploads a video of him and Mayoki engaging in an intimate act. Crestfallen, IP Man seeks help from his bunk mates; Lobang plots a successful scheme to ambush \\"Real Bullet\\" and Mayoki at a car-park by throwing heaps of human excretion mixed with chilli and wasabi at them while they are in the car; but Ken and Aloysius are uninvolved. However, a gang soon chases after them after \\"Real Bullet\\" calls for back-up, but at last the recruits manage to shake the gang off and they celebrate at a restaurant at White Sands later that evening. However, at the restaurant, they are ambushed by more gang members, who have managed to track them down. Ken runs back to save his mates, following the principle \\"Leave no man behind\\", unlike Aloysius, who is quick to flee. Because Ken saved his life, Lobang vows to stop smoking in return and their friendship is mended. After an investigation by the sergeants, Ken and the perpetrators of the earlier scheme carried out that day are told they won't have charges pressed on them, but will still be punished. Ken's concerned parents speak to CPT Tham after learning about what had happened. His father has shown visible signs of improvement and is starting to be able to talk, thanks the Officer Commanding (OC) for training Ken to become a \\"real soldier\\", but is against him being punished for fighting when he was trying to do the right thing. The OC agrees to make an exception and exclude Ken from punishment. Ken, though, after learning that the others still would be punished, is granted permission to continue his punishment. Aloysius, meanwhile, continues to draw flak from his mates for his cowardice. Later, Lobang attempts to sabotage Aloysius for abandoning the team earlier on by throwing his rifle magazine but after a comical turn of events, it is Lobang who loses his own magazine. However, Aloysius quickly gives his magazine to Lobang during an equipment check and takes the blame. While searching for the missing magazine, the relationship between the two grow better. The eccentric Lieutenant S.T. Choong (mrbrown) is chased by a large herd of wild boars halfway into an assessment for leadership potential; the soldiers are quick to come to his rescue. Following their passing out parade, the recruits reunite with their kin. Ken's father is present and comes to greet Ken; he is finally able to walk steadily without any aid. As the film ends, various recruits' postings are shown ‚Äî with Lobang being posted to Officer Cadet School (OCS), and Aloysius being posted to Specialist Cadet School (SCS). Ken also goes to Specialist Cadet School, later being posted to Officer Cadet School.

Ah Boys to Men 2 focuses more on the unity of the protagonists, as well as tapping more on hot social topics like foreign talent in Singapore. It gave \\"a stronger story than its predecessor\\", and had a \\"more meaty\\" drama aspect, according to Jack Neo. Other themes for part two include \\"[...] sacrifice, love, family and patriotism\\". Production =Music= Theme song The official theme song of Ah Boys to Men 2, titled \\"Brothers\\", was written, composed and performed by Tosh Zhang, a YouTube personality who is part of the cast in the film. An official music video was uploaded on YouTube on January 24, 2013. Release The trailer for part two was showcased at the Asia TV Forum & Market and ScreenSingapore 2012 from December 4, 2012 to December 7, 2012. Within a week of its upload online, the trailer had already amassed approximately 20 million views. Earlier reports gave the release date for the full film as January 31, 2013 and February 7, 2013. However, the official commercial release date for part two in Singaporean cinemas was later confirmed as February 1, 2013. Ah Boys to Men 2 premiered on January 30, 2013, two days before its commercial release, at the Festive Grand Theatre at Resorts World Sentosa ‚Äì the first local film to do so. It was released in Malaysian cinemas on March 14, 2013. Home media Ah Boys to Men 2 was released on DVD on 30 April 2013. Reception =Critical response= Ah Boys to Men 2 garnered mixed reviews from critics, similar to its predecessor. In contrast to his review for part one, in which he called it a \\"misfire\\", Travis Wong of insing.com called part two a \\"perfect salute\\" and gave it 2 stars out of 5. Mervin Tay of The New Paper said that the second part \\"has the usual trappings of a Jack Neo movie, but with a context that will resonate with anyone who has been through national service, a rite of passage for all male Singaporeans and their families.\\" TODAY Christopher Toh wrote that it \\"isn't all bad but lacks a big payoff\\" and gave it 3 stars out of 5. Gabriel Chong of Movie Exclusive gave it 3.5 stars. She said that it was not \\"a perfect movie by any measure\\", but that it \\"still manages to tap onto the perfectly relatable and uniquely Singaporean experience of BMT for a moving portrayal of the bond of brotherhood forged through that unforgettable rite of passage.\\" Writing for F Movie Mag was Shawne Wang, who gave it a negative review of 1.5 stars out of a possible 5. She labelled it a \\"misfire in practically every way\\". Dylan Tan of The Business Times felt that there was no improvement in the plot and it was the \\"same old drill\\". A Time Out Singapore reviewer commented that the film was \\"wrapped up in a heart-warming message\\". Channel News Asia called it an \\"enjoyable film with problems\\", giving a score of 3 out of 5 stars and citing the heavy product placement and over-emphasis on details as some of the situations that needed improvement. =Box office= Domestic Neo has anticipated that the second part would \\"do much better than the first one\\" and has also announced his consideration to produce more army-themed films. At a press conference for part two of Ah Boys to Men, Neo said: \\"I anticipate that Part 2 will do much better than the first one and I hope that we will hit S$7 million this time.\\" Part two out-grossed part one in terms of opening weekend earnings; it earned S$1.51 million in its opening weekend, thus breaking the record for the highest box office earnings for local productions, which was previously set by part one in 2012. It took in S$2.7 million over the Chinese New Year weekend period; on February 20, 2013, part two of Ah Boys to Men overtook part one in box office takings by grossing S$6.297 million and becoming the highest-grossing Singaporean film. As of February 26, 2013, part two has grossed S$7.08 million. The film's overwhelming success has been seen as a \\"gift from Heaven\\" by Neo. Third installment The project had originally been envisaged as just two parts until after the release of the second part. Buoyed by \\"non-stop\\" requests for another sequel, Jack Neo confirmed on February 20, 2013 that he had begun working on one under the working title Ah Boys to Men 3, though actual filming would only take place after 2013. Neo posted on his Twitter account (in Chinese): In a later interview with Channel NewsAsia, Neo admitted that \\"I have been really reluctant to tell people that I'll be working on a third film, because I know people's expectations will only get higher after the first two.\\" Neo said that he was still pondering on the storyline and also needed time for research. At a promotional tour in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for part two, Neo announced that possible cast for part three included Henry Thia and Mark Lee and that \\"we are currently preparing for the shoot\\". During which he also \\"officially announced\\": A spin-off to the Ah Boys to Men film franchise titled Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen was announced by Jack Neo to be scheduled for production in August 2014 based on the story of a group of navy boys.

The film stars Lily Collins and Sam Claflin, with Christian Cooke, Tamsin Egerton, Suki Waterhouse, Jamie Beamish and Jaime Winstone in supporting roles. Plot Alex and Rosie have been best friends for almost as long as they can remember. During Rosie's 18th birthday party, Alex kisses Rosie, who is drunk, and he realizes that he has romantic feelings for her. The next day, while nursing a hangover and having had her stomach pumped, Rosie regrets having got drunk, and tells Alex that she wishes that the night had never happened. Alex interprets her words as Rosie just wanting to be friends. Greg, the \\"fittest guy in their year\\", asks Rosie to the school dance. While she originally intended to go with Alex, she accepts Greg's offer when she learns that Alex is thinking about going to the dance with a girl named Bethany. After the dance, Rosie has sex with Greg, but the condom slips off inside her. Rosie aspires to one day run her own hotel, and applies and gets accepted to a hotel management course at Boston University. She rushes to tell Alex but finds him having sex with Bethany, which causes her to vomit. Rosie discovers that she is pregnant but refuses to tell Alex, fearing that he will forgo his chance to study at Harvard to help take care of her. After Alex leaves for the United States, she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Katie. Alex learns of Rosie's pregnancy from Bethany and becomes Katie's godfather. Five years later, Rosie visits Alex in Boston and they spend a night together talking and visiting places. The following morning, she discovers that his girlfriend is pregnant. She understands that Alex's living situation was not proper and tries to discuss it with him but he rebuffs her, saying that at least their child will have both parents. Infuriated, Rosie leaves Boston immediately. She reconciles with Greg, who had initially fled to Ibiza upon learning of her pregnancy, and the two eventually marry in 2009. Later, Rosie learns that Alex split from his girlfriend after discovering that the baby was not his. She bumps into Bethany, now a famous model, and suggests that Bethany look up Alex on an upcoming trip to the US. Another five years pass. Rosie's father dies. Alex attends the funeral, where he reconciles with Rosie. At the same event, Greg behaves immaturely, causing a scene. This later prompts Alex to write Rosie a note saying that she deserves better and that he can be that better man. However, Greg intercepts the note and hides it from Rosie. Later, Rosie discovers that Greg is cheating on her and kicks him out. While disposing of his things, she finds the letter from Alex. She calls him, but discovers that Bethany is living with him now and that the two are engaged. They invite Rosie to be the \\"best man\\" at their wedding. Rosie plots to interrupt the wedding, but fails, as the church ceremony is over by the time she arrives. At the reception, Rosie gives a speech, telling Alex that she loves him as a friend. Her daughter, Katie, brings a friend named Toby with her to the wedding, in a friendship that is reminiscent of Rosie and Alex when they were children. During a dance, Toby suddenly kisses Katie, but Katie pushes him away and runs outside. Rosie and Alex follow her. Alex counsels her and tells her to follow her feelings with Toby or she might regret it, alluding to how he felt about Rosie. After a moment, Toby finds Katie and apologizes for what he did. As he asks her to forget what just happened, Katie interrupts him with a kiss. In that moment, Alex learns that Rosie does not remember the kiss that they shared on her 18th birthday. He realizes that he had been mistaken in interpreting her desire to forget that night as her wanting to stay platonic. Using her inheritance from her father, Rosie finally fulfills her ambition to start her own hotel. Alex is her second guest. When he arrives, he tells Rosie that he ended his marriage with Bethany, and shares with her a recurring dream he has had about the two of them being together. Finally, they kiss.

It is the sixteenth title in the Ace Combat series, and was released worldwide in May 2014. It is the first free-to-play title in the series, and unlike most games in the series, Infinity takes place on Earth. However, it includes certain elements from past Ace Combat games, including historical events, organizations, superweapons, and original aircraft. Bandai Namco ceased all of the game's services on March 31, 2018. Gameplay The game has three modes - story, tutorial, and the multiplayer deathmatch/cooperative mode. Players log on to the game itself through their PlayStation Network accounts. To fly in the story or multiplayer missions, the player will use one fuel credit; three Supplied Fuel units are rechargeable after a set period of time while Stocked Fuel credits are available as a mission reward or bought at the PlayStation Store. A lobby system allows the players to go through eight story missions and 39 multiplayer missions, with a few being Special Raid Missions that involve players taking on superweapons. Infinity has around 50 licensed jet aircraft representing modern designs from the United States, Europe, and Russia, with the F-4 Phantom as the player's first plane. Further updates since the game's release gave players a chance to use some of the Ace Combat franchise's iconic superfighters as well as the Japanese ATD-0 Shinshin technology demonstrator. As they play through the game, they can earn enough experience points to advance in rank and in the global leaderboards for every tournament. The game's mission reward system is based on drops of red or gold boxes; aside from possibly earning one, three, or five Stocked Fuel credits, players can win small amounts of credit, aircraft paint schemes and logos, Supply Ticket virtual coupons, and higher-performance versions of existing airplanes. The Supply Tickets are to be exchanged in a game catalogue for certain special airplanes (except for aircraft that are tournament rewards), skins and logos, radio messages, and nicknames. Players will also have a chance to research upgrades to their current aircraft through a special development tree, which will include options for new aircraft, aircraft parts, and weapons. The special aircraft, skins and logos include those from other Ace Combat titles, including the original Scarface Squadron (Phoenix) skins from the first Ace Combat game as well as those from notable air combat franchises such as Area 88 and Namco's own game franchises. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the JASDF, Namco Bandai included a special F-15J & F-2A that were featured at the 2014 Air Festival at Misawa Air Base in Japan. The US Department of Defense also authorized the use of the VF-84/VF-103 Jolly Roger high-visibility paint schemes for the F-14D and F/A-18F, the VMFA-232 skin for the F/A-18F, as well as renditions of the F-117, F-15C & F-16C in US flag livery. In mid September 2015, the game's 11th update was released and introduced piston fighters from the Second World War such as the P-38 Lightning, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Supermarine Spitfire and the A6M Zero Plot =Setting and characters= Ace Combat Infinity is set in an alternate timeline, in which Earth was ravaged by the \\"Ulysses Disaster.\\" In 1994, a fictional asteroid collides with one of Jupiter's moons, 5254 Ulysses. This event sends about 10,000 meteors heading for Earth, all expected to impact the planet in five years' time. Faced with the prospect of extinction, the world's major superpowers build \\"Stonehenge,\\" a network of anti-air railguns across the planet. The meteor storm finally hits Earth in July 1999. While Stonehenge destroys enough of the inbound meteors to prevent human extinction, the remaining meteors still ravaged about 20% of the Earth's surface, destabilizing the economy and collapsing the world order. The disaster hits Europe and Asia especially hard, forcing the nations to reorganize and create automated refugee zones. Twenty years later, the United Nations Forces find itself fighting against terrorist organizations around the world. To better combat the terrorist threat, the UN hires Arrows Air Defense and Security, a private military company specializing in aerial warfare. The player character and silent protagonist, callsign \\"Reaper,\\" is a rookie pilot employed by Arrows. Arrows assigns Reaper to the \\"Bone Arrow\\" squadron, which includes long-time pilot \\"Omega\\" and ace veteran \\"Viper.\\" Part-way through the story, Bone Arrow becomes rivals with Ridgeback Squadron, a squadron of elite UNF pilots headed by leader \\"Slash\\" and his second-in-command, \\"Edge.\\" The main antagonist forces are the Sons of Troia, a group of armed terrorists who later create an independent \\"Federation of USEA\\" or USEA Federation. Reaper's actions against the Sons of Troia and USEA soon make him a recognized mercenary ace pilot. Elements in the game, such as the Ulysses disaster, the Stonehenge superweapon and the rise of the USEA enemy faction (a new multinational military federation (the \\"United States of EurAsia\\"), rather than a fictional continent), are direct references to Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies but played on Earth instead of \\"Strangereal,\\" the fictional planet setting of previous Ace Combat games. Furthermore, the player character taking the role of a mercenary pilot of a private military company hired by the UN to keep the \\"post-Ulysses\\" world stable to regional dispute and terrorist attacks, is similar to the storyline of Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War. Other elements, including fictional aircraft, names of locales and specific mission settings, reference elements of previous games in the franchise. =Plot= In early 2019, Reaper, a new recruit for the Arrows PMC's \\"Bone Arrows\\" Squadron, is deployed for his first mission in Tokyo, working with teammate Omega to destroy several UAVs attacking the UNF Pacific Fleet stationed in the harbor. The two are subsequently redeployed, alongside veteran pilot Viper, to defend the Comona Aerospace Center in the West Indies against another airstrike. Evidence points to the aircraft being used by a terrorist group called the \\"Sons of Troia,\\" but other materials bear the markings of an international company called Wernher-Noah Enterprises, which denies involvement. The Bone Arrows join the UN Forces in a rescue operation to save the \\"Greymen,\\" a top circle of world leaders who were kidnapped by the Sons of Troia and held somewhere in the Iyuli refugee zone in Russia. The UN troops reach the Greymen's purported location, but the hostages are nowhere to be found - and are promptly surprised by a barrage of railgun fire. The Bone Arrows and the UN's elite \\"Ridgeback\\" team are among the UN units able to escape the area. The UN confirms that the shots came from a Turkish Stonehenge Type-3 base, captured by the Sons of Troia prior to the rescue operation. The Bone Arrows, the Ridgebacks, and the UN Marines work together to destroy the gun installation, with \\"Reaper,\\" gradually gaining a reputation. The Sons of Troia make a public statement after the Stonehenge raid through its leader Kacper Cohen, a former Wernher-Noah executive fired by the UN for working on a secret space weapons project. Cohen claims the UN has been fully concentrated on the wishes of the world's superpowers, not the Ulysses refugees. Having executed the nine Greymen, he declares the creation of the United States of Eurasia (USEA), a federation of multiple nations across the southern Eurasian continent. All military forces in southern Eurasia pledge loyalty to the USEA and take over their occupying regions; the UN, slow to respond and few in number, sends all of their forces to counterattack the USEA forces in Dubai and Tokyo. Bone Arrow and the Ridgebacks fly to Tokyo to aid the UNF assault but run into tough opposition led by a large airborne fortress and an advanced aircraft - known as the \\"Butterfly Master\\" - controlling laser-armed drones. During the battle, Slash ejects but is killed by the drones; his wingman, Edge, is enraged, and it takes Viper to restrain her. Reaper takes down the Butterfly Master and leads the assault against the airborne command cruiser. The UNF liberates Tokyo and forces the Useans to retreat. Having taken heavy losses in the operation, the Arrows accept the UNF's offer to join Task Force 118 \\"Arrowblades,\\" a special combat force to take on the USEA army alongside the Ridgebacks and several mercenary units. Their first mission is to attack an ICBM launch facility located in Russia's (fictional) Avalon Dam. With an AL-1B missile interceptor providing cover to stop any missile launches, the Arrowblades forces stream through a canyon to attack Avalon Dam and have the UN Marines open the silo doors. However, despite destroying the ICBMs, the strike team is caught off-guard by another, hidden ICBM prepared for launch against Washington, D.C.; all remaining planes successfully shoot down the missile. Upon returning to base, they find out that the USEA forces want to bring the war to the United States, and that the AL-1B had been mysteriously shot down. In May 2020, the UNF scrambles Task Force 118 from their base in San Diego to intercept a large wave of USEA planes that took off from South America, and encounter them over Area B7R in Nevada. Edge is badly hit throughout the battle and is forced to withdraw. The UNF planes pull out after defeating all enemy aircraft, but the Butterfly Master - believed killed in the Tokyo operation - reappears with a formation of drones. The Arrowblades destroy the Butterfly Master's plane but learn that it is also a combat drone, and its remote pilot remains alive. Five months later, Task Force 118 and the UNF take the fight to the USEA by launching Operation Bunker Shot, an amphibious operation targeting USEA territory in Eastern Europe. The landing forces who come ashore in Croatia are attacked by an orbital weapon - revealed to be the project Cohen was working on. The remainder of the UNF invasion force breaks through, and the USEA forces withdraw, signifying the start of a long campaign to defeat the USEA. The game's final cutscene revealed to players that the Butterfly Master was actually a young girl situated in a satellite in a Low Earth Orbit. Development Infinity had a lengthy teaser campaign by Bandai Namco and Kazutoki Kono (director of Ace Combat: Assault Horizon), consisting of posts from the Twitter accounts of Project Aces and Kono along with a website for the game published on July 11, giving various hints to fans of the series to decipher. The game's title and certain vague details were announced through a 46-second trailer released on July 19, 2013. On August 2, 2013, a second teaser trailer was released containing more information on the game's single-player elements. The second trailer confirmed that the Stonehenge railgun network from Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies, along with the \\"Estovakian Aerial Fleet\\" (composed of numerous aerial fortresses) from Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, would make an appearance in Infinity. In addition, an AWACS unit codenamed Sky-Eye was to be a recurring character, also referencing Ace Combat 04. The game itself was simultaneously announced on Bandai Namco Games Europe's website, where it was also revealed that the game would use the free-to-play model (the first in the series to do so). Olivier Comte, Senior Vice President of BANDAI NAMCO Games Europe, said, \\"The Ace Combat franchise has evolved dramatically over the years, but never before have we been able to offer its amazing graphics and tactical action for free. The team at Project Aces listens very carefully to its players, and is bringing the best the series has to offer to ACE COMBAT INFINITY, with plenty of new surprises too.\\" On February 4, 2014 (after a false start in November and a Japan-only beta in December), a week-long beta for Infinity was publicly released worldwide. It featured the first two missions from the single player campaign and a work-in-progress competitive multiplayer mode. Players could submit feedback to the development team during the beta phase, which went into consideration during the production of the final release. The game became officially available worldwide in May 2014. Reception Ace Combat Infinity has a score of 54% on Metacritic. GameSpot awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying \\"The soaring bird that has long served as the metaphor for the Ace Combat pilot becomes a vulture fighting over highway carrion, looping away incautiously when the odd car passes a little too close, before returning again for a final few scraps of flesh.\\" Notes References External links * Category:2014 video games Category:Products and services discontinued in 2018 Category:Ace Combat Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:Free-to-play video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Video games about artificial intelligence Category:Aerial warfare in fiction Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Meteoroids in fiction Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in the Caribbean Category:Video games set in Nevada Category:Video games set in Russia Category:Video games set in Tokyo Category:Video games set in Turkey Category:Video games set in 2019 ","title":"Ace Combat Infinity"},{"id":"40008475","text":"Stephen Reville D.D., O.S.A.

On 17 July 2013 the International Crimes Tribunal found Mojaheed responsible for the killings and sentenced him for life. In 2015, a four-judge bench of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment.  Background  The village of Bakchar fell under Faridpur Kotwali police station in 1971. It is currently a part of Majchar Union of Faridpur Sadar Upazila in Faridpur District. On 21 April 1971, the Pakistan Army arrived in Faridpur. They began killing the Hindu population with the help from local collaborators. The decision to attack Bakchar village was taken at a Peace Committee meeting.  Killings  On 13 May, the Razakar forces attacked the Hindu inhabited portion of the Bakchar village and arrested nine Hindus namely Birendra Saha, Nripen Saha, Shanu Saha, Jagabandhu Mitra, Jaladhar Mitra, Satya Ranjan Das, Niradbandhu Mitra, Prafulla Mitra and Upen Saha. The latter's wife wanted to free her husband by paying cash and gold to the Razakars but her efforts went in vain. The Razakars massacred all the nine arrested Hindus. The Razakars also raped Jhuma Rani Saha, the daughter of Sunil Kumar Saha and killed her. They forced Anil Saha to leave the country.  Aftermath  Chitta Saha, a resident of Bakchar and witness to the massacre provided testimony at the tribunal during the prosecution of Mojaheed. When the Supreme Court reduced the verdict from death penalty to life imprisonment, the victims and the residents of Bakchar village were unhappy with it.

Manufactured by Great Coasters International (GCI), White Lightning opened to the public on June 8, 2013, as the first wooden coaster to be built in Orlando. Unlike traditional wood designs, the support structure is made of steel to reduce maintenance costs, and it was the first time GCI incorporated the design into one of their coasters. White Lightning has also been well-received, consistently ranking in the top 50 among wooden roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. History On December 31, 2010, Fun Spot Action Park announced that they purchased an additional adjacent to the park, with plans to triple the size of the park adding a number of new rides. In April 2011, Fun Spot Action Park surveyed park guests about what types of attractions they would like at the park. Consensus published by the park indicated they wanted water rides and roller coasters. In August 2011, the Orlando Sentinel revealed that the park had contacted at least three roller coaster manufacturers. In November 2011, it was confirmed that the park would receive two roller coasters: one wood and one steel. The wooden roller coaster was later confirmed to be a family friendly roller coaster manufactured by Great Coasters International (GCI). In May 2012, Fun Spot Action Park announced on Theme Park Review that they would be adding White Lighting in 2013 as part of their expansion and rebranding. However, due to the availability of extra funding, the park was able incorporate more thrilling elements in the ride. After a one-year period of construction, White Lightning soft opened to the public on May 20, 2013. The park's official reopening ceremony was held on June 8, 2013. The $3.5 million ride opened as Orlando's first wooden roller coaster. Characteristics White Lightning's first drop White Lightning is a wooden roller coaster designed by Pennsylvania-based manufacturer, Great Coasters International (GCI). The ride takes riders to a height of through the use of a chain lift hill. Riders reach a top speed of on the 75-second ride. The ride operates with two Millennium Flyer trains. Each train is made up of six cars that seat pairs of riders. This is shorter than most GCI trains and allows for a faster paced ride. Riders, who must be over , are restrained in the padded seats via a lap bar. The wooden-tracked ride features steel supports, a first for GCI. Wooden roller coasters ride differently to steel roller coasters, so it was necessary for GCI to design the track approximately above the steel support structure. Traditionally manufacturers would attach the track directly to steel supports. The steel support structure was requested by the park because it would require less maintenance than a wooden one, and it could be powder-coated to stand out in the park. Ride experience White Lightning's 90 degree bank turn back White Lightning begins with a small dip out of the station and into the chain lift hill. Once at the top of the hill, the ride plunges to the left at an angle of 58¬∞. The train then traverses a small high speed hill, before entering a double up followed by a double down. The train then inclines into a 90¬∞ banked curve that dives back to the ground, sending riders back in the direction they came. Several small hills lead the ride to the final brake run and subsequently the station. Reception White Lightning has been well received. Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel stated the ride had \\"several 'Wow, this is fun' moments\\". Bevil described the ride as \\"smooth sailing\\" when compared to other wooden roller coasters, praising the ride for its many twists and air-time hills. Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review described the ride as \\"fast and fun\\" and that one shouldn't \\"judge it by its size\\". David Martin of WOFL stated he loved the ride and that the ride was a hit. Paul Ruben of Park World Magazine stated the ride is \\"not too big and it's not too small. It's just right.\\" John Arie, the owner of Fun Spot, stated GCI delivered a ride that exceed his expectations, giving it an 11 out of 10.

The Centre has a large genetic nursery, a Tissue Culture lab and facilities to accommodate 50-100 students for nature related camps. History Tarumitra, meaning \\"Friends of Trees\\" in Hindi and Sanskrit, is a student movement to protect and promote a healthy environment on Earth.Tarumitra St. Xavier's Sr. Sec. School, Raj Niwas Marg, Delhi-54 It was the effort of Jesuit Fr. Robert Athickal from St. Xavier's School, Patna and students from few schools under the leadership of Anindo Banerjee, a class IX student from Loyola High School, Patna, that the movement came into existence in 1988. In April 1989, four high school students from Loyla High School, Anindo Banerjee, Vijay Mathur, Sanjay Pandey and Jayant Chatterjee, set out on a cycle rally in North India from Patna to New Delhi to promote awareness about the environment and the movement. They met with the then vice president of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma, to present their findings. While returning, at Agra, Jayant fell seriously ill and despite attempt, could not be saved. His demise shocked the movement; however, his sacrifice for the environment made his companions to work and promote the movement with great zeal. Today, Jayant's sacrifice is one of the cornerstone of Tarumitra's foundation history, which is still remembered the same way as 30 years ago. =Growth= Invigorated by the spirit of the late Jayant Chatterjee, Tarumitra grew up with assistance from Sr. Gita SND, Principal of Hartmann High School, Fr. George Manimala S.J., the then Principal of St. Xavier's High School, Patna and Bro. Geo Pulickal, his assistant, who went out of their way to establish the organisation's firm footing. Kumar Hemant Sinha, a student of 1990 batch of St. Xavier's High School, Patna was chosen its first President. Through their efforts, the present headquarters of the movement, Tarumitra Ashram, was inaugurated by the Collector of Patna, Arvind Prasad, on 20 February 1991. In 1994, the St Xavier‚Äôs School gave Tarumitra a 10-acre plot for a plantation at Digha, Patna. The strength of Tarumitra also increased rapidly. The girls of the local Hartmann High School, under the leadership of Sr. Gita SND and Sr. Roshni SND, gave the initial fillip needed for any new organisation. Units after units of Tarumitra sprung up in various schools in and around Patna. Many college students, social activists and journalists have also joined Tarumitra in its crusade against the destruction of the environment of India.

It serviced the Massachusetts communities of Saugus, Malden, Everett, Revere, and Lynn. Beginnings The first proposal for a railroad through Saugus came from a group led by George Peabody, who pushed for a railroad from East Boston to Salem over the Saugus marshes. The plan was opposed by Saugonians, as the owners of mills located on the Saugus River feared that a proposed drawbridge over the river would interfere with ships that loaded and unloaded cargo at their wharves. In 1836, the Massachusetts General Court granted the Eastern Railroad a charter to build the Boston to Salem railroad. In an effort to tap into its competitor's market, the Boston & Maine Railroad petitioned the Massachusetts General Court in 1845 for a charter to build a railroad from Malden to Salem through Saugus, Lynnfield, and South Danvers. The plan was not approved. In 1846, Joshua Webster proposed a railroad line from Saugus to Malden that would connect with the Boston & Maine Railroad in Malden. Eastern countered by proposing a line from Lynn to Saugus Center. In 1848 the legislature approved Webster's plan and granted his group a charter for the Saugus Branch Railroad Co. Before construction began, the route was extended to Lynn Common and altered to include the Saugus neighborhood of Sweetser's Corner (now known as Cliftondale) and the Malden neighborhood of East Malden (now known as Linden). Construction began in 1850, but dragged along due to a lack of funds. Eastern believed that this new route would cost it half of its revenues because it would provide direct access to Boston, which Eastern did not offer (Eastern patrons were to transfer to ferries at East Boston). To overcome this challenge, Eastern's directors chose to purchase stock in the Saugus Branch Railroad Co. at the inflated price of $80 a share. On April 30, 1852, the Eastern Railroad Co. purchased all the rights of the Saugus Branch and assumed its operations. In October 1852, Gardiner Greene Hubbard succeeded Webster as the president of the Saugus Branch Railroad Co. Passenger service Lynn Common station on an early postcard Franklin Park station in 1907 East Saugus station in 1910 Saugus station On February 1, 1853, the Saugus Branch opened for passengers. Andrews Breed served as the Saugus Branch's first superintendent. During the early days of the Saugus Branch, four trains a day were run from Lynn Common to Edgeworth in Malden with stops in East Saugus, Saugus Center, Cliftondale, East Malden (later Linden), and Maplewood. On April 10, 1854, the original 8.4 mile route was extended to the Grand Junction line in South Malden (now Everett) and to West Lynn, where it connected with Eastern's main line. This new line gave Eastern its first direct route into Boston as well as an alternate route. The connection with the B&M; at Malden was also abandoned, though a short stub was used as an industrial siding by the B&M.; In 1855, the Saugus Branch Railroad Co. was consolidated into the Eastern Railroad Co. For the remainder of its life, Lynn was the terminus for most Saugus Branch trains, though a limited number continued to Salem until World War I. Historian Francis B. C. Bradlee would describe the Saugus Branch as \\"one of the few fortunate investments of the Eastern\\" as it gave it access to the growing suburbs of Boston. He also wrote that \\"until the coming of the electric trolley cars connecting with the Elevated Railroad, it was probably one of the best paying stretches of railroad in New England\\". By 1869, there were fourteen passenger trips a day. During the 1870s, Eastern was plagued by a series of accidents. the most notable being the Great Revere Train Wreck of 1871. In 1884 the Boston & Maine leased Eastern and in 1890 it consolidated Eastern into its system. Once B&M; took control, the Saugus Branch underwent improvements, including telegraphs for dispatching train orders and turning the line into a double track. During the 1890s, passenger service on the Saugus branch peaked. In 1893, there were 36 trips per day on the Saugus Branch. Use of the Saugus Branch in Malden slowly declined after the opening of the Boston Elevated Railway (also known as the El) in 1901. Business in the Lynn and Saugus segments was not as affected. In 1919 the El was extended to Everett and the Saugus Branch was considered for the expansion from Everett to Malden. At a legislative hearing on the issue, the B&M; opposed using the Saugus Branch because it had a freight load of 5,000 cars per year and the El wanted to purchase only the Malden segment, not the entire branch. In 1919, the number of passenger trips had fallen to sixteen a day. By the mid-1920s passenger service on the Saugus Branch decreased to twelve trips per day. The service declined even more during the Great Depression, with only three inbound trains and six outbound trains run. During World War II, use of the passenger service increased due to gasoline rationing. However, once the war was over, use once again declined. On July 29, 1948, B&M; petitioned the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (D.P.U.) to discontinue all passenger service on the Saugus Branch. B&M; reported that expenses for the Saugus Branch were $115,145 while annual passenger revenue was only $48,029. The D.P.U. rejected the petition on November 18, 1949, finding that the railroad did not show that there was a lack of public interest in maintaining the Saugus Branch. Although the branch was saved, by 1954 there were only two morning trips to Boston and two returns trips during the evening. In 1956, the B&M; ended all steam operations and began using Budd Rail Diesel Cars (also known as Buddliners or RDCs). However, the new railcars were not heavy enough to trip the signals on the Saugus Branch. In September 1957, B&M; once again petitioned the D.P.U. for permission to end passenger service on the Saugus Branch, citing extensive losses. An Essex County-wide opposition movement formed as three hundred or so commuters still used the line. In December a formal hearing was held in which both sides presented their case. Saugus Town Moderator and Essex County Commissioner C. F. Nelson Pratt was the most forceful opponent of the change and hyperbolically stated during the hearing that area residents would be forced to use \\"dog sleds\\" for winter commuting. On April 18, 1958, the DPU approved the B&M;'s petition. On May 19, 1958, the Saugus Branch saw its final scheduled passenger train. =Stations= Pleasant Hills station The Saugus Branch had eighteen stations over the course of its history. These were *West Lynn, located in Lynn on Commercial Street at the junction with the Eastern main line. *Lynn Common, located in Lynn on Western Avenue. *Raddin's, located in Lynn at Summer Street and Raddin Grove Avenue. *East Saugus, located on the Lynn/Saugus border at Lincoln Avenue. *Saugus, located in Saugus on Central Street. One of two stations still standing. *Pleasant Hills, located in Saugus on Adams Avenue. *Cliftondale, located in Saugus at 5 Eustis Street. The name Cliftondale is believed to have originated with Saugus Branch president Joshua Webster. Cliftondale later replaced Sweester's Corner as the popular name for this neighborhood. One of two stations still standing. *Franklin Park, located in Revere on Salem Street, just outside Saugus. *Linden, located in Malden on Lynn Street near Beach Street. *Broadway, located in Malden on Broadway near Eastern Avenue. *Maplewood, located in Malden on Maplewood Street near Waite Street. The name Maplewood comes from the hundreds of maple trees Joshua Webster planted on the railroad's property. *Faulkner, located in Malden on Faulkner Street. *Malden Center (also known as Malden), located in Malden on Ferry Street. Not to be confused with the MBTA station of the same name or the Malden Station on Summer Street that now serves as a restaurant. *Edgeworth, located in Malden off Medford Street, near Pearl Street. It was the terminus of the Saugus Branch from its launch in 1853 to 1854, when the Eastern Railroad successfully petitioned the legislature to have the B&M; station removed from their line. *Bell Rock, located in Malden at the foot of Converse Avenue. *West Everett, located in Everett, originally on Waters Avenue, but moved to the foot of Prescott Street in 1882. *West Street, located on West Street in Everett. *Everett Junction, located in Everett at the Revere Beach Parkway and Broadway. Formerly known as South Malden Junction. The stations of the Saugus Branch were not considered to be architecturally significant or even physically attractive. In 1933, the Malden News described them as \\"the most mousey, dilapidated, antique stations to be found this side of the land of the Hottentots\\". Later use Railroad Enthusiasts trip the Saugus Branch on April 27, 1969 After passenger service was ended, the semaphore signals were removed and the stations were sold. The line was converted to a single- track operation and still used for freight until 1993. Hopper cars delivered road salt to the state's storage area in Revere. Occasional deliveries were made to Eastern Industrial Oil Products in Saugus. In 1968 and 1969, the line was used to transport gravel from Bow, New Hampshire to Revere during construction of roadbeds for the expansion of the Northeast Expressway. Between April and November 1968, there were four trips a day from Bow to the construction site with each train carrying 48 or 60 cars. In the spring of 1969, construction resumed with two trips per day. A total of 3.5 million cubic yards of gravel were transported to the site. Construction was completed on May 27, 1969, although the new expressway (intended to become part of Interstate 95 in Massachusetts) was never finished, being cancelled due to regional opposition. On April 27, 1969, the New England division of Railroad Enthusiasts ran the North Shore Rail Ramble, a day-trip over freight lines formerly used by passenger trains, including the Saugus Branch. The Chelsea fire of October 14, 1973 caused the B&M;'s mainline to be blocked by firefighting equipment. To restore service to the North Shore, the B&M; detoured its commuter service over the Saugus Branch. Saugus Branch rails in a Malden parking lot in 2015 On December 27, 1976, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority purchased the remaining B&M; commuter assets, including rolling stock and the four active northside lines (save for the lower Haverhill Line, purchased three years earlier for the Haymarket North Extension). Included in the sale were also a number of branch lines no longer used for passenger service, including the Saugus Branch, to be landbanked for possible future service. The reactivation of the Saugus Branch was considered during the MBTA's North Shore Transit Improvements project in the 2000s, as reactivation would allow for the continued operation of MBTA Commuter Rail service as well as new rapid transit service between Revere and Salem. The North Shore Transit Improvements Project-Major Investment Study concluded that the Saugus Branch plan provided the MBTA with an option to accommodate a rapid transit system while preserving commuter rail service north of Salem, by rerouting commuter trains over the Saugus Branch and converting the Eastern Route mainline into a Blue Line branch at least as far as Lynn. However, the plan was deemed infeasible for several reasons. Unlike the Eastern Route, the Saugus Branch is curvy; it would require 15 to 20 extra minutes for commuter trains to travel, leaving them no longer time-competitive with driving. The section of the Newburyport/Rockport Line south of Salem is one of the busiest segments of mainline railroad in Massachusetts; diverting as many as 60 trains per day would pose significant environmental, social, and physical impacts to the communities along the Saugus Branch. Additionally, encroachment since 1958 would make the restoration of double track difficult, and prevent the addition of a multi-use trail. Northern Strand Community Trail The Northern Strand Community Trail in Malden in 2015 The Saugus Branch line will soon be the route of Northern Strand Community Trail, a 9-mile bicycle path and walking trail that will run through Everett, Malden, Revere, Saugus, and Lynn. On July 13, 2013, the trail entered the final stage of construction. In literature The Saugus Branch mentioned in and is part of the title of Elliot Paul's 1947 memoir Linden on the Saugus Branch. The Saugus Branch is mentioned in Samuel McChord Crothers' By the Christmas Fire. Notes :1. The charter was granted to Webster, Edward Pranker, George W. Raddin, William Parker, James Eaton, and Gilbert Haven.

The film was inspired by and is an homage to Italian cannibal films of the late 1970s and early '80s \\"cannibal boom\\", particularly Cannibal Holocaust (1980), which features a film-within-a-film titled The Green Inferno. The film follows a group of activists who are forced to fight for survival when they are captured by a cannibalistic tribe. The film was released on September 25, 2015, by Blumhouse Tilt and High Top Releasing. Plot Justine, a college freshman, becomes interested in a student social-activism group led by Alejandro and his girlfriend Kara. The group plans a trip to the Amazon rainforest to stop a petrochemical company from forest clearing and dispossessing uncontacted native tribes. The goal is to film the forest clearing crews with cell phones and stream footage to raise awareness. Justine suggests she could bring attention to the issue through her father, a United Nations attorney. The operation is funded by Carlos, a drug dealer who meets the group in Peru. They travel into the Amazon and journey by small boat to reach the construction site. On the way the group spots a black jaguar resting on the side of the river. Carlos tells Justine that the natives believe black jaguars possess evil spirits and are bad omens. They reach the clearing site where they begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the land clearing. A private militia arrives, and when Justine is nearly killed by an officer, the protest goes viral on the internet. The group is arrested, but Carlos pays the police to release them. It is revealed that Justine's near execution was planned because of her father's influence and the attention it would bring to Alejandro's cause if she were killed. They depart by plane, but the plane's engine explodes and it crashes into the jungle, decapitating one of the pilots and killing several other people, including Carlos. As the survivors search for a GPS phone, Kara hears something near a bush but when she goes to see what it was, men painted in red emerge from the bush and kill Kara with arrows. The others are tranquilized by blowpipe darts and taken to a small village where they are imprisoned in a bamboo cage. The female elder ritualistically cuts out Jonah's eyes and tongue, and he is then dismembered and decapitated by the tribal leader, with his remains prepared, cooked, and eaten by the tribe. Amy has a sudden bout of diarrhea and is forced to use the corner of their cage, as the tribe's children watch and mock her. Alejandro reveals‚Äîto the group's dismay‚Äîthat the protest was staged to benefit a rival petrochemical company, with Alejandro knowing the protest was pointless but receiving kickbacks to allow him to focus on other activism projects. Justine, Samantha, and Amy are taken from the cage, and their genitals are probed with a sharp instrument. Justine is revealed to be a virgin and is taken away in preparation for a genital-mutilation ceremony. Samantha and Amy are returned to the cage. While Alejandro counsels the group to stay put and wait for rescue with the arrival of the next petro-company's clearing crews, the rest of the group attempt to escape. During a heavy downpour, the group distracts the watchman, and Samantha escapes and hides in a beached canoe. Justine is returned to the cage with her face and body partially painted. The prisoners are fed meat. Amy, who is vegan, reluctantly eats, then notices that a chunk of skin in the bowl bears one of Samantha's tattoos. Realizing they were fed Samantha, Amy slashes her own throat and dies. Lars stuffs marijuana down Amy's throat, hoping to get the tribe high when they cook her. His plan works and Justine and Daniel escape, but Alejandro stays, and not wishing to be left alone, tranquilizes Lars to prevent him leaving. As Lars regains consciousness the stoned tribe members, suffering from the munchies, eat him alive. Justine and Daniel reach the crash site and find a phone, but are recaptured and returned to the village. Justine is painted from head to toe and clad in tribal attire. Daniel is tied to a stake, and the male elder breaks Daniel's limbs, smears him in paste, and leaves him to be devoured by ants. News of arrival of the forest clearing crew sends the cannibals into battle fury, and the warriors stream into the jungle, allowing Justine to escape with the help of a sympathetic child. Daniel begs for Justine to kill him, but she refuses so the child does it, putting him to sleep before slitting his throat. Alejandro begs Justine for help, but she abandons him and flees. A single old man and child chase Justine, but they abandon pursuit when she crosses a river guarded by a black jaguar. Justine then encounters the militia fighting a one-sided battle against the tribal warriors. She convinces the original private security officer that she is an American, and the battle is halted and she is flown to safety. In a taped interview in New York, Justine tells her father and other government workers that she was the sole survivor of the plane crash, and the natives were friendly. Ostensibly to ensure the activists had not died in vain, she claims that the natives were innocents who had helped her before being slaughtered by the petro-company militia. Sometime later, Justine once more hears protests outside her window, and sees a group of activists wearing shirts emblazoned with Alejandro's face in the style of Che Guevara.

Roth wrote the script with Guillermo Amoedo. Production began in Autumn 2012 in Peru and Chile. In October 2012, it was announced that filming was set to begin in November in Peru. On October 25, Roth announced the full cast for the film. Principal photography began in October 2012 in New York City, and shooting in Peru and in some locations in Chile began on November 5, 2012. Roth said in an interview in February 2013 that he wanted the film to look like a Werner Herzog or Terrence Malick film. He has also said that he was inspired by such Italian cannibal films as Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox. Release On July 30, 2013, it was announced that The Green Inferno would premiere at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was intended to be released theatrically on September 5, 2014, by Open Road Films. However, financial difficulties with the production company Worldview Entertainment caused Open Road to pull it from its original release. The film had a secret screening on April 25, 2014, at the Stanley Film Festival. The Green Inferno was eventually theatrically released in the United States on September 25, 2015, by Blumhouse Productions' multi-platform arm BH Tilt and High Top Releasing. It was released in Filipino theaters on September 23, 2015 by Solar Pictures. Two versions of the film were presented there, depending on the cinema chain: an R-13 \\"sanitized\\" version with some gory details removed, resulting in five minutes of footage edited out, and the uncut R-18 version. Reception =Box office= The film opened to 1,540 venues, earning $3.5 million in its opening weekend, ranking ninth place in the domestic box office. At the end of its run, six weeks later on November 5, the film grossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.7 million overseas for a worldwide total of $12.9 million. =Critical reception= The Green Inferno received generally mixed reviews from critics; however, some praised the film's throwback vibe to earlier Italian cannibal horror films of the 1970s and its social commentary. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 39%, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 4.78/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Green Inferno may not win writer-director Eli Roth many new converts, but fans of his flair for gory spectacle should find it a suitably gruesome diversion.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". CinemaScore audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film received a glowing response from horror novelist Stephen King, who tweeted that the film is \\"like a glorious throwback to the drive-in movies of my youth: bloody, gripping, hard to watch, but you can't look away.\\" Todd Gilchrist of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, stating \\"Unfortunately, Roth‚Äôs abundant gore fails to either offend or exhilarate.\\" Meredith Borders of Birth. Movies. Death., reporting from Fantasia Fest, gave the film a more positive notice: \\"The Green Inferno never lets up: it barrels ahead, exuberant and relentless in its brutality, never giving the audience a second to unclench. It's a feast for gorehounds, one with an unsubtle message about the way that uninformed activism harms more than it helps. And it's a total blast.\\" =Controversy= The film was criticized by Survival International, which campaigns for indigenous peoples and indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation, as reinforcing colonialism and respectively neocolonialism, as well as their stigmas against indigenous peoples, portraying them as savage. Roth dismissed this argument as unimportant for stopping exploitation: \\"The idea that a fictional movie about a fictional tribe could somehow hurt indigenous people when gas companies are tearing these villages apart on a daily basis is simply absurd. These companies don't need an excuse‚Äîthey have one‚Äîthe natural resources in the ground. They can window dress things however they like, but nobody will destroy a village because they didn't like a character in a movie, they'll do it because they want to get rich by draining what's under the village. The fear that somehow a movie would give them ammunition to destroy a tribe all sounds like misdirected anger and frustration that the corporations are the ones controlling the fates of these uncontacted tribes.\\" =Home media= The Green Inferno was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 5, 2016, by Universal Home Entertainment. The release features a director's cut and an audio commentary by Roth, L√≥pez, Izzo, Burns, Blanton and Sabara. Cancelled sequel On September 7, 2013, it was announced that a sequel would be produced, titled Beyond the Green Inferno and directed by Nicol√°s L√≥pez. As of May 2016, there have been no further updates, other than articles referencing the original 2013 announcement and a single unsubstantiated comment, with no production details, that a sequel is still under consideration.

Since its inception in 1997, myNEWS.com has evolved from a single newsstand to the largest homegrown retail convenience store chain in Malaysia. Founded by Dang Tai Luk, its first flagship store opened on 25 December 1996. As of Year 2018, myNEWS.com has more than 430 outlets, the majority of them are located in the urban areas of Peninsular Malaysia. It is currently serving over 2.5 million customers monthly and has more than 1600 employees.  History  On 25 December 1996, the first newsstand outlet called MAGBIT in 1 Utama Shopping Centre was established by Dang Tai Luk and his wife Ling Chao. The evolution commenced in 1997 with the launch of the \\"myNEWS.com\\" brand name, riding on the \\".com\\" wave then, with the opening of the first myNEWS.com outlet in Mid Valley Megamall. Then, a company called Bison Stores Sdn Bhd was formed with plans to manage and expand myNEWS.com outlets across Malaysia. Bison started predominantly as a print media retailer and evolved to become a press and retail convenience outlet chain. Gradually progressing in the early stages, Bison Stores Sdn Bhd managed to open 10 outlets after three years in operation and achieved its 100th outlet opening in 2007, 200th outlet in 2014, and its 300th outlet in 2016. As the number of outlet grew, there was a shift in operations. Unlike the industry norm going through middle men in the form of distributors, Bison Stores went directly to many of the largest publishing houses in Malaysia to source for printed products. As parts of their service to publishers, a sales reporting system was customised to offer a better efficiency rate and provide timely market insights and movement of products. In 2012, the joint venture between myNEWS and WH Smith Travel Limited, a renowned convenience store operator specialised in travel accessories, to set up WH Smith Malaysia Sdn Bhd has testified the acceptance and recognition of the myNEWS.com name abroad. The licensing of the myNEWS.com brand name to two (2) outlets at the Yangon International Airport in Myanmar in May 2016 further affirmed the recognition bestowed on myNEWS. On 2 October 2017, Bison Stores Sdn Bhd changed its company's name to Mynews Retail Sdn Bhd. The new company's name allows them to incorporate \\"myNEWS.com\\" brand recognition into its business entities. myNEWS is today a recognised player in the convenience stores sector and is a renowned brand, both locally and abroad.  Parent company  As the largest homegrown press and retail convenience chain in Malaysia, myNEWS.com is one of the subsidiaries owned and operated by Bison Consolidated Berhad. On 26 March 2013, Bison Consolidated Berhad incorporated as Prempac Sdn Bhd, a private limited company. It changed its name to Bison Consolidated Sdn Bhd on 25 September 2014, and on 16 July 2015, it converted into a public company and assumed the name, Bison Consolidated Berhad. The company was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (\\"Bursa Malaysia\\") on 29 March 2016. The company also operates a bakery which supplies solely to myNEWS.com outlet and the information technology systems used by myNEWS.com are from its own development. Bison, during initial public offering (IPO), had envisioned to develop its own food preparation and packaging facility. On 5 October 2017, Bison Consolidated Berhad entered into two separate Joint Venture Agreements (JVA) for its food preparation and packaging facility in Rawang, Selangor to develop, produce and sell ready to eat (RTE) food and bakery products. The first JVA was signed between Mynews Food and Gourmet Kineya Co. Ltd and the second JVA was signed between Mynews Food and MRA Bakery Sdn Bhd. These joint ventures with partners, principally GK and Ryoyupan who are renowned experts in their respective fields has changed the magnitude and timeline for myNEWS to achieve its objective of offering great quality RTE food at affordable prices to the Malaysian consumers.

A right-handed batsman and right-arm bowler, Harrison made three appearances in first-class cricket, but played the majority of his cricket in minor counties cricket for Dorset from 1908 to 1946. Career Born at Blandford, Dorset and educated at Christ's Hospital and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Harrison made his debut in the Minor Counties Championship for Dorset against the Surrey Second XI. He appeared regularly for Dorset in minor counties cricket prior to the First World War, gaining the attention of first-class county Sussex, who he made two first-class appearances for in the 1913 County Championship against Somerset and Kent. Harrison was not reengaged by the county following that season, and following the First World War, he resumed playing for Dorset. He briefly returned to first-class cricket when in 1927 he was selected for the West of England cricket team to play the touring New Zealanders at the County Ground, Exeter. Harrison continued to play for Dorset up until the start of the Second World War in 1939, and following its conclusion he played six further matches for the county in the first season after the war, the last of which came against Buckinghamshire. This was his 166th appearance in minor counties cricket. He died at Clifton, Bristol on 2 June 1958. His brother Wilfrid also played for Dorset.

He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Denbigh Boroughs in 1572 and 1584. Life He was the second son of Sir Richard Gernon, alias Cavendish, by his wife Beatrice Gould, and was a native of Suffolk. He was for some time a member of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1568 and 1569 Cavendish was engaged in conveying to Mary, Queen of Scots letters and tokens to further her marriage with Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk; in 1569 the earls of Shrewsbury and Huntingdon in the latter year tried to capture Cavendish and prevent the circulation of his writings. He then appeared as a witness against the Duke of Norfolk at his trial on 16 January 1572, when the duke reproached him. To the parliament which met 8 May 1572 he was returned for Denbigh Boroughs, in opposition to the wishes of the Earl of Leicester. He was created M.A. of the university of Cambridge on 15 February 1573; the grace for his degree stated that he had studied for 28 years at Cambridge and Oxford. He was a second time returned for Denbigh to the parliament which assembled on 23 November 1585. In 1587 a conflict occurred, later taken to be of constitutional importance in relation to the royal prerogative. Cavendish had suggested to the Queen that it was in her power to create a new office for making out all writs of supersedeas in the Court of Common Pleas; and she granted the post to him for a number of years. The court resisted and obstructed the Queen; the lord chancellor reported the proceedings to the Queen, who avoided the potential collision between the prerogative and the law, by allowing the matter to drop. Cavendish may have died in 1601: in that year a monument to his memory \\"promised and made by Margaret, countess of Cumberland\\", was erected to his memory in the south aisle of Hornsey Church, Middlesex. Works Cavendish was the author of: * A Translation of Euclid into English. * The Image of Natvre and Grace, conteyning the whole course and condition of Mans Estate. Written by Richard Caundishe, London, John Day, n.d. and 1574, dedicated to \\"those who, through simplicitie of conscience and lacke of true knowledge, embrace the doctrine of the papistes\\". A poem in the Paradyse of Dayntie Devises has been ascribed to Thomas Cavendish the circumnavigator, his nephew, as well as to Richard Cavendish.

As the temple of Arad was already destroyed by the 6th century BCE, and as the ostraca refer to the place from where it was sent, after the period of Josiah's religious reforms and the concentration of worship in Jerusalem, the temple referred to by the ostracon seems to be the one in Jerusalem, which if true would make the ostraca the only direct proof of the First Temple's existence thusfar uncovered by archeology.

Though it is thought to be based on Seinfeld, the clips are actually based on the final scene of Daniel Baxter's favorite film, Swingers, with Superman standing in for Trent and Batman standing in for Mike. In various superhero episodes of How it Should have Ended, altered or added scenes are shown from the superhero film, followed by the superheroes that appear in the movie interacting with Batman and Superman (both voiced by Daniel Baxter) in the Super Cafe; it also always appears at the end of each episode (except the HISHE videos for Spider- Man 3 and Spider-Man 2, which the Cafe was only shown at the near beginning). The Super Cafe segment is featured in every superhero film the series has covered so far. Superman and Batman also make a brief appearance in a cafe in the How Pulp Fiction Should Have Ended. The segment was also used in the Nostalgia Critic's review of Man of Steel. A companion segment called the \\"Villain Pub\\" which is modeled from Cheers and features many popular villains like Loki, the Joker, Voldemort and many more began with How Thor: The Dark World Should Have Ended. In those segments, Emperor Palpatine is the bartender, Bowser is the bouncer (bownser) and Thanos is the janitor. The Cheers Theme Song was rewritten as a theme. There are numerous running gags in the Super Cafe segments, the most notable being in which Batman always explains his various accomplishments and abilities or finds some kind of excuse to say his catchphrase \\"Because I'm Batman!\\", much to Superman's irritation. In the Suicide Squad HISHE, Batman discovers the Villain Pub and in the Villain Pub episode \\"Boss Battle\\", goes to confront the villains congregating there, nearly successfully, only to be tempted by Emperor Palpatine by his weakness ‚Äì the ladies. It is then that Harley Quinn, who had used her vexing charms to be allowed back into the pub, knocks out Batman from behind. Batman is then taken into the cellar to be fed to the shark Jaws, who is comically depicted as talking in a high-pitched voice, chained up and stripped of his equipment. He barely escapes after being rescued by Dr. Strange, a fact that is reiterated in the Doctor Strange HISHE (which also cryptically contained a spoiler for the Avengers: Infinity War trailer). Later, in the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 HISHE, things begin to take a turn for the dire when Ayesha, disgusted by heroes congregating in a cafe to meet, decides to punish superheroes whom she blames for her failure by destroying their cafe and unleashes her superweapon Martha (a parody of Adam from the actual end-credits scene of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and choosing the name to taunt both Batman and Superman for their mothers having the same name). The arrival of Martha to decimate the cafe is foreshadowed in further videos like the Wonder Woman and Spider-Man: Homecoming HISHE videos. At last, in the Justice League HISHE video, Martha (voiced by James Rallison) arrives and succeeds in his primary objective of destroying the cafe but upon facing the Justice League, joined by Green Lantern, who comically resembles Steve Trevor, gets his neck snapped by Superman, much to the irritation of Batman, who had wanted to take down Martha through his own plan. The cafe is later rebuilt by Black Panther in the Black Panther HISHE video. In the HISHE video for Deadpool, Deadpool gets himself bounced from both the Super Cafe and the Villain Pub. He gets bounced from the Super Cafe because he likes killing enemies like a villain, and from the Villain Pub because he is not evil enough to be allowed there. Deadpool can't even swear at the Pub, with his attempts being given bleep censors. = Super Cafe episodes = { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#240; text-align:center;\\"Number !! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#001; text-align:center;\\"Title !! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#100; text-align:center;\\"Original Upload Date } = Villain Pub episodes = Note: Each episode features patrons The Joker, Loki, Lord Voldemort & bartender Palpatine. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#240; text- align:center;\\"Number !! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#001; text- align:center;\\"Title !! style=\\"background:#F0DC82; color:#100; text- align:center;\\"Original Upload Date }  References   External links  * *HISHEdotcom on YouTube *Video of the Streamy Awards presentation for Best Animated Web Series *Writer of Pop: Website of the week: How it Should Have Ended Category:Parodies Category:Streamy Award-winning channels, series or shows Category:2005 web series debuts Category:Crossover animation Category:Crossover television Category:American comedy web series Category:YouTube channels launched in 2005 Category:2000s YouTube series Category:2010s YouTube series Category:2020s YouTube series ","title":"How It Should Have Ended"},{"id":"40009275","text":"Cyclophora couturieri is a moth in the family Geometridae.

After studying art in Paris for three years at Acad√©mie Julian, he returned to the United States, becoming one of the first members of the Old Lyme Art Colony in Connecticut. His paintings, usually landscapes depicting the local scenery and often executed en plein air, were generally Barbizon and Tonalist, sometimes incorporating elements of Impressionism. He was especially known and respected for his paintings of trees. After eight summers at Old Lyme, he died there at the age of 41. Early life and education Back Street in France Allen Butler Talcott was born on April 8, 1867, in Hartford, Connecticut, into an established and prominent New England family. His artistic inclinations were apparent at an early age, as he created sketches of teachers and fellow students in the margins of his grade school books. He attended Trinity College in Hartford, receiving a diploma in 1890. His formal art education began at the Hartford Art Society, where he studied with painter Dwight William Tryon. He moved to Manhattan while he studied for a short time at the Art Students League of New York. Then he attended Acad√©mie Julian in Paris for three years, studying under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. His work received its first artistic recognition during this period in France, as his paintings were exhibited at the 1893 and 1894 Paris Salons. Work Lyme Meadow Talcott lived in Arles in 1897, renting Vincent van Gogh's house, along with Frank DuMond. He came home to Hartford, where he set up a studio, which he maintained for a few years. He also returned to New York, joining a cooperative studio complex which had been established by Henry Ward Ranger. Ranger became friends with Talcott, as well as an influence. Ranger was also founder of the Old Lyme Art Colony in Connecticut, and Talcott became one of the first artists to join. When he first arrived in 1901, he stayed at Florence Griswold's boarding house, which would later be turned into an art museum. He worked in his New York City studio during the winters, and spent his summers at Old Lyme for eight years, until his death there in 1908. Barbizon art was popular with artists in the U.S. during this period. Among Ranger and other Old Lyme artists, a variant, Tonalism, evolved in which the palette consisted of just a few muted colors. Talcott had gained a fondness for French Impressionism and was exposed to its American equivalent at Cos Cob, Connecticut, in the late 1890s. There, artists such as Childe Hassam and John Henry Twachtman were developing the artistic style. But Ranger and Tryon were stronger influences on Talcott, and his early paintings are primarily Barbizon and Tonalist ‚Äì landscapes in shades of brown, green and gold. Return of the Redwing Talcott bought an Old Lyme estate looking out upon the Connecticut River in 1903. Around this time, Hassam was bringing Impressionism to the colony, and many of the artists including Talcott began moving in that direction. He did not, however, fully adopt the principles of Impressionism, instead integrating certain aspects into his Tonalist paintings. He retained the Tonalist interest in a unified set of colors, while incorporating the Impressionist concentration on the effects of light by lightening his palette. While lighter than Ranger's, Talcott's colors were still subdued compared to those of the Impressionists. The nature of his brushstrokes also changed, becoming more \\"flickery\\". In addition to Hassam, DuMond also influenced him artistically. The Great Oak Although he created some portraits, for example, of family members, his subject matter consisted primarily of landscapes, often depicting scenes in and around Old Lyme and along the Connecticut River. He was particularly fond of painting trees, and was known and respected for those paintings. Charles Vezin, another artist in the colony, said of Talcott: \\"He loved and keenly appreciated nature, and his knowledge of all its phases was unusual.... His fellows conceded that no one was his peer in the knowledge of trees and how to paint them.\\" Talcott liked to work en plein air, creating oil sketches which he painted on wood panels. These sketches were often of high enough quality that they could be regarded as finished paintings, and were \\"admired for their sense of immediacy and rich textures.\\" Talcott died at his Old Lyme summer home on June 1, 1908, of a heart attack; he was 41 years old. In a review of a 1991 show of Talcott's work at the Mattatuck Museum, The New York Times critic said that Talcott was \\"more talented than many of his contemporaries who went on to Impressionist fame\\". Family River Island In 1905, Allen married Katherine Nash Agnew, daughter of New York physician Cornelius Rea Agnew, and they had a son, Agnew. Talcott's uncles, John Butler Talcott and James Talcott who together had established the American Hosiery Company, were both patrons of his work and John was the founder, through a large endowment made in 1903, of the New Britain Museum of American Art that has several of Talcott's paintings in their collection. Allen Butler Talcott's nephew was also an artist, American sculptor, author, and illustrator Dudley Talcott. Exhibitions and collections Talcott's landscapes were the subject of a single solo show during his lifetime, at Kraushaar Galleries in 1907; a review in The New York Times noted Talcott's ability to combine \\"an uncommon sense of the structure and underlying skeleton of a landscape with a feeling for color.\\" Talcott exhibited regularly at various venues including the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Society of American Artists, Wadsworth Atheneum, the Carnegie Institute, and the Old Lyme library, as well as other salons. Talcott was awarded a silver medal in 1904 at the St. Louis Exposition. He also won a medal at the Portland Exposition. As part of its eightieth anniversary celebration in 1983, the New Britain Museum of American Art featured an exhibition of Talcott landscapes. His work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Florence Griswold Museum, the Mattatuck Museum, the New Britain Museum of American Art, the Lyman Allyn Art Museum, and the Worcester Art Museum. Talcott was a member of the Salmagundi Club and the Lotos Club, and has work included in the collection of the latter.

Life Born 16 October 1798, was eldest son of John Morris of the Bombay civil service, who was subsequently a director of the East India Company. The son entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and saw active service during the last two years of the Napoleonic Wars. On the conclusion of the war in 1815 his father sent a note to his captain, George Sartorius: \\"Your trade is up for the next half-century. Send my son John home by the next coach\\". Morris went to the East India Company College at Haileybury, and entered the Madras civil service, reaching India in 1818; five younger brothers also obtained employment under the East India Company. Morris served for a time at Masulipatam (in 1821) and Coimbore. In 1823 paralysis deprived him of the use of his legs. Most of his time was then spent at Madras in the secretariat, or board of revenue. He was Telugu translator to the government from 1832, and in 1839, became civil auditor or accountant-general. He established in 1834 the Madras government bank, of which he was the first secretary and treasurer, and in 1835 superintendent. The bank was subsequently transferred by the government to private hands. While on furlough in England between 1829 and 1831 Morris was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He was an enthusiastic freemason, in Madras and in England. On leaving India in July 1846, he received a testimonial from the local population. Settling in Mansfield Street, Portland Place, London, in 1848, Morris spent much of his time thenceforth in commercial enterprises. He established a company to run steamers between Milford Haven and Australia by way of Panama, which lasted only a few years; and he promoted and was managing director of the London and Eastern Banking Company. In 1855 he resigned its management of the company to become chairman; but colleagues made speculations, and in 1858 the bank was wound up. Morris placed all his resources at the disposal of the official liquidator, and retired to Jersey, where he died on 2 August 1858. He was buried in Saint Helier. Works Morris studied Sanskrit, Persian, and Hindustani; but concentrated on Telugu. He compiled of the text-book Telugu Selections, with Translations and Grammatical Analyses: to which is added a Glossary of Revenue Terms used in the Northern Circars, Madras, 1823 (enlarged edition, Madras, 1855); and he was author of an English-Telugu Dictionary, based on Johnson's Dictionary, the first of its kind. It was issued at Madras in 1835. Morris was also for several years from 1834 editor of the Madras Journal of Literature and Science. Family Morris married Rosanna Curtis, second daughter of Peter Cherry of the East India Company's service, on 4 February 1823, and was father of John Morris (1826-1893), and other sons.

It has been designated a SSSI due to the importance of geology in this area.  Location  Corbet Wood is located west of the A49 between Shrewsbury and Wem. Grid reference SJ 525237.Shropshire Council \\"Corbet Wood Countryside Site\\" . Date retrieved: 19 July 2013 Corbet Wood is joint with Grinshill (a sandstone outcrop), this outcrop reaches a height of 192m.  Recreational activities  Walking routes are available, with most pathways rugged due to the steep slopes, so good footwear is needed. Recently a family friendly route has been designed on site. The Grinshill standstone ridge holds a good view showing South Shropshire and the Welsh Borders.  Wildlife  The mixed woodland of coniferous and broad leaf trees covering the quarried sandstone edges mean this site is host to a wide range of woodland birds. Species recorded include coal tits and goldcrests as well as some warblers and woodpeckers. In addition to birds, more than 120 species of butterflies and moths are present throughout the site. Natural England \\"Local Nature Reserve Corbet Wood and Grinshill\\" . Date retrieved: 19 July 2013 Situated at the top of the ridge, remains some relic heathland.  Background  This site was quarried for centuries, and is therefore a historic site of quarrying industry. Some geologists have found fossilized remains of a Triassic reptile making this site even more interesting to geologists. Go This Place \\"Corbet Wood\\" . Date retrieved: 15/8/13 Geologists have also found rain prints and different layers of rock formation in the exposed rock faces. Due to this geological importance it has been given two more designations; as a county wildlife site, and on 30 January 2006 a Local Nature Reserve.  Management plan information  At the end of 2010 the management plan was reviewed for this site. No major changes occurred and only dates needed to be changed.

It belongs to the LZ77 family of byte-oriented compression schemes. Features The algorithm gives a slightly worse compression ratio than the LZO algorithm ‚Äì which in turn is worse than algorithms like DEFLATE. However, compression speeds are similar to LZO and several times faster than DEFLATE, while decompression speeds can be significantly higher than LZO. Design LZ4 only uses a dictionary-matching stage (LZ77), and unlike other common compression algorithms does not combine it with an entropy coding stage (e.g. Huffman coding in DEFLATE). The LZ4 algorithm represents the data as a series of sequences. Each sequence begins with a one-byte token that is broken into two 4-bit fields. The first field represents the number of literal bytes that are to be copied to the output. The second field represents the number of bytes to copy from the already decoded output buffer (with 0 representing the minimum match length of 4 bytes). A value of 15 in either of the bitfields indicates that the length is larger and there is an extra byte of data that is to be added to the length. A value of 255 in these extra bytes indicates that yet another byte to be added. Hence arbitrary lengths are represented by a series of extra bytes containing the value 255. The string of literals comes after the token and any extra bytes needed to indicate string length. This is followed by an offset that indicates how far back in the output buffer to begin copying. The extra bytes (if any) of the match-length come at the end of the sequence. Compression can be carried out in a stream or in blocks. Higher compression ratios can be achieved by investing more effort in finding the best matches. This results in both a smaller output and faster decompression. Implementation The reference implementation in C by Yann Collet is licensed under a BSD license. There are ports and bindings in various languages like Java, C#, Python etc. Databases like Hadoop use this algorithm for fast compression. LZ4 was also implemented natively in the Linux kernel 3.11. The FreeBSD, Illumos, ZFS on Linux, and ZFS-OSX implementations of the ZFS filesystem support the LZ4 algorithm for on-the-fly compression. Linux supports LZ4 for SquashFS since 3.19-rc1. LZ4 is also implemented in newer Zstd archiver by Yann Collet.

Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \\"The Few\\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the Air Force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa, and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \\"be under white rule forever\\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \\"a form of political apartheid\\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time black majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa, being unwilling to accept majority rule in Rhodesia. He died in 2006 at the age of 90. Early life William John Harper was born on 22 July 1916 in Calcutta, British India, scion of an old and prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family that had been based in the subcontinent for generations, working with the East India Company during the 18th and 19th centuries. He was educated at North Point in Darjeeling, India, and in the English town of Windsor. He grew into a short but tough man who spoke with clipped diction. Nathan Shamuyarira wrote of him in 1966 that \\"his tight mouth rarely relaxes into a smile, so ... he seems always on the point of losing his temper\\". Second World War; Royal Air Force pilot A Hawker Hurricane of Harper's unit, No. 17 Squadron RAF, during the Battle of Britain Harper joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1937, and was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on 5 September. He was promoted to flying officer on 12 February 1940, and attached to No. 17 Squadron. On 18 May 1940 he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter, and a week later he destroyed a Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive bomber. He was appointed B Flight commander, with the rank of acting flight lieutenant, on 26 May. He destroyed another Bf 110 over Dunkirk three days later, during the evacuation of Allied forces, and continued as flight commander until 8 June 1940, reverting to the rank of flying officer. He was again promoted to acting flight lieutenant on 4 July, when he was given command of A Flight. From July 1940, still flying with No. 17 Squadron, Harper was one of \\"The Few\\", the Allied pilots of the Battle of Britain. On 11 August he shared in the probable destruction of a Bf 110 and damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. Four days later, after taking off as part of a group of six Hawker Hurricanes assigned to intercept more than 20 Luftwaffe aircraft, Harper contacted the German planes alone and probably destroyed a Bf 109 before being shot down. He crash-landed in a field near the Suffolk seaside town of Felixstowe, and convalesced in hospital there with wounds to his face and leg. He soon rejoined No. 17 Squadron and continued his command of A Flight from the ground‚Äîhe returned to the skies on 1 November 1940. A week later he destroyed a Ju 87 and probably another. Harper received the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant on 12 February 1941. A month later he was posted to No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF, based at RAF Hawarden in Wales, as an instructor. In September 1941, Harper was seconded to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to command No. 453 Squadron RAAF, which was based at Singapore and operated Brewster Buffalo fighters. After suffering heavy losses during the Malayan Campaign in December, No. 453 Squadron was temporarily amalgamated with another Buffalo unit, No. 21 Squadron RAAF, to form No. 21/453 Squadron under Harper's command. By February 1942, No. 453 Squadron was denuded of aircraft and its remaining personnel were evacuated to Australia. Harper assumed command of No. 135 Squadron RAF in India in April 1942. In January 1943 he took command of No. 92 (East India) Squadron RAF in North Africa, and was promoted to temporary squadron leader with seniority backdated to March 1942. He was transferred to England in September 1943 and commanded the University Air Squadron at Leeds until 1944. He remained with the RAF following the end of hostilities. Political career =Emigration to Rhodesia= The alt=A map. See description Harper was appalled when Britain made India independent in 1947‚Äîhe held that the British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered. =Dominion Party= Harper entered politics when he contested the Gatooma seat in the 1958 general election, running for the opposition Dominion Party (which called for full \\"dominion\\" or Commonwealth realm status). The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote‚Äîthe criteria were applied equally regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly drawn from the white minority (about 5% of the population). Harper won in Gatooma with 717 out of 1,300 votes. Holding strongly conservative views, he soon became seen as the voice of the party's right wing. He was elected president of the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian arm in October 1959, and by 1960 he was the official Leader of the Opposition in the Southern Rhodesian parliament. Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation was looking ever more tenuous and the idea of \\"no independence before majority rule\\" was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and \\"go it alone\\". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of \\"Southern Rhodesia first\\", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that \\"trouble pays dividends\\". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs \\"they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can the people of this country expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?\\" =Rhodesian Front= Ian Smith became Prime Minister in 1964. Harper was touted by pressmen as a possible replacement for the next four years. In 1962 Harper was a founding member of the Rhodesian Front (RF), an alliance of conservative voices centred around the former Dominion Party and defectors from the UFP. The party's declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without radical constitutional change and without any set timetable for the introduction of majority rule. After the RF won a surprise victory in the November 1962 general election‚ÄîHarper comfortably retained his seat in Gatooma, and elsewhere the country's first black MPs were elected‚Äîthe new Prime Minister Winston Field made him Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the new government. Over the next few years, Harper became one of the main agitators in the Cabinet for a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI); equating Southern Rhodesia to India, he saw this as a way to prevent a repeat of \\"the same mistake\\". The RF grew dissatisfied with Field during late 1963 and early 1964 because of his failure to win independence on Federal dissolution at the end of 1963. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, by contrast, were both independent under black majority governments within a year, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi. Harper, who had been assigned the additional portfolios of Transport and Power in November 1963, was one of two frontrunners to replace Field. The other was the Deputy Prime Minister Ian Smith, formerly of the UFP, who was also Minister of the Treasury. Harper, described in The Spectator as \\"an ambitious politician and single-minded upholder of white supremacy\\", was generally considered the more hardline choice, and the man more likely to go through with UDI. When the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964, it was Smith who was nominated by the ministers to become the new Prime Minister. Accepting the premiership, Smith reshuffled the Cabinet a few days later and moved Harper to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Harper was deeply disappointed not to have succeeded Field. As Minister of Internal Affairs, Harper oversaw the indaba (conference) of chiefs and headmen at Domboshawa in October 1964, at the end of which the tribal leaders unanimously announced their support for the government's line on independence. He continued to be linked with the premiership. During Smith's negotiations with the British government, each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in Rhodesia (\\"Southern\\" was dropped in late 1964) that Harper might step up to take his place. As the dispute with Britain intensified and white Rhodesians clamoured for independence, Harry Franklin reported in The Spectator in August 1965 that if Smith proved unwilling to go through with UDI, \\"it is widely believed that ... Harper will emerge from the wings, no longer an understudy, to dare what Mr Smith dare not.\\" Harper was one of four ministers chosen by Smith to accompany him to London for talks in October 1965, the others being John Wrathall (Finance), Desmond Lardner-Burke (Justice) and the Deputy Minister of Information P K van der Byl. Agreement was not reached and a month later, on 11 November 1965, Smith and his Cabinet declared Rhodesia independent. At the time of UDI, Harper reportedly kept a map of southern Africa on the wall of his office, on which he had coloured South Africa, South-West Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique south of the Zambezi and Angola red; he told visitors that \\"the red area will be under white rule forever.\\" While insisting that Rhodesia would continue regardless of international opinion, he publicly demonised the UK government, describing it in January 1966 as \\"an enemy ... [that] must be brought down\\". He also vilified black nationalist guerrilla fighters opposed to the Rhodesian government, calling them \\"gangs of terrorists\\" and \\"criminals\\". Comments such as these helped to cement Harper's reputation as a hardline right-winger and rival to Smith's leadership. The strong personalities of Harper and other ministers such as the Duke of Montrose (generally known in Rhodesia by his former title Lord Graham) were perceived by the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his compatriots as a great influence on Smith's political decision- making, an opinion also expressed by Harper himself. The Duke of Montrose (Lord Graham), one of Harper's main allies in Cabinet Although Harper was considered an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters‚Äîa 1965 report in The Economist called him \\"by far the best brain\\" in the Rhodesian Cabinet‚Äîhis views were often perceived as overly reactionary. He led a phalanx of far-right voices within the RF calling for \\"a form of political apartheid\\" in Rhodesia, and while the party line was gradual advancement of black political representation, Harper called not only for the cessation of such moves, but for the abolition of black MPs altogether. He thus became something of an obstacle to an Anglo-Rhodesian settlement. Indeed, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with Wilson in October 1966, it was Harper who led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to its ultimate rejection. Harper considered himself to have been overlooked when Smith gave the office of Deputy Prime Minister (which had been vacant since UDI) to the more moderate Wrathall the month before the Tiger conference. The South African newspaper Die Beeld reported in December 1966 that the RF's right wing was poised to oust Smith in favour of Harper, but this did not occur. =Resignation= On 4 July 1968, Harper resigned from the Cabinet at Smith's request. He was the first minister to be dismissed during Smith's premiership. The government released a statement explaining that Harper had been removed \\"for reasons entirely unrelated to differences of opinion over constitutional or other political issues\\", and saying simply that Harper had been deemed \\"a security risk\\". Harper publicly claimed that he had been fired for political reasons and because of the threat he posed to Smith's leadership. Smith was reticent but told reporters he was prepared to tell \\"the whole sorry tale\\" if Harper wished. According to the memoirs of Ken Flower, then the director of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall was the result of an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution. Harper officially resigned his parliament seat and left the Rhodesian Front on 11 July 1968. Wilson publicly welcomed his departure as a \\"step in the right direction\\", prompting a retort from Smith that he did not appoint or sack ministers to please the British government. Smith said that Harper had been depicted as more extreme than he really was, and denied that he had obstructed a settlement. In retrospect, Smith said he had been glad to be rid of Harper, who he considered underhand and devious. Harper ignored an approach from the ultra-right-wing Rhodesian National Party, offering the leadership, and for a time withdrew from public affairs. Montrose and the ministers Arthur Phillip Smith and Phillip van Heerden briefly threatened to follow Harper out of the government, but backed down within a few days. After a fresh dispute Montrose resigned on 11 September 1968 in protest against Smith's proposed constitutional and racial policies, which he deemed too liberal. A week later the RF's Albert Mells easily won the by-election to fill Harper's former seat in Gatooma. =Later career= By the time of the July 1974 general election, amid the Bush War, Harper had formed a small bloc of independents called the \\"Harper Group\\". In an attempt to co-ordinate opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the group made an election agreement with the Rhodesia Party (RP), which had been formed two years earlier; according to The Bulletin it was \\"seriously hampered by lack of established leadership\\" but nevertheless offered \\"the only real resistance [to the RF] in the polls\\". Shortly before election day, Harper told a meeting of 300 people that under the present system, which was geared to eventually bring parity between black and white Rhodesians, racial tension would increase and \\"the white man will be forced out of the country.\\" He said that while he was not prepared to let black Rhodesians take control of the government, he understood that some form of power-sharing between the races was imperative to the country's future. The RF won all 50 white roll seats, denying the RP any representation in parliament; Harper himself lost decisively in the southern Salisbury constituency of Hatfield. By the end of 1974, Harper had formed the United Conservative Party, which called for separate black and white legislatures. He subsequently reacted with revulsion each time Smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions. In December that year he described Smith's announcement of a ceasefire in the run-up to the Victoria Falls Conference as a \\"ghastly capitulation\\". In 1976, when Smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978, Harper accused the Prime Minister of \\"selling us out\\". \\"The mind boggles at the enormous impertinence and audacity of this man Smith,\\" he said. In December 1975, two months after the disappearance of the prominent lawyer and black nationalist leader Edson Sithole from the middle of Salisbury, along with his secretary Miriam Mhlanga, Harper stepped forward claiming that the Rhodesian state had kidnapped them. In what became known as the \\"Harper Memorandum\\", the ex-minister alleged that Special Branch had interrogated Sithole at Goromonzi prison and then shuttled him between holding points around the country. The Rhodesian government denied that it was holding Sithole, adding that he was not under any form of restriction. Sithole and Mhlanga were never seen again, and their fate has never been explained. In modern Zimbabwe it is generally accepted that they were abducted and killed by agents of the Rhodesian government. Emigration to South Africa and death Smith and non-militant nationalists agreed to what became the Internal Settlement in March 1978, and in January the following year whites backed the new majority rule constitution by 85% in a national referendum. Multiracial elections were held in April 1979 with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia afterwards. By this time Harper had already left the country; The Guardian reported shortly before the elections that he was \\"already settled in South Africa\\". Zimbabwe Rhodesia, with Bishop Abel Muzorewa as Prime Minister, failed to win international acceptance and following the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979, the UK oversaw a process leading to fresh elections in which the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe was elected Prime Minister. The UK granted independence to the country as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Harper died on 8 September 2006, at the age of 90.

History Groundbreaking at the airport took place on 17 July 2010. The airport became a sabotage target of the terrorist organization Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) long before the construction works began. Claiming that the airport will be used for military purposes, the PKK attacked three containers at the building site with firearms and threw a hand-made bomb from a passing-by car two weeks before the groundbreaking. Eleven trucks, a bulldozer and 17 telephone sets were set to fire. 25 workers were taken hostage. They were released after threatening. 70 workers quit their job and left the town due to threat notes distributed in the district. Eleven people, who transported material to the construction site, were kidnapped. Already two months before the completion of the airport, the PKK threatened the construction workers saying \\"We won't be responsible for anything, which can happen.\\" The attacks caused a delay of 250 days. The construction of the airport has started on 18 July 2010. It was opened to public/civil air traffic at 26 May 2015. During the inauguration ceremony attended by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and Prime minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu, it was announced that the airport is renamed Hakkari‚ÄìY√ºksekova Selahaddin Eyyubi Airport after Saladin (1137/1138‚Äì1193), a Muslim leader of Kurdish origin, who fought against Crusaders and captured Jerusalem.

A rugby union hooker, Bligh represented Buller and West Coast at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1910 whilst playing his provincial rugby for the West Coast and club rugby for the Blackball Rugby Club. Bligh played all three fixtures for West Coast in 1909, (including the fixture against Buller) was also selected in 1909 from the West Coast for the South Island representative team alongside fellow West Coast representative Walter Sotheran, that beat the North Island side by 19‚Äì11 at Athletic Park in Wellington. Working in the mine at Blackball, near Greymouth, Bligh was likely instrumental in the formation of the Blackball Club in 1910. He was team captain and nominated by the West Coast Rugby Union for selection for the New Zealand to tour Australia that year. Sam Bligh's selection in the 1910 New Zealand team was well publicised in Greymouth newspapers yet, for over 100 years, rugby records had credited Bligh as being affiliated to the Buller Rugby Union at time of selection. This error was only discovered in 2013. He played five matches for the All Blacks but did not play any internationals. He switched to rugby league in 1915 and played for Blackball. He used a pseudonym when playing rugby, because his family held strong temperance beliefs and disapproved of the game.

Popularly known as \\"La Chata\\", a member of the Royal Academy, Jos√© Maria de Cossio, called it \\"one of the most excellent bullrings of Spain\\". History =The first bullfights: La plaza del Altozano (Hill-top)= The city of Albacete has a tradition of bullfighting that goes back centuries. According to the minutes of the city council of 29 May 1564 bullfights were to be held in the plaza del Altozan (downtown at the time) on 24 June in honour of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the town. The first bullring built in Albacete, dating from the late eighteenth century, was located on the promenade of the Fairground paseo de la Feria) and was popularly known as the \\"Caul√≠n\\" in memory of the main sponsor. =The second bullring (nineteenth century)= The second Albacete bullring was built to accommodate the growing interest and expanding population of the town. It was inaugurated on 9 September 1829 by Juan Jim√©nez ‚ÄúEl Morenillo‚Äù y Manuel Lucas Blanco. The bulls were provided by Fernando Freire y Gil Flore. The leading torero of the time. The building was circular, measuring 34 meters in diameter and comprising two floors. While the first was intended for standing spectators with a few rows of seats, the second was for reserved areas and boxes. The materials used in its construction were stone, earth and brick. In a time when Albacete had a population just over 17,000, the bullring was designed to accommodate 7400 people. It had four doors for public use leading to 10 stairways to the stands. Beneath were three horse stables, two holding-pens with adjacent yards, an infirmary with three beds, three meeting-rooms and administration spaces, one of which was used as a chapel for the competitors. It also had units around the outside that were rented. In 1916, the then mayor, Francisco Fontecha, proposed building a new plaza because of the advanced state of deterioration. Despite repairs and minor modifications it was finally demolished in that year to build the current facility =The current bullring= On 20 September 1916 a meeting was held at City Hall to discuss the matter, and finally the construction of a new bullring was agreed, partly for security and partly to attract visitors to the town. The positive response of many attending the meeting the proposal was immediately accepted by general acclamation. The subscriptions subsequently raised 338,250 pesetas despite the difficult economic situation of the time. For the building of the arena a corporation called Taurine Albacete was created, and architect Julio Carrilero appointed. Construction began on 17 February 1916 and concluded in record time, on 9 September 1917. For the opening spectacle, the bulls were furnished by Don Fernando Villalon In 1918, the stands were refurbished with Novelda stone, which currently still exists. In 1921, they changed the roofing and in the late 1980s expanded the capacity, which the currently can accommodate 12,000 people.

He continued to work under the tutelage of Dasari Narayana Rao as an assistant director, associate director and co- director till the year 1980 when he turned director. =Director of comedy films= Narasimha Rao made his directorial debut in 1980 with the Telugu film Chandamama. It was a family drama. But the release of the film was delayedComedy is his forte, The Hindu. and was not screened until the year 1982. His second, third and fourth films, Nenu Maa Avida, Evandoi Sreemathigaru, and Illantha Sandadi, were all successful comedies and he earned a reputation for directing low-budget clean comedies. The films also incidentally started a successful collaboration with the actor Chandra Mohan with whom he went on to direct a total of 18 films. He has also worked with icons like Akkineni Nageswara Rao (Dagudumuthala Dampathyam, 1990), Sobhan Babu (Samsaaram,1988), and Krishnam Raju (Yama Dharma Raju, 1990). =Entry into Kannada and Tamil cinema= Two of Narasimha Rao's biggest hit comedies were the Telugu films Iddaru Pellala Muddula Police and Edurinti Mogudu Pakkinti Pellam, both from 1991. These hits paved the way for his foray into Kannada and Tamil cinema. Over the next five years, Narasimha Rao directed seven films in Kannada. He was invited to remake the two Telugu hits into Kannada in 1992. Iddaru Pellala Muddula Police was remade as Ibbaru Hendira Muddina Police and Edurinti Mogudu Pakkinti Pellam was remade as Edurmaneli Ganda Pakkadmaneli Hendthi. Both the films starred Kannada actor Shashi Kumar and both were runaway hits in Kannada. He went on to direct two more Kannada movies - Hendthi Helidare Kelabeku and Enondre. His another Kannada film, Geluvina Saradara (which had few comedy sequences taken from director's own Telugu movie Ketu Duplicatu) starred legendary Kannada actor Rajkumar‚Äôs second son Raghavendra Rajkumar. The success of this comedy movie paved way for his collaboration with the Rajkumar sons for two more films - one with elder son Shivrajkumar titled Raja and another titled Ibbara Naduve Muddina Aata incidentally starred both Shivrajkumar and his brother Raghavendra Rajkumar and till date remains the only movie in which the two brothers were seen on- screen. Narasimha Rao directed one Tamil film, Rendu Pondatti Kaavalkaaran, in 1992, which was a remake of his own Telugu movie Iddaru Pellala Muddula Police with the actor Nagesh's son Anand Babu in the lead role. =Successful collaboration= Narasimha Rao teamed up with the comedy actor Rajendra Prasad for 32 films, including hits like Gundammagari Krishnulu, Dabbevariki Chedu, Chinnodu Peddodu, Mama Alludu, Iddaru Pellala Muddula Police and Edurinti Mogudu Pakkinti Pellam. =Current Works= He is currently busy with the post-production of his 75th film Eluka Majaka starring Brahmanandam, Vennela Kishore and Pavani. The story revolves around a mouse, played by Brahmanandam, who wreaks havoc in the life of a young man.The Mouse Game, The Hindu. Other works and achievements He was awarded the Nandi Award for Best ScreenwriterNandi Awards List (pp 15), Nandi Awards pdf file. along with writer Adi Vishnu for the film Sundari Subbarao. The film starred Chandra Mohan and Vijayashanti. It was produced by Ramoji Rao under the banner of Ushakiran Movies. Incidentally, it was the second movie for the banner. He was also adjudged Best Low Budget Director in the year 1991 by the Delhi Telugu Academy.Delhi Telugu Academy Award Winners 1991, Delhi Telugu Academy. He acted as the Asian Panorama Jury Member for the 15th International Children's Film Festival by CFSI in 2007.Child jury to feature at Hyderabad Film Festival, The Indian Express. He was also a Jury ChairmanNandi TV awards for ‚ÄòAsha‚Äô, ‚ÄòPadalani Vundi‚Äô, The Hindu. for the Nandi Television Awards for the years 2005-2006. He directed a few TV series in Telugu including Bujji Bujjibabu for ETV in 2008. Personal life Narasimha Rao is married to Sailakshmi and has two sons, Kiran Relangi and Satish Relangi.

Pamelaria has sprawling legs, a long neck, and a pointed skull with nostrils positioned at the very tip of the snout. Among early archosauromorphs, Pamelaria is most similar to Prolacerta from the Early Triassic of South Africa and Antarctica. Both have been placed in the family Prolacertidae. Pamelaria, Prolacerta, and various other Permo-Triassic reptiles such as Protorosaurus and Tanystropheus have often been placed in a group of archosauromorphs called Protorosauria (alternatively called Prolacertiformes), which was regarded as one of the most basal group of archosauromorphs. However, more recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that Pamelaria and Prolacerta are more closely related to Archosauriformes than are Protorosaurus, Tanystropheus, and other protorosaurs, making Protorosauria a polyphyletic grouping. A 2015 analysis by Nesbitt et al. found that Pamelaria was the basalmost member of a newly formulated archosauromorph group also containing the Trilophosauridae and the newly redescribed genus Azendohsaurus, which had previously been mistaken for a sauropodomorph dinosaur. This new group was called the Allokotosauria. Later studies generally agreed with Nesbitt et al.'s findings, but some additionally postulated that Pamelaria was more closely related to Azendohsaurus than to trilophosaurids. Description Based on known specimens, Pamelaria reached a length of about 2 m. The neck, made up of six thick and elongated cervical vertebrae, comprises much of this length. The limbs are robust, roughly equal in size, and sprawl outward from the body. The pectoral girdle is large and plate-like. The tail is thick near its base and narrows closer to its tip. The skull of Pamelaria is small and pointed with small, conical teeth. The naris (the opening in the bone for the nasal passage) is a single hole positioned at the tip of the snout. The back margin of the skull viewed from above is strongly arched. The orbits or eye sockets are large. The upper temporal fenestrae at the top of the skull are small while the lower temporal fenestrae behind the orbits are quite large. Like those of protorosaurs, the skull of Pamelaria lacks a connection between the quadrate and the jugal bones along the bottom of the skull, meaning that each lower temporal fenestra is not fully enclosed by bone. The lower jaw has a large raised portion in front of the jaw joint called the coronoid process. Discovery and naming Fossils of Pamelaria have been found in the Middle Triassic Yerrapalli Formation in Andhra Pradesh, India. The known material represents six individuals from three fossil sites. The most well preserved is a mostly complete and articulated skeleton and is the holotype specimen of Pamelaria. A second partial skeleton belongs to a smaller individual. The other individuals are represented by isolated bones found in association with bones of the archosaur Yarasuchus, Pamelaria was named in 2003 in honor of vertebrate paleontologist Pamela Lamplugh Robinson. The species name dolichotrachela means \\"long neck\\" in Greek. Classification Pamelaria is a basal member of Archosauromorpha, the clade or evolutionary grouping that includes crocodilians, birds, and all reptiles more closely related to crocodilians and birds than to lizards (which form their own clade, Lepidosauromorpha). Among basal archosauromorphs, Pamelaria is most similar in appearance to Prolacerta from the Early Triassic of South Africa and Antarctica. When Pamelaria was named in 2003, both were placed in the family Prolacertidae. Pamelaria, Prolacerta, and other prolacertids were considered to belong to a diverse group of archosauromorphs called Protorosauria, which also includes the families Protorosauridae and Tanystropheidae. The features that are most often used to classify protorosaurs are long cervical vertebrae and a gap below the lower temporal fenestra of the skull, both of which are found in Pamelaria. Beginning in 1998, phylogenetic analyses showed that Prolacerta was not closely related to other protorosaurs; it was found to be in a more derived position than protorosaurs, closer the clade Archosauriformes. A 2009 analysis confirmed that this was also the case for Pamelaria. Both Pamelaria and Prolacerta were closely related to Archosauriformes while other protorosaurs formed a clade near the base of Archosauromorpha. The 2009 analysis also found that Prolacertidae was paraphyletic, with Prolacerta being more closely related to archosauriforms than is Pamelaria. This result suggests that features such as a long neck that were once regarded as evidence of a close relationship between Pamelaria and Prolacerta instead evolved independently in both taxa. Below is the cladogram from the 2009 analysis showing the relationships of Pamelaria and other archosauromorphs: Nesbitt et al. (2015) found Pamelaria to be the basalmost allokotosaurian. Paleobiology =Posture= The neck of Pamelaria was probably held above the rest of the body in life. At the base of the neck, the zygapophysial joints between successive vertebrae are angled to allow for dorsoventral or up-and-down movement of the neck. Closer to the skull the joints are angled in such a way that dorsoventral movement would be restricted but lateral or side-to-side movement would be possible. Therefore, Pamelaria would be able to raise and lower its neck from the base and turn its neck along the rest of its length. However, sideways movement would be limited because the cervical vertebrae are thick. The tail of Pamelaria is thick and heavy, possibly acting as a counterbalance to the long neck. The tail is tall near its base due to high neural arches above the vertebrae and long chevrons below them. Long sacral and caudal ribs restricted lateral movement, making most of the tail inflexible. The shape of the femur (upper leg bone) indicates that Pamelaria had large caudofemoralis muscles that further restricted the tail's movement (caudofemoralis muscles anchor to the base of the tail and insert into the femur). The equal length of the fore and hindlimbs suggests that Pamelaria was quadrupedal. The limb bones join loosely with the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Their shape indicates that they sprawled outward in life, giving Pamelaria a posture similar to that of lizards. Pamelaria would have rotated its limbs horizontally to move, pushing off from its outermost toe as do living lizards. To support its weight, Pamelaria may have used both its limbs and the base of its tail, possibly raising the rest of its tail while walking (a behavior also seen in some lizards) to reduce friction with the ground. =Diet= The small conical teeth that line the edges of the upper and lower jaws and the surface of the palate suggest that Pamelaria was insectivorous. Insect burrows are common in Yerrapalli Formation, suggesting that insects would have been an abundant food source.

A tractor configuration monoplane resembling the French Antoinette aircraft, its most remarkable feature was the arrangement of the rear control surfaces. It was exhibited at the Aero Exhibition at Olympia in London, in 1910. Design and development The Star Monoplane had an uncovered triangular section fuselage of wire-braced ash, with the wings attached to the upper longerons and the pilot seated behind the trailing edge of the wing. The fuselage divided into two sections aft of the cockpit for ease of transportation. The parallel-chord wings had rounded ends and wing warping control, the wires leading to a single king-post above the wing and to the ends of the undercarriage struts, which bore twin skids, carrying two wheels on a sprung axle. The tail surfaces consisted of a cruciform arrangement of four elongated triangular surfaces starting halfway down the fuselage, ending in raked ends bearing the outer pivots of the moving surfaces, each of which was an elongated diamond shape resembling a Malay kite. These could be used conventionally as rudders and elevators or alternatively operated as linked opposing pairs, so that their operation would cause the aircraft to roll to one side or the other. It was powered by a 30 hp (22 kW) Star engine driving a 6 ft 8 in (2 m) Clarke propeller.The Star Monoplane Flight 19 Feb 1910 Trials of this arrangement were not satisfactory and, during 1911, the aircraft was extensively modified. The lower fin and moving surface was removed and the remaining surfaces' controls altered to produce the conventional arrangement of rudder and elevators. The wings were reduced in span by 5 ft (1.5 m) and the tailwheel was replaced by a skid.The Star Monoplane Flight 1 July 1911 It was also fitted with a new Star engine.Dunstall ParkFlight 5 November 1910 Specifications (Final form)  References Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"Star Monoplane"},{"id":"40010079","text":"BiSS interface logo The open source BiSS interface (bidirectional/serial/synchronous) is based on a protocol which implements a real time interface.

Fluent in French, he installed gas piping into Paris and advised on the construction of the Suez Canal. Personal life Manby was born in Cowes on the Isle of Wight to Aaron and Juliana Manby, n√©e Fewster. Aaron Manby was a successful engineer building bridges, ships and engines. As a child Charles attended a Roman Catholic seminary; in 1814 he attended well disciplined Saint-Servan College near Rennes, but returned to England in 1815 having turned down the opportunity of joining the military under a commission organised by his uncle. Engineering career Manby's father was the founder, and from 1812, the managing partner of the Horseley Ironworks at Tipton, Staffordshire. In 1817, Charles began training as an engineer at the Ironworks working for such notable engineers as John Rennie and Thomas Telford. During his training he helped with projects at West India Docks and the iron paddleship which was named Aaron Manby. This was made in parts at the Ironworks and then transported to the Surrey Canal Dock on the River Thames in London. The ship was then reassembled with Charles Manby supervising the installation of the vessel's steam engine. Despite being only 18 years old, Manby was designated as the chief engineer during its maiden voyage on 10 June 1822 with Sir Charles Napier as captain. During this voyage across the English Channel, the vessel became the first iron ship to carry cargo from London to Paris. In 1823 Manby started work installing hydrogen gas pipes in Paris, employed by the French company Compagnie d'Carriage par de gaz Hydrogen; The company had been founded by Daniel Wilson and Manby's father the year before. Still employed in France by his father, Manby worked at a gas works at Ternes, then later reorganised the ironworks at Le Creusot. Manby's fluency in the French language was an asset throughout his life.R. B. Prosser, 'Manby, Charles (1804‚Äì1884)', rev. Mike Chrimes, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2007 accessed 19 Oct 2013 Manby was then employed by the French government creating France's state-owned tobacco factories. Charles then returned to the UK and took over the management of the Beaufort Iron Works in Beaufort, Blaenau Gwent where he married Ellen Jones in 1830. He briefly managed the Bristol Iron Works, but in 1834 he moved to London and began practising there as a civil engineer. He and Henry Cruger Price marketed the 'Price and Manby System' a new type of ventilation system for whole buildings. The business lasted until 1843 when their offices in Bristol and London closed. Manby had become involved with the Arctic explorer Sir John Ross's India Steamship Company which he joined in 1838.Ross, Sir John (1838) On communication to India, in large steam-ships, by the Cape of Good Hope : printed by order of the India Steam-ship Company, and addressed to the British public (London, Smith & Elder) ‚Äì see http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18643659?selectedversion=NBD4465283 The company's objective was to establish a steamship service to India, but it was quickly taken over by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Charles Manby then became Secretary of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in November 1839, succeeding Thomas Webster. He nominally retired from this role in 1856 and was awarded a testimonial, a prize and a purse of 2,000 pounds from the chairman Robert Stephenson. The next secretary was Manby's former assistant James Forrest. Manby remained involved in the organisation and participated in its activities as Honorary Secretary until his death. Manby helped Samuel Colt's company to create a factory in Pimlico to manufacture firearms. Colt had received a lot of interest in his revolvers at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and Manby had been involved in the organisation of the exhibition arranging financial underwriting for Sir Robert Peel. Manby negotiated a lease with the British Government which enabled Colt to go into full production three years later. Colt was able to make a profit during the Crimean War, but the factory closed in 1856 shortly after the end of the war. In 1853 Manby became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1856 he became the London representative of locomotive manufacturer Robert Stephenson and Company. Manby moved next door to Stephenson and travelled across Europe to represent the locomotive company using the contacts which he had created during his 17 years as secretary of the ICE. Charles Manby was chosen with James Rendel and John Robinson McClean to join the International Scientific Commission on the Suez Canal. This was based in Paris where his French language was again useful. His knowledge of engineering and his linguistic skills helped him serve as one of the secretaries to the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez, with Jules Barth√©lemy- Saint-Hilaire and Lieutenant Lieussou. In 1858, Manby, by now a childless widower, married Harriet Willard, the widow of publisher W. U. Hood. This second marriage also had no issue. He died on 31 July 1884, at Ranelagh House, 10 Lower Grosvenor Place, London. Legacy Charles Manby's house with blue plaque In 1860, Manby helped create the Engineer & Railway Volunteer Staff Corps (today, the British Territorial Army's Engineer and Logistic Staff Corps. As a result, Manby became a lieutenant-colonel. Manby left an estate of just under ¬£250. Today his home at 60 Westbourne Terrace in London is identified by a blue plaque. In addition to British honours he received acknowledgement being made Honorary Member for his work by the Institute of Civil Engineers in the Netherlands, an officer of the Legion of Honour and an Italian knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and with similar honours from Turkey, Brazil and Sweden.

Morton as a young man James Ferdinand Morton Jr. (October 18, 1870 ‚Äì October 7, 1941) was an anarchist writer and political activist of the 1900s through the 1920s especially on the topics of the single tax system, racism, and advocacy for women. After about 1920 he was more known as a Bah√° º√≠, a notable museum curator, an esperantist and a close friend of H. P. Lovecraft. Biography =Early years= Morton was born in Littleton, Massachusetts, lived in Andover, New Hampshire. His family reached back to the pilgrims landing in 1620, his grandfather was Rev. Samuel Francis Smith. A newspaper article from 1906 refers alittle to his youth - that he worked as a \\"newsboy, bootblack, an organ blower, and an employe(sic) in a jelly factory\\". In 1892 he earned Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University,Paterson NJ Morning Call of Oct 8, 1941 which was reprinted in simultaneously, in Classical Philology, earning a \\"Gorham Thomas\\" scholarship, graduated cum laude and was a member of the honors society Phi Beta Kappa. He was a classmate of W.E.B. Du Bois and carried on some correspondence with him. He gained skills in Greek, Latin and French. The Harvard Secretary's Report of 1896 noted by then he was in the temperate Independent Order of Good Templars, animal rights oriented New England Anti-Vivisection Society and had campaigned under the People's Party. Even at this early period he was actively involved in the amateur journalism movement, appearing in newspaper coverage of the developing practice in 1891, and elected President of the National Amateur Press Association (NAPA) in 1896. In his earlier days in New England he explored a number of alternatives to mainstream culture. =Anarchism and the tour to the West and back= He converted to anarchism, especially as individualist anarchism in the United States, anarchism and issues related to love and sex and freethought and went on a cross-country speaking tour 1899-1900 to the West supporting these ideas. Several of these talks appeared in newspapers. * * By 1901 he was active on the West Coast. When living in the West Morton wrote for or edited various anarchist journals such as Free Society,Morton is noted in many editions of Free Society - see Discontent, The Demonstrator, and Emma Goldman's Mother Earth as well as the Freethought periodical Truth Seeker and lived at the Home, Washington anarchist commune which had been raided though Morton was not arrested, and was still present when the news of the assassination attempt against US President William McKinley arrived. Morton's writings clarified that he favored a \\"non-retaliatory\\" anarchism. In 1904 he made his way back to the East coast* * and a talk of his on anarchist/free-thought and morality was carried in several newspapers. =Initiatives= As early as 1903 Morton was visibly against racism in his writing for the anarchist Distcontent. He campaigned actively for civil rights for blacks, challenged productions like Thomas Dixon's The Clansman, and in 1906 published The Curse of Race Prejudice, which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's The Crisis listed among its suggested reading materials in many editions over the years.  * * Morton served on various committees of the NAACP in the 1910s,* * and continued to speak on the issue across several years. * In 1922 he contributed to a conference on the history of racism. Perhaps no other subject consumed Morton's energy and focus in the earlier half of his life than the subject of a single-tax as originated by Henry George. It was one the topics he spoke across several years about. * * In 1916-17 Morton totaling 68 lectures in 54 cities, with over 2000 in attendance. Many of these made the newspapers.   * * He also advocated for taxing churches. * * A third topic was of lasting concern to Morton‚Äîthe facets of advocacy for women, including suffrage,* * feminism, and conventions on limitations on sexuality and contraception. In addition to particular topics that had his voice across the decades, and practicing law for some years in New York and Massachusetts, he wrote or gave talks on a wide range of topics: * racism against red-heads * then recent antisemitism in Russia * conventionality in religion and politics, * Thomas Paine * tyranny in the postal system (which was echoed in more than one newspaper,) work's rights and social reform * funerals in general and of Thaddeus B. Wakeman in particular * baseball games on Sunday * \\"Mob spirit\\" * contraception radicalism =Literature and friendships= In addition to various individual topics he was also invested in several over a long term. From about 1915 he was a prominent member of the Blue Pencil Club of Brooklyn, named after the traditional Blue pencil editor's corrections, and supported appreciation of literature in a number of talks. * * His close friendship with the author H. P. Lovecraft is today perhaps the feature of his biography which arouses the most interest. Morton promoted Lovecraft to be president of National Amateur Press Association in 1922. Association with Lovecraft Morton was a key member of the Kalem Club, the close circle of friends around Lovecraft in New York City in the mid 1920s. During the early part of that period he lived in Harlem, New York City, a predominantly black neighborhood. =Paterson Museum= Morton was an active student of mineralogy and a leading member of the Thomas Paine Natural History Association. In the mid 1920s he was offered and took the post of head museum curator at the new museum at Paterson, New Jersey ‚Äì then a regional locus of anarchism ‚Äì where he would build a mineralogy collection which was admired nationally and internationally. This job enabled him to marry the writer Pearl K. Merritt in 1934; the couple had no children. Morton became a leader in the American Association of Museums, and a leading member of the New York Mineralogical Club. Locally he enjoyed walking with the radical Paterson Rambling Club. In the 1934 he was interested in his family history and wrote congratulating a local historian on research important to overcoming some limits in his own research. An avid walker,* * he died in 1941, due to being struck in the back by a moving car while walking to a meeting . Religion Beginning in 1907 Morton also published a series of articles under \\"Fragments of a Mental Autobiography\\" in a journal named Libra which outlines his religious background beginning with Baptist family heritage, goes through Unitarian relatives, and Theosophy exploration, (he was president of the Boston Theosophical Society in 1895) and placing Jesus and the Buddha among those on the highest level of his admiration even if he found fault with all scripture and organized religion. In this period Morton was an avid \\"evangelist\\" atheist and often spoke out against religion* * but he had already encountered the Bah√° º√≠ Faith which: > At first, I regarded it with amused interest, as one of many little cults; > but gradually I found myself drawn into closer and closer relation with it. > There was a wideness in its attitude which I had not found elsewhere. It > held place for what was best in Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, > Buddhism, Freethought and all the rest, warring with none of these, but > finding each of them definitely serviceable to the larger spiritual plan of > the universe. It is the great reconciler and harmonizer. I have discovered > in it an abiding-place which I had sought in vain for many restless years. > It increases, rather than decreases, my eagerness to continue the > investigation of truth without bias, and to labor energetically in all > branches of human service. I have no fault to find with the differing > conclusions of other truth-lovers, and am ready to work with them all as > occasion offers. (near 1910) He became a convert to the religion in later life. Morton is visibly in Bah√° º√≠ circles from 1915 on the program of presenters at Green Acre, a Bah√° º√≠ center of lectures and conferences from about 1912, and got into some debates with a critic of the religion circa 1916.The debates followed the publication of - see He also served as an alternate delegate from New York to a national convention of the religion in 1918. He received two letters (aka \\"Tablets\\") from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, in 1919 which were later published in the Bah√° º√≠ journal Star of the West.* * Morton increasingly gave public talks related to the religion from the late 1910s through the 20s and into the 30s   * and during the same period addressed the topic of Esperanto sometimes as a Bah√° º√≠ specifically.* Letters to the Editor from 1911 and 1922 quoted in    * * He was vice-president of the Esperanto League for North America, and was the lead teacher of that language at the Ferrer Center (a long-running anarchist school) in New York City. =Similarities, parallels and connections= It is worth noting perhaps that other Bah√° º√≠s were interested in the single tax movement originated around the ideas of Henry George, and other ideas also in common with the young Morton. Among these were Paul Kingston Dealy and Marie Howland. Both had joined the religion some years earlier around 1897-8. Dealy and Howland had joined the religion in different cities - Chicago, the first national community of Baha'is in the US in the case of Dealy, and Howland in Enterpririse Kansas, the second such in the States. Dealy had also previously run for office under the People's Party circa 1895 but in Chicago. Howland and her husband had also been interested in the ideas of sexual freedom against the norms of the day and the cultural situation of women though Howland's husband soon died. Both Dealy (and his family) and Howland, independently, also moved to commune of sorts although this one was different, at Fairhope, Alabama, circa 1898-9. There Howland established the first library and worked on the first newspaper, another interest of Morton's, of the colony. Another Bah√° º√≠ couple - Honor√© Jaxon and Aim√©e Montfort show similar interests as well. Jaxon had been an anarchist a decade before and been involved in another commune of sorts at Topolobampo Mexico, and then joined the religion about 1897 in Chicago shortly before Aim√©e. They had married and pursued worker's rights involvements though their long term interested turned to Canada. It is not known if Morton, Dealy, Howland, Jaxon or Montfort ever knew of each other. Additionally Thornton Chase, called the first Bah√° º√≠ in the West, was a student of Morton's grandfather, Rev. Samuel Francis Smith, in his youth.

The YPG launched a campaign in an attempt to take control of the Islamist-controlled areas in the governorate of al-Hasakah and parts of Raqqa and Aleppo governorates after al-Qaeda in Syria used those areas to attack the YPG. The Kurdish groups and their allies' goal was also to capture Kurdish areas from the mainly Arab Islamist rebels, and strengthen the autonomy of the region of Rojava. The Syrian Democratic Forces would go on to take substantial territory from Islamist groups, in particular the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, provoking a strong reaction from Turkey, ruled by the Islamist Justice and Development Party. Background Since the end of the Battle of Ras al-Ayn, the city was divided between an Arab-controlled western part and a Kurdish- controlled eastern part. On 16 July, members of the al-Nusra Front attacked a Women's Protection Units (YPJ) patrol. They detained the driver; two female fighters managed to escape. In response to this attack, the People's Protection Units (YPG) brought reinforcements from al-Derbasiya while al-Nusra had sent 200 fighters as reinforcements a few days before. The conflict =2013= On 28 January, Arab tribesmen attacked the homes of Christian Armenians and Assyrians in the village of ad-Dalawiyah ( south of Qamishli) and attempted to steal their harvest. The Assyrian Democratic Organization condemned the attacks, characterising them as \\"foreign deeds\\". Islamist rebels repeatedly called for Christians in the province to leave. Kurdish capture of Ras al-Ayn and spread of fighting  On 16 July, the Kana'is street (where the YPG was positioned) and the al-Mahatta neighborhood (where al-Nusra was positioned) witnessed clashes. A few hours later, the YPG took control of the headquarters of al-Nusra and released the fighter al-Nusra had kidnapped. On 17 July, Kurdish fighters expelled the jihadists from the town of Ras al- Ayn after a night of fighting and soon after took control of the border crossing with Turkey.AFP, \\"Syrie: les Kurdes infligent une cuisante d√©faite aux jihadistes\\", L'Orient le Jour, 17 July 2013. Islamist forces retreated from Ras al-Ayn to Tal Half, Asfar and Najar which were under rebel control. Eleven people were killed during the fighting, including nine jihadist and two Kurdish fighters. On 19 July, the YPG captured the village of Tal A'lo. Fighting was still continuing in Karhouk and A'li Agha. The next day, Kurdish fighters captured an al-Nusra checkpoint near the contested villages. By this point, 35 jihadist and 19 YPG fighters had been killed in the fighting. On 20 July, the YPG took control of a key dam previously held by the Islamists. By the end of July 2013, ISIL and al-Nusra expelled Jabhat al-Akrad and the YPG from the border town of Tell Abyad after a week of fighting which displaced thousands of Kurdish civilians. August‚ÄìSeptember fighting and Kurdish advances On 1 August, the Islamic State declared the start of the siege of Koban√Æ, or Ayn al-Arab where the headquarters of the YPG is located. The area surrounding Kobani was then blocked on all sides by ISIL and the Turks. By August 28, Islamists and Kurdish forces were battling for control of the town of Yarubiya on the Iraq‚ÄìSyria border. Islamists had captured further territory from the Kurds in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces; while in Aleppo, Islamists were ethnically cleansing Kurds from towns in the countryside and massacring them, leading to a mass migration of civilians to the town of Afrin. On 17 September, in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, Fighting broke out between Kurdish fighters and Islamist fighters in A'louk village that lies east of Ras al-A'in while fighting still took place near the town of al-Ya'rubiya. On 18 September, YPG took control of A'louk after four days of fighting that killed 20 people. On 26 September, rebels from the Free Syrian Army joined ISIL in clashes with YPG forces around the town of Atma, on the Turkish border. FSA units were said to have brought heavy artillery to the battle to push back Kurdish snipers while Kurdish tanks were firing at Atma. Arab rebel artillery was launched at the town of Jindires. On 29 September, multiple bombers attacked Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Six people were killed and more than 40 were injured. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility and stated the attacks were retaliation for Masoud Barzani's stated intention of intervening in Syria on behalf of the Syrian Kurds. October Kurdish offensive On 26 October the YPG took control of the al-Yaarubiyah border crossing with Iraq as well as the town itself.\\"Kurdish Fighters Gain Control of Syria-Iraq Border Town\\", Rudaw.net On 28 October, the ISIS front in the oil-rich √áil Axa region completely collapsed.

November Kurdish offensive On 2 November, Kurdish forces launched an offensive called the \\"Serekeniye Martyrs' Offensive\\", with the aim of consolidating their control of Hasaka province by pushing jihadist forces out of the area surrounding Ras al-Ayn. On 6 November, in Hasakah province, the YPG took over two villages west of Tall Tamer, on the highway to Aleppo, after clashes with the Islamic State, Jabhat Al-Nusra and allied rebel groups. The towns the YPG had taken over were Ghebesh and Tal Shemarin, which are inhabited by Assyrians. By this point, YPG forces had captured a total of 40 towns and villages in the offensive. On 13 November, following major gains by the YPG, the PYD announced plans to create an autonomous transitional government to run the Kurdish-majority northeast of Syria. The plans were announced after a meeting in Qamishli that also involved Christian and Arab groups. The plan called for the creation of a parliament of 82 members elected from three cantons across the region. Kurdish officials also stated that the region would continue to be managed autonomously regardless of events elsewhere. In Raqqa province, rebel fighters launched domestically manufactured rockets on the villages of Kandar and Abdi Kawi which were under the control of the YPG. On 28 November, in Al-Hasakah province, YPG fighters took of three villages (Rokoba, A'wja, and Tal Maghas) which lie on the Tal Tamer-Hasaka road after violent clashes with the Islamic State, al-Nusra and several rebel battalions.

On 23 February, a predawn raid by the YPG captured Tell Brak, which lies in a strategic position between Al-Hasakah and Qamishli. On 26 February, the YPG announced it had halted all its military operations in the Kurdish-controlled regions but warned its enemies that it would respond to every hostile action on Kurdish soil.

On 22 March, SOHR reported heavy clashes between ISIL and the YPG around many villages in the western countryside of Tell Abyad, which resulted in the fleeing of mainly Kurdish refugees from the western countryside of Tell Abyad and surrounding areas to Turkey. On 1 April, ISIL laid siege to Koban√™ from three flanks, and launched an artillery attack from Zor Mughar. The YPG ambushed Islamic State forces at Kendal, east of Koban√™, killing 12 Azeri ISIL fighters and their Kurdish commander. Fighting raged in Zor Mughar and Kharab Atto while YPG fighters cut off all the roads leading to Koban√™ from the western side, starting from the villages of Ta'lk, Derbazin and al-Qanaya, to prevent potential attacks by Islamic State fighters against the city. Despite YPG control of the hills around Sirrin, ISIL forces, backed up by tanks, captured two grain silos and seized the village of Tal al-Bawgha. The YPG, the Euphrates Islamic Liberation Front, Liwa Ahrar Souriya and the Liwa Thuwwar al-Raqqa worked together against the Islamic State in Koban√™.

Binnie was the third generation of his family to enter civil engineering (his grandfather was Sir Alexander Binnie, and father William Binnie). He was educated at Charterhouse School, Trinity Hall, Cambridge and Zurich University. On graduation, he became a pupil of Swiss engineer Dr Henry Edward Gruner, working on a hydro-electric scheme, Seruf-Niederenbach, in the Alps, and then on a larger project, Albbruck-Dogern on the River Rhine. He joined the Binnie & Partners firm of consulting engineers in 1931. From 1932‚Äì1936, he worked on the 88m high Jubilee Dam in Hong Kong, the then highest dam in the British Empire. Upon his return to the UK, he worked on the construction of Eye Brook Reservoir at Corby, Northamptonshire. In 1939, he was appointed a Partner in the family firm. During World War II, he served in the Royal Engineers. After the war, he worked on various water supply projects in the UK and overseas, including the Kalatuwawa Dam, near Hanwella, which supplies water to Colombo in Sri Lanka. Other major projects included: *Dukan Dam, on River Tigris, Iraq *Mangla Dam, on the Jhelum River, Pakistan, today still the world's 16th largest dam. *the W. A. C.

It was created by economist and author Todd Buchholz, a former White House economic adviser and winner of the Allyn Young Teaching Prize at Harvard University. Unique characteristics Unlike a number line, which extends horizontally and infinitely, the Math Arrow displays the whole numbers from 0 to 100 in a pair of parallel zigzag lines. The numbers on the left hand zigzag run from 0 at the bottom to 50 at the top; on the right hand zigzag they run from 50 at the top to 100 at the bottom (the number 50 appears twice, at the top of both zigzags). The Math Arrow has a number of characteristics that allow users to detect patterns in the relationship of numbers. 1\\\\. Each pair of numbers on the same horizontal level sums to 100. 2\\\\. On the left half of the Math Arrow, each number is vertically above or below another number that sums to 50. 3\\\\. On the right half of the Math Arrow, each number is vertically above or below another number that sums to 150. 4\\\\. The zigzag pattern changes direction at each multiple of 5, except for 5, 45, 55 and 95. 5\\\\. Odd numbers are displayed in triangles, except for odd multiple of 5, which are displayed in pentagons. 6\\\\. Even numbers are displayed in squares, except for multiples of 10, which are displayed in circles. The tool is supported by an iPad app that is aimed at 3 to 13 year-olds. There are three difficulty levels to span those ages. Inventor The Math Arrow was invented by economist and author Todd Buchholz, a former White House economic adviser and winner of the Allyn Young Teaching Prize at Harvard University. Buchholz developed and patented the Math Arrow in conjunction with his daughters Victoria, Katherine and Alexia. The Math Arrow is used in games developed by the educational software company, Sproglit, LLC, of which Buchholz is a founder and serves as chief executive officer. In an article for the Huffington Post, Buchholz wrote: \\"Sometimes we need to fundamentally re- examine even the basic tools of the classroom. Take the number line, which hangs on the walls of kindergartens across the world. Why is it horizontal? Are we sure that this linear image is the most effective way to demonstrate relations among numbers? What if it had a different shape, for example, a zig- zag? Innovations in design can help develop math sense in our children and teach them in a way that engages and plays to their love of images.\\" Reception In 2013, a number of schools in San Diego and Utah began using Sproglit‚Äôs first game, Kyle Counts as an iPad App in beta form. The Math Arrow has been called \\"ingenious\\" by Martin Cooper, inventor of the cellular phone. It has also been praised by Caltech physicist Len Mlodinow, who co-wrote with Stephen Hawking, A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design. Commenting on the invention, The Guardian's Alex Bellos wrote: \\"The point behind Todd's reinvented number line is a valid and interesting one: that visual memory needs to be exploited far more than it currently is when we learn numbers. [...] Professional mathematicians will often tell you that the only way they can fully understand certain abstract concepts is by creating a visual image. So why not encourage children to do the same with numbers?\\" Education Today highlighted the fact that Math Arrow is not the only product of its kind on the market, but said \\"unlike other maths apps, it does not rely on drilling facts in a way that soon bores young children\\".

Among other central bodies of state administration there also were committees, state committees, and other agencies. After World War II in 1946 ministries uniformly as throughout the rest of the Soviet Union replaced the existing People's Commissariats. The ministries were part of the Council of Ministries of the UkrSSR until 18 April 1991 when the latter was reformed into the Cabinet of Ministries of the UkrSSR.Myronenko, O.

About list of ministers and other central bodies of state administration of the Ukrainian SSR. May 13, 1991. Supposedly republican ministries were administered by the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, while union- republican ministries had double subordination to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR as well as to their respective union-republican ministries of the Soviet Union or in some instances - state committees of the Soviet Union. The general principles of organization and functioning of ministries of the Ukrainian SSR are regulated by the Constitution of the Soviet Union, Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, and other legal acts. More detailed regulations are established by the Law of the Ukrainian SSR about the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR of December 19, 1978. Additionally each ministry has its own statute that defines its tasks, powers, and legal status. Ministries of the Ukrainian SSR are headed by their ministers. Ministries are responsible for status and development of their respective sector and execution of state plans as well as solution of other tasks that those sectors face. In 1981 there were at least 28 union-republican ministries in Ukraine and only six republican ministries. After transformation of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR into the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, number of ministers decreased substantially, while their categorization on union-republican and republican was eliminated after the adaptation of Declaration on State Sovereignty of Ukraine.Law of the Ukrainian SSR.

Life 'Joe' Eggeling was born the son of a doctor in Upper Largo in Fife. When seven years old and enrolled at Kirkton of Largo Parish School, he was bed-ridden for 18 months with tuberculosis of the hip. Despite this initial set back he rose to a distinguished career. Following St Mary's Preparatory School in Melrose, where he was Vice-Captain, Dux and Victor Ludorum, his schooling was completed at Giggleswick in Yorkshire. At the University of Edinburgh he graduated with a BSc in Forestry, and was awarded the Younger Medal in Practical Forestry, and three class medals for Indian and Colonial forestry, and forest mycology. In 1930-31 he attended the Colonial Service Postgraduate Course in Forestry at the University of Oxford. Despite his educational focus on India, he joined the Uganda Forest Department in 1931, becoming Assistant Conservator. In the days preceding environmental sensitivity he arranged for the draining of a large papyrus swamp near Kampala in order to establish plantations of Eucalyptus for use as fuel. He regarded this as an opportunity to study the swamp vegetation and published the first of many works, \\"The Vegetation of Namanve Swamp, Uganda\\" in the Journal of Ecology in 1935. At that time the government of Uganda had been stable for 40 years, with an economy based largely on coffee and cotton. The forests were regarded as just another resource to exploit. Eggeling was a leading figure in the survey of the natural forests of Uganda, and his management plan for the Budongo Forest in Bunyoro was seen as a milestone in tropical forestry. He gathered his accumulated experience in a revised edition of \\"Forestry in Uganda\\", the manual for trainees at the Uganda Forest School - this was one of the pioneer textbooks in African forestry. By 1939 Eggeling had collected some 3800 specimens for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the British Museum (Natural History). The publication of his book The Indigenous Trees of Uganda in 1940 led to his being awarded a PhD from the University of Edinburgh. He supplied a large number of snake specimens to Charles Pitman, author of The Snakes of Uganda. During Gibson Guitar Corporation, in addition to his normal forestry duties, Eggeling managed the collecting of wild rubber by teams of workers spread throughout Uganda. In 1945 he succeeded Norman Brasnett as Head of the Ugandan Forest Department. Having placed forestry in Uganda on a sound footing by 1950, he was transferred to Tanganyika to do the same. The Forest Department had suffered from years of neglect and underfunding, and the Governor, Sir Edward Twining co-opted Eggeling to reorganise the Forest Department. He spent from 1950-54 doing so and gave the Forest Department an efficient staff structure and created a serviceable organisation. In 1954 Eggeling retired from the Colonial Forest Service and returned to the United Kingdom, where he wrote and lectured on East Africa, and became a member of the advisory council of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania. Returning to Scotland in 1955, he became the Conservation Officer for Scotland, helping to establish and assisting in the management of many of the National Nature Reserves, which later formed part of the Scottish Natural Heritage. In 1965, he produced the first checklist of plants for the island of R√πm. Drawing on his forestry training he developed a management plan for National Nature Reserves which was subsequently adopted throughout the UK. His management plan for R√πm became a prototype of its kind, and was published in the first volume of the Journal of Applied Ecology in 1964. His love and experience of ornithology and botany earned him respect among naturalists, and he became a popular figure in the voluntary conservation movement.Obituary - Commonwealth Forestry Review Eggeling helped to found the Scottish Wildlife Trust in 1964 and became vice-president. He was also a Member of Council of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Chairman of its Scottish Advisory Committee, and President of the Scottish Ornithologist Club between 1966‚Äì69. He had an enduring interest in birds, was an enthusiastic bird-ringer, studying their migration. In 1967 he became Vice- Chairman of the Nature Reserves Committee of Northern Ireland, and in 1968 succeeded Dr Berry as Director (Scotland) of the Nature Conservancy. On retiring in 1970 he was elected a member of the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and was created a CBE in 1972. After 19 years in Anstruther, where his wife's parents had retired, he and his wife moved to Dunkeld in 1973. He died in Perth. Botanical referencing The orchid genus Eggelingia commemorates his name. Family In 1939 he married Jessie Elizabeth Tothill (d.1988), daughter of Dr John Douglas Tothill (1888-1969), CMG, Director of Agriculture in the Sudan, who had filled a similar post in Uganda. Jessie accompanied her husband on most of his trips in Africa, and thereafter in the UK, raising a family of three daughters and two sons.

He showed unexceptional form in his early racing career but emerged as a top-class racehorse as a four-year-old in 1996, winning the Prince of Wales's Stakes and Sussex Stakes before becoming the first European-trained horse to win the Hong Kong Cup. He returned in 1997 to win the Lockinge Stakes, but died a month later at the age of five. In all, he won eight times and was placed on a further seven occasions in a career of twenty races. Background First Island was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze and three white socks bred by the Citadel Stud of Knocklong, County Limerick. He was sired by Dominion, a racehorse who competed on both sides of the Atlantic, finishing third in the 2000 Guineas in 1975 and winning the Bernard Baruch Handicap three years later. He sired several good horses over a wide range of distances including the sprinter Primo Dominie (Coventry Stakes), Embla (Cheveley Park Stakes) and the stayer Trainglot (Cesarewitch Handicap). First Island's dam was descended from the broodmare Lavendula, foaled in 1930, whose other descendants included Ambiorix, My Babu, Bob's Return and Irish River. As a yearling, First Island was consigned from the Corduff Stud to the Goffs sales in October where he was bought for IR¬£130,000 by John Ferguson Bloodstock. First Island then entered into the ownership of Moller Racing a racing organisation financed by a trust fund arranged in the will of Eric Moller, who died in 1988. The colt was sent to England to be trained by Geoff Wragg at his Abington Place stable in Newmarket. Like many of Wragg's horses, First Island usually competed in a sheepskin noseband. Racing career =1994-1995: early career= First Island made his debut in a maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 August 1994. Ridden by Michael Hills who became his regular jockey, he finished unplaced behind the future St Leger Stakes winner Classic Cliche. The colt was then off the course for nine months before reappearing at Goodwood Racecourse in May 1995. Starting a 33/1 outsider for a maiden over one mile he recorded his first success by two and a half lengths from Iktamal, a colt who went on to win the Haydock Sprint Cup. Six days later, First Island completed a quick double when he won the Gresley Stakes at York by three lengths. The colt failed to win in his remaining five starts as a three-year-old, and although showing useful form he appeared to be some way below top class. His best efforts came when finishing third in the Group Three Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot and when beaten a short head by Celestial Key when odds-on favourite for the Listed Marshall Stakes at Newmarket in October. =1996: four-year-old season= Spring In the early 1996, First Island's most important role appeared to be that of lead- horse and training companion to the Wragg stable's outstanding middle-distance performer Pentire. On his seasonal debut, however, he showed that he made good progress as he won the Listed Doncaster Mile Stakes by one and a half lengths from Wijara. His next two runs saw him beaten when moved up in class as he finished third to Luso in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and fifth behind Gabr in the Sandown Mile. Having won only once in his last eight races, First Island next contested a one-mile Listed handicap race at York on 15 May. Ridden by Ray Cochrane, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew clear of the opposition to win by two and a half lengths under top weight of 133 pounds. Summer In June, the colt was sent to Royal Ascot for the ten furlong Prince of Wales's Stakes, then a Group Two race open to horses of three years of age and older, for which Michael Stoute's improving four-year- old Pilsudski was made favourite. Hills restrained First Island in the early stages before moving forward early in the straight. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and won his first Group race by a length from Montjoy. The winning time of 2:02.76 was a new track record. On 31 July, First Island moved up to Group One class for the first time when he contested the Sussex Stakes over one mile at Goodwood and was made 5/1 second favourite behind the Queen Anne Stakes winner Charnwood Forest. Hills appeared short of racing room in the final quarter mile but managed to drive the colt though a narrow gap before catching Charnwood Forest in the closing stages to win by a length, with the previous year's top-rated two-year-old Alhaarth in third. First Island moved back up in distance when he appeared at York again in August and finished second to Halling in the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs. Autumn On 28 September, First Island took part in an exceptionally strong renewal of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes: his six opponents were Ashkalani (Prix du Moulin), Bosra Sham, Mark of Esteem, Bijou d'Inde (St James's Palace Stakes), Charnwood Forest and Soviet Line (Lockinge Stakes). He was never able to challenge for the lead but finished third, beaten one and a half lengths and four lengths by Mark of Esteem and Bosra Sham. On his final European start of the year he made little impression in the Champion Stakes in October, finishing fifth of the six runners behind Bosra Sham and Halling. In December First Island was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong for the ninth running of the Hong Kong Cup over 2000 metres. Although no European-trained horse had won the race, he started 9/5 favourite against eleven opponents, including runners from Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Japan and Singapore. First Island was not among the leaders, but made steady progress before challenging for the lead in the straight. He overtook the locally trained Benji 200 metres from the finish and won by three-quarters of a length from the Australian-trained six-year-old Seascay. On his retirement in 2008, Geoff Wragg remembered Teenoso as the best horse he had ever trained but said that First Island's victory in Hong Kong was \\"a very special day\\". =1997: five-year-old season= First Island began his 1997 season in the Sandown Mile in April. On this occasion he was made the 5/6 favourite and finished second, beaten a head by Wixim, a four-year-old to whom he was conceding six pounds. Three weeks later at Newbury, First Island started second favourite behind the French challenger Spinning World in the Group One Lockinge Stakes. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from the subsequent Sussex Stakes winner Ali- Royal, with Spinning World a further five lengths back in fourth. When preparing for Royal Ascot, First Island sustained a career-ending injury, described as a \\"spiral fracture to the right cannon bone\\" when training at Newmarket on 5 June. Following surgery intended to save him for a stud career, the horse contracted colic and was euthanised in mid-June. A memorial plaque for First Island was placed in the middle of the lawn at Abington Place. Wragg called him \\"a lovely horse to train and tried his heart out... a horse we all loved\\". Pedigree *First Island was inbred 4 x 4 to Abernant, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Location  Lyth Hill is located south of the large village of Bayston Hill, just south of the larger town of Shrewsbury, at .  Recreational activities  There are several walking paths, ranging from easy to difficult, with a specially designed route for families. Sky watching at Lyth Hill is common due to the low light pollution levels.  Wildlife  The site has a variety of habitats, including woodland, scrub, and grassland areas which are valuable to wildlife and act as a refuge area from the surrounding towns. The meadows have been managed by grazing a small herd of [Dexter] cattle.  History  In the past this was a site of ropemaking, with a windmill built in 1835 by John Carter being used to make the hemp and flax fibres employed in the trade. Around 1920, a subsequent owner of the mill, named Hayway, removed the machinery. In 1917, the poet and novelist Mary Webb moved to Spring Cottage, a small bungalow on Lyth Hill. While living there she wrote the novel The House in Dormer Forest (1920) and delighted in the Shropshire countryside, which she was to recall in later novels and poems. An archaeological survey of the countryside site in 2005 found former field boundaries and paths that are no longer used or seen as landscape features. One feature that was regarded as noteworthy was a disused quarry. In September 2011 a Shropshire sky watch team, who had set up their cameras to witness the re-entry of a research satellite, instead reported a strange phenomenon‚Äîa red beam of light flashing down at the ground, accompanied by a crackling electric sound. After further investigation, it was suggested that this may have been caused by a military helicopter with the ability to fire lasers at the ground.

It was passed into law on 8 October 2002 in the Parliament of New Zealand. The Act changed the existing law to enable Crown organisations - Crown entities, government departments, or government-related organisations - to be prosecuted for offences under the Building Act and the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. While Crown organisations were required to comply with both pieces of legislation since their enactment, it was not previously possible to prosecute those organisations for offences committed under either Act. The Act is designed \\"to protect society and the individual from harm or danger arising from actions of the Crown by ensuring that there are mechanisms to hold the Crown responsible and accountable for its actions [and to] meet the principle that the Crown should in general be subject to the law and the same legal processes as anyone else.\\" It is administered by the Ministry of Justice. Background The Act was created in response to a Commission of Inquiry into the Cave Creek disaster, headed by District Judge Graeme S. Noble. Cave Creek is a small stream in Paparoa National Park. A viewing platform was erected by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in April 1994, which looked out over a 30-metre chasm with a view of where the creek emerges from a cave system below. The commission discovered that the cantilevered platform had been constructed by well-intentioned but unqualified volunteers without on-site plans or formal building approval. The platform was highly unsafe, especially with large numbers of people on it. On 28 April 1995 the platform collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 14 people. Although DOC took responsibility for the accident, there were no prosecutions due to a loophole in New Zealand law that prevented government departments from being held liable in such a situation. In his report Judge Noble recommended that the Crown's exemptions from the Building Act and the Health and Safety in Employment Act should both be removed.

Name  Although his name was \\"ƒÄzƒìn Gushnasp\\", there are several corrupted versions of his name in several sources; Azhin Jushnas (al-Tabari and Ya'qubi); Azhin Koshasb (al-Tha'alibi); Ayin Goshasb (Shahnameh); Arikhsis (al-Mas'udi); Arhasis (Gardezi); Yazdan Jushnas (Dinavari); and Yazdan Bakhsh (Bal'ami).  Biography  Azen Gushnasp was a native of Khuzestan, and is also called \\"Khuzi\\" by al-Mas'udi and Gardezi. He belonged to the arteshtaran class. It seems that when the Sasanian military commander Bahram Chobin won a great victory over the Turks, Azen Gushnasp reportedly became jealous and accused the general of having kept the best part of the booty for himself and only sending a small part to Hormizd IV. According to other sources, however, it was the captive Turkic prince Birmudha or the courtiers that raised Hormizd's suspicion. Regardless, Bahram Chobin was later dismissed by Hormizd, which resulted in the latter starting a major rebellion.

Biography Born and raised in Switzerland, Thomas Hauert studied at the Rotterdam Dance Academy in the Netherlands. He moved to Brussels in 1991 to work in Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker‚Äôs company Rosas. He then collaborated with David Zambrano, Gonnie Heggen and Pierre Droulers. After the creation of the solo Hobokendans (1997), he founded his company ZOO with fellow dancers Mark Lorimer, Sarah Ludi, Mat Voorter and Samantha van Wissen. Their first performance, Cows in Space (1998), was awarded two prizes at the Rencontres chor√©graphiques internationales de Seine-Saint-Denis. The work of Hauert first developed from research on movement, with a particular interest in improvisation-based processes exploring the tension between freedom and constraint, individuals and the group, order and disorder, and form and formlessness. The relationship with music also plays a major part in his work. Since 1998, Hauert has created around 15 performances with his company ZOO. They were co-produced by European organizations such as Kaaitheater (Brussels), Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), Charleroi Danses, Centre Pompidou (Paris), Festival d'Automne √† Paris, Th√©√¢tre de la Ville (Paris), Montpellier Danse, La B√¢tie-Festival de Gen√®ve, Tanzquartier Wien (Vienna), Mercat de les Flors (Barcelona), Springdance (Utrecht) and PACT Zollverein (Essen). In addition to his work for ZOO, Hauert was commissioned to create pieces for external structures like P.A.R.T.S., the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, the Zurich Ballet, Toronto Dance Theatre and Candoco. He participated in improvisation events like Movement Research Fall Festival 2008 and regularly improvises with musicians including Michel Debrulle, Chris Corsano and Barry Guy. In 2012, he was invited by IRCAM in Paris to lead a project on the relationship between improvised dance and electronic musical composition in the context of the festival-academy ManiFeste. In 2010, the Belgian director Thierry De Mey created a film co- produced by European cultural television channel Arte, based on the ZOO‚Äôs work Accords. Hauert has developed a teaching method from his choreographic practice. As a teacher, he has an ongoing collaboration with the P.A.R.T.S. academy in Brussels and regularly gives workshops worldwide. In 2012‚Äì13, he was the Valeska-Gert-guest professor for dance and performance at the Institute for Theater Studies of the Free University of Berlin.

It portrays the story of U2 in their own words and pictures. Background U2 by U2 was inspired by The Beatles Anthology, a book released in October 2000 as part of The Beatles Anthology film project. The book took over two years to complete and features more than 1,500 photographs taken from U2's personal archives, depicting the evolution from their early days in Dublin in 1978, to achieving rock superstar status. More than 150 hours of interviews were conducted by journalist Neil McCormick with singer Bono, guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton, drummer Larry Mullen Jr., and manager Paul McGuinness. Content U2 by U2 is an oral history created by Neil McCormick with the band, an in depth look at U2 with more than 150 hours of interviews from the 1970s on. This large heavy book describes the band started by four teenagers in 1976, and is the first book by the entire band written in their own words. The focus of the book is their music, their relationships and the growth of the band throughout the years, and is told by the band members themselves and their manager, Paul McGuinness, each tell their own account of a specific event. It is organized chronologically, beginning with childhood stories that continue through the Vertigo tour. McCormick, edited the book with the band to compile hundreds of un-published photographs. =Summary= The book is divided into a prologue and twelve chapters. The prologue is structured in four sections, one on each member of the band, containing their views on what being in U2 means to the musicians. Bono talks about his personality, The Edge gives a review on electric guitars, Adam Clayton explains how he'd always wanted to be a rock star, and Larry Mullen Jr. expresses the fact that he had never been comfortable with celebrity or fame. Each one of the members also shares ideas about the others. The first chapter, 1960‚Äì75: Stories for Boys, follows their childhood stories with memories and photographs taken from their personal collections. The second chapter, 1976‚Äì78: Another Time Another Place, reconstructs the formation of the band and their initial equipment and gigs. The third chapter, 1978‚Äì80: Staring at the Sun, covers the punk period, when the band was influenced by emerging acts such as The Jam, The Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The fourth chapter, 1980‚Äì81: Into the Heart, deals with the recording sessions of the band first two studio albums, Boy and October, and the filming of their first music video, \\"Gloria\\", written and directed by Meiert Avis. The fifth chapter, 1982‚Äì83: Sing a New Song, talks about Bono's marriage to Ali Hewson, the release of U2's third studio album War and how \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" became an anthem for peace. Chapter six, 1984-85: In the Name of Love, is about the release of The Unforgettable Fire. The second half of the book opens with 1986‚Äì87: Luminous Times, which talks about the release of The Joshua Tree, the band's most popular and critically acclaimed album. Chapter eight, 1987‚Äì89: Outside Is America, talks about the cinematic album and documentary Rattle and Hum. The ninth chapter, 1990‚Äì93: Sliding Down the Surface of Things, is about a time when the band changed their sound. A lot of U2 fans did not like the changes they were making but they continued to tell the Faustian story in spite of it. Bono and The Edge composed music for A Clockwork Orange: 2004, produced at the Barbican Theatre in London by the Royal Shakespeare Company, but it received mostly negative reviews. U2 released Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour, and Zooropa and this, in part, spurned the desire to make changes to the way they made their music. Chapter ten, 1994‚Äì98: Some Days Are Better than Others, talks about the members of the band, especially Bono, dealing with the situation after coming back from tour, trying to find a routine life. Summer of 1994 is called by Bono as their [U2's] Summer of Love. In 1997, Pop was released. The eleventh chapter, 1998‚Äì01: The Last of the Rock Stars, follows the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind and the death of Bono's father on 21 August 2001, a day after the band was due to play their first concert at Slane Castle for their Elevation Tour. The final chapter, 2002‚Äì06: Until the End of the World, opens with the band playing at the Super Bowl XXXVI in January 2002 for the halftime show. U2 played three songs, \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"MLK\\", and \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" while the names of the victims from the September 11 attacks were projected onto a sheet behind the stage, and, at the conclusion of the last song, Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag printed into the lining. The experience was described by them as \\"terrifying\\". The book then deals with the releases of The Best of 1990‚Äì2000, which included two new songs from the Monaco sessions, \\"Electrical Storm\\" and \\"The Hands That Built America\\". The book concludes with anecdotes and circumstances taken from the recording sessions of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and the following Vertigo Tour. Publication U2 by U2 was first published by HarperCollins in London, England in 2005. It is a coffee table book, an oversized, visually oriented. The first international edition was released on 22 September 2006 by the same publishing company. A lottery on U2's official website and competitions on radio stations across Ireland determined the 250 winners of a signed copy of the book. The promotional event took place at the Eason & Son bookshop at 40 Lower O'Connell Street in Dublin on 24 September 2006. The book has been reprinted several times, and translated into French (translated by Philippe Paringaux and published by Au diable Vauvert in 2006 and 2008), Dutch (translated by Joost van der Meer and Asterisk* (Amsterdam), and published by Het Spectrum in 2006 and 2008), Danish (Danish title: U2 om U2; published by Ekstra Bladet in 2006), Finnish (translated by Veli-Pekka Saarinen and Elina Lustig, and published by Tammi in 2006), German (translated by Charlotte Lyne and published by Scherz in 2006), Italian (published by Rizzoli in 2006), Czech (Czech title: U2 o U2; published by Port√°l in 2007), and Polish (Polish title: U2 o U2; translated by ≈Åukasz G≈Çowacki and published by In Rock in 2009). Reception The book received favourable critical reviews. Edna Gundersen praised it stating that \\"[they] now offers the definitive version of how [U2] got there.\\" Entertainment Weekly's writer Michael Endelman wrote in his review of the book \\"[d]espite some fascinating details, the nearly 350 pages of as-told-to text is dense, sometimes sluggish\\", giving the book a B rating. Its international release, on 22 September 2006, have made it a bestseller in the United States, and the best selling music book in the world for 2006. It was listed in USA Today's Best-Selling Books list for 9 weeks, debuting on 5 October 2006 and peaking at number 30, and on The New York Times list of best sellers in the nonfiction category for 6 weeks, from November 2006 until January 2007, and peaking at number 14. It is a recommended book by the Irish America magazine. UnRated Magazine's journalist Trent McMartin in his 2008 review of the book wrote: \\"[f]ascinating, revealing, and at times long-winded, the most intriguing areas of the book are the early stages as the band struggles with youth, rejection, spirituality and upheaval at home. [‚Ä¶] [O]n the most part the band is in sequence despite the years, and in some cases decades of discrepancy. [‚Ä¶] [T]his passionate and insightful book is a joy regardless of its tendency to drift.

Morrill Tower, also known as The Towers, Morrill Tower or Lincoln Tower are two undergraduate residential houses at The Ohio State University. The Towers are located on the west campus of The Ohio State University across from the Drake Union off the east banks of the Olentangy River. Morrill Tower is to the right of Ohio Stadium on Cannon Drive. The towers are in close proximity of OSU's RPAC (Recreation and Physical Activity Center) and the Wexner Medical Center. History The Towers were dedicated on November 11, 1965 with the groundbreaking ceremony having been held in March 1965. The buildings were not completed until August 1967, but the first ten stories were completed and opened to students for the Autumn Quarter of 1966. =Morrill Tower= Justin S. Morrill Tower was named for Justin S. Morrill. Morrill was a U.S. Representative (and later Senator) from Vermont. Morrill introduced legislation, which would have had states sell public land in order to provide an endowment for a state university, which failed. Morrill reintroduced the bill to Congress in 1861, and this time it passed and was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862. The Land Grant‚Äîor Morrill‚ÄîAct, as the legislation came to be known, provided the means to establish The Ohio State University, and defined its mission. The Morrill Act stated that the proceeds from the sale of state lands was to go into an endowment fund that would enable designated colleges and universities to offer tuition more cheaply because of the federal support. It also stipulated that the designated colleges and universities teach both scientific and classical studies, as well as military training. (The bill was signed in the midst of the Civil War, and few men recruited had any grasp of military strategy or tactics.) It also stipulated that these universities and colleges provide mechanical and agricultural instruction. Morrill Tower is currently used for: * Floor 2 is used as a dining hall and campus store * Floor 3 is used as a lobby and the Student Life Office of Housing Administration * Floors 4-23 are used for residence hall purposes In 1978, serial killer and sex offender Jeffrey Dahmer enrolled at The Ohio State University and resided in Morrill Tower. Dahmer resided in Morrill Tower for only one quarter and never officially declared a major before flunking out of The Ohio State University. In February 1998, a fire broke out on the 5th floor. Students were evacuated, minimal damage occurred.https://news.osu.edu/news/1998/02/09/98-02-09_No_One_Injured_in_Residence_Hall_Fire/ In August 1998, a fire broke out in suite 550 of the tower, resulting in room 553 being completely destroyed.2013 Retrieved 2013. =Lincoln Tower= Abraham Lincoln Tower was named for the nation's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln because he signed the Morrill Act into law in 1862, which established the system of land-grant institutions in the U.S. and thus made the founding of this University possible. Originally constructed as a dormitory, the lower 14 floors were converted in 1975 into office space, while the top nine floors remained student housing. Lincoln Tower is currently used for: *Center for the Study of Student Life *Collegiate Recovery Community *Service2Facilities *Student Advocacy Center *Student Health Insurance *Student Life Budget and Planning *Student Life Facility Management and Logistics *Student Life Fiscal Support Services *Student Life Human Resources *Student Life Office of Student Conduct *The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Offices Floors 1-14 of the tower are used for office spaces, while floors 15-23 are used for residence hall student rooms Residence halls The rooms in both Lincoln and Morrill are set up very different from other dormitories on campus. Each floor consists of 6 suites, 1 laundry room, 1 resident advisor room, and 3 supply closets. Within each of the suites is a common room, bathroom (that includes three-four sinks, two showers and three restroom stalls), 4 rooms (each of which includes a study connected to a bedroom). Each suite usually have 8-12 students in each; rooms are quads, triples or doubles (with the exception of the suite directly next to the RA room, which has a single room in it). A typical floor is home to 60-70 students. The elevators in each of the residence halls are divided based on a low rise and high rise system. In Morrill, the low rise elevators go to floors 1, 3-14 and the high rise elevators goes to floors 1,3, 15-23. Only authorized officials can access floor 2 using the elevators. In Lincoln, low rise elevators reach floors 1-14, while high rise elevators reach floors 1,2, and 15-23. Each side of the building has 3 elevators. The halls are co-ed by suite.

The episode originally aired on September 30, 2012. It was directed by John Dahl and written by newly appointed showrunner Scott Buck. The series revolves around Dexter Morgan (portrayed by Michael C. Hall), a psychopathic serial killer who was raised by his adoptive father, Harry (James Remar), to adhere to a \\"Code.\\" Known to Dexter as \\"Harry's Code\\", this set of rules states that Dexter only kill criminals who deserve it, usually ones who have escaped legal justice, such as other serial killers, murderers and rapists. He works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department. Dexter has spent the last six seasons hiding his identity from his friends and family (only a few characters have learned of him and his MO throughout the series); especially from his sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), whom he is the closest to. The previous episode ended with Deb walking in on Dexter killing Travis Marshall (Colin Hanks), a religious-themed serial killer who Dexter and the police had spent the last season trying to apprehend. Dexter convinces Deb to help him cover up the murder, while trying to convince her the murder was a one-time event. The episode also introduced plotlines that would continue throughout the season, such as the introduction of the Russian Mafia. Dexter kills Viktor Baskov (Enver Gjokaj) for killing Miami Metro Detective Mike Anderson (Billy Brown), which prompts the arrival of Baskov's superior, Isaak Sirko (special guest star Ray Stevenson) in Miami. The episode also introduced a subplot involving Miami Metro Captain and Dexter and Debra's boss, Mar√≠a LaGuerta (Lauren V√©lez). The episode received near universal acclaim from critics. Many viewers had felt that the series had grown stale, repetitive and formulaic over the years, and especially criticized the sixth season as the series' low point. They welcomed the new and fresh direction the episode took, the fast pace, the relationship and interaction between Dexter and Debra and the acting of Hall and Carpenter. The Nielsen ratings were higher than any episode in the previous season. Plot The episode begins with a flashforward to Dexter hurrying in airport to catch a flight. He realizes his credit cards are cancelled. Deb walks in on Dexter killing Travis Marshall, the infamous \\"Doomsday Killer.\\" She pulls her gun and he tries to explain away the kill as self-defense and he \\"snapped\\". He explains the kill table and plastic wrap as it is his forensic instincts to get rid of the evidence. Deb wants to call it in, suggesting a temporary insanity plea or a good lawyer. Dexter dismisses this, saying his life, career and relationship to Harrison will be ruined, and instead suggests moving the body. She refuses, but then they agree to disguise it as a suicide. They set the church on fire with gasoline from a nearby gas station. However, Dexter drops his customary blood slide into a floor vent and does not notice it has gone. Miami Metro Police, including forensics expert Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee), Detective Mike Anderson (Billy Brown), Sergeant Angel Batista (David Zayas), Detective Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington) and Captain Maria LaGuerta, come to investigate the church. LaGuerta finds Dexter's broken blood slide. Dexter returns to his apartment and finds Louis Greene (Josh Cooke) on his side of his apartment and gets angry at him. Louis later complains about Dexter to his girlfriend and Harrison's babysitter Jamie Batista (Aimee Garcia) and cancels his credit cards. Dexter goes to put Travis's blood slide away, but realizes that he lost it. Flashbacks to Dexter and Deb's childhood demonstrate how Dexter's psychopathy has always affected Deb. Doris Morgan (Kathrin Lautner Middleton) surprises Deb with a dog, but Harry Morgan makes them take it back out of fear that Dexter will kill it. At one point, Dexter almost admits the reason to Deb but Harry stops him and tells him Deb wouldn't love the real him. Mike calls Deb, suspicious about it being a suicide since Travis's car was not at the church. He later sees a driver, Viktor Baskov (Enver Gjokaj) on the side of the road with a flat tire. He stops to help him but discovers the corpse of Katja Soroka, a stripper for a Ukrainian mob-run strip joint, the Foxhole, in his trunk. Viktor shoots him in panic, leaving the car and Soroka's corpse. Deb begins questioning Dexter's story about how Travis was his first murder, and questions why he was so prepared with the plastic wrap, knives and apron. He tries to deflect her questions, but she remains suspicious and watchful of him. The police investigate Mike's crime scene. Dexter finds a fingerprint match on Baskov's car to Baskov. Deb has flashbacks of the Ice Truck Killer's attempted murder of her and notices the similarities between his kill table and Dexter's killing of Travis. Angel and Quinn go to the Foxhole, but everyone denies knowing anything. They later reconcile their differences over a toast about Mike. The Foxhole's manager, George Novikov (Jason Gedrick), calls his superior Isaak Sirko in Kiev, Ukraine to tell him that Viktor has fled and is on a flight to Ukraine. Dexter, however, intercepts him at the airport and kills him, dumping the body in the ocean as usual. Deb visits Masuka who tells her that he agreed to work the late shift as long as Dexter worked in the morning, however, Deb then calls Jamie, who tells her that Dexter is at work and frequently works long hours until the night. Deb realizes that Dexter is lying and more memories come back which involve him and the Ice Truck Killer. LaGuerta asks Masuka about the blood slide, and Masuka reminds her of James Doakes, who was framed as the Bay Harbor Butcher. The episode ends with Dexter arriving at his apartment to find Deb, with his blood slides, weapons used for killing and the Ice Truck Killer prosthetic arm in front of her. She asks him if he's a serial killer, to which he responds \\"Yes.\\" Production Rome actor Ray Stevenson was cast as the season's main villain, Isaak Sirko, for nine episodes. Sirko was a high-ranking member of a Ukrainian crime syndicate. He was the first new cast member for season 7 to be cast. Dexter showrunner Scott Buck had previously worked on Rome as a writer. Stevenson was convinced to accept the role after Buck revealed that the character was gay and heartbroken and acting out of love and revenge on Dexter. He considered it a big opportunity to play such a pivotal role. Stevenson also enjoyed the personal stake the character had in killing Dexter. Jason Gedrick was cast as George Novikov, the owner of a crime-run Miami gentleman's club, in a multi-episode arc. Calista Flockhart was announced as a guest star in an unknown role, but did not end up appearing in the episode. Billy Brown makes his last appearance as Detective Mike Anderson. Scott Buck says Mike's death \\"was not taken lightly at all. It was done partially because Mike seemed to be the best cop in the precinct last season and because so much of our show is more about serial killers and about Dexter's secrets and stuff but we do take place in a police station which is an extremely dangerous place. And when police officers do die, it's always a horrible tragedy and often it's for the most silly minuscule reasons imaginable so we just try to play it as real as possible.\\" Josh Cooke and Aimee Garcia continue to appear as Louis Greene and Jamie Batista, respectively. Enver Gjokaj was cast in a one-episode guest role as Viktor Baskov, originally named Viktor Karev. Nicholas Vigneau and Savannah Paige Rae were cast as Dexter and Debra as children for flashback scenes. Kathrin Middleton as Doris Morgan. Andrew Kirsanov makes his first in a set of recurring appearance as Isaak's loyal bodyguard, Jurg Yeliashkevych. Dana L. Wilson was cast as recurring Miami Metro Detective Angie Miller. Scott Buck says Deb discovering Dexter's secret is a \\"story we've talked about doing for a long time but it was never a story we wanted to do early on in the run of the show because it is such a big moment and the more you can build up it to the more significant it is. It just felt like we teased the audience long enough. It was finally time to pull that punch and do that story. [...] It's a story we've been wanting to tell for a long time.\\" Of writing the first scene in the church, Buck recalls \\"I just really loved writing that scene [...] because it had been in the back of our minds for so long, there were so many things that we knew we had to do in that scene. And it's almost like there's so many things you want to put in that scene and then you have to start pulling them out because it becomes too much and those little gems actually become parts of other episodes and stuff because eventually everything comes out.\\" He also said about the pace \\"We have decided consciously this season to move things along a bit faster and not to play things out quite so slowly and not to tease the audience as much, to tease them but to answer that pretty quickly on.\\" Michael C. Hall says \\"It fundamentally changes [their dynamic] ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a relief and yet simultaneously a huge problem and a real bear for [them both] to wrestle with.\\" Reception =Ratings= 2.40 million viewers watched \\"Are You...?,\\" the largest audience since the fifth season finale. =Critical reception= The episode received highly positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN, like many other critics, was disappointed in season 6, and wrote \\"Are You...? does its best to speedboat past that forgettable year and deliver unto us a thrilling and viable endgame to the entire Dexter saga. He called the episode a \\"return to form\\" and that the episode \\"has assuaged most of [his] fears and given us some terrific new terrain to explore.\\" He concludes his review by writing that \\"Are You...?\\" was a well-crafted and promising way to kick start this later season, and it left me with goosebumps and excitement for the rest of this year's story.\\" Fowler also praised Jennifer Carpenter's \\"truly memorable performance that horrifically encapsulated the entire series to date.\\" Cory Barker of TV.com agreed that the last season was a \\"disaster\\" and formulaic and thought Dexter was on \\"its last creative legs,\\" but was pleasantly surprised by the episode. \\"The episode was structured really well in that it kept trying to slide back into typical Dexter rhythms‚Äîsome case of the week, lots of Dexter internal monologuing, etc.‚Äîbut every time it did, Deb‚Äôs concern and curiosity disrupted the proceedings.\\" The A.V. Club rated the episode an \\"A-\\", and agreed the sixth season \\"represented the death knell of the series, [...] but \\"Are You...?\\" represents a different Dexter.\\" The reviewer especially praised the opening scene in the church, praising Buck's writing and Hall and Carpenter's performances. The review sums up with \\"Dexter appears to be, at long last, back on his game.\\" The episode \\"lends a momentum that has been absent from the show since season two.\\" Drusilla Moorhouse of Zap2it praised the premiere as even better than expected. Alan Sepinwall lauded that although he was disillusioned with the sixth season because of the unchanging status quo and thus lack of stakes and danger, \\"Are You...?\\" gave him renewed hope for the series and \\"demonstrates just how much potential \\"Dexter\\" was wasting by avoiding consequences or paradigm shifts. [It] shakes the series out of the doldrums it's been in for several years now.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complained \\"Dexter had grown stale,\\" and called season 6 \\"atrocious.\\" However, Richenthal called the season 7 premiere \\"pure tension from beginning to end. [...] Just a terrific premiere all around, enough to help me forget all about [season 6].\\" He also praised Hall and Carpenter's acting. Jarrett Kruse of Mania wrote \\"Whatever worries we had about the last two seasons, they are wiped away in as good an opener of a series finale year ever.\\" James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly opined the episode is \\"far superior to any episode from the contrived and lackluster sixth season.\\" Alex Moaba of The Huffington Post called the premiere \\"a game-changing episode that breathed new life into the series. [...] \\"Dexter\\" has embraced the freedom to ditch some its more tedious procedural elements and refocus on its new central tension. [...] Deb's struggle [...] showed just how suspenseful, complicated and emotionally- resonant \\"Dexter\\" can still be.\\" Anthony Ocasio of Screenrant calls the beginning as a moment that viewers have waited to see since the series premiered and praised their conversations' anticipation. He also enjoyed Deb asking Dexter all the right questions. The episode \\"Almost allowing us to see Dexter‚Äôs actions through Deb‚Äôs eyes,\\" and noted how Dexter's Dark Passenger has always affected Deb. Kelly West of Cinema Blend wrote \\"given that the series had started to show its age in recent years, it's probably about time to explore this avenue. Not since Rita's death has something changed so drastically in Dexter's life, so it's going to be very exciting to see how this affects the series as much as how it will affect Deb and Dexter's relationship. From the first few episodes, the start of this transition feels true to the show and the characters.\\" Alyse Wax of Fearnet wrote \\"Deb found out. It was inevitable that she discover Dexter‚Äôs secret, and some may say it took too long. But you don‚Äôt want to blow that wad too early in a series, and it was necessary for Deb to gain a high-ranking status in the department. She needed to have more power to manipulate the situation, and more to lose. The season six cliffhanger, with Deb walking in on Dexter, was exactly the right cliffhanger. You have to leave the season there because the anticipation that builds is insane.\\" On Metacritic, the episode had a rating of 81/100 based on 7 critics' reviews and a rating of 8.5 (\\"universal acclaim\\") based on 327 ratings. Critics also praised the ending cliffhanger. Fowler praised the writers for not stalling for the ending, and for Deb discovering Dexter had killed many times before. Matt Fowler said \\"Given the past few years, it would not have been beyond this series to drag that particular journey out, but they squashed it in the first episode.\\" Gregory Eckert of Paste wrote \\"I found the last scene of the premiere not only tense (and possibly one of the best scenes to date), but couldn't help feeling relieved that Dexter no longer needs to lie to Deb.\\" Cory Barker of TV.com praised the ending, noting that the episode lulled him into a false sense that Deb would belief Travis to be Dexter's only kill. He was positive about Deb's character investigating Dexter, and said \\"It's taken over 70 episodes, many of them mediocre, to get to that moment, but man, it almost feels worth it.\\" Kelly West of Cinema Blend wrote \\"Deb stayed true to her character by being a good investigator and investigating Dexter. [...] I like that she knows for sure. We could've been looking at a full season of Deb asking questions and Dexter trying to convince her he's not a serial killer. For the sake of the show, I think it'll be better for Deb to have the truth outright than to spend a season wondering and obsessing.\\" Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush was worried that it would take the whole season for Deb to find out Dexter was a serial killer, and thus praised the ending. However, he was weary of the Ukrainian mob plotline. The subplots received more mixed reviews than Dexter and Deb's story. Matt Fowler opined that Mike's death subplot and the Ukrainian crime organization was not as intriguing. He was more positive and looking forward to LaGuerta's and Louis's storylines. The A.V. Club felt Dexter's tracking down and killing of Baskov repetitive and unoriginal. Fowler, Kelly West and AV Club both found the airport kill scene unrealistic. Aria Mohtadi of Seriable praised Deb and LaGuerta's plotlines, but thought that the supporting characters were boring. Katie Waldman of Slate thought the Ukrainians seemed clich√©d. Cory Barker of TV.com wrote \\"I don't really care that LaGuerta is suddenly interested in the blood slide that Dexter accidentally left at the crime scene. And I certainly am unmoved by Batista and Quinn barking at each other to change when we know that they won't,\\" and also found Dexter killing Viktor too \\"familiar and unimpressive.\\" Kelly West called Mike's death a \\"shame\\" and a \\"waste,\\" though not tragic as the character had not been known long. Critics also praised the references to past episodes such as the Ice Truck Killer. Katie Waldman of Slate thought the references to past seasons, including the Ice Truck Killer, Rita, the Trinity Killer and Doakes, made the world of Dexter more layered and complete.

The HEXITEC consortium was formed in 2006 funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK. The consortium is led by the University of Manchester; other members include the Science and Technology Facilities Council, the University of Surrey, Durham University and University of London, Birkbeck. In 2010 the consortium expanded to include the Royal Surrey County Hospital and the University College London. The vision of the consortium was to \\"develop a UK- based capability in high energy X-ray imaging technology\\". It is now available commercially through Quantum Detectors.  High energy X-ray imaging technology  X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique that provides qualitative information about the elemental composition and internal stresses and strain within a specimen. High energy X-rays have the ability to penetrate deeply into materials allowing the examination of dense objects such as welds in steel, geological core sections bearing oil or gas or for the internal observation of chemical reactions inside heavy plant or machinery. Different experimental techniques such as X-ray fluorescence imaging and X-Ray diffraction imaging require X-ray detectors that are sensitive over a broad range of energies. Established semiconductor detector technology based on silicon and germanium have excellent energy resolution at X-ray energies under 30 keV but above this, due to a reduction in the material mass attenuation coefficient, the detection efficiency is dramatically reduced. To detect high energy X-rays, detectors produced from higher density materials are required. High density, compound semiconductors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe), gallium arsenide (GaAs), mercuric iodide or thallium bromide have been the subject of extensive research for use in high energy X-ray detection. The favorable charge transport properties and high electrical resistivity of CdTe and CdZnTe have made them ideally suited to applications requiring spectroscopy at higher X-ray energies. Imaging applications, such as SPECT, require detectors with a pixelated electrode that allow objects to be imaged in 2D and 3D. Each pixel of the detector requires its own chain of readout electronics and for a highly pixelated detector this requires the use of a high sensitivity application-specific integrated circuit.  The HEXITEC ASIC  The HEXITEC application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was developed for the consortium by the Science and Technology Facilities Council Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The initial prototype consisted of an array of 20 x 20 pixels on a 250Œºm pitch fabricated using a 0.35Œºm CMOS process; the second generation of the ASIC expanded the array size to 80 x 80 pixels (4 cm2). Each ASIC pixel contains a charge amplifier, a CR- RC shaping amplifier and a peak track-and-hold circuit. The ASIC records the position and total charge deposited for each X-ray event detected.  The PIXIE ASIC  A typical X-ray / gamma-ray spectrum collected with the HEXITEC detector The PIXIE ASIC is a research and development ASIC developed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for the consortium. The ASIC is being used to investigate charge induction and the small pixel effect in semiconductor detectors as described by the Shockley‚ÄìRamo theorem. The ASIC consists of three separate arrays of 3 x 3 pixels on a 250Œºm pitch and a single array of 3 x 3 pixels on a 500Œºm pitch. Each pixel contains a charge amplifier and output buffer allowing the induced charge pulses of each pixel to be recorded.  HEXITEC detectors  HEXITEC ASICs are flip-chip bonded to a direct conversion semiconductor detector using a low temperature (~100 ¬∞C) curing silver epoxy and gold stud technique in a hybrid detector arrangement. The X-ray detector layer is a semiconductor, typically cadmium telluride (CdTe) or cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe), between 1 ‚Äì 3 mm thick. The detectors consist of a planar cathode and a pixelated anode and are operated under a negative bias voltage. X-ray and Œé-rays interacting within the detector layer form charge clouds of electron-hole pairs which drift from the cathode to the anode pixels. The charge drifting across the detectors induce charge on the ASIC pixels as described by the Shockley‚ÄìRamo theorem which form the detected signal. The detectors are capable of measuring an X-ray/Œé-ray photo-peak FWHM of the order 1 keV in the energy range 3 - 200 keV.  Applications  HEXITEC detectors are in use in a number of different application areas including: materials science, medical imaging, illicit material detection, and X-ray astronomy.

The organisation was working on the political ground of an anti-capitalist, revolutionary and libertarian socialist platform. LS had local groups in Copenhagen, Aalborg and Odense and these groups were linked together in a federation, which was described in details the organization's rules. LS was described as \\"the most important and most visible representative of the anarchist trend in Denmark\\". LS describe themselves on their website as \\"a federation of independent local groups that seek to promote the fight for libertarian socialism: a stateless socialist council society based on federalism and direct democracy.\\". LS was an anti-parliamentarist organization and rejected any participation in elections. Instead LS advocates and uses the direct-action-methods of mass anarchism and syndicalism: strikes, blocades, occupations, sabotage, work-to-rule, boycotts, slowdown, demonstrations, etc. LS consider the revolutionary general strike and the popular insurrection as the ultimate weapons that can end capitalism and statism and bring about a libertarian socialist society. In 2017, after a period of in-activity, LS was dissolved. Activities The local LS-groups arranged lectures and discussion meetings and get involved in political struggles and movements relating to environment and climate, industrial and social conflicts, anti-racism, anti- militarism, gender politics etc. The organisation had in several cases defended the use of political militancy under certain circumstances. During the protests at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP15) in 2009, 913 were arrested in a mass arrest and as part of this maneuver all involved in the LS block in the demonstration were arrested. Many of those arrested sued the police for wrongful arrest and at the end of the case the arrests were found to be illegal, and the police were ordered to pay damages. At the labor movements May Day meetings in 2013 LS participated in protests against the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party and the policy they have led after the change of government in 2011 (In Copenhagen LS played a leading role in these protests). During the protests there were claims by both sides of aggressive behaviour from the other side, some of which were later retracted. The protests had the effect that speakers from the Social Democrats and SF had to interrupt their speeches ahead of time at the meetings in Copenhagen, Aalborg, Aarhus and other cities. Direkte Aktion LS published the magazine Direkte Aktion, which began to be published in February 2011. International relations Internationally, LS joined the Anarkismo-network and is helping to edit the website Anarkismo.net and the Anarchist Black Cat forums. LS participates in international conferences of the Anarkismo-network and is working together with other affiliated organizations on joint campaigns. The Anarkismo-network's European branch has created EuroAnarkismo with the aim of strengthening the international cooperation and the anarchist movement in Europe. By joining the Anarkismo-network LS has placed itself within the platformist-especifist tradition of the international anarchist movement.

HI-SEAS is located in an isolated position on the slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii. The area has Mars-like features and an elevation of approximately above sea level. The first HI-SEAS study was in 2013 and NASA's Human Research Program continues to fund and sponsor follow-up studies. The missions are of extended duration from four months to a year. The purpose of the detailed research studies is to determine what is required to keep a space flight crew happy and healthy during an extended mission to Mars and while living on Mars. Research into food, crew dynamics, behaviors, roles and performance, and other aspects of space flight and a mission on Mars itself is the primary focus. The HI-SEAS researchers also carry out studies on a variety of other topics as part of their daily activities. One thing under study by NASA is trying to understand crew dynamics such as morale, stress management, and how they solve problems as group. Missions =HI-SEAS I= The first HI-SEAS mission lasted for four months from mid-April to 13 November 2013 with culinary and psychological aspects. Many related aspects were also explored, including temperatures in artificial habitats. It was orchestrated primarily by NASA, University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa, and Cornell University. The 2013 study included 8 people and ran for 120 days (4 months). The crew members were Angelo Vermeulen (commander, Belgium), Simon Engler (engineer, Canada), Kate Greene (writer, USA), Yajaira Sierra Sastre (scientist, USA), Oleg Abramov (geologist, USA), Sian Proctor (education outreach, USA). Members of the HI-SEAS crew went outside the habitat once a week in simulated spacesuits to explore the terrain and to perform geological and microbe-detection studies. The focus of the study was on a diet which consisted of traditional space food (such as freeze- dried items) as well as various recipes made from a special list of ingredients. Six scientists completed the study. Mission commander Angelo Vermeulen with his colleagues recommended more spices and higher fiber foods as well as comfort foods. =HI-SEAS II= HI-SEAS II with a crew of six people began 28 March 2014 and lasted 120 days, until 25 July 2014. The crew members were Casey Stedman (commander, USA), Tiffany Swarmer (USA), Ron Williams (USA), Anne Caraccio (USA), Ross Lockwood (Canada), and Lucie Poulet (France). =HI-SEAS III= HI-SEAS III began on 15 October 2014, and included six crew members and two reserve crew members: Martha Lenio (Commander), Allen Mirkadyrov, Sophie Milam, Neil Sheibelhut, Jocelyn Dunn, and Zak Wilson. Backup crew included Ed Fix and Micheal Castro. The mission ended on 13 June 2015. This was the first 8-month stay for a crew and the third overall HI-SEAS mission. NASA used the study to examine and gain knowledge about crew size, isolation, and group communication and problem resolution dynamics. One question is ideal crew size, and like the previous mission this one included a crew of six people, but for double the amount of time as the previous missions. The crew on HSIII performed 40 tasks a week for research studies. One of the experiments was on 3D printing. =HI-SEAS IV= HI-SEAS IV began on 28 August 2015 and lasted until 28 August 2016: 366 days due to the leap year. The crew members were Carmel Johnston (USA), Christiane Heinicke (Germany), Dr. Sheyna Gifford (USA), Andrzej Stewart (USA/UK), Cyprien Verseux (France), and Tristan Bassingthwaighte (USA). The backup crew included Oscar Mathews and Debbi-Lee Wilkinson. The mission positions of HI-SEAS IV included the following specialities: commander, physicist, astrobiologist, physician, engineer, space architect, and journalist. The crew of six spent the whole year together on this mission. One of the major tasks was simply getting along with another in isolation as well as resolving interpersonal conflict if it occurred. Challenges the crew had to overcome during the mission included un- planned supply issues, water systems failures, and a communications failure. During the mission many aspects of a Mars mission were simulated (see Mars analog habitat), such as a communication delay time and isolation. Many aspects of a Mars mission were not simulated, such as the reduced gravity of Mars. They did live at a higher altitude, which would have slightly boosted radiation exposure from space radiation. During the mission, all six crew- members blogged and several were featured on professional websites such as the Huffington Post, Aeon, and Narratively. The mission is also the subject of a film called Red Heaven, currently in post-production. Finally, HI-SEAS IV is the subject of the Gimlet Media podcast The Habitat. The mission ended on 28 August 2016, with the crew emerging to a crowd of news media and cameramen. This was the longest HI-SEAS yet, and the longest NASA-funded space simulation in history, with the previous mission lasting 8 months, and before that 4 months. =HI-SEAS V= HI-SEAS V began on 19 January 2017 and was scheduled to run for eight months. The crew consists of Ansley Barnard (USA), James Bevington (USA), Joshua Ehrlich (USA), Laura Lark (USA), Brian Ramos (USA), and Samuel Payler (UK). The six researchers, made up of engineers, a computer scientist, an astrobiologist, and a biomedical expert, focused on team dynamics and its effect on performance. In September 2017, the crew emerged from their 8-month long mission in the mock Mars habitat. =HI-SEAS VI= Hi- SEAS VI began on 15 February 2018 and was due to last eight months with a crew of four consisting of Sukjin Han (Korea), Calum Hervieu (Scotland), Lisa Stojanovski (Australia), and Michaela Musilova (Slovakia). However, the mission had to be halted on Sol 4 (19 February 2018) when a crew member was admitted to Hilo Medical Center. Hawaii News Now reported that the simulation had been halted while the Dome was inspected following the incident where a crew member suffered an electrical shock. The crew member is reported to be in a stable condition. Data Mining In 2018, rather than conduct a HI-SEAS VII, NASA issued a new grant to support enhanced data mining of the previous five missions and analysis of a HI-SEAS database.

It presently serves as a local history museum, open for tours by appointment. Description and history The Indian Stream Schoolhouse stands in southern Pittsburg, on the west side of Tabor Road, just west of its junction with United States Route 3, amid a small cluster of houses. The eponymous Indian Stream flows south toward the Connecticut River a short way to the east. The school is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its roof is topped by a small square open belfry. The main facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows with shallow corniced lintels. A pair of similar windows appear in the attic level. The building corners have pilaster-like raised corner boards, and there are decorative jigsawn brackets at the corners of the eaves. The schoolhouse was built in 1897 and operated as a school until 1939. It was originally built and furnished for just a few hundred dollars, and was one of nine district schools in the town in 1900. After it closed, it stood vacant and fell into disrepair until the early 21st century. The schoolhouse was restored by a group of former students and other community members, and still includes many of the original furnishings. Financial records from its early years still exist, such as documentation for $12 paid on June 30, 1908 for painting the schoolhouse.

The documentary is about the 1970s rock band Death and their new-found popularity decades after the group recorded their music. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2012 and was well received by film critics. Synopsis A Band Called Death is the story of three musician brothers, born to a Baptist preacher and his wife in 1950s Detroit. In their teenage years, the three brothers (to five other siblings) emerge as, first, a budding rock/funk band, heavily influenced by Motown & Parliament, ultimately evolving into pioneers of punk music, Death. Influenced by music by Alice Cooper and The Who, the group was heavily steered by the guidance and decisions of visionary eldest brother and guitarist, David Hackney. The story follows the brothers' unsuccessful attempts to get radio airplay and a record deal, largely due to David's adamant refusal to change the name from Death. An eventual trek east finds the boys in Burlington, Vermont, living with relatives and reflecting on the failure of David's vision. We begin to explore post-Death projects in The 4th Movement, a gospel/rock band with the same line-up. However, after two years of being homesick, David returns to Detroit, leaving Dannis and Bobby to form a lively reggae band called Lambsbread. The film also focuses on the intense brotherly bond between the group members, and their personal lives, including David Hackney's battle with alcoholism, his death in 2000 and his family members' reactions to these events. The film follows the re-discovery of the group through record collectors leading to an eventual release of Death's album ...For the Whole World to See by the Drag City record label and the group's eventual reunion and touring with a new guitarist. Production Director Jeff Howlett met Bobby Hackney Sr. and Dannis Hackney in the 1990s at a local music festival where his band and their band, Lambsbread, were playing. Bobby Hackney Jr. had formed his own band Rough Francis with his brothers to honor his father's band Death. After Howlett saw the show, he was impressed with the music and with Bobby Jr. and his father, and they began working on the documentary. In 2008, Mark Covino met Howlett while working on a video that Howlett was directing. The next year, Howlett approached Covino to work on the film with him, but Covino was initially hesitant about helping Howlett as he was attempting to finish his own documentary feature at the time. He changed his mind after reading an article in The New York Times on the group and hearing the two songs from the \\"Politicians in my Eyes\\" 7\\" single. Covino spent months organizing and scanning photos from members of the groups family from Vermont, Ohio and Detroit. Very little video footage of the group's guitarist David Hackney surfaced during their duo's research. Release A Band Called Death had its world premiere at the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival on June 16. It was acquired by Drafthouse Films shortly before screening at South By Southwest in 2013. The film was released on DVD and blu-ray disc on August 13, 2013. Reception Initial critical response to A Band Called Death was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 77, based on 14 reviews.

His reports provide a detailed account of the situation of the Armenian deportees in the Syrian Desert. While in Aleppo, he witnessed thousands die of exposure and starvation. Greatly saddened and affected by the scenes he witnessed, he ultimately committed suicide on November 7, 1915. Early life Geddes was born on November 13, 1885 in Newark, New Jersey to Alexander Geddes and Susan Isabel Geddes (n√©e Baker). His father was of Scottish descent and his mother was of English descent. He studied at Stevens Institute of Technology for a year and then spent five years in Saskatchewan, Canada and Montana where he traveled. He graduated from Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1911 and married Rebekah Virginia Botsford on October 13, 1912 in Denver, Colorado. In 1912 he became a solicitor for Peters, Byrne & Company who were tree surgeons in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1913 he and his wife moved to Asia Minor as a result of his decision to join the licorice business which his father had already established. Their son, George Baker Geddes, was born in Damascus. Armenian Genocide Geddes left for the Ottoman Empire in March 1913 in search of licorice root to expand his business. Having learned Arabic in order to conduct business locally, he left for Aleppo on September 16, 1915. After first passing an encampment of Armenians at Afyonkarahisar, he went to Konia where he witnessed the separation of a woman and her baby from her husband. The husband was then placed on a train while the woman was \\"forcibly held behind and kept from getting on the train\\". On arrival in Aleppo, Geddes notes that the situation of the Armenians was \\"beyond description\\" and that they were \\"dying by the hundreds a day\\". He then describes the situation of the British Consulate filled with exiles, saying that \\"the dead were removed almost every hour\\" and adding that \\"coffin-makers throughout the city were working late into the night, making rough boxes for the dead whose relatives or friends could afford to give them decent burial\\". Geddes, who left Aleppo and arrived in Damascus, writes that, \\"several Turks[,] whom I interviewed, told me that the motive of this exile was to exterminate the race\\". He added that he did not see \\"any Moslem giving alms to Armenians, it being considered a criminal offence for anyone to aid them\\". He stated that the situation in Damascus was similar to the situation in Aleppo where hundreds of Armenians were also dying every day. He added that from Damascus, the Armenians were \\"sent still farther south into the Hauran, where their fate is unknown\\". On October 26, 1915, Geddes left Aleppo and headed for Smyrna and passed through Bozanti. He describes the situation near Bozanti as follows: > There seems to be no end to the caravan which moves over the mountain ridge > from Bozanti south; throughout the day from sunrise to sunset, the road as > far as one can see is crowded with these exiles. Just outside of Tarsus I > saw a dead woman lying by the roadside and farther on passed two more dead > women, one of whom was being carried by two gendarmes away from the roadside > to be buried. Her legs and arms were so emaciated that the bones were nearly > through her flesh and her face was swollen and purple from exposure. Farther > along, I saw two gendarmes carrying a dead child between them away from the > road where they had dug a grave. Many of these soldiers and gendarmes who > follow the caravan have spades and as soon as an Armenian dies they take the > corpse away from the roadside and bury it. Geddes also writes about his encounter with a woman who had been in Bozanti for two days and had been unable to eat anything except what travelers had given her: > At many places like Bozanti, for example, where there is an encampment of > Turkish soldiers, there is not enough bread for these Armenians and only two > hours from Bozanti I met a woman who was crying for bread. She told me that > she had been in Bozanti for two days and was unable to obtain anything to > eat, except what travelers like myself had given her. Many of the beasts of > burden belonging to the Armenians die of starvation. It is not an unusual > sight to see an Armenian removing a pack from the dead animal and putting it > on his own shoulders. Many Armenians told me that although they were allowed > to rest at night, they get no sleep because of the pangs of hunger and cold. Geddes continues to write about the circumstances of families and children: > Diseases broke out in several places along the road, and in Aleppo several > cases of typhus fever among the Armenians were reported when I left. Many > families have been separated, the men being sent in one direction and the > women and children in another. I saw one woman, who was with child, lying in > the middle of the road crying, and over her stood a gendarme threatening her > if she did not get up and walk. Many children are born along the way and > most of these die as their mothers have no nourishment for them. Geddes concludes that \\"the sights that I saw on my return trip were worse than those on my trip going\\". Death George Horton, American Consul General in Smyrna, reported the death of Geddes to the State Department of the United States: > Mr. Geddes committed suicide by shooting himself through the head with a > revolver at his room in the Kraemer Hotel of this city early on the morning > of the 7th November 1915. He was seen by myself and others on the preceding > afternoon and was perfectly sane and natural in his behaviour and manner of > talking giving no indication that he contemplated taking away his life. It > is the opinion of those who knew him best here that certain experiences > which he has passed through since he has been in Turkey preyed heavily upon > his mind. He was dragged from his horse at Alexandretta in the month of > October 1914 by Turkish soldiers, beaten and otherwise maltreated and thrown > into prison. Just recently in returning from Aleppo, he passed for days > through the scenes which are resulting from the measures which are being > taken against the Armenians by the Turkish Authorities. It was noticed that > he was greatly changed and saddened on his return from Aleppo. In dictating > to the stenographer of the Consulate General an account of what he saw, he > broke down several times. He was particularly affected in speaking of the > sufferings and deaths of the children who were perishing in thousands. He was survived by his wife and their son, who had returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War I.

Cordill (October 13, 1845 - November 22, 1916), was a cotton planter and politician from Tensas Parish in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Louisiana. He was a member of the Louisiana State Senate from 1884 until 1912 in which he represented both Tensas and neighboring Concordia Parish to the south. Background Cordill was born in rural Coahoma in Coahoma County near Clarksdale in northwestern Mississippi, the oldest of four children of Joseph Cordill (1816 - 1887) and his first wife, the former Mary Jane Sisson (1828 - 1860). Mary Jane died in childbirth when Charles was fourteen years of age though the child, Francis Marion Cordill (1860-1901), Charles' brother, survived. In 1868, Joseph Cordill married Mary Lu Woodward, and the couple had four children between 1869 and 1877, Charles' half- siblings. It is unclear when Cordill moved to Tensas Parish, probably 1867 or 1868, but it seems likely that he was reared prior to the American Civil War in adjoining Franklin Parish to the west. He was a merchant before he amassed a fortune as a planter. According to the 1899 property tax rolls, Cordill owned more than three thousand acres, the majority on his Kenilworth Plantation. He had ninety mules and some twenty-five wagons. His annual tax bill exceeded $1,000. Political career In the state Senate, Cordill was for a time the chairman of the Agriculture, Commerce, and Levee committees. The latter was particularly important to a river parish like Tensas. Cordill was considered the political boss of Tensas Parish. He was elected parish judge, based in St. Joseph, as a Republican c. 1874, before he was yet thirty years of age. During Reconstruction, he was an ally of Carpetbagger Governor Henry Clay Warmoth. When Reconstruction ended, Cordill quickly turned Democrat to preserve his political power. The judge held court in all kinds of cases every other month six times a year. Cordill was also for twenty-five years the president of the Tensas Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body; at the time a legislator could also serve on the police jury, as both are part-time positions. Cordill's political power rested on the firm support from the white landowners at a time when the African-American constituency was disenfranchised despite the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Tensas Parish at the time had a much greater black population than it does today though it is still a majority black parish. The 1900 census showed Tensas with 1,231 whites and 17,839 blacks. Cordill's power was challenged in the 1878 general election by a coalition of former Confederate white yeoman farmers and blacks who joined together in the \\"Country People's Ticket\\". He quickly beat his opponents into submission with physical force even before the election to unseat him could be held. In 1878, Judge Cordill, a staunch segregationist, pursued a band of African Americans who had killed a Captain Peck of Catahoula Parish. According to \\"Vignettes\\" of the American Civil War by Francis McRae Ward, Cordill and his posse of one hundred reached Bass Lane, about a mile north of Waterproof in southern Tensas Parish, in the area near Cordill's plantation, and came upon some approximately one thousand blacks. Rather than wait for reinforcements, Cordill ordered an attack with the expectation, correct as it turned out, that the blacks would flee, rather than fight. Cordill's hunch was based on an event during the Civil War when he, still teenager, and four other soldiers routed a whole company of black soldiers in this same area. Cordill and his men charged, fired their weapons, and yelled loudly. As Cordill had expected the blacks dismounted their horses, fled, and hid in the nearby cotton fields. The challenge to Cordill's rule hence ended with a whimper. The posse members included Carneal Goldman, Sr., a Waterproof planter, and William Mackenzie Davidson, later the first mayor of St. Joseph after incorporation. Cordill also exercised for years what was called \\"almost dictatorial power\\" of the Fifth District Levee Board, whose member also included the influential Jefferson B. Snyder, a St. Joseph native who served for forty-four years as an area district attorney.Tensas Gazette, November 24, 1916Frederick W. Williamson and George T. Goodman, eds. Eastern Louisiana: A History of the Watershed of the Ouachita River and the Florida Parishes, 3 vols. (Monroe: Historical Record Association, 1939, pp. 569-571) Death and legacy Cordill's will was probated in New Orleans less than a month after his death. Sources do not indicated his place of death. He had more than a million dollars in assets at the time of his passing. Having never married, Cordill left much of his wealth to siblings, nieces, and nephews. He designated $50,000 to a sister, Mattie Cordill Cassidy, of Greenwood, Mississippi, and $40,000 to his namesake nephew, C. C. Cordill, a son of his brother, William Cordill. The other sons of William Cordill receive lesser amounts. Cordill left $10,000 to New Orleans Charity Hospital. He left $1,500 to a servant, Nathaniel Cullens. The will had four codicils and stipulated that anyone contesting its validity or findings would forfeit whatever he would have otherwise received. Cordill is interred at Natchez City Cemetery in Natchez, Mississippi.
