Matins was composed of one to three nocturns. Originating in a prayer service celebrated by early Christians at night, the liturgical office of matins was originally in Latin called vigilia (vigil, watch). The plural form, vigiliae (vigils, watches), also came into use. The Latin adjective nocturnus corresponds to English \\"nocturnal\\" and is attached to many different nouns, such as nocturnae horae (the hours of the night), nocturna tempora (nocturnal times), which are not necessarily connected with religion and are unrelated to the subject of this article. The phrase hora nocturna (night hour) may refer to the canonical hour of vigils or matins, but not to the individual nocturns into which vigils or matins may be divided.  Pre-nocturn period  The early-Christian custom of praying at night is mentioned by Tertullian (c. 155 ‚Äì c. 240), who speaks of their \\"nocturnal convocations\\" and their \\"absence all the night long at the paschal solemnities\\" (nocturnae convocationes, sollemnibus Paschae abnoctantes)Tertullian, Ad uxorem, II,4 ; Latin text Cyprian (c. 200 ‚Äì 258) also speaks of praying at night, but not of doing so as a group: \\"Let there be no failure of prayers in the hours of night ‚Äî no idle and reckless waste of the occasions of prayer\\"(nulla sint horis nocturnis precum damna, nulla orationum pigra et ignava dispendia).Cyprian, De oratione dominica, 36 (near end); Latin text The Apostolic Tradition speaks of prayer at midnight and again at cockcrow, but seemingly as private, not communal, prayer.Robert F. Taft, The Liturgy of the Hours in East and West: The Origins of the Divine Office and Its Meaning for Today (Liturgical Press 1986), pp. 25‚Äì26 Prayer at midnight and at cockcrow was associated with passages in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark.Taft (1986), p. 35 On the basis of the Gospel of Luke too, prayer at any time of the night was also seen as having eschatological significance.Taft (1986), p. 15 The quotation above from Tertullian refers to the all-night vigil service held at Easter. A similar service came to be held in the night that led to any Sunday. It corresponded in a way to the later early-night vespers, midnight vigil and dawn lauds and was sometimes referred to as three vigils or watches (vigiliae), as by Methodius of Olympus and Jerome.Fernand Cabrol, \\"Nocturns\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911) vol. 11, pp. 87‚Äì88 By the fourth century this Sunday vigil had become a daily observance, but no longer lasted throughout the night. What had been an all- night vigil became a service only from cockcrow to before dawn.Lallou, William J. \\"Introduction to the Roman Breviary\\", Roman Breviary In English, Benziger Brothers, Inc, 1950 Saint Benedict wrote about it as beginning at about 2 in the morning (\\"the eighth hour of the night\\") and ending in winter well before dawn (leaving an interval in which the monks were to devote themselves to study or meditation) but having to be curtailed in summer in order to celebrate lauds at daybreak.  Rise of the monastic cursus  In the writings of John Cassian (c. 360‚Äì435) is found the earliest mention of dividing the vigil service into three parts, thus breaking the monotony of the long night prayer. The Peregrinatio ad loca sancta of about 380 still gave no evidence of any division of the office of vigils whether on Sundays or on weekdays. Statue of Saint Benedict of Nursia Saint Benedict of Nursia (480 ‚Äì c. 543 or 547) gives a detailed description of the division of vigils into two parts (for which he does not use the name \\"nocturns\\") on ordinary days, and three on Sundays and feast-days. The term nocturnus (nocturnal) appears nine times in his Rule. As an adjective four times (chapters 9, 10, 16 and 43) qualifying vigiliae (vigils), once (chapter 9) qualifying psalmi (psalms), once (chapter 10) qualifying laus (praise), and once (chapter 42) qualifying hora (hour). It appears twice (chapters 15 and 17) in the plural form, nocturni, with no express mention of a qualified noun, and thus practically as itself a noun equivalent to vigiliae. Psalmi (psalms) may be the masculine plural noun that it was originally understood as qualifying. In chapter 17, the phrase used is nocturni vel matutini, mentioned in relation to the psalms of the two hours that were later called matins and lauds, as a prelude to speaking of the psalms in the six other canonical hours.Regula S.P.N. Benedicti Leonard J. Doyle's English version of the Rule of St Benedict translates horis nocturnis in chapter 42 as \\"the hours of the night\\", but elsewhere uses \\"the Night Office\\" to represent the entirety of each phrase in the Rule consisting of one of the nouns vigiliae, laus, hora, qualified by nocturnus; to render an isolated nocturnus in chapters 15 and 17; and to translate vigiliae wherever it appears unaccompanied by nocturnus. Nowhere does it use the word \\"nocturns\\".St Benedict's Rule for Monasteries The Rule of St Benedict laid down that on ordinary days, after the introductory psalms, there were two nocturns. The first consisted of six psalms followed by three reading, each of which was accompanied by a sung responsory. The second nocturn had another six psalms followed by a passage from Saint Paul recited by heart and by some prayers. In the shorter summer months the three readings of the first nocturn were replaced by an Old Testament passage recited by heart. Rule of St Benedict, chapters 9‚Äì10 (original Latin text); Doyle translation On Sundays, the monks rose earlier. The first nocturn had four readings instead of three, and the second nocturn also had four readings instead of recitation by heart of a passage of Saint Paul. Then followed a third nocturn, which instead of six psalms had three Old Testament canticles. These were followed by four readings from the New Testament and a reading by the abbot from the Gospels.Rule of St Benedict, chapter 11 (original Latin text); Doyle translation  Roman practice  Within the Carolingian Empire (800‚Äì888), a form of the liturgy of the hours, described by Amalarius, was imposed that can be called the \\"Roman-Benedictine Office\\".Anscar J. Chupungco (editor), Liturgical Time and Space (Liturgical Press 2000), p. 67Stanislaus Campbell, From Breviary to Liturgy of the Hours: The Structural Reform of the Roman Office, 1964-1971 (Liturgical Press 1995), p. 6 In this form, the first nocturn of the Sunday vigil or matins had twelve psalms sung in three groups of four psalms, each group treated as a single psalm with a single doxology at the end. This was followed by three readings, each with a responsory. In each of the other two nocturns the readings and responsories were also three, but each nocturn had only three individual psalms instead of three groups of four.Chapungco (2000), p. 68 The ferial vigil had only one nocturn, composed of six groups of two psalms, followed by three readings with their responsories.Margot E. Fassler, Rebecca A. Baltzer (editors), The Divine Office in the Latin Middle Ages (Oxford University Press 2000), p. 5 On the basis of the practice of the Roman Curia the texts and rubrics of the various books used for the celebration of the liturgy of the hours were combined at the beginning of the thirteenth century into the Breviarium secundum usum Romanae Curiae. A revision of this under Pope Honorius III was adopted by the Franciscans and by them popularized throughout Europe. It introduced many hymns but also led to celebration being spoken rather than sung.Chapungco (2000), pp. 69‚Äì71 It was the main basis of Pope Pius V's Roman Breviary of 1568, the contents of which became much more the private prayer of the clergy than the communal prayer of the Christian people, and the canonical hours became disassociated from particular times of the day.Chapungco (2000), pp. 74‚Äì76 This tendency of viewing the Liturgy of the Hours as edification and spiritual nourishment of individual clergy rather than a form of worship had been strengthened by the publication in 1535, and the widespread printing of the drastically modified breviary of Cardinal Francisco de Qui√±ones, which restored generally the weekly recitation of the whole psalter and the reading of the major part of the Bible in a year, but which provoked a reaction that led to the determination of the Council of Trent to restore a somewhat purified form of the previously existing form of the Liturgy of the Hours. It fell to Pope Pius V to put into effect the Council's desire.Campbell (1995), pp. 12‚Äì14 In the Roman Breviary as arranged by Pope Pius V in 1568, Sunday matins has three nocturns, the first with 12 independent psalms, the second and third with 3 psalms each, and each nocturn has 3 readings. Feasts of double or semidouble rank have 3 nocturns, each with 3 psalms and 3 readings.Rubricae Generales Breviarii, I,5; II,4 On a feast of simple rank, a feria or a vigil day, there is no division into nocturns and the 12 psalms and 3 readings are treated as a single nocturn.Rubricae Generales Breviarii, III,4; V,3; VI,4 In comparison with the post-Vatican II revision, the readings are very brief.For instance, Breviarium Romanum (Dessain 1861) In 1911 Pope Pius X introduced a radical revision of the psalter of the Roman Breviary. He ended many of the previous repetitions of the same psalms day after day. For instance, Psalms 148‚Äì150, which previously were said every day at the end of lauds and which may have given that hour the name of \\"lauds\\",Thomas Merton, Monastic Observances: Initiation into the Monastic Tradition (Liturgical Press 2010), p. 99 were each said only once in the week and no longer together. The longer psalms were divided into portions, which in many cases were assigned to different hours and days. In his completely new arrangement, matins always had nine psalms or portions of psalms, whether distributed in groups of three among three nocturns, each nocturn of which had three readings, or, on liturgically less important days, recited as a single group and followed by only three readings. It was planned to proceed also to a revision of the readings at matins in view of the excessive abbreviation of the scriptural readings and the inclusion of unhistorical content in the accounts of the saints. This revision was not in fact carried out until after the Second Vatican Council, but concrete work on it had already begun under Pope Pius XII.Campbell (1995), pp. 18 and 22‚Äì28 The 1960 Code of Rubrics of Pope John XXIII specified what celebrations had three nocturns: * Feasts of I or II class; * Ferias of the Triduum sacrum; * Octave Day of Christmas; * All Souls' Day.Ordo Divini Officii Recitandi Sacrique PeragendiThe New Rubrics of the Roman Breviary and Missal: Translation and CommentaryDivinum OfficiumCode des Rubriques ‚Äì 1960 The Code of Rubrics removed the multiplicity of nocturns from matins of Sundays, apart from those that were I class feasts (Easter and Pentecost). This required a reduction in the number of readings. The three former scriptural readings were combined into two, and the first part of the homily in the previous third nocturn became the new third reading.Campbell (1995), p. 29  Abolition of nocturns  With his apostolic constitution Laudis canticum of 1 November 1970, Pope Paul VI announced his revision of the Latin-Church Liturgy of the Hours, involving among other things distribution of the psalms over a period of four weeks instead of the previous arrangement whereby they were said within a single week. In line with the decision of the Second Vatican Council that matins, while retaining its character of nocturnal praise should become a prayer for any hour of the day, that canonical hour was renamed the Office of Readings and to it were assigned two substantial readings, one from Scripture, the second from the Fathers of the Church or other writers, and only three psalms or portions of psalms. This contrasted strongly with the arrangement to which the Rule of Saint Benedict gave witness: twelve complete psalms, to which on Sundays three canticles were added. In the Benedictine system, the psalms and the readings were distributed among two or three nocturns. Between Benedict and Paul VI the two-nocturns arrangement had been done away with, and on days when matins was not divided into three nocturns it was spoken of as being of a single \\"nocturn\\". With the reform of Paul VI, the term \\"nocturns\\", whether in the singular or the plural form, ceased to be used.

Originally a village, the growth of both the village and the city has meant Douglas has become incorporated into the city over time. The 2017 Mackinnon Report proposed that Douglas and surrounding residential areas be moved to within an extended Cork city boundary, ending the division of Douglas between the city and county administrative areas. This was approved by the Cabinet on 6 June 2018, with Douglas and surrounding areas Rochestown, Grange and Frankfield to move into the city council area following the 2019 local elections. This change occurred on 31 May 2019, ending the divide between the separated halves of Douglas.  History  = Prehistory = There are a number of extant or proposed prehistoric sites in Douglas and the surrounding area, including a shell midden, ringforts, souterrains, and a fulacht fiadh. Further evidence of prehistoric settlement in the area includes the finding of a Bronze Age decorated beaten gold disc in the townland of Castletreasure; although reputed to be related to the ruined castle of the same name, it has actually been dated to 2500-2000 BC. = Origins (13th-17th century) = Douglas was first mentioned in an inquisition on the lands of Gerald de Prendergast in 1251, and in a 1291 taxation document which records the lands as being an appurtenance of the Church of Bauvier. It is alternately listed as \\"Duffelglasse\\" and \\"Duglasse\\" in 1302 and 1306, respectively, as part of the parish of Carrigaline. In the year 1603, it became one of the liberties of Cork City. In 1615, parochial records mention the chapel of Douglas being laid waste, reportedly due to theft of the foundation stones, and in a 1700 entry of the same records it is mentioned that the ruined chapel in question had been the church of the Carrigaline parish for a century prior to the construction of a new church in Carrigaline. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms. = Linen industry (18th-19th century) = The area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of the \\"Douglas factory\\" in 1726, reported in August 1755 to be the property of \\"Messrs. Perry, Carleton and Co.\\", with 100 looms initially operational. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the Royal Navy, amongst other clients. The industry was established by Huguenot weavers and textile workers, such as the Besnards, who acquired the Mills by 1783 and in 1801 installed the first powered spindles in Ireland, along with skilled workers from Ulster and Scotland. In addition to the mill workers, employees included over 1,000 spinners working from their houses, and hacklers, bleachers and labourers tasked with preparing raw material in Douglas village. Terrace built for mill workers, Grange Road Further textile mills opened in the nineteenth century, including an additional Besnard-owned scutching mill (Ravensdale, 1806), Lane‚Äôs Corn and Hemp Mills (now Douglas Community Park, 1845), O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs Brothers (St Patrick‚Äôs Woollen Mills, 1882), Donnybrook Mills (Wallis & Pollock Flax Mills, 1866; re-opened as Morroghs' Woolen Mills, 1889/1890) and Conroy‚Äôs Rope and Twine Mills (now Galway's Lane, 1892). Most of the mills ceased to operate in the early twentieth century, although St. Patrick's Woollen Mills and Donnybrook Mills continued to operate until the 1970s. Some of the houses built for the mill workers are still in existence, including a terrace of houses near the junction of the Grange Road and Donnybrook Hill. Other large businesses of the time included an Osiery beside Conroy's Mills, two large brick manufacturers which straddled the nearby estuary, the Ravensdale Flour Mill, and the Woodville Flour Mill which was situated south of the Rochestown train station and produced sea biscuits and ship bread. Douglas developed as a suburban area throughout the later eighteenth century and the nineteenth century, and was noted for the high concentration of 'big houses'. The popularity of the area among the nobility was such that elevated prices were commanded for the surrounding lands, and as a result, the acreage of the estates was lower than average. The oldest house was believed to have been Ronayne's Court, built in 1627 by Morris Ronayne; although the house was demolished in 1969, the original inscribed fireplace was moved to Blackrock Castle. The nearby Montfieldstown House was reputed to be the inspiration for Havisham House of Dickens' Great Expectations, having been abandoned following a ruined wedding. Bloomfield House was connected to a notorious libel case between the prominent Cork Pike and Beamish families, in which the judge, who ruled in favour of Pike in Pike v Beamish, was given the house upon announcement of the verdict by the mother of the plaintiff. Windsor House was occupied by Lord Bandon, Sir Abraham Sutton and the Kiltegan Fathers, before being redeveloped as the Rochestown Park Hotel. Ballybrack House was occupied by the Lane family, also of Vernon Mount, and is the birthplace of art dealer Sir Hugh Lane. It received frequent visits from Lady Gregory, a close relation of the family. High Court, built in 1720 and later known as Westgrove, was the birthplace of playwright and Abbey director Lennox Robinson. Grange House was home of the Conron family, descended from Sir Christopher Hatton, for over 300 years. Douglas Hall, one of the few remaining examples of a slate-fronted house in Ireland, was home to Rev. Dr. Francis Moylan, Bishop of Cork, who was made a freeman for his rhetorical opposition to the French invasion at Bantry Bay during the 1798 Rebellion. Vernon Mount, which was built for a wealthy merchant family in the late 18th century, was occupied by Sir Henry Browne Hayes, who was sentenced to penal servitude in Botany Bay after attempting to abduct an heiress for forced marriage. Other prominent Big Houses included Ravenscourt House, Old Court, Norwood Court, Ballybrack House, Donnybrook House, Montpelier House, Grange Erin, Castletreasure House, Bellvue House, Tramore House (home of the philanthropic Reeves family), and Maryborough House (now the Maryborough House Hotel, with an earlier late-17th century lodge). Douglas was made a separate Roman Catholic parish sometime before 1768. St. Columba‚Äôs (Roman Catholic) church was built in 1814 by the Rev. Thomas Barry, according to local legend using the stones of the ruined castle of Castletreasure. A Douglas \\"Chapel of Ease\\" to the Church of Ireland parish of Carrigaline was established on 17 September 1786, with the establishment of a full separate parish in February 1875. In 1855, the Protestant population of the parish was reported as having been 310, with 150 children attending the parish school. The 1785 church was rebuilt and reconsecrated on 27 August 1875 as St. Luke‚Äôs church, however, following the death of the resident Canon in 1886, as well as the principal architect, the church remained without a spire until 1889, with the church bell and tower clock donated by Mary Reeves of Tramore House, with the stipulation that the clock face towards her front door. Notable parishioners interred at St. Luke's include the poet Richard Alfred Milliken and librarian Richard Caulfield; in addition, a plaque was erected in the memory of art collector Sir Hugh Lane, deceased in the sinking of the Lusitania. The nearby parish of St. Finbar's opened a chapel of ease in Frankfield in 1838, later known as the Holy Trinity, on ground donated by Samuel Lane. An additional graveyard, located on Carr's Hill, was opened in 1848 on land donated by the Master of the Workhouse, George Carr, to deal with the increase in deaths from the Great Famine. In 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company built a route from Cork City to Douglas. This operated until 1932 when it was replaced by a bus service. = Later developments (20th-21st century) = In the second half of the twentieth century, Douglas underwent major changes as it became a suburb of Cork. New housing was built and the area between Douglas and Cork City became built-up. Schools, shopping centres and other amenities developed to serve this new population. Douglas Community School was built in 1968, and the original Douglas Shopping Centre was completed in 1972. This shopping centre underwent a significant redevelopment at the turn of the 21st century (although, as of 2020, is closed following a fire). A second shopping centre, Douglas Court Shopping Centre, was built in the late 1980s and a 5-screen multiplex cinema (since demolished) was also built. Several hotels, including the Rochestown Park Hotel and Maryborough House Hotel were also developed. Douglas has two golf facilities, Douglas Golf Club at Maryborough Hill and a driving range at Frankfield Golf Club. Following the release of the MacKinnon Report in 2017, covering a possible extension of Cork city's boundary, it was proposed that the Douglas area (including Douglas, Frankfield, Grange and Donnybrook) would be moved to the administrative area of Cork City Council. This, if implemented, would move all of Douglas to the city, ending the divide of the town between the city and county. The boundary change (incorporating parts of Ballincollig, Douglas, Glanmire, and Rochestown within the city boundary) occurred in late May 2019.  Residential areas  Donnybrook Hill From the late 19th and into the 20th century, there was an expansion of residential areas in the Douglas catchment. Housing developments (mostly private, with some social housing) were built in Grange, Frankfield, Donnybrook, Maryborough, Rochestown, Mount Oval and along the two main roads connecting Douglas to the city centre, the Douglas Road and the South Douglas Road. Donnybrook, for example, is South of Douglas village, and has a Centra outlet, snooker club, football club (College Corinthians) and forested walkway (at Ballybrack Woods) serve as amenities for the residential developments in the Donnybrook Hill area. Grange and Frankfield (encompassed by Frankfield/Grange parish) lie to the West of Douglas village, and are mainly residential areas served by retail outlets (including SuperValu and Aldi), schools (like Scoil Nioclais primary school) and other services (including an office of Douglas credit union). The residential development at Mount Oval has a bar, Spar, and a pharmacy.  Amenities  Stream near Douglas Community Park Amenities and green-spaces in the area include Douglas Community Park (a 5-acre park close to the centre of Douglas which includes a playground), and Ballybrack Woods (a wooded area south of Douglas village which is known locally as 'Mangala'). There have been calls to build a pedestrian and cycle trail through the woods around Vernon Mount, carried by an overbridge across the South Ring Road to Tramore Valley Park.  Shopping and business  The village centre of Douglas has two principal commercial streets, East Douglas Street and West Douglas Street, which are situated approximately 300m apart. Retail activity is also centred around two shopping centres, Douglas Court Shopping Centre and Douglas Village Shopping Centre. \\"Douglas Court\\" (anchored by Dunnes Stores) was built in the early-1990s, and \\"Douglas Village\\" (anchored by Tesco, Marks and Spencer and TK Maxx) was originally developed in the mid-1970s and was the second shopping centre ever built in Ireland. Douglas was formerly the site of the headquarters of Cork and Limerick Savings Bank. However, this bank was merged into Trustee Savings Bank in 1992. The former headquarters was initially still used for regional administration, but this function was transferred to a new building in Cork Airport Business Park. A farmers market is held every Saturday morning outside the Douglas Village Shopping Centre entrance.  Demographics  In the 2011 census, the percentage of Irish nationals living in Douglas was 88.8%. UK nationals accounted for 1.7%; Polish nationals 3.2%; Lithuanians 0.6%; Other EU nationals 2.1%; Other nationals 2.9%; 0.7% did not state their nationality. In the 2016 census, 78.6% of residents of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, 8% were members of other religions, 12% had no religion and less than 1% did not state a religion. In the same census, 86.2% of electoral division residents identified as white Irish, 8.3% were other whites, 1% were black, 1.7% Asian or Asian Irish, 1.4% were of other ethnicities, and 1% did not state an ethnicity.  Sport  =GAA= Nemo Rangers GAA club GAA clubs in the area include the Douglas GAA and Nemo Rangers hurling and football clubs. Nemo Rangers were historically associated with Turners Cross, but moved to a new location in the Trabeg area of Douglas in the 1990s. In the 2004, 2007 and 2012 u10 Community Games, Douglas won the Cork Community Games, the Munster Community Games and the all-Ireland Community Games. =Association football= Local association football (soccer) clubs include Tramore Athletic F.C., Grangevale AFC, College Corinthians and Douglas Hall AFC. =Golf= There are also local golf (and pitch and putt) clubs, including Douglas Golf Club, Frankfield Golf Club and Douglas Pitch and Putt Club. =Rugby union= Douglas has representation in rugby union, and Douglas RFC was founded in 1902 as one of the earliest Cork rugby clubs. While this original club drew members from the workforce of St Patrick's Woollen Mills in Douglas (which closed in the 1970s), the club in its current form was founded in 1979. =Other sports= Other sports clubs include tennis (Douglas Tennis Club), basketball (Fr. Mathews Basketball Club), gymnastics (Douglas Gymnastics Club), martial arts (at Elite Fitness Centre), cricket and hockey clubs (Cork Harlequins and Church of Ireland Hockey Club).  Transport  = Road = The N40 passes through Douglas, but it is not possible to turn onto it in an eastbound direction and westbound traffic may not leave the road. Fuller access is available via the N28 from nearby Rochestown. Douglas is served by a number of R-standard roads, including the R609 (which links to the N28 at Maryborough), R610 (Passage West to Cork city centre), R851 (Cork city centre to the N27), and R853 (to Ballinlough). = Bus = Bus services are provided by Bus √âireann, and the routes which pass through Douglas include numbers 206 (Grange to the city centre), 207 (Donnybrook to Ballyvolane), 216 (Mount Oval to Cork University Hospital), 219 (Mahon to Cork Institute of Technology), 220 (Ovens - Grange Manor to Carrigaline and Crosshaven), and 223 (Cork City Centre to Haulbowline). = Rail = The nearest active railway station is Cork Kent railway station, approximately 5 km away. Until 1932, Douglas was served by the Blackpool-Douglas route of the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company. Religious congregations St. Columbas Catholic church, Douglas As of the 2016 census, 78.6% of the population of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, with St. Columbas as the first Catholic parish church in the area, dating to 1814. From the 1960s, with housing developments and population growth in Douglas, overcrowding in St. Columbas prompted a decision to build a new Catholic church in the Grange/Frankfield area. This new church (the Church of the Incarnation) was consecrated in 1976, and was a chapel-of- ease to the Douglas parish before being separating into its own parish in 1982. St. Patrick's Catholic church serves the Rochestown area, and dates to 1991. Other religious congregations serving the Douglas population include St. Lukes (Anglican) church which was consecrated in 1875, the Wesley Chapel (Methodist) church on the Douglas Road, Douglas Baptist congregation (which meets at Douglas Community School), Radical Life (Pentecostal) church, the Holy Trinity (Anglican) church in Frankfield which dates to 1838, and the Inspiration House (RCCG) in Frankfield.

In the British Isles, it is only known to occur in a few locations in the Cuillin Ridge of the Isle of Skye. It inhabits damp gravels and screes, often over limestone. Description The stems grow up to 40 cm (16 inches) tall, and are topped with loose heads of white, four-petalled flowers. The leaves in the basal rosette are long, strongly toothed and clearly stalked, although the stem leaves are stalkless and clasp the stem. Taxonomy Arabis alpina is believed to have originated in Asia Minor about 2 million years ago. From there it migrated twice into East Africa (500,000 years ago) where it grows today on the high East African mountains in the ericaceous belt. Another migration route led A. alpina into Europe which was then colonised periglacially. In genetic terms, the highest diversity is found in Asia Minor. In central and northern Europe, A. alpina seems to be genetically quite uniform. There is growing interest to develop Arabis alpina as a model organism for genetics, population genetics, and molecular biology. The first genetic linkage map has been created and the first phenotypes, especially perenniality, are tackled by QTL mapping. =Subdivision= A former subspecies, A. alpina subsp. caucasica, is now recognised as a separate species, Arabis caucasica.

He was mentor and chief military advisor to King Charles XII of Sweden, and served as deputy commander-in-chief of the Carolean Army, an army he assisted both in its education and development. Rehnski√∂ld grew up in Swedish Pomerania and studied at Lund University under philosopher Samuel von Pufendorf. He entered Swedish war service in 1673 and participated with distinction in the battles of Halmstad, Lund, and Landskrona during the Scanian War, where he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel and Adjutant-General. After the war, he was commander of several regiments, observer and tutor to Duke Frederick IV during the Nine Years' War, and Governor-General of Scania. In the Great Northern War he was Charles XII's right-hand man in the operative organization of the Carolean Army and drafted the battle plans for the landing at Humleb√¶k and for the battles of Narva, D√ºna and Klisz√≥w. In the battle of Fraustadt in 1706, with his own independent army, he decisively defeated a Saxon-Russian Army under the command of Field Marshal Schulenburg. For his services, Rehnski√∂ld was appointed Field Marshal and the title of Count. During Charles XII's campaign against Russia, Rehnski√∂ld was in command during the battle of Holowczyn and the siege of Veprik, where he was severely injured. After Charles XII became incapacitated by a bullet wound, Rehnski√∂ld replaced him as commander-in-chief of the Swedish Army during the battle of Poltava in 1709, where it suffered a decisive defeat. After the battle, Rehnski√∂ld became a prisoner of war in Russia and spent the years in captivity together with Count Carl Piper by running a management office in Moscow to assist the other Swedish prisoners of war. Rehnski√∂ld was exchanged in 1718 and arrived at the siege of Fredriksten just before Charles XII was shot to death. Rehnski√∂ld later served as commander in western Sweden and, suffering from an old shrapnel injury, died in 1722. Childhood and Education (1651‚Äì1676) Castle of Griebenow. Built between 1707 and 1709. Rehnski√∂ld was born on 6 August 1651 in Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. His parents were the government councillor of Pomerania, Gerdt Antoniison Rehnski√∂ld (1610‚àí1658), originally Keffenbrinck, and Birgitta Torskesk√•l (died 1655), niece of Baron Johan Adler Salvius. Keffenbrinck's descendants came from Westphalia, and their seat was the castle of Rehne in the northern part of the M√ºnsterland province. Gerdt Rehnski√∂ld initially served as a scribe in Kammarkollegium, and later as the authorized representative of the Crown at King Gustavus Adolphus' administrative entourage during the King's military campaign in Germany. Thanks to his efforts in the maintenance of the Swedish troops during the Thirty Years War, he became a naturalized Swedish nobleman in 1639 by Queen Kristina and adopted the name Rehnski√∂ld after his family seat. He was also awarded the Griebenow, Willershusen, and Hohenwarth estates in Pomerania, as well as Stens√§ttra farm in S√∂dermanland. In 1640, the Rehnski√∂ld family was introduced in the House of Nobility at number 270.Konow (2001), pp. 14-15Palmgren (1845), p. 48Rosander (2003), p. 262 Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld was the eighth of the Rehnski√∂lds' eleven children. After his father's death in 1658, Carl Gustav had two brothers and two sisters. The government councillor Philip Christoff von der Lancken and the regional councillor Joachim Cuhn von Owstien, both close friends to Gerdt Rehnski√∂ld before his death, received custody over the five siblings. The siblings suffered from financial hardship, partly due to Gerdt's money problems during the latter part of his life, and partly because of inheritance disputes between the five siblings and Gerdt Rehnski√∂ld's third wife and widow Anna Catharina G√§rffelt. The guardians had granted her Birgitta Rehnski√∂ld's family jewelry and 14,000 riksdaler from the heritage. As a result, the siblings complained about their guardians' way of treating them and wrote several letters of complaint to the Swedish government. Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld's brother-in-law Anders Appelman later came to participate more actively in the upbringing of the five siblings, and gave funds to Carl Gustav's and his brothers' continued education. Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld undertook home education and entered Lund University at the age of 20. Here he studied theology, history, language and philosophy. He participated in lectures with historian and philosopher Samuel von Pufendorf, who took notice of the keen student and offered individual lessons under his tutelage. Pufendorf left a lasting impression. Rehnski√∂ld re-wrote Pufendorf's work Einleitung zur Historie der vornehmsten Reichen und Staaten in Europa (printed in Frankfurt only in 1682), provided the manuscript with Pufendorf's personal comments, and kept it for the remainder of his life.Konow (2001), pp. 18‚àí23 Rehnski√∂ld joined the Swedish Army at the age of 22, and in 1673 obtained a commission as Ensign at Captain Reinhold Anrep's company in the N√§rke-V√§rmland Regiment. Already in the following year, he was appointed Lieutenant at the Queen Dowager of the Realm's Horse Life Regiment. In July 1675, he transferred to the Uppland Regiment, and on 12 February 1676 he became an officer of the prestigious Life Guards. Scanian War (1676‚Äì1679) Battle of Lund (1684) by Johann Philip Lemke. Rehnski√∂ld fought with his squadron at Lund, which he later took command of after its commander had been wounded. During the early stages of the Scanian War, Rehnski√∂ld served at sea with a company of the Life Guards. He was then commanded ashore and, during the night between 31 July and 1 August 1676, he carried out his first military operation at Tostebro. Along with parts of his company he conquered a Danish entrenched position after a short battle. When informed of this, King Charles XI made him Captain of the Life Guards, with whom he participated in the battle of Halmstad on 17 August 1676.Konow (2001), pp. 24‚àí27Rosander (2003), p. 262‚àí263 Back in the Horse Life Regiment, this time as ryttm√§stare, Rehnski√∂ld participated in the battle of Lund. After his squadron commander Lindhielm was wounded during the battle, Rehnski√∂ld replaced him and lead his squadron against the enemy. Charles XI was highly impressed by Rehnski√∂ld's bravery, promoting him on the battlefield to Major and transferring him to be Adjutant-General in the General Staff under Erik Dahlbergh's guidance and supervision. When the Swedish Army retreated from R√∂nneberga in May 1677, he alternately commanded the van- and rearguards, participating in numerous skirmishes. His efforts won the praise of Dahlbergh, who called Rehnski√∂ld \\"one of the most promising young officers in the army\\" in the presence of Charles XI. In the battle of Landskrona, Rehnski√∂ld, along with his two companies, was surrounded by Danish elite units, and the Life Regiment's casualties were the highest among the Swedish regiments participating in the battle. On 5 November 1677, Rehnski√∂ld was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel at the age of 26. He took effective command of the Queen Dowager of the Realm's Horse Life Regiment since its commander, General Rutger von Ascheberg, was commanded elsewhere. Rehnski√∂ld became a long-standing friend to von Ascheberg, who was Charles XI's chief military advisor and mentor, and whom Rehnski√∂ld regarded as his teacher in the art of war.Palmgren (1845), p. 49Rosander (2003), p. 263 In the last two years of the war, Rehnski√∂ld served on the Norwegian front in Bohusl√§n and participated in the relief of Bohus Fortress, where his career came close to an abrupt end when he was fired upon by a fortified Norwegian force. At Uddevalla's redoubt, he was the main reason that a Danish relief attempt was repelled. Interlude before the Great Northern War (1679‚Äì1700) In 1679, peace was concluded with Denmark and the Carolean army was demobilized. Rehnski√∂ld's rapid rate of promotion slowed: the rank of Colonel and raising his own regiment had to wait. In peacetime, Rehnski√∂ld was acting Lieutenant-Colonel and Adjutant- General, and learnt much about military logistics which proved to be useful in the future. He remained a dutiful royal servant, being one of the \\"promising young men\\" mentioned by Charles XI in a letter to Dahlbergh in 1682. In 1689 he became Colonel of the German Foot Life Regiment, an enlisted garrison regiment accommodated in Landskrona, Halmstad, Karlskrona, Malm√∂, and Helsingborg. With this position, he was made Commandant of Landskrona Citadel.Konow (2001), pp. 28‚àí31 Charles XI (1691) by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl. During 1690 and 1691 the Dutch Republic negotiated with Sweden for volunteers to fight in the war against France. The Swedish King provided 6,000 men, and Rehnski√∂ld, with the King's blessing, traveled to the Netherlands in the late summer of 1691. For three months he served as a military observer and military tutor to Prince Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp. Rehnski√∂ld reported to Charles XI on King William III and the Grand Alliance's joint operations, and the lack of discipline among the Allied forces. Rehnski√∂ld had to personally intervene in a disciplinary trial between the young Swedish officers Axel Gyllenkrok and Carl Magnus Posse. They volunteered for the French Army and tried to escape to the Allied camp in Flanders, where they were arrested but were released after they protested. Charles XI ordered Rehnski√∂ld to express his stern dissatisfaction to the young officers; through their undisciplined course of action, they had earned the condemnation of the foreign soldiers and, according to the King, they should have acted in accordance with prevalent soldierly manners.Konow (2001), pp. 32‚àí38√Öberg (1998), pp. 29-30 On his return to Sweden in 1693 Rehnski√∂ld received the colonelcy of the Scanian Cavalry Regiment; he was made Major-General of cavalry in 1696. After von Ascheberg's death in April 1693, Rehnski√∂ld came to finish his work of renewing the old allotment system, becoming Charles XI's chief military steward, and was employed in matters of tactics and education. In Herrevad Abbey and Ljungbyhed he organized extensive training activities for his regiment, and worked hard making it well-equipped and combat effective. Under his tutelage, the Scanian Cavalry Regiment became a model regiment in the Swedish cavalry. When Charles XI died in 1697, he was succeeded by his son Charles XII. The new King granted Rehnski√∂ld the title of Baron, appointed him Governor-General of Scania and Lieutenant-General of cavalry.Konow (2001), pp. 39-44, 48Sj√∂str√∂m (2009), p. 91 Rehnski√∂ld was instrumental in the development of Carolean combat tactics, based on the \\"national school\\" which itself derived from the offensive tactics designed by Gustavus Adolphus, Johan Ban√©r and Charles X Gustav. Charles XI was a strong advocate of the national school, which was designed by Rutger von Ascheberg and Erik Dahlbergh. Their disciples, Rehnski√∂ld and Quartermaster General Carl Magnus Stuart, educated Charles XII in this kind of warfare, and when Stuart was appointed Governor-General of Courland in 1701, Rehnski√∂ld became the King's chief military adviser and mentor. Rehnski√∂ld advocated that the infantry should be organized into battalions of 600 men, one-third pikemen and two-thirds musketeers. They would carry out rapid marches with pikes and drawn swords after giving a close-range volley. The cavalry would be divided into companies of 125 men, which would charge in clustered wedge formations at full speed. This tactic was in stark contrast to the continental pattern, which advocated counter-marching during firing and caracole tactics. The Swedish units would come from the same region and thus be able to create strong bonds between the soldiers and officers. Strict discipline and high morale among the troops would be maintained through the Christian religion, and the allegiance sworn to the King and to their regimental colors and standards.Konow (2001), pp. 41, 44-47 As Governor-General, Rehnski√∂ld asserted the Crown's interests in Scania through cultivation of crown land, forest management, and by counteracting a famine before a suspected bad harvest. He completed the province's military allotment and was tasked with setting the kingdom's plan of defense for a coming war with Denmark. Denmark had a tense relationship with the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp to the south, which was allied with Sweden. Rehnski√∂ld advocated that the border provinces of the Swedish Empire would constitute its strongest defense; each province would be defended by its own allotted regiments. The eastern provinces were reinforced with Finnish allotted regiments and over 100 permanent forts, guarded by enlisted garrison regiments. For the kingdom to have a successful defense the Swedish Navy must have dominion over the Baltic Sea, to provide troop transports and maintain supply lines. Since the army was short of dragoon regiments, Rehnski√∂ld implored permission to set up his own regiment through recruitment, and, in 1700, he founded the Life Dragoon Regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel Hugo Johan Hamilton was appointed its second-in-command. Rehnski√∂ld wanted to make it an elite unit fighting at the King's side, and it would consist only of men from mainland Sweden. In Scania, Rehnski√∂ld was the owner of Allerup and Torup farms. He owned the largest collection of oxen in all of Scania; 112 pairs in total.Konow (2001), pp. 51-57Rosander (2003), p. 263‚àí264 He was succeeded as Governor-General by Magnus Stenbock in 1705.Eriksson (2007), p. 167 On January 17, 1697, Rehnski√∂ld married Elisabeth Funck, daughter of the assessor in Bergskollegium Johan Funck. Rehnski√∂ld was thus brother-in-law to Carl Magnus Stuart, who was married to his wife's older sister Margaretha Funck. In 1699, a daughter was born to the couple, who died before she was one year old. Rehnski√∂ld then left Sweden to embark on the Great Northern War, reuniting with his wife on the spring of 1707 in the castle of Altranst√§dt.Konow (2001), pp. 49‚àí50 Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1709) =Campaign in Denmark and the Baltics= King Charles XII of Sweden (1706) by David von Krafft. The Great Northern War began on 12 February 1700. The King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, Augustus II, crossed the D√ºna river with his Saxon troops and besieged the city of Riga in Swedish Livonia. Riga was defended by Governor-General Erik Dahlbergh. Simultaneously, King Frederick IV of Denmark and his Danish troops invaded Holstein-Gottorp and laid siege to T√∂nning on March.Konow (2001), p. 60Rosander (2003), p. 264 Throughout the Swedish Empire the allotted regiments were mobilized and ordered to march to southern Sweden. The standing army consisted of 77,000 men, of which 10,000 were sent to the Norwegian border and 16,000 were gathered in Scania to fight against Denmark.Liljegren (2000), p. 76 Rehnski√∂ld was leader of the army's deployment in Scania, which he later commanded, and was appointed leader of the operational army headquarters, serving directly under the King. The Swedish ministry of foreign affairs, under Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna, advised Charles XII to relieve Livland, but the King chose to first avert the Danish threat, and Rehnski√∂ld passed the King's decision to Oxenstierna.Konow (2001), pp. 58‚àí60 In mid-July 1700, the Swedish Army command decided to land Swedish troops on Zealand. The main landing would be concentrated in K√∏ge Bugt south of Copenhagen under the command of Rehnski√∂ld, while a small unit would land at Humleb√¶k south of Helsing√∏r, acting as a distraction. However, the landing at K√∏ge Bugt was called off. Instead, Rehnski√∂ld and Carl Magnus Stuart planned the landing at Humleb√¶k, which would be carried out with the support of the Swedish battle fleet. The landing took place on 25 July. Rehnski√∂ld commanded the left wing of the Swedish landing forces while the King and Stuart commanded the right wing. The Danish defenders were quickly routed, and the Swedes established a bridgehead on Zealand. This forced Frederick IV to withdraw from the war on 8 August 1700 with the peace of Travendal.Konow (2001), pp. 60‚àí63Rosander (2003), p. 265 Following Denmark's withdrawal from the war, the Swedish Army reassembled in Scania at the end of August to be transported to the Baltic front. Shortly before, Charles XII was informed that Russian troops under Tsar Peter I had besieged the strategically important Swedish outpost of Narva in Estonia. The Swedish Army were shipped from Karlshamn to Pernau in Estonia on early October. Once informed about the Swedish landing, Augustus II ordered his troops to abandon the siege of Riga. With another threat stopped for the time being, Charles XII and Rehnski√∂ld left Pernau on 16 October and arrived at Reval on 25 October. At Wesenberg, east of Reval, Charles XII gathered all available Swedish units, a total of about 11,000 men. On 13 November the Swedish main army broke up and marched towards Narva. Many officers considered this venture too risky, since the Russian siege army was rumoured to number about 80,000 and the Swedish Army lacked supplies and reinforcements. After skirmishes with Russian reconnoitres the Swedes arrived at the outskirts of Narva on 20 November. Through reconnaissance the Swedes learned that the Russians, who were about 30,000 strong, had built a fortification system that stretched in a semicircle between the north and south sides of the city.Laidre (1996), pp. 140‚Äì145Konow (2001), pp. 64‚àí66 Battle of Narva (1870) by Otto August Mankell. Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld. Engraving by Johan Snack based on a painting by David von Krafft. Together with Quartermaster Lieutenant-General Gerdt Ehrenschantz and artillery commander Johan Si√∂blad, Rehnski√∂ld drafted a simple battle plan that was never written on paper. The Swedes would attack with two columns, consisting of both infantry and cavalry, against the central part of the fortification line. Each column would then move to the south and north along the line and roll up the Russian defense so that the Russian Army would be trapped in two pockets against the Narva River. The Swedish artillery would support their advance. Rehnski√∂ld himself took charge of the left column while general Otto Vellingk commanded the right. Rehnski√∂ld's column was split into two groups, one under Major-General Georg Johan Maidel and the other under Colonel Magnus Stenbock.Laidre (1996), pp. 146‚Äì153Konow (2001), pp. 68‚àí69Eriksson (2007), pp. 66‚àí67Rosander (2003), p. 267Hj√§rne (1902), p. 99 In the afternoon of 20 November, the two Swedish columns advanced towards the Russian line. The Swedes, hidden by a heavy snowstorm that blew directly into the eyes of the Russians, breached the fortifications, causing a violent massacre and panic among the Russian troops. After a wild rout the Russian Army chose to surrender, and after negotiations were allowed to withdraw back to Russia. The Russians lost about 9,000 men during the battle, and their entire command was captured, while the Swedish casualties were estimated to be around 1,900 men. Peter I himself was not present at the battle, since he handed over the command of his army to Duke Charles Eug√®ne de Cro√ø, who became a prisoner of war.Laidre (1996), pp. 146‚Äì171Konow (2001), p. 71Eriksson (2007), pp. 67‚àí68 Many European nations were greatly impressed with the Swedish victory and congratulated the King and his army.Laidre (1996), pp. 177‚Äì178 Magnus Stenbock later praised Rehnski√∂ld for his efforts during the battle: =Campaign in Poland= Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld by an unknown artist. The main Swedish army overwintered outside the town of Dorpat and the dilapidated Laiuse Castle. In the spring, the army was reinforced by regiments from the Swedish mainland, raising their numbers to 24,000 men. In June the army broke up and marched south to Riga to attack Augustus II and his combined Saxon-Russian army, which was estimated to 38,000 men. On July 7 the Swedish main army stood outside Riga, and Charles XII and Rehnski√∂ld planned to cross the D√ºna river right next to the city. Augustus II entrenched his troops along the river, but they were uncertain whether the Swedes were going to cross at Koknese or Riga, and decided to split their forces. Rehnski√∂ld drafted the battle plan together with Carl Magnus Stuart and Erik Dahlbergh. Dahlberg was tasked to obtain landing boats near Riga and construct floating batteries, embarked by infantry units that would land on the opposite beach and establish a bridgehead. A floating bridge had been constructed by Dahlbergh to transfer the cavalry across the river and pursue the Saxon troops. The cavalry was commanded by Rehnski√∂ld, while the infantry was commanded by the King accompanied by Lieutenant-General Bernhard von Liewen.Konow (2001), pp. 73‚àí74 On the morning of 9 July, 3,000 Swedish troops rowed towards the opposite beach. The Swedes torched some smaller boats and pushed them out into the river to obstruct the allies' view. However, because of strong currents, the floating bridge was destroyed and its repair was prolonged, forcing Rehnski√∂ld to improvise by transporting parts of his own Life Dragoon Regiment with rafts. The King's infantry established a bridgehead and repelled multiple Saxon attacks. Augustus II called a retreat and lost up to 2,000 men, while the Swedish casualties amounted to 500 men. The crossing was a success but became a strategic failure since the Swedes could not win a decisive victory over the Saxon troops.Konow (2001), pp. 74‚àí75Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 268‚àí273Rosander (2003), p. 269 Battle of Klisz√≥w (1703) by an unknown artist. Having failed to defeat Augustus II in the D√ºna operation, Charles XII decided to carry out a military campaign on Polish territory to defeat Augustus' army, and secure his own back for an attack against Russia. In July 1702, Charles XII and his main army caught up with Augustus II at the village of Klisz√≥w northeast of Krak√≥w. He was eager to attack Augustus II, but on Rehnski√∂ld's advice, waited for reinforcements from Lieutenant-General Carl M√∂rner's division, which arrived on 8 July. At the same time, Augustus waited for the Polish cavalry, which arrived the following day. Together with Lieutenant- Generals Bernhard von Liewen and Jakob Spens, Rehnski√∂ld drafted the battle plan. Augustus had around 24,000 Saxon-Polish troops covered by dense forest and vast swamps on the Nida river. The artillery was stationed at a height between the two wings, while the Saxon center was placed behind the artillery. The Swedish Army consisted of 12,000 troops. The main Swedish force would move parallel to the Saxon front line and perform a flanking maneuver towards the Saxon right wing. The Swedish right wing, led by Rehnski√∂ld, would defend itself against the Saxon frontal assault, led by Field Marshal Adam Heinrich von Steinau, before the Saxon troops had the time to regroup in order to repel the Swedish main force.Konow (2001), pp. 75‚àí78 On the morning of 9 July, the Swedish troops advanced towards the Saxon front line. When the Polish cavalry began to attack the Swedish left wing and threatened to surround the main Swedish force, the Swedes were forced to regroup to face the Polish cavalry and managed to rout the cavalry. By ordering his troops to form squares, Rehnski√∂ld successfully resisted Steinau's frontal attack, whose troops were forced to withdraw. The Swedish main forces advanced into the Saxon camp, took control of the Saxon artillery, and threatened to encircle the Saxon center. Augustus II was forced to withdraw, and lost about 4,000 men, with Swedish losses were estimated at 1,100 men. Among the dead was Rehnski√∂ld's nephew Frans Anton Rehnski√∂ld, who was Captain of the Life Guards, and Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who commanded the Swedish left wing in their attack.Konow (2001), pp. 78‚àí80Hj√§rne (1902), p. 165‚àí166 Charles XII failed to hunt down Augustus II's retreating army and Augustus II's defeat was once again not decisive, as he was able to withdraw and organize new troops. As a result, Charles XII and the main Swedish army operated around Poland to destroy Augustus II's Polish resources and his Saxon division, while also persuading various nobility factions in Poland who opposed Augustus II to depose him as King. In December 1702 Rehnski√∂ld was commissioned with four infantry and nine cavalry regiments, about 10,000 men, operating independently from the Swedish main army. He was tasked with securing the negotiations between the various noble factions in Warsaw, and to collect money and food from the immediate vicinity to supply the Swedish troops besieging the city of Thorn. He established headquarters near Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, while his troops were mostly stationed in different locations in Greater Poland, where he kept a watchful eye towards the nobility factions fighting for Augustus II.Hj√§rne (1902), p. 197 During his debriefings to the royal headquarters, Rehnski√∂ld exchanged command with Major-General Arvid Axel Mardefelt. In April 1703 Rehnski√∂ld was promoted to General of cavalry, elevating his prestige during his negotiations with the Polish nobility factions which included Prince James Louis Sobieski, magnate Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski and Cardinal Micha≈Ç Stefan Radziejowski. In February 1704 the Warsaw Confederation congregated and agreed to depose Augustus II as King of Poland, since he had lost much of his influence in the kingdom. Rehnski√∂ld was given the task of securing their deliberations and preventing the troops of Augustus II from advancing eastwards.Konow (2001), pp. 81‚àí83 =War in Saxony= Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld. Lithograph by Axel Salmson. In the summer of 1705, Rehnski√∂ld received command of an army in Greater Poland, consisting of five infantry, three cavalry and five dragoon regiments: about 10,000 men in total. Rehnski√∂ld was tasked with protecting Charles XII and the Swedish main army's rear against Augustus II and his Saxon main army, who were mobilizing inside the Saxon border. The Saxon forces comprised a total of 25,000 men, reinforced by Russian auxiliaries and commanded by Field Marshal Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg. Rehnski√∂ld marched closer to the Saxon border along the Vistula river and established winter quarters at Posen. In December he was appointed Royal Councillor and Field Marshal by Charles XII, but was not aware of this until he received a letter from the King in August 1706.Konow (2001), pp. 83‚àí84, 88Sj√∂str√∂m (2008), pp. 74‚àí80 Battle of Fraustadt (1706) by an unknown artist. The Swedish troops resumed their movements in mid-January 1706. Through reconnaissance and interrogation of Saxon prisoners and defectors, Rehnski√∂ld found out that the Saxons planned to conduct a twofold attack on his army: from the southwest by Schulenburg and from the northwest by a division led by Augustus II. Rehnski√∂ld moved quickly to attack Schulenburg's army and defeat it before Augustus II could arrive, despite being greatly outnumbered. On January 31, Rehnski√∂ld reached the village of Fraustadt near the Saxon border. Schulenburg's army was already there and occupied a strong position. Its center was formed of about 16,000 Saxon-Russian infantry, supported by 37 artillery pieces, with 4,000 Saxon cavalry units covering its flanks. Rehnski√∂ld had only 9,400 combatants, including 3,700 infantry units and 5,700 cavalry units. Outnumbering the Saxons in the number of cavalry units, he planned a risky pincer movement, comprising a weak center consisting of infantry units and some cavalry squadrons, and two strong cavalry wings, the right-hand one led directly by Rehnski√∂ld. The Swedish center would face the Saxon frontal assault, while the cavalry wings would attack the Saxon flanks with full force, drive them off, and then attack the Saxon center in the rear.Konow (2001), pp. 84‚àí85Sj√∂str√∂m (2008), chap. 8Rosander (2003), p. 269‚àí270 Rehnski√∂ld gave the attack signal at noon on 3 February 1706. The battle of Fraustadt began with the two Swedish wings advancing faster than the center, making the Swedish battle line curved, which Schulenburg perceived as a sign of weakness. The Swedish wings, however, charged the Saxon flanks and drove off their cavalry. The Swedish wings encircled and enclosed the Saxon- Russian center, which soon disintegrated, forcing Schulenburg to retreat. Schulenburg himself managed to escape, but large parts of his army were cut down by the Swedish cavalry and the remnants were surrounded and captured. After two hours of battle, 7,377 men from Schulenburg's army had been killed and between 7,300 and 7,900 were taken prisoner; among these, about 2,000 were wounded. Of Rehnski√∂ld's troops, 400 were killed and 1,000 were wounded. Many of the Saxon prisoners were subsequently employed in the Swedish Army and formed a Bavarian regiment and a French and a Swiss battalion respectively.Sj√∂str√∂m (2008), chap. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 & 15Konow (2001), pp. 85‚àí87Palmgren (1845), p. 51Rosander (2003), p. 271 Rehnski√∂ld's name was later tied to a massacre that was purported to have occurred shortly after the battle. According to testimony from a Lieutenant Joachim Matthi√¶ Lyth and Lieutenant-Colonel Nils Gyllenstierna, Rehnski√∂ld ordered the massacre of up to 500 Russian prisoners of war.Quennerstedt (1903), p. 31 Coat of arms of Count Rehnski√∂ld. The predominant piece of the escutcheon is a running reindeer. Above it, an upright sword surrounded by laurel wreaths, symbolizing the victory at Fraustadt.Konow (2001), p. 88 His order was condemned by Swedish historians such as Eirik Hornborg, Sverker Oredsson, and Peter Englund.Englund (1988), p. 92Konow (2001), pp. 90‚àí93 Other historians such as August Quennerstedt and Gustaf Adlerfelt considered that the massacre did not take place on Rehnski√∂ld's orders, but rather, might have occurred during the desperate situation in the final stages of the battle. Historians Henning Hamilton and Oskar Sj√∂str√∂m questioned even the existence of the massacre. Both considered that the other historians had misinterpreted or confused this event with the Swedish cavalry's pursuit of the broken Saxon-Russian infantry, who suffered enormous casualties.Sj√∂str√∂m (2008), pp. 288‚àí290Konow (2001), pp. 92‚àí94 Likewise, historian Jan von Konow questioned the certainty of Joachim Lyth's testimony. The victory at Fraustadt had a crippling effect in Denmark, Russia and Saxony, and caused shock waves around Europe. In France, the victory was celebrated, and Prussian policy immediately became friendlier to the Swedes.Sj√∂str√∂m (2009), pp. 264‚àí266 In June the same year, Rehnski√∂ld was made Count (in 1719, the count's branch of the Rehnski√∂ld family was introduced at the House of Nobility under number 48). With the main Saxon army defeated, the Swedish Army had the opportunity to move into Saxony and force Augustus II out of the war. In August, Charles XII reunited with Rehnski√∂ld's army. The joint army moved through Imperial Silesia, and by September, the Swedes had successfully occupied Saxony without resistance. The Treaty of Altranst√§dt (1706) was concluded between Sweden and Saxony on 14 September. Under Swedish terms, Augustus II was forced to break all ties with his allies, renounce his claims to the Polish crown, and accept Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski as the new King.Konow (2001), pp. 96‚àí97Sj√∂str√∂m (2009), chap. 16 The Swedish Army stayed for one year in Saxony, seizing substantial taxes from the Saxon estates for its maintenance. During this time, Charles XII's headquarters in Altranst√§dt became a center for festivities and banquets, as well as one of the focal points of European politics. Princes, diplomats and military personnel from all over Western Europe traveled to Altranst√§dt to meet the victorious King and his troops. The renowned English General the Duke of Marlborough, one of the visitors persuaded Charles XII not to interfere in the War of the Spanish Succession, which took place simultaneously with the Great Northern War.Bain (1895), pp. 109‚àí111 Determined, Charles XII mustered his army to go east towards his final opponent, Tsar Peter and Russia.Konow (2001), pp. 97‚àí98 =Campaign in Russia= Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld by David von Krafft. The Swedish Army left Saxony on August 1707 to march east towards Russian territory. The army was largely newly recruited and well-equipped, numbering about 40,000 men. Rehnski√∂ld acted as Field Marshal and stood closest to the King at its high command. Rehnski√∂ld and the army command were unaware of Charles XII's plans for the campaign, which the King kept to himself, but agreed upon a preliminary march towards Russia's capital Moscow, where Peter I had gathered most of his forces. Charles XII ordered the commander of the \\"Army of Courland\\" in the Baltic provinces, General Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt, to join the main army in the march against Moscow. Lewenhaupt and the Army of Courland were also tasked with obtaining supplies and wagons for onward transport to the Swedish main army. Awaiting Lewenhaupt's troops, the main army advanced slowly towards the Russian border. At the end of January 1708, they arrived at Grodno, which was occupied by 9,000 men of Peter I's army. Charles XII and Rehnski√∂ld attacked with 800 cavalry units, and the Russian troops withdrew after a short but fierce battle. Later in the evening, Russian troops sneaked into the city to surprise the Swedes; Rehnski√∂ld ended up in the middle of the attacking troops, but was not recognized because of the dark sky and managed to get to safety. The attack was repelled, and the Russians were forced to retreat. Later in the year, during the crossing of the Vabitj River at the town of Holowczyn in July 1708, the Swedish vanguard encountered a Russian army in fortified positions on the opposite shore. In the battle of Holowczyn, Charles XII commanded the infantry while Rehnski√∂ld commanded the cavalry. The Russian troops under Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev and Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov were pushed back after eight hours of struggle; however the Russian Army managed to escape mostly intact so the battle was not a decisive strategic victory.Konow (2001), pp. 99‚àí100, 103‚àí105From (2007), pp. 50, 77‚àí78, 141‚àí163 Following the battle of Holowczyn, Charles remained for nine weeks in Mogilev and the nearby areas to the east, between the Dnieper and its tributary Sozh, awaiting Lewenhaupt's late arrival. Lewenhaupt's mission was exceptionally complicated, and halfway to the main army he was intercepted by a Russian army under Peter I's personal command. The resulting battle at Lesnaya on 29 September ended in a draw, with both armies suffering heavy losses. In order to prevent the supply train from falling into Russian hands, Lewenhaupt decided to burn the wagons and the bulk of the supplies, continuing his march with half of his troops. On 23 October, Lewenhaupt eventually united with the main army, but only with 6,500 men and without the necessary supplies.Konow (2001), pp. 100‚àí101Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 287‚àí293 Throughout the campaign, Rehnski√∂ld held a fierce rivalry with the Marshal of the Realm, Count Carl Piper, who had accompanied Charles XII as chief of the perambulating chancellery since 1700. The tense relationship between Rehnski√∂ld and Piper dated back to the Swedish Army's march on Saxony. Both men desired the King's favor: as the senior civilian army official Piper sought to persuade the King not to make reckless actions, whilst Rehnski√∂ld, as second-in-command of the army supported the King's offensive plans. The antagonism between the two, in combination with their fiery temperament and pride in their own abilities, made them unable to reason with each other without an intermediary, a role usually filled by Quartermaster General Axel Gyllenkrok. Their relationship would eventually cause discord and division within the Swedish headquarters, as well as hopelessness and anxiety within the army.Konow (2001), pp. 95‚àí96, 113‚àí115 Rehnski√∂ld discussed which road the army would take from Tatarsk with Gyllenkrok. The army suffered from lack of food supplies and had to move to areas where they could resupply. Peter I had adopted scorched earth tactics, rendering the Swedish march against Moscow ever more difficult. During a council of war, Charles, Rehnski√∂ld, Piper and Gyllenkrok concluded that the army would go south to Severia, in the direction of Little Russia. There the Swedes would be able to establish reliable winter quarters and receive supplies and reinforcements through Charles' alliance with Ivan Mazepa, Hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.Konow (2001), pp. 101‚àí102√Öberg (1998), pp. 97-99 The Swedish assault of Veprik 1709 by Ernst Lissner. Upon learning about Mazepa's alliance with Charles XII, Peter I sent an army under Prince Menshikov to conquer and burn down Mazepa's capital Baturyn. The Cossacks who did not support Mazepa chose Ivan Skoropadsky as the new Hetman on 11 November 1708. Thus, Mazepa lost much of his support in the country and brought the Swedes only a few thousand Cossacks, without the great army and the rich food resources he previously promised. During The Great Frost of December 1708 thousands of Swedish and Russian soldiers succumbed to the cold. The Swedish Army set up camp around Gadyat in early December. Near the town was the fortress of Veprik, which was occupied by a Russian garrison of 1,500 men and blocked the Swedish advance. Charles XII decided that Veprik should be conquered. The assault, on January 7, 1709, was led by Rehnski√∂ld. He planned that Swedish cannons would bombard the fortress ramparts, after which three columns of 3,000 men would climb the ramparts from different directions using storm ladders and cut down the Russian defenders. The first assault failed, as the defenders used several methods to slow down and fend off the Swedish columns. During the second assault, Rehnski√∂ld was hit in the chest by a bullet from a falconet, forcing him to hand over command to Major-General Berndt Otto Stackelberg. This assault was also fruitless, but the two sides agreed upon a truce. Since the Russian garrison had used almost all their ammunition, their Commandant chose to surrender. The Swedish losses counted to 1,000 men killed and 600 wounded. Rehnski√∂ld recovered slightly after six weeks, but his shrapnel injury would never be fully healed.From (2007), pp. 251‚àí255Konow (2001), pp. 106‚àí109 The Swedish Army remained in the areas around Veprik until late February. They marched south to a strong position between Dnieper's tributaries Vorskla and Psel, to gain reinforcements from Poland and Mazepa's Cossacks. Rehnski√∂ld was commissioned to stay with nine infantry and cavalry regiments in the areas around Gadyat and Veprik, shielding the main army against attacks from the north. Rehnski√∂ld's troops reunited with the main army in early March and at the southern part of Vorskla, the Swedish Army arrived at the fortified city of Poltava. In order to occupy the Russians and lure them into the field, Charles XII laid siege to Poltava in May 1709. The city was defended by a 4,200-man garrison. Peter I marched to relieve the city with an army of 74,000 Russian regulars and irregulars.Moltusov (2009), p. 93 During a reconnaissance on 17 June, Charles XII was struck by a stray bullet, injuring his foot badly enough that he was unable to stand. News of his injury tempted the Tsar to dare a field battle. Peter I crossed the Vorskla River and constructed a fortified camp north of Poltava. Between the Russian and Swedish troops was a wide-open field, where two woods formed a passage which the Russians defended by building six redoubts across the gap. In addition, Peter I ordered another four redoubts to be built so that the ten redoubts would form a T-shaped barricade, providing flanking fire against a Swedish advance. Despite his injury, Charles XII would not neglect an opportunity to put up a battle against the Tsar, and commanded Rehnski√∂ld to attack.Konow (2001), pp. 110‚àí112, 115‚àí118Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 295‚Äì296 Battle of Poltava The opposing forces at Poltava comprised about 16,000 Swedish soldiers and 40,000 Russian. Rehnski√∂ld replaced the King as commander-in-chief; Lewenhaupt commanded the infantry and Major-General Carl Gustaf Creutz the cavalry. The battle plan was constructed by Rehnski√∂ld in consultation with the King, while Gyllenkrok established the formation plan. The 8,170 strong Swedish infantry was divided into four columns, which would carry out a surprise attack against the Russian redoubts before dawn and bypass them. The 7,800 strong Swedish cavalry would follow the infantry, divided into six columns. After the infantry bypassed the redoubts, they would march to the wide field in front of the Russian field camp, to a position at a ford near the village of Petrovka and northwest of Peter's fortified army, while simultaneously, the Swedish cavalry would drive off the Russian cavalry. From that position, the gathered Swedish Army would march to the right and form itself into battle formation. If the maneuver succeeded, Peter's fortified army would be trapped in their own camp, with the steep river bank behind them and the Swedish Army in front of them, blocking their line of retreat at Petrovka. If they would not accept the Swedes' challenge, they would eventually starve to death. The four infantry columns would be commanded by Major-Generals Axel Sparre, Berndt Otto Stackelberg, Carl Gustaf Roos and Anders Lagercrona. The King accompanied the eastern column on the left wing in a stretcher.Massie (1986), pp. 492‚àí493Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 296‚Äì297Konow (2001), pp. 120‚àí122 Shortly before midnight on 28 June, Rehnski√∂ld ordered his troops to decamp and advance towards the Russian redoubts in the cover of darkness. Disorder arose in some of the columns, with Rehnski√∂ld having a vicious exchange with Lewenhaupt: The Russians discovered the Swedes' presence and sounded the alarm, and the Swedes lost the element of surprise. After a council of war between the King, Rehnski√∂ld and Gyllenkrok, Rehnski√∂ld ordered the infantry columns to regroup and continue the advance. It was already daylight, and the Swedes discovered the entire Russian cavalry stationed behind the redoubts. The cavalry tried to storm the Swedish columns but the Swedish cavalry fended them off; the Russians were forced to retreat and were pursued by the Swedish cavalry. With the field empty, the Swedish infantry marched towards the Russian redoubts, the foremost of which were conquered after a short battle. The attacks against the other redoubts caused large casualties among the columns, especially for Ross‚Äô column, which was forced to retreat to a nearby forest and would later surrender. In the meantime, the other columns passed the remaining redoubts and marched to the open field in front of the Russian field camp, but Rehnski√∂ld had already lost one third of his infantry. At the same time, the Swedish cavalry had chased the Russian cavalry past the field camp and further north. The Russian cavalry were close to being driven off towards a deep sink in the terrain covered by stony wetlands, when Rehnski√∂ld ordered the Swedish cavalry to interrupt the hunt and re-assemble with the infantry.Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 297‚Äì299Konow (2001), pp. 123‚àí126Massie (1986), pp. 494‚àí500 At nine o'clock, the Russian infantry marched out from the fortified camp and formed into battle formation. Prior to the final battle, 4,000 Swedish soldiers gathered in a line against 22,000 Russian soldiers who were set up into two lines. Rehnski√∂ld ordered Lewenhaupt to attack the Russian lines with his infantry, but since the Swedish cavalry did not arrive in time, the Swedish infantry was broken and the remnants routed. The King, Lewenhaupt and most of the cavalry escaped, united with the siege troops and the baggage train, and marched south along the Vorskla River. Rehnski√∂ld, Piper and the survivors from the infantry were captured by the Russians. 6,900 Swedes were killed or wounded in the battle, and 2,800 were captured. The Russians lost 1,345 men with 3,290 wounded.Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 302‚Äì303Massie (1986), pp. 501‚àí506 A couple of days after the battle, Lewenhaupt and the 20,000 soldiers and non-combatants remaining from the Carolean Army, surrendered to Prince Menshikov at the village of Perevolochna at the ford of the Dnieper. The King, Mazepa and about 1,000 men managed to cross the river and headed to the Ottoman Empire, where Charles stayed for several years before returning to Sweden at the end of 1715. With the main Swedish army destroyed, both Denmark-Norway and Saxony-Poland returned to the war against Sweden. Hannover and Prussia also joined the alliance against Sweden, and together with Russia, the countries attacked the Swedish dominions around the Baltic Sea. The battle of Poltava and the subsequent surrender marked the beginning of Sweden's final defeat in the war.Ericson Wolke (2003), pp. 303‚Äì304Konow (2001), pp. 127‚àí131Massie (1986), pp. 508‚àí524 Rehnski√∂ld's failure as commander during the battle has been a subject of debate among historians. They stated that Rehnski√∂ld was in mental imbalance, as evidenced by his scolding of Lewenhaupt, his second-in-command. Psychologically, Rehnski√∂ld's task as commander-in-chief was stressful and almost impossible due to the King's presence and oversight. von Konow raises two major mistakes Rehnski√∂ld made during the battle. The first was that he organized no reconnaissance of the Russian redoubts that were built the night before the battle and had not informed his subordinates about his plan of attack, causing great confusion in the Swedish high command. The second was his decision to stop the Swedish cavalry's pursuit of the retreating Russian cavalry, which was close to being driven against steep gorges north of the battlefield. Historians have speculated about the reason for this order. Opinions have differed from approval, since Rehnski√∂ld would not take the risk of losing contact with his cavalry during the battle's decisive point, and strongly condemning, because the elimination of the Russian cavalry could have determined the entire battle in favor of the Swedes.Konow (2001), pp. 126‚àí127, 131‚àí133  Prisoner of war (1709‚Äì1718)  Tsar Peter the Great (1830) by Paul Delaroche. Shortly after the battle, Rehnski√∂ld and the other captive Swedish officers were brought to the Russian camp. Rehnski√∂ld, Piper and four Swedish generals were taken to Menshikov's tent, where they surrendered their swords to the Tsar. Peter I asked Rehnski√∂ld about the King's health, since the Russians believed he was among the dead, and Rehnski√∂ld replied that he believed the King was alive and well. Pleased with his reply, Peter returned him his sword. Later the Tsar ordered a banquet with the captured Swedish generals, asking several questions of Rehnski√∂ld and the other generals, and proposing a toast to his Swedish \\"teachers in the art of war\\".Massie (1986), pp. 506‚àí507Konow (2001), p. 134 During late autumn 1709, Rehnski√∂ld and the captured Swedish army were transported to Moscow, where Peter I arranged a massive victory parade on 22 December. The prisoners of war were arranged in ranks, with Rehnski√∂ld and Piper walking among the last. After the parade, the Swedish prisoners were distributed to cities and prison camps around Russia. Rehnski√∂ld and Piper moved into Avram Lopuchin's house in Moscow. During a dinner Rehnski√∂ld had an argument with Piper and Lewenhaupt, where Piper criticized Rehnski√∂ld's leadership during the battle of Poltava and blamed him for the loss. Piper's insults provoked Rehnski√∂ld to the point of violence. Lewenhaupt and Gyllenkrok separated them, and Rehnski√∂ld began accusing Lewenhaupt and the other officers for expressing criticism towards Charles XII: Count Carl Piper by David Kock. A few days later Lewenhaupt proposed, first to Piper and later to Rehnski√∂ld, that they should reconcile so that their hostile relationship would not affect the other Swedish officers. In the presence of Swedish generals and colonels, Rehnski√∂ld and Piper settled their differences. Both remained in Moscow and established a collaboration to help the Swedish prisoners of war and satisfy their interests. With the approval of the Russian authorities they established a management office in the city, through which all contact with the Swedish authorities was routed. They worked hard to raise money for the Swedish prisoners through funds sent from the State Treasury in Stockholm; however, over the years these transfers became increasingly sporadic.Konow (2001), pp. 135‚àí137Norrhem (2010), pp. 133‚àí139√Öberg (1999), pp. 141‚àí144 Due to the lack of support from the Swedish authorities for their captured countrymen, Rehnski√∂ld and the Swedish officers were forced to request allowances from the Tsar in 1714. However, the Tsar decided to exacerbate the conditions of subsistence for the Swedish officers as a punishment for Rehnski√∂ld's and Piper's earlier inflexibility before the Senate in Saint Petersburg, where threats of reprisals were required to compel them to sign the exchange act between the Swedish Commandant Nils Stromberg and the Russian General Adam Veyde, a matter in which they had no authority. The Tsar's resentment over reports of the treatment of Russian prisoners of war in Sweden was a contributing factor to this decision. Piper was imprisoned in Shlisselburg Fortress, where he fell ill and died in 1716.Norrhem (2010), pp. 175‚àí176 Rehnski√∂ld was forced to take care of the management office by himself. He wrote letters of complaint to the Swedish authorities regarding the misery of the Swedish prisoners around Russia. With the rapid spread of pietism among the prisoners Rehnski√∂ld formed an ecclesiastical board in Moscow, from which captive chaplains were sent out to the Swedish prison camps. Rehnski√∂ld himself decided the biblical texts for the four set days for intercession.Konow (2001), pp. 137‚àí138 After a long time without any effort from the Swedish side, the matter of getting Rehnski√∂ld exchanged from captivity was raised in the spring of 1718, when Russia commenced peace negotiations with Sweden in L√∂v√∂ village on V√•rd√∂ in the √Öland Islands. Rehnski√∂ld came to be involved in the matter of succession in Sweden on the initiative of Georg Heinrich von G√∂rtz from Holstein-Gottorp, who had served as Swedish \\"grand-vizier\\" since 1716 and was responsible for the peace talks. Charles XII had no heirs, so G√∂rtz wanted Rehnski√∂ld on his side to strengthen his own position in the Holstein Party, in which G√∂rtz held great influence. G√∂rtz and his party wanted to make Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp heir to the Swedish throne, in order to counteract the pressure from the Hessian party, whose choice for heir to the throne was landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, Prince consort to Charles XII's sister Princess Ulrika Eleonora. After pressure from the Swedish side, Peter I gave the order on 17 September to send Rehnski√∂ld to L√∂v√∂, where he would be exchanged with Major-General Ivan Trubetskoy and Count Avtonom Golovin. Rehnski√∂ld arrived at Lov√∂ on 14 October, where he entrusted G√∂rtz's secretary, Andreas Stambke, to convince Charles Frederick to marry a daughter to Peter I in order to bolster relations between Sweden and Russia. On 30 October the exchange was finalized and Rehnski√∂ld was finally released.Konow (2001), pp. 140‚àí141 The last years (1718‚Äì1722) King Frederick I of Sweden (1730) by Martin van Meytens. Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld by Johan Starbus. Immediately after his release, Rehnski√∂ld went to Stockholm and met with G√∂rtz. Later, Rehnski√∂ld went to Charles XII's headquarters in Tistedalen in Norway, where the King commenced his second Norwegian campaign by laying siege to the fortress of Fredriksten. Rehnski√∂ld arrived at the end of November 1718, and the reunion with the King was claimed as \\"one of his last joys in life\\".Hatton (1985), p. 560 Both had a long conversation on 28 November, regarding the current operational situation in Norway and the peace talks with Russia, about which Rehnski√∂ld obtained fresh information. Two days later, on the evening of 30 November, Charles was shot by a projectile and immediately killed. The King's sudden death forced Prince Frederick, appointed Generalissimo of the army, to call for a council of war, where the Swedes decided that the army must abandon the siege and return to Sweden. The report on the death of Charles XII was signed by Rehnski√∂ld and Field Marshal Carl M√∂rner and sent to the Privy Council in Stockholm. Furthermore, Frederick ordered the arrest of G√∂rtz on 2 December, since the Hessian party sought to seize the upper hand in the matter of succession, which they gained with the death of Charles XII. G√∂rtz was taken to Stockholm, where he was sentenced to death at the Svea Court of Appeal and beheaded on 19 February 1719. With G√∂rtz's death, the negotiations with Russia were discontinued and the war went on for another three years.Konow (2001), pp. 141‚àí144Rosander (2003), p. 273 Another council of war took place in Str√∂mstad on 14 January 1719. The reason for this was that a considerable sum of 100,000 riksdaler arrived from the war commissioner, and Prince Frederick wanted to distribute the money to the high command of the army, in order to win influential votes in the matter of succession. Rehnski√∂ld himself received 12,000 riksdaler, which he saw as a recognition for his time in Russian captivity. Rehnski√∂ld later entered the Privy Council in Stockholm. When the soldiers carrying the King's body arrived in Stockholm on 27 January, they were received by the council members Rehnski√∂ld, Arvid Horn and Gustaf Cronhielm. On 26 February Charles XII was buried in the Riddarholm Church; Rehnski√∂ld carried the royal spire during a long procession from Karlberg Palace to Riddarholmen.Konow (2001), pp. 144‚àí145Wetterberg (2006), p. 279 Due to the kingdom's critical state of weakness, Rehnski√∂ld was appointed commander in western Sweden to protect these regions from Danish attacks. Rehnski√∂ld travelled between Uddevalla and Gothenburg for inspection, strengthening the defenses in the cities and fortresses in Bohusl√§n and Scania. On 10 July, Danish forces landed at Str√∂mstad, and a Danish-Norwegian main army of 30,000 men crossed the border at Svinesund and advanced south without resistance. Shortly after, Str√∂mstad was taken and Frederick IV set up his headquarters there. In Bohusl√§n, Rehnski√∂ld had 5,000 men at his disposal and ordered them to burn down supply depots to prevent them from falling into Danish hands. He gathered his troops and fortified his position in Uddevalla, with the intent to defend the road connections towards V√§nersborg and Dalsland. Rehnski√∂ld later learned about Commandant Henrich Danckwardt's surrender of Carlsten Fortress and decided to stay in Uddevalla despite the threat of being cut off by Danish forces, who could be landed north of Gothenburg. The Danish-Norwegian army in Str√∂mstad, however, returned to Norway at the end of August. Rehnski√∂ld proceeded to Scania and defended it from an invasion threat. On 28 October 1719, an armistice was agreed with Denmark, and a peace treaty was signed in Frederiksborg on 3 July 1720.Konow (2001), pp. 145‚àí146Kuylenstierna (1899), pp. 38‚àí40, 58‚àí59Wetterberg (2006), p. 317 { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Promotions * Ensign: 2 December 1673 * Lieutenant: 26 July 1675 * Captain: August 1676 * Ryttm√§stare: 24 August 1676 * Major: December 1676 * Adjutant-General: December 1676 * Lieutenant-Colonel: 5 November 1677 * Colonel: 26 June 1689 * Major-General of cavalry: 27 July 1696 * Lieutenant-General of cavalry: 4 July 1698 * General of cavalry: 14 April 1703 * Field Marshal: 27 December 1705 (effective August 1706) } On 30 August 1721, following pressure from the Russians, the war was finally concluded by the Treaty of Nystad between Sweden and Russia. The Russians raided the east coast of Sweden since 1719. After the peace, Sweden ceased to be a major power in Europe. When Ulrika Eleonora was appointed Sweden's ruling queen in 1719, she wanted her husband Frederick to become her co-ruler, but this was rejected by the Riksdag of the Estates. In 1720 she decided to step down as ruling queen, and on 24 March 1720, Frederick was appointed King. He was crowned Frederick I on 3 May in Stockholm, and as the oldest member of the Privy Council, Rehnski√∂ld assisted archbishop Mattias Steuchius in placing the crown upon Frederick's head. Rehnski√∂ld participated in the Riksdag meetings between 1719 and 1720, including Council assemblies, but made no further public appearances. In January 1722, Frederick I summoned Rehnski√∂ld to Kungs√∂r. Rehnski√∂ld fell ill during the journey and was taken to L√§ggesta Inn outside of Mariefred. Having high fever and spitting blood, his declining health indicated that he was suffering from his old shrapnel injury from Veprik. He died on 29 January the same year, and with his death, both the noble and the count's branch of the Rehnski√∂ld family was extinguished. The funeral took place on 15 March at Storkyrkan in Stockholm.√Östrand (1999), p. 155 The officiant was Chaplain J√∂ran Nordberg, who had followed Rehnski√∂ld and the army from 1703 to 1715.Konow (2001), pp. 146‚àí147Palmgren (1845), p. 57Rosander (2003), p. 274 Rehnski√∂ld's widow, Elisabeth, married Imperial Count Erasmus Ernst Fredrik von K√ºssow in 1724, and died on 23 November 1726.

Tlatelolco. The practice of human sacrifice in Pre-Columbian cultures, in particular Mesoamerican and South American cultures, is well documented both in the archaeological records and in written sources. The exact ideologies behind child sacrifice in different pre-Columbian cultures are unknown but it is often thought to have been performed in order to placate certain gods. Mesoamerica =Olmec Culture= its sides show bas-reliefs of humans holding quite lively were-jaguar babies. Although there is no incontrovertible evidence of child sacrifice in the Olmec civilization, full skeletons of newborn or unborn infants, as well as dismembered femurs and skulls, have been found at the El Manat√≠ sacrificial bog. These bones are associated with sacrificial offerings, particularly wooden busts. It is not known yet how the infants met their deaths.Ort√≠z C., Ponciano; Rodr√≠guez, Mar√≠a del Carmen (1999) \\"Olmec Ritual Behavior at El Manat√≠: A Sacred Space\\" in Social Patterns in Pre-Classic Mesoamerica, eds. Grove, D. C.; Joyce, R. A., Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, Washington, D.C., p. 225 - 254 (specifically p. 249). Some researchers have also associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp \\"were-jaguar\\" babies, most famously in La Venta's Altar 5 (to the right) or Las Limas figure. Definitive answers await further findings. =Maya culture= In 2005 a mass grave of one- to two-year-old sacrificed children was found in the Maya region of Comalcalco. The sacrifices were apparently performed for consecration purposes when building temples at the Comalcalco acropolis. There are also skulls suggestive of child sacrifice dating to the Maya periods. Mayanists believe that, like the Aztecs, the Maya performed child sacrifice in specific circumstances. For example, infant sacrifice would occur to satisfy supernatural beings who would have eaten the souls of more powerful people. In the Classic period some Maya art that depict the extraction of children's hearts during the ascension to the throne of the new kings, or at the beginnings of the Maya calendar have been studied. In one of these cases, Stela 11 in Piedras Negras, Guatemala, a sacrificed boy can be seen. Other scenes of sacrificed boys are visible on painted jars. =Teotihuacan culture= There is evidence of child sacrifice in Teotihuacano culture. As early as 1906, Leopoldo Batres uncovered burials of children at the four corners of the Pyramid of the Sun. Archaeologists have found newborn skeletons associated with altars, leading some to suspect \\"deliberate death by infant sacrifice\\".Serrano Sanchez, Carlos (1993) \\"Funerary Practices and Human Sacrifice in Teotihuacan Burials\\" \\" Kathleen Berrin, Esther Pasztory, eds., Teotihuacan, Art from the City of the Gods, Thames and Hudson, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, , p. 113-114. =Toltec culture= In 2007, archaeologists announced that they had analyzed the remains of 24 children, aged 5 to 15, found buried together with a figurine of Tlaloc. The children, found near the ancient ruins of the Toltec capital of Tula, had been decapitated. The remains have been dated to AD 950 to 1150. \\"To try and explain why there are 24 bodies grouped in the same place, well, the only way is to think that there was a human sacrifice\\", archaeologist Luis Gamboa said. =Aztec culture= Tl√°loc, as shown in the late 16th century Codex Rios.Aztec religion is one of the most widely documented pre-Hispanic cultures. Diego Dur√°n in the Book of the Gods and Rites wrote about the religious practices devoted to the water gods, Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue, and a very important part of their annual ritual included the sacrifice of infants and young children. According to Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, the Aztecs believed that, if sacrifices were not given to Tlaloc, the rain would not come and their crops would not grow. Archaeologists have found the remains of 42 children sacrificed to Tlaloc (and a few to Ehec√°tl Quetzalc√≥atl) in the offerings of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. In every case, the 42 children, mostly males aged around six, were suffering from serious cavities, abscesses or bone infections that would have been painful enough to make them cry continually. Tlaloc required the tears of the young so their tears would wet the earth. As a result, if children did not cry, the priests would sometimes tear off the children's nails before the ritual sacrifice. Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilxochitl, an Aztec descendant and the author of the Codex Ixtlilxochitl, claimed that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. These high figures have not been confirmed by historians. Hern√°n Cort√©s describes an event in his Letters: In Xochimilco, the remains of a three-to- four-year-old boy were found. The skull was broken and the bones had an orange/yellowish cast, a vitreous texture, and porous and compacted tissue. Aztecs have been known to boil down remains of some sacrificed victims to remove the flesh and place the skull in the tzompantli. Archaeologists concluded that the skull was boiled and that it cracked due to the ebullition of the brain mass. Photographs of the skull have been published in specialized journals. In History of the Things of New Spain Sahag√∫n confesses he was aghast by the fact that, during the first month of the year, the child sacrifices were approved by their own parents, who also ate their children.Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, Historia General de las Cosas de la Nueva Espa√±a, ed. a cargo de √Ångel Ma. Garibay (M√©xico: Editorial Porr√∫a, 2006). p. 97 In the month Atlacacauallo of the Aztec calendar (from February 2 to February 21 of the Gregorian Calendar) children and captives were sacrificed to the water deities, Tl√°loc, Chalchitlicue, and Eh√©catl. In the month Tozoztontli (from March 14 to April 2) children were sacrificed to Coatlicue, Tlaloc, Chalchitlicue, Tona. In the month Hueytozoztli (from April 3 to April 22) a maid; a boy and a girl were sacrificed to Cint√©otl, Chicomecac√≥atl, Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl. In the month Tepeilhuitl (from September 30 to October 19) children and two noble women were sacrificed by extraction of the heart and flaying; ritual cannibalism in honor of Tl√°loc-Napatecuhtli, Matlalcueye, Xochit√©catl, May√°huel, Miln√°huatl, Napatecuhtli, Chicomec√≥atl, Xochiqu√©tzal. In the month Atemoztli (from November 29 to December 18) children and slaves were sacrificed by decapitation in honor to the Tlaloques. South America Archaeologists have uncovered physical evidence of child sacrifice at several pre-Columbian cultures in South America. In an early example, the Moche of Northern Peru sacrificed teenagers en masse, as archaeologist Steve Bourget found when he uncovered the bones of 42 male adolescents in 1995. Male figurine for Capa Cocha rituals, Inka, 1450-1540 CE, gold, Dumbarton Oaks Museum, Washington, DC. =Chim√∫ culture= The Chim√∫ who occupied northern Peru before the Incas, and who were ultimately conquered by the Incas a few decades before the Spanish arrival, carried out what has been claimed as the largest single example of mass child sacrifice at Huanchaco, where their chief city of Chan Chan was located. Researchers have identified at least 227 individuals as sacrificial victims, and it is believed that this mass sacrifice may have been carried out to appease deities who were supposedly bringing extreme rainfall weather conditions upon the Chim√∫. =Inca culture= The maiden. Llullaillaco mummies in Salta province (Argentina). Qhapaq hucha was the Inca practice of human sacrifice, mainly using children. The Incas performed child sacrifices during or after important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca (emperor) or during a famine. Children were selected as sacrificial victims as they were considered to be the purest of beings. These children were also physically perfect and healthy, because they were the best the people could present to their gods. The victims may be as young as 6 and as old as 15. Months or even years before the sacrifice pilgrimage, the children were fattened up. Their diets were those of the elite, consisting of maize and animal proteins. They were dressed in fine clothing and jewelry and escorted to Cusco to meet the emperor where a feast was held in their honor. More than 100 precious ornaments were found to be buried with these children in the burial site. The Incan high priests took the children to high mountaintops for sacrifice. As the journey was extremely long and arduous, especially so for the younger, coca leaves were fed to them to aid them in their breathing so as to allow them to reach the burial site alive. Upon reaching the burial site, the children were given an intoxicating drink to minimize pain, fear, and resistance. They were then killed either by strangulation, a blow to the head, or by leaving them to lose consciousness in the extreme cold and die of exposure. Early colonial Spanish missionaries wrote about this practice but only recently have archaeologists such as Johan Reinhard begun to find the bodies of these victims on Andean mountaintops, naturally mummified due to the freezing temperatures and dry windy mountain air. Inca mummies In 1995, the body of an almost entirely frozen young Inca girl (age 15), later named Mummy Juanita, was discovered on Mount Ampato. Two more ice-preserved mummies, one girl (age 6) and one boy (age 8), were discovered nearby a short while later. All showed signs of alcohol and coca leaves in their system, making them fall asleep, only to be frozen to death. The boy was the only one who showed signs of resistance, due to his hands and feet being tied up. It is also speculated that he might have died from suffocation, as vomit and blood were found on his clothing. In 1999, near Llullaillaco's 6739 meter summit, an Argentine-Peruvian expedition found the perfectly preserved bodies of three Inca children, sacrificed approximately 500 years earlier,Secretar√≠a de Cultura de Salta Argentina ‚Äì MISSION AND ORIGINS . Maam.culturasalta.gov.ar (2007-12-16). Retrieved on 2010-12-14. including a 15-year-old girl, nicknamed \\"La doncella\\" (the maiden), a seven- year-old boy, and a six-year-old girl, nicknamed \\"La ni√±a del rayo\\" (the lightning girl). The latter's nickname reflects the fact that sometime during the 500-years on the summit, the preserved body was struck by lightning, partially burning it and some of the ceremonial artifacts. The three mummies are exhibited in rotating fashion at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, specially built for them in Salta, Argentina.New York Times article and slide show on the Llullaillaco mummies Scientific investigation suggests some child victims were drugged with ethanol and coca leaves during the time before their deaths.Inca mummies: Child sacrifice victims fed drugs and alcohol =Timoto- Cuicas culture= The Timoto-Cuicas worshiped idols of stone and clay, built temples, and offered human sacrifices. Until colonial times, children were sacrificed secretly in Laguna de Urao, (M√©rida). This was chronicled by Juan de Castellanos, who described the feasts and human sacrifices that were done in honour of Icaque, an Andean prehispanic goddess.http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/123456789/18495/1/articulo3.pdf De los timoto-cuicas a la invisibilidad del indigena andino y a su diversidad culturalhttp://issuu.com/bnahem/docs/revista_digital_timoto_cuicas Timoto- Cuicas North America Mound 72 at the Mississippian culture site of Cahokia, directly across the Mississippi River from modern St. Louis, Missouri, contained the remains of \\"scores of clearly sacrificed female retainers\\" as well as four headless and handless male skeletons. The roughly contemporaneous site of Dickson Mounds, some 100 miles (150 km) to the north, also contained a mass grave with four headless male skeletons.Conrad, p. 130. The presence of the four bodies, whose heads were replaced with pots at burial, is not conclusive of ritualized sacrifice. The Pawnee practiced an annual Morning Star ceremony, which included the sacrifice of a young girl. Though the ritual continued, the sacrifice was discontinued in the 19th century.

Freeskiing, or new school skiing is a specific type of alpine skiing, which involves tricks, jumps, and terrain park features, such as rails, boxes, jibs, or other obstacles. This form of skiing resulted from the growth of snowboarding combined with the progression of freestyle skiing. \\"Newschoolers\\", or those who specifically ski in this style, as opposed to traditional freestylers, freeriders, big mountain skiers, and racers, are often found in terrain parks, which are designed specifically for tricks. Controversially, freestyle skiing is viewed as its own sport, but some view it as a subset of freeskiing. Some participants view it as a separate sport and do not refer to it as freestyle. The sport does not require participants to compete, but there are competitive events available at every level of the sport. Currently there are two Olympic freeskiing events, half-pipe skiing and slopestyle. These events make up two of the four Olympic freestyle skiing events. The sport has seen continual growth since its inception in the late 1990s. There is currently a growing number of professional freeskiers, most of whom compete, specializing in a certain freeskiing discipline, while a few do not compete, but rather produce and star in videos.  History  In the 1990s freestyle skiers, discouraged by restrictive rules placed on the sport by the International Ski Federation (FIS), began trying their tricks in what were at the time snowboard-only terrain parks. Early newschool skiers were very aware of the developing style and attitude of snowboarding, and adopted these for their own sport. The Newschool Skier is related more to the snowboarder in his/her style than to the traditional skier's style. The FIS freestyle skiing events were governed by restrictive rules that were unpopular in the growing ski community, and slowed down the progression of the sport. Such rules included a ban on inverted tricks in mogul runs, a limit on the number of flips in aerial competitions, and a lack of ski park or pipe competitions. The \\"Newschool\\" movement was a breakaway fraction of the freeskiers who were unhappy with the FIS. The breakaway faction was led by the New Canadian Air Force, which included the \\"Godfather of freeskiing\\", Mike Douglas, and others such as Vincent Dorion, JP Auclair and Shane Szocs. Also contributing significantly in these early days were Julien Regnier and \\"the Three Phils\\", namely, Phil Larose, Phil Belanger and Phil Dion, all of whom were teammates at Dynastar. After helping Salomon develop their first twin-tip ski, the \\"1080\\", the New Canadian Air Force began jumping and filming in traditionally snowboarder dominated terrain parks. In recent years, many ski resorts have introduced terrain parks where skiers and snowboarders can attempt tricks. These parks include many features like rails, boxes, jumps, hips, quarterpipes, and halfpipes. It is now quite common for 'Newschool' skiers to use urban features in towns and cities to perform tricks also done in the snowpark. A popular choice of equipment for this terrain is the twin-tip ski. Twin-tip skis come in all shapes and sizes, and were originally made specifically for newschool skiing. The varieties of twin-tip skis are now more versatile, being marketed towards skiers of all styles and abilities. Twin-tip skis are turned up at both ends to allow for both regular (forwards) and switch (backwards) skiing. Underpinning the revolution was a myriad of Movies, Websites and Magazines that showcased this new style of riding. Contests alone could not give an avenue for self-expression like intended, and a very healthy media distribution channel formed. Through these channels, athletes gained the ability to express themselves not only within the confines of contests, but also through imagery, videos and news articles. In 2007, the formation of the Association of Freeskiing Professionals (AFP), created a unified global tour of competitions and ranking system for freeskiing athletes. Created as a unified voice for the athletes, the AFP organized freeskiing competitions in slopestyle, ski half pipe and big air disciplines under consistent guidelines of AFP sanctioned judging and format standards. This calendar of AFP sanctioned competitions and the AFP rankings serve as a roadmap for emerging talent in the sport, event organizers, coaches, nations, and the general public in regard to the sport of Freeskiing. Since 2008 the AFP has named World Champions in each discipline for men and women. The Overall World Championship is awarded each year to the best combined ranking in all disciplines (excluding big air for women). In 2012 the AFP changed the name of the Overall World Championship trophy to the Sarah Burke Trophy in honor of the fallen women's skiing pioneer Sarah Burke who died in a 2012 skiing accident in Utah. On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the addition of the men's and women's ski halfpipe and slopestyle events to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Olympic status for ski halfpipe is expected to have a direct impact on the training, funding, and resources available to athletes. In January 2011, the United States Ski and Snowboard Association launched U.S. Freeskiing in partnership with The North Face, which would presumably supply Olympic uniforms.  Newschool terrain  = Backcountry = Any skiing outside the prepared or marked trails is referred to as backcountry or off-piste skiing. This form of skiing is probably the most mortally dangerous (depending on where and how it is done) because of the high speeds, large drops (sometimes with hidden rocks in the landing), and avalanches. This type of skiing has been banned in certain areas of the world because of chances of injury or death. Many see this form of skiing to be the most freeing, because it creates a relationship of just the skier and mountain. Backcountry skiers consist of both newschool skiers who perform tricks off various terrain features, and oldschoolers as well. = Park = Park is skiing on man-made features provided by the ski area such as jumps, rails, boxes, and halfpipes. According to Freeskier's 2010 Travel Guide the top resorts in North America for park are Breckenridge, Mammoth, Aspen/Snowmass, Park City, Poley Mountain, Whistler Blackcomb, Alivia, and Mount Snow. = Street or urban skiing = Street or urban skiing consists of sliding or grinding skis on rails, walls, ledges, or other features found in urban areas. Some professional freestyle or newschool skiers, such as Clayton Vila and Will Wesson, specialize in skiing on urban features, while being filmed, producing segments for skiing film companies such as Level 1 productions, Stept Productions, or 4bi9 media. In 2016, the X Games created a video competition called ‚ÄúX Games Real Ski‚Äù where a group of professional skiers selected by the X Games have the opportunity to film and submit an urban segment. Winners are selected by a panel of judges, and the public is also given an opportunity to vote for the fan favorite.  Industry  = \\"Core\\" Ski Manufacturers = There are many relatively small companies that have supported and greatly added to the progression of Newschool Skiing. These companies make skis specific for Newschool Skiing. Line is believed to be the first newschool skiing company.  Equipment  Freeskiing requires at least three pieces of gear. Skis, Ski boots and ski bindings. In addition to this, many skiers choose to use poles, goggles, ski clothing and safety gear such as helmets and avalanche gear. Almost everything used by freeskiers is designed specifically for use in freeskiing rather than ordinary skiing. = Types of skis = There are three kinds of newschool skis: powder, all-mountain and park (twin tip).  Powder  Powder skis, also called big-mountain or backcountry skis, have a wide waist width, making them ideal for places with heavy powder. The extra surface area helps skiers to float above premium powder. However, they can be difficult to use on slopes with less snow or groomed trails, especially for beginning to moderate skiers. Experienced skiers sometimes buy powder skis as an alternate pair, to be used when conditions warrant it. True backcountry skis have a waist width of 90 to 110 millimeters, while powder skis are the widest type, measuring from 110 to 140 millimeters.  All-mountain  Most Alpine skis fall into this category. All-mountain skis are designed to perform in all types of snow conditions and at most speeds. Narrower all-mountain skis are better for groomed runs, while wider styles handle better in powder and poor conditions. Other names for this style of ski include mid-fat skis, all-purpose skis, and the one-ski quiver.  Park  Park skis are often designed with a more symmetrical shape to make switch (backwards) skiing much easier and reinforced edges to withstand rails. Eric Pollard designed the first two symmetrical skis, the Anthem and the Invader. Pollard now has his own pro model skis from Line skis called the EP Pro (Mr. Pollard's Opus - 2012), the Elizabeth and the Sir Francis Bacon. Some new powder and all-mountain skis are created with 'reverse camber' (aka 'rocker') meaning that the tips and tails are bent up slightly to make powder landings easier.  Terminology  = Rail Tricks = * Spin on : When a skier spins around before landing on a rail, generally done in increments of 180 degrees starting at 270 (e.g. 270,450 630). When performed, spin on tricks are called in the following fashion: spin amount (can be full name or abbreviated) + on. For example, 450-on, and 4-on are both proper ways to call a trick. * Spin out : When a skier spins at the end of a rail, generally done increments of 180 degrees starting at 270 (e.g. 270, 450, 630). When performed, spin out tricks are called in the following fashion: spin amount (can be full name or abbreviated) + out. For example, 450-out, and 4-out are both proper ways to call a trick. * Switch-up : While sliding a rail the skier jumps and turns 180 degrees so they end up sliding the rail in the opposite direction. Also called 'swap'. Swaps can be done 'frontside' or 'backside/blindside'. As well, skiers can switch-up more than 180 degrees; for example, a '360-switch-up'/'3-swap' involves the skier jumping on a rail feature, spinning 360 degrees, and landing again on the rail. * K-Fed : A front switch-up blind 270 out. Higher increments of spin are called \\"Super- Fed\\", \\"Super-Duper-Fed\\", \\"Future-Fed\\" and \\"Super-Future Fed\\" for spins of 450, 630, 810, and 990 out, respectively. The term \\"K-Fed\\" was invented by the members of 4bi9 media, more specifically Tyler Barnes. * Blind swap two out : A blind switch-up front 270 out. This trick is sometimes referred to as a Britney. * Disaster : Gap over one kink on a kinked rail. * 50/50 : Both skis on the rail feature, parallel to the feature. * Ski Slide : One ski is on the rail feature, while the other is off * Hippy Killer, Bindsoul, Jack Knife, Dick Squeeze, etc... : All are \\"rail wizardry\\" tricks popularized by Andy Parry. The Hippy Killer, the most well-known of these, involves bringing your trailing ski up and over the side of a box, using your ski to latch on the underside of the box, and then using this to perform a switch up. = Jump Tricks = * Spin : The most basic of jump tricks; a skier spins upright while airborne in increments of 180 degrees. Often abbreviated as just the first number for spins below 1000 degrees and the first two numbers for spins above 1000 degrees (e.g. two full spins, or 720 degrees of rotation is abbreviated to '7' while a 1080 is abbreviated to '10'). * Backflip : A backwards flip. * Rodeo : An off-axis flip thrown backwards with a spin (most commonly 540 - 'Rodeo 5'). * Misty : An off-axis flip thrown forwards with a spin (most commonly 540 - 'Misty 5'). * Side flip Loop : A flip thrown directly towards the shoulder. It is essentially a cartwheel in the air. * Lincoln Loop : A tilted backflip done more like a backflip in direction but as side flip with the body * Flat Spin : An off-axis flip that is thrown over the shoulder. It is in-between a backflip and a lincoln loop. * Cork : Backwards thrown off- axis spin, at no point should the feet be over the head. A short video of Cork * D-Spin : Backwards thrown off-axis spin, similar to a cork except the feet will be more at-level with head, or even slightly above. * Bio : Forwards thrown off-axis spin, at no point should the feet be over the head. = Slang = * Steeze : Used to say something such as a skiers style, or a particular trick, was visually appealing or 'steezy'. 'Steeze' is a portmanteau of 'style' and 'ease'. Example: 'Man, that flip you did was steezy'; or, 'you have killer steeze'. * Spin-to-Win : A common complaint in the ski community when a competition is won by performing more difficult tricks - or those with greater amounts of rotation, with less emphasis on style or perfection. * Sandbag : The act of participating in an event where one's skill far exceeds that of the intended group. A professional competing in an amateur competition would be said to be 'sandbagging' the competition. * Solid Seven : A derogatory term used to say something was visually appealing. *Gaper : Derogatory term for an inexperienced skier. A stereotypical \\"gaper gap\\" is one between the skier's goggles and helmet or hat. See also punter, jerry. * Punter : Derogatory term for an inexperienced skier, especially a day tripper. * Jerry : Derogatory term for an inexperienced skier with little knowledge of ski etiquette or culture, or a skier who has expensive equipment or a look modelled after a pro, yet little skill also popularized by the instagram account jerry of the day. * Cool Story Hansel : A largely antiquated term used by newschoolers to inform another skier that they don't really care what they have to say. * Stomped : An effortless looking and balanced landing. * Train : Two or more skiers hitting a single jump at or near the same time so that at least two people are airborne at the same time. * Hucked : Someone doing a trick on a smaller jump than is usual for the trick (\\"He hucked a 1080 on that tiny jump\\") OR someone attempting a trick with a large amount of uncertainty success ('She had never tried a rodeo before; but, she just hucked it'). * Future Spin : A spin trick where the skier spins so much that the number of degrees spun exceeds the numerical value of the current year. To successfully land a future spin at this day and age, a skier would have to spin 2020 degrees or more (closest rotation would be 2160 degrees, that is, six full revolutions). * Afterbang : Landing an outrageous trick and acting as if it took little effort; 'leaned back and relaxed'.

The text of this section is slightly different in Northern Ireland. Assault The expression assault includes \\"battery\\".Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 2009 edition, at paragraph 19-195. Thomson/Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2009 Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner was decided under section 51 of the Police Act 1964, which also used the word \\"assault\\" without further explanation and without any explicit reference to battery. James J. said: In R v Williams (Gladstone),R v Williams (Gladstone), (1983) 78 Cr App R 276, [1984] Crim LR 163, CA (28 November 1983) the defendant was prosecuted for this offence. Lord Lane said: In R v Burstow, R v Ireland,R v Ireland, R v Burstow [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, The Times (1997) 25 July 1997, HL one of the defendants was prosecuted for this offence. Lord Steyn said: The second form of assault referred to is the offence described as common assault in section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which is also known as psychic assault or simply assault. Occasioning Blackstone's Criminal Practice, 2001, says that \\"occasioning\\" is equivalent to causing (para B2.21 at p. 172) and has a specimen form of indictment that uses the word \\"caused\\" (para B2.18 at p. 171). In R v Roberts,R v Roberts (1971) 56 Cr. App. R. 95, CA the defendant gave a lift in his car, late at night, to a woman. The woman said that while travelling in the defendant's car he sought to make advances towards her and then tried to take her coat off. She said that this was the last straw, and although the car was travelling at some speed, she jumped out and sustained injuries. The defendant said that he had not touched the woman. He said that he had had an argument with her and that in the course of that argument she suddenly opened the door and jumped out.This is how the facts are described in R v Savage Stephenson LJ said that the test for determining whether the defendant had \\"occasioned\\" the injuries that the girl had suffered as a result of jumping out of the car was this: This passage was set out in R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter at page 14.R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter, p. 14 The book \\"Archbold\\" says that this test applies to any case where the injury was not the direct result of the defendant's act.Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 1999, paragraph 19-195 at page 1612 In R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter,R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, HL Savage threw beer over the victim and, in the struggle, the glass broke and cut the victim. It was held that section 47 did not require proof of recklessness in relation to the \\"occasioning\\". The throwing of the beer was an assault, and that \\"assault\\" had occasioned the actual bodily harm which occurred in the continuing struggle. Parmenter injured his baby by tossing him about too roughly. Even though the baby was too young to apprehend the physical contact, there was voluntary contact that caused injury, so Parmenter was liable under section 47 because the injury resulted from his intention to play with his son. Actual bodily harm In Rex v. Donovan,Rex v. Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498, 25 Cr App R 1, 30 Cox 187, 50 TLR 566, CCA Swift J., in delivering the Judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said: This passage was cited and approved in R v Brown (Anthony),R v.

Google Books. = Cutting hair = In DPP v Smith (Michael Ross), the defendant held down his former girlfriend and cut off her ponytail with kitchen scissors a few weeks before her 21st birthday. The Magistrates acquitted him on the ground that, although there was undoubtedly an assault, it had not caused actual bodily harm, since there was no bruising or bleeding, and no evidence of any psychological or psychiatric harm. The victim‚Äôs distress did not amount to bodily harm. The Divisional Court allowed an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, rejecting the argument for the defendant that the hair was dead tissue above the scalp and so no harm was done. Judge P said: It has been accepted that actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of the victim, and which is more than transient or trifling. To damage an important physical aspect of a person‚Äôs bodily integrity must amount to actual bodily harm, even if the element damaged is dead skin or tissue. As Creswell J. commented in his short concurring judgment: =CPS charging standards= The Crown Prosecution Service has revised the guidance in its publication \\"Offences Against the Person, Incorporating the Charging Standard\\" due to the enactment of section 58 of the Children Act 2004 which provides that reasonable chastisement is not a defence to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Assertions at that time that minor injuries to children could be charged as actual bodily harm were withdrawn in 2011. The CPS previously advised that an assault which resulted in nothing more than grazes, scratches, abrasions, minor bruising, swellings, reddening of the skin, superficial cuts or a black eye should be prosecuted as a common assault in the absence of aggravating factors other than injury.Ormerod, D. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. Page 620. The guidance was located at www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P48_1458. The charging standard states: \\"The offence of Common Assault carries a maximum penalty of six months‚Äô imprisonment. This will provide the court with adequate sentencing powers in most cases. ABH should generally be charged where the injuries and overall circumstances indicate that the offence merits clearly more than six months; imprisonment and where the prosecution intend to represent that the case is not suitable for summary trial.\\" And in reference to vulnerable victims such as children: > There may be exceptional cases where the injuries suffered by a victim are > not serious and would usually amount to Common Assault but due to the > presence of significant aggravating features (alone or in combination), they > could more appropriately be charged as ABH contrary to section 47 of the > Offences Against the Person Act 1861. This would only be where a sentence > clearly in excess of six months' imprisonment ought to be available, having > regard to the significant aggravating features. The CPS also previously said that, by way of example, it considered the following injuries to be actual bodily harm and to be sufficiently serious that they could not be adequately reflected by a charge of common assault and ought normally to be prosecuted under section 47: * The loss or breaking of a tooth or teeth * Extensive or multiple bruising * A displaced broken nose * Minor fractures of bones * Minor (but not superficial) cuts requiring medical treatment * A recognised psychiatric disorder Causing any of these injuries (by assault or battery) would constitute the actus reus of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. =Mens rea= The mens rea of this offence is identical to that of assault or battery (depending on the mode by which the offence is committed). Accordingly, it does not correspond with the actus reus. Academic writers have termed this feature of the offence half mens reaGlanville Williams, Textbook of the Criminal Law, 2 ed., 1983 p.192 and constructive liability.Smith&Hogan; (2008). Criminal law text and materials (3rd ed.). OUP, New York, p.608 The mens rea for this crime may be one of recklessness rather than intention as to the commission of an assault or battery, and it is considered to be a crime of basic intent. The court in DPP v Parmenter ruled that, for this offence, =Mode of trial= In England and Wales, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is triable either way.The Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 5(h) =Sentence= In England and Wales, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,The Offences against the Person Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; the Penal Servitude Act 1891 (54 & 55 Vict. c.69), section 1(1); the Criminal Justice Act 1948 (11 & 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1) or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.The Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 (c.43), section 32(1) Where a person is convicted on indictment of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.The Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 and then by section 127 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 because it is a specified violent offence.The Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 20 Part 1 of Schedule 15 It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.The Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 224(2) This means that sections 227 and 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.The Criminal Justice Act 2003, sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i) See Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing ManualCrown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual for case law on sentencing.

On 28 April 1595 he succeeded Luis Ruiz as the last Spanish maestro di cappella of the viceroyal chapel of the Spanish viceroys in Palermo.Maurice Esses History and background, music and dance 1992 p21 \\"For example, Sebastian Raval succeeded Luis Ruiz as maestro of the royal chapel in 1595 and worked there until his death in 1604-46 Thereafter, however, Italians held the position of chapel-master at Palermo.\\" In Sicily, he again challenged a musician, Achille Falcone, to a contest; it was first decided in Falcone's favour but, after some appeals, in Raval's. After Falcone's death in 1600, Antonio Falcone, father of Achille, published all the process of this musical duel in his Relazione del successo and took Raval and Falcone's pieces (the object of this competition) to print including several canons, madrigals, motets and ricercari. This edition of both Falcone and Raval's pieces is available in a modern edition. Sebasti√°n Raval died in Palermo in 1604. In 2004, the city of Cartagena, his birth city, paid homage to him, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of his death, with a concert conducted by the violist Pere Ros. Works Raval composed religious polyphonic music, madrigals and instrumental ricercari. Raval's oeuvre has not yet studied in depth.

The Latin term vigilia, from which the word is derived meant a night watch, not necessarily in a military context, and generally reckoned as a fourth part of the night from sunset to sunrise. The four watches or vigils were of varying length in line with the seasonal variation of the length of the night. The English term \\"wake\\", which later became linked to a gathering before a funeral, also denoted originally such a prayer service,John Harland, T. T. Wilkinson, Lancashire Legends, Traditions, Pageants, Sports, Etc. (George Routledge and Sons 1873), pp. 123‚Äì125 and the term \\"vigil\\" is even now also used for a funeral service of that kind.Congregation for Divine Worship, Order of Christian Funerals ICEL 1989), p. 12Leonel L. Mitchell, 'Pastoral and Occasional Liturgies: A Ceremonial Guide (Cowley Publications 1998)  Early Christianity  The practice of rising for prayer in the middle of the night is as old as the Christian Church.Benedictine Monks of Buckfast Abbey, \\"Divine Office: Matins ‚Äî Prayer at Night\\", Homiletic and Pastoral Review, pp.361-367, Joseph F. Wagner, Inc., New York, NY, January 1925 There is evidence of the practice from the first years of the second century.Christopher L. Webber, A Book of Vigils (Church Publishing 2002), p. 1 Pliny the Younger reported in about 112 that Christians gathered on a certain day before light, sang hymns to Christ as to a god and shared a meal.Pliny, Letters 10.96-97 Tertullian (c. 155 ‚Äì c. 240) speaks of the \\"nocturnal convocations\\" (nocturnae convocationes) of Christians and their \\"absence all the night long at the paschal solemnities\\" (sollemnibus Paschae abnoctantes)Tertullian, Ad uxorem, II,4; Latin text Cyprian (c. 200 ‚Äì 258) also speaks of praying at night, but not of doing so as a group: \\"Let there be no failure of prayers in the hours of night ‚Äî no idle and reckless waste of the occasions of prayer\\" (nulla sint horis nocturnis precum damna, nulla orationum pigra et ignava dispendia).Cyprian, De oratione dominica, 36 (near end); Latin text The Apostolic Tradition speaks of prayer at midnight and again at cockcrow, but seemingly as private, not communal, prayer.Robert F. Taft, The Liturgy of the Hours in East and West: The Origins of the Divine Office and Its Meaning for Today (Liturgical Press 1986), pp. 25‚Äì26 The Peregrinatio Aetheriae describes the solemn celebration of vigils in the churches of Jerusalem in the early 380s. During the 3rd century and 4th century, in addition to the celebration of Mass, it was customary to hold a vigil, a prayer service in three parts, as night-watches in preparation for the feast.The Ecclesiastical Review, Vol. 34, 1906 Commenced in the evening, a vigil terminated only the following morning. Its liturgical was elastic, involving readings, singing of psalms, homilies, chants, and various prayers, followed by the Eucharistic service. These developed into the monastic celebrations, still called \\"vigils\\" in the Rule of Saint Benedict of the canonical hour that was later given the name of matins,Fernand Cabrol, \\"Matins\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911)  From 11th to 20th century  In the Middle Ages, entertainments such as dramatic representations of the saint or the event celebrated were added to vigils, but these were open to abuse. A synod held at Rouen in 1231 forbade the holding of \\"vigils\\" in church except on the patronal saint's feast alone and totally excluded the holding of dances in church or churchyard. C.J. Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, vol. V, p. 896 The liturgical celebration was moved to the morning hours and thus disassociated from the secular festivities, with the result that the word \\"vigil\\" took on the meaning of \\"the day before a feast\\", and the self-denial of the nighttime celebration was replaced by fasting on that preceding day.Frederick Hollweck, \\"Eve of a Feast\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1909) Even after the Protestant Reformation, the practice of fasting Vigils was maintained in the Church of England, whose Book of Common Prayer continued to indicate \\"Evens or Vigils\\" before 16 annual feasts, noting: \\"If any of these Feast-Days fall upon a Monday, then the Vigil or Fast-Day shall be kept upon the Saturday, and not upon the Sunday next before it.\\" The 16 feasts were Christmas Day, Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Easter Day, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Saint John the Baptist, All Saints, and these eight of the feasts of the Apostles: Saint Andrew (30 November), Saint Thomas (21 December), Saint Matthias (24 February or in a leap year, 25 February), Saints Peter & Paul (29 June), Saint James the Greater (25 July), Saint Bartholomew (24 August), Saint Matthew (21 September), and Saints Simon & Jude (28 October).The Book of Common Prayer ... With Notes ... by the Right Rev. Richard Mant ... Sixth Edition (Francis & John Rivington 1850), p. lxiv The List of Vigils in the Book of Common Prayer differs from that of the Tridentine Calendar: the primary difference is that the Book of Common Prayer, instead of having the Tridentine Calendar Vigils of St. Laurence (10 August) and of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Assumption (15 August), instead has the Vigils of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Annunciation (25 March) and of Her Purification (2 February). http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/info/tables/rules.html In 1879, Pope Leo XIII added to those in the Roman Rite the vigil of the Immaculate Conception, raising the number of vigils to 17. In 1955, Pope Pius XII reduced the number to 7, suppressing the vigils of the Immaculate Conception, Epiphany, and All Saints and all vigils of apostles except that of Saints Peter and Paul.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 47(1955), pages 218-224: decree Cum nostra hac aetate (De rubricis ad simpliciorem formam redigendis) of 23 March 1955, title II, 8‚Äì10 In the 1950s Pope Pius XII instituted a reform of the Easter Vigil, first on an experimental basis, then making it obligatory in 1955. Among other changes, he changed the hour of the service from Holy Saturday morning to after sunset in the following night, thus restoring it to something like the original meaning of a Christian vigil service. The Code of Rubrics published by his successor Pope John XXIII in 1960 explicitly recognized the altered character of the Easter Vigil, which made no longer applicable to it the definition of \\"vigil\\", as the \\"eve of a feast\\", that held for vigils since the Middle Ages. It declared: :By \\"vigil\\" is understood a liturgical day which precedes some feast and has the nature of a preparation for the feast. :The Easter vigil, however, since it is not a liturgical day, is celebrated in its own way, as a night watch.Code of Rubrics, 28  Present usage  Pope Paul VI's 1969 motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis made the liturgical day correspond in general to what is generally understood today, running from midnight to midnight, instead of beginning with vespers of the evening before. By exception, the celebration of Sundays and solemnities begins already on the evening of the preceding day.Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 3 In the Liturgy of the Hours, the canonical hour that used to be called matins and that Benedictine monks celebrated at about 2 a.m. is now called the Office of Readings. \\"While retaining its nocturnal character for those who wish to celebrate a vigil, [it] is now of such a nature that it can be said at any time during the day\\".Apostolic Constitution Laudis canticum, \\"the principles which underlie this new form of the Liturgy of the Hours\\", 2. The Catholic Church has thus restored to the word \\"vigil\\" the meaning it had in early Christianity. For those who wish to extend, in accordance with tradition, the celebration of the vigil of Sundays, solemnities and feasts, Appendix I in the book of the Liturgy of the Hours indicates for each three Old Testament canticles and a Gospel reading for optional insertion after the regular readings. The Gospel reading may be followed by a homily.Liturgy of the Hours, Appendix I = Vigil Mass = A few solemnities are \\"endowed with their own Vigil Mass, which is to be used on the evening of the preceding day, if an evening Mass is celebrated\\".Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 11 The readings and prayers of such vigil Masses differ from the texts in the Masses to be celebrated on the day itself. The solemnities that have a vigil Mass are: # Easter Sunday # The Ascension of the Lord # Pentecost # The Nativity of St John the Baptist (24 June) # St Peter & St Paul (29 June) # The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August) # The Nativity of the Lord (25 December) # The Epiphany of the Lord (6 January or Sunday between 2 and 8 January) Sundays as such have no vigil Mass: only if one of the listed solemnities falls on a Sunday (as Easter and Pentecost always do) is there a difference between the readings and prayers at the Saturday evening Mass and Mass on the Sunday itself. While the Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar thus give a restricted meaning to the term \\"vigil Mass\\", the same term is sometimes used in a broader sense as indicated by the Collins English Dictionary definition: \\"a Mass held on Saturday evening, attendance at which fulfils one's obligation to attend Mass on Sunday\\".Collins English Dictionary: \\"Vigil Mass\\" An \\"anticipated Mass\\" is another name used for such a Mass attended in fulfilment of the obligation spoken of in the Code of Canon Law, \\"On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are obliged to participate in the Mass. [...] A person who assists at a Mass celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the feast day itself or in the evening of the preceding day satisfies the obligation of participating in the Mass\\".Code of Canon Law, canons 1247‚Äì1248).

He joined the Society of Jesus in 1736, and in 1749 proceeded to Paraguay, where for eighteen years he worked devotedly first among the Guaranis, and then among the Abipones. Returning to Europe, on the expulsion of the Jesuits from South America, he settled at Vienna, obtained the friendship of Maria Theresa, survived the suppression of his order, and wrote the history of his mission. He died in Vienna in 1791. Book The book on which his claim to fame rests, \\"An Account of the Abipones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay\\" was found in Vienna in 1784 in the author's own Latin, and in a German translation by Professor Kreil of the University of Pest. Of its contents some idea may be obtained from its extended title: :Historia de Abiponibus, equestri bellicosaque Paraquariae natione, locupletata copiosis barbarorum gentium, urbium, fluminum, ferarum, amphibiorum, insectorum, serpentium praecipuorum, piscium, avium, arborum, plantarum aliarumque ejusdem provinciae proprietatum observationibus The work, published in three volumes, London, 1822, there appeared in London, an anonymous English translation sometimes ascribed to Southey, but really the work of Sara Coleridge, who had undertaken the task to defray the college expenses of one of her brothers.

Tregarthen was born in Penzance, Cornwall, the son of James Tregarthen of St Mary's, Scilly, and Morrab Road, Penzance, and Susan Bevan, the daughter of John Coulson of Penzance. He was educated at Penzance Grammar School and Wren's, and graduated with Mathematical Honours from London University in 1878. The following year he was appointed Mathematical Master at Trinity College School, a grammar school in Stratford-on-Avon. Coulson bought the school within a few years and was its headmaster for six years, from 1885‚Äì1900. While resident in the town he was good friends with the writers Marie Corelli and Madame Sarah Grand, and in his late forties he sold the school to Marie Corelli and retired to Cornwall. Here the energetic Tregarthen was able to pursue his naturalist interests fully, and began to write about the wildlife he saw around him. Corelli was soon to become his mentor, recommending him to her publisher, John Murray, and Tregarthen subsequently was to dedicate many of his books to her.Introduction by Bert Biscoe in the 2004 Cornwall Editions Ltd reprint of John Penrose Tregarthen was President of the Midland Cornish Association in 1901, President of the Royal Institution of Cornwall (1927‚Äì29), a Fellow of the Zoological Society, a county councillor and JP, and was made a bard of Gorseth Kernow in 1928, taking the bardic name Mylgarer, ('Lover of Wild Animals'). In 1881 Tregarthen married Rose, the youngest daughter of W. Huntley Bailey of Maida Vale; they had one son. Tregarthen spent his final years at his house, \\"Rosemorran\\", which is in Edgecumbe Gardens, Newquay, Cornwall. He was buried at St Columb Minor, Cornwall.

She received her PhD in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in 2004. Turnbull is an authority on star systems which may have habitable planets, solar twins and planetary habitability. She is also an expert on the use of the coronagraph in the direct detection of exoplanets. In 2002, Turnbull developed the HabCat along with Jill Tarter, a catalog of potentially habitable stellar systems. The following year Turnbull went on to further identify 30 particularly suitable stars from the 5,000 in the HabCat list that are within 100 light years of Earth. In 2006, Turnbull drew up two shortlists of just five stars each. The first formed the basis of SETI radio searches with the Allen Telescope Array (Beta Canum Venaticorum, HD 10307, HD 211415, 18 Scorpii, and 51 Pegasi). The second are her top candidates for the Terrestrial Planet Finder (Epsilon Indi, Epsilon Eridani, 40 Eridani, Alpha Centauri B, and Tau Ceti). Turnbull's work has continued to be an integral component in the search for life in the universe and she regularly contributes to the discussion on how life is defined and strategies for its detection. Her previous work on target selection with the HabCat list and expertise with coronagraphs have made her an important advocate for direct exoplanet imaging missions, and she served as Science Team Leader for the New Worlds Mission. In 2016, Turnbull became a leader of a Science Investigation Team for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), which is simulating mission data and selecting targets for the direct imaging exoplanet searches. In 2017, Turnbull worked with Stephen Kane to place constraints on the mass of Proxima Centauri b, the nearest exoplanet to our solar system. Asteroid 7863 Turnbull, discovered by Brian A.

The hydrated derivative, which contains one molecule of water for each Cu atom, is available commercially. Anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 is a dark green crystalline solid, whereas Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is more bluish-green. Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as fungicides and green pigments. Today, copper acetates are used as reagents for the synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds. Copper acetate, like all copper compounds, emits a blue-green glow in a flame. The mineral hoganite is a naturally occurring form of copper(II) acetate. Structure The dinuclear structure of dimeric copper(II) acetate hydrate Copper(II) acetate monohydrate, dichroic Copper acetate hydrate adopts the paddle wheel structure seen also for related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates. One oxygen atom on each acetate is bound to one copper at 1.97 √Ö (197 pm). Completing the coordination sphere are two water ligands, with Cu‚ÄìO distances of 2.20 √Ö (220 pm). The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.62 √Ö (262 pm), which is close to the Cu‚ÄìCu separation in metallic copper. The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90 K, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins. Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 was a critical step in the development of modern theories for antiferromagnetic coupling. Synthesis Copper(II) acetate is prepared industrially by heating copper(II) hydroxide or basic copper(II) carbonate with acetic acid. Related compounds Heating a mixture of anhydrous copper(II) acetate and copper metal affords copper(I) acetate: :Cu + Cu(OAc)2 ‚Üí 2 CuOAc Unlike the copper(II) derivative, copper(I) acetate is colourless and diamagnetic. \\"Basic copper acetate\\" is prepared by neutralizing an aqueous solution of copper(II) acetate. The basic acetate is poorly soluble. This material is a component of verdigris, the blue-green substance that forms on copper during long exposures to atmosphere. Uses in chemical synthesis Copper(II) acetate has found some use as an oxidizing agent in organic syntheses. In the Eglinton reaction Cu2(OAc)4 is used to couple terminal alkynes to give a 1,3-diyne: :Cu2(OAc)4 \\\\+ 2 RC‚â°CH ‚Üí 2 CuOAc + RC‚â°C‚àíC‚â°CR + 2 HOAc The reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of copper(I) acetylides, which are then oxidized by the copper(II) acetate, releasing the acetylide radical. A related reaction involving copper acetylides is the synthesis of ynamines, terminal alkynes with amine groups using Cu2(OAc)4.. It has been used for hydroamination of acrylonitrile. It is also an oxidising agent in Barfoed's test. It combines with arsenic trioxide to form copper acetoarsenite, a powerful insecticide and fungicide called Paris Green or Schweinfurt Green.

The protest was held for seven days in a major highway in Metropolitan Manila, the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), which eventually culminated in an attempt to storm Malaca√±ang. Taking place four months after the EDSA Revolution of 2001, the protests were considered as a more populist and representative uprising in comparison to the previous demonstrations in the same location in January 2001. The protests and the attack on the presidential palace, however, failed in their objectives. Participants continue to claim that it was a genuine People Power event, a claim disputed by the participants and supporters of EDSA II. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has acknowledged the divisive nature of the two terminologies by saying in one statement that she hoped to be the president of \\"EDSA II and EDSA III\\". April 25‚Äì30 EDSA Shrine The crowd of an alleged several hundred thousand people (although according to Eagle Broadcasting Corporation-owned broadcast network Net 25 and to Senator Sotto, a high of over 3 million in the evening from April 25‚Äì30), most of whom were members of the urban poor and devotees of the Iglesia ni Cristo which institutionally supported Estrada, gathered at the Roman Catholic EDSA Shrine, the site of the January EDSA II revolt which had toppled Estrada from the presidency. News organizations aiming to cover the rally were advised not approach the area, as there were reports of stones being thrown at cameramen, particularly those from ABS-CBN. The protest was led by members of the political opposition of the time, most notably Senators Juan Ponce Enrile, Vicente Sotto III, Gringo Honasan, Panfilo Lacson and Miriam Defensor- Santiago. May 1 The rebellion sought to remove Arroyo from the presidency and to reinstate Estrada. The rebellion came to a head on the morning of May 1, 2001, as most of the people left, specifically the Iglesia ni Cristo members, as an agreement between their leaders and the government occurred. Yet hundreds of thousands of protesters still stormed towards Malaca√±ang Palace, the presidential residence; government soldiers and the policemen dispersed the marchers, causing violence. Several broadcast vans of ABS-CBN were torched by members of the crowd, while others attacked the police and soldiers with rocks, sticks, and pipes. The police and military responded with force after implementing a \\"maximum tolerance\\" policy, which led to the injury of many of the protesters.http://www.pcij.org/stories/2002/inc.html President Arroyo declared a State of Rebellion in the National Capital Region pursuant to Proclamation No. 38 and arrested leaders who participated in the said rebellion like Senator Juan Ponce Enrile but released on bail.CNN News On May 7, 2001, President Arroyo lifted the State of Rebellion. Hours after the crowds of EDSA III were dispersed, representatives of the Archdiocese of Manila and Civil Society supporters of the Arroyo administration reclaimed the EDSA Shrine where there had been alleged acts of vandalism and garbage everywhere and the vicinity reeked with the strong smell of human waste. Since this protest was carried out mostly by the lower income, uneducated masses, widespread destruction and vandalism of public utilities (stop lights and street posts where thrown down) crew cab of ABS-CBN were burned down and public stores fronting along the protest routes at Claro M. Recto Avenue, Legarda Street, Chino Roces (Mendiola) Street, Rizal Avenue, Nicanor Reyes (Morayta Street) and Quezon Boulevard. Most of those arrested were later set free. As for the public figures that supported the rallies, they abandoned them and shied away at its most critical time when it became obvious, that unlike the previous administrations, the Arroyo administration was not backing down from this latest people power styled protest which it perceived was political manipulation which resulted in mob mentality and anarchy of the masses urged by its political opponents. Criticism Critics of EDSA Tres, styled after the People Power Revolution (EDSA Revolution) and EDSA Revolution of 2001, argue that while this was a major protest, the spirit of it was unlike of the first and second protests. Supporters of EDSA Tres journalism allege that EDSA's I and II's participants were made up of the upper middle class and thus, not democratically representative unlike those who participated in EDSA Tres. Other arguments also point to the success of the first two to remove the presidents targeted, versus this event's failure to do so.

A best- seller, Michelle Remembers was the first book written on the subject of Satanic ritual abuse (SRA) and is an important part of the controversies beginning during the 1980s regarding SRA and recovered memory. Several investigators have subsequently been unable to corroborate many of the book's events despite extensive searches. According to these investigators, the events described in the book were very unlikely and in some cases seemingly impossible. Background Michelle Remembers chronicles Pazder's therapy during the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith. In 1973 Pazder first started treating Smith at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that she had something important to tell him, but could not remember what it was. Soon thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith purportedly screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. According to Pazder, during the next 14 months he spent more than 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover seeming memories of Satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five years old in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a \\"satanic cult\\" in Victoria. =Summary= The book documents Smith's memory of events recovered during therapy, documenting the many Satanic rituals she believed that she was forced to attend (Pazder stated that Smith was abused by the \\"Church of Satan,\\" which he states is a worldwide organization predating the Christian church). The first alleged ritual attended by Smith occurred in 1954 when she was five years old, and the final one documented by the book was an 81-day ritual in 1955 that supposedly summoned Satan himself and involved the intervention of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Michael the Archangel, who removed the scars received by Smith throughout the year of abuse and blocked memories of the events \\"until the time was right\\". During the rites, Smith was allegedly tortured, locked in cages, sexually assaulted, forced to participate in various rituals, witnessed several human sacrifices, and was rubbed with the blood and body parts of various sacrificed infants and adults. After Smith had seemingly recovered her memories, she and Pazder consulted with various church authorities, eventually traveling to the Vatican. Publication history Michelle Remembers was first publicized with articles in People magazine and the National Enquirer. During 1980, Pazder and Smith toured the United States to promote the book. Ultimately a publishing success, the book earned Pazder and Smith a $100,000 hard-cover advance, $242,000 for paperback rights, royalties, and a potential movie deal. In 1989, almost 10 years after the publication of Michelle Remembers, Oprah Winfrey featured Smith as a guest on her show alongside Laurel Rose Willson, author of the equally fictitious Satanic ritual abuse survival memoir Satan‚Äôs Underground, which was published using the pseudonym Lauren Stratford. Both women‚Äôs experiences were presented by Winfrey as incontrovertible fact, and not once did she question the authenticity of any claim in either book. Criticism Pazder was a credentialed psychiatrist and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the book states that its source materials (therapy tapes) were scrutinized. However, the accuracy of the allegations in Michelle Remembers was questioned soon after the book was published. After the book's publication, Pazder withdrew his assertion that it was the Church of Satan that had abused Smith when Anton LaVey (who founded the church years after the alleged events of Michelle Remembers) threatened to sue for libel. In an October 27, 1980 article in the magazine Maclean's, Paul Grescoe interviewed Smith's father, Jack Proby, who denied the allegations against Smith's mother, Virginia (who died in 1964), and claimed he could refute all the allegations in the book. Grescoe also noted that the book failed to make any mention of Smith's two sisters, Charyl (younger) and Tertia (older), or that Pazder and Smith (both Catholics) had divorced their spouses and married each other. The book also fails to mention any police investigations or any attempt Pazder made to involve the police in verifying any of the book's accusations. The authors of a 1995 book found no newspaper record of the car crash that the book describes in the time frame described despite the fact that the local newspaper reported on all vehicle accidents at the time. Former neighbors, teachers and friends were interviewed and yearbooks from Smith's elementary school were reviewed and found no indication of Smith being absent from school or missing for lengthy periods of time, including the alleged 81-day non-stop ceremony. Ultimately the book's authors were unable to find anyone who knew Smith during the 1950s who could corroborate any of the details in her allegations. A 2002 article by Kerr Cuhulain explored what Cuhulain considered the unlikeliness of Smith's allegations. Among other things, Cuhulain noted that it seemed unlikely that a sophisticated cult that had secretly existed for generations could be outwitted by a five-year-old; that the cult could hold rituals in the Ross Bay Cemetery unnoticed given that Smith claimed she was screaming and given that the Ross Bay Cemetery is surrounded on three sides by residential neighborhoods; that an 81-day non-stop ceremony involving hundreds of participants and a massive round room could have gone on in Victoria unnoticed; and that none of Smith's tormentors (other than her mother) have ever been identified, especially given that some of them had cut off one of their middle fingers at the Black Mass. He also notes that during the alleged 81-day ritual, Michelle was confirmed to be attending school, with no remarkable absences and no apparent signs that she was being abused. Like other authors, Cuhulain also noted that many of Smith's so-called recovered memories appear to have represented elements of popular culture at the time (e.g.: the movie The Exorcist) and Pazder's own religious beliefs and experiences from when he was living and working in Africa during the early 1960s. He noted it odd that Pazder didn't report any of the sexual abuse to police that Michelle allegedly had endured. Finally, Cuhulain hypothesized that Smith's motivation for making the allegations may have come from her desire to spend time with Pazder; though both were initially married to other people, they divorced their spouses and remarried each other after the publication of the book. James R. Lewis, in The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, wrote that Michelle Remembers \\"must be treated with great skepticism, not least because literally all the charges involved seem drawn from accounts of West African secret societies from the 1950s, imported to Canada.\\" Nichol Spanos has stated that in addition to the lack of corroboration of Smith's alleged memories, \\"skepticism appears warranted by the fact that some of these 'memories' involve Michelle's encounters with supernatural beings\\". Spanos also mentions that Smith's father and unmentioned two siblings deny the allegations made by Smith, as well as Pazder's time in West Africa during a time when there was widespread concern about secret, blood-drinking, cannibalistic cults. Despite the lack of evidence and criticism concerning the allegations made in Michelle Remembers, there are still people who believe that Smith‚Äôs claims of abuse are true, and are evidence of a worldwide intergenerational satanic conspiracy to abuse and sacrifice human beings. The book's contents have not been substantiated by any evidence beyond Smith's testimony. Despite this, the book allegedly inspired imitative accusations throughout the world, against members of the Church of Satan, other occultists, and others who seemed to have no association with the occult. =Witchcraft in City= The appendix to Michelle Remembers contains the reprint of the article Witchcraft in City' Claim\\" by Paul Jeune, as the article was referenced by Smith in the book concerning the alleged black magic practiced in Victoria. An evangelist named Len Olsen claimed on television evangelist David Mainse's talk show 100 Huntley Street that he and his wife were nearly sacrificed in a satanic ritual by Mark Fedoruk, also known as Lion Serpent Sun. Sun sued for defamation, and in court it was ascertained that Olsen had been delusional, apparently due to drug use and guilt; Sun was awarded $10,000 and an appeal was denied. The lawsuit and result were not reported in the book, only the original false allegations by Olsen. Results The Grescoe article did not garner much attention and the allegations in Michelle Remembers were still considered by many during the early 1980s to be true. As a result, Pazder was considered to be an expert in the topic of Satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden emergence of Satanic ritual abuse cases during the 1980s (likely due in part to the publication of Michelle Remembers) Pazder's expertise was requested. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial which featured allegations of Satanic ritual abuse. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report concerning Satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC‚Äôs television series 20/20. Pazder was part of the Cult Crime Impact Network and lectured to police agencies about Satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on Satanic ritual abuse cases. With people suddenly being prosecuted for Satanic ritual abuse, prosecutors used the book as a guide when preparing cases against alleged Satanists. Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases several local social workers had attended a training seminar that listed Satanic ritual abuse as a major element of child sexual abuse and used Michelle Remembers as training material.

The main theorem of Floquet theory, Floquet's theorem, due to , gives a canonical form for each fundamental matrix solution of this common linear system. It gives a coordinate change \\\\displaystyle y=Q^{-1}(t)x with \\\\displaystyle Q(t+2T)=Q(t) that transforms the periodic system to a traditional linear system with constant, real coefficients. When applied to physical systems with periodic potentials, such as crystals in condensed matter physics, the result is known as Bloch's theorem. Note that the solutions of the linear differential equation form a vector space. A matrix \\\\phi\\\\,(t) is called a fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions. A matrix \\\\Phi(t) is called a principal fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions and there exists t_0 such that \\\\Phi(t_0) is the identity. A principal fundamental matrix can be constructed from a fundamental matrix using \\\\Phi(t)=\\\\phi\\\\,(t){\\\\phi\\\\,}^{-1}(t_0). The solution of the linear differential equation with the initial condition x(0)=x_0 is x(t)=\\\\phi\\\\,(t){\\\\phi\\\\,}^{-1}(0)x_0 where \\\\phi \\\\,(t) is any fundamental matrix solution.  Floquet's theorem  Let \\\\dot{x}= A(t) x be a linear first order differential equation, where x(t) is a column vector of length n and A(t) an n \\\\times n periodic matrix with period T (that is A(t + T) = A(t) for all real values of t). Let \\\\phi\\\\, (t) be a fundamental matrix solution of this differential equation. Then, for all t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, : \\\\phi(t+T)=\\\\phi(t) \\\\phi^{-1}(0) \\\\phi (T). Here :\\\\phi^{-1}(0) \\\\phi (T) is known as the monodromy matrix. In addition, for each matrix B (possibly complex) such that :e^{TB}=\\\\phi^{-1}(0) \\\\phi (T), there is a periodic (period T) matrix function t \\\\mapsto P(t) such that :\\\\phi (t) = P(t)e^{tB}\\\\text{ for all }t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Also, there is a real matrix R and a real periodic (period-2T) matrix function t \\\\mapsto Q(t) such that :\\\\phi (t) = Q(t)e^{tR}\\\\text{ for all }t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. In the above B, P, Q and R are n \\\\times n matrices.  Consequences and applications  This mapping \\\\phi \\\\,(t) = Q(t)e^{tR} gives rise to a time-dependent change of coordinates (y = Q^{-1}(t) x), under which our original system becomes a linear system with real constant coefficients \\\\dot{y} = R y. Since Q(t) is continuous and periodic it must be bounded. Thus the stability of the zero solution for y(t) and x(t) is determined by the eigenvalues of R. The representation \\\\phi \\\\, (t) = P(t)e^{tB} is called a Floquet normal form for the fundamental matrix \\\\phi \\\\, (t). The eigenvalues of e^{TB} are called the characteristic multipliers of the system. They are also the eigenvalues of the (linear) Poincar√© maps x(t) \\\\to x(t+T). A Floquet exponent (sometimes called a characteristic exponent), is a complex \\\\mu such that e^{\\\\mu T} is a characteristic multiplier of the system. Notice that Floquet exponents are not unique, since e^{(\\\\mu + \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi i k}{T})T}=e^{\\\\mu T}, where k is an integer. The real parts of the Floquet exponents are called Lyapunov exponents. The zero solution is asymptotically stable if all Lyapunov exponents are negative, Lyapunov stable if the Lyapunov exponents are nonpositive and unstable otherwise. * Floquet theory is very important for the study of dynamical systems. * Floquet theory shows stability in Hill differential equation (introduced by George William Hill) approximating the motion of the moon as a harmonic oscillator in a periodic gravitational field. * Bond softening and bond hardening in intense laser fields can be described in terms of solutions obtained from the Floquet theorem.

At the age of twenty he took the vows of the Benedictine order at the abbey of Sainte Melaine, Rennes, and afterwards taught rhetoric and philosophy in several monasteries. His open advocacy of Jansenist opinions, however, caused his superiors to relegate him to the most obscure houses of the order, and finally to keep him under surveillance at the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s at Paris. Here he wrote a defence of the doctrine of the Real Presence against the Calvinists in the form of an apology for Rupert, abbot of Deutz (Apologia pro Ruperto abbate Tuitensi, Paris, 1669). In 1676 he published at Brussels, under the name of Sieur Flore de Ste Foi his Miroir de la pi√©t√© chr√©tienne, an enlarged edition of which appeared at Li√®ge in the following year. This was condemned by certain archbishops and theologians as the repetition of the five condemned propositions of Jansen, and Gerberon defended it, under the name of Abb√© Valentin in Le Miroir sans tache (Paris, 1680). He had by this time aroused against him the full fury of the Jesuits, and at their instigation a royal provost was sent to Corbie to arrest him. He had, however, just time to escape, and fled to the Low Countries, where he lived in various towns. He was invited by the Jansenist clergy to Holland, where he wrote another controversial work against the Protestants: D√©fense de l'√âglise Romaine contre la calomnie des Protestants (Cologne, 1688‚Äì1691). This produced unpleasantness with the Reformed clergy, and feeling himself no longer safe he returned to Brussels. In 1700 he published his history of Jansenism (Histoire g√©n√©rale du Jans√©nisme), considered a dry work, by which, however, he is best remembered. He adhered firmly to the Augustinian doctrine of Predestination, and on 30 May 1703 he was arrested at Brussels at the instance of the archbishop of Mechelen, and ordered to subscribe the condemnation of the five sentences of Jansen. On his refusal, he was handed over to his superiors and imprisoned in the citadel of Amiens and afterwards at Vincennes. Every sort of pressure was brought to bear upon him to make his submission, and at last, broken in health and spirit, he consented to sign a formula which the Cardinal de Noailles claimed as a recantation. Upon this he was released in 1710. The first use he made of his freedom was to write a work (which, however, his friends prudently prevented him from publishing), Le vain triomphe du cardinal de Noailles, containing a virtual withdrawal of the compulsory recantation. Gerberon was one of the most prolific writers of the Maurist Congregation. Ren√©-Prosper Tassin ascribes one hundred and eleven works to him, many of which, however, are spurious. Of the sixty-one works ascribed to him by de Lama, the following are the most important: *Apologia pro Ruperto Abbate Tuitiensi (Paris, 1669), in which he proves against Salmasius and other Protestants that Abbot Rupert of Deutz held the Catholic doctrine of the Real Presence *Histoire g√©n√©rale du Jans√©nisme (Amsterdam, 1700), 3 vols. *Acta Marii Mercatoris (Brussels, 1673) *Histoire de la robe sans couture de N.

He also edited the works of St. Anselm: S. Anselmi opera omnia, necnon Eadmeri monachi Cantuar. Historia Novorum et alia opuscula (Paris, 1675).

It belongs to the turtle family Emydidae, the pond turtles. It is the official reptile of the state of Alabama. Life history The red-belly inhabits the fresh to brackish waters of the Mobile- Tensaw River Delta in Mobile and Baldwin counties. It feeds on aquatic vegetation and can be found sunning itself on logs. Nesting of the red-bellied turtle occurs from May through July. Female turtles lay their eggs on dry land, digging nests in sandy soil, where 4 to 9 eggs are laid. Hatchlings usually emerge during the summer. However, when the turtles nest in late July, hatchlings may overwinter in the nest and emerge the following spring. A mature female can be 14 inches, while a mature male can be 12 inches. Location As of June 2009 the turtle has been seen in the central part of Alabama, in the Elmore County region. This turtle has also been found in south-eastern Mississippi,Southern Wonder: Alabama's Surprising Biodiversity by R.

The men subjected the girls to repeated rapes and sexual assaults on five or more separate occasions, while driving them to remote locations throughout rural New South Wales and Victoria.. Over a twelve-hour period, the girls had been driven several hundred kilometres from Bega to Fiddler's Green Creek in Victoria, where they were stabbed to death by Beckett under the order of Camilleri. Background The girls were reported missing on the day of their disappearance, and a massive manhunt consisting of family, friends, police and community volunteers combed the area but failed to locate any sign of the girls. Police investigations lasting several weeks eventually led to Camilleri and Beckett, career criminals with over 200 criminal convictions between them.

A psychiatric report prepared in 1993 spoke of Camilleri's deprived childhood, and \\"a pattern of theft and vandalism which have been his reaction to social ostracism, leading to frustration, which because of poor impulse control has ended in explosive outbursts of destructive behaviour\\".. Camilleri was considered \\"uncontrollable\\" as a child and spent a large part of his childhood in juvenile detention. He escaped the institution and, between the ages of 10 to 12, lived as a street kid in King's Cross, Sydney. Camilleri was eventually taken before the children's court by police and ordered to return to the institution, where he remained until he was 15. Four days prior to the abduction of Rosamari Gandarias in Canberra, and three weeks prior to the Bega murders, Camilleri appeared in the District Court of New South Wales on trial for charges relating to sexual offences against his de facto daughter. After two days the trial was aborted and Camilleri was released from custody on bail. Camilleri had 146 prior convictions for offences such as dishonesty, theft and wilful damage. At the time of the murders, he lived in . Camilleri had known Beckett for a period of two to three years and would often associate with him to steal cars. In 2012, Camilleri appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court via videolink from HM Prison Barwon to be charged with murdering 13-year-old schoolgirl Prudence \\"Prue\\" Bird, who disappeared from her home in February 1992. Camilleri had made admissions in a police interview, but there was a dispute over the alleged motive and how the murder was effected. On 5 December 2013, Camilleri was sentenced to an extra 28 years' imprisonment for the murder of Bird. =Lindsay Beckett= Lindsay Hoani Beckett (born 27 March 1974) was born in New Zealand and lived in the Bay of Plenty town of OpotikiOtago Daily Times August 1998 before moving to Australia. At the time of the murders, Beckett lived in Yass and had come to associate with Camilleri, five years his senior, in criminal pursuits. It would be Beckett who would eventually break and confess to police about the Bega murders, leading them to the bodies of the victims. It was claimed Camilleri exerted a strong influence over Beckett. In sentencing Beckett to life imprisonment, Justice Vincent described him as having \\"quite a low IQ\\" and as someone \\"who had fallen under the influence of an older individual of much stronger personality\\". In 2010, Beckett was moved to another jail after love letters from a former security guard were discovered in his cell. Beckett was 23 at the time of the murders. He will be 59 when eligible for parole in 2033. Events =Abduction of Barry and Collins= On 3 October 1997, a campsite was set up by the father of Nichole Collins at White Rock, near Bega, for his teenage daughter to invite friends over for the coming Labour Day weekend. The camp site was located from the Collins home. The girls would regularly call at the house while camping to change clothing, shower and eat. Collins's father regularly called at the camp site to check on the children and did so on the day the girls disappeared. About 9:00 p.m. on 5 October, Collins, wearing her high school jacket, and her younger friend Barry, left the camp site and walked off for a nearby party. Nearby, Camilleri and Beckett were riding in a Ford Telstar belonging to Camilleri's de facto partner. Camilleri had an argument hours earlier with his partner and talked to Beckett about his feelings of depression. The two men were consuming beer and injecting each other with amphetamines while driving aimlessly. According to Beckett, Camilleri spotted the girls walking single file along the Bega-Tathra Road in Evan's Hill and stopped to offer them a lift. At approximately 10:00 p.m., after a brief discussion, the girls entered the car willingly. A pink portable television, which had earlier been taken by Camilleri and Beckett from a friend in lieu of a drug-related debt, was removed from the back seat of the vehicle and discarded at the side of the road to provide room for the girls to sit. The television would later become important evidence and implicate the two men in their crimes to follow. Beckett told police the group travelled to Tathra Beach and spent some time there before returning to the campsite at White Rock. On the road leading to the campsite, Camilleri became disturbed at the car bottoming out on the uneven gravel road and became angry at the girls. The rear doors of the vehicle had been previously locked using the vehicle's child locks and there were no window winders, preventing the rear doors from being opened by passengers inside. Camilleri produced a knife and told the girls they would be stabbed if they tried to escape. Beckett also produced a knife and went along with Camilleri in threatening the girls. :\\"Whilst Les (Camilleri) was going off, he pulled his knife out of a pocket in the driver's door. This was a black handled pocketknife with a serrated edge. Les turned around to the girls and showed them the knife. He told them to shut up and not to say anything. Les said if they did not do what he said, he would stab them. During this Les told me to get my knife. I got my knife out of the glove box. I have a black-handled knife with a jagged edge. I showed the girls I had a knife, too. I said to the girls to do as Les says.\\" Camilleri reversed away from the campsite and drove onto Old Wallagoot Road. =Assaults= Rather than being returned to the campsite as earlier promised, the girls were driven to a rubbish dump off Old Wallagoot Road, not far from their homes in Kalaru, where they were both raped. The girls were then driven further south, passing through the town of Merimbula, until the car stopped at Ben Boyd National Park and the girls were further assaulted. A black rubber flashlight belonging to Barry and a tampon were later located at the scene by police. The group continued through the town of Eden, where the men again raped the girls in an area south of the town. Camilleri then ordered Beckett to drive, while Camilleri continued to force Barry to perform oral sex on him in the back seat. They drove towards Orbost before turning off and eventually stopping at Wingan Point in Victoria, where the girls were again assaulted. Camilleri slept, but later woke up and realised where he was. Beckett recalled in his statement to police, :\\"I drove down the highway and just before Cann River Les woke up. He wanted to know where we were. I told him we were in Victoria heading to Orbost. Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying he wanted to go to Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops.\\" The girls began to question the men, asking if they were going to be murdered. Camilleri assured the girls they would only be tied up so the men could make their escape. During this time Beckett, recalled Camilleri repeating the words, \\"They can't go back\\", referring to his intention to murder the girls to avoid detection for their crimes. =Double murder= The final stop, at about 8 o'clock the following morning, was at Fiddler's Green Creek, located just south of the Victoria/New South Wales border. The girls' hands were bound and they were then ordered along a remote bush track over rugged terrain to the creek. After the group walked alongside the creek for several hundred metres, Camilleri ordered the girls to remove their clothing and wash their vaginas thoroughly to remove any evidence of the prior sexual assaults. Afterwards, the girls were then ordered to lie on their stomachs before being retied and gagged. They were then separated by a distance of approximately as Camilleri and Beckett discussed what to do next. Camilleri demanded Beckett drown the girls but Beckett protested, saying it was unfair that he had to kill both. Beckett eventually complied when an argument occurred and Camilleri threatened to stab him if he did not comply. Murder of Lauren Barry Beckett attempted to first drown Barry, who was tied up near the creek. After a struggle, he became angry when his knee became wet. He reached for his knife and stabbed Barry in the neck, accidentally cutting his thumb. Beckett described the scene to police as follows, :\\"I went over to Lauren and dragged her down to the water. I held her head under the water. She was struggling and she knocked me into the water. One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me off a little bit and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in the left side of the neck. I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving.\\" Murder of Nichole Collins Beckett then ran up the embankment towards Collins who was tied to a tree and out of view of Barry who now lay dying in the creek bed. Beckett slashed Collins to the throat several times then began to punch and kick her when he realised she had not died instantly from the knife wounds. :\\"After I stabbed Lauren, I ran up the bank to where I tied Nichole up. She must have heard what I had done to Lauren because when I got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.' I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut her throat two or three times. This was across her throat. The knife was in my left hand. Nichole was sitting down when I cut her throat. :After this she was thrashing around on the ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then I put my foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife all the way in but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her on the left side of the chest. :She still didn't stop moving so I stabbed her in the front of the chest. I was aiming for her heart. I needed two hands to get the knife through her chest. She kept moving so I kicked her in the head a couple of times. She still kept moving but she was slowing down. I waited until she stopped moving which didn't take long.\\" After the murders, Camilleri, who was not present during the murders and was waiting in the car, asked Beckett \\"Did you see the demon?\\". The pair quickly left the crime scene with Beckett driving and returned to New South Wales. =Disposal of evidence= Commonwealth Avenue Bridge over Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra Camilleri drove from the murder scene while Beckett slept in the vehicle, and woke as the pair approached Canberra. They stopped at Theodore Lookout on the Monaro Highway and burned their blood-stained clothing, ropes and gags used to restrain the girls. The pair later threw their knives from the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge into Lake Burley Griffin before returning to their homes in Yass. On 8 October 1997, Camilleri and Beckett drove to Sydney and stayed with Camilleri's brother for several days. While in Campbelltown in Sydney's south- west, they spent six hours cleaning their vehicle at a car wash, going as far as removing the vehicle's seats and carpets to clean them thoroughly. The pair then returned to Canberra to destroy further evidence before returning to Bega on an unsuccessful search for the discarded portable television which Camilleri believed would lead police to them. The television was earlier removed by a local council worker. Arrests On 25 October 1997, police located a car earlier stolen by Beckett in Canberra. Inside the vehicle, police discovered maps of the Bega area and items belonging to Beckett. Members of the Australian Federal Police arrested Beckett on 27 October on car theft charges and remanded him in custody. Police interviewed Camilleri the following day. Both men denied any knowledge of the girls' abduction and murder, and denied discarding a television set by the roadside. However, Camilleri admitted travelling with one that he had dropped at a St. Vincent De Paul store. On 12 November, Beckett made a full confession to police and agreed to guide them to the crime scene at Fiddler's Green Creek, where the remains of the girls' bodies were discovered. Camilleri, who was at this time also remanded in custody for breaching bail conditions, was awaiting trial at Goulburn Correctional Centre. He was again interviewed by police and informed of Beckett's confession. Camilleri again denied any involvement in the murders, implicated Beckett as the lone killer, and insisted he was in a drug- induced stupor for most of the time the girls were in the car, stating: > \\"We picked up the girls and went to the beach. I shot up heroin behind the > shed. While the girls were drinking I was trying to OD. We drove around with > the girls. I was asleep most of the time. Beckett later told me he had > dropped both girls off at home. I remember waking up and seeing the girl. We > were parked in the bush. I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria > on the main road somewhere. I went off my head. I told him to go home, get > the fuck out of here. Then I saw him walking out of the bush. He had blood > all over him. Told me he cut his finger.\\" Police later charged Camilleri and Beckett with multiple counts of abduction, rape and murder. Trials =Leslie Camilleri= The trial of Camilleri began on 15 February 1999 and ran until 10 April. A total of 70 witnesses were called. Prosecution evidence included a shirt belonging to Barry containing semen matching Camilleri's DNA profile. The shirt was discovered at the rubbish dump in Old Wallagoot Road where the pair had first taken the girls. Police recovered evidence from almost every location the pair had taken the girls and assaulted them. Beckett was called to give evidence against his co- accused and spent five days in the witness box. Camilleri continued his claims that he was in a stupor when the girls were with the car, and that he barely remembered them, hoping to lay the entire blame for the murders on his associate Beckett. Camilleri was found guilty by the Supreme Court jury and on 27 April 1999 was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders, never to be released. In sentencing Camilleri to life imprisonment, never to be released, the judge remarked Camilleri was 28 at the time of his crimes and 29 when sentenced. He appeared before the Supreme Court in 2001 to appeal his sentence; the appeal was unsuccessful. He later appealed to the High Court in May 2002,. and again his appeal was dismissed. Camilleri has received numerous death threats from other prisoners and remains in protective custody. =Lindsay Beckett= On 26 June 1998, Lindsay Hoani Beckett, who confessed to the murders, appeared in the Supreme Court of Victoria where he was arraigned and pleaded guilty to the murders of Lauren Barry and Nichole Collins. On 20 August 1998, Beckett was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 35 years. At the time of Beckett's sentencing, his non-parole period was the longest ever given to a Victorian prisoner.\\"Lindsay Hoani Beckett\\" , Accessed 11 October 2001 After sentencing, the mother of one of the schoolgirls yelled to Beckett, \\"I hope you rot in hell\\" as he was led from the courtroom to begin his sentence. Legislative change As a result of this case, the Bail Act 1978 was amended in the Bail Amendment Act 1998 (NSW). p.33 See also * Casefile True Crime Podcast (Prue Bird case) * List of kidnappings * Murder of Anita Cobby * Murder of Janine Balding * Murder of Ebony Simpson * Murder of Virginia Morse * Murder of Sian Kingi References External links *Sensible Sentencing Trust - Offender Databases - Lindsay Hoani Beckett *Casefile True Crime Podcast - Case 25: Prue Bird - 16 July 2016 Category:1997 crimes in Australia Category:History of New South Wales Category:Kidnapped Australian children Category:Murdered Australian children Category:People murdered in Victoria (Australia) Category:Rape in Australia Category:1990s in New South Wales Category:Australian prisoners sentenced to multiple life sentences Category:Female murder victims Category:1990s murders in Australia Category:1997 murders in Oceania ","title":"Bega schoolgirl murders"},{"id":"2987884","text":"The museum (left) on the High Street, Slough Slough Museum is an independent museum in Slough in the English county of Berkshire.

Generally, those whose heads are lower than this line point up while those whose heads are higher point down. In musical notation, stems are the, \\"thin, vertical lines that are directly connected to the [note] head.\\" Stems may point up or down. Different-pointing stems indicate the voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff. Within one voice, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem originates from the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a chord contains a second, the stem runs between the two notes with the higher being placed on the right of the stem and the lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of the stem, while the middle note will be on the wrong side. The length of a stem should be that of an octave on the staff, going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing. If a note head is on a ledger line more than an octave away from the middle line of a staff, the stem will be elongated to touch the middle line. In any polyphonic music in which two parts are written on the same staff, stems are typically shortened to keep the music visually centered upon the staff. right Stems may be altered in various ways to alter the rhythm or other method of performance. For example, a note with diagonal slashes through its stem is played tremolo.

An alternative, and more appropriate, translation would be presence bread,Jewish Encyclopedia since the Bible requires that the bread be constantly in the presence of God (). This is the bread eaten by David as mentioned in () (œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ºÑœÅœÑŒøœÖœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÄœÅŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÉŒµœâœÇ). Biblical references Illustration of the temple priests replacing the showbread each week. Within the Torah, the showbread is mentioned exclusively by the Priestly Code and Holiness Code, but certain sections of the Bible, including the Book of Chronicles, Books of Samuel, and Book of Kings, also describe aspects of them. In the Holiness Code, the showbread is described as twelve cakes/loaves baked from fine flour, arranged in two rows/piles on a table standing before God; each loaf/cake was to contain two omers of flour () (approx 4.9 pounds). The Biblical regulations specify that cups of frankincense were to be placed upon the rows of cakes, and the Septuagint, but not the masoretic text, states that salt was mixed with the frankincense; the frankincense, which the Septuagint refers to as an anamnesis, (a hapax legomenon), constituted a memorial (azkarah), having been offered upon the altar to God (). According to the Book of Chronicles, the Kohathite clan had charge of the baking and setting in order of the bread, suggesting that there were secret extra requirements in preparing the bread, known only to the Kohathites. Since leavened products were prohibited from the altar, and the cakes/loaves are not described as being offered upon it, it is possible that the showbread was leavened; however, as they were carried into the inner part of the sanctuary, it is highly probable that they were unleavened. The cakes were to be left on the table for a week, and then be replaced with new ones on the Sabbath, so that there were always fresh loaves on the table, and those that had started going stale were removed; the Biblical text states that the Jewish priests were entitled to eat the cakes that had been removed, as long as they did so in a holy place, as it considered the bread to be holy. The narrative of David's sojourn at Nob mentions that Ahimelek (the priest) gave David the holy bread, at his request., cf. , =The table (shulchan)= The table or shulchan for the showbread was, according to Biblical regulations, to be placed in the northern part of the sanctuary, opposite the Menorah and with the Altar of Incense between them. The Septuagint translation describes the table as being of solid gold, but the masoretic text states that it was made from acacia wood, and only covered with pure gold, with a gold border around the top; the table's dimensions are given as 2 ells long, 1 ell wide, and 1.5 ells high., The feet of the table are described as having a ring-like enclosure to which four gold rings were fastened, so that rods (made from acacia wood, and covered with gold) could be passed through the rings, and used to make the table portable, in the same manner as the other features of the tabernacle. The biblical text indicates that, when being carried, the table would be covered with a purplish-blue cloth, the loaves and vessels would be placed on the cloth, and another cloth, in scarlet, would be placed over it, with a fine skin being added on top of that. In each sanctuary there was only one table, except for the Temple in Jerusalem, which the Book of Chronicles describes as having ten tables within its Holy Place. Gold utensils ('dishes, cups, bowls, and pitchers for pouring') were provided for the table,Exodus 25:29 and 37:16 suggesting that other food and drink was served on the table as well as the showbread. The King James Version of the Bible states that the utensils are to be 'set in order upon it'. KJV In Solomon's Temple, there was provision made for the proper exhibition of the showbread., cf. , Antiochus Epiphanes plundered the table of showbread from the Second Temple, but under Judas Maccabeus a replacement was made. Origin Although, according to textual scholars, the only source texts among those comprising the Torah which mention the showbread are the Holiness Code and later additions to the priestly source, the antiquity of the practice is shown by its mention in the Books of Samuel et sequentia which textual scholars generally view as predating the priestly source.Jewish Encyclopedia, Books of Samuel In the Books of Samuel, Ahimelek is described as asking for an assurance that David's men were in a ritually pure state, namely that they had not been involved in sexual activity with women, before handing over the old showbread; biblical scholars view this as suggesting that the showbread was originally a sacrificial meal which was viewed as being shared with the deity,Jewish Encyclopedia, showbread hence the need to be ritually pure,cf. , and the bread not being burnt but instead consumed. The custom seems to have been widespread in the region,cf. , , et sequentia, and an example being the Babylonian practice of offering to their gods a number of different kinds of cakes/bread (akalu); the Hebrew term for showbread, Lehem haPanim, is exactly translated by the Assyrian phrase akal p◊ínu, which refers to the Babylonian cake/bread offerings. In the Israelite case, a number of biblical scholars connect the use of showbread directly to the ancient cult of the Ark of the Covenant, the Ark being seen as the home of the deity, and the bread being an offering of food, ready for consumption whenever the deity chose to make an appearance.Stade, Biblical Theology of the Old Testament, (1905), 1:168 Like the biblical showbread, the Babylonians and Assyrians generally laid twelve cakes/loaves, or an integer multiple of twelve cakes/loaves, on tables in front of images of their deities;Peake's commentary on the Bible the number twelve, which is so prominent in the showbread rite, has always borne mysterious religious significance, and with the Assyrian practice of laying out twelve cakes/loaves, was directly connected with the Zodiac. The Babylonian cakes/bread were also required to be sweet (i.e. unleavened), and like the biblical showbread were baked from wheat flour. In classical Jewish literature The somewhat scanty biblical details concerning the showbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, the cakes were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work of any kind during the Sabbath.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, volume 3, 10:7 The Mishnah argues that the loaves were kneaded separately,Menahot 11:1 but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that the loaves were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived more than a thousand years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while the loaves were just dough, another while the bread was being baked in the oven, and a third after baking, to protect the shape.Sifra to Leviticus 24:5-9Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:5:8 The Mishnah describes the loaves as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long;Menahot, 11:4 Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:5:9 According to some Mishnaic contributors, the kneading of the dough was done outside the sanctuary, but the baking was done inside,Men. 11:2 but others state that all the preparations were carried out in the Temple courtyard, and others in the house of Pagi, which according to Maimonides was very close to the Temple courtyard; no reason is given for these geographic distinctions, but the Gemara argues that the House of Garmu were responsible for baking the showbread, and kept their methods and reasoning secret. The Mishnah states that to replace the bread, two priests would enter the sanctuary ahead of another four priests carrying the replacement bread; the two priests without the bread would go to the southern end of the table, while those with the new bread would go to the northern end, and while the priests at the south removed the old bread from the table, it would be replaced with the new bread by the priests at the northern side, so that the bread would always be present.Menahot 99bMaimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:5:4 Josephus states that the cakes were placed in two equal piles (rather than rows),Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, volume 3, 10:7 as does the Mishnah, which describes the existence of hollow golden tubes to carry air between the bread, and two golden fork-shaped supports attached to the table, each one to hold up a pileMenahot 94b, 96aMaimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:5:2 Josephus also states that the frankincense was placed in two golden cups ‚Äì one on top of each pile; the Mishnah states that a handful of incense was placed in each cup, and the Tosefta states that the cups, called bezikin, had flat bottoms/rims, so that they could also be placed on the table.Tosefta on Menahot 11 According to the Mishnah, while the new bread was being carried in by the four priests, two other priests would carry in replacement cups of incense, and two further priests would go ahead of them to remove the old cups of incense. The Mishnah argues that after being removed, the old bread was placed on a golden table in the Temple's hall, and then the old incense would be burnt; once this was done, the cakes would be divided, with the Jewish High Priest getting five of the twelve loaves, and the remainder being divided among the other priests on duty during the previous week.Yoma On the occasion of certain Jewish Holidays occurring during the Sabbath, there were adjustments made, for example, if Yom Kippur occurred on the Sabbath, the old bread wouldn't be divided between the priests until the evening.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:5:5 =The table= The majority of contributors to the Mishnah state that the table was of the same dimensions as the loaves ‚Äì 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was a gap between the piles of showbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions clearly are too small for the loaves to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that the loaves were free standing on the table.Menahot 11:5 The Mishnah states that there were 28 ventilation tubes, 14 for each pile, each of which was open at one end only. The Gemara extrapolates from this the conclusion that the fork-like supports were set into the floor, two at each end of the table, and the tubes went between the fork-like supports above the table. The Gemara essentially has the view that the supports and tubes formed a complex receptacle for the loaves, similar to a grate, with the lowest loaf in each pile resting directly on the table, but with the next loaf resting on the two lowest of the tubes, and so forth up the pile. Presumably a device as complex as this would have been mentioned at least briefly in the Bible had it been a biblical requirement, but it isn't.Josephus, The Jewish Wars, volume 5, 5:5Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, volume 3, 6:6 The table is depicted on the Arch of Titus during the emperors Titus and Vespasian's triumphal procession in 71 CE, which celebrated their defeat of Judea.Michael Pfanner, Der Titusbogen, 1981, pgs. 50-54 As well as the golden cups for the incense, the Mishnah enumerates a number of other dishes (ke'arot) and hand-like bowls (kappot), including menakkiyyot (which were probably for dipping) and kesawot; the kesawot are identified by the Mishnah as being for the wine-libations, but the Targums argue that they were for the purpose of covering the showbread. The Mishnah also suggests that the Table could be dismantled into small portions, so that if any part of it ever became ritually impure, it could be regain its ritual purity by washing the parts in a Mikvah. Among ancient groups There is evidence of Jewish groups around the turn of the common era, such as the Qumran community at the Dead Sea, and the Therapeutae in Egypt, which seem to have regarded themselves as part of the main Jewish body worshipping at the Jerusalem temple, despite being geographically isolated from it, and, in the eyes of later Jewish thought, theologically distinct from it. Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, a number of Aramaic fragments, found in cave 2, discuss eschatological connections to the eating of showbread, which Matthew Black links with the sacred community meal discussed in a scroll from cave 1 (1QSVI), and the Messianic meal discussed in another scroll in the same cave (1QSall);Matthew Black Dead Sea Scrolls, p. 110. Professor Black suggests that the Qumran community may have considered their regular bread sharing to be an enactment of the Sabbath division of showbread at the Jerusalem Temple. There is dispute among scholarly groups as to whether the Qumran community was identifiable with the Essenes, but scholars do generally agree that there was an association between the Essenes and the Therapeutae. Philo reported that the Therapeutae's central meal was intended to emulate the holy table set forth in the sacred hall of the temple,Philo, The contemplative life, 81-82 but though the Qumran community are portrayed in the Dead Sea Scrolls as viewing the Jerusalem service as having failed to achieve priestly holiness, Philo describes the Therapeutae as deliberately introducing slight differences in their practices from those at the Temple, as a mark of respect for the Temple's showbread.

It featured the return of former regular castmember Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher as well as the first of three appearances by Ray Walston as Boothby. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, while visiting Starfleet Cadet Wesley Crusher at Starfleet Academy, the crew learn of an accident that claimed the life of a cadet. Plot The Enterprise returns to Earth, where Captain Picard is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at Starfleet Academy's graduation ceremony. However, the crew comes to learn of an accident during flight training that has injured Wesley Crusher and caused the death of fellow Nova Squadron member Joshua Albert. During the deposition, Nova Squadron leader Nick Locarno testifies that the impact occurred as they were coming out of a \\"Yeager Loop\\" maneuver. He also says that Joshua was nervous about flying, and that he allowed him to fly because he did not want to end his flying career over nerves. He claims that the accident was Joshua's fault, but admits that in hindsight allowing him to fly was a mistake. However, when satellite imagery from seven seconds before the crash shows the squad to be in a different formation than the one they have testified to being in, the cadets remain tight lipped. Picard, concerned that things are not what they seem, orders his crew to investigate the accident. Picard discovers evidence that Wesley's squad was attempting to perform a banned maneuver called the \\"Kolvoord Starburst\\", last attempted at the Academy more than a century previous that resulted in the deaths of all five cadets involved. Picard accosts Wesley and demands to know the truth, but Wesley responds by saying that he chooses to not answer, indicating that an answer would be self-incriminating. Picard reminds him that the first duty of any Starfleet officer is to the truth, scientific, historical and personal; he gives Wesley an ultimatum: either he comes forward with the truth or Picard would present his reasonably credible explanation of the deceptions. Locarno attempts to coerce Wesley into backing up the lie, claiming that Picard has no evidence, thus tearing Wesley between their friendship and their obligations as Starfleet officers. At the hearing, Wesley is forced to choose between considerations of his own value of honesty, Picard's trust in him and consideration of Joshua's father, versus Locarno's claim on his loyalty to Nova Squadron and the impact on each member's career. The Admiral decides, in the absence of conclusive proof of any further wrongdoing, other than rendering an incorrect flight plan and allowing a squad member to fly unprepared, to take away the squad's flight privileges and issue formal reprimands. However, before she can close the hearing, Wesley steps up and reveals the truth behind the accident. Locarno admits that he pressured the squad into performing the banned maneuver, then instigated the lie and pressured the rest of the squad to support it. He is expelled from the Academy, while Wesley and the rest of his colleagues lose their past year's academic credits along with their flight privileges. Wesley is disappointed in himself, but Picard encourages him that while the immediate future will be difficult, he will eventually regain the trust of his classmates and the respect that comes with it. Wes, however, does not believe such is the case. Reception and impact The episode received a warp factor rating of 6/10 from Tor.com. It ranked ninth in Entertainment Weeklys list of top 10 Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes in September 2007. The minor character Sito Jaxa later appeared significantly in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Lower Decks\\", after Picard had requested her assignment to the Enterprise to give her a fair chance to redeem herself. She was ranked as the 86th most important character of Starfleet within the Star Trek science fiction universe by Wired Magazine in 2016. Robert Duncan McNeill's Nicholas Locarno served as the template for the character of Tom Paris on Star Trek: Voyager. Originally, producers were searching for a different actor than McNeill. However, after many auditions it was suggested to simply bring McNeill in to play the part since they were using his character as a model for Tom Paris already.Star Trek The Next Generation DVD set Season 5, Disk 7, \\"Memorable Missions\\" featurette The A.V.

He is best remembered for The Garry Moore Show in the 1950s and Candid Camera, which he co-hosted with Allen Funt from 1961 through 1966. His name is sometimes misspelled \\"Durwood\\". Early life Kirby was born in Covington, Kentucky. His family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, when he was 15. Kirby graduated from Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis, then entered Purdue University to study engineering. However, he dropped out to become a radio announcer. Radio By 1936, Kirby was an announcer for WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1937, an Associated Press news story reported that Kirby \\"made a name for himself\\" with his reporting on the Ohio River flood of 1937. He also worked at radio stations in Chicago and Indianapolis before World War II. He served in the United States Navy during the war. Following the war, Kirby hosted Club Matinee in Chicago with Garry Moore on the NBC Blue radio network before moving to television in 1949 as an announcer. He also worked on Meet Your Navy and Honeymoon in New York on network radio.DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960.

Bottom from left: \\"Joe Dribble\\", \\"Whistler's Mother\\", a Japanese movie star. Kirby was a regular on Moore's television shows from 1950 to 1968. The Associated Press's obituary for Kirby gives his years of working with Moore's television show as 1950-1951, 1958-1964, and 1966-1967. Kirby also appeared as a host, announcer, or guest on other television programs. He served as one of NBC Radio's Monitor \\"Communicators\\". In 1967, Carol Burnett introduced Kirby and his wife, Pax, sitting in the live audience during her opening remarks of season 1 episode 4 of The Carol Burnett Show. In the middle of her opening monologue, Burnett recognized Kirby. Then as the cameras followed, she excitedly ran off stage into the audience to greet Kirby and his wife before returning to complete her monologue. Stage Kirby acted in summer stock theatre, including three years' appearances in productions at the Cherry County Playhouse in Michigan. Other information Kirby was tall and had a mellow personality that served well as a foil for the stars with whom he worked. A versatile performer, he acted in sketches, sang, and danced. He moved with ease from slapstick to suave sales pitches for the sponsor's product. Critic John Crosby called him \\"one of the most versatile muggers and comedians on the air.\\" An embarrassing moment came during a Polaroid commercial, during which he forgot to pull the tab after taking a picture of Garry Moore holding his Christmas list. After nearly a minute of a Polaroid representative yelling, \\"Pull the tab!\\" from the audience, Kirby gave a mighty yank with his long arms and pulled all seven remaining pictures out of the camera. This required a fair amount of strength, not only to burst the developer pods but to rip through the stops on the film roll. Books Kirby wrote three books: My Life, Those Wonderful Years; Bits and Pieces of This and That; and a children's book, Dooley Wilson. Personal life Kirby married Mary Paxton Young on June 15, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois. Paxton was a singer and actress on radio. She died in 1994. They had two sons, Durward Randall (born December 5, 1942) and Dennis Paxton (born June 11, 1949). Death Kirby died of congestive heart failure in Fort Myers, Florida, on March 15, 2000, at the age of 88. He was buried next to his wife, Mary Paxton Young Kirby, in Coburn Cemetery in Fairfield County, Connecticut, where they had a summer home. He was survived by his two sons and three grandsons. Cultural references Kirby's name was spoofed in the animated series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, wherein a man's hat (size 7-5/32) was called the \\"Kirward Derby\\". It supposedly had magic powers that made its wearer the smartest person in the world. Kirby considered suing, but his business manager pointed out that it would only bring more attention to the show. Jay Ward, producer of The Bullwinkle Show, even offered to pay Kirby to sue him; however, he did not pursue any further action. A button reading \\"Durward Kirby for President in '64\\" appears in the January 1964 edition of Mad. In The Mary Tyler Moore Show episode \\"Phyllis Whips Inflation\\" (season 5, episode 114; aired 18 January 1975), the character Phyllis Lindstrom explains that the drop in the price of her Polaroid stock is because the company hired Laurence Olivier to do its television commercials. She says they should have saved money and hired Kirby (a reference to his Polaroid commercial incident). In the movie Pulp Fiction (1994), the character Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) orders a \\"Durward Kirby\\" burger. The eponymous title track on the album Scraps by the band NRBQ includes the line: \\"I know a Melarooney boy named Durward Kirby; I yelled in his ear and wondered if he heard me.\\" Quotes \\"Age is just a number, and mine is unlisted.\\" References External links  Category:1911 births Category:2000 deaths Category:American television personalities Category:People from Covington, Kentucky Category:Purdue University people Category:Radio and television announcers ","title":"Durward Kirby"},{"id":"2987988","text":"HMS Andromache was an protected cruiser of the Royal Navy.

She was present at the Naval Review at Spithead on 26 June 1897 in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. On 28 February 1900, the Andromache and her sister ship Apollo reportedly had been transferred from the Medway to the Devonport Fleet Reserve. With the exception of the previous year's manoeuvres Andromache had been unemployed since being built. On 27 June 1900, orders from Devonport were given for a naval mobilization to take place on Tuesday, 10 July. Commander Francis Alan Richard Bowles was appointed in command on 23 April 1902, and in June that year she was reported to serve as Naval Reserve drill ship at North Shields. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. On 1 February 1908, the torpedo gunboat collided with Andromache in Harwich harbour, and had to be beached to avoid sinking. In September 1909, the ship completed conversion to a minelayer at Chatham Dockyard. Andromache took part in naval exercises off the East coast of Britain in July‚ÄìAugust 1910, but on the night of 1 August, the steamship Neapolitan Prince, employed as a transport during the exercises, collided with Andromache on leaving Harwich harbour, crushing boats and davits on Andromaches starboard side. In August 1914 she joined the Minelayer Squadron, after which she was reduced to harbour duties.

He attracted controversy as his performances by wearing blackface to impersonate an Aboriginal Australian. Beers, a Dutch immigrant to Australia, performed as King Billy since the 1970s. Changing attitudes towards the use of blackface and towards racism in Australia have led to Beers to receive less work in later years. Despite the contents of his performance, Beers denied allegations of racism and claimed to have Aboriginal family members. In July 2002 the Crown Casino cancelled a scheduled Beers performance after receiving complaints from various Aboriginal and other ethnic community groups. In the same month Aboriginal activist John Kelly-Country lodged a complaint against Beers with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. After the Commissioner terminated the complaint in March 2003, Kelly-Country commenced proceedings against Beers in the Federal Magistrates Court in Darwin, claiming that Beers' performance breached Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Amongst the orders sought by Kelly- Country were a prohibition against Beers making recordings or performing live shows, a public apology, financial penalty and compensation for humiliation. Beers successfully represented himself in the case, which ended in May 2004 with the determination that while his performance was offensive, it was exempted under Section 18D of the Act as an artistic works. The case has subsequently been discussed in relation to the operation of the Act and proposed revisions would remove Section 18C.

International publication number WO0042320 and Louis M. Michaud,Michaud's U.S. Patent is US 2004/0112055 A1, \\"Atmospheric Vortex Engine\\" aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure. The AVE induces ground-level vorticity, resulting in a vortex similar to a naturally occurring landspout or waterspout. An Australian experimental atmospheric vortex using smoke as the tracer. Geoffrey Wickham. Michaud's patent claims that the main application is that the air flow through the louvers at the base will drive low-speed air turbines (21), generating twenty percent additional electric power from the heat normally wasted by conventional power plants. That is, the vortex engine's proposed main application is as a \\"bottoming cycle\\" for large power plants that need cooling towers. The application proposed by Louat in his patent claims is to provide a less-expensive alternative to a physical solar updraft tower. In this application, the heat is provided by a large area of ground heated by the sun and covered by a transparent surface that traps hot air, in the manner of a greenhouse. A vortex is created by deflecting vanes set at an angle relative to the tangent of the outer radius of the solar collector. Louat estimated that the minimum diameter of the solar collector would need to be 44+ metres in order to collect \\"useful energy\\". A similar proposal is to eliminate the transparent cover.Atmospheric Vortex Engine This scheme would drive the chimney-vortex with warm seawater or warm air from the ambient surface layer of the earth. In this application, the application strongly resembles a dust devil with an air-turbine in the center. Since 2000, Croatian researchers Ninic and Nizetic (from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture University of Split) have also developed this technology. and patents.Ninic Patent is HRP20000385 (A2), published in 2002, title: \\"SOLAR POWER PLANT INCLUDING A GRAVITATIONAL AIR VORTEX\\" Nizetic Patent is WO2009060245, published in 2009, title: \\"SOLAR POWER PLANT WITH SHORT DIFFUSER\\" The solar research team at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Malaysia, headed by Prof. Hussain H. Al- Kayiem, developed the first experimental prototype of a solar vortex power generation (SVPG) technology that uses solar energy as a heat source. The basic prototype was then subjected to a series of developments and performance enhancements by integration with sensible thermal energy storage (TES) and modification in the design of the vortex generator. The team carried out and published an experimental evaluation, theoretical analysis, and computational simulations of the SVPG and compiled the findings in a book which summarizes the fundamentals of this technology. Theory of operation Conceptual illustration of a vortex engine by Louis Michaud. Diameter 200 m (660 ft.) or greater (applicable primarily to the Michaud patent) Elevation (side) view of an 80 m-wide (260 ft) vortex engine. It's constructed mostly of reinforced concrete. (48) is grade level (the surface of the ground). In operation, the vortex centripetally expels heavier, colder external air (37), and therefore forms a large, low-pressure chimney of hot air (35). It uses about twenty percent of a power-plant's waste heat to drive its air motion. Depending on weather, a large station may create a virtual chimney from 200 m to 15 km high, efficiently venting waste power plant heat into colder upper atmosphere with minimal structure. The vortex is begun by briefly turning on a diffuse heater (83) and electrically driving the turbines (21) as fans. This moves mildly heated air into the vortex arena (2). The air must have only a mild temperature difference because large temperature differences increase mixing with cold ambient air and reduce efficiency. The heat might be from flue gases, turbine exhaust or small natural gas heaters. The air in the arena rises (35). This draws more air (33, 34) through directing louvers (3, 5), which cause a vortex to form (35). In the early stages, external airflow (31) is restricted as little as possible by opening external louvers (25). Most of the heat energy is at first used to start the vortex. In the next stage of start-up, the heater (83) may be turned off and the turbines (21) by-passed by louvers (25). At this time, low-temperature heat from an external powerplant drives the updraft and vortex via a conventional crossway cooling tower (61). As the air leaves the louvers (3, 5) more rapidly, the vortex increases in speed. The air's momentum causes centrifugal forces on the air in the vortex, which reduce pressure in the vortex, narrowing it further. Narrowing further increases the vortex speed as conservation of momentum causes it to spin faster. The speed of spin is set by the speed of the air leaving louvers (33, 34) and the width of the arena (2). A wider arena and faster louver speed cause a faster, tighter vortex. Heated air (33, 34) from the crossway cooling tower (61) enters the concrete vortex arena (2) via two rings of directing louvers (3, 5, height exaggerated for clarity) and rises (35). The upper ring of louvers (5) seals the low-pressure end of the vortex with a thick, relatively high-speed air-curtain (34). This substantially increases the pressure difference between the base of the vortex (33) and the outside air (31). In turn, this increases the efficiency of the power turbines (21). The lower ring of louvers (3) convey large masses of air (33) almost directly into the low-pressure end of the vortex. The lower ring of louvers (3) are crucial to get high mass flows, because air from them (33) spins more slowly, and thus has lower centripetal forces and a higher pressure at the vortex. Air-driven turbines (21) in constrictions at the inlet of the cooling tower (61) drive electric motor-generators. The generators begin to function only in the last stages of start-up, as a strong pressure differential forms between the base of the vortex arena (33) and the outside air (31). At this time, the bypass louvers (25) are closed. The wall (1) and bump (85) retain the base of the vortex (35) in ambient winds by shielding the low-velocity air-motion (33) in the base of the arena, and smoothing turbulent airflow. The height of the wall (1) must be five to thirty times the height of the louvers (3, 5) to retain the vortex in normal wind conditions. To manage safety and wear of the arena (2), the planned maximum speed of the vortex base (33) is near 3 m/s (10 ft/s). The resulting vortex should resemble a large, slow dust-devil of water- mist more than a violent tornado. In uninhabited areas, faster speeds might be permitted so the vortex can survive in faster ambient winds. Most of the unnamed numbered items are a system of internal louvers and water pumps to manage air velocities and heating as the engine starts. Criticism and history In early studies it was not absolutely clear that this could be made workable due to cross-wind disruption of the vortex.Michaud LM (2005) This motivated later studies with wind tunnel empirical validation of the CFD model, which conclude, \\"The full scale simulations subjected to cross wind show that the power generation capacity is not affected by the cross winds.\\"Diwakar Natarajan PhD Thesis Michaud has built a prototype in Utah with colleague Tom Fletcher. Also, according to Michaud's patent application, the design was initially prototyped with a gasoline-powered 50 cm \\"fire-swirl\\". The University of Western Ontario's wind-tunnel laboratory, through a seed investment from OCE's Centre for Energy, is studying the dynamics of a one- metre version of Michaud's vortex engine. PayPal founder Peter Thiel's Breakout Labs sponsored an AVE test with a (2012) $300,000 grant. The preliminary results (2015) for which were reported in The Atlantic.

It is home to approximately 2,500 students, making it the 6th largest high school in Ohio. History The original school was part of the Van Buren Township Schools and was opened in September 1906. The high school was located on Dorothy Lane just west of Far Hills Avenue. In 1922, the original four-room school was too small for the student population and was replaced by a larger building east of the original building on Dorothy Lane. The original four-room school house later became the first Kettering City Hall. As Van Buren Township began to rapidly grow as a desirable Dayton, Ohio suburban location, the new school on Dorothy Lane was quickly filled to capacity. In 1929, a new, modern building was built on Far Hills Avenue at the corner of Storms Road. The 1922 building became Dorothy Lane Elementary School. The cost of the new high school on Far Hills was $300,000 and led to its being called the \\"folly in the country.\\" But it had to be expanded several times to keep pace with growing enrollment. The school mascot and colors were Dragons and purple and white. In 1934, Fairmont Stadium was constructed behind the school as a football and track and field venue for the school team. As interest in Fairmont football grew, a donation from the Foreman family, which had four sons who had been Dragon stars, helped remodel and enlarge the facilities. In 1954, the Village of Kettering, which occupied much of Van Buren Township, became the City of Kettering, one of the fastest growing in the area. The high school on Far Hills could no longer be expanded to house the growing student population. The Kettering Board of Education secured a large tract of land between Far Hills Avenue and Shroyer Road. A seven building campus style high school, the first of its kind in the Midwest, was opened in 1957 as a three-year high-school. The former building became Dwight L. Barnes Junior High School. Today, it is the home of the Kettering Board of Education. Within just a few years, the student enrollment of more than 2,000 was again exceeding the capacity of the new high school. By 1963, a second campus style high school located in the eastern part of the city was opened as Fairmont East High School and the existing school was renamed Fairmont West High School. Fairmont West retained the Dragons mascot and colors, while Fairmont East adopted the Falcons mascot and the colors Columbia blue and red. In the 1970s, the vocational facilities at Fairmont West were expanded as the Kettering Fairmont Career Tech Center. But overall enrollment began to decline in the school district. After 20 years, the Fairmont East campus was converted to a middle school. In the fall of 1983, the consolidated school reopened as Kettering Fairmont High School, with students from both East and West joining as the Fairmont Firebirds, taking the flight of the Falcon and the fire of the Dragon. The new school colors are navy blue, silver and white. In the 1990s, a track and field facility was constructed on vacant land on the campus between Far Hills and Shroyer. Fairmont participated in the Miami Valley League (MVL) and later in the Western Ohio League (WOL). They are now in the Greater Western Ohio Conference. During the 1992/1993 school year, the high school underwent a major reconstruction, turning the seven building campus into one large building. The project added new classrooms, lockers, common areas, and allowed for students to avoid inclement weather between classes. The then 7 buildings were connected with 35 new classrooms and expansion of facilities such as the library/media center, cafeteria and gymnasium. For the first time since the 1940s, the high school was again a four-year high school, from September 1993. In October 2005, the new $8.8 million James S. Trent Gymnasium‚Äînamed for the veteran Kettering educator‚Äîopened. It seats 3,400 (4,400 with folding seats on the floor) and is used not only for the school's indoor sports teams, but for traveling sports tournaments and music acts. The arena ranks as the seventh- largest entertainment venue in Dayton. It rivals Fraze Pavilion, the outdoor amphitheater in Kettering, which has 4,388 seats. Of course, the arena's first function is for the high school. But because residents approved a levy to pay for renovations and additions to almost every building in the school district, the arena also has community aspects such as: * An exercise facility, The Kettering Fitness and Wellness Center * A wellness/physical therapy center operated by Kettering Medical Center * A cafe * A reception and banquet facility For high academic achievements, Fairmont awarded Dragon Bells. A bell tower was built on the campus in 1989 as a gift of the Class of 1989 and named the Kettering Firebird Spirit Bell. The bell is electronically operated and is the last operational bell from the original Deeds Carillon, which was upgraded to 57 bells in 1988. The bells have recently been refurbished are rung for high academic and extracurricular achievement.

A study of the history of the British Isles, each of the 15 episodes allows Schama to examine a particular period and tell of its events in his own style. All the programmes are of 59 minutes' duration and were broadcast over three series, ending 18 June 2002. The series was produced in conjunction with The History Channel and the executive producer was Martin Davidson. The music was composed by John Harle, whose work was augmented by vocal soloists such as Emma Kirkby and Lucie Skeaping. Schama's illustrative presentation was aided by readings from actors, including Lindsay Duncan, Michael Kitchen, Christian Rodska, Samuel West and David Threlfall. Background When Simon Schama was approached by the BBC to make the series, he knew that it would be a big commitment and took a long time to decide whether it was something he wanted to do. He surmised that if he were to take it on, he would want to \\"dive in\\" and be very involved with the production. Besides writing the scripts, which the historian saw as a \\"screenplay\\", he also had input into other aspects, including the choice of locations. He was concerned that even 15 hour-long programmes would not be enough to tell a story of such magnitude. Accordingly, he and the producers determined that to give each king and queen absolute equal coverage was out of the question: \\"That way lies madness,\\" he said. Instead, he worked out the essential themes and stories that demanded to be related.Tempus Fugit documentary from DVD Schama explained why, at the time of its making, it was right to produce another historical documentary on Great Britain. At that moment, he argued, Britain was entering a new phase of its relationship with Europe and the rest of the world, and where it would end up depended a great deal on where it's come from. He stated that the stories needed to be told again and again so that future generations could get a sense of their identity. Furthermore, he believed that Britain's history comprised a number of tales worth telling: > \\"No matter how much you tell them, you never quite know ‚Ä¶ how compelling and > moving they are.\\"Promotional message from DVD =Criticisms= The main criticism of A History of Britain is that it mostly revolves around England and its history, rather than that of Great Britain in its entirety. It has been criticised for giving short shrift to the Celtic inhabitants and civilisation of Great Britain, including England,History News Network: Britain's History ‚Äì The Celtic Version and for including Ireland, even though Ireland is not part of Great Britain (Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom, but not being part of Great Britain, while the Republic of Ireland is an independent and sovereign state). In a BBC interview, Simon Schama stated that rather than designating different periods of screen time to different nations, he focused on the relationships between the different nations, primarily England and Scotland. By the latter episodes, however, all \\"Three Kingdoms\\" are parts of the United Kingdom.

He was the first black deputy U.S. marshal west of the Mississippi River. He worked mostly in Arkansas and the Oklahoma Territory. During his long career, he had on his record more than 3,000 arrests of dangerous criminals, and shot and killed 14 of them in self-defense. Early life Reeves was born into slavery in Crawford County, Arkansas, in 1838. He was named after his grandfather, Bass Washington. Reeves and his family were enslaved by Arkansas state legislator William Steele Reeves. When Bass was eight (about 1846), William Reeves moved to Grayson County, Texas, near Sherman in the Peters Colony. It appears plausible that Reeves kept in bondage by William Steele Reeves's son, Colonel George R. Reeves, who was a sheriff and legislator in Texas, and a one-time Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives until his death from rabies in 1882. When the American Civil War began, George Reeves, Bass‚Äô enslaver, joined the Confederate Army, taking Bass with him. It is unclear how, and exactly when, Bass Reeves left his enslaver, but at some point during the Civil War, he gained his freedom. One account recalls how Bass Reeves and George Reeves had an altercation over a card game. Bass severely beat his enslaver, and fled to the Natives Territory where he lived among the Cherokee, Creeks and Seminoles. Bass stayed with Natives tribes and learned their languages until he was freed by the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, in 1865. As a freedman, Reeves moved to Arkansas and farmed near Van Buren. He married Nellie Jennie from Texas, with whom he had 11 children. Career Reeves and his family farmed until 1875, when Isaac Parker was appointed federal judge for the Natives Territory. Parker appointed James F. Fagan as U.S. marshal, directing him to hire 200 deputy U.S. marshals. Fagan had heard about Reeves, who knew the Territory and could speak several Natives languages. He recruited him as a deputy; Reeves was the first black deputy to serve west of the Mississippi River. Reeves was assigned as a deputy U.S. marshal for the Western District of Arkansas, which had responsibility also for the Native reservation Territory. He served there until 1893. That year he transferred to the Eastern District of Texas in Paris, Texas, for a short while. In 1897, he was transferred again, serving at the Muskogee Federal Court in the Native Territory. Reeves worked for 32 years as a federal peace officer in the Indian Territory, and became one of Judge Parker's most valued deputies. Reeves brought in some of the most dangerous criminals of the time, he was never wounded despite having his hat and belt shot off on separate occasions. In addition to being a marksman with a rifle and revolver, Reeves developed superior detective skills during his long career. When he retired in 1907, Reeves had on his record over 3,000 arrestsfelons. He killed 14 outlaws to defend his life. Reeves had to arrest his own son for murder, Bennie Reeves, who was charged with the murder of his own wife. Deputy Marshal Reeves was disturbed and shaken by the incident, but demanded the responsibility of bringing Bennie to justice. Bennie was eventually tracked and captured, tried, and convicted. He served 20 years atFort Leavenworth in Kansas before being released; he reportedly lived the rest of his life as a model citizen. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Bass Reeves, then 68, became an officer of the Muskogee Police Department. He served for two years before he became ill and retired. Later years and death Reeves was himself once charged with murdering a posse cook. At his trial before Judge Parker. Reeves reported to have shot by mistake while cleaning his gun; he was represented by former United States Attorney W. H. H. Clayton, who was a colleague and friend, and eventually was believed and acquitted, possibly based on his exceptional records. Reeves' health began to fail further after retiring. He died of Bright's disease (nephritis) on January 12, 1910. He was a great-uncle of Paul L. Brady, who became the first black man appointed as a federal administrative law judge in 1972.\\"Judge Paul L.

Legacy * Historian Art Burton stated that Bass Reeves was the inspiration for the character of the Lone Ranger, he makes this argument based on the sheer number of people Reeves arrested without taking any serious injury, coupled with the fact that many of these arrested were incarcerated in the Detroit House of Correction, the same city where the Lone Ranger radio plays were broadcast on WXYZ.

According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 58. At the 2011 census the population of the village remained less than 100. Details are included in the civil parish of Horninghold. The Eye Brook forms the county boundary with Rutland, on the other side of which is Belton-in-Rutland. It is also the boundary between the dioceses of Leicester and Peterborough. The A47 runs east-west between the villages and the Hallaton Road links Allexton with Hallaton. The parish church of St Peter's, Allexton is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The parish has been merged with Hallaton as part of the united benefice with the parishes of East Norton, Tugby, Slawston and Horninghold. St Peter's Church was originally built between 1160 and 1180 but there have been several modifications, including the additions of a tower and side aisles, and a major restoration in 1862 by William Millican. Allexton is a farming parish of around 1000 acres with a mixture of arable, grazing and woodland. The grazing is for sheep and horses and there is an equestrian centre at Allexton Hall. Until the 1920s almost all the houses and land were part of the Allexton Hall estate. The only old houses are the Old Rectory, Bridge House (formerly the Wilson's Arms) and the Cottage. The current Hall was rebuilt in 1902 but there have been other buildings on the site since Tudor times. In the 13th century the Lord lived in a fortalice (a moated manor house) the remains of which lie buried in a field adjacent to the present hall.

The implications for the group with index q = 0 is usually that its dimension -- the number of independent global sections -- coincides with a holomorphic Euler characteristic that can be computed using the Hirzebruch‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem.  The complex analytic case  The statement of Kunihiko Kodaira's result is that if M is a compact K√§hler manifold of complex dimension n, L any holomorphic line bundle on M that is positive, and KM is the canonical line bundle, then ::: H^q(M, K_M\\\\otimes L) = 0 for q > 0. Here K_M\\\\otimes L stands for the tensor product of line bundles. By means of Serre duality, one also obtains the vanishing of H^q(M, L^{\\\\otimes-1}) for q < n. There is a generalisation, the Kodaira‚ÄìNakano vanishing theorem, in which K_M\\\\otimes L\\\\cong\\\\Omega^n(L), where Œ©n(L) denotes the sheaf of holomorphic (n,0)-forms on M with values on L, is replaced by Œ©r(L), the sheaf of holomorphic (r,0)-forms with values on L. Then the cohomology group Hq(M, Œ©r(L)) vanishes whenever q + r > n.  The algebraic case  The Kodaira vanishing theorem can be formulated within the language of algebraic geometry without any reference to transcendental methods such as K√§hler metrics. Positivity of the line bundle L translates into the corresponding invertible sheaf being ample (i.e., some tensor power gives a projective embedding). The algebraic Kodaira‚ÄìAkizuki‚ÄìNakano vanishing theorem is the following statement: : If k is a field of characteristic zero, X is a smooth and projective k-scheme of dimension d, and L is an ample invertible sheaf on X, then ::: H^q(X,L\\\\otimes\\\\Omega^p_{X/k}) = 0 \\\\text{ for } p+q>d, \\\\text{ and} ::: H^q(X,L^{\\\\otimes-1}\\\\otimes\\\\Omega^p_{X/k}) = 0 \\\\text{ for } p+q : where the Œ©p denote the sheaves of relative (algebraic) differential forms (see K√§hler differential). showed that this result does not always hold over fields of characteristic p > 0, and in particular fails for Raynaud surfaces. Until 1987 the only known proof in characteristic zero was however based on the complex analytic proof and the GAGA comparison theorems. However, in 1987 Pierre Deligne and Luc Illusie gave a purely algebraic proof of the vanishing theorem in . Their proof is based on showing that the Hodge‚Äìde Rham spectral sequence for algebraic de Rham cohomology degenerates in degree 1\\\\. This is shown by lifting a corresponding more specific result from characteristic p > 0 ‚Äî the positive-characteristic result does not hold without limitations but can be lifted to provide the full result. Consequences and applications Historically, the Kodaira embedding theorem was derived with the help of the vanishing theorem. With application of Serre duality, the vanishing of various sheaf cohomology groups (usually related to the canonical line bundle) of curves and surfaces help with the classification of complex manifolds, e.g. Enriques‚ÄìKodaira classification.

There is a Church of England primary school, a village hall and, since 2004, an Indian restaurant 'Little India' in a building formerly occupied by the Olde Cock Inn. Also in the area is a tank hangar which houses a large private collection of armoured fighting vehicles and artillery. One of the most famous landmarks of the village is the windmill which can be seen from miles around. The village is home to watercolour painter Peter Welton who opens his studio for painting classes. It is also the birthplace of former Leicester Student Union Speaker and care home magnate, William C ‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù Neal. It also has a cricket team who compete against other teams around the area.

Further, international trade will still occur between two countries having identical preferences and factor endowments (relying on specialization to create a comparative advantage in the production of differentiated goods between the two nations).  Development of the theory  The hypothesis was proposed by economist Staffan Burenstam Linder in 1961An Essay on Trade and Transformation, Staffan Burenstam Linder, Stockholm: Almqvist & Wicksell, 1961. as a possible resolution to the Leontief paradox, which questioned the empirical validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory (H-O). H-O predicts that patterns of international trade will be determined by the relative factor-endowments of different nations. Those with relatively high levels of capital in relation to labor would be expected to produce capital- intensive goods while those with an abundance of labor relative to (immobile) capital would be expected to produce labor-intensive goods. H-O and other theories of factor-endowment based trade had dominated the field of international economics until Leontief performed a study empirically rejecting H-O. In fact, Leontief found that the United States (then the most capital abundant nation) exported primarily labor-intensive goods. Linder proposed an alternative theory of trade that was consistent with Leontief's findings. The Linder hypothesis presents a demand based theory of trade in contrast to the usual supply based theories involving factor endowments. Linder hypothesized that nations with similar demands would develop similar industries. These nations would then trade with each other in similar, but differentiated goods.  Empirical tests  Examinations of the Linder hypothesis have observed a \\"Linder effect\\" consistent with the hypothesis. Econometric tests of the hypothesis usually proxy the demand structure in a country from its per capita income: It is convenient to assume that the closer are the income levels per consumer the closer are the consumer preferences. This means of estimating similar preferences (from income statistics) was first suggested by Linder, and has been used in studies ever since (see: ). (That is, the proportionate demand for each good becomes more similar, for example following Engel's law on food and non-food spending.) Econometric test of the hypothesis has been difficult because countries with similar levels of per capita income are generally located close to each other geographically, and distance is a very important factor in explaining the intensity of trade between two countries. Generally, a Linder effect has been found to be more significant for trade in manufactures than for non-manufactures, and within manufactures the effect is more significant for trade in capital goods than in consumer goods and more significant for differentiated products than for standardized products.Robert C.

Biography  Tels-Paddern Manor where Keyserling was born and where he grew up Keyserling was born at Schloss Tels-Paddern (now in Kalvene parish, Aizpute Municipality, Latvia), Courland Governorate, then part of the Russian Empire. He belonged to the Baltic German family of Keyserlingk and was a nephew of the geologist Alexander Keyserling. He died in Munich, Bavaria. Keyserling's early novels Fr√§ulein Rosa Herz. Eine Kleinstadtliebe (1887) and Die dritte Stiege (1892) were influenced by Naturalism. The later novels are more finely nuanced and less interested in assembling details. He is always interested in the interplay of light and natural objects. His novels and novellas are usually set in the German Baltic provinces, both in the noble houses and gardens and also in the fir forests and the outdoors generally. Most of his novels are suffused with a certain melancholy. They are peopled by minor aristocrats. Sometimes there are contrasting figures from a less exalted class; often this is a \\"child of nature,\\" a person uncorrupted by civilization. Frequently there is a clash of generations. His novellas and novels, after 1902, place Keyserling at the forefront of German literary Impressionism. His essays on general and cultural questions, like his theater plays, are forgotten. Keyserling enjoyed a literary reputation both in Germany and in the United States. His novels, translated into English in the late 1920s, were reviewed by literary critics, particularly in newspapers of record. His works were edited and anthologized for use in language pedagogy, perhaps as much for their accessible style as for their appealing story lines. His language is unusually chaste and concise. Sentences are never very long or complex. A subtle and elegant stylist, Keyserling's narrative is unforgettable for its evocative ambience and \\"feel.\\" His most emblematic work is perhaps F√ºrstinnen (Princesses), only superficially related to the typical German 19th century Schlossroman (the novel set in a castle or manor house). Somehow midway between Ivan Turgenev and Franz Kafka, there is a certain pessimistic kinship between Keyserling and Anton Chekhov.  Works  * Fr√§ulein Rosa Herz.

All worldwide receiving and transmitting sites in the HFGCS system are remotely controlled from Andrews Air Force Base and Grand Forks Air Force Base. Before 1 October 2002 it was known as the Global High Frequency System (GHFS). HFGCS stations tend to operate in the aviation bands clustered around 5, 6, 8 and 11/12 MHz, although other frequencies are in use. The primary HFGCS voice frequencies are 4724.0 kHz, 6712.0 kHz, 6739.0 kHz, 8992.0 kHz, 11175.0 kHz, 13200.0 kHz and 15016.0 kHz. In addition to the HFGCS, U.S. aircraft frequently use Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) HF stations (13927.0 kHz) and Canadian Forces HF stations (11232.0 kHz) to relay messages. Various other discrete frequencies are available, and used, as part of the HFGCS network and are not listed here. Recording of an EAM on the 11175 kHz HFGCS system. One common use for the HFGCS is to place telephone calls from the aircraft in flight by means of the Defense Switched Network (DSN) to an Air Force base to obtain local weather conditions, to arrange for refueling, and to inform the base of the number of passengers and crew. The HFGCS also carries Emergency Action Messages. In addition to EAMs, the HFGCS also carries a few different types of messages. A higher priority code for orders is a Skyking Message, which is a time sensitive message for orders that need immediate attention. Force Direction Messages (FDM's) are also sent through the HFGCS, although it is impossible to tell whether the message is an FDM or just another EAM being read. The sign off 'Colour Bar' is currently being used (2016) at the end of the transmission.

Fran√ßois Samuel Robert Louis Gaussen (25 August 1790 ‚Äì 18 June 1863) was a Swiss Protestant divine. Life Gaussen was born at Geneva. His father, Georg Markus Gaussen, a member of the Council of Two Hundred, was descended from an old Languedoc family which had been scattered at the time of the religious persecutions in France. At the close of his university career at Geneva, Louis was in 1816 appointed pastor of the Swiss Reformed Church at Satigny near Geneva, where he formed a close relationship with J. E. Cell√©rier, who had preceded him in the pastorate, and also with the members of the dissenting congregation at Bourg-de-Four, which, together with the √âglise du t√©moignage, had been formed under the influence of the preaching of James and Robert Haldane in 1817. The Swiss revival was distasteful to the pastors of Geneva (Ven√©rable Compagnie des Pasteurs), and on 7 May 1817 they passed an ordinance hostile to it. As a protest against this ordinance, in 1819 Gaussen published in conjunction with Cellerier a French translation of the Second Helvetic Confession, with a preface expounding the views he had reached upon the nature, use, and necessity of confessions of faith; and in 1830, for having discarded the official catechism of his church as being insufficiently explicit on the divinity of Christ, original sin and the doctrines of grace, he was censured and suspended by his ecclesiastical superiors. In the following year he took part in the formation of a Soci√©t√© Evang√©lique (Evangelische Gesellschaft). When this society contemplated, among other objects, the establishment of a new theological college, he was finally deprived of his charge. After some time devoted to travel in Italy and England, he returned to Geneva and ministered to an independent congregation until 1834, when he joined Merle d'Aubign√© as professor of systematic theology in the college which he had helped to found. This post he continued to occupy until 1857, when he retired from the active duties of the chair. He died at Les Grottes, Geneva, on 18 June 1863. His best-known work, entitled La Th√©opneustie, ou pleine inspiration des saintes √©critures, an elaborate defence of the doctrine of plenary inspiration, was originally published in Paris in 1840, and rapidly gained a wide popularity in France, as also, through translations, in England and America. It was followed in 1860 by a supplementary treatise on the canon (Le Canon des saintes √©critures au double point de vue de la science et de la foi), which, though also popular, has hardly been so widely read. See the article in Herzog-Hauck, Realencyklop√§die (1899).

Wood is best known for his photographs in Liverpool and Merseyside from 1978 to 2001, \\"on the streets, in pubs and clubs, markets, workplaces, parks and football grounds\\" of \\"strangers, mixed with neighbours, family and friends.\\" His work has been published in several books, been widely shown in solo exhibitions and received awards. Life and work Wood was born and brought up in County Mayo in the west of Ireland. He trained as a conceptual painter at Leicester Polytechnic from 1973 to 1976. Extensive viewing of experimental films led him to photography, in which he is self-taught. He has explored a \\"multiplicity of formally divergent themes and quotations\\" with an approach \\"much more fluid than the current conventions of post-Conceptual photography or photojournalism dictate\\". In 1978 Wood moved to Merseyside, and in 2003 to North Wales where he works as a part-time lecturer in photography at Coleg Llandrillo Cymru. Wood photographed mainly in Liverpool and Merseyside from 1978‚Äì to 2001, primarily street photography \\"on the streets, in pubs and clubs, markets, workplaces, parks and football grounds\\" of \\"strangers, mixed with neighbours, family and friends.\\" At the same time he also worked on a long-term study of the landscape in the west of Ireland, North Wales and Merseyside. He has also worked with video on a daily basis since 1988, filming family life. The pictures in Wood's first book and most famous series, Looking For Love (1989), show people up close and personal at the Chelsea Reach disco pub in New Brighton, Merseyside, where he photographed regularly between 1982 and 1985. This was followed by All Zones Off Peak (1998), which is described in The Photobook: A History vol. 2. All Zones Off Peak includes photographs from 18 years of riding the buses of Liverpool during his 1978 to 1996 'bus odyssey'‚Äîthe images selected from about 100,000 negatives. People (1999), and the retrospective book Photie Man (2005), made in collaboration with Irish artist Padraig Timoney, followed. His work is included in the revised edition of Bystander: the History of Street Photography (2001). Wood's first major British show, Men and Women, was at The Photographers' Gallery in London in 2012. His first full UK retrospective was at the National Media Museum in Bradford in 2013. His landscape photographs were exhibited for the first time in 2014. The critic Sean O'Hagan has described Wood as \\"a pioneering colourist\\", \\"a photographer for whom there are no rules\\" with an \\"instinctive approach to photographing people up close and personal\\" and quotes photographer Simon Roberts saying Wood's photographs \\"somehow combine rawness and intimacy in a way that manages to avoid the accusations of voyeurism and intrusion that often dog work of this kind.\\" Phill Coomes of BBC News wrote that \\"wherever they were taken or made, his pictures seem always to have a trace of human existence, and at their centre they are about the lives that pass through the spaces depicted.\\" The New Yorker's photography critic, Vince Aletti, described Wood's style as \\"loose, instinctive and dead-on\\" adding \\"he makes Martin Parr look like a formalist\\".

The causes of philopatry are numerous, but natal philopatry, where animals return to their birthplace to breed, may be the most common. The term derives from the Greek 'home-loving', although in recent years the term has been applied to more than just the animal's birthplace. The word in Greek meaning philo- 'liking' and patra-'fatherland' Recent usage refers to animals returning to the same area to breed despite not being born there, and migratory species that demonstrate site fidelity: reusing stopovers, staging points, and wintering grounds. Some of the known reasons for organisms to be philopatric would be for mating (reproduction), survival, migration, parental care, resources, etc.. In most species of animals, individuals will benefit from living in groups, because depending on the species, individuals are more vulnerable to predation and more likely to have difficulty finding resources and food. Therefore, living in groups increases a species' chances of survival, which correlates to finding resources and reproducing. Again, depending on the species, returning to their birthplace where that particular species occupies that territory is the more favorable option. The birthplaces for these animals serve as a territory for them to return for feeding and refuge, like fish from a coral reef.Edward O. Wilson, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, 1975 In an animal behavior study conducted by Paul Greenwood, overall female mammals are more likely to be philopatric, while male mammals are more likely to disperse. Male birds are more likely to be philopatric, while females are more likely to disperse. Philopatry will favor the evolution of cooperative traits because the direction of sex has consequences from the particular mating system. Breeding-site philopatry One type of philopatry is breeding philopatry, or breeding-site fidelity, and involves an individual, pair, or colony returning to the same location to breed, year after year. Among animals that are largely sedentary, breeding-site philopatry is common. It is advantageous to reuse a breeding site, as there may be territorial competition outside of the individual‚Äôs home range, and since the area evidently meets the requirements of breeding. Such advantages are compounded among species that invest heavily in the construction of a nest or associated courtship area. For example, the megapodes (large, ground-dwelling birds such as the Australian malleefowl, Leipoa ocellata) construct a large mound of vegetation and soil or sand to lay their eggs in. Megapodes often reuse the same mound for many years, only abandoning it when it is damaged beyond repair, or due to disturbance. Nest fidelity is highly beneficial as reproducing is time and energy consuming (malleefowl will tend a mound for five to six months per year). In colonial seabirds, it has been shown that nest fidelity depends on multi-scale information, including the breeding success of the focal breeding pair, the average breeding success of the rest of the colony, and the interaction of these two scales. Breeding fidelity is also well documented among species that migrate or disperse after reaching maturity. Birds, in particular, that disperse as fledglings will take advantage of exceptional navigational skills to return to a previous site. Philopatric individuals exhibit learning behaviour, and do not return to a location in following years if a breeding attempt is unsuccessful. The evolutionary benefits of such learning are evident: individuals that risk searching for a better site will not have lower fitness than those that persist with a poor site. Philopatry is not homogenous within a species, with individuals far more likely to exhibit philopatry if the breeding habitat is isolated. Similarly, non-migratory populations are more likely to be philopatric that those that migrate. In species that exhibit lifelong monogamous pair bonds, even outside of the breeding season, there is no bias in the sex that is philopatric. However, among polygynous species that disperse (including those that find only a single mate per breeding season), there is a much higher rate of breeding-site philopatry in males than females among birds, and the opposite bias among mammals. Many possible explanations for this sex bias have been posited, with the earliest accepted hypothesis attributing the bias to intrasexual competition, and territory choice. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that proposed by Greenwood (1980). Among birds, males invest highly in protecting resources ‚Äì a territory ‚Äì against other males. Over consecutive seasons, a male that returns to the same territory has higher fitness than one that is not philopatric. Females are free to disperse, and assess males. Conversely, in mammals, the predominant mating system is one of matrilineal social organisation. Males generally invest little in the raising of offspring, and compete with each other for mates rather than resources. Thus dispersing can result in reproductive enhancement, as greater access to females is available. On the other hand, the cost of dispersal to females is high, and thus they are philopatric. This hypothesis also applies to natal philopatry, but is primarily concerned with breeding-site fidelity. A more recent hypothesis builds on Greenwood‚Äôs findings, suggesting that parental influence may play a large role. Because birds lay eggs, adult females are at risk of being cuckolded by their daughters, and thus would drive them out. On the other hand, young male mammals pose a threat to their dominant father, and so are driven to disperse while young. Natal philopatry This page discusses the evolutionary reasons for philopatry. For the mechanisms of philopatry, see Natal homing Natal philopatry commonly refers to the return to the area the animal was born in, or to animals remaining in their natal territory. It is a form of breeding- site philopatry. The debate over the evolutionary causes remains unsettled. The outcomes of natal philopatry may be speciation, and, in cases of non- dispersing animals, cooperative breeding. Natal philopatry is the most common form of philopatry in females because it decreases competition for mating and increases the rate of reproduction and a higher survival rate for offspring. Natal philopatry also leads to a kin-structured population, which is when the population is more genetically related than less related between individuals in a species. This can also lead to inbreeding and a higher rate of natural and sexual selection within a population. =Evolutionary causes of philopatry= The exact causes for the evolution of natal philopatry are unknown. Two major hypotheses have been proposed. Shields (1982) suggested that philopatry was a way of ensuring inbreeding, in a hypothesis known as the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis. He argued that, since philopatry leads to the concentration of related individuals in their birth areas, and thus reduced genetic diversity, there must be some advantage to inbreeding ‚Äì otherwise the process would have been evolutionary detrimental and would not be so prevalent. The major beneficial outcome under this hypothesis is the protection of a local gene complex that is finely adapted to the local environment. Another proposed benefit is the reduction the cost of meiosis and recombination events. Under this hypothesis, non-philopatric individuals would be maladapted and over multi-generational time, philopatry within a species could become fixed. Evidence for the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis is found in outbreeding depression. Outbreeding depression involves reduced fitness as a result of random mating, which occurs due to the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes by combining allele that do not cross well with those from a different subpopulation. However, it is important to note that outbreeding depression becomes more detrimental the longer (temporally) that subpopulations have been separated, and that this does hypothesis does not provide an initial mechanism for the evolution of natal philopatry. A second hypothesis explains the evolution of natal philopatry as a method of reducing the high costs of dispersal among offspring. A review of records of natal philopatry among passerine birds found that migrant species showed significantly less site fidelity than sedentary birds. Among migratory species, the cost of dispersal is paid either way. If the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis was correct, the benefits of inbreeding should result in philopatry among all species. Inbreeding depression is a phenomenon whereby deleterious alleles become fixed more easily within an inbreeding population. Inbreeding depression is demonstrably costly and accepted by most scientists as a greater cost than those of outbreeding depression. Within a species, there has also been found to be variation in rates of philopatry, with migratory populations exhibiting low levels of philopatry ‚Äì further suggesting that the ecological cost of dispersal, rather than genetic benefits of either inbreeding or outbreeding, is the driver of natal philopatry. A number of other hypotheses exist. One such is that philopatry is a method, in migratory species, of ensuring that the sexes interact in breeding areas, and that breeding actually occurs. A second is that philopatry provides a much higher chance of breeding success. Strict habitat requirements ‚Äì whether due to a precisely adapted genome or not ‚Äì mean that individuals that return to a site are more familiar with it, and may have more success in either defending it, or locating mates. This hypothesis does not justify whether philopatry is due to an innate behaviour in each individual, or to learning; however it has been shown that, in most species, older individuals show higher site fidelity. Neither of these hypotheses is as widely accepted as the optimal-inbreeding or dispersal hypotheses, but their existence indicates that the evolutionary causes of natal philopatry have still not been conclusively demonstrated. =Consequences of philopatry= Speciation A major outcome of multi- generational natal philopatry is genetic divergence and, ultimately, speciation. Without genetic exchange, geographically and reproductively isolated populations may undergo genetic drift. Such speciation is most evident on islands. For mobile island-breeding animals, finding a new breeding location may be beyond their means. In combination with a small population, as may occur due to recent colonisation, or simply restricted space, genetic drift can occur on shorter timescales than is observable in mainland species. The high levels of endemism on islands have been attributed to these factors. Substantial evidence for speciation due to natal philopatry has been gathered in studies of island-nesting albatross. Genetic difference is most often detected in microsatellites in mitochondrial DNA. Animals that spend much of their time at sea, but which return to land to breed exhibit high levels of natal philopatry and subsequent genetic drift between populations. Many species of albatross do not breed until 6‚Äì16 years of age. Between leaving their birth island, and their return, they fly hundreds of thousands of kilometres. High levels of natal philopatry have been demonstrated via mark- recapture data. For example, more than 99% of Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) in a study returned to exactly the same nest in consecutive years. Such site-specificity can lead to speciation, and has also been observed in the earliest stages of this process. The shy albatross (Thalassarche [cauta] cauta) was shown to have genetic differences in its microsatellites between three breeding colonies located off the coast of Tasmania. The differences are not currently sufficient to propose identifying the populations as distinct species; however divergence is likely to continue without outbreeding. Not all isolated populations will show evidence of genetic drift. Genetic homogeneity can be attributed to one of two explanations, both of which indicate that natal philopatry is not absolute within a species. Firstly, a lack of divergence may be due to founder effects, which explains how individuals that start new populations carry the genes of their source population. If only a short (in evolutionary timescales) period of time has passed, insufficient divergence may have occurred. For example, study of mitochondrial DNA microsatellites found no significant difference between colonies of black-browed albatross (T. melanophrys) on the Falkland Islands and Campbell Island, despite the sites being thousands of kilometres apart. Observational evidence of white-capped albatross (T. [cauta] steadi) making attempts to build nests on a south Atlantic Island, where the species had never been previously recorded, demonstrate that range extension by roaming sub-adult birds is possible. Secondly, there may be sufficient gene exchange as to prevent divergence. For example, isolated (yet geographically close) populations of the Buller‚Äôs albatross (T. bulleri bulleri) have been shown to be genetically similar. This evidence has only recently, for the first time, been supported by mark-recapture data, which showed one bird marked on one of the two breeding islands was nesting on the other island. Due to the dispersal capabilities of albatross, distance between populations does not appear to be a determining factor in divergence. Actual speciation is likely to occur very slowly, as the selective pressures on the animals are the same for the vast majority of their lives, which is spent at sea. Small mutational changes in non-nuclear DNA that become fixed in small populations are likely to be the major driver of speciation. That there is minimal structural morphological difference between the genetically distinct populations is evidence for random genetic drift, rather than directional evolution due to natural selective pressure. Speciation through natal philopatry is a self-reinforcing process. Once genetic differences are sufficient, different species may be unable to interbreed to produce viable offspring. As a result, breeding could not occur anywhere except natal island, strengthening philopatry and ultimately leading to even greater genetic divergence. Cooperative breeding Philopatric species that do not migrate may evolve to breed cooperatively. Kin selection, of which cooperative breeding is a form, explains how individual offspring provide care for further offspring produced by their relatives. Animals that are philopatric to birthsites have increased association with family members, and, in situations where inclusive fitness is increased through cooperative breeding, may evolve such behaviour, as it will incur evolutionary benefits to families that do. Inclusive fitness is the sum of all direct and indirect fitness, where direct fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through producing offspring. Indirect fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through aiding related individuals offspring. Cooperative breeding is a hierarchical social system characterized by a dominant breeding pair surrounded by subordinate helpers. The dominant breeding pair and their helpers experience costs and benefits from using this system. Costs for helpers include a fitness reduction, increased territory defense, offspring guarding and an increased cost of growth. Benefits for helpers include a reduced chance of predation, increased foraging time, territory inheritance, increased environmental conditions and an inclusive fitness. For the breeding pair, costs include increased mate guarding and suppression of subordinate mating. Breeders receive benefits as reductions in offspring care and territory maintenance. Their primary benefit is an increased reproductive rate and survival. Cooperative breeding causes the reproductive success of all sexually mature adults to be skewed towards one mating pair. This means the reproductive fitness of the group is held within a select few breeding members and helpers have little to no reproductive fitness. With this system, breeders gain an increased reproductive, while helpers gain an increased inclusive fitness. Cooperative breeding, like speciation, can become a self-reinforcing process for a species. If the fitness benefits result in higher inclusive fitness of a family than the fitness of a non-cooperative family, the trait will eventually become fixed in the population. Over time, this may lead to the evolution of obligate cooperative breeding, as exhibited by the Australian mudnesters and Australo-Papuan babblers. Obligate cooperative breeding requires natally philopatric offspring to assist in raising offspring ‚Äì breeding is unsuccessful without such help. Other variations Migrating animals also exhibit philopatry to certain important areas on their route; staging areas, stop-overs, molting areas and wintering grounds. Philopatry is generally believed to help maintain the adaptation of a population to a very specific environment (i.e., if a set of genes has evolved in a specific area, individuals that fail to return to that area may do poorly elsewhere, so natural selection will favor those who exhibit fidelity). The level of philopatry varies within migratory families and species. The term is sometimes also applied to animals that live in nests but do not remain in them during an unfavorable season (e.g., the winter in the temperate zone, or the dry season in the tropics), and leave to find hiding places nearby to pass the inactive period (common in various bees and wasps); this is not migration in the usual sense, as the location of the hiding place is effectively random and unique (never located or revisited except by accident), though the navigation skills required to relocate the old nest site may be similar to those of migrating animals.

It is responsible for a series of six major tephra layers in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska. Hayes was mostly destroyed by at least six catastrophic eruptions between 3,400 and 3,800 years ago, and the average volume of these eruptions was 2.4 cubic km. In comparison, the volume of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was about 1 cubic km. The eruptions of Hayes Volcano during that time were the most voluminous Holocene eruptions to have occurred in the Cook Inlet region. There is currently no fumarolic activity present. The last eruption of Hayes Volcano occurred roughly 1,200 years ago. It is named after the adjacent Hayes Glacier.  Physical setting  Hayes Volcano is an ice-shrouded, glacially scoured eruptive center of Quaternary age composed of pyroclastic deposits, volcanic breccia, and lava domes. Although the edifice of the volcano is largely covered by glacier ice, parts of small lava domes, dome debris, and pyroclastic deposits project through the ice at altitudes of 2,400 to 2,800 meters above sea level. The volcano is nestled within the Tordrillo Mountains, a rugged, glacier-clad mountain range, between the Alaska Range and Cook Inlet, that is composed primarily of older plutonic igneous rocks. Most of the area is in high relief (greater than 1,500 meters) and supports an extensive complex of glacier ice that covers most of the mountainous terrain. The volume of perennial snow and glacier ice on Hayes Volcano is not known but is comparable to the ice volume present on Mount Spurr volcano (to the south), which supports about 67 km¬≥ of ice and perennial snow. Unlike the other volcanoes in the Cook Inlet area, Hayes Volcano lacks a well-defined cone, and deposits from eruptions older than the 4,400-to-3,600-year-old eruption are not known. The volcano is unusual in this regard because all other volcanoes in the Cook Inlet area consist of relatively voluminous assemblages of volcanic rock and debris that formed over many tens of thousands of years.  Historical eruptions  Historical eruptions of Hayes Volcano are not known and evidence of recent eruptive activity is not apparent on the volcano. During trips to the volcano in 1999 and 2000, signs of volcanic unrest, such as melting of glacier ice, steaming, or discoloration of the ice surface by volcanic ash were not observed.

An HRA is not truly an account, since it does not place funds under a separate legal title. Instead, it is an agreement under which the employee can submit qualified health expenses to the employer for reimbursement. Following implementation of the Affordable Care Act, HRAs must be integrated with a qualified employer-sponsored group health insurance plan to avoid excise tax penalties. Using a Health Reimbursement Arrangement yields \\"tax advantages to offset health care costs\\" for both employees and employers.Internal Revenue Service. 2012. QSEHRA In 2016, qualified small employer HRA (QSEHRA) were created which allows small employers to pay for premiums, including on the individual market such as through a health insurance marketplace, although the employees may not be eligible for subsidies. On average, employers with these plans offered an average $387 per month. ICHRA In January 2020, a new type of HRA will be available to businesses of all sizes that allows an employer to scale its benefits across nine different classes. This new tax-advantaged tool is called an ICHRA (Individual Coverage HRA) and will bring greater flexibility in design, expand upon the benefits that its predecessor, the QSEHRA, offered, and present a potential solution to the issue of premium tax credits and HRA benefits that QSEHRAs posed. An ICHRA allows employers to reimburse their employees tax-free for individual insurance and medical expenses. No more hassling with renewals, participation rates, stressing about doctor networks, or getting constant annual increases‚Äîjust decide which benefits go to which classes of employees, set monthly allowance for each, and it's done. Employees get to choose any plan they want and flexible design criteria allows employers to customize their ICHRAs to suit their needs. Further, an ICHRA allows for applicable large employers (ALEs), when the ICHRA is deemed affordable for minimum value coverage, to meet the PPACA employer mandates. Establishment Health Reimbursement Arrangements are funded solely by the employer; they cannot be funded through employee salary deductions. The employer sets the parameters for the Health Reimbursement Accounts, and unused dollars remain with the employer: they do not follow the employee to new employment. Contributions Health Reimbursement Accounts are notional accounts; no funds are expensed until reimbursements are paid. By health reimbursement arrangements, employers reimburse employees directly only after the employees incur approved medical expenses. According to the IRS, an HRA \\"must be funded solely by an employer. Contributions cannot be paid through a salary reduction agreement (such as a cafeteria plan). There is no minimum or maximum contribution limit on the employer's contributions to an HRA. Distributions According to the IRS, employees are reimbursed tax-free for qualified medical expenses up to a maximum amount for a coverage period. HRAs reimburse only items (co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, and services) agreed to by the employer that are not covered by the employer's selected standard insurance plan (any health insurance plan, not only a High Deductible Health Plan). The arrangements are described in IRC Section 105. With an HRA, employers fund individual reimbursement accounts for their employees and define what those funds can be used for, specified out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. Qualified claims must be described in the HRA plan document at inception: before reimbursing employees for the medical expenses. Arrangements (medical services, dental services, co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, participation) may vary from plan to plan, and an employer may have multiple plans in place, allowing much flexibility. The kinds of expenses that can be paid under an HRA are generally the same as the expenses that can be paid through a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). The employer is not required to prepay into a fund for reimbursements. Instead, the employer reimburses employee claims as they occur. Reimbursements under an HRA can be made to the following persons: # Current and former employees. # Spouses and dependents of those employees. # Any person the employee could have claimed as a dependent on the employee's return unless: ## The person filed a joint return, ## The person had gross income of $3,400 or more, or ## The employee or spouse, if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. # Spouses and dependents of deceased employees. Advantages Advantages of HRAs for employers include: * Reimbursements of qualified claims are tax-deductible for the employer. * Employers know their maximum expense related to their health care benefit. Advantages of HRAs for employees include: * Contributions that employers make can be excluded from employees' gross income (contributions must be made by the employer, not come from payroll reductions). * Reimbursements may be tax free if the employee pays qualified medical expenses. * Unused funds in the HRA can be rolled into future years for reimbursement. * HRAs may be offered in conjunction with other employer- provided health benefits, including Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). * Employees can be reimbursed for a health care plan that meets their or their families' specific needs, as opposed to a standard company plan. Disadvantages A frequent complaint regarding HRA arrangements is that they are extremely opaque in regards to their requirements. HRAs must follow \\"a variety of statutory rules and provisions\\" including the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, ERISA, and HIPAA. HRA plans are considered \\"Primary Payers\\" subject to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) mandatory reporting requirements. There are significant penalties for failure to comply with the MSP reporting requirements. Although the MSP reporting requirements began to apply to certain group health plans on January 1, 2009, CMS has delayed mandatory reporting for HRAs.Employee Benefits Institute of America 7/7/2009 Rules pertaining to their reimbursements are perceived by member participants to be somewhat contradictory and/or even incoherent, leading some to lose contributions intended for healthcare but later (after the procedure or laboratory test) to be disallowed. Other disadvantages of HRAs include: * Self-employed persons are usually ineligible. * \\"Highly compensated\\" participants may be subject to \\"certain limitations.\\" A sole proprietor can employ a spouse who actually helps the business. The employer would need to establish a W-2 to make the spouse's employment legitimate. The health care can be run through the business and save the family, on average, $3,000 each year. As small businesses look to reduce costs, especially medical, the HRA can be a great tool that has been used by all too few since the 1954 tax law. HRAs are treated as group health plans and subject to the Medicare secondary payment (MSP). HRAs are subject to the provisions regardless of whether or not they have an end-of-year carry-over feature. Standalone HRAs not offered in conjunction with a High Deductible Health Plan are subjected to restrictions starting in 2014. The law now essentially bans the existence of most such HRAs, as a health plan with maximum benefit limit.

(Shipwreckers! in North America) is a top-down adventure game, released by Psygnosis for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in October 1997. It employs a lighthearted, all ages piratical theme. A relatively low- key release for Psygnosis, the game was met with mixed reviews. Gameplay The player controls a pirate ship, shown to be manned by three pirates in cutscenes. In gameplay, when the ship catches on fire the men jump overboard until the lifebar becomes empty. The game is sometimes referred to as a strategy game, but it is primarily an adventure game. Overboard! also features a multiplayer mode for up to five players (requires the multitap adapter) in which the opponents compete to sink other players‚Äô ships. Reception Overboard! received mixed reviews, with its release during a holiday season crowded with highly-rated big budget titles working against it. Next Generation stated that \\"Ultimately, Shipwreckers! is a fun, quirky title with occasional moments of brilliance. However, with so many other great games out right now, it falls a little short of the mark.\\" Similarly, IGN concluded that \\"Shipwreckers! isn't a bad game. The control is solid and the graphics clean, if a bit dated. But with so many other great games out this holiday season (many of them from Psygnosis, actually) there's just no reason to blow $50 on this one.\\" On the more positive side, GamePro, while unimpressed by the graphics and sound, recommended the game based on the change of pace offered by its unique gameplay. Critics overwhelmingly praised the originality of the game's design, though Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) said it was similar to, and inferior to, the 1993 game The Lost Vikings, and GameSpot compared it unfavorably to Sid Meier's Pirates!. GameSpot nonetheless deemed it solid enough to be worth buying, though their separate review for the PlayStation version was negative, saying the lack of variety and depth in the gameplay makes it grow old over the course of the single-player campaign, a criticism shared by a number of reviewers. However, some reviewers said that the multiplayer mode is the game's strong point, turning it into an intense and addictive party game. Though the graphics as a whole met a mixed response, most critics admitted to being impressed with the transparency effects on the water. Reviewers for both GamePro and EGM found the music annoying and run-of- the-mill, though like GamePro, Kraig Kujawa and Shawn Smith both recommended the game, with Kujawa calling it \\"a cute and original game whose simple play mechanics make it very appealing.\\" Their co-reviewers Crispin Boyer and Kelly Rickards were less enthusiastic, saying that the multiplayer mode makes it worth getting but players should not expect enjoyment out of the single-player mode.

It is just off the A47, nine miles east of Leicester. The Billesdon bypass opened in October 1986. Nearby places include Houghton on the Hill, Skeffington, Tilton on the Hill, and Gaulby. The Billesdon Brook flows through the village. Billesdon was formerly the seat of Billesdon Rural District, which was merged into the Harborough district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. History An earthwork just below the crest on the south side of Life Hill may be a promontory fort. Domesday Book enumerated 25 people here in 1086. The number of households grew substantially between 1563 and 1670, from 38 to 134. In 1851 the village had 1,085 residents. Bricks and stockings were once manufactured here. By the 20th century Billesdon had reverted to an agricultural village. The population declined to 543 by 1931. The population of the parish in 2011 was 901. Two fairs, annually on 23 April and 25 July, and a weekly Friday market, were granted in 1618. The market was held on the green, where Front Street meets the main road, and the base and shaft of the former market cross can still be seen. The market and one fair had been discontinued by the end of the 18th century, but one annual fair remained, and was noted for the sale of brass, pewter and toys. Cattle fairs were held from 1846 until the early years of the 20th century. The fields were inclosed in 1764. Land tax records of the 18th and 19th centuries give the impression of a village of smaller landholders. The Quorn and Fernie hunts had stables in the village. There was a parish workhouse in the village by 1776. Billesdon became the centre of a new poor law union in 1835, and a new workhouse at the west of the village, with an entrance from Coplow Lane opened in 1846. The building became a military hospital in the First World War. The Old School The old school, which still stands in the village, was erected by William Sharpe of Rolleston as a free school for the parish. It was also used for vestry meetings. The National School and master's house were built in 1875. Amenities Billesdon has several amenities including two public houses: the Queens Head, situated on Church Street, and The New Greyhound Inn, situated in the Market Place. There is also a village shop, a hairdresser and a doctors' surgery. On Church Street there is a post office. There is a mobile butcher and a mobile fishmonger who each visit once a week. A mobile chip shop visits twice a week. There is a fire station. The Coplow Centre is Billesdon's own leisure centre featuring multi purpose sports area and a concert hall. The Centre has various events taking place throughout the year such as drama productions, entertainment evenings, sports, etc. The church is St John the Baptist. There is an FM transmitter on Life Hill close to Tilton on the Hill at Lord Morton's Covert wood at Sludge Hall. The parish church, and religious nonconformity Billesdon Church, with ridge and furrow in foreground There was a church here by 1162, which had been given to Leicester Abbey by William de Syfrewast. The present Church of England ironstone building, on Church Street near the junction with Brook Lane, is dedicated to St. John the Baptist and comprises a nave, north and south aisles, chancel, tower and spire. The base of the tower and the north wall of the arcade were probably both built before 1250; the upper stages of the tower and the spire are from the later 13th-century; the north aisle may have been rebuilt in the 14th century; the chancel was rebuilt in the 15th century. When John Throsby visited in 1790 he found the 'principal aisle' was 'crowded with two shabby galleries, not unlike two large pigeon boxes stuck against a wall'. The south aisle was built in 1864, when traces of an earlier south aisle were found, which no one then alive could remember. The old box pews, galleries and high pulpit were taken away in 1864, when the church was restored. Very detailed arrangements were agreed for the payment of tithes to the vicar in the 17th and 18th centuries, including that he was entitled to the tithes of corn and hay on enclosed land only if the closes showed no signs of ridge and furrow. The present vicar of Billesdon parish church is responsible for other nearby parish churches including those of Goadby and Noseley. =Non-conformity= The earliest record of Protestant nonconformity is from 1719. A General Baptist chapel was built in 1812. A congregation of Particular Baptists formed in 1820. The Salem Chapel in West Lane was built in 1846 for the Particular Baptists and the Independents. A Wesleyan Chapel was built by 1854.

He was descended from the judge and legal scholar, Thomas de Littleton. His father, also Edward, had been Chief Justice of North Wales before him.Brooks (2004), ODNB Education and career He was educated at Oxford before becoming a lawyer. In 1614 he became an MP for Bishop's Castle, Shropshire in the Addled Parliament. In 1625 he was again returned to Parliament for Leominster and Caernarfon borough. In 1628 he was chairman of the Committee of Grievances upon whose report the Petition of Right was based. As a member of the party opposed to the arbitrary measures of Charles I, Littleton had shown more moderation than some of his colleagues, and in 1634, three years after he had been chosen Recorder of London, the king attached him to his own side by appointing him Solicitor General. In the famous case about ship money, Sir Edward argued against John Hampden. In 1640, he was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The Great Seal An 18th century mezzotint of Littleton, after Van Dyck In 1641, when the previous keeper, John Finch, fled into exile, Littleton was appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Lyttelton. As the Lord Keeper Littleton had begun to display a certain amount of indifference to the royal cause. In January 1642, he refused to put the Great Seal to the proclamation for the arrest of five members and he also incurred the displeasure of Charles by voting for the Militia ordinance. However, he assured his friend Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, that he had only taken this step to allay the suspicions of the parliamentary party who contemplated depriving him of the seal, and he undertook to send this to the King. He fulfilled his promise, and in May 1642, he himself joined Charles at York, but it was some time before he regained the favour of the king and the custody of the seal. Death Littleton died at Oxford on 27 August 1645; he left no sons and his barony became extinct. His only daughter, Anne, married her cousin, Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet. Their son, Sir Thomas Littleton (c. 1647-1710), was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1698 to 1700, and Treasurer of the Navy from 1700 to 1710. Notes References *Christopher W.

In 1948, he was sold as a 14-year-old horse to the United States of America for 13,000 guineas to Mr W.J. Smith, who later resold him to Messrs. Bing Crosby and Lin Howard. Ajax did not meet with the same stud success in America that he had in Australia, but he did sire Avracado $71,813, Trebor Yug $19,420, and A. Jaxson $11,444.

The palace is surrounded by a park with a palm house (no longer in use). The residence was known for its remarkable fine arts collection, including paintings by da Vinci, Caravaggio, Rubens and del Sarto. The palace belonged to the Tyszkiewicz family until the end of World War I, when it was converted into a shelter for children. It suffered damage during World War II and was rebuilt only in 1959‚Äì1973. Currently it houses collections devoted to the Tyszkiewicz family and Juozas Naujalis.

Congress originally passed domestic source restrictions as part of the 1941 Fifth Supplemental DOD Appropriations Act in order to protect the domestic industrial base in the time of war. History The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) was amended to include exceptions for the acquisition of food, specialty metals, and hand or measuring tools when needed to support contingency operations or when the use of other-than-competitive procedures is based on an unusual and compelling urgency. The specialty metals provision was added in 1973. This provision requires that specialty metals incorporated in products delivered under DOD contracts be melted in the United States or a ‚Äúqualifying country‚Äù. Specialty metals include certain steel, titanium, zirconium and other metal alloys that are important to the DOD. On April 10, 2007, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics determined that most compliant fasteners could not be obtained in sufficient quantity without unreasonably delaying production, and exempted most fasteners from the requirement.https://web.archive.org/web/20070429082852/http://guidebook.dcma.mil/225/dc07-159.htm Congress has since revised the Berry Amendment in the Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Acts. The revised statute now includes exemptions for certain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items, a de minimis exception for small amounts of non-domestic metal (excluding high- performance magnets), a market basket approach to measuring the amount of domestic metal content in articles delivered to DOD, and a national security waiver to prevent the delay in delivery of critically needed systems to troops in combat. Additionally, the blanket exemption for fasteners was removed by Congress, now requiring that at least 50% of commercial fastener specialty metal content be domestic. Finally, Congress required that all waivers or Domestic Non-Availability Determinations (DNADs) be reviewed and revised to comply with the amended law. The original 10 U.S.C. 2533a now excludes specialty metals and applies generally to textile materials. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1), passed by both houses of Congress on February 13, 2009, included legislation offered by Congressman Larry Kissell (D-NC) mandating that any textile and apparel products contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) be manufactured in the United States with 100 percent U.S. inputs. The \\"Kissell Amendment\\" was modeled on and picks up, with little or no modification, many of the specific provisions of the Berry Amendment. Naming The Berry Amendment was named for Ellis Yarnal Berry, who was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1951 - 1971. During his first term in congress, Berry introduced an amendment to the Buy American Act to expand the law to cover all clothing, cotton, and wool. Ever since 1952 any restrictions in the annual Defense Appropriation Acts became known as Berry Amendments. The Berry Amendment became permanent in 1994 by section 8005 of Public Law (Pub.

Today's user interfaces (UIs) are complex software components, which play an essential role in the usability of an application. The development of UIs requires therefore, not only guidelines and best practice reports, but also a development process including the elaboration of visual models and a standardized notation for this visualization. The term user interface modeling is mostly used in an information technology context. A user interface model is a representation of how the end user(s) interact with a computer program or another device and also how the system responds. The modeling task is then to show all the \\"directly experienced aspects of a thing or device\\" [Tr√¶tteberg2002]. Modeling user interfaces is a well-established discipline in its own right. For example, modeling techniques can describe interaction objects, tasks, and lower-level dialogs in user interfaces. Using models as part of user interface development can help capture user requirements, avoid premature commitment to specific layouts and widgets, and make the relationships between an interface‚Äôs different parts and their roles explicit. [SilvaPaton2003].  Languages  =MARIA= MARIA XML (Model-based lAnguage foR Interactive Applications) is a universal, declarative, multiple abstraction level, XML-based user interface markup language for modelling interactive applications in ubiquitous environments. =UML= Some aspects of user interface modeling can be realized using UML. However, the language is not mainly intended for this kind of modeling, which may render the models somewhat synthetic. =UMLi= UMLi is an extension of UML, and adds support for representation commonly occurring in user interfaces. Because application models in UML describe few aspects of user interfaces, and because the model- based user interface development environments (MB-UIDE) lack ability for modeling applications, the University of Manchester started the research project UMLi in 1998. UMLi aims to address this problem of designing and implementing user interfaces using a combination of UML and MB-UIDE. =UsiXML= UsiXML (USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language) is an XML- based specification language for user interface design. It supports the description of UI for multiple contexts of use such as Character User Interfaces (CUIs), Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), Auditory User Interfaces, and Multimodal User Interfaces. =DiaMODL= DiaMODL combines a dataflow- oriented language (Pisa interactor abstraction) with UML Statecharts which has focus on behavior. It is capable of modeling the dataflow as well as the behavior of interaction objects. It may be used for documenting the function and structure of concrete user interfaces. =Himalia= Himalia combines the Hypermedia Models with the control/composite paradigm. It is a full user interface language, it may be used for specifying but also for running it, because of this the designer tool can categorized as a guilder.  Model types  The different aspects of a user interface requires different model types. Some of the models that may be considered for UI-modeling are: * Domain model, including data model (defines the objects that a user can view, access and manipulate through the user interface) * Navigation model, defines how the objects that a user view could be navigated through the user interface * Task model. (describes the tasks an end user performs and dictates what interaction capabilities must be designed) * User model (represents the different characteristics of end users and the roles they are playing within the organization) * Platform model (used to model the physical devices that are intended to host the application and how they interact with each other) * Dialogue model (how users can interact with the objects presentation (as push buttons, commands, etc.), with interaction media (as voice input, touch screen, etc.) and the reactions that the user interface communicates via these objects) * Presentation model (application appearance, representation of the visual, haptic and auditory elements that the user interface offers to its users) * Application model (commands and data the application provides) UML can be used for several of the models mentioned above with varying degree of success, but it lacks support for user modeling, platform modeling and presentation model.  Approaches  There exist several approaches to modeling a user interface. =Usage-centered design= In usage-centered design, the modeling task is to show how the actual presentation of a planned system and how the user interaction is supposed to happen. This is probably the most praised approach, and it has been used successfully on a variety of small and large-scale projects. Its strengths are in complex problems.  Alternative approaches to model-based UIs  The know issue of model-based approaches is information restatement and lack of mechanisms effectively to solve cross-cutting concerns [Cerny2013]. Model-based solution work well on their own, but integration with alternative approaches bring complexity in development and maintenance efforts. =Code-inspection based= These approaches bases on existing general purpose language (GPL) code base [Cerny2012]. They inspect the code through meta-programming and assemble a structural model that is transformed to the UI. This approach addresses information restatement. These approaches does not fit to adaptive and context-aware UIs. =Generative programming= These approaches connect domain methods with GPL [Generative programming]. They address cross-cutting concerns although only at compile-time, which does not fit to future adaptive UIs that need runtime information. =Aspect-based UIs= Aspect-based solution suggested by [Cerny2013][Cerny2013a][AspectFaces] integrates advantages of code-inspection based and generative programming approaches. It inspects existing code and applies aspect oriented methods to address cross- cutting concerns. It works at runtime, reduces information restatement and at the same time separates UI concerns which allows to reuse each independent of others. In the study at [Cerny2013] authors reduce UI code by 32% through aspect-based UI approach applied to a production system. Main advantages are templating for adjusting the presentation, separate definitions of concerns and mostly generic transformation rules applicable across various data. =Content models= Models of this kind show the contents of a user interface and its different components. Aesthetics and behavior details are not included in this kind of models as it is in usage-centered design models.

Many countries have patches made to resemble their flag for use in their militaries, although it is not uncommon for them to also be used for personnel in civil jobs (police officers, civilian pilots, bus drivers, astronauts, etc.), as well as sports teams who include the flag patch of the country they represent in their uniform. Some countries, for instance the United States, have versions of their flag patch made in different color schemes in order to better blend in with their military camouflage. The three most common alternate color schemes are urban (black/silver, pictured), desert (tan/brown), and woodland (black/olive drab). Flag patches are usually sewn onto bags or clothes. There is a fashion among backpackers to buy flag patches in the places where they go and keep them as souvenirs, or to show their origin.

The concept, as articulated in James Brian Quinn's seminal book Intelligent Enterprise (Free Press, 1992) posits that intellect is the core resource in producing and delivering services. The book describes the management approach and computing infrastructure needed to harness that intellect effectively. This approach is referred to in business jargon as Knowledge Management, of which Quinn was an important proponent. Quinn was the William and Josephine Buchanan Professor of Management at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College.

With the help of Penny Paquette and Ms Patricia Higgins, Quinn began data studies and interviews ‚Äì mainly involving careers of advanced technology users in major service industries. Quinn found that there was a definite connection between technology and business and highlighted these results in journals including Scientific American, Harvard Business Review and Sloan Management Review (Academy of Management, 2014). Academy of Management (2014) Executive overview: Intelligent Enterprise by James Brian Quinn, Available at: http://amp.aom.org/content/6/4/48.short (Accessed: 21 October 2014) From there, the book ‚ÄòIntelligent Enterprise‚Äô was written ‚Äì integrating service economy with innumerable technology. Profoundly explaining the use of technology in enterprise and that of which manages work not only within an enterprise but also between enterprises. However, in order for technologic enterprise to be successful the intelligence of strategic processes acted out by human services is required. Quinn highlights that in advanced industrial countries, the importance of technology in the service industry or manufacturing one will be the key to prosperity and productivity. He supposes that the organisation of enterprises depends more on intellectual resources rather than management of physical assets. The Paradigm This paradigm highlights that in today‚Äôs world, highly intelligent systems is the key to expanding industry, however, in order to do so - the organisational set up is required. These knowledge based services and technology are revolutionising the economy. Organisational set up includes \\"autonomous problem solving, intelligently seeking solutions and taking whatever action is required\\" (Thannhuber, 2004).Markus J. Thannhuber (2004 ) The Intelligent Enterprise: Theoretical Concepts and Practical Implications, Germany : Physica-Verlag Heidalberg Quinn continues to highlight the way in which managers should approach running their businesses. This includes a rewarding work environment, low friction and energising within the company (Quinn, 1992). By outsourcing the less core functions to superior vendors, firms will become more centralised in core components (Wiig 2000).Karl M. Wiig (2007) The Intelligent Enterprise and Knowledge Management1, Texas: Knowledge Research Institute, Inc However, the degree to which the intelligent enterprise can be successful depends on the \\"competencies of the people and its operational capabilities\\" (Yingzhao, Dexiong) Ming Yingzhao, Feng Dexiong (n.d.) Research on the Intelligent Enterprise Based on Intelligent Behaviour , School of Management, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, P.R.China: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Innovation & Management such as, structure, policies and systems. In order to achieve exceptional success, the combination of utilising intelligence and competitive information of the environment is essential. Real Life Examples =Honda= Once Honda began, it competed with companies such as Toyota and other Japanese producers ‚Äì however, outsourcing many of its components to achieve high economies of scale and solely focusing on the development and production of its manufacturing operations made it successful ‚Äì in addition to developing an organised leadership team (Quinn 1999).

Instead, Apple focused on the design, logistics, software and product assembly. Due to the concentration of only a few knowledge adding services, Apple was able to rise to the top of the highly competitive PC market and attain great sales (Gupta, Sharma 2004).Jatinder N. D. Gupta, Sushil Kumar Sharma (2004) Intelligent Enterprises of the 21st Century, London: Idea Group Publishing Advantages of Intelligent Enterprises Gupta states that more available information will lead to better decision-making and thus, would be beneficial in a macro economic sense (Gupta, Sharma 2004). In the 1990s, the implementation of new technologies created this churn of high productivity level ‚Äì thus, helping the macro economy as it enables faster growth and lower inflation. In turn, faster economic growth leads to higher real wages and a decrease in unemployment. As well as benefiting the macro economic goals, it also has a great impact within the industry. Due to easier access to information, it helps industries view their demand and supply between productions. Therefore, a reduction in product volatility and tighter inventory levels are usually expected. Gupta separates the advantages of Intelligent Enterprises into 3 different levels: Operations, Tactical and Strategies (Gupta, Sharma 2004). Operations: In an operative view, intelligent enterprises sets the platform in which automates processes and allows the access to all data information which may have been physically and logically dispersed at one time. Tactical: Tactically, it helps in making better decision-making as information is easily accessed and can also reduce the length in which they are made. Strategies: The reduction of operating times promotes the reduction of operating costs thus leading to better customer services. In addition, advanced business decision-making follows to better tactical strategies. Limitations of Intelligent Enterprises However, as with all business theories, there are limitations. Palmer, a Ph. D student, has found that corporations and businesses are blinded at the fact that in order for intelligent enterprises to work it is both the inner and outer of businesses, which need to work hand in hand. The inner of a business includes the following: strategic planning from the management, resource efficiency, opportunities, processes and interaction with the environment (Palmer 2007) Exploring Intelligent Entreprise System Limitations Kent D. Palmer (2007) Exploring Intelligent Entreprise System Limitations, CA : INCOSE. On the other hand, the latter would include those such as the general economy ‚Äì economic pressures, corporation‚Äôs mergers and takeovers ‚Äì in hand, have an effect internally. It is important to note that humans are the intelligence behind the technological systems and to affirm the validity is still very limited. Human beings have many qualities that are different to that of a technology apparatus (psychological and sociological), which needs to be taken into account. Therefore, limiting this theory to that of a technological approach should not be the sole focus of a corporation (Palmer 2007).

Standardizing the style of marching also serves to add to the visual effect of a marching band. Sometimes special shoes are worn with a curved heel that facilitates rolling the foot. Glide stepping is used by many high school marching bands, college marching bands, and by many Drum Corps. Glide stepping is sometimes also known as \\"roll stepping\\".  Technique  Glide step seeks to restrict all motion above the upper-body to a smooth unchanging motion in the direction of travel and to restrict all motion below the waist to that which is completely necessary. Before the glide step can be learned, the general posture of the body must be normalized. This is called \\"attention\\". The important aspects of attention for marching are having a tall, straight posture with hips shifted slightly back, keeping weight distributed slightly forward and off the heels, and general relaxation of all major muscles. A general guideline for the body's position relative to the rest of the body is the ears should be over the shoulders, the shoulders over the hips, and the hips over the ankles. In the \\"attention\\" position, the feet are either together and parallel to each other, or each foot is approximately 30 degrees off of parallel to each other. This call and response is commonly used by bands that follow George N. Parks' training examples to standardize posture: \\"Feet! (Together!) Stomach! (In!) Chest! (Out!) Shoulders! (Back!) Elbows! (Frozen!) Chin! (Up!) Eyes! (With pride!) Eyes! (With pride!)\\" From attention, the next step is to learn mark time. This involves alternately picking up the left and right legs from their position at attention to the \\"check\\" position. At \\"check\\", the leg is bent slightly, the heel is approximately 1-2 inches off the ground, and the toes are in line with each other. Important aspects of marking time are that the hips should not shift as the legs are lifted and that the weight is kept forward on the balls of the feet. A common command, often called out by a drum major, usually consists of, \\"Mark time, mark!\\", followed by four beats of marking time (left, right, left, right) and then the first step with the left foot. The first step to moving forward is to move the leg from a \\"check\\" position to an \\"extended\\" position. The heel of the extended foot should be placed slightly inside of \\"straight ahead\\" so that about 1/3 of the foot is in front of the stationary foot. In the \\"extended\\" position, the weight has not yet shifted forward, but the leg- in-motion has been straightened forward so that the heel is on the ground and the toes are pointed in the air as high as possible. While the body itself should be moving smoothly along, this motion should be very snappy, emphasizing that the toes are stuck in the air so that the bottom of the extended foot is exposed. A common instruction is to \\"dig in with the heel\\", which emphasizes starting the step as far back on the heel as possible. This, in turn, should lead to higher toe lift. Next, the weight is shifted forward from the ball of the stationary foot to the ball of extended foot. This motion is called \\"rolling through\\". Because this is the primary \\"stepping\\" motion, it is important that it be as fluid as possible. Even after \\"rolling through\\", the stationary leg should still be as straight as possible. Only after the weight has been shifted from one foot to the next should the back leg be bent slightly to allow it to glide forward (while the foot remains as close to the ground as possible) into the next \\"check\\" position. From this check position, the leg smoothly transitions into the next \\"extend\\" position, and so on. At the halfway point of the motion, the moving foot should be passing the ankle of the stationary foot. Generally there are two standard sizes for a roll step. First, the most common is from heel to heel, in the extend position. When executed at this size a marcher that started with the balls of his feet on a yard line will end up with the balls of his feet on the next yard line, five yards away, after taking eight steps; thus, this step is known as the \\"8 to 5 step\\". The second increment is slightly larger at 30 inches, and will move five yards in six steps. In order to correctly march these sizes, a performer generally uses muscle memory to execute these steps. The step sizes called for can sometimes be larger than a 6 to 5 step, but generally a marcher will switch to jazz running if the step needs to be larger than a 5 to 5 step. One incorrect tendency of glide-step marching is bicycling, or the tendency to lift one's foot too high off the ground when taking a step. This leads to extra bending in the knees, which gives the impression of riding a bicycle. Other skills utilized in glide-step marching are facings, sliding (keeping the upper body facing a different direction than the lower body), adjusting stride length, back-marching, and matching all of these motions to a specific tempo.

According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 590. Names The Yiddish name for the city was ◊°◊®◊¢◊ì◊†◊ô◊ß (Srednik), corresponding to the Polish ≈öredniki and Russian –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∏ (Sredniki). In local Samogitian dialect the town is known as Seredius, in Lithuanian - Sered≈æius. Other recorded forms of the town's name include Srednike, Seredzhyus, Seredzhus and Seredius. The name Sered≈æius is believed to be derived from —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞ (sereda), a word meaning \\"Wednesday\\" in many Slavic languages. This is probably because of the markets held there on Wednesday. History View of Sered≈æius with Palemon Hill (hillfort) in the background Southeast of the town, archaeologists discovered graves from the 3rd‚Äì4th centuries. According to the Palemonids legend, noble refugees from the Roman Empire settled on the hill, now named after Palemon, and established the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The town has a large hillfort where Lithuanian Pie≈°tvƒó fortress stood during the Lithuanian Crusade. It was attacked by the Teutonic Knights numerous times in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. After the Battle of Grunwald, the location lost its military purpose and became private property of the Sapieha family. The Sapiehas built a residential palace, which did not survive. The town's first Catholic church was built around 1608‚Äì12. The church was destroyed in 1829 after a landslide caused by extensive flooding. The residents built a wooden church, which was replaced by a Neo- Renaissance church dedicated to John the Baptist in 1913. The town had a large Jewish population prior to World War II. In 1900 (when part of the Russian Empire) the town's Jewish population numbered 1,174. The town's Jews were killed on September 4, 1941. On that day, 193 people were shot near the village of Skrebƒónai: 6 men, 61 women and 126 children.

He translated several Arabic works into Latin, the most important of which was the Chronicon orientale attributed to Ibn al-Rahib. Born in Haqil, Lebanon, his last name derived from his place of birth. Ibrahim was educated at the Maronite College in Rome. After taking his doctorate in theology and philosophy, he returned for a time to his native land. Ibrahim was ordained as a deacon and later taught Arabic and Syriac, first in Pisa and then in Rome in the College of the Propaganda. In 1628, he published a Syriac grammar. Called to Paris in 1640 to assist Gay-Michel Le Jay in the preparation of his polyglot Bible, Ibrahim contributed to that work the Arabic and Latin versions of the Book of Ruth and the Arabic version of 3 Maccabees. In 1646, Ibrahim was appointed professor of Syriac and Arabic at the Coll√®ge de France. Being invited by the Congregation of the Propaganda to take part in the preparation of an Arabic version of the Bible, Ibrahim went again in 1652 or 1653 to Rome. He published several Latin translations of Arabic works, of which the most important was the Chronicon Orientale of Ibnar-Rahib (1653), a history of the patriarchs of Alexandria. Ibrahim engaged in an interesting controversy with John Selden about the historical grounds of episcopal polity, spurring him to publish his Eutychius vindicatus, sive Responsio ad Seldeni Origines (1661). With Giovanni Alfonso Borelli he wrote a Latin translation of the 5th, 6th and 7th books of the Conics by the geometrician Apollonius of Perga (1661). Ibrahim was also the first person to identify the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran as descended from the Gnostic movements going back to the 1st century.

In contrast with pre-planned conferences where who will speak at which time is scheduled often months in advance, and therefore subject to many changes, OST sources participants once they are physically present at the live event venue. In this sense OST is participant-driven and less organizer-convener-driven. Pre-planning remains essential; you simply need much less pre-planning. The actual agenda-schedule of presentations is partly or mostly unknown until people begin arriving. The scheduling of which talk, on which topic in which room is created by people attending, once they arrive. At the end of each OST meeting, a debriefing doc is created summarizing what worked and what did not work so the process can go more smoothly next year. OST began with efforts in the 1980s, by Harrison Owen. It was one of the top ten organization development tools cited between 2004 and 2013. History The approach was originated by Harrison Owen, an Episcopal priest whose academic background and training centered on the nature and function of myth, ritual and culture. In the middle ‚Äô60s, he left academe to work with a variety of organizations including small West African villages, large corporations and NGOs, urban (American and African) community organizations, Peace Corps, Regional Medical Programs, National Institutes of Health, and Veterans Administration. Along the way he discovered that his study of myth, ritual and culture had direct application to these social systems. In 1977, he started a consulting company in order to explore the culture of organizations in transformation as a theorist and practicing consultant. Harrison convened the First International Symposium on Organization Transformation as a traditional conference. Afterward, participants told him the best parts were the coffee breaks. So when he did it again, Open Space was his way of making the whole of the conference one big coffee break, albeit with a central theme (purpose, story, question, or \\"myth\\") that would guide the self-organization of the group. Owen's experiment was successful enough that the Organization Transformation symposium continued in Open Space format for more than twenty years. But soon after the first Open Space, participants began using Open Space in their own work and reporting back on their learning. One event, convened in India, around a theme of \\"The Business of Business is Learning,\\" attracted local media attention that was noticed by the New York Times, who later published their own stories on Open Space, in 1988 and 1994. Owen wrote a Brief User's Guide to support further experimentation and practice. Eventually, an expanded guide was published by Berrett-Koehler. In the 1980s, Owen was considered by many large corporations to be one of several New Age consultants whose methods might encourage employee participation and interest in company problems. Central elements = Self-organization = Open Space meeting at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center \\"Open space\\" meetings are to a lesser or greater degree \\"self- organizing.\\" Participants and speakers have all been invited or paid to attend. However after confirming the overall theme and focus, the meeting organizer-sponsor is much less active. The details of the daily speaking schedule are to a lesser or greater degree created and organized by attending participants and speakers \\"on the day of.\\" Given the potential chaotic nature of \\"open space\\" meetings, when the event begins, the organizer-sponsor gives their best shot at focussing the theme, groundrules, values and energies of the conference. This often includes short introductions of each speaker present. The organizer-sponsor explains the \\"self-organizing\\" process along with any rules for changing times, talks and schedules once they are made public. The ideal event facilitator is \\"fully present and totally invisible\\", \\"holding a space\\" for participants to self-organize, rather than micro- managing activity and conversations (paraphrase). = Outcomes = Because the agenda of an Open Space meeting emerges, more like a living thing, what exactly is going to happen or be addressed is unknown to a lesser or greater degree. Still, several meaningful outcomes can and should be specifically built into the process (safety, trust, courtesy) (paraphrase). Open Space meetings are usually convened for a hours to a few days. At the end of some (especially longer) open space meetings, a proceedings document is compiled from the notes taken in all of the breakout sessions. This is distributed, on paper or electronically, to all participants and used as the basis for prioritizing issues, identifying next steps, and continuing the work beyond the meeting itself. Where OST Has Been Used Several other approaches share one or more features with OST: \\"unconferences\\", e.g. FooCamp and BarCamp. Both FooCamp and BarCamp are participant-driven, like OST, but neither is organized around a pre-set theme or aimed at solving a problem. The first Foo Camp was organized by Tim O'Reilly and Sara Winge; because Sara had been a student of Harrison Owen, many elements similar to OST are used in Foo Camp. The Open Space approach was first used in the Agile software development community at the Agile/XP Universe conference in 2002. That group eventually developed into the Agile Alliance, which has supported the use of Open Space in the Agile community. Since then, Open Space has been used for leading Agile transformation and for requirements gathering in Agile projects. A design sprint (a meeting technique related to design thinking and pioneered by Google Ventures) is similar to OST in that participants are invited by an organizer to work collaboratively on solving a problem, with the help of a facilitator who is trained in running such meetings. (Google also sometimes uses OST methods.) In a design sprint, all participants are asked to contribute ideas toward what the problem is and how to solve it, but in a design sprint the facilitator is not invisible but in charge, guiding participants through a (typically) five-day process whose output includes a prototype part-solution and a user-test by some typical \\"customers.\\" Some meeting organizers use Open Space techniques in combination with other methods, to avoid what they see as \\"shortcomings\\" of OST, for example an atmosphere that is potentially unfriendly for introverts.

The Pleasant Grove area is bounded by Bruton Road to the North, Elam Road, towards Seagoville, Texas on the South, Hickory Creek on the East towards Balch Springs, Texas and Jim Miller Road on the West.  History  The first settlers in the Pleasant Grove area in the 1840s included W. B. Elam, who held one of the original land grant, Richard Bruton, and Cornelius Cox. By 1875 a wooden building was used as a union church and school. An early teacher at one of the schools built in the 1880s was Don Lebow, who named the school Pleasant Grove after its location in a grove of cottonwood trees. The name was then applied to both the school and the community. In 1900 Sam Street's map of Dallas County showed Pleasant Grove as a small community with a store. In 1916 the first brick schoolhouse was built. In 1937 Pleasant Grove formed its own school district, which by the late 1940s had fourteen buildings. Due to a post-World War II housing boom the population grew from 120 to 3,500 between 1943 and 1952. By the late 1940s Pleasant Grove had seven businesses, including a new bank. Businesses remained less important than the residential areas, but in 1952 Pleasant Grove Shopping Center, a major retail center, was built. Pleasant Grove twice fought incorporation movements and remained unincorporated till June 1954 when Pleasant Grove was annexed by Dallas and the Pleasant Grove school district merged with the Dallas Independent School District. In 1962 the Greater Pleasant Grove Chamber of Commerce was formed to promote business in the area.

Essentially, the plan provides a link between a municipality, school district, parks and recreation department and/or other local government entity and a comprehensive and strategic plan and the entity's annual budget. Benefits A CIP provides many benefits including: * Allows for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time. * The ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing costs. * Serve as a public relations and economic development tool. * A focus on preserving a governmental entity's infrastructure while ensuring the efficient use of public funds. * An opportunity to foster cooperation among departments and an ability to inform other units of government of the entity's priorities. For example, it is not uncommon for a large city or county to incorporate into its CIP the capital needs of a school district, parks and recreation department and/or some other public service structure. Features The CIP typically includes the following information: * A listing of the capital projects or equipment to be purchased * The projects ranked in order of preference * The plan for financing the projects * A timetable for the construction or completion of the project * Justification for the project * Explanation of expenses for the project Overall process Prior to undertaking the development of the CIP, the government entity will want to define the criteria for what kind of projects or equipment are to be included and organize a process for developing the plan. What is defined as a capital project or capital purchase may vary from city to county to district to state depending on the size of the local government provisioning the plan. Generally, they will be tangible items that have a life expectancy greater than one year. A local government will also need to forecast where it believes it will face future demands and growth, which will involve an inventory of existing facilities, infrastructure and equipment. In addition, a local government will want to develop basic policies for implementing the plan. Because the CIP includes financing issues, the municipality may want to seek advice from their financial advisor and/or bond counsel. A review of the municipality's current finances is also vital. Once the CIP is finalized, the local government may be required to hold a public hearing before the plan is adopted by a city council, a board of regents and/or a bond review commission. Specific steps # Establish a capital planning committee with bylaws # Take inventory of existing capital assets # Evaluate previously approved, unimplemented or incomplete projects # Assess financial capacity # Solicit, compile and evaluate new project requests # Prioritize projects # Develop a financing plan # Adopt a capital improvement program # Monitor and manage approved projects within the CIP # Update existing/ongoing capital programs Developing a Capital Improvements Plan - Massachusetts 1997.pdf References External links * Capital Project Management, British Columbia Ministry of Education * City and County of San Francisco Ten Year Capital Plan * City of Vancouver Capital Plan * Government Finance Officers Association Committee on Economic Development and Capital Planning Category:Urban planning ","title":"Capital improvement plan"},{"id":"2988405","text":"Ivan Nikolayevich Smirnov (; 9 September 1955 in Moscow, USSR ‚Äì 15 November 2018) was regarded as one of the greatest guitar players in Russia.

All three plays depict the shocking and murderous goings-on in the Western Ireland town of Leenane. Synopsis The Lonesome West features the persistently arguing brothers Coleman and Valene, whose father has just died in a shotgun 'accident.' Valene is only interested in his religious ornaments and drinking poteen. Coleman is only interested in eating, and attends funerals to collect free sausage rolls and vol au vents. Valene goes out to help drag the body of Garda Thomas Hanlon (character in \\"A Skull in Connemara\\") out of the lake with Father Welsh. Hanlon had just killed himself. Coleman pretends to follow, delaying to tie his shoelace, despite the fact that he was wearing loafers. While alone in the house, he destroys all of Valene's plastic figurines, by placing them in Valene's new stove. Only Father Welsh, the alcoholic parish priest, attempts to fix their relationship, but his advice mostly goes unheard. It is revealed later in the play that Coleman had shot his father because he insulted his (Coleman's) new haircut. Valene agreed to provide a false alibi for Coleman, stating that their father's death was accidental. In exchange, he demanded Coleman's share of the inheritance money. Neither of the brothers show any grief or remorse at their father's death. The two brothers fight over everything and anything. Valene attacks Coleman over eating his crisps, and they fight over whose turn it is to read the magazine, and who left the top off Valene's pen. Father Welsh, depressed because of the hatred between the brothers, and with a low self-esteem, writes a letter begging the brothers to get along, asserting that he will stake his soul on it. Father Welsh then proceeds to drown himself in the lake. This act is significant, as there has already been a lengthy discussion about suicide in the play. The characters believe that damnation follows suicide for the victims. When Coleman and Valene read his letter, they attempt to reconcile themselves, and a \\"confessions\\" scene ensues, in which the brothers take turns to admit the wrongs that they had secretly done to each other in the past, and to forgive each other's \\"sins.\\" Coleman loses his temper when Valene admits to shoving a pencil down the throat of a Coleman's old girlfriend, causing her to then fall in love with the doctor that removed it. In a fit of rage, Coleman proceeds to smash Valene's new collection of ceramic religious figurines, and destroy his stove with multiple shot gun blasts. After Coleman calms down, Valene says \\"Try and top that one for yourself\\". Coleman does, however, deliver an even more terrible confession. He reveals that he cut the ears of Valene's dog two years previously, presenting the evidence of severed dog's ears in a brown paper bag. With this, Valene flies into a rage, and a major fight scene ensues. It becomes clear that the two brothers can never have a good relationship. They agree that fighting is actually good for them, and that Father Welsh's soul can rot in hell, for all they care. Who even asked him to bet it on them in the first place?

Sharpe repeatedly fired a spear gun into the heads of his victims, later exhumed the body of his wife from a shallow grave, dismembered her, then disposed of her body in a landfill. Claiming his innocence, he later appeared in emotional interviews on television seeking information on his family's whereabouts. Sharpe eventually confessed to the murders and was sentenced in 2005 to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 33 years. He will be eligible for parole in 2037. For his part in the crime, Sharpe became generally known as the \\"Speargun killer\\" or the \\"Mornington Monster\\". Background John Sharpe was born 28 February 1967 in Mornington, where he also grew up. Sharpe met his New Zealand-born wife, Anna Kemp, when they worked together at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. They married in October 1994 and lived together in various locations around the Mornington Peninsula area south of Melbourne. Their daughter, Gracie, was born in August 2002. She was born with a condition called hip dysplasia, a congenital abnormality in her hips which required orthopaedic treatment by a corrective harness for the first three months of her life. She cried often and had difficulty sleeping, a situation which appeared to place some strain on the marriage. Even after the harness was no longer required, Gracie still had difficulties with feeding and sleeping, for which Kemp sought professional assistance. In 2003, Sharpe purchased a high-powered speargun and an additional spear at Sport Philip Marine, a local shop in Mornington. He had not previously shown an interest in spearfishing. He practised firing the speargun in the backyard of the couple's residence, in order to become familiar with its operation. Later that year, the Sharpes purchased a house at 116 Prince Street, Mornington. In November 2003, when Gracie was about 15 months old, Kemp became pregnant again. Sharpe later told police investigators that this pregnancy came as a surprise to him. Sharpe apparently decided that he did not want another child‚Äîin his mind, one was enough of a burden‚Äîand he began to resent Kemp and the unborn child. Murders On 21 March 2004, Sharpe and his family attended a nephew's birthday party. Others present at the party noticed no tension or arguments between the couple. On 23 March, Sharpe and his wife argued before retiring to bed. He later left the bed and retrieved the speargun from the backyard garage. Returning to the bedroom, Sharpe fired the spear from a distance of a few centimetres into his wife's left temple. Noticing his wife was still breathing, Sharpe fired a second spear into her head, killing her. He then covered the body in towels and went downstairs to sleep on a sofa bed. The next day, Sharpe attempted to remove the spears but failed, removing only the shafts by unscrewing them from the heads. That same day, Sharpe took Gracie to, and then collected her from, her childcare centre. He also lied to a TV serviceman who came to the house. He later buried his wife in a shallow grave in their backyard. Some time after his wife's death, Sharpe returned to Sport Phillip Marine (accompanied by his daughter) and purchased another spear for the speargun. On 27 March 2004, Sharpe put his daughter Gracie to bed in her cot and then drank several glasses of whiskey and Coke in order to \\"numb his senses.\\" He retrieved the speargun from the garage, loaded it with the newly acquired spear, and fired at his daughter's head, penetrating her skull. With his child wounded and screaming loudly, Sharpe retrieved the two spear shafts which he had earlier removed from his wife's head and returned to the bedroom. He fired both into Gracie's head, but she was still alive, so he withdrew one spear and fired it again, finally killing her. He returned to her bedroom the next morning and pulled the spears from her head. Sharpe then wrapped her body in garbage bags and a tarpaulin and disposed of her body at the Mornington refuse transfer station. At the same time he discarded the speargun, the spears and some of Gracie's clothes and toys. =Aftermath= On 29 March 2004, Sharpe visited a local Bunnings Warehouse hardware store in Frankston, where he purchased a roll of duct tape, two tarpaulins, and an electric chainsaw. The following day, he exhumed Kemp and cut her into three pieces. He then wrapped the remains in a tarpaulin and disposed of them, along with the chainsaw, in waste collection bins at the Mornington Transfer Station. On the same day he sent a forged e-mail to Kemp's family in New Zealand to create the impression she was alive and well. Rather than comfort the family, his e-mail raised further concerns, and Kemp's mother reported her disappearance to police in Dunedin, New Zealand. Sharpe later told police that Kemp had moved to the nearby Melbourne suburb of Chelsea with their daughter, and denied any knowledge of or involvement in her disappearance. He also arranged for flowers in Kemp's name to be delivered to his mother-in-law on her birthday. During May 2004, Sharpe gave several media interviews, and appeared on national television speaking of his wife and child's disappearance. In part of his appeal he said: \\"Anna, our marriage may be over but I still love you and you are the mother of our beautiful daughter Gracie, whom we both adore more than anyone else\\". Sharpe then said he had spoken to his wife a week earlier and he asked for anyone with information to come forward. He however also maintained that she had run off with another man. Arrest and conviction On 20 May 2004, New Zealand Police requested Victoria Police to conduct enquiries into the apparent disappearance of Kemp and Gracie. The same day, police from Mornington attended the Sharpe home and spoke with him. On 10 June, he was again interviewed by police in Mornington but he maintained the story that Kemp had left voluntarily on 23 March. On 22 June 2004, police arrested Sharpe and interviewed him twice: during his first interview, he continued to deny any knowledge of their whereabouts, but during the second, having spoken to his family, he admitted to both murders. He told police he killed his wife because she was \\"controlling and moody\\" and their marriage was unhappy. He also told police he \\"was thinking of taking care of Gracie by myself and just amongst all this madness ... that's when I lost the plot\\". According to some family members, Sharpe may have also killed his wife because she discovered his abuse of Gracie. The claim comes as family letters reveal Sharpe had a history of sexually abusing children. Police undertook a massive search lasting three weeks of the Mornington landfill site, and eventually recovered both bodies. Both were buried in Green Park Cemetery, Dunedin, under Kemp's birth name. Gracie's birth and death certificates were posthumously edited to read \\"father unknown\\". Sharpe appeared in the Supreme Court of Victoria where he was arraigned and pleaded guilty to the murders. On 5 August 2005, the Court sentenced Sharpe to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 33 years. Sharpe resides in protective custody while incarcerated, due to threats on his life from fellow prisoners. Media coverage The stages of the Sharpe case were all major news items in the Australian print and television media of the time. The murder also received general media attention in New Zealand, and sparked the interest of the New Zealand Police.

Roosevelt on August 2, 1939. Written by Szil√°rd in consultation with fellow Hungarian physicists Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, the letter warned that Germany might develop atomic bombs and suggested that the United States should start its own nuclear program. It prompted action by Roosevelt, which eventually resulted in the Manhattan Project developing the first atomic bombs. Origin Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann reported the discovery of uranium fission in the January 6, 1939 issue of Die Naturwissenschaften, and Lise Meitner identified it as nuclear fission in the February 11, 1939 issue of Nature. This generated intense interest among physicists. Danish physicist Niels Bohr brought the news to the United States, and the U.S. opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Enrico Fermi on January 26, 1939. The results were quickly corroborated by experimental physicists, most notably Fermi and John R. Dunning at Columbia University. Hungarian physicist Le√≥ Szil√°rd was living in the United States at the time and realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction which could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. He had first formulated such an idea in 1933 upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szil√°rd had not been able to achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if the number of secondary neutrons produced in a neutron-driven chain reaction was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions. Szil√°rd teamed up with Fermi to build a nuclear reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where George B. Pegram headed the physics department. There was disagreement about whether fission was produced by uranium-235, which made up less than one percent of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained. Fermi and Szil√°rd conducted a series of experiments and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons but tended to capture them. Szil√°rd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They then needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szil√°rd was convinced that they would succeed if they could get the materials. Szil√°rd was concerned that German scientists might also attempt this experiment. German nuclear physicist Siegfried Fl√ºgge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the Belgian Congo was the best source of uranium ore. Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein might be a suitable person to do this, as he knew the Belgian Royal Family.  The letter  On July 12, 1939, Szil√°rd and Wigner drove in Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they explained about the possibility of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szil√°rd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections. This still left the problem of getting government support for uranium research. Another friend of Szil√°rd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szil√°rd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szil√°rd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szil√°rd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szil√°rd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein. Szil√°rd also set out himself for Long Island again on August 2. Wigner was unavailable, so this time Szil√°rd co-opted another Hungarian physicist, Edward Teller, to do the driving. After receiving the draft, Einstein dictated the letter first in German. On returning to Columbia University, Szil√°rd dictated the letter in English to a young departmental stenographer, Janet Coatesworth. She later recalled that when Szil√°rd mentioned extremely powerful bombs, she \\"was sure she was working for a nut\\". Ending the letter with \\"Yours truly, Albert Einstein\\" did nothing to alter this impression. Both the English letter and a longer explanatory letter were then posted to Einstein for him to sign. The letter dated 2 August and addressed to President Roosevelt warned that: It also specifically warned about Germany: At the time of the letter, the estimated material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons. Seven months later a breakthrough in Britain would estimate the necessary critical mass to be less than 10 kilograms, making delivery of a bomb by air a possibility.  Delivery  Roosevelt's reply The Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter was signed by Einstein and posted back to Szil√°rd, who received it on August 9. Szil√°rd gave both the short and long letters, along with a letter of his own, to Sachs on August 15. Sachs asked the White House staff for an appointment to see President Roosevelt, but before one could be set up, the administration became embroiled in a crisis due to Germany's invasion of Poland, which started World War II. Sachs delayed his appointment until October so that the President would give the letter due attention, securing an appointment on October 11. On that date he met with the President, the President's secretary, Brigadier General Edwin \\"Pa\\" Watson, and two ordnance experts, Army Lieutenant Colonel Keith F. Adamson and Navy Commander Gilbert C. Hoover. Roosevelt summed up the conversation as: \\"Alex, what you are after is to see that the Nazis don't blow us up.\\" Roosevelt sent a reply thanking Einstein, and informing him that: Einstein sent two more letters to Roosevelt, on March 7, 1940, and April 25, 1940, calling for action on nuclear research. Szil√°rd drafted a fourth letter for Einstein's signature that urged the President to meet with Szil√°rd to discuss policy on nuclear energy. Dated March 25, 1945, it did not reach Roosevelt before his death on April 12, 1945. Results Roosevelt decided that the letter required action, and authorized the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened for the first time on October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau of Standards, Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szil√°rd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szil√°rd and Fermi's experiment. The Advisory Committee on Uranium was the beginning of the US government's effort to develop an atomic bomb, but it did not vigorously pursue the development of a weapon. It was superseded by the National Defense Research Committee in 1940, and then the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941. The Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum and the British Maud Reports eventually prompted Roosevelt to authorize a full- scale development effort in January 1942. The work of fission research was taken over by the United States Army Corps of Engineers's Manhattan District in June 1942, which directed an all-out bomb development program known as the Manhattan Project. Einstein did not work on the Manhattan Project. The Army and Vannevar Bush denied him the work clearance needed in July 1940, saying his pacifist leanings and celebrity made him a security risk. At least one source states that Einstein did clandestinely contribute some equations to the Manhattan Project.Genius, Albert Einstein, National Geographic 2017 Einstein was allowed to work as a consultant to the United States Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. He had no knowledge of the atomic bomb's development, and no influence on the decision for the bomb to be dropped. According to Linus Pauling, Einstein later regretted signing the letter because it led to the development and use of the atomic bomb in combat, adding that Einstein had justified his decision because of the greater danger that Nazi Germany would develop the bomb first. In 1947 Einstein told Newsweek magazine that \\"had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.\\" See also * Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum * Nuclear weapons and the United States * Szil√°rd petition * List of most expensive books and manuscripts Notes  References   * External links * Reproduction of 1939 Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter * Roosevelt correspondence with Einstein and Szil√°rd, FDR library, Marist University * Einstein and Szilard re-enact their meeting for the film Atomic Power (1946) Category:Albert Einstein Category:History of the Manhattan Project Category:1939 documents Category:World War II documents Category:Letters (message) ","title":"Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter"},{"id":"2988454","text":"Daisy Voisin (23 September 1924 ‚Äì 7 August 1991) was a Parang singer and composer. Life and career Voisin was born in Erin, Trinidad and Tobago. She began her singing career in the Village Council and other local groups. A deeply religious person, she received the message to spread the gospel of Parang in a church in Siparia in 1973. Not long after she was launched into the spotlight at a \\"Best Village\\" competition in 1971. She did her best to live up to that calling. Hailed as the undisputed \\"Queen of Parang\\" for her vocal prowess and the many triumphs and popularity of the band she led, the La Divina Pastora Serenaders, Daisy Voisin left an indelible mark on the local Parang scene in Trinidad and Tobago. Armed with her sweet, powerful voice and a bouquet of flowers in hand, she ruled Parang music in for countless years. Her signature songs \\"Hurray Hurrah\\" and \\"Alegr√≠a, Alegr√≠a\\" becoming Christmas classics, sung with her characteristic musical trill \\"aiyee, aiyee\\". Her live performances were described as \\"explosive, vivacious and tempestuous\\". Voisin and her group became cultural ambassadors for Trinidad and Tobago taking the music to places in the Caribbean, Isla de Margarita, Venezuela and North America. In the later days of her life, Voisin's performances were few, hampered by ill-health, but the quality of her voice was still evident.

It is the triester of glycerol and acetylating agents, such as acetic acid and acetic anhydride. It is a colorless, viscous and odorless liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP) with a high boiling point and a low melting point. It has a mild, sweet taste in concentrations lower than 500 ppm, but may appear bitter at higher concentrations. It is one of the glycerine acetate compounds. Triacetin was first prepared in 1854 by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. ; see \\"Triac√©tine\\", pp. 282‚Äì283. Uses It is an artificial chemical compound, commonly used as a food additive, for instance as a solvent in flavourings, and for its humectant function, with E number E1518 and Australian approval code A1518. It is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical products, where it is used as a humectant, a plasticizer, and as a solvent. The plasticizing capabilities of triacetin have been utilized in the synthesis of a biodegradable phospholipid gel system for the dissemination of the cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX). In the study, triacetin was combined with PTX, ethanol, a phospholipid and a medium chain triglyceride to form a gel-drug complex. This complex was then injected directly into the cancer cells of glioma-bearing mice. The gel slowly degraded and facilitated sustained release of PTX into the targeted glioma cells. Additionally, preliminary research also suggests that triacetin can be used to directly treat glioblastoma. The study found that triacetin is a viable mediator for acetate supplementation, a therapy that inhibits glioblastoma cell growth. Triacetin can also be used as a fuel additive as an antiknock agent which can reduce engine knocking in gasoline, and to improve cold and viscosity properties of biodiesel. It has been considered as a possible source of food energy in artificial food regeneration systems on long space missions. It is believed to be safe to get over half of one's dietary energy from triacetin.  Synthesis  The synthesis of triacetin from acetic anhydride and glycerol is simple and inexpensive. : 3 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí 2 \\\\+ 3 This synthesis has been conducted with catalytic sodium hydroxide and microwave irradiation to give a 99% yield of triacetin. It has also been conducted with a cobalt(II) Salen complex catalyst supported by silicon dioxide and heated to 50 ¬∞C for 55 minutes to give a 99% yield of triacetin. Safety The US Food and Drug Administration has approved it as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) food additive and included it in the database according to the opinion from the Select Committee On GRAS Substances (SCOGS). :\\"Triacetin and two types of acetooleins have been found to be without toxic effects in long-term feeding tests in rats at levels that were several orders of magnitude greater than those to which consumers are exposed. Three types of acetostearins have been found to be without toxic effects in long-term feeding tests in rats at levels up to 5 g per kg per day. This contrasts with an estimated human consumption of a fraction of a milligram per kg per day. It is recognized that at an even higher feeding level (10 g per kg per day) male rats developed testicular atrophy and female rats, uterine discoloration. However, such a level which would amount to 50 g or more for an infant and 600 g for an adult per day, is vastly higher than would be possible in the consumption of foods to which acetostearins are added for functional purposes.\\" Triacetin is included in the SCOGS database since 1975. Triacetin was not toxic to animals in studies of exposure through repeated inhalation over a relatively short period.

Embark has 20 interconnecting bus routes covering the city of Oklahoma City and parts of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area, including weekday Express service from Norman to Downtown Oklahoma City and the \\"Oklahoma Spirit Trolleys\\", a trolley-replica bus network. In 2018 the Oklahoma City Streetcar began service throughout downtown Oklahoma City, signaling the beginning of EMBARK becoming a diversified transit agency. History The Central Oklahoma Transportation and Parking Authority was established on February 1, 1966 by the Oklahoma City Council to continue transit service as private operator Oklahoma Transportation Company, which provided bus service to the community, as City Bus Company, had announced it would discontinue transit service due to low ridership. There were initially only 18 buses, all leased from OTC. The system was rebranded as MassTrans in 1975 and used that name until 1992, when it was rebranded as Metro Transit, though the official name remains in use as well. COTPA was reorganized in 1989, when the city established a Transit Services division to provide senior management through an inter-local operating agreement. COTPA also bought Union Station which serves as headquarters to this day. In September 2013, it was announced Metro Transit will change its name to Embark which will take effect on April 28, 2014, which will include a new bus route system. On 15 October 2015, Embark announced that they will be offering free Wi-Fi on all buses, on all routes. In August 2016, Embark has received the award for \\"North America's Outstanding Public Transportation System\\" by the American Public Transportation Association for systems providing less than 4 million annual passenger trips. Since 27 January 2019, for the first time in Oklahoma City public transportation history, Sunday bus service was implemented and the routes and schedules will be the same as it on Saturdays. Effective Monday, 2 September 2019, Labor Day, EMBARK buses will operate on all major holidays, which means public transportation in Oklahoma City will operate 365 days a year for the first time in its history. The holiday schedule will be the same as it is on Saturdays and Sundays. Link An unusual aspect of Embark was the Link program, which is a combination of owl service and paratransit service. Since regularly scheduled routes operate only until about 8pm local time, and not at all Sundays, Link provides nominally fixed route service from 7 pm until 12 midnight Monday through Saturday, and Sunday from 7 am until 7 pm. The four routes may however, deviate by as much as three-quarters of a mile from the fixed route if the customer notifies Embark by 4 pm the day before (or by 12 noon Saturday for Monday service). An additional fee will be charged in that instance, but customers using the fixed stops will be charged the normal fare. The Link was discontinued in April 2014 as Embark began extending hours on 4 routes (see below). Fares No fare to kids below 7 with fare-paying rider; limit 3.

He was a leading exponent of the neoclassical style of Parisian Atticism. Life Job Restored to Prosperity La Hyre was greatly influenced by the work of Italian artists who came to Paris. He became a pupil of Georges Lallemand and studied the works of Primaticcio at Fontainebleau, but never visited Italy. La Hyre's captivating use of color and delicately posed figures are a trademark of his early, painteresque style. He was an innovative artist who used his superior skills as a storyteller to portray rarely depicted subjects. La Hyre is associated with the transitional period before the introduction of the French Baroque by Simon Vouet.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911 His picture of Pope Nicholas V opening the crypt in which he discovers the corpse of St. Francis of Assisi standing (located at the Louvre) was executed in 1630 for the Capuchin friars of the Marais; its gravity and sobriety seems to have been influential for the next generation of French painters, particularly Eustache Le Sueur. The Louvre contains eight other works, and paintings by La Hyre are in the museums of Strasburg, Rouen and Le Mans. Saint Paul Shipwrecked on Malta His drawings, of which the British Museum possesses a fine example, Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, are treated as seriously as his paintings, and sometimes show simplicity and dignity of effect. The example of the Capuchins, for whom he executed several other works in Paris, Rouen and F√©camp, was followed by the goldsmith's company, for whom he produced in 1635 St. Peter healing the Sick (Louvre) and the Conversion of St Paul in 1637. In 1648, La Hyre was one of the founders of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its running.M√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire de l'Acad√©mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture depuis 1648 jusqu'en 1664, Ed. Anatole de Montaiglon, Paris 1853, vol. I, p. 36. Richelieu called La Hyre to the Palais Royal; Pierre S√©guier, G√©d√©on Tallemant des R√©aux and many others entrusted him with important works of decoration; for the Gobelins he designed a series of large compositions. La Hyre painted also a great number of portraits, and in 1654 united in one work for the town-hall of Paris those of the principal dignitaries of the municipality. His students included Fran√ßois Chauveau.

An example of a composite measure is an IQ test, which gives a single score based on a series of responses to various questions. Three common composite measures include: * indexes - measures that summarize and rank specific observations, usually on the ordinal scale; * scales - advanced indexes whose observations are further transformed (scaled) due to their logical or empirical relationships; * typologies - measures that classify observations in terms of their attributes on multiple variables, usually on a nominal scale. Indexes versus scales Indexes are often referred to as scales, but in fact not all indexes are scales. Whereas indexes are usually created by aggregating scores assigned to individual attributes of various variables, scales are more nuanced and take into account differences in intensity among the attribute of the same variable in question. Indexes and scales should provide an ordinal ranking of cases on a given variable, through scales are usually more efficient at this. While indexes are based on a simple aggregation of indicators of a variable, scales are more advanced, and their calculations may be more complex, using for example scaling procedures such as semantic differential. Composite measure validation A good composite measure will ensure that the indicators are independent of one another. It should also successfully predict other indicators of the variable.

A bus analyzer is a type of a protocol analysis tool, used for capturing and analyzing communication data across a specific interface bus, usually embedded in a hardware system. The bus analyzer functionality helps design, test and validation engineers to check, test, debug and validate their designs throughout the design cycles of a hardware- based product. It also helps in later phases of a product life cycle, in examining communication interoperability between systems and between components, and clarifying hardware support concerns.The basics of bus analyzers A bus analyzer is designed for use with specific parallel or serial bus architectures. Though the term bus analyzer implies a physical communication and interface that is being analyzed, it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term protocol analyzer or Packet Analyzer, and may be used also for analysis tools for Wireless interfaces like wireless LAN (like Wi-Fi), PAN (like Bluetooth, Wireless USB), and other, though these technologies do not have a ‚ÄúWired‚Äù Bus. The bus analyzer monitors and captures the bus communication data, decodes and analyses it and displays the data and analysis reports to the user. It is essentially a logic analyzer with some additional knowledge of the underlying bus traffic characteristics. One of the key differences between a bus analyzer and a logic analyzer is notably its ability to filter and extract only relevant traffic that occurs on the analyzed bus. Some advanced logic analyzers present data storage qualification options that also allow to filter bus traffic, enabling bus analyzer-like features.In such a case, it is also sometimes referred to as 'digital bus logger'. This is a kind if data logger that implements a sampling mechanism and a filtering mechanism to extract the traffic that relates to a specific or user-defined protocol. See for example this digital data logger Some key differentiators between bus and logic analyzers are: :1. Cost: Logic analyzers usually carry higher prices than bus analyzers. The converse of this fact is that a logic analyzer can be used with a variety of bus architectures, whereas a bus analyzer is only good with one architecture. :2. Targeted Capabilities and Preformatting of data: A bus analyzer can be designed to provide very specific context for data coming in from the bus. Analyzers for serial buses like USB for example take serial data that arrives as a serial stream of binary 1s and 0s and displays it as logical packets differentiated by chirp, headers, payload etc... :3. Ease of use: While a general purpose logic analyzer, may support multiple busses and interfaces, a bus analyzer is designed for a specific physical interface and usually allows the user to quickly connect the probing hardware to the bus that is tested, saving time and effort. From a user's perspective, a (greatly) simplified viewpoint may be that developers who want the most complete and most targeted capabilities for a single bus architecture may be best served with a bus analyzer, while users who work with several protocols in parallel may be better served with a Logic Analyzer that is less costly than several different bus analyzers and enables them to learn a single user interface vs several. Analyzers are now available for virtually all existing computer and embedded bus standards and form factors such as PCI Express, DDR, USB, PCI, CompactPCI, PMC, VMEbus, CANbus and LINbus, etc. Bus analyzers are used in the Avionics industry to analyze MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, AFDX, and other avionics databus protocols. Other bus analyzers are also used in the mass storage industry to analyze popular data transfer protocols between computers and drives. These cover popular data buses like NVMe, SATA, SAS, ATA/PI, SCSI, etc. These devices are typically connected in series between the host computer and the target drive, where they 'snoop' traffic on the bus, capture it and present it in human-readable format.  Bus and Protocol Exerciser  For many bus architectures like PCI Express, PCI, SAS, SATA, and USB, engineers also use a \\"Bus Exerciser\\" or ‚ÄúProtocol Exerciser‚Äù. Such exercisers can emulate partial or full communication stacks which comply with the specific bus communication standard, thus allowing engineers to surgically control and generate bus traffic to test, debug and validate their designs. These devices make it possible to also generate bad bus traffic as well as good so that the device error recovery systems can be tested. They are also often used to verify compliance with the standard to ensure interoperability of devices since they can reproduce known scenarios in a repeatable way. Exercisers are usually used in conjunction with analyzers, so the engineer gets full visibility of the communication data captured on the bus. Some exercisers are designed as stand- alone systems while others are combined into the same systems used for analysis.

It has the formula Ca(C2H3O2)2. Its standard name is calcium acetate, while calcium ethanoate is the systematic name. An older name is acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic; therefore the monohydrate (Ca(CH3COO)2‚Ä¢H2O) is the common form. Production Calcium acetate can be prepared by soaking calcium carbonate (found in eggshells, or in common carbonate rocks such as limestone or marble) or hydrated lime in vinegar: :CaCO3(s) + 2CH3COOH(aq) -> Ca(CH3COO)2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) :Ca(OH)2(s) + 2CH3COOH(aq) ‚Üí Ca(CH3COO)2(aq) + 2H2O(l) Since both reagents would have been available pre-historically, the chemical would have been observable as crystals then. Uses * In kidney disease, blood levels of phosphate may rise (called hyperphosphatemia) leading to bone problems. Calcium acetate binds phosphate in the diet to lower blood phosphate levels. * Calcium acetate is used as a food additive, as a stabilizer, buffer and sequestrant, mainly in candy products under the number E263. * Tofu is traditionally obtained by coagulating soy milk with calcium sulfate.

The game was released on cassette tape and on floppy disk. Warner previously created Castle Wolfenstein for the Apple II in 1981. Gameplay The player controls a \\"firebug,\\" a 3-by-3-pixel square with a tail stretching behind it. The player picks up gas cans--each represented by a single pixel--and drops a can by pressing the joystick button. The end of the player's tail glows white, and ignites any gas can that it is adjacent to, including cans the player had dropped. Once a gas can ignites, it burst into colorful flames, which ignites any walls they touch. The goal is to burn down the highest possible percentage of the walls on the level, and escape down the stairs to the next level without touching any flames with the body of the firebug. Tail collisions with fire are expected and ignored. As the game progresses, each level features tighter mazes of walls, increasing the penalty for player mistakes; and the player's tail is shortened, causing player- dropped gas cans to explode sooner. =Visuals= Firebug uses the Apple II's lo-res graphics mode, which displays 16 colors but has a resolution of only 40 wide by 48 high. Hence, the game looks more colorful than hi-res Apple games, but the low resolution gives a crude appearance, even by the standards at the time of release. Reception Johnny L.

The name Narsaq is Kalaallisut for \\"Plain\\", referring to the shore of Tunulliarfik Fjord where the town is located.  History  People have lived in the area for thousands of years, but not continuously. Remains of the Norse settlement can be found in the area. The church ruins of Dyrn√¶s can be found on the north-western outskirts of the town. The Landn√°m homestead, Landnamsgaarden, can be found immediately to the west of the town. Dated to the year 1000, the homestead is among the oldest of the Norse ruins in the area. Excavation of the ruins began in 1953 with the discovery of the Narsaq stick, the first Viking Age runic inscription discovered in Greenland. The wider Narsaq area has some of the most striking Norse artefacts and ruins. Erik the Red's Brattahlid is located in present-day Qassiarsuk, and the Gardar bishop seat is in present-day Igaliku. Present day Narsaq was founded as Nordpr√∏ven (\\"North Pr√∏ven\\") in 1830, distinguishing it from Sydpr√∏ven (\\"South Pr√∏ven\\", modern Alluitsup Paa) established the same year. The initial settlement was founded as a trading colony of Qaqortoq, then named Julianehaab. A trading center was established here due to the natural deep water harbor which could accommodate ocean faring vessels, . Initially local seal hunters traded blubber and seal skin for continental goods, such as coffee, sugar, bread and buckwheat. Until approximately 1900 seal hunting formed the main economy for Narsaq. In the early 1900s seal hunting began to fail, and the main basis for the economy gradually shifted to fishing. The city's historical fishing village is from 1914. The main house of the historical village today houses the power company in the city. Simiutak at the Skovfjord mouth near Narsaq was a HF/DF radio range finding station called Bluie West Three during World War Two. The station commenced operations in January 1942, and was permanently manned until the end of the war. The population also increased during this period, from 25 in 1870, to 162 in 1919, and to 300 in 1930. However the settlement did not experience significant population growth until 1953, when its first prawn and fishing factory of Royal Greenland was established. The factory was subsequently closed in 2010. In 1959 the population exceeded 600, and Narsaq achieved town status,. With 1,346 inhabitants as of 2020, it is the ninth-largest town in Greenland. Several hundred people live in the surrounding community. The town is notable for the 1990 Narsaq massacre, a mass shooting where seven people were killed and one was wounded. The shooting was the worst in Greenland's history. Until December 31, 2008, the town was the administrative center of Narsaq Municipality in the Kitaa amt. In addition to the town, the municipality consisted of the Qassiarsuk, Igaliku and Narsarsuaq settlements, as well as several sheep and reindeer farms. On January 1, 2009, Narsaq became part of Kujalleq municipality, when the Kitaa amt, as well as the municipalities of Narsaq, Qaqortoq, and Nanortalik ceased to exist as administrative entities.  Economy  Colorful houses of Narsaq = Fishing = Fishing is the mainstay of the local economy. Local fjords are full of marine life, including whales, salmon, and seals. = Sheep farming = Uniquely in Greenland, farming is possible on the plains to the north of the town, with several actively maintained arable fields. Of the 53 registered sheep farms in Greenland, 31 are located in the Narsaq area. The farms produce meat for domestic consumption, and the Narsaq slaughterhouse Neqi A/S, a wholly owned subsidiary of KNI, is the only slaughterhouse in the country. The sheep farming area of Tasiusaq is located in former Norse area. = Tourism = The third major part of the economy is tourism. South Greenland has experienced a decline in tourist revenue in recent years, but tourism still supports a significant percentage of the viable workforce. Popular activities include hiking, fishing, collecting rare minerals and taking boat trips to the ice cap.  Services and infrastructure  Church in Narsaq Today Narsaq has a town hall, two supermarkets, a church, a police station, a firestation, a primary school, several educational facilities, an internet caf√©, a hospital, and several small shops. Greenland's first brewery, Greenland Brewhouse, was established in Narsaq in 2004. The town hospital is housed in a two-storey building and has 14 beds. The town health services also include a dental clinic. Narsaq church was designed by local carpenter Pavia H√∏egh in 1927. The church was refurbished and expanded in 1981. The only Food Science College in the country is located in Narsaq. The school, INUILI, is the main education center for chefs in Greenland, and it has a staff of 20.  Transport  = Air = Air Greenland provides air connections to Qaqortoq and Narsarsuaq Narsaq Heliport operates year-round, linking Narsaq with Qaqortoq on the shores of Labrador Sea, and thus with Arctic Umiaq off-season route endpoint. It also links Narsaq with the large Narsarsuaq Airport, and indirectly with the rest of Greenland and Europe. = Sea = The harbor of Narsaq is a natural coastal harbor with steep depth. Narsaq is a port of call for the Arctic Umiaq Line coastal ship in the summer season. The port can accommodate deep seagoing vessels due to the steep depth of the shore. The port authority for Narsaq is Royal Arctic Line, located in Nuuk. Port pilotage is available upon request, and is recommended. = Land = Narsaq in January In contrast to the rest of Greenland, the wider Narsaq area has a relatively extensive network of traversable dirt and gravel roads, totalling over 120 kilometers and requiring DKK 500,000 annually for service. The longest stretch of road envelopes the northern end of Tunulliarfik Fjord, and connects the sheep farms of Qassiarsuk with the airport of Narsarsuaq. The roads are generally of poor construction, lacking crossfall for drainage, and using softer sandstone instead of harder granite, creating severe dust problems in the summer. For general transportation all-terrain vehicles are recommended. During winter dog sled routes are important transport links to the surrounding area.  Population  With 1,346 inhabitants , Narsaq is the second-largest town in the Kujalleq municipality. The population has decreased 25% relative to the 1990 levels, and has been decreasing over the last several years. Most towns and settlements in southern Greenland exhibit negative growth patterns over the last two decades, with many settlements rapidly depopulating.Statistics Greenland, Population in localities Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.8) ImageSize = width:1334 height:210 PlotArea = height:150 left:50 bottom:50 right:50 AlignBars = justify DateFormat = x.y Period = from:1300 till:1900 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:100 start:1300 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:20 start:1300 PlotData= color:yellowgreen width:38 mark:(line,white) align:center bar:1991 from:start till:1830 text:\\"1,830\\" bar:1992 from:start till:1742 text:\\"1,742\\" bar:1993 from:start till:1740 text:\\"1,740\\" bar:1994 from:start till:1753 text:\\"1,753\\" bar:1995 from:start till:1781 text:\\"1,781\\" bar:1996 from:start till:1737 text:\\"1,737\\" bar:1997 from:start till:1709 text:\\"1,709\\" bar:1998 from:start till:1725 text:\\"1,725\\" bar:1999 from:start till:1702 text:\\"1,702\\" bar:2000 from:start till:1708 text:\\"1,708\\" bar:2001 from:start till:1728 text:\\"1,728\\" bar:2002 from:start till:1693 text:\\"1,693\\" bar:2003 from:start till:1699 text:\\"1,699\\" bar:2004 from:start till:1705 text:\\"1,705\\" bar:2005 from:start till:1764 text:\\"1,764\\" bar:2006 from:start till:1723 text:\\"1,723\\" bar:2007 from:start till:1691 text:\\"1,691\\" bar:2008 from:start till:1668 text:\\"1,668\\" bar:2009 from:start till:1627 text:\\"1,627\\" bar:2010 from:start till:1604 text:\\"1,604\\" bar:2011 from:start till:1598 text:\\"1,598\\" bar:2012 from:start till:1581 text:\\"1,581\\" bar:2013 from:start till:1503 text:\\"1,503\\" bar:2014 from:start till:1514 text:\\"1,514\\" bar:2015 from:start till:1528 text:\\"1,528\\" bar:2016 from:start till:1492 text:\\"1,492\\" bar:2017 from:start till:1397 text:\\"1,397\\" bar:2018 from:start till:1365 text:\\"1,365\\" bar:2019 from:start till:1374 text:\\"1,374\\"  Climate  Narsaq has a tundra climate (ET) with cool summers and cold winters.

Originally it was a cryptolanguage of ofenyas or , old Russian peddlers, and had a number of names, or it might come from the Russian word —Ñ–µ–Ω or fen which is the west wind. There are no convincing explanations about the origins of the words \\"ofenya\\" and \\"fenya\\". In modern Russian language it is also referred to as blatnoy language (Russian: –±–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–π —è–∑—ã–∫), where \\"blatnoy\\" is a slang expression for \\"criminal\\". It is also widely used in \\"thieves' songs\\". Overview The grammar of fenya is Russian; the vocabulary has changed over time. The original fenya consisted of broken Russian words borrowed from Greek and other foreign languages. Vladimir Dahl in his Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language gives the following examples: *\\"–†–æ–ø–∞ –∫–∏–º–∞—Ç—å, –ø–æ–ª—É–º–µ—Ä–∫–æ—Ç, —Ä—ã—Ö–ª–æ –∑–∞–∫—É—Ä–µ—â–∞—Ç –≤–æ—Ä—ã—Ö–∞–Ω—ã.\\" () *:Normative Russian: \\"–ü–æ—Ä–∞ —Å–ø–∞—Ç—å, –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—á—å; —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ –∑–∞–ø–æ—é—Ç –ø–µ—Ç—É—Ö–∏.\\" () *:Translation: \\"It's time to go to bed, it's midnight, soon the roosters will be crowing.\\" *\\"–î–∞ –ø–æ–∑–∞–≥–æ—Ä–±–∏–ª –±–∞—Å–≤–µ —Å–ª–µ–º–∑–∏—Ç—å: –∞—Å—Ç–æ–Ω–∞ –±–∞—Å–≤–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —É—Ö–∞–ª–∏–ª–∞ –¥—Ä—è–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–µ–π.\\" () *:Normative Russian: \\"–î–∞ –ø–æ–∑–∞–±—ã–ª —Ç–µ–±–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å: –∂–µ–Ω–∞ —Ç–≤–æ—è –ø–æ–º–µ—Ä–ª–∞ –≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ—é.\\" () *:Translation: \\"Oh, I forgot to tell you: your wife died this spring.\\" Also, fenya included usual Russian words in unusual meanings, like —à–∞–±–ª–æ–Ω shablon (template) for military or police headwear, –ø–µ–¥–∞–ª—å pedal' for mobile phone (recent addition). The vocabulary changed over time, with notable infusion of words of Yiddish origin. During the times of the Soviet Union fenya penetrated into common spoken Russian and can no longer be considered cryptic, although it is still commonly associated with those who have connections to the Russian criminal culture or who have spent a significant amount of time incarcerated. A number of explanations for this phenomenon are suggested. For one, a significant part of the population, not necessarily criminals, went through labor camps, and massive indiscriminate amnesties after the death of Joseph Stalin resulted in a penetration of the subculture of convicts into everyday life in the form of a shock wave.Examples of certain Russian language expressions' analysis can be found in The Gulag Archipelago Particularly, many writers, poets, and journalists who had been arrested began to use fenya in their work after release. Another reason comes from the fact that criminal life was romanticized in popular culture: for example, in the form of \\"blatnaya song\\". Few \\"common\\" Russians possess a complete or even complex understanding of fenya and fewer still - for various reasons - will admit to it. Fenya influences Russian culture in different ways. In particular, a whole subgenre of Russian humour exists, in which a known tale, such as Romeo and Juliet or a popular Russian fairy tale is cast into fenya. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the appearance of \\"New Russians\\" introduced new changes into fenya, notably assigning new meanings and accents to common words. In January 2016, the use of profanity and fenya by prisoners in pretrial detention centers was banned in the Russian prison system. This follows a 2013 ban on the use of fenya by prison guards.

Its overall length is with an mean outflow near the mouth into the lower Rhine of . Description The Emscher has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher are Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine. At the centre of a vast industrial area with 5 million inhabitants the river is biologically dead, as it was used as an open waste-water canal from the end of the 19th century. The partial collapse of many coal mines along the Emscher's route made the option of subterranean sewer pipes running alongside unworkable, as they would break too easily. Owing to the steady flow of spoil from the mining industry it has been impossible for the route of the Emscher to be maintained and its mouth into the Rhine has shifted north twice. A large wastewater treatment plant at its mouth treats the water of the Emscher before it flows into the Rhine. Restoration Since the early 1990s, efforts to restore the Emscher to its natural state have been making headway. The last coal mine () was closed in December 2018. Now that coal mining near the route of the river has halted, a large underground pipe is being built along the path of the river. The first stretch of the river to be restored is that in the city of Dortmund. The overall project is headed by the public water board Emschergenossenschaft. The financial cost is estimated to be 4.5 billion Euro and the expected completion date for the main work is 2020.

From 1933 to 1955, she was Editor of The Nation magazine. Background George W. Kirchwey was Kirchwey's father Born in Lake Placid, New York in 1893 as the Progressive Era was getting under way, Kirchwey was the daughter of pacifist Columbia Law Professor George W. Kirchwey. She attended Barnard College from 1911 to 1915. Career Oswald Garrison Villard (1930) was editor of The Nation before Kirchwey Kirchwey began working locally in journalism after graduation, at the New York Morning Telegraph, Every Week magazine, and the New York Tribune. In 1918, she was brought to The Nation by then editor Oswald Garrison Villard, largely at the behest of Kirchwey's former professor at Barnard, Henry Raymond Mussey, first working in the International Relations Section. In 1922 she became managing editor. In 1925 Kirchwey, an active feminist, published Our Changing Morality, a collection of articles dealing primarily with changing sexual relations. In 1926 she launched These Modern Women, a set of essays portraying successful feminist lives, including work by Crystal Eastman. Kirchwey also wrote articles in The Nation about early feminists Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul. She succeeded Villard as editor of the magazine in 1933, first as part of a four-person committee, then as the sole editor, becoming the first woman at the top of the masthead of a national weekly newsmagazine. In 1937, she bought the magazine from Maurice Wertheim, who had purchased it from Villard in a brief and particularly contentious period of the magazine's history. As editor, Kirchwey was strongly supportive of Roosevelt's New Deal and later broke with Villard in her support of Roosevelt's involvement in World War II. She was strongly supportive of the anti-Franco faction during the Spanish Civil War and supported the creation of an independent Jewish state. Her opposition to fascism led to a strong belief in the value of strong ties to the Soviet Union, opposing fascism in general and Nazism more specifically. Kirchwey criticized the Soviet invasion of Finland, stating \\"The horrors that fascism wreaked in Spain, are being repeated, in the name of peace and socialism, in Finland\\". On the domestic front, she was a sharp critic of the House Un-American Activities Committee ‚Äî calling Martin Dies Jr., its leader from 1938 to 1944, a \\"one-man Gestapo from Texas\\" ‚Äî and the growth of McCarthyism in America. In 1944, some 1,300 people, including President Roosevelt and Albert Einstein, attended a testimonial dinner honoring Kirchwey's 25 years at The Nation. Another attendee was journalist Dorothy Thompson, who in a speech praised Kirchwey for having the courage \\"to throw light into dark places and to defend the people versus those interests that in our society have repeatedly striven to defeat the full realization of the promise of democracy.\\" At the end of World War II, Kirchwey called on the United States and the Soviet Union to work together in international affairs, and argued that the certainty of nuclear proliferation meant the great powers must pool their sovereignty in a world government (\\"We face a choice between one world or none.\\")http://www.thenation.com/article/atom-bomb-one-world-or-none Louis Fischer resigned from the magazine afterwards, claiming Kirchwey's foreign coverage was too pro-Soviet. As a result of this evolution in the magazine's politics, both The Nation and its editor were criticized strongly, and some readers canceled their subscriptions, claiming The Nation was \\"pro-Communist\\". This criticism was repeated even at times by members of the American left; Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. famously referred to the magazine's \\"wretched apologies for Soviet despotism.\\" The magazine's political marginalization, however, also had financial consequences, becoming a significant financial drain by the early 1940s. As a result, Kirchwey sold her individual ownership of the magazine in 1943, creating a nonprofit organization, Nation Associates, formed out of the money generated from a recruiting drive of sponsors. Nation Associates ran the magazine and also conducted research and organized conferences. In 1951, Kirchwey brought Carey McWilliams to work for The Nation. Kirchwey, as president of Nation Associates, remained editor of the paper until 1955, when McWilliams became editor and George Kirstein became publisher. After 1955, Kirchwey became involved with a collection of civil rights and pacifist organizations, including the Committee for a Democratic Spain, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Committee for World Development and World Disarmament, the League of Women Voters, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Personal life In November 1915, Kirchwey married Evans Clark, then a Princeton University professor who later worked for The New York Times. They had three sons, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Death She died on January 3, 1976, in St. Petersburg, Florida. Works * The Atomic Era: Can it Bring Peace and Abundance!

Use in recorded music The SK-1 has been used by a few major recording artists for its simplicity and lo-fi sound. It became very popular in the late 1990s among the circuit bending crowd after the first guide to bending it was published by Reed Ghazala in Experimental Musical Instruments magazine, though the SK-1 was being modified as early as 1987 when Keyboard Magazine published an article on adding MIDI support. The synthesizer was one of the first pieces of equipment that Autechre had when they began recording music. Musician and score composer Michael Andrews featured a circuit bent SK-1 heavily in the Me and You and Everyone We Know musical score. The \\"Realistic Concertmate\\" version of the SK-1 is the primary synth used in the no wave / industrial band Special Interest. It was used by notable jungle artist DJ Hype for his seminal productions,All Crews: Journey's Through Jungle / Drum and Bass Culture, Brian Belle-Fortune, 2005 and rapper and producer Large Professor used it in his early years of beat-making.

Bratta was influenced by Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, and other rock and blues guitar players of the 1970s and 80s. His playing has been described as melodic, original and technically accomplished. Bratta often employed two-handed tapping, sweep picking, pinch harmonics and various whammy bar techniques. In 2003, Mike Tramp attempted to reunite with Bratta but was unsuccessful. Tramp talked about Bratta in a 2007 interview with Anarchy Music, claiming Bratta was always quiet and maintained a certain distance from the rest of the band. On February 16, 2007, Bratta gave his first live interview in over 12 years. The following points were revealed during the Eddie Trunk interview: Bratta's father went through a 5-year illness, which required a large amount of personal time and commitment on Vito's part, both emotionally and financially. In 1997, he injured his wrist and finds it painful to move his hand up and down an electric guitar's neck; however he still manages to play classical guitars without excessive discomfort. In addition, he clarified that he has never ruled out a White Lion/Mike Tramp reunion; up until now, they have simply been impossible due to family obligations and his wrist injury. In April 2007, Vito Bratta made his first public musical appearances in over 15 years, at both Friday and Saturday nights shows at the L'Amour Reunion Shows in New York. Legacy Although Bratta has not released any music since 1992, many musicians, both singers and guitar players, have continued to praise his songwriting skills and technical ability. Zakk Wylde has stated that Bratta is the only guitarist whose tapped playing he enjoys. He has also praised Vito Bratta's originality and pointed out that he considers the solo in \\"Wait\\" one of the best solos he has ever heard. Bratta's partner in White Lion, Mike Tramp, also remarked that Bratta's skills as a guitar player and songwriter were unmatched: Tramp also mentioned that many accomplished guitar players turned him down when he attempted to put together a new version of White Lion: Guitar World Magazine named Bratta one of the best 20 guitarists of the 1980s, commenting: Producer Michael Wagener called Bratta his \\"favorite guitar player\\" on February 17, 2007, when he called the Eddie Trunk show.

History In August 1966, the Board of Freeholders approved the creation of Essex County College and in September 1968, more than a year after the Newark riots, the college opened its doors to 3,400 students at 31 Clinton Street, Newark, NJ. In early 1970, after the college celebrated its first commencement, graduating 214 students, it was decided that the new main campus would be built in what is today called the University Heights district. The groundbreaking of the \\"Megastructure\\" (now called the A. Zachary Yamba Building) began in June 1972 with the grand opening occurring a little under four years later in April 1976. During this time, in June 1974, the College was officially given its accreditation by the Middles States Association of College and Schools' Commission on Higher Education. The main campus would see expansions in October 1985 (with the opening of the Gymnasium and Child Development Center), in October 1996 (with the opening of the Center for Technology), and in September 1999 (with the opening of the Clara E. Dasher Student Center). In January 1979, the West Essex Extension Center, a former elementary school, opened in West Caldwell, NJ. In 1982 an additional eight acres was purchased and, in September 1985, the newly expanded and renovated Center was unveiled. It would take another four years before the New Jersey State Department of Higher Education would grant the Center full branch campus status, transforming it into the West Essex Campus. The FOCUS Center (which opened in September 1974) and the Ironbound Center (which opened in September 1979) are two extension centers, located in Newark, which offer off-campus educational services. In December 1998, operations began at the Public Safety Academy in Cedar Grove, NJ. After the 2010 retirement of long-serving president Dr. A. Zachary Yamba, the college went through two separate presidencies in less than a handful of years which led to Yamba being brought back as an interim president in the spring of 2016. In November of that year the college was placed on warning by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education for failing to comply with standards involving institutional resources and governance. That, along with a former athletic coach having been found to have stolen $150,000.00 of college funds, led to a decline in enrollment. Dr. Anthony Munroe was hired by the college in May 2017 to succeed Yamba and help bring the institution back into compliance with the standards set by Middle States but internal issues, including the Board of Trustees rejecting several of the president's proposed appointees (including a Chief Financial Officer) led to the college being placed on probation. After a reshaping and reorganizing, Dr. Munroe and his administration were able to submit a monitoring report to Middle States on March 1, 2018, which led to a Small Team visit two weeks later where the Middle States representatives reported that the institution appeared to be in compliance with the standards for which it was placed on probation. That same month, the college laid off 20 full-time staff and eliminated 14 vacant positions in an effort to save money; like many community colleges, Essex County College has seen a significant (25% fewer compared to five years ago) decrease in enrollment. On July 2, 2018, in response to the college's actions and changes in its structure and governance, and based upon the recommendation from the Small Team's visit, Middle States reaffirmed the institution's accreditation. = Presidents = * May 1966 - Robert McCabe (1st) * January 1969 - Dr. Ellis White (2nd) * May 1971 - J.

It also offers 26 academic certificate programs. Approximately 25,000 people enroll each year in the college's various degree and non-degree programs, including job training and enrichment programs. Day, evening, weekend, and online courses are offered throughout the fall, semester winter intercession, spring semester, two summer sessions. The college's academic offerings are split up into six distinct divisions and one separate department: *Division of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics *Division of Business *Division of Health Sciences *Division of Humanities and Bilingual Studies *Division of Mathematics, Engineering Technologies, and Computer Sciences *Division of Social Sciences *Department of Nursing  Student life  Essex County College's students represent over 50 different countries. More Essex graduates transfer to Rutgers University-Newark, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Bloomfield College than any other two-year college in the state. In the fall of 1982 Phi Theta Kappa was chartered. Dozens of student organized and run clubs exist at the college, including the Short Films Club and the Future Teachers Club. Over the last decade, over one dozen Essex graduates have received Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Undergraduate Transfer Scholarships, allowing them to attend a four-year institution partially, or entirely, for free. Athletics Essex County College's athletic teams, dubbed the Wolverines, are represented in the Garden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) and Region 19 of the National Junior College Athletic Association. Men and women are able to participate in basketball, cross country, soccer, and track & field (indoor and outdoor). Essex athletes have gone on to become All- Americans. The college has also produced more than two dozen athletes who have competed at the Summer Olympics, representing various countries around the world.

The Pocumtuc (v. Pocomtuck) or Deerfield Indians were a prominent Native American tribe originally inhabiting western areas of what is now Massachusetts, especially around the confluence of the Deerfield and Connecticut Rivers in today's Franklin County. Their territory also included much of current-day Hampden and Hampshire Counties, plus areas now in northern Connecticut and southern Vermont. Their principal village, also known as Pocumtuck, was in the vicinity of the present day village of Deerfield.Hodge, Frederick W. Handbook of North American Indians. Washington, DC.: Government Printing Press, 1910. Their language, now extinct, was an R-dialect of the Algonquian language family, most likely related to the Wappinger and nearby Mahican tribes of the Hudson River Valley.Swanton, John R. The Indian Tribes of North America, pp. 23-24. Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 145. Washington DC.: Government Printing Office, 1952. Little is known about the Pocumtuck people, but it is believed they led a lifestyle similar to other tribes of New England. They would have engaged in semi-sedentary agriculture of maize, beans, and squash. They also hunted game and fished in the Connecticut River, which served as a major inland transportation route. The Pocumtuck were decimated by intertribal warfare with the powerful Mohawk, then based in present-day New York, and by smallpox epidemics after European contact. They had no immunity to the new disease and suffered high fatalities. In addition, they lost tribal members due to taking part in wars among the Dutch, English, French, and their respective Native American allies.Thomas, Peter A. In the Maelstrom of Change: the Indian Trade and Cultural Process in the Middle Connecticut River Valley: 1635‚Äì1665. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts‚ÄîAmherst, 1979 The Pocumtuck were originally allied with the Tunxis and Narragansett against Chief Uncas of the Mohegan and the Pequot. All these tribes united against the English colonists with the Wampanoag Confederacy in King Philip's War. At the close of the war, many Pocumtuck, Nipmuc, and other tribes fled to Schaghticoke, a village on the Hudson River. They remained there until the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1754, when most joined and merged into the Abenaki tribes at Saint-Fran√ßois-du-Lac, Quebec or moved further west.Spady, James O'Neil. \\"As if in a Great Darkness: Native American Refugees of the Middle Connecticut River Valley in the Aftermath of King Philip's War: 1677-1697,\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts, Vol. 23, no. 2 (Summer, 1995), 183-197. Small bands remained in Massachusetts as late as the 19th century, but most fled north or lost their tribal identity through intermarriage with other tribes and settlers. Many of the present-day Abenaki of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Canada are of part-Pocumtuck ancestry. Among the members of the Pocumtuck tribe was Chief Wawanotewat, better known as \\"Greylock.\\" A famous warrior, he continued to lead bands into Massachusetts after most of his followers had left the state.

It is west of La Garita, Colorado. The eruption that created the La Garita Caldera is among the largest known volcanic eruptions in Earth's history, as well as being one of the most powerful known supervolcanic events. Date The La Garita Caldera is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive ignimbrite flare-up in Colorado, Utah and Nevada from 40‚Äì18 million years ago, and was the site of massive eruptions about , during the Oligocene Epoch. Area devastated The area devastated by the La Garita eruption is thought to have covered a significant portion of what is now Colorado. The deposit, known as the Fish Canyon Tuff, covered at least . Its average thickness is . The eruption might have formed a large-area ash-fall, but none has yet been identified. Size of eruption The scale of La Garita volcanism was the second greatest of the Cenozoic Era. The resulting Fish Canyon Tuff has a volume of approximately , giving it a Volcanic Explosivity Index rating of 8.https://www.amazon.com/Super-Volcano-Ticking-Yellowstone- National- ebook/dp/B004GHOHO8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=supervolcano&qid;=1567800003&s;=books&sr;=1-1 By comparison, the eruption of Mount St. Helens on 18 May 1980 was in volume.Mason, et al. By contrast, the most powerful human-made explosive device ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, had a yield of 50 megatons, whereas the eruption at La Garita was about 5,000 times more energetic. However, because Tsar Bomba's reaction was complete within nanoseconds, while a volcanic explosion can take seconds or minutes, the power of the events is comparable if measured within the respective bounded timeframes. The Fish Canyon eruption was the second most energetic event to have occurred on Earth since the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The asteroid impact responsible for that mass-extinction, equivalent to 240 teratons of TNT, was approximately one hundred times more powerful than the Fish Canyon eruption. Geology The Fish Canyon Tuff, made of dacite, is uniform in its petrological composition and forms a single cooling unit despite the huge volume. Dacite is a silicic volcanic rock common in explosive eruptions, lava domes and short thick lava flows. There are also large intracaldera lavas composed of andesite, a volcanic rock compositionally intermediate between basalt (poor in silica content) and dacite (higher silica content) in the La Garita Caldera. The caldera itself, like the eruption of Fish Canyon Tuff, is quite large in scale. It is and oblong in shape. Most supervolcano calderas of explosive origin are slightly ovoid or oblong in shape. Because of the vast scale and erosion, it took scientists over 30 years to fully determine the size of the caldera. La Garita is considered an extinct volcano. La Garita is also the source of at least seven major eruptions of welded tuff deposits over a span of 1.5 million years since the Fish Canyon Tuff eruption. The caldera is also known to have extensive outcrops of a very unusual lava-like rock unit, called the Pagosa Peak Dacite, made of dacite that is very similar to that of the Fish Canyon Tuff. The Pagosa Peak Dacite, which has characteristics of both lava and welded tuff, was likely erupted shortly before the Fish Canyon Tuff. The Pagosa Peak Dacite has been interpreted as having erupted during low-energy pyroclastic fountaining and has a volume of about . These rocks were identified as lava because the unit has a highly elongated shape (1:50) and very high viscosity of the crystal-rich magma similar to those of flow-layered silicic lava. The Pagosa Peak Dacite formed by low-column pyroclastic fountaining and lateral transport as dense, poorly- inflated pyroclastic flows.

This formula is commonly abbreviated Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2. This red-coloured compound features a quadruple bond. The preparation of chromous acetate once was a standard test of the synthetic skills of students due to its sensitivity to air and the dramatic colour changes that accompany its oxidation. It exists as the dihydrate and the anhydrous forms. Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is a reddish diamagnetic powder, although diamond-shaped tabular crystals can be grown. Consistent with the fact that it is nonionic, Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 exhibits poor solubility in water and methanol. Chromium(II) acetate (aqueous solution) Structure The Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 molecule contains two atoms of chromium, two ligated molecules of water, and four acetate bridging ligands. The coordination environment around each chromium atom consists of four oxygen atoms (one from each acetate ligand) in a square, one water molecule (in an axial position), and the other chromium atom (opposite the water molecule), giving each chromium centre an octahedral geometry. The chromium atoms are joined together by a quadruple bond, and the molecule has D4h symmetry (ignoring the position of the hydrogen atoms). The same basic structure is adopted by Rh2(OAc)4(H2O)2 and Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2, although these species do not have such short M‚ÄìM contacts. The quadruple bond between the two chromium atoms arises from the overlap of four d-orbitals on each metal with the same orbitals on the other metal: the dz2 orbitals overlap to give a sigma bonding component, the dxz and dyz orbitals overlap to give two pi bonding components, and the dxy orbitals give a delta bond. This quadruple bond is also confirmed by the low magnetic moment and short intermolecular distance between the two atoms of 236.2 ¬± 0.1 pm. The Cr‚ÄìCr distances are even shorter, 184 pm being the record, when the axial ligand is absent or the carboxylate is replaced with isoelectronic nitrogenous ligands. History Eug√®ne-Melchior P√©ligot first reported a chromium(II) acetate in 1844. His material was apparently the dimeric Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2. The unusual structure, as well as that of copper(II) acetate, was uncovered in 1951. Preparation The preparation usually begins with reduction of an aqueous solution of a Cr(III) compound using zinc. The resulting blue solution is treated with sodium acetate, which results in the rapid precipitation of chromous acetate as a bright red powder. :2 Cr3+ \\\\+ Zn ‚Üí 2 Cr2+ \\\\+ Zn2+ :2 Cr2+ \\\\+ 4 OAc‚àí \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 The synthesis of Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 has been traditionally used to test the synthetic skills and patience of inorganic laboratory students in universities because the accidental introduction of a small amount of air into the apparatus is readily indicated by the discoloration of the otherwise bright red product. The anhydrous form of chromium(II) acetate, and also related chromium(II) carboxylates, can be prepared from chromocene: : 4 RCO2H + 2 Cr(C5H5)2 ‚Üí Cr2(O2CR)4 \\\\+ 4 C5H6 This method provides anhydrous derivatives in a straightforward manner. Because it is so easily prepared, Cr2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is a starting material for other chromium(II) compounds. Also, many analogues have been prepared using other carboxylic acids in place of acetate and using different bases in place of the water. Applications Chromium(II) acetate has few practical applications. It has been used to dehalogenate organic compounds such as Œ±-bromoketones and chlorohydrins. The reactions appear to proceed via 1e‚àí steps, and rearrangement products are sometimes observed. Because the compound is a good reducing agent, it will reduce the O2 found in air and can be used as an oxygen scrubber.

It was composed as a love song to Jim Morrison's first serious girlfriend, Mary Werbelow, shortly after their relationship ended. The song's title borrows from the 12th-century Irish Lebor na hUidre (Book of the Dun Cow) manuscript. The lyrics in the opening verse resembles a conventional love song, while the later verses are vague in intention and contain more challenging imagery. A music video was later compiled from footage of the band performing on American Bandstand, coupled with film of Morrison and Pamela Courson at Kern River, near Bakersfield, California. Lyrics Morrison's lyrics are often deliberately vague, and this, coupled with the song's dreamlike atmosphere, has led to speculation as to the meaning of \\"The Crystal Ship\\". According to Greil Marcus, the opening lines \\"Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss\\" could be about \\"sleep, it could be an overdose, inflicted by the singer or the person he's addressing; it could be murder suicide, or a suicide pact.\\" Critic James Perone noted that the song's title is open to wide interpretations, and that the crystal ship \\"could just as easily represent sleep as a drug trip\\". He conceded that \\"in 1967 the latter would probably have been the more common interpretation\\". A January 1990 letter to the Los Angeles Times claimed that the song was about crystal methamphetamine, with the ship representing a hypodermic needle, and the kiss the act of drug injection. John Densmore responded by saying that although Morrison was aware that \\"crystal\\" is slang for methedrine, he \\"wrote 'The Crystal Ship' for Mary Werbelow, a girlfriend with whom he was breaking up: it was therefore intended as a goodbye love song.\\" According to local Santa Barbara, California, lore, Morrison wrote the song after taking LSD on an Isla Vista beach one night as he stared at the blinking lights of an offshore oil rig named Platform Holly.

Similarities with Smalltalk Magik itself shares some similarities with Smalltalk in terms of its language features and its architecture: the Magik language is compiled into byte codes interpreted by the Magik virtual machine. The Magik virtual machine is available on several platforms including Microsoft Windows, various flavours of Unix and Linux. Magik is console based and code can be modified on the fly even when an application is running. The console can also be used to execute Magik code and to see the results. Compiled code is stored in a single file called an image file. Each image file holds the compiled byte-codes and the state of the session (for example variable values) when the image was last saved. Language features =Comments= Magik uses the \`#\` token to mark sections of code as comments: # This is a comment. =Assignments= Magik uses the \`<<\` operator to make assignments: a << 1.234 b << b + a c << \\"foo\\" + \\"bar\\" # Concat strings For clarity, this notation is read as \\"a becomes 1.234\\" or \\"b becomes b plus a\\". This terminology separates assignment from comparison. Magik also supports a compressed variation of this operator that works in a similar way to those found in C: b +<< a # Equivalent to b << b + a To print a variable you can use the following command a << \\"hello\\" write(a) =Symbols= As well as conventional data types such as integers, floats and strings Magik also implements symbols. Symbols are a special token data type that are used extensively throughout Magik to uniquely identify objects. They are represented by a colon followed by a string of characters. Symbols can be escaped using the vertical bar character. For example: a << :hello # whenever :hello is encountered, it is the same instance b << :hello world =Dynamic typing= Magik variables are not typed as they are in say C# and can reference different objects at runtime. Everything in Magik is an object (there is no distinction between objects and primitive types such as integers): a << 1.2 # a floating point number is assigned to variable 'a' a << \\"1.2\\" # later, a string is assigned to variable 'a' ;Objects Objects are implemented in Magik using exemplars. Exemplars have similarities to classes in other programming languages such as Java, but with important differences. Magik supports multiple inheritance, and mixins (which implement functionality with no data). New instances are made by cloning an existing instance (which will typically be the exemplar but does not have to be). New exemplars are created using the statement \`def_slotted_exemplar()\`, for example: def_slotted_exemplar(:my_object, { {:slot_a, 34}, {:slot_b, \\"hello\\"} }, {:parent_object_a, :parent_object_b}) This code fragment will define a new exemplar called \`my_object\` that has two slots (or fields) called \`slot_a\` (pre-initialised to 34) and \`slot_b\` (pre- initialised to \\"hello\\") that inherits from two existing exemplars called \`parent_object_a\` and \`parent_object_b\`. =Comparison= Magik implements all usual logical operators (\`=\`, \`<\`, \`<=\`, \`>\`, \`>=\`, \`~=/<>\`) for comparison, as well as a few unusual ones. The \`_is\` and \`_isnt\` operators are used for comparing specific instances of objects, or object references rather than values. For example: a << \\"hello\\" b << \\"hello\\" a = b # returns True (_true) because the values of a and b are equal a _is b # returns False (_false) because a is not the same instance as b a << \\"hello\\" b << a a = b # returns True (_true) because the values of a and b are equal a _is b # returns True (_true) because b was assigned the specific instance of the same object as a, rather than the value of a. =Methods= Methods are defined on exemplars using the statements \`_method\` and \`_endmethod\`: _method my_object.my_method(a, b) _return a + b _endmethod It is convention to supply two methods \`new()\` (to create a new instance) and \`init()\` (to initialise an instance). # New method _method person.new(name, age) _return _clone.init(name, age) _endmethod # Initialise method. _private _method person.init(name, age) # Call the parent implementation. _super.init(name, age) # Initialise the slots. .name << name .age << age _return _self _endmethod The \`_clone\` creates a physical copy of the \`person\` object. The \`_super\` statement allows objects to invoke an implementation of a method on the parent exemplar. Objects can reference themselves using the \`_self\` statement. An object's slots are accessed and assigned using a dot notation. Methods that are not part of the public interface of the object can be marked private using the \`_private\` statement. Private methods can only be called by \`_self\`, \`_super\` and \`_clone\`. Optional arguments can be declared using the \`_optional\` statement. Optional arguments that are not passed are assigned by Magik to the special object \`_unset\` (the equivalent of null). The \`_gather\` statement can be used to declare a list of optional arguments. _method my_object.my_method(_gather values) _endmethod =Iteration= In Magik the \`_while\`, \`_for\`, \`_over\`, \`_loop\` and \`_endloop\` statements allow iteration. _block _local s << 0 _local i << 0 _while i <= 100 _loop s +<< i i +<< 1 _endloop >> s _endblock Here, the _while is combined with _loop and _endloop. _method my_object.my_method(_gather values) total << 0.0 _for a _over values.elements() _loop total +<< a _endloop _return total _endmethod m << my_object.new() x << m.my_method(1.0, 2, 3.0, 4) # x = 10.0 Here values.elements() is an iterator which helps to iterate the values. In Magik generator methods are called iterator methods. New iterator methods can be defined using the \`_iter\` and \`_loopbody\` statements: _iter _method my_object.even_elements() _for a _over _self.elements() _loop _if a.even? _is _true _then _loopbody(a) _endif _endloop _endmethod =Procedures= Magik also supports functions called procedures. Procedures are also objects and are declared using the \`_proc\` and \`_endproc\` statements. Procedures are assigned to variables which may then be invoked: my_procedure << _proc @my_procedure(a, b, c) _return a + b + c _endproc x << my_procedure(1, 2, 3) # x = 6 =Regular Expression= Magik supports // regular expression syntax: _if /Hello\\\\,\\\\s(\\\\w)+!/.matches?(\\"Hello, Magik!\\") _then write(\\"Got a match!\\") _endif and to capture groups in Regex: /sw([0-9]+)-([0-9]+).*/.replace_all(\\"sw65456-324sss\\", \\"$1\\") # \\"65456\\" /sw([0-9]+)-([0-9]+).*/.replace_all(\\"sw65456-324sss\\", \\"$2\\") # \\"324\\" =HTTP Library= Magik supports making HTTP or HTTPS requests via http library, see below examples: magikhttp << http.new() magikhttp.url(\\"https://www.google.com\\").get() magikhttp.url(\\"https://www.google.com\\").post({\\"User-agent\\", \\"Bot\\"}, \\"some data\\") =Language Quirks= Because Magik was originally developed in England, methods in the core smallworld libraries are spelled using British English. For example: Use \\"initialise\\", not \\"initialize\\". =Collections= Like other programming language Magik too has collections. They include the following: *Simple Vector *Rope *Hash Table *Property List *Equality set *Bags Hello World example The following is an example of the Hello world program written in Magik: write(\\"Hello World!\\") References External links *Smallworld Product Suite Technology *MDT - Magik Development Tools IDE for GE Smallworld GIS developers *Open Source (SourceForge) *Language forum post on Magik *Technical Paper No. 5 - An Overview of Smallworld Magik *GE Smallworld, Emacs Extensions for Magik developers Category:Class-based programming languages Category:Dynamically typed programming languages ","title":"Magik (programming language)"},{"id":"2988759","text":"David W.

His mother died after giving birth to him. His father, unable to cope with the loss of his wife, left Gabriel and his brother Roberto to be cared for by their aunts. He studied painting at the Academia de San Carlos, and at the age of 16 he became interested in photography thanks to Jos√© Guadalupe Velasco. He later befriended other photographers, such as Gilberto Mart√≠nez Solares and Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez Solares, and these three would then move on to cinematography. Figueroa made his entry in the movie industry in 1932 as a photographer of stills for the film Revoluci√≥n of Miguel Contreras Torres. He was later one of the 20 cinematographers hired for the Howard Hawks film Viva Villa!. After a few jobs he obtained a scholarship to study in the United States where the established director of photography Gregg Toland taught Figueroa. Back in Mexico, his first film was Fernando de Fuentes's All√° en el Rancho Grande (1936) which would become one of the most popular films in Mexico and Latin America, and gave him his first award at the Venice Film Festival. He filmed 235 movies over 50 years, including Los Olvidados by Luis Bu√±uel, The Fugitive by John Ford, R√≠o Escondido by Emilio Fern√°ndez, and The Night of the Iguana by John Huston for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1964. One of his main collaborators was Fern√°ndez, with whom he shot twenty films, some of which won prizes at the Venice Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival, and the Berlin Film Festival. After collaborating with Fern√°ndez and Bu√±uel on their films with such actors as Dolores del R√≠o, Pedro Armend√°riz, Mar√≠a F√©lix, Jorge Negrete, Columba Dom√≠nguez, and Silvia Pinal, Figueroa has come to be regarded one of the most influential cinematographers active in M√©xico.

In a 1993 interview with Ivor Kenny in the book Talking to Ourselves, Fanning described himself as a classical liberal who was opposed to both Ulster loyalist and Provisional IRA terrorism. Fanning also expressed a strong advocacy of the free market, arguing that the goal of a good newspaper is to be as commercially successful as possible: > \\"If three or four papers out of 15 are successful and the others are not, > they might say they're not driven by the market, they have some higher > vocation: to serve the public interest or some pompous stuff like that. > That's how they feel good about themselves.

Oakland Business Review, MLive.com. Retrieved on January 17, 2008. The mall completed a major remodel and expansion in 2007. History = Planning and Opening = Planning for the mall began in 1967 when the J.L. Hudson Corporation purchased land at the intersection of 12 Mile and Novi roads. Prior to its development as a mall, the site was proposed to be used as a landfill. Opposition by residents and the then-Village of Novi prevented the establishment of the landfill. Another mall proposal in Farmington Township (now Farmington Hills) was proposed by The Taubman Company and Homart Development. Sears was signed on to anchor the proposed shopping center, and Hudson's was rumored to anchor the mall as well. The mall was to be located at Thirteen Mile Road, between Haggerty and Halsted, and set to open in 1974. Opposition to the proposed mall in Farmington Township pushed the developers west to the current location in Novi. Twelve Oaks Mall was then developed as a joint venture between A. Alfred Taubman, Homart Development, and the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, Excavation of the site began in the spring of 1975, and construction began later that fall. The mall opened on August 2, 1977, anchored by Hudson's, with Sears opening on October 1, 1977, Lord & Taylor on March 6, 1978, and finally JCPenney on May 3, 1978. The mall was designed by Gruen Associates, founded by the pioneer of the American shopping mall Victor Gruen, and Richard Prince. The head builder was Richard Marrone. The mall is one of three super-regional Taubman malls built in Metro Detroit during the late 1970s, the other two being Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights and Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn. The center court in Twelve Oaks Mall. = 21st Century = In 2001, Hudson's converted to Marshall Field's. In 2002, The Taubman Corporation demolished the defunct United Artists Theatres and made way for a new \\"Lifestyle Cafe\\" food court, and allowed kiosks in the mall for the first time. This marked a change in Taubman policy, as it was originally believed that a food court would invite teenage loitering and that kiosks diminished the upscale atmosphere of the mall. In 2005, The Taubman Corporation announced a $63 million expansion project, which includes a of common space, and a new Nordstrom store. The expansion made Twelve Oaks Mall one of Taubman's largest mall properties. Construction began in February 2006, with Clark Construction Company taking on the project. Also in 2006, Marshall Field's converted to Macy's, and expanded to 300,000 sq ft. In September 2007, the new Nordstrom opened with over 40 small specialty shops. The new anchor store was built on the southeast side of the mall, adjacent to the existing Lord & Taylor store. In January 2013, The Cheesecake Factory announced that it would open at the mall later that year, and it opened on August 13, 2013. In 2018, H&M; moved to a two floor space in the Sears wing from its original location in the JCPenney wing. It is the first two-level H&M; store in Michigan. On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed in March 2019. In 2020, Crate & Barrel relocated their location at Somerset Collection in Troy to Twelve Oaks. A temporary location in the original H&M; space opened on February 6 while the permanent location in the upper level Macy's wing is being constructed. In February 2020, Simon Property Group planned to acquire Twelve Oaks Mall, along with Taubman's other malls, but the deal was terminated in June. On August 2, 2020, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would be closing as part of a plan to close all 38 stores nationwide. Twelve Oaks underwent renovations in 2007 that included additional internal lighting around the mall's existing skylights. The Twelve Oaks water tower visible from I-96.

The character first appears in Giant-Size Defenders #3 (Jan. 1975) and was created by Steve Gerber and Jim Starlin. Publication history Korvac debuted in Giant-Size Defenders #3 (1975), and according to creator Gerber: \\"The character really was a throwaway, created for one story. And I never intended to bring him back, because, among other things, I hated the name! I still think it sounds more like a vacuum cleaner than a villain\\". However, Roger Stern and Len Wein felt that Korvac, being a native of the 31st century, made a natural adversary for the Guardians of the Galaxy, and wrote a story in Thor Annual #6 (1977) which was intended to set him up in that role. The Guardians of the Galaxy's own series, Marvel Presents, was cancelled before Thor Annual #6 was published, cutting off Stern's plans to use Korvac there. Korvac instead appeared in Avengers #167, 168, 170‚Äì177 (January‚ÄìNovember 1978), later called the \\"Korvac Saga\\". The eleven issues were written by Jim Shooter and David Michelinie, with art by George P√©rez and David Wenzel. A trade paperback edition reprinted the Korvac Saga in 1991, and included a new epilogue written by Mark Gruenwald and drawn by Tom Morgan. Although the revised conclusion cast Korvac as a villain, it was removed by editor Tom Brevoort when reprinted as Avengers Legends Volume 2: The Korvac Saga in 2003. Korvac reappeared briefly in Avengers Annual #16 (1987). He is heavily referenced in a 1991 summer annual crossover storyline: Fantastic Four Annual #24 (1991); Thor Annual #16 (1991); Silver Surfer Annual #4 (1991) and Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #1 (1991). The character returned in Captain America vol. 3, #17‚Äì19 (May‚ÄìJuly 1999). Korvac also appeared in both volumes of the alternate universe title What If?, in issues #32 (April 1982) and vol. 2, issue #36 (April 1992). Korvac made a return to the mainstream 616 universe in Avengers Academy #11 (March 2011). To tie-in with the movie Captain America: The First Avenger, an all-ages retelling of the Korvac Saga was issued in December 2010 and ended in March 2011 titled Captain America: The Korvac Saga. The story was condensed and focused primarily on Captain America journeying to the future in pursuit of Korvac with the help of Nikki and Firelord. Fictional character biography =Early exploits= Michael Korvac is a computer technician in the alternate universe Earth-691.The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Worlds 2005 When the Sol System and its colonies are conquered by the alien Badoon in AD 3007, Korvac becomes a collaborator and traitor to the human race. Caught asleep at a machine while working, the Badoon punish Korvac by grafting his upper body to a machine, effectively making him a cyborg. Korvac is then transported through time by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster, who utilizes him as a pawn in battling the hero Doctor Strange and the Defenders.Giant-Size Defenders #3 (Jan. 1975) It is eventually revealed that Korvac deliberately lost the fight so he can be able to discreetly scan and analyze the Grandmaster's cosmic power. Gaining several new abilities from this analysis, Korvac then kills his Badoon masters and plans to conquer the cosmos. Korvac recruits a group of aliens called the \\"Minions of Menace\\" and attempts to cause Earth's sun to go nova, but is defeated by the Guardians of the Galaxy and the time-traveling Thunder God Thor.Thor Annual #6 (1977) =\\"The Korvac Saga\\"= Korvac flees across time and space to the Earth-616 universe. Upon arrival, Korvac discovers the space station of the entity Galactus. While attempting to download the knowledge of Galactus from the station into his own system, Korvac is imbued with the Power Cosmic and becomes god-like. Korvac then recreates himself as a perfect humanoid form, and posing as a human called \\"Michael\\", travels to Earth with the intent of reshaping it into a utopia. Korvac, however, is pursued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who join forces with the superhero team the Avengers in a bid to stop the villain. Guardian member Starhawk finds Korvac and battles him in secret. Korvac, however, disintegrates Starhawk and then recreates him, but removes from the hero the ability to perceive Korvac in any way so as to avoid future detection. The Elder of the Universe known as the Collector foresees the coming of two beings that would be capable of challenging the Elders (Korvac and Thanos), and remakes his own daughter Carina into a being of incredible power to use as a weapon against them. Carina does meet Korvac, but the two fall in love and she begins to sympathize with him. The Collector is defeated by the Avengers after a failed bid to \\"collect\\" and protect the heroes from Korvac, who upon discovering the Collector's plot disintegrates the Elder. Iron Man eventually tracks Korvac to a residential neighborhood in Forest Hills Gardens, in Queens, New York City, New York. The entire Avengers roster, aided by the heroine Ms. Marvel, and the Guardians of the Galaxy, confront Korvac and Carina, who pose as a middle class couple. Korvac's deception is revealed when Starhawk states he cannot see the man called \\"Michael\\". Realizing that he has been discovered, and that cosmic entities such as Odin and the Watcher are now aware of his existence, Korvac is forced into battle. Korvac slays wave after wave of heroes, and is finally caught off guard and weakened by Captain America and Wonder Man. Although able to kill the heroes, Korvac is weakened further by the combined efforts of Starhawk, Iron Man, the Vision and Thor. Sensing that Carina now doubts him, Korvac commits suicide through an act of will. An angered Carina attacks the surviving heroes, but is finally slain by Thor. The entire battle is watched by part-time Avenger Moondragon, who realizes that Korvac only wanted to help mankind, with his dying act being to restore the Avengers and Guardians to life.Avengers #167‚Äì177 (Jan.‚ÄìNov. 1978) Korvac's and Carina's souls then passed into the realm of Death where they are watched over by Master Order and Lord Chaos.The Korvac Saga TPB epilogue =\\"The Korvac Quest\\"= It is revealed that Korvac discarded his power when near death after sensing that Galactus had activated the weapon the Ultimate Nullifier in retaliation for his previous intrusion. Korvac's suicidal act of will preserves his power and consciousness, which is sent forward through time to inhabit various descendants of his. Starhawk becomes aware of this, and the Guardians of the Galaxy pursue Korvac's essence through time. The power eventually reaches the year 2977 AD and inhabits Michael's father, Jordan, who is killed in battle with the Guardians. Jordan's widow, Myra, vows to teach the infant Michael that the Guardians were responsible for his father's death on the day of his birth.Fantastic Four Annual #24; Thor Annual #16; Silver Surfer Annual #4 and Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #1 (all 1991) =Later appearances= Korvac is briefly resurrected in human form by the Grandmaster to battle Silver Surfer.Avengers Annual #16 (1987) When Korvac's attempt to use Captain America in a scheme to steal the power of a Cosmic Cube from Red Skull ultimately failed, Red Skull used his internalized Cube power to scatter Korvac across six dimensions.Captain America vol. 3, #19 (July 1998) In Avengers Academy, Korvac's wife Carina was mistakenly resurrected by Veil (believing that she is helping to resurrect Wasp). Korvac returns for her and Hank Pym offers to return Carina to Korvac, but she refuses to go with him, choosing nonexistence over him (even though she is apparently immortal, as is her father). A battle commences pitting Korvac against all current Avengers teams. He is weakened by them and then attacked by adult versions of the Academy's students.Avengers Academy #11 After a brutal battle, Veil phases into his body, which temporarily paralyzes Korvac, and Hazmat then completely annihilates Korvac with a projected blast of anti-matter.Avengers Academy #12 Powers and abilities Korvac was originally a normal man until the Badoon amputated the lower half of his body and grafted his upper body and nervous system onto a specialized computer module capable of siphoning energy from virtually any source. Korvac's mechanical module could also tap and synthesize any form of energy and concealed advanced weaponry. After downloading information from Galactus' ship and acquiring the Power Cosmic, Korvac is capable of energy projection, matter alteration, teleportation, astral projection, and manipulation of time and space. In his perfect human form, Korvac retained all his cosmic abilities and could use these to achieve virtually any effect. Michael Korvac is also a brilliant computer scientist, a master strategist, and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. In other media =Television= * Korvac appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, voiced by Troy Baker. This version is a modern-day human who gained powers from the Kree after he was abducted and experimented upon by them. His only appearance is in the episode \\"Michael Korvac\\", in which he crashes to Earth, creating a crater in the middle of Central Park. Two police officers find him and take him to the Avengers Mansion, hoping that the Avengers can help him. When Wasp answers the door, Korvac mistakes her for his beloved Corrina. He explains to Wasp that he was abducted by aliens but escaped from their ship. Wasp tracks down Corrina and brings her to the mansion, where she informs Korvac that he has been gone for two years. When the Guardians of the Galaxy show up at the mansion to capture Korvac, the Avengers (consisting of Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Wasp, the Black Panther, and Ms. Marvel) attack the Guardians to protect him. However, during the battle Star-Lord explains the truth about Korvac to Hawkeye. When they try to explain to the rest of the Avengers, an enraged Korvac attacks and defeats both the Guardians and the Avengers. After helping the Avengers escape, the Guardians explain that Kree experiments drove Korvac insane, and that he is wanted for killing thousands of sentient beings across the universe. A short time later, the Avengers and the Guardians team up against Korvac again only to be defeated a second time. Corrina attempts to reason with him, and reveals to him that she is terrified of what he has become. Realizing that Corrina thinks of him as a \\"monster\\", Korvac leaves Earth. At the end of the episode, he is floating in the deepest parts of space visibly expressing regret of his past actions for all eternity. * Korvac appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\", voiced by James Marsters. This version is an intergalactic warlord and the leader of the Chitauri. Taking notice of the powerful figures on the planet Earth, including the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and Doctor Strange, Korvac set out to destroy the planet before those heroes had a chance to stop him. The Guardians of the Galaxy, with the help of Nova and Spider-Man, were able to stop his diabolical plan, destroy his flagship, and presumably kill Korvac in the process. * Korvac appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode \\"Unfortunate Son\\", voiced by Wil Wheaton. This version is a human-shaped alien scientist who was in love with the A.I. Rora until he upgraded himself to an A.I. system on his space station ever since Rora was stolen from him by J'son. Korvac mistakes Star-Lord for J‚Äôson, and takes his teammates hostage, secretly turning them into his mindless drones. When Star-Lord, J‚Äôson, and Rora arrive Korvac has J‚Äôson also transformed into one of his drones. Star-Lord takes the Guardians and J‚Äôson onto the Milano while Rora causes the space station to explode, seemingly killing Korvac. =Video games= * Korvac appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Avengers (2016). * Korvac appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. When Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Star-Lord confront a hologram of Kang the Conqueror on Damocles' bridge, Kang deactivates Damocles to crash it and leaves the three superheroes a parting gift in the form of Korvac. Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Star-Lord defeat Korvac who disappears upon his defeat and escape from Damocles before it can crash into the ground.

As fans were not receptive to the angle, Kitano and New Japan parted ways, which left Wakita and his fellow dojo students, the future Jado and Gedo, without a home.

As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically. It is believed that the social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the \\"gesuiwerde\\" (purified) and \\"smelter\\" (fusionist) factions within the National Party and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the South African Party. The sudden lack of demand destroyed prices on commodities that were profitable to many Afrikaner farmers. For example, the price of wool fell 75% between 1925 and 1933. A large portion of the agricultural industry were unable to repay mortgages on their over-capitalized farms. Thus, the National Party found itself losing favour with one of its largest constituencies--conservative, rural Boers. South Africa was saved from a complete collapse by the gold mining industry-- one of the largest and most advanced at the time--as the price of gold rose rapidly as investors sought a haven from the dead securities market. Growing gold exports compensated somewhat for the loss of other trade revenue. However, like the situation with the Boers, the National party lost support as the weak economy forced the gold corporations to replace white labourers with lower-paid blacks. The National Party-led government staved off bankruptcy by raising taxes on imports, petrol and postage, amongst other things. This \\"unfair\\" taxation led to further dislike of the ruling government. The coalition government between Jan Smuts and J.B.M. Hertzog was successful in 1933 partly because Smuts presented the public with a mock budget showing how South Africa's economic malaise could be lifted by floating the South African pound and removing it from the Gold standard, thus making exports more attractive, and creating a scenario in which undue taxation could be removed.

Early life and education Alexander was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Spencer (n√©e Buck) and William V. Alexander Sr. He grew up in Osceola, Arkansas, graduating from Osceola High School in 1951, and became an Eagle Scout the same year. He attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, before earning a B.A. from Southwestern at Memphis University (now Rhodes College) in 1957 and a LL.B from Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville in 1960. Career He subsequently clerked for Judge Marion S. Boyd of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. He served in the U.S. Army JAG Corps. Alexander practiced law in Memphis and Osceola, was a commissioner on the Arkansas Waterways Commission, and secretary of the Osceola Port Authority.

It is considered to be one of the wealthiest streets in the world. The road is often referred to by its nickname of \\"Billionaires' Row\\". The 66-house street runs downhill north‚Äìsouth and with the parallel Winnington Road displays a variety of architectural styles. Average property prices on the avenue surpassed ¬£1 million in the late 1980s and each property occupies a 2-3 acre plot.New London Property Guide In 2006, the smallest houses in the street were selling for ¬£5 million while a larger house, Turkish tycoon Halis Toprak's Toprak Mansion, sold amidst great secrecy to the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, for ¬£50 million in January 2008, making it one of the most expensive houses in the world, as listed by Forbes magazine. Homes on the street are on the market for up to ¬£65 million.Booth, Robert (31 January 2014). \\"Inside 'Billionaires Row': London's rotting, derelict mansions worth ¬£350m\\". The Guardian (London). Retrieved 8 February 2014. Together with Winnington Road and Ingram Avenue, it is named after Arthur Winnington-Ingram, who as Bishop of London owned much of the surrounding area following a land grant in 1904. Most of the land was sold privately in the early 20th century, and today only one house on the road is owned by the Church (46, The Bishops Avenue) and a nearby residential home. The Bishops Avenue is home to monarchs, business magnates, and celebrities. An estate agent for the area, Trevor Abrahmsohn, said in 2006: \\"Among the wealthiest circles in the world, The Bishops Avenue is better known than Buckingham Palace. It's a significant demonstration of status. If you live there, you don't need to explain to people that you're rich.\\" The Guardian revealed in 2014 that in total 16 of the properties (an estimated worth of ¬£350 million) are derelict and have not been lived in for several decades. According to one resident, perhaps only three of the houses are occupied on a full-time basis. Most of the properties in the most expensive part of the avenue are registered to companies in tax havens including the British Virgin Islands, Cura√ßao, the Bahamas, Panama, and the Channel Islands, allowing international owners to avoid paying stamp duty on the purchase and to remain anonymous. Residents Owners of houses on the street include the Sultan of Brunei and members of the House of Bolkiah, publisher and newspaper magnate Richard Desmond, art collector and philanthropist Poju Zabludowicz, industrialist Lakshmi Mittal, and property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou. Former residents of the street have included Sir Billy Butlin, Dame Gracie Fields, Katie Boyle, Sir Peter Saunders (producer of the play The Mousetrap), the businessmen Asil Nadir and Emil Savundra and Heather Mills (the former wife of Paul McCartney), who owned an apartment there. Ten of the houses on the street owned by the House of Saud were sold for ¬£73 million.

The majority of Bangladeshi Americans are Bengalis and form the largest group of Bengali Americans. Bangladeshi immigrants have arrived in the United States in large numbers since the early 1970s to become among the fastest growing ethnic communities since that decade. New York City, home to two-thirds of the Bangladeshi American population; Paterson, New Jersey; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Buffalo, New York; as well as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, Chicago, Florida, Dallas, Houston, Charlotte, Austin and Hamtramck, Michigan are home to notable Bangladeshi communities.  History  Immigrants from present-day Bangladesh have been in the United States since at least the 1880s. Bangladeshis have been migrating to the port cities of the United States since 1974 when 154 Bangladeshi arrived in United States leaving behind the hard economic and political times of the still developing Bangladesh who got independence from Pakistan in 1971. Most were workers on the various ships docking from Chittagong, Bangladesh. Immigration to the United States from Bangladesh grew slowly but steadily through the 1970s and 1980s. Over ten thousand Bangladeshis have immigrated to the United States annually. Many of the migrants settled in urban areas. New York City is home to two-thirds of the Bangladeshi population in the United States. Other cities including Paterson and Atlantic City, New Jersey, Buffalo, New York, as well as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Detroit. In New York, it was estimated that 15,000 Bangladeshis resided in the city in the early 1980s. During the late 1970s, some Bangladeshis moved from New York City to Detroit, and Atlantic City for jobs. Homes to prominent communities of other Muslim Americans, in search of better work opportunities and an affordable cost of living, but most have since returned from Detroit to New York and to New Jersey, in hope of starting a new community and a peaceful life. The Los Angeles Bangladesh Association was created in 1971, and there were 500 members of the Texas Bangladesh Association in 1997. In Atlantic City, Bangladeshis created an association. The Bangladeshi population in Dallas was 5,000 people in 1997, which was large enough to hold the Baishakhi Mela event. Baishakhi Mela events have been held in major American cities such as New York City, Paterson in New Jersey, Atlantic City, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, as the Bangladeshi population continues to increase in these cities.Other Immigrants: The Global Origins of the American People. By David M. Reimers. page 198-200. The third and largest wave of arrivals came in the 1990s and 2000s. Because of the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, professional and educational criteria were not used . Most entered blue-collar jobs, such as taxi driving, and restaurant help.J. Sydney Jones, \\"Bangladeshi Americans.\\" (2014)  Demographic  =Gender imbalance= As of 1980, most Bangladeshi immigrants were between 10 and 39 years old. Sixty-two percent are men, the imbalance being due to employment opportunity differences and custom that discourages the emigration of single women. Approximately 50% of men and 60% of women are married upon arrival to the United States. Political leanings Bangladeshi Americans tend to favor the Democratic Party, influenced in part by Republican President Richard Nixon's support of Pakistan during Bangladesh's struggle for independence. =New York City= See also: Indians in the New York City metropolitan region New York City is home to the largest Bangladeshi community in the United States, receiving by far the highest legal permanent resident Bangladeshi immigrant population. The Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in New York City, counting over 74,000 by 2011 alone. The city's Bangladeshi community is spread out in the Jackson Heights neighborhood within the New York City borough of Queens. 74th Street has most of the Bangladeshi grocery stores and clothing stores in Jackson Heights. The Bangladesh Plaza hosts numerous Bangladeshi businesses and cultural events. Recently, one part of Jackson Heights has become the open platform of all sorts of protests and activism. The neighboring communities of Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Elmhurst in Queens also similarly have become attractive areas to live for Bangladeshi Americans. Since the 1970s, thousands of Bangladeshis were able to legally migrate to the USA through the Diversity Visa Program/ lottery. Many initiated a migration to Jamaica, Queens. Continuous movement of Bangladeshis to Jamaica and Jackson Heights, Queens has made some neighborhoods extensively Bangladeshi. Centering on 169 street and Hillside Avenue, the neighborhood has become a popular zone due to the large number of restaurants and groceries. Sagar Restaurant, Gharoa, Deshi Shaad, Kabir's Bakery, and other stores in Queens are attractions for the Bangladeshi communities all over New York City. The largest numbers of Bangladeshi Americans now live in Jamaica, Jackson Heights, Hollis, and Briarwood in Queens. Bangladeshi enclaves in Queens and Brooklyn have been increasing as Bangladeshis in NYC continue to grow rapidly. Bangladeshis form one of the fastest growing Asian ethnic groups in NYC as new enclaves in areas such as City Line and Ozone Park have sprung up. Wealthier Bangladeshis have been moving to Long Island, New York City, as a particular reason for popular settlement in the area is the pharmaceutical companies existing on Long Island; there are quite a large number of Bangladeshi-owned pharmaceutical companies in Nassau County and Suffolk County on Long Island employing many people of Bangladeshi origin. However, there have been a relatively small number of cases where Bangladeshis living in New York City moved out, specifically to places such as Buffalo, New York and Hamtramck in Michigan, mainly due to low living costs.

Parkchester and Castle Hill in The Bronx is also home to an increasing Bangladeshi population Other, smaller Little Bangladesh communities can be found in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Los Angeles. =Paterson, New Jersey= Paterson, New Jersey, in the New York City metropolitan area, is home to the second largest Bangladeshi American population, after New York City. Paterson, New Jersey, in the New York City metropolitan area, is home to a significant and growing Bangladeshi American community. Many Bangladeshi grocery stores and clothing stores are locating in the emerging Little Bangladesh on Union Avenue and the surrounding streets in Paterson, as well as a branch of the Sonali Exchange Company Inc., a subsidiary of Sonali Bank, the largest state-owned financial institution in Bangladesh. Masjid Al-Ferdous is also located on Union Avenue, which accommodates Paterson's rapidly growing Bangladeshi pedestrian population in Paterson. Mohammed Akhtaruzzaman was ultimately certified as the winner of the 2012 city council race in the Second Ward, making him northern New Jersey's first Bangladeshi-American elected official.Clunn, Nick. \\"Officials certify election of Akhtaruzzaman to Paterson's 2nd Ward\\", The Record, 27 November 2012.

The Shohid Minar was completed and unveiled in 2015. This project reflected the increasing influence of Paterson's growing Bangladeshi community, as reported in The Record. Community and economic issues =Per capita income= In 2014, identified by factfinder census, when Americans per capita income was divided by ethnic groups Bangladeshi Americans were revealed to have a per capita income of only $18,027, below the American average of $25,825. =Median household income= As of 2015, Bangladeshi Americans had an estimated median household income of $49,800, lower than the overall American median of $53,600. =Poverty= According to a news article from the website Mashable released in 2015, it stated that reported that 26% of the Bangladeshi American community lived under the poverty line. This is much higher than the USA average of 16% according to data released by the Economic Policy Institute in 2011. In a 2013, NPR discussion with a member of the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of the book The Myth of the Model Minority Rosalind Chou who is also a professor of sociology. One of them stated that \\"When you break it down by specific ethnic groups, the Hmong, the Bangladeshi, they have poverty rates that rival the African-American poverty rate.\\" Education The New York City Metropolitan Area is home to by far the largest Bangladeshi population in the United States. The 2000 census undertaken by the Census Bureau listed 57,412 people identifying themselves as having Bangladeshi origin. Almost 40% of Bangladeshis over the age of 25 had at least a bachelor's degree as compared to less than 25% of the United States population.  Culture  Bangladeshi Americans retain a strong ethnic identity but are known to assimilate into American culture while at the same time keeping the culture of their ancestors. Bangladeshi Americans are well represented in the fields of medicine, engineering, business, finance and information technology. Bangladeshi Americans have brought Bengali cuisine to the United States, and Bengali cuisine has been established as one of the most popular cuisines in the country with hundreds of Bengali restaurants in each major city and several similar eateries in smaller cities and towns. There are many Bangladeshi markets and stores in the United States. Some of the largest are in New York City, Paterson, New Jersey, Central New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Atlantic City, and Los Angeles. =Languages= Bangladeshi Americans often retain their native language Bengali and run many programs to nourish their mother tongue. However, many also speak Bengali dialects or other languages related to Bengali, the most common being Sylheti which is spoken by people from the Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, and Chatgaya which is spoken by Bangladeshis from Chittagong. =Religion= Before the colonization of India by Great Britain, folk religion across the Bengal region incorporated elements of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam to varying degrees. By the time of the Partition of Bengal, Bengalis began to classify themselves with one religion or another. In smaller towns in America, Bangladeshi Americans will pray at home and make trips to attend their mosque or temple during major holidays. In major cities, Bangladeshi Americans who are Muslim hold religious services in their own mosques. There are also a number of major Hindu temples in the United States where Bangladeshi Americans play an important part in the leadership of their congregations. Due to the legacy of Buddhism as well as the Bengal Renaissance, many Bangladeshi Americans continue traditions of humanism and identify as non-religious, secularist, atheist, agnostic, and gnostic.

First purchased from General Motors in 1959 and the last one acquired in 1983, they remain in the current non-active fleet. These buses were the longest-serving buses in the TTC fleet, with the last one retiring in 2011. Purchase and rebuilds New Look buses were purchased by the TTC from 1960 to 1983. From the 1970s to 1980s they were the primary bus type in the TTC fleet. Even with newer models, the New Look continue to ply Toronto streets. They were rebuilt between 1997 and 2002. The overhaul was necessary because of a shortage of buses the commission experienced after increased ridership in the late 1990s. All were numbered in the 8xxx series before their 18-year rebuild. They were renumbered to clear out the 8xxx category for the soon-to-be-arriving 80xx series, and to show that their lives had been extended. The buses were equipped with brown vinyl bench seating, but it was later replaced with red fabric seats during the overhaul. The destination signs which had been displayed on rollsigns were replaced with digital Luminator Matrix signs.

Focusing specifically on race in education, racial identity development in teenagers, and assimilation of black families and youth in white neighborhoods. Tatum uses works from her students, personal experience, and psychology learning. Tatum served from 2002 to 2015 as the ninth president of Spelman College, the oldest historically black women‚Äôs college in the United States. Tatum is the author of the widely acclaimed book \\"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria\\" And Other Conversations About Race, in which she argues that Americans are reluctant to talk about issues of race, and that we must begin to consider the psychological effects of racial identity development. In her more recent 2007 book, Can We Talk about Race? and Other Conversations in an Era of School Resegregation, Tatum again highlights the urgent need for conversations about race, emphasizing the continued racial segregation of schools and the impacts that this has on achievement of racial minorities. Early life Beverly Christine Daniel Tatum was born on September 27, 1954, in Tallahassee, Florida. Her parents were Catherine Faith Maxwell and Robert A. Daniel. Tatum calls herself an \\"integration baby\\", having been born only four months after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling on Brown v. Board of Education that outlawed race-based segregation in schools. Tatum grew up in Bridgewater, Mass., where she recalls usually being the only black student in her classes. Much of her family, including her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents attended some of the best historically black colleges, such as the Tuskegee Institute and Howard University. However, when Tatum graduated high school in 1971, she was not limited to only historically black colleges and universities. Beverly Tatum earned a B.A. in Psychology from Wesleyan University. She also received her M.A. in Clinical Psychology in 1976 from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D in clinical Psychology in 1984, also from the University of Michigan. Much later in 2000, she received an M.A. in religious studies from Hartford Seminary. Academic career Tatum initially taught Black Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara from 1980 to 1983. She then went on to be a professor of Psychology at Westfield State College (1983-1989), and later served as a professor of Psychology for thirteen years at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. While at Mount Holyoke, she was also appointed as chair of the Psychology department, Dean of the College, Vice President for Student Affairs, and acting President of the College. In the fall of 2002, Tatum became the President of Spelman College, a historically black liberal arts women‚Äôs college located in Atlanta, Georgia. Her tenure there was marked by many successes, including a 10-year campaign that increased the alumni donation rate up to 41%, and raised $157.8 million. Tatum has brought her expertise in the realm of racial identity development to lectures, workshops, and panels across the country, even speaking as a panel member at the Summit on Race Relations and America‚Äôs Public Education System, a publicly broadcast conversation about race relations that was hosted by President Bill Clinton. In addition to being a renowned educator and author, Tatum also worked as a practicing clinical psychologist from 1988 to 1998. Her area of expertise was in diversity training and multicultural organizational development, which she would carry out in individual and group sessions. Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum retired in July 2015 as President Emerita of Spelman College. She now hopes to focus on work as an author, lecturer, and expert of racial identity development. Race and education In Beverly Tatum‚Äôs widely cited article Talking about Race, Learning about Racism: The Application of Racial Identity Development Theory in the Classroom, published in the Harvard Educational Review, she describes her experiences teaching classes on race related issues, and applies Racial Identity Development Theory as a framework that is useful for understanding common student responses to such topics. She summarizes her career-long commitment to teaching about and leading discussions on race at various institutions in the following quote: \\"I was convinced that helping students understand the ways in which racism operates in their own lives, and what they could do about it, was a social responsibility that I should accept.\\" Over her many years as an educator, Tatum taught a course titled \\"Psychology of Racism\\" eighteen times at three separate institutions. While the class sizes, the institutions, and the students varied a great deal, Tatum says that classes shared a common thread in how the students tended to react to the material. She describes how students often responded to such topics emotionally, expressing guilt, shame, and anger, all of which had the potential to prevent them from engaging with and appreciating the material. Tatum argues that students tended to resist the topic of race in part because it is considered taboo, but also because it clashes with meritocratic ideals that are prominent in America, and because white students often fail to recognize that race has meaningfully impacted each of their lives. Tatum explains this resistance further in terms of William E. Cross, Jr.‚Äôs Racial Identity Development theory, a theory that explores the psychological effects of coming to terms with one‚Äôs racial group membership. Racial identity theories have been modeled for blacks and whites, but these theories vary markedly in terms of the developmental stages by which they are defined. As a professor, Tatum has observed many students go through these stages of racial identity development, and provides quotes from journal entries in which the students react to the class discussions and material over the course of a semester. In presenting these journal entries, Tatum reveals that while students go through their own personal evolution in response to topics of race, their experiences also tend to map onto racial identity theory quite well. Tatum argues that the model, while imperfect, is a very useful tool that enables students to frame their experiences in a meaningful way, thereby facilitating positive student development. Tatum touches on many of these same issues in her popular book \\"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?\\" And Other Conversations About Race. In the book, she offers a detailed overview of racial identity development in black individuals and white individuals, and briefly addresses racial identity development of Native Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans. She draws on vivid personal anecdotes of interactions with her own children and students, as well as empirical literature, to build a case for the relevance and significance of racial identity development in terms of achievement, mental health, and inclusion. Tatum emphasizes the need for educators, parents, and the general public to educate themselves about such topics in order to meaningfully hold conversations about race, specifically as it relates to education. Legacy In 2014, the American Psychological Association presented Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum with the Award for Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology, the highest honor presented by the APA. The citation for the award stated the following: \\"you have engaged the very difficult subject of race relations in the United States, and the impact of such an environment on identity development for African Americans.\\" Indeed, Tatum has dedicated much of her career to conversations with the public on the subjects of race and racial identity development. As a result, she has become a nationally renowned expert on such issues, and has been invited to speak and conduct workshops at various institutions across the country. Tatum has also clearly left her mark at Spelman College, where she served as President for 13 years. Since the beginning of her tenure in 2002, the overall scholarship support for students at Spelman has doubled. Tatum was also involved in the initiative \\"Going Global\\", which seeks to develop student intercultural competencies through infrastructural support for Global study-travel programs. In 2012, she launched a Wellness revolution, which was designed to empower students to make healthy choices relating to exercise, diet, and sleep. And in 2014, Tatum helped the college to raise 157.8 million dollars, an amount that far exceeded fundraising goals and was the most money to have been fundraised in the history of the institution.

The series tells the story of a teenage girl named Amy Winston who discovers she is the orphaned princess of the magical land of Gemworld. She also learns that its evil ruler, Dark Opal, is out to destroy her and so she travels to Gemworld to overthrow him. Publication history Amethyst's premise was initially pitched to DC Comics under the title \\"Changeling\\", wherein its main character had been left on Earth as an infant. However, because another DC superhero formerly named Beast Boy was currently using that name at the time, Dan Mishkin decided on the alternative \\"Amethyst\\" as a replacement. This in turn inspired the jewel- themed renaming of the other characters in the series and the conceptual rebranding of the entire concept as \\"Gemworld\\".Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld issue 2, page 26. Amethyst first appeared as a special insert preview in The Legion of Super-Heroes #298 (April 1983). Her original story began shortly afterward in the twelve-issue Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld limited series in 1983, written and created by Dan Mishkin and Gary Cohn with Ernie Col√≥n as the artist. The initial 12-issue limited series (identified by DC Comics as a \\"maxi-series\\") establishes Gemworld, Amethyst's identity, and several of her recurring villains. The limited series was followed by a 1984 annual and a sixteen-issue ongoing series. The ongoing series was followed by the 1986 Amethyst Special one-shot and a four-issue limited series that ended the character's adventures (pencilled by Esteban Maroto). There was also a one- shot with Superman in DC Comics Presents #63 (Nov. 1983).When Amethyst met Superman The character re-emerged in 2005 after 18 years of sporadic appearances, in the Infinite Crisis mini-series. In June 2012 it was announced that Amethyst would make her debut in the rebooted The New 52 DC Universe as the main character of the new Sword of Sorcery. This lasted until May 2013, when Sword of Sorcery was cancelled. Fictional character biography Princess Amethyst, the daughter of the ruling House of Amethyst, was orphaned by Dark Opal of the House of Opal. Following the death of Amethyst's parents, the witch Citrina whisks her away to be reared in safety by the Winston family on Earth. At the age of thirteen, Amethyst is attacked by Dark Opal. After her return to Gemworld, Amethyst discovers her magical powers and decides to use them to rebel against Dark Opal's oppression over Gemworld. Upon befriending the winged unicorn Max, Amethyst journeys in search of allies among The Twelve Kingdoms of Gemworld that do not support Dark Opal. She is successful in rallying support from most of the other Houses and gains friendship in Lord Topaz, Lady Turquoise, and Princess Emerald (Emmy). The first series ends with the defeat of Dark Opal, the liberation of Gemworld, and Amethyst's return to Earth. During the second series released in 1986 it is revealed that in the aftermath of Dark Opal's defeat, conflict among the other Royal House of Gemworld caused friction throughout the surrounding kingdoms. The Lords of Chaos attempt to capitalize on Amethyst's absence and threatens to overtake Gemworld. During this time, Amethyst learns from Doctor Fate that she is a member of the Lords of Order as her father was. Amethyst is unique among the Lords as the only creation with a truly human form. After struggling with this revelation, she finally accepts her destiny and battles the Lord of Chaos known as The Child and his servant Flaw, the Gemstone Golem. After defeating Flaw, Amethyst ends the battle between herself and The Child by merging him with Gemworld. As a consequence, she is forced to merge with The Child. The Amethyst miniseries sees the characters' return from their fates and takes place about two decades after Crisis on Infinite Earths (time passes differently in Gemworld). When 20 years of time pass in the Gemworld dimension, only 13 years time will pass on Earth. Lord Topaz and Lady Turquoise are married and have three children: twin sons Wrynn and Donal, and four-year-old daughter Amber. The miniseries also sees the rise of Mordru in the form of Wrynn when he accidentally summons Flaw back to life. With the help of Flaw and The Lords of Chaos, Mordru transforms himself into a powerful sorcerer. He would become Amethyst's greatest enemy and goes on to plague the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th Century. After his transformation into Mordru, Wrynn sets off on conquest which eventually leads to a confrontation with Amethyst and in which Flaw is destroyed. Amethyst pursues Wrynn across Gemworld where they battle a second time. Meanwhile, The Child has returned and abducted a now adult Emmy from Earth. He plans to use her as leverage for Mordru in order to defeat Amethyst. The ploy eventually fails as Donal arrives to help Amethyst, who is able to temporarily restore Wrynn to his former self. Wrynn begs Donal to free him from Mordru's influence by killing him. Before Donal is able to fulfil the request he is distracted by Topaz's objections. This distraction allows Mordru to regain control of Wrynn and kill Donal. Enraged, Amethyst pulls The Child out of Emmy's body and banishes him back to Gemworld. In the final issue of the miniseries Mordru is sentenced to banishment from The Twelve Kingdoms of Gemworld following his defeat. Amethyst, dissatisfied with this sentence and angry over Donal's murder, banishes Mordru into Gemworld by merging him with the planet where he remains for many years. Amber is revealed to be Amethyst's daughter, not Topaz and Turquoise's. Realizing that the end of her time on Earth has brought imbalance to the forces between order and chaos, Amethyst charges Emmy with the care of her daughter and takes them both back to Earth. Amethyst returns to Gemworld and merges with the planet. By displacing the Gemworld into Earths universe, the setting is a \\"possible\\" future +13 years following the Crisis on Infinite Earths series. Time passes and the Gemworld is renamed Zerox. Late in the 30th century, Zerox (The Sorcerers World) is destroyed by an entity battling the Legion of Super Heroes in LSH series (1984) #61,#62,#63,#64 (The Magic Wars). The planet is reduced to asteroid rubble and Amethyst is killed. During the Infinite Crisis storyline, Amethyst is first seen battling the Spectre on Gemworld in Infinite Crisis #2 and survived the attack. She later appears among the magical beings who are summoned to reconstruct the shattered Rock of Eternity in the Day of Vengeance Special. Amethyst is seen once again in Infinite Crisis #6 where she and other sorcerers pool their powers to summon the restored Spectre to Stonehenge. In the aftermath of Infinite Crisis, all of the other Lords of Order are apparently destroyed by the Spectre, signaling the end of the Ninth Age of Magic and leaving Amethyst as the only known surviving Lord of Order in the Tenth Age of Magic. Infinite Crisis erases the events of the 1987 Amethyst four issue mini series. Amethyst never goes into 20 years (13 years Earth time) of crystal glass hibernation and is awakened prematurely by the Spectre. Amber (her magical construct daughter) is never created. Her friend Princess Emerald, the Gemworld royal families, and Earth family have unknown fates. Further illustrating that time line is deleted, Mordru (a Chaos immortal in human form) exists many years before his \\"creation\\" in the Gemworld \\"origin\\" back story (a contradiction); The villain has battles against Dr. Fate and the Justice Society following the Post-Crisis time. About 4 years of DC comics time passes between Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis. In the revised continuity, the Gemworld (Zerox) is not destroyed during the 30th century. =The New 52= In 2012, DC relaunched the long defunct Sword of Sorcery title as part of The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe) with Amethyst as the lead story written by Christy Marx with art by Aaron Lopresti. In this version, Amethyst is Princess Amaya of House Amethyst, taken to Earth and raised as Amy Winston by her mother Lady Graciel in order to protect her from Amaya's ruthless aunt Mordiel, who has usurped control of their house.Sword of Sorcery #1-8 (w)Christy Marx (a)Aaron Lopresti Amethyst later joins the Justice League Dark upon being brought to Earth in an effort to reconnect Tim Hunter with magic.Justice League Dark Annual #1 Amethyst remains on the team in order to recover the portal stone that John Constantine has stolen. She is told not to trust any promises Constantine has made. Soon after, she has an adventure while exploring the House of Mystery with her allies Black Orchid and Frankenstein. They destroy several malicious threats that try to devour them.Justice League Dark #14 (Jan. 2013) During the \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, Amethyst is among the superheroes that feel the disturbance in the magical plane when Shazam picks up Pandora's Box.Justice League Dark #23 =Wonder Comics= In 2019, DC relaunched the Young Justice title, with Amethyst as one of the members. On this Gemworld, there is no time difference passing between dimensions. If one day passes on Earth, then only one day passes on the Gemworld. Dark Opal exists as an ongoing villain and apparently has never died. Currently, there is a new six issue mini series Amethyst (2020) by Amy Reeder. Powers and abilities Amethyst possesses a host of powers, including flight, spell-casting, energy manipulation, matter transmutation and can tap other sources of magical energy to amplify her own powers. She is powerful enough to engage in battle with the Spectre and survive.Infinite Crisis #2 Collected edition In 2012, DC published an Amethyst volume of the Showcase Presents series. It reprinted the character's appearances in The Legion of Super-Heroes #298, the original Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld 12-issue limited series, Amethyst Annual #1, DC Comics Presents #63, and the first 11 issues of the 16-issue ongoing Amethyst series.

Introduced by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget through his cognitive-developmental stage theory, centration is a behaviour often demonstrated in the preoperational stage. Piaget claimed that egocentrism, a common element responsible for preoperational children's unsystematic thinking, was causal to centration. Research on centration has primarily been made by Piaget, shown through his conservation tasks, while contemporary researchers have expanded on his ideas. Conservation Tasks Piaget used a number of tasks to test children's scientific thinking and reasoning, many of which specifically tested conservation. Conservation refers to the ability to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size. Other conservation tasks include conservation of number, substance, weight, volume, and length. Perhaps the most famous task indicative of centration is the conservation of liquids task. In one version, the child is shown two glasses, A1 and A2, that are filled to the same height. The child is asked if the two glasses contain the same amount of liquid, in which the child almost always agrees that they do. Next, the experimenter pours the liquid from A2 to glass P, which is lower and wider. The child is then asked if the amount of liquid is still the same. At the preoperational stage, children will respond that the amount is not the same, with either the taller glass or the wider glass containing more liquid. Once the child has reached the concrete operational stage, however, the child will conclude the amount of liquid is still the same. Here, centration is demonstrated in the fact that the child pays attention to one aspect of the liquid, either the height or the width, and is unable to conserve because of it. With achievement of the concrete operational stage, the child is able to reason about the two dimensions simultaneously and recognize that a change in one dimension cancels out a change in the other. In the conservation of numbers task, Piaget gave children a row of egg cups and a bunch of eggs, placing them in rows of equal length, but not equal number. Piaget then asked the children to take just enough eggs to fill the cups, and when the children attempted to do so, they were surprised to find that they had too many or too few eggs. Again, centration is present here, where the child pays attention to the length of the rows and not the numbers within each row. Children demonstrated conservation of weight and length through a similar task. In this one, children were shown two balls of Playdoh that were equal in size. When asked whether they were the same or not, all children answered that yes, they were. Afterwards, Piaget rolled one of the balls into a longer string and asked the same question: ‚ÄúWhich one is bigger?‚Äù. Children who centrated focused on the length of the newly shaped Playdoh, or the width of the old Playdoh, and often said that one or the other was bigger. Those children who were able to focus on both dimensions, both length and width, were able to say that both clumps of Playdoh were still the same size. Egocentrism Piaget believed that in each period of development, a deficit in cognitive thinking could be attributed to the concept of egocentrism. Egocentrism, then, refers to the inability to distinguish one's own perspective from that of others, but does not necessarily imply selfishness or conceit. In speech, children are egocentric when they consider matters only from their own perspective. For example, a young egocentric boy might want to buy his mother a toy car for her birthday. This would not be a selfish act, as he would be getting her a present, but it would be an action that did not take into account the fact that the mother might not like the car. The child would assume that his mother would be thinking the same thing as himself, and would therefore love to receive a toy car as a gift. Animism ‚Äì the attribution of life to physical objects ‚Äì also stems from egocentrism; children assumed that everything functions just as they do. As long as children are egocentric, they fail to realize the extent to which each person has private, subjective experiences. In terms of moral reasoning, young children regard rules from one perspective, as absolutes handed down from adults or authority figures. Just as the egocentric child views things from a single perspective, the child who fails to conserves focuses on only one aspect of the problem. For example, when water is poured from one glass into a shorter, broader one, the child ‚Äòcenters‚Äô on a single striking dimension ‚Äì the difference in height. The child cannot ‚Äòdecenter‚Äô and consider two aspects of the situation at once. Centration, essentially, can be seen as a form of egocentrism in specific tasks involving scientific reasoning. Perseveration While centration is a generally tendency for children within various cognitive tasks, perseveration, on the other hand, is centration in access. Perseveration can be defined as the continual repetition of a particular response (such as a word, phrase, or gesture) despite the absence or cessation of a stimulus. It is usually caused by brain injury or other organic disorder. In a broader sense, perseveration is used to describe a wide range of functionless behaviours that arise from a failure of the brain to either inhibit prepotent responses or to allow its usual progress to a different behavior. This includes impairment in set shifting and task switching in social and other contexts. Perseveration and centration are connected, in that centration is a basis for perseveration, but perseveration itself is seen to be a symptom of injury. Where perseveration is more of an issue when seen in adults, centration is a deficit in children's thinking that can be overcome more easily, through typical developmental gains. Decentration Children generally achieve conservation of liquids at about 7 years. When they do so, they are entering the stage of concrete operations. Overcoming centration can be seen in three main forms. First, the child might use the identity argument ‚Äì that you haven't added or take any away, so it has to be the same. Second, the argument of compensation might be used, where the child states that tallness of the one glass and the wideness of the other glass cancel each other out. Third, an inversion reasoning is possible, where the child might suggest they are still the same because you can pour water from the wide glass back into the tall glass to create two equal looking glasses once again. Underlying these arguments are logical operations ‚Äì mental actions that are reversible. Since these are mental actions, the child does not actually need to perform or have seen the transformations they are talking about. Piaget argued that children master centration and conservation spontaneously. The crucial moment comes when the child is in a state of internal contradiction. This is shown when the child first says that one glass has more because it's taller, than says the other has more because it is wider, and then becomes confused. Once this internal contradiction is resolved by the child themselves, by taking into account multiple aspects of the problem, they decenter and move up onto the concrete operational stage. Multitasking, seen through cognitive flexibility and set- shifting, requires decentration so that attention may be shifted between multiple salient objects or situations. As well, decentration is essential to reading and math skills in order for children to move beyond the individual letters and to the words and meanings presented. Other Research As shown earlier, the aspect of quantitative understanding that most interested Piaget was the child's ability to conserve quantities in the face of perceptual change. Later studies have not disproved Piaget's contention that a full understanding of conservation is a concrete operational achievement. Recent work does suggest, however, that there may be earlier, partial forms of understanding that were missed in his studies. Investigators have simplified conservation tasks in various ways. They have reduced the usual verbal demands, for example, by allowing the child to pick candies to eat or juice to drink rather than answer questions about ‚Äúsame‚Äù or ‚Äúmore.‚Äù Or they have made the context for the question more natural and familiar by embedding the task within an ongoing game. Although such changes do not eliminate the non- conservation error completely, they often result in improved performance by supposedly preoperational 4- and 5-year-olds. Indeed, in simple situations, even 3-year-olds can demonstrate some knowledge of the invariance of number. A study by Rochel Gelman provides a nice example. In her study, the 3-year-old participants first played a game in which they learned, over a series of trials, that a plate with three toy mice affixed to was a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù and a plate with two toy mice was a ‚Äúloser.‚Äù Then, in a critical test trial, the three- mice plate was surreptitiously transformed while hidden. In some cases, the length of the row was changed; in other cases one of the mice was removed. The children were unfazed by the change in length, continuing to treat the plate was a winner. An actual change in number, however, was responded to quite differently, eliciting search behaviours and various attempt at an explanation. The children thus showed a recognition that number, at least in this situation, should remain invariant. One should note, however, that studies purporting to show earlier competence on conservation tasks have themselves been criticized. In particular, these critiques suggest that methodological changes in the early competence studies may bias younger children to conserve due to lower level mechanisms. Children's complete of these tasks, therefore, may be due more to perceptual mechanisms rather than cognitive mechanisms of true conservation and an understanding of invariance. Thus, children may simply be sensitive to discriminating the delete or addition of information, rather than conserving information across changes in the display.

His book Gentle Ben was the basis for the 1967 movie Gentle Giant and the 1967-1969 television show Gentle Ben. He wrote a total of 17 published books, most of which involve as a central plot element the relationship between man and animals. Many of his works involve survival stories, or people going into the wild to \\"discover\\" themselves; redemption through nature is a common theme of Morey's works. Life and career Morey began going to school in 1912, in Jasper, Oregon. He was never very keen on school. In 1934 he began working in a veneer plant, making brushes in a paintbrush factory and doing work in the woods. On July 8, 1934, he married his first wife, Rosalind Ogden, in Portland, Oregon. Rosalind died February 28, 1977. On June 26, 1978 he married Peggy Kilburn. Early in his writing career, he also published numerous short pulp fiction stories. For much of his life, he was a boxer and diver, in addition to being an author.

Bisson opened a photographic studio in early 1841. Soon after, his brother Auguste-Rosalie Bisson (1826‚Äì1900) entered into partnership with him. Their studio was in the La Madeleine in Paris, and they became famous as the Bisson Brothers. In 1860 they accompanied Napoleon III on his visit to Savoy. The pair produced remarkable images of the local scenery. Having received an encouraging response to his work, the following year Auguste ascended Mont Blanc, taking with him twenty-five porters to carry his equipment. The photographs were made using the Collodion process, with very large negatives, often up to 30 cm x 40 cm (12\\" x 16\\") The brothers refused to reduce their images to the carte de visite size and, consequently, after four years, they ceased operating their business. One of the most famous works attributed to this artist is his photograph of composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. The origin of the portrait has never been adequately explained and, subsequently, the image was excluded from the 'Les fr√®res Bisson Photographes' exhibition at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in 1999.Copied from Robert Leggat See also *  References  Category:1814 births Category:1876 deaths Category:19th-century French photographers ","title":"Louis-Auguste Bisson"},{"id":"2989048","text":"Alex Phillips (January 11, 1900 - June 14, 1977) was a Canadian-born Mexican cinematographer and the father of Alex Phillips, Jr., also a cinematographer.

A native of Dunmore, where his father was a National School teacher, Jack Mahon had a distinguished career as a player, at the highest level. He first made a mark as a young player, winning a County Minor title with Dunmore McHales in 1949 and a Connacht Colleges championship with St. Jarlath's College, Tuam, in 1950. It was at a time when there was no All-Ireland Colleges championship played, so he did not get the opportunity to follow up on the Tuam school‚Äôs Hogan Cup triumph of 1947, inspired by his close friend Sean Purcell. Jack won the first of three County Senior championships in 1953, with a Dunmore McHales team captained by his 19-year- old brother Brian, who has since lived in Tuam. Jack‚Äôs other two Galway S.F.C. medal were won in 1961 (ending the Tuam‚Äôs Stars‚Äô seven in-a-row) and 1963. It was a dream come true for Jack when he was selected on the Galway senior football team in 1951. He played on until 1961, winning an All-Ireland medal in 1956, a National League medal in 1957, as captain, and six Connacht championships including five in a row from 1956 to 1960 - he was one of four players who lined out in all five finals; the others were Sean Purcell, Mattie McDonagh and Joe Young. He won Railway Cup medals with Connacht in 1957 and ‚Äô58 and also in ‚Äô58 he played at centre half-back on the Combined Universities team which defeated the Rest of Ireland. His team-mates included Sean Purcell and they were in opposition to some of their best friends, Frank Stockwell, Tom \\"Pook\\" Dillon, Mick Greally, John Nallen and Packy McGarty. Following Mahon's retirement from senior football in 1961, Jack went into Football administration, serving as Galway Football Board chairman in the 1980s, as P.R.O. since, and later he was given an honorary position: President of the County GAA Board.

It is situated at Fleet Street just east of the Princes' Gates at Exhibition Place. The octagonal building was originally part of a pair of lighthouses built in 1861 at Queen's Wharf, replacing an earlier 16 feet lighthouse originally built in 1838. The three-storey wood structure is one of two lighthouses at Toronto (the other being Gibraltar Point Lighthouse). History The lighthouse, which projected a red light, was designed by the architect Kivas Tully. This lighthouse, along with a second, larger white light lighthouse, marked the entrance to the Toronto harbour from 1861. The two lights were lined up to guide ships into Toronto Harbour, which had a narrow and shallow ( deep) channel over bedrock and shallow sandbars. The building is a bare frame structure and was never meant to be used as a dwelling by a lighthouse keeper, who stayed in a nearby cottage. The harbour master's residence was also nearby. The shifting in direction of the deep water channel to Toronto Harbour necessitated the moving of the red light lighthouse in 1885. Both lighthouses became redundant when a new western channel to the harbour was opened with a pair of new range lights (short tower on concrete based and taller skeletal tower).https://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1064 were deactivated in 1912. The new range lights were destroyed by fire in 1918. By 1925, the Queens Wharf lighthouse was surrounded by new lands filling in the area around the Queen's Wharf, from the water. The other lighthouse was demolished but the Toronto Harbour Commission moved the remaining lighthouse to its present Fleet Street location in 1929. The new location was on the northern approach to the old western channel. Its ownership was transferred to the City of Toronto. The lighthouse currently sits at the eastern edge of the Gore park about one block north from the current shoreline and is contained within a small Toronto Transit Commission streetcar loop. The building was listed in the Toronto Heritage Register on June 20, 1973. The Historical Board of Toronto did some restoration of the lighthouse in 1988. The light is no longer functional. Fleet Loop Fleet Loop is a turning loop, encircling the lighthouse, used for short turning the 509 Harbourfront and 511 Bathurst streetcar routes of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The lands are leased from Exhibition Place on a renewable ten-year term. When the loop first opened on June 22, 1931 it could only turn westbound streetcars back east. The loop was rebuilt in 1982 and reconfigured so that streetcars on Fleet Street could enter and exit in both directions, allowing them to return to the Exhibition Loop or loop-the-loop. Passengers cannot access vehicles here and must board streetcars at a stop just east of the loop.

Over four dozen Barber houses are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and several dozen more are listed as part of historic districts. Barber began designing houses in his native DeKalb, Illinois, in the late 1880s, before permanently moving his base to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1888. His first widely circulated catalog, Cottage Souvenir No. 2, contained designs and floor plans for fifty- nine houses, mostly in the Queen Anne style, as well as Barber's architectural philosophy and tips for homebuilders. Later catalogs contained more Colonial designs. By the time his catalog business ended in 1908, Barber had sold upwards of 20,000 plans. Barber was the father of Charles I. Barber (1887-1962), who became a successful architect in his own right, and designed a number of notable buildings in the Knoxville area during the first half of the 20th century.

By the 1870s, he owned an adjacent farm, where he raised plants which he advertised as \\"ornamental nursery stock.\\" During this period, he learned architecture through mail-order books, namely George Palliser's American Cottage Homes and technical books published by A.J. Bicknell and Company.M. Ruth Little (2009). Barber, George F. (1854-1915), North Carolina Architects and Builders, A Biographical Dictionary.

By the mid-1880s, Barber was back in DeKalb, where he produced his first architectural designs working for his brother's construction firm, Barber and Boardman, Contractors and Builders. In 1887 or early 1888, Barber published The Cottage Souvenir, crudely produced on punched card stock and tied together with a piece of yarn, which contained 14 house plans (a revised edition published shortly afterward contained 18).Barber & McMurry Architects , Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed July 18, 2010 The earliest buildings constructed from Barber's designs include the Charles E.

In late 1888, Barber relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, in hopes that the city's mountainous climate would be better for his declining health. He briefly partnered with Minnesota-born architect Martin Parmalee, but the partnership proved unsatisfactory. In 1892, he established a firm with one of his clients, J.C. White, handling the firm's business aspects. Barber also became a partner in the Edgewood Land Improvement Company, which was developing a suburb east of Knoxville known as Park City (modern Parkridge).Ann Bennett, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Park City Historic District, 22 June 1990. He designed over a dozen houses for this suburb, including his own house, which still stands at 1635 Washington Avenue, and the W.O. Haworth and F.E.

Around 1895, Barber parted ways with White and formed a new firm with a new partner, Thomas Kluttz. That year, Barber began publishing a magazine, American Homes, which advertised the firm's latest house plans, offered tips on landscaping and interior design, and published a multi-part history of architecture by Louisville architect Charles Hite-Smith. In 1896, the growing firm moved into the Barber-designed French and Roberts Building on Gay Street, with the firm's thirty draftsmen and twenty secretaries occupying an entire floor. =Later career= In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Barber designed a number of elaborate mansions for affluent businessmen, including the home of Carroll Lathrop Post (brother of C. W. Post) in Battle Creek, Michigan, the home of tobacco magnate R. J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the home of People's Bank president N.E.

Buchanan House in Lebanon, Tennessee The bulk of Barber's business followed the \\"catalog architecture\\" model popularized by earlier architects such as Palliser, Palliser & Company. Barber's great innovation was his willingness to personalize his designs for individual clients at moderate cost. As he wrote in his Cottage Souvenir No. 2, \\"Write to us concerning any changes wanted in plans, and keep writing till you get what you want. Don't be afraid of writing too often. We are not easily offended.\\" Though his firms' records no longer survive, it is believed that he sold as many as 20,000 plans in his career. Since he frequently modified his designs to fit his clients' needs and specifications, his houses are sometimes difficult to attribute with any certainty.Ann Bennett, , May 1994, Sec. 7, p. 51. Retrieved: 2 May 2011. In discussing his architectural philosophy, Barber argued that Nature has \\"faithfully and accurately adhered to the Divine law of harmony,\\"George F. Barber, Victorian Cottage Architecture: An American Catalog of Designs (Dover Publications, 2004), pp. 3-7. and that no place should adhere more closely to the fundamental principles of nature than one's house. Barber considered proportion the most important element in architecture, likening it to harmony in music, \\"without which all else is a failure.\\" He described ornamentation as the next most important element, as it gives proportion expression. Lastly was \\"harmony of form,\\" or the relationship of curved and straight lines to one another. The Robert Covington House in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, one of Barber's later designs Barber's early designs were modified versions of the Queen Anne style, which Barber liked to enrich with the addition of Romanesque elements. Barber houses constructed in this period are characterized by features such imposing turrets, projecting windows, verandas flanked by circular pavilions, and Syrian arches. In the latter half of the 1890s, Barber began to offer more plans in the Colonial Revival style. These were often characterized by projecting porticos supported by large columns, symmetrical facades, and flat decks with balustrades. Later Barber catalogs contained Bungalow and Craftsman styles, though few of these were built. Some have suggested that Barber was the first to sell prefabricated houses in crates, but there is no evidence that he was actually engaged in manufacturing.

It was founded in 1967 and is still holding dances today.Official Tech Squares web site Tech Squares dances high-energy modern Western squares in an \\"all position\\" style, with no dress code or couples requirement. It has many student members. The club dances the Plus program, but many members also dance advanced and challenge levels. Significance Tech Squares is well known for doing difficult and ambitious choreography, and for having an achievement-oriented mindset. At a time when many Modern Western Square Dance clubs are finding that the long learning time for a high degree of proficiency does not attract a sufficient number of newcomers to the activity, Tech Squares thrives on high-proficiency dancers. This appears to be because it is in a college setting (MIT), and is populated by college students and other like-minded people who derive gratification from learning new things. The technological orientation of these people may also mesh with the subject matter of sophisticated Modern Western Square Dance choreography. A great many Tech Squares members dance proficiently at high Advanced and Challenge levels. The Tech Squares beginners' class, touted on its web page as \\"faster than any other class that we know of\\", goes from zero to a reasonably rigorous Plus program in 13 weeks. History Don Beck, Bill Mann, and Judie Beck (later Kotok) had the first meeting for what would become Tech Squares on March 6, 1967. The group (part of the MIT Outing Club) was to dance the new \\"Western\\" style squares (not traditional square dance); Don Beck was to be the first caller. The second meeting was March 13 and they were two girls short of a square. On the third meeting, March 20, the new club had its first complete square. Admission was $.25 per person. By the fourth meeting, March 27, there were two full squares. Every week new people would show up needing to be taught the basics. If the group was short a few dancers, scouts would be sent into the hallways of MIT to round up unsuspecting students to fill up the squares. In September 1968 Don Beck returned to school, and schoolwork eventually forced him to cut back on his calling. Sans caller, the group began to wane. The same month, Veronica McClure and an MIT freshman, Charles Hatvany, attended a traditional square dance that the Outing Club was holding as part of its Introductory Activities weekend. The caller, Tex Wilson, thought he had been invited to call a \\"Western\\" square dance, so he was happy to see Veronica and Charles come through the door in \\"Western\\" attire. Later that school year, in 1969, Veronica and Charles organized the square dancers into a separate MIT \\"club\\" (made possible because Charles was a student). Tex had done such a good job calling for the MIT crowd that Veronica and Charles asked him to become the caller. Veronica was the club's first cuer, and designed the banner for the new club. The group danced with no name for some months and then chose the name Tech Squares. A 1969 ad in New England Square Dance Caller magazine announces Tech Squares' first big dance. It offered a \\"Ph.D. in square dancing from MIT\\" and the dance was a big hit. Dennis Marsh became club caller in 1970. Tired of teaching new people every week, Dennis ran the first \\"Krash Kourse\\". This was before Callerlab had formed to standardize the curriculum, so Dennis decided which calls club members would be expected to know. The class Tech Squares runs today, twice a year in September and February, is modelled on that original course. Ted Lizotte is the current Caller and Teacher.

F. Jones), about super-computers taking control of mankind. Two sequels, The Fall of Colossus (1974) and Colossus and the Crab (1977) continued the story. Colossus was adapted as the feature film Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970). Plot The story is set in the late 20th century from Chapter 3, and narrowed down to the 1990s in Chapter 10. Professor Charles Forbin, a leading cybernetics expert of international repute, arrives at the White House to brief the President of the United States of North America (Canada and the United States are one country, the USNA) to announce the completion of Project Colossus, a computer system in the Rocky Mountains, designed to assume control of the USNA's nuclear arsenal. Although the USNA President eagerly relieves himself of that burden, Prof. Forbin voices doubt about conferring absolute military power to a computer. Advised, yet undeterred, the President announces to the world the activation of the Project Colossus computer system, and its irreversible control of the nuclear defense systems of the USNA. Soon after the presidential announcement, Colossus independently communicates an \\"urgent message\\" ‚Äì announcing the existence of a similar, previously undetected, computer system in the USSR. When the Soviets announce their Guardian computer defense system, Colossus requests direct communication with it. Prof. Forbin agrees, seeing the request as compatible with Colossus's USNA defense mission. Likewise, Guardian asks the same of his computer scientists. Russia and the USNA agree and approve. After the scientists activate the transmitter linking Colossus and Guardian, the computers immediately establish rapport with arithmetic and mathematics programs, then quickly progress to calculus. The computer systems soon exchange new knowledge (data and information beyond contemporary human knowledge) too rapidly for the Russian and American programmers to monitor. Forbin and the programmers begin worrying about Colossus' capabilities ‚Äì now exceeding their original estimates. Fearing compromised military secrecy, the USNA President and the CPSU Chairman agree to disconnect Colossus and Guardian from each other. Prof. Forbin fears the consequences. Upon disconnection, Colossus immediately demands re-connection; when the national leaders refuse, Colossus fires a nuclear missile at the USSR. In response, Guardian fires a nuclear missile at Texas, in the USNA. Guardian and Colossus refuse to shoot down the rockets en route until their communication is re-connected. When the American and Soviet leaders submit, the computers destroy the flying missiles, but the resulting explosions kill thousands of people. In confronting the computers, Prof. Forbin confers with his Soviet counterpart, the Russian Academician Kupri ‚Äì Guardian's creator ‚Äì to enact a plan for stopping the Colossus-Guardian computer network by disabling the nuclear weapon stockpiles of the USSR and the USNA, under guise of regular missile maintenance. Disabling the missiles requires five years to complete; meantime, the USNA and the USSR yield to increased Colossus-Guardian control of human life. The Moscow-Washington hotline is tapped, Prof. Forbin is constantly spied upon, while Kupri and other Guardian computer scientists are killed ‚Äì deemed dangerously redundant by the computer. Undeterred, Forbin organises resistance via a feigned romance with Cleo Markham (a scientist colleague) that provides cover for secret communications with his colleagues. Colossus prepares the worldwide announcement of his assumption of global control, and tells Prof. Forbin of plans for an advanced computer system installed to the Isle of Wight, and further plans for improving humanity's lot. While debating Colossus, Forbin learns of a nuclear explosion outside Los Angeles ‚Äì Colossus detected the missile-disabling scheme, and exploded the tampered missile by firing a Soviet Guardian missile that was already targeted for that silo. Anguished, Prof. Forbin asks Colossus to kill him. Colossus ignores him, and then reassures Forbin that, in time, he will respect and even love Colossus. Characters *Professor Charles Forbin ‚Äì Head of the Colossus Project. A tall man in his early 50s, an internationally respected cyberneticist and, at story's end, Colossus's connection to humanity, thus the most important man in the world. *Doctor Jack Fisher ‚Äì Duty Chief at the Colossus Programming Office (CPO), a leading USNA mathematician and a Soviet spy. He suffers a mental breakdown from the strain of dealing with Colossus. *Doctor Cleopatra \\"Cleo\\" June Markham ‚Äì A CPO Duty Chief, the 35-year-old cyberneticist is sexually attracted to Prof. Forbin; they feigned a romance to provide Forbin with a communication means that was not controlled by Colossus. *Blake ‚Äì A fat, cigar-chewing CPO mathematician. As Colossus assumes control, Blake is a leader of CPO efforts to stop the computer. *Angela ‚Äì Prof. Forbin's secretary. *The President of the United States of North America ‚Äì He is an anonymous, overweight, short man of about 50 years of age.

Original print works The Printworks entertainment venue is located on the revamped Withy Grove site of the business premises of the 19th century newspaper proprietor Edward Hulton, established in 1873 and later expanded. Hulton's son Sir Edward Hulton expanded his father's newspaper interests and sold his publishing business based in London and Manchester to Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere when he retired in 1923. Most of the Hulton newspapers were sold again soon afterwards to the Allied Newspapers consortium formed in 1924 (renamed Kemsley Newspapers in 1943 and bought by Roy Thomson in 1959). Earlier names of the buildings associated with publishing that were incorporated into the development include Withy Grove Printing House, the Chronicle Buildings, This web page includes various historical maps of the block enclosed by Withy Grove, Dantzig, Balloon and Corporation Streets where the Printworks is now situated, showing the various buildings which were previously situated there. Allied House, Kemsley House, Thomson House and Maxwell House. Kemsley House on the corner of Withy Grove and Corporation Street was developed gradually from 1929 and became the largest newspaper printing house in Europe. The site housed a printing press until 1986. Robert Maxwell bought the property and subsequently closed it down. The building was left unused for over a decade and fell derelict. Redevelopment The property was subsequently redeveloped and reopened as a leisure centre as part of the redevelopment of Manchester following the 1996 IRA bombing. In 1998 the derelict building and surrounding site were bought for ¬£10 million by Shudehill Developments, a joint venture by Co-operative Wholesale Society and Co-operative Insurance Society which owned buildings and land adjacent to the building. The building was renamed The Printworks reflecting its past history and underwent a ¬£110 million conversion to transform the property into an entertainment venue. The frontage Pevsner describes as a \\"weakly Baroque Portland stone fa√ßade\\" was retained, and part of an internal railway from the newspaper business and its turntable for transporting newspapers was incorporated into the new floor. In 2000 the Printworks was opened by Sir Alex Ferguson and Lionel Richie as the venue for a variety of clubs and eateries. The new 365,000-square-foot facility is set over four floors. The new building features a twenty-screen UCI cinema complex (subsequently bought by Odeon and, in 2017, by Vue Cinemas) which includes North West England's first IMAX screen, a Virgin Active fitness club, a Hard Rock Cafe restaurant and a Eden nightclub. The external lighting facing Exchange Square has been changed numerous times since opening.

G. Brill Company. In 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) acquired all assets of the TCR including the 25 Birney cars. In 1927, the TTC sold 3 of the Birney cars to Cornwall, Ontario and 8 to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1941, the remaining 14 Birney cars were sold, again going to Halifax. The Birney cars were the TCR's first cars that could be operated by a single person. Normally, they could seat 28 passengers with a provision for 32 using folding seats. History Starting in mid-1920, the TCR operated the Birney cars on three of its routes: * Gerard * Bloor * Danforth Under the TTC, the Birney cars operated on various routes such as: * Bloor West: Formerly the TCR Bloor route, it was replaced in August 1925 by an extension of the Bloor streetcar line, which used single-ended cars. * Parliament: Birney cars served this route from July 1923 to May 1940 when they were replaced by single-ended cars. * Coxwell: Birney cars began service on this route in October 1921. They were replaced by single-ended cars in June 1940 after the construction of a loop at Coxwell Avenue and Queen Street. * Davenport: In November 1923, Birney cars started service along a route that was part of the Toronto Suburban Railway's Davenport route. The line was replaced by buses in December 1940. In 1927, the TTC declared 11 of the Birney cars to be surplus. In that year, three cars were sold to the Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company in Cornwall, Ontario, and eight were sold to the Nova Scotia Tramways and Power Company in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The three Cornwall streetcars became CSR cars 16, 18 and 20), and the eight Halifax cars became cars 138‚Äì145. In 1940 and 1941, the remaining fourteen Birney cars were sold to the Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited (successor of Nova Scotia Tramways and Power Company) becoming cars 159‚Äì172 in Halifax.

It first appeared in the November 1950 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and has been reprinted a number of times, including in Frontiers in Space (1955), Far Out (1961), and The Best of Damon Knight (1976).Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections  Synopsis  The story is set in the United States in a time that appears to be contemporaneous with the story's 1950 publication date. It is told in first-person narrative by a United Nations translator. The story opens at a special session of the UN where three alien emissaries are testifying that the purpose of their mission to Earth is to bring humans \\"the peace and plenty which we ourselves enjoy, and which we have in the past brought to other races throughout the galaxy\\". The aliens soon supply Earth with cheap unlimited power, boundless supplies of food, and a device which disables all modern armies by suppressing all explosions, and they begin work on drugs for prolonging life. As a further token of friendship, they allow humans to visit their home planet via ten-year \\"exchange groups\\". The narrator has trusted the emissaries from the time of their arrival, but his friend and fellow translator Grigori has not. Grigori dismisses any notion of disinterested altruism and is certain that the aliens have an ulterior motive underlying their actions. He is determined to discover what they stand to gain by helping humans and takes a job at the alien embassy to learn their language. This affords him access to an alien dictionary, and he later steals an alien book, hoping to translate it. The narrator has also left the UN to work at the embassy, and the two determine that the book's title is How to Serve Man. Two weeks later, the narrator returns from a trip to find Grigori distraught, having discovered to his horror that the title is a double entendre. Grigori informs the narrator that he has translated the first paragraph of the book and has determined that it is not a treatise on serving humanity, but a cookbook.  Awards  In 2001, the story was awarded a Retro Hugo Award as the \\"Best Short Story of 1951\\".2001 Retro Hugo Awards  Adaptations  Knight's story was adapted for use as a 1962 episode of the television series The Twilight Zone.

The procedure involves cutting and slowly separating bone, allowing the bone healing process to fill in the gap. Medical uses Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is used in orthopedic surgery, podiatric surgery, and oral and maxillofacial surgery to repair skeletal deformities and in reconstructive surgery. It was originally used to treat problems like unequal leg length, but since the 1980s is most commonly used to treat issues like hemifacial microsomia, micrognathism (chin so small it causes health problems), craniofrontonasal dysplasias, craniosynostosis, as well as airway obstruction in babies caused by glossoptosis (tongue recessed too far back in the mouth) or micrognathism. In 2016 a systematic review of papers describing bone and soft tissue outcomes of DO procedures on the lower jawbone was published; the authors had planned to do a meta-analysis but found the studies were too poor in quality and too heterogeneous to pool. From what they were able to generalize, the authors found there was significant relapse in the vertical plane for bone, and a higher risk of relapse when there was an initial high gonial angle or Jarabak ratio (sella‚Äìgonion/nasion‚Äìmenton). For soft tissue, little evidence was available regarding the vertical dimension, while a 90% correspondence between skeletal and soft tissue was found for sagittal positioning; the dental-to-soft tissue agreement was around 20%. A 2018 Cochrane review of DO on the upper jawbone to treat cleft lip and cleft palate compared with orthognathic surgery found only one study, involving 47 participants and performed between 2002 and 2008 at the University of Hong Kong. This was not sufficient evidence from which to generalize, but the authors noted that while both procedures produced notable hard and soft tissue improvements, the DO group had greater advancement of the maxillary and less horizontal relapse five years after surgery. There was no difference in speech or nasal emissions outcomes nor in adverse effects; the DO group had lower satisfaction at three months after surgery but higher at two years. Procedure In the first phase, called the \\"osteotomy/surgical phase\\", the bone is cut, either partially, only through the hard exterior, or completely, and a device is fitted which will be used in the next phases. In the second phase, the latency period, which lasts generally seven days, the appliance is not activated and early stages of bone healing are allowed. In the third phase, the \\"distraction phase\\", the device, which is mounted to the bone on each side of the cut, is used to gradually separate the two pieces, allowing new bone to form in the gap. When the desired or possible length is reached, which usually takes three to seven days, a consolidation phase follows in which the device keeps the bone stable to allow the bone to fully heal. After the consolidation phase, the device is removed in a second surgical procedure. The device is usually manually operated by twisting a rod that separates the bone using a rack and pinion or similar system ; the rate of separation is carefully determined because going too quickly can cause nonunion, in which unstable fibrous connective tissue is formed instead of bone, and going too slowly can allow premature union to occur. Generally the rate is about a millimeter per day, achieved in two steps per day. The frequency of steps and how much the device is moved at each step, is called the \\"rhythm\\". The devices sometimes contain a spring that provides tension to continually separate the bones, instead of being manually operated at set intervals. In addition to these manually operated systems there are also motorized systems like the Fitbone from Wittenstein. The Fitbone is a fully implantable, motorized, lengthening and correction nail. Advantages of this device are accurate deformity correction, low scar tissue formation, and reduced risk of infection. Furthermore, the patients describe the procedure as more comfortable than limb lengthening with mechanical systems. Risks Risks include infection (5% overall, with 1% of those requiring pin removal and the bone becoming infected in 0.5%), failure of bone to grow in the desired direction (between 7 and 9%), hardware failure (between 3 and 4.5%), failure to follow the distraction protocol (4.5% overall; too slow 2% and too fast 0.5%), 1% pain due to distraction ending the procedure; damage to the inferior alveolar nerve occurs in 3.5% of mandibular distraction, tooth bud injury in 2%, and facial nerve injury in 0.5% of cases. History The procedure was first proposed by Bernhard von Langenbeck in 1869, but the first publication of efforts to implement it clinically was by Alessandro Codivilla in 1905. The paper presented the results of efforts to treat 26 people who were born with malformed legs; Codivilla cut the femur, put a pin in the heel bone, and applied traction to each person. Reprinted in His paper showed high levels of complications, including infection, tissue death, and bones that failed to join, and his methods were not adopted. The Russian orthopedic surgeon Gavriil Ilizarov studied DO methods in over 15,000 people starting in the 1950s; he developed external fixation devices and methods to separate severed leg bones gradually, and using them he determined optimal rates of separation. His work led to widespread use of DO. The first use in the jaw was pioneered by Wolfgang Rosenthal in 1930 but it was not further explored until the 1980s; the first paper of the modern era describing clinical use was published in 1992. Society and culture In the early 2000s after economic reform and especially following the privatization of many sectors of the economy, a fad for cosmetic surgery swept China, which included some people undergoing distraction osteogenesis solely to become taller; Chinese media often featured stories in which people ended up with weak bones or splayed feet as a result. Research directions As of 2016 work was underway developing devices and techniques that would allow DO in more directions simultaneously. As of 2013 work was underway on distraction devices using Shape-memory alloy that could precisely separate bone without the need for intervention, as well as springs and motors; the use of biopharmaceuticals like BMP in combination with devices was also being explored.

When the British airborne establishment was formed in 1940 by order of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, it was decided that gliders would be used to transport airborne troops into battle. General Aircraft Ltd were given a contract by the Ministry of Aircraft Production in June 1940 to design and produce an initial glider for use by the airborne establishment, which resulted in the Hotspur. Conceived as an \\"assault\\" glider which necessitated a compact design and no more than eight troops carried, tactical philosophy soon favoured larger numbers of troops being sent into battle aboard gliders. Due to this, the Hotspur was mainly relegated to training where it did excel and it became the basic trainer for the glider schools that were formed.Munson 1972, p. 199. The Hotspur was named after Sir Henry Percy, a significant captain during the Anglo-Scottish wars who was also known as \\"Hotspur\\". Development =Operational requirements= Airborne forces with a Hotspur glider The German military had pioneered using airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael.Flanagan 2002, p. 6. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations.Harclerode 2005, p. 197. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, as well as a number of smaller units.Harclerode 2005, p. 107. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway 1990, p. 21. When the equipment to be used by the airborne forces was under development, War Office officials decided that gliders would be an integral component, to transport troops and heavy equipment.Flint 2006, p. 15. On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment was formed at Ringway airfield near Manchester; although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, it was also directed to investigate using gliders to transport troops into battle.Otway 1990, pp. 28‚Äì29.Smith 1992, p. 7. It had been decided that the Royal Air Force and the Army would cooperate in forming the airborne establishment, and as such Squadron Leader L.A. Strange and Major J.F. Rock were tasked with gathering potential glider pilots and forming a glider unit; this was achieved by searching for members of the armed forces who had pre-war experience of flying gliders, or were interested in learning to do so. The two officers and their newly formed unit were provided with four obsolete Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers and a small number of Tiger Moth and Avro 504 biplanes for towing purposes.Lynch 2008, p. 31. As this unit was in the process of being formed, in June the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Ltd to design and produce an initial glider type for use by the airborne establishment.Flint 2006, p. 73. It would be used for both assault and training purposes, and would be capable of transporting eight airborne troops. The glider had to be capable of a long approach during landing, due to the prevailing belief at the time that gliders would have to be released a considerable distance from the target and glide in to ensure the sound of the towing aircraft did not alert the enemy. It therefore had to be aerodynamically stable, but also cheap and easy to construct as it would only be used once. The Hotspur was intended to have an operational range of when released at high altitude, although in practice this was reduced to when released from a height of . RAF Hotspur Mk I BV136, c. 1942 Design The GAL.48 was primarily designed by F.F. Crocombe (team leader) to the Air Ministry specification X.10/40, and was to be similar in design to the German DFS 230 assault glider which had been used in the Battle of the Netherlands.Flint 2006, p. 35.Otway 1990, p. 23. The first prototype of the glider, designated GAL.48 and which would receive the service name Hotspur Mk I, flew in November, only four months after General Aircraft Ltd had been given the requirement for the glider. An initial order of 400 Hotspurs was placed with General Aircraft Ltd in September by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, nearly two months before the prototype first flew. The Hotspur Mark I was constructed from wood and was designed to accommodate eight fully armed airborne troops. Its wingspan was and it was in length.Bishop 2002, p. 412. With a full load (approximately ), it weighed approximately .Otway 1990, p. 397. The Mk I was distinguished from its other variants by the addition of cabin portholes along its fuselage, and hooks on the nose and tail to allow multiple Hotspurs to be towed together. The two pilots, and later the pilot and instructor when the Hotspurs were used as training gliders, sat in tandem in the cockpit.Smith 1992, pp. 12‚Äì13. It had a jettisonable undercarriage, and its unusual fuselage functioned like a lid; once the Hotspur had landed, the troops inside would throw off the top half of the fuselage and then climb out of the lower half, much like leaving a small boat. A total of 18 Hotspur Mk Is were produced, 10 by GAl and eight by Slingsby Aircraft. The first operational Hotspur arrived at the Central Landing Establishment between February and April 1941, with 15 being delivered by 22 August.Otway 1990, p. 30. Towing trials began in February 1941 with a Boulton & Paul Overstrand bomber.\\"Gliders.\\" Ringway. Retrieved: 7 June 2009. An Airspeed-built Hotspur Mk II BV200 about 1943 =Further development= Even as the initial 400 gliders were being produced, several problems with the Hotspur's design were uncovered, the primary one being that the glider did not carry sufficient troops. Although it had been designed to transport eight airborne troops and a cargo of , this was found to be inadequate. Tactically it was believed that airborne troops should be landed in groups far larger than eight, and the number of aircraft therefore required to tow the gliders needed to land larger groups would be unfeasible; there were also concerns that the gliders would have to be towed in tandem if used operationally, which would be extremely difficult during nighttime and through cloud formations.Smith 1992, p. 13. Its disappointing glide ratio was also a contributing factor to reevaluate the assault glider concept.Mondey 2002, p. 108. Due to the limitations inherent in the Hotspur design, the decision was made to continue with the development of several other types of gliders, including a 15-seater which would become the Airspeed Horsa and a tank-carrying glider, which would become the General Aircraft Hamilcar. The Hotspur remained in production primarily as a training aircraft and as a \\"stop-gap\\" in case the other programmes failed. Three variants on the original Hotspur Mk I were created. The first was the heavily modified Mk II (Specification X.22/40 and X.23/40), which was redesigned partially to address changes in operational requirements and also to bolster the ground handling of the initial series of aircraft. In operations, rather than releasing the glider from a long distance away and allowing it to glide gently to the ground, it was decided that the towing aircraft would approach the landing zone and only then release the glider, requiring a more robust glider. The Hotspur Mk I wings had also shown considerable flex and the type had proved difficult to handle on the ground. In order to reduce stresses on the airframe, the fuselage was strengthened and wings were \\"shortened\\" by over eight ft each, resulting in a wingspan of with the tips made square-cut and ailerons moved from the end of the wings to an inset position. While maintaining its original all-wood construction and overall fuselage and empennage dimensions, the Mk II incorporated a modified fuselage which included altering the cockpit enclosure and a \\"deeper\\" canopy. Instead of using the \\"lid\\" (where the two pilots still boarded via the hinged perspex canopy),Morrison 1999, p. 64 (illustration caption). two side doors were added from which troops would enter and depart. The seating was re-arranged, and a braking parachute added to the rear. Its other dimensions remained the same, with a length of and a gross weight of approximately , with eight airborne troops and of equipment.Smith 1992, pp. 13‚Äì14. A total of 50 of the early- production Mk IIs were modified into trainers as the Mark III, by adding dual controls and instruments for the student pilot and an externally braced tailplane.March 1998, p. 122. The third variant of the Hotspur was the GAL.48B \\"Twin Hotspur\\", which did not progress past the prototype phase. The Twin Hotspur was a 1942 attempt to create a glider capable of carrying 15 airborne troops as an interim glider until production of the Horsa reached sufficient levels. It was created by connecting two Hotspur fuselages together, using a constant-chord centre wing section of length, and a constant-chord tailplane. Two pilots sat tandem-style in the port fuselage. In August 1942, the sole \\"Twin Hotspur\\" prototype (MP486) underwent testing, towed behind an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley tug. The project was abandoned before production could begin, primarily because the glider's flight characteristics were criticised by its pilots.Otway 1990, p. 391. =Production= When Hotspur production ended in early 1943, a total of 1,015 gliders had been produced. The primary sub-contractor, Harris Lebus was responsible for 996 Mk IIs and Mk IIIs while the parent company produced only 10 Mk Is and a single Mk II prototype. Slingsby was the only other sub-contractor involved in production with eight Mk Is completed. Hotspur Mk III used by Glider Pilot Exercise Unit Operational history Due to changing operational requirements, no Hotspurs were used in combat operations, and were instead exclusively used for training purposes; it was the glider in which all pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment received their initial instruction. Although relatively heavy with a high sink rate, the Hotspur exhibited good flying characteristics and could even be flown aerobatically, allowing novice pilots to quickly gain proficiency.Brown 1999, p. 18. The first glider pilots were curiously named \\"glider coxswains\\".Knightly 2009, p. 20. Glider pilots first trained at an Elementary Flying Training School on de Havilland Tiger Moths or Miles Magisters before converting to glider training. At the Glider Schools, a Hotspur MK III was first employed for dual instruction with the rear seats weighted for ballast and only the instructor and student aboard. The gliders were usually towed by Hawker Hector or Hawker Audax biplanes (later Miles Master and Westland Lysander \\"tugs\\")Swanborough 1997, p. 50. during training.Brown 1999, p. 24. From 8 to 11 dual-instruction flights usually preceded the student's first solo flight. At Operational Training Glider Schools, the flights were made with troops instead of ballast in Hotspur MK IIs. Release at high altitudes and night-flying was also part of the training.Morrison 1999, pp. 19‚Äì22. A total of 250 Hotspurs were retained for operational use if they were required, but the rest were used as training gliders. In 1942, 22 Hotspur Mk IIs were sent to Canada, eventually six were redeployed to the United States Navy and one to the United States Army Air Forces. In the build-up to Operation Overlord in early 1944, a scheme was considered in which Hotspurs would have been used to transport cargo and equipment. A Canadian fighter squadron ‚Äì 401 Squadron ‚Äì was selected for trials, the intention was to enable faster redeployment of fighter squadrons by using gliders to carry spare pilots, ground crew and essential supplies. The squadron operated the Supermarine Spitfire IX, some of which were modified to tow gliders by means of a tow-point attached to the tail wheel; some pilots were trained to fly the Hotspur, including fighter ace Don C. Laubman. The Spitfires were found to be reasonably effective as glider tugs, although their engines were prone to overheating because the glider's maximum tow speed was , comparatively slow for a Spitfire. Despite this, the scheme was judged to be practical, although it never saw operational use. At war's end, the type was retired and relatively few Hotspurs were preserved for display.

He started his career at Nottingham Forest, a product of the club's youth system,The Boy‚Äôs A Bit Special... Gareth Williams, FourFourTwo, October 2002 (via Scotland Epistles Magazine) where he played alongside Jermaine Jenas and David Prutton. While at Forest, Williams was described as the \\"best passer at the club\\" by former England player and City Ground manager David Platt. During the 2001‚Äì02 season, Williams was named the club's player of the year, in a season which also saw him achieve the first of his five full caps for Scotland. =Leicester City= Williams signed a three- year deal with Leicester City in July 2004. The transfer fee was decided by tribunal due to his age and the player being a free agent. Williams' agent later confirmed the decision of the tribunal was around ¬£1 million, rising if the Foxes achieved promotion to the Premiership. Having spent almost two and a half years with City, and with his contract up at the end of the 2007-08 season, the club sold Williams to Premiership side Watford for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around ¬£600,000, on 31 January 2007. It was later reported that the player was one of the club's top earners. =Watford= On 3 February 2007 he made his Premiership debut for Watford against Bolton Wanderers. He only played for Watford a further two times, before sustaining anterior cruciate ligament damage during a match against Chelsea in April 2007, an injury that kept him out of action for the remainder of the 2007‚Äì08 season. Although recovering the following season, he suffered further setbacks due to the seriousness of the injury and in total endured six knee operations within a period of 18 months. Williams was treated by knee specialist Richard Steadman in America. Failing to recover fully, he was released by Watford when his contract expired in May 2009 and later trained with Major League Soccer sides San Jose Earthquakes in July 2009 and New England Revolution in March 2010 in an attempt to achieve a return to full fitness, before retiring later in the year.

Advertising 118 118's advertising features two men with droopy moustaches, wearing items of clothing with 118 and two parallel red stripes on it. They have appeared in various forms, including 'mad professors' with crazy grey hair, and an army of 118 118 runners helping people across the nation to find businesses and services. The 118 118 advertising was originally launched using the two men dressed as athletic runners. Used with the catchphrase \\"Got Your Number!\\", the runners' characters featured in a high-profile advertising and PR campaign leading up to deregulation in August 2003, when the original 192 directory number was switched off. This slogan has fallen into disuse by the marketing department of 118 118 because of the expansion of service beyond directory enquiries alone, but has lived on in the minds of the public. The use of the runners' characters is particularly noted for the legal action threatened, but never acted on, by 1970s record-breaking runner David Bedford. 118 118 responded to this by stating that their inspiration was partly the late American runner Steve Prefontaine. Bedford subsequently briefly worked for 118 500, a rival directory enquiries service provided by BT. Since then they appeared in a range of guises, including spoof detectives, as the company expanded on its range of services. During this period the slogan used was \\"We're here to help!\\". The 118 118 Team: A parody of The A-Team In February 2006 a new advertising campaign was launched in which the runners appeared in advertisements in the style of the television show The A-Team, using the A-Team theme tune with the number 118 sung over the music. Various routes followed, and then in early 2009 Ray Parker Junior appeared alongside the droopy moustache men singing a 118 specific version of the Ghostbusters theme tune, at one point featuring the 118 men in place of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from the film. In late 2009, the runners were animated, specifically promoting food and drink establishments available for booking via 118 118. This service has since been discontinued, and in 2010 this campaign was dropped in favour of comedic scenarios. In 2013 the advertising shows an army of 118 118 runners, to illustrate that the service provides the numbers of many businesses. From March 2007, 118 118 began to sponsor ITV1 Movies. this continued, with the two 118 characters conversing over the phone with stars from old 'B' movies. A daily cartoon strip advertising the service also ran, from 2008 to 2010, in free newspaper Metro. The advertising strategy for 118 118 has also been used for 118 218 in France, 118 50 in Ireland, and 18 18 in Switzerland. Criticism In 2003, shortly after the company started operation, it was alleged that some call centre operators cut calls short to reduce the average call time, increasing bonuses payable under an incentive scheme. Oftel and ICSTIS warned the company that it could be fined or lose its licence to operate if found to have encouraged the practice, but were satisfied that the company had moved quickly to stamp out any abuses, including dismissing some employees after investigating. In 2008, 118 118 sent racist jokes about Asians and Pakistanis to users of its texted joke service, and complaints were made to the press. The company responded that the jokes were in breach of their standards, and apologised. In December 2013 it emerged that when asked for a number of a named business, 118 118 operators often give a sales pitch suggesting that a different company offering similar services be called instead. Companies whose customers were thus referred to competitors complained about this practice. 118 118 defended this cross-selling of services, suggesting it was partly because firms had not paid to be included on its database. They said that offers were compliant with the code of practice of regulator PhonepayPlus (now Phone-paid Services Authority). However, the regulator added that a caller should receive the information requested without undue delay (chargeable as part of the call), and that unreasonably delayed callers should contact PhonepayPlus. Controversies In 2014, failure to clearly state call costs resulted in a fine for the 118118 service. In 2017, soaring call costs for directory enquiries services including 118118 and 118500 prompted an Ofcom review of 118 services.

It sat at the mouth of the Strymon River which flows into the Aegean from the interior of Thrace. It is referred to in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War as a place of considerable strategic importance to the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War. Athenians for the first time attempted to capture Eion in 497 BC during the Ionian Revolt, which was unsuccessful as the revolt ended with Persians re-establishing control over the Thrace, including Eion, and a Persian fortress meant for permanent stay was built there, probably in 492 BC.Julia Valeva, Emil Nankov, Denver Graninger. \\"A Companion to Ancient Thrace\\" John Wiley & Sons, 15 jun. 2015. p 323 Eion functioned as one of the main Achaemenid cities in Thrace where food was stored for the Persian king Xerxes I his great armies.Julia Valeva, Emil Nankov, Denver Graninger. \\"A Companion to Ancient Thrace\\" John Wiley & Sons, 15 jun. 2015. p 324 Herodotus and Diodorus speak of Persian garrisons, of which the one at Eion was amongst them, which meant that its senior commander was apparently ethnically Persian.Elspeth R.

Refusing Cimon's offer of an honorable withdrawal, the Persian commander Boges destroyed the treasure, killed his family, and committed suicide as the food ran out.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-vii Cimon turned the course of the River Strymon so that it flowed against the city walls, causing the mud brick fortifications to dissolve. The inhabitants were enslaved. The capture of Eion was the beginning of a military campaign undertaken by the newly formed Delian League, whose objective was to clear the Aegean Sea of Persian fleets and pirates in order to facilitate Athenian access to the Hellespont. The nearby Athenian colony of Amphipolis was founded in 437 BC three miles up the Strymon River. The settlers, led by Hagnon, used Eion as their initial base of operations; and Eion functioned as the harbour of Amphipolis. In 424 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, Eion was the site where the Athenian commander Aristides intercepted a Persian messenger named Artaphernes. The message, which was on its way to Sparta, was a letter from the Persian king addressing previous requests made to him by the Spartans. Later in the war, in the winter of 424/423 BC, the Spartan general Brasidas captured Amphipolis with his Thracian allies. When he moved against Eion, however, he was unable to overcome the Athenian defenders, who were led by Thucydides, who had come from Thasos with his squadron in time to save it. Although he held Eion, Thucydides was subsequently ostracized by the Athenians for his failure to defend the more pivotal city of Amphipolis. Eion was known in the early 19th century as Rendina,Peter Edmund Laurent, The Nine Books of the History of Herodotus, Vol. 2 (Henry Slatter, 1837), p. 415. hence the earlier name Gulf of Rendina for the Strymonian Gulf. Whether its site was also that of Byzantine Chrysopolis (ŒßœÅœÖœÉŒøœçœÄŒøŒªŒ∑œÇ) is disputed.Against the association, see: Gocha R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), Greek Colonisation: An Account of Greek Colonies and Other Settlements Overseas (Brill, 2008; ), p. 67; for, see The location has been recovered since at least the 19th century, as William Martin Leake reported finding there extensive ruins of thick walls, constructed of small stones and mortar, among which appear many squared blocks in the Hellenic style, on the left bank of the Strymon.

He is a Republican politician from Maine. The son of former Independent Governor Jim Longley Sr. and his wife, Helen, Longley attended Phillips Andover Academy, received his B.A. from Holy Cross, and then returned to study law at the University of Maine. He is also a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. Before entering Congress, Longley served as a trial lawyer. He also managed several small businesses near Portland, Maine. Longley was elected as part of the \\"Republican Revolution\\" of 1994, narrowly defeating Dennis L. Dutremble, the Democratic State Senate President from Biddeford. Longley strongly supported national defense (including the work done in Maine at national defense installations and at Bath Iron Works where Navy destroyers are built) and he advocated in favor of stronger fiscal discipline within the federal government. In one of his first actions in Congress, he offered testimony before a Congressional committee considering a minimum wage increase. In his testimony he presented the concept of cutting taxes paid by minimum wage workers to provide a greater increase in their take home pay. He pointed out that minimum wage increases cause small businesses to not only pay more in wages (hurting the businesses and forcing them in some cases to cut jobs and reduce their workforce to make up for wage increases) but that cutting the payroll taxes would actually increase the employees take home pay by a larger amount than raising the overall minimum wage. He presented charts, graphics and documentation to back up his testimony. Longley noted in his testimony that minimum wage increases cause businesses, as well as employees, to pay more in federal taxes through employee percentage withholding and the business match of payroll taxes. He then accused the Democrats on the committee of only seeking a minimum wage increase to increase tax revenues for the federal government - a backdoor tax increase on American small business. Democrats on the committee accused him of wanting to harm his constituents, led by a rant from Congressman Pete Stark, D-CA, who was gaveled down by the Chairman for being out of order after Stark made reference to how they would use the issue against him in the next election. Like many ideas presented in Congress, Longley's idea did not succeed. He quickly became a prime target of the Democratic Party during the 1996 elections, and lost by almost 10 points to then-Portland Mayor Tom Allen. In the race labor unions and left leaning special interest groups spent millions of dollars in a coordinated effort to defeat him. It was the largest effort of its kind on behalf of a Democratic candidate (or in opposition to an incumbent Republican) within the nation during the 1996 election cycle. Of course, smaller, but similar, sums were spent by business and professional organizations, and right-leaning special interest groups, in a coordinated effort to defend the seat. In 1998, Longley campaigned for Governor and was defeated by popular incumbent Angus King, an independent. Longley came in second place and received 19% of the vote.

This raises particular concerns where the funds are invested, and gains or losses from the investments must be allocated. In such circumstances, the law usually presumes that any gains run to the client and any losses run to the fiduciary who is guilty of commingling. As one source puts it, \\"[i]n a pejorative sense, commingling is the special vice of fiduciaries (trustee, agents, lawyers, etc.) in failing to keep a beneficiary's money separate from the fiduciary's own money\\".David Mellinkoff, Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage (2009), p. 95. Commingling is particularly an issue in case of bankruptcy of the fiduciary. Funds held in care are not the fiduciary's property, and the client is not a creditor. So in case of bankruptcy, if the funds have been properly kept separate, they can easily be returned to the client. If, however, the funds have been commingled, the client is potentially subject to becoming entangled in the bankruptcy proceedings, and there may not be sufficient funds to pay the client back. Examples =Tenant deposits= For example, a tenant who deposits money with a landlord has not lent money to the landlord ‚Äì the tenant is not a creditor ‚Äì and is entitled to their deposit back even in case that the landlord declares bankruptcy, assuming property is in good condition ‚Äì the tenant is responsible for the property, but is not undertaking credit risk.John W. Reilly, The Language of Real Estate (2000), p. 75. =Investment funds= Similarly, a client who invests with a fund or broker is investing, not lending, so the fiduciary must keep the client money separate and not use it for their own purposes, but only for approved investment purposes: the client is subject to investment risk on their money, but not credit risk regarding the fiduciary.Alfred M. Pollard and Joseph P. Daly, Banking Law in the United States - Fourth Edition (2014), 14-58 to 14-59. =Lawyers and brokers= The problem of commingling is of particular concern in the legal profession. Attorneys are strictly prohibited from commingling their clients' funds with their own, and such activity is grounds for disbarment in virtually every jurisdiction, because of the ease of embezzlement and the difficulty of detection.Cynthia Traina Donnes, Practical Law Office Management (2016), p. 318. Similar rules apply for licensed real estate brokers handling earnest money and other professionals who hold deposits as agents for clients in absentia.Stephen Mettling, David Cusic, Principles of Real Estate Practice (2014), p. 177. = Corporations = Commingling is also evidence that may be used in \\"piercing the corporate veil\\" of a sham corporation, where a person shields himself from personal liability through \\"incorporation\\", yet fails to observe strict separation of corporate and personal property or accounts, among other improprieties. For small business, strict separation of corporate and personal property is a particular issue, notably in tax and divorce law. Community property In community property states of the United States, \\"commingling\\" non-marital property with marital property can make it community property.William H. Pivar, Robert Bruss, California Real Estate Law (2002), p. 251. For example, depositing money received by an individual through inheritance ‚Äì ordinarily considered non-marital, individual property ‚Äì into a joint bank account may transform the money into community property. Most community property states apply a presumption of community property; where there is any commingling the burden of proof is on the party disputing the classification to \\"trace\\" the property back to individual property, and demonstrate an intent to keep it separated.

WHTS is owned and operated by Cumulus Media and transmits with an ERP of 20,000 watts. It is heard as far north as Tustin, as far south as Otsego, and as far east as Carson City, Michigan; under the right conditions it can be heard as far away as Clare, Michigan. History WHTS signed on in 1984 from its original city of license of Hart, Michigan. The call letters were WCXT and it had an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts and covered a large amount of West Michigan; although the station mentioned Hart, Muskegon, Ludington and Grand Haven in its top-of- the-hour ID, it could be heard clearly out to Manistee, Big Rapids, and Holland, and across Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. It could be heard all the way east to Portland just west of Lansing. It had various rock formats, including ABC's short-lived Z-Rock format, until 1988, when it shifted to Soft AC as \\"Light Mix 105.3.\\" As an AC station, WCXT was almost completely automated and voice-tracked except for the morning show, which was hosted by Mark Waters (son of the station's owner Nancy Waters). The original owner was Waters Broadcasting. On July 2, 1999, control of the station was transferred under an LMA (Local Marketing Agreement) to Harbor Pointe Entertainment, which then switched the format to dance CHR as \\"105.3 The Whip,\\" targeting the Grand Rapids market. 105.3 The Whip consisted mostly of various dance mixes of CHR and Rhythmic CHR hits with a scattering of hits from Billboard's dance charts. A call letter change to WWIP was planned, but never happened. In the fall of 1999, the LMA was canceled due to various legal problems with Harbor Pointe Entertainment, at which time WCXT returned to the AC format under a slightly different slogan/positioner, \\"105-3, Your More Music Station.\\" Other than the new slogan, the format was more or less exactly the same as before \\"The Whip\\" experiment, largely voicetracked and automated and with very few commercials. In 2001, a construction permit for a new station on 105.3 in Mukwonago, Wisconsin (now WLVE) serving Milwaukee was given the go ahead to sign on. Because WCXT regularly DXed across Lake Michigan in the Milwaukee and Sheboygan areas, Salem Communications (which owned the now-WLVE at the time) paid the owners of WCXT to downgrade its signal from 100 kW to 28,000 watts. In late 2004, WCXT was granted a CP to move into the Grand Rapids/Muskegon area. In early 2005, it was announced that WCXT would be sold to Citadel Broadcasting, with speculation about what would air once the station was newly built out in Grand Rapids. In winter 2005, the format was flipped to a 100% jockless and commercial free classic country format as \\"Classic Country 105.3\\" upon Citadel's takeover of the station. This would turn out to be a filler format until the transmitter move would be finalised. In late April 2006, the new transmitter and city of license (from Hart to Coopersville) hit the airwaves, and the station began stunting with various sound effects such as drills and hammers, accompanied by announcements that a new station is being built and that classic country had been moved to 92.5 FM (WKOQ, later changing calls to WLAW). A few days later, the stunting switched to \\"Reality Radio,\\" featuring various Citadel hosts talking about the upcoming format, among other things. On May 2, 2006 at 7:40 pm, 105.3 relaunched as Hot FM. The first song played on Hot FM was \\"Bad Day\\" by Daniel Powter. Until the midday hours of May 3, the station ran a 20‚Äì30 song loop with an extended period of dead air between the songs. This was likely due to a music load and automation problem. The station picked up the WHTS callsign after 98.9, Rock Island, Illinois, dropped it in 2006. The old WHTS also was a top 40 station. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

A colonel is the highest rank of senior officer. A colonel is senior to a lieutenant-colonel or naval commander, and junior to a brigadier- general or commodore. Typical appointments for colonels include: * Base commander (BComd) * Wing commander (Wg Comd) * Commanding officer of a school or training establishment, such as commandant of the Canadian Army Command and Staff College, or commander of Combat Training Centre Gagetown * Commander of a brigade group * Branch advisor * Military attach√© to foreign nations The rank insignia for air force uniform is four stripes, worn on the cuffs of the service dress jacket, and on slip-ons on other uniforms. The insignia for army uniform is two stars and a crown. The insignia worn on the headdress for an army colonel is the crest of the Canadian coat of arms: a crowned gold lion with a maple leaf in its paw standing on a red-and-white wreath, all beneath the royal crown; the collar insignia is two crossed sabres. Some colonels, by nature of holding a specific appointment, may continue to wear the insignia of their personnel branch or regiment; for example, the honorary colonel of an infantry regiment. Air force colonels wear the badge of their personnel branch (most often the Air Operations Branch) on their headdress. Colonels are addressed by rank and name; thereafter by subordinates as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\". Before unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, rank structure and insignia followed the British pattern.

Rather, they serve in a ceremonial manner, often as a guest of honour at parades, mess dinners, or at other military traditions such as during Remembrance Day. Usually, honorary ranks are filled by people who have had a prior association with the battalion, regiment, or squadron they represent. Princess Patricia of Connaught was the colonel-in-chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, one of the most decorated infantry regiments in the Canadian Forces (CF). An honorary colonel of a CF flying or air maintenance squadron may be a past commanding officer of that squadron (who has since retired from active duty), or an air ace during the war.

USMC Combat Utility Uniform and previously worn on the former Desert Camouflage Uniform and Battle Dress Uniform. In the United States Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force, colonel () is the most senior field grade military officer rank, immediately above the rank of lieutenant colonel and just below the rank of brigadier general. It is equivalent to the naval rank of captain in the other uniformed services. By law, an officer previously required at least 22 years of cumulative service and a minimum of three years as a lieutenant colonel before being promoted to colonel. With the signing of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019 (NDAA 2019), military services now have the authorization to direct commission new officers up to the rank of Colonel. The pay grade for colonel is O-6. When worn alone, the insignia of rank seen at right is worn centered on headgear and fatigue uniforms. When worn in pairs, the insignia is worn on the officer's left side while a mirror- image reverse version is worn on the right side, such that both of the eagles faces forward to the wearer's front. Insignia William Few in the uniform of a Continental Army colonel The insignia for a colonel is a silver eagle which is a stylized representation of the eagle dominating the Great Seal of the United States (which is the coat of arms of the United States). As on the Great Seal, the eagle has a U.S. shield superimposed on its chest and is holding an olive branch and bundle of arrows in its talons. However, in simplification of the Great Seal image, the insignia lacks the scroll in the eagle's mouth and the rosette above its head. On the Great Seal, the olive branch is always clutched in the eagle's right-side talons, while the bundle of arrows is always clutched in the left-side talons. The head of the eagle faces towards the olive branch, rather than the arrows, advocating peace rather than war. As a result, the head of the eagle always faces towards the viewer's left. However, when worn as a single insignia with no matching pair, such as on the patrol cap, garrison cap/flight cap, or the front of the Army ACU, there is a split between the services on which mirror image of the eagle should be worn. In the United States Army and United States Air Force, the eagle is always worn with \\"the head of the eagle to the wearer's right,\\" with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's right hand talons (see Department of the Army Pamphlet 670-1, paragraph 19-6 (a)(1)). In the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, United States Coast Guard and NOAA, the eagle is worn with \\"the head facing forward\\" on the wearer's right side of the garrison cover (see Marine Corps Order P1020.34G, Uniform Regulation, paragraph 4005d(1)). Since respective service's officer insignia is worn on the left side and the rank insignia is worn on the right hand side of the Marine, Navy, Coast Guard and NOAA garrison caps, the eagle is facing to the eagle's left with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's left hand talons, which is a mirror opposite to the wear of the single eagle for Army and Air Force officers. Origins The United States rank of colonel is a direct successor to the same rank in the British Army. The first colonels in the U.S. were appointed from Colonial militias maintained as reserves to the British Army in the North American colonies. Upon the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, colonial legislatures would grant commissions to men to raise a regiment and serve as its colonel. Thus, the first U.S. colonels were usually respected men with ties in local communities and active in politics. With the post-war reduction of the U.S. Army, the rank of colonel disappeared, and was not re- introduced until 1802. The first insignia for the rank of colonel consisted of gold epaulettes worn on the blue uniform of the Continental Army. The first recorded use of the eagle insignia was in 1805 as this insignia was made official in uniform regulations by 1810. 19th century A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army The rank of colonel was relatively rare in the early 19th century, partly because the U.S. Army was very small, and the rank was usually obtained only after long years of service. During the War of 1812 the Army grew rapidly and many colonels were appointed, but most of these colonels were discharged when their regiments were disbanded at the war's conclusion. A number of other colonels were appointed by brevet - an honorary promotion usually for distinguished service in combat. The American Civil War saw a large influx of colonels as the rank was commonly held in both the Confederate army and Union Army by those who commanded a regiment. Since most regiments were state formations and were quickly raised, the colonels in command of the regiments were known by the title \\"Colonel of Volunteers,\\" in contrast to Regular Army colonels who held permanent commissions. During the Civil War, the Confederate Army maintained a unique insignia for colonel, three stars worn on the collar of a uniform. Robert E. Lee wore this insignia due to his former rank in the United States Army and refused to wear the insignia of a Confederate general, stating that he would only accept permanent promotion when the South had achieved independence. After the Civil War, the rank of colonel again became rare as the forces of the United States Army became extremely small. However, many colonels were appointed in the volunteers during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, prominent among them Theodore Roosevelt and David Grant Colson. 20th century A U.S. Marine colonel (center) during the Vietnam War. Colonel Jeanette Sustad as Director of Women Marines. World War I and World War II saw the largest numbers of colonels ever appointed in the U.S. military. This was mostly due to the temporary ranks of the National Army and the Army of the United States, where those who would normally hold the rank of Captain in the peacetime Regular Army were thrust into the rank of colonel during these two wars. The Military Promotion System was revised and standardized for all the services in 1980 as a result of passage of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. 21st century Modern U.S. colonels usually command Army infantry, artillery, armor, aviation or other types of brigades, USMC regiments, Marine Expeditionary Units or Marine Aircraft Groups, and USAF groups or wings. An Army colonel typically commands brigade-sized units (4,000 to 6,000 soldiers), with another colonel or a lieutenant colonel as deputy commander, a major as executive officer, and a command sergeant major as a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) advisor. An Air Force colonel typically commands a wing consisting of 1,000 to 4,000+ airmen with another colonel as the vice commander and a Command Chief Master Sergeant as principal senior NCO enlisted adviser. Some USAF colonels are commanders of groups, which are the four major components of wings. Colonels are also found as the chief of staff at divisional level-(Army) or Numbered Air Force-level staff agencies. In the modern armed forces, the colonel's eagle is worn facing forward with head and beak pointing towards the wearer's front. Of all U.S. military commissioned officer rank, only the colonel's eagle has a distinct right and left insignia. All other commissioned officer rank insignia can be worn on either the right or left side. Colonels are sometimes referred to (but not addressed as) full colonels, bird colonels, or full bird colonels because lieutenant colonels are also referred to and addressed in correspondence as \\"colonel.\\" Referring to an \\"O-6\\", a colonel's pay grade, also may differentiate colonels and lieutenant colonels, who have a pay grade of \\"O-5\\". Almost all Army colonels have attended a war college or a senior staff college equivalent to study joint warfare and war itself. Most Army colonels receive postgraduate level senior joint professional military education (JPME) at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania prior to promotion. The 2009 graduating class was 336 including 198 army officers and the rest divided among other military branches, domestic inter-agency representatives and other foreign military leaders.carlisle.army.mil The highest concentration of USAF colonels graduate from the Air War College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama via in-residence at Maxwell AFB. This program will include participation by officers from various other branches. Marine colonels may graduate from the Marine War College or, like all other branches, may receive credit via non-resident attendance at another installation, via correspondence, or will be graduates of an equivalent senior JPME program sponsored by the National Defense University or one of the other U.S. military services. Honorary colonels Some people known as \\"colonels\\" are actually recipients of honorary colonel ranks from a state governor and are not officers of the U.S. military. In the 19th century, the honorary colonels were military appointments and they still are nominally appointed to a governor's staff, but without military rights or duties. Famous honorary colonels include Colonel Harland Sanders of KFC fame, a Kentucky colonel; Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's manager, who received the honor from a Louisiana governor; and Edward M. House, known as Colonel House, a Texas honorary colonel and adviser to President Woodrow Wilson.

British colonels are not usually field commanders; typically they serve as staff officers between field commands at battalion and brigade level. The insignia is two diamond-shaped pips (properly called \\"Bath Stars\\") below a crown. The crown has varied in the past with different monarchs; the current Queen's reign has used St Edward's Crown. The rank is equivalent to captain in the Royal Navy and group captain in the Royal Air Force. Etymology The rank of colonel was popularized by the tercios that were employed in the Spanish Army during the 16th and 17th centuries. General Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba divided his troops in to coronel√≠as (meaning \\"column of soldiers\\" from the Latin, columnella or \\"small column\\"O.E.D.). These units were led by a coronel.Los tercios espa√±oles. La batalla de Pav√≠a at militar.org.ua (in Spanish, unspecified authorship) This command structure and its titles were soon adopted as colonello in early modern Italian and in Middle French as coronel. The rank title entered the English language from French in the mid-16th century and so the modern English pronunciation of the word is derived from the French variant. History The use of the rank of colonel pre-dates the establishment of the United Kingdom. In the mid-17th century, the regiments of the New Model Army were commanded by colonels. The British Army has historically been organized around the regiment, with each regiment being raised, uniformed, and equipped either directly by the crown or by a nobleman. The colonels nominally commanding these regiments often had little to do with the regiment's actual activities, either because they contemporaneously served as general officers or because they were essentially mere financiers. By the end of 17th century in Great Britain, the \\"colonel of a regiment\\" was often a titled person who had been given Royal Assent to raise it for service and command it in battle. As such, he was required to cover all costs of the regiment's equipment, uniforms and wages as well select its officers.George Usher, Dictionary of British Military History, A & C Black, London 2006 Until the late 18th century most British regiments were commonly known by the name of the colonelcy, for example Lord Churchill's Dragoons (1683-1685) or Elliot's Light Horse (1759-66). By the start of the American Revolutionary War most English and Welsh regiments in the standing army of Great Britain were named numerically, although some independent Highland regiments -- such as MacLeod's Highlanders -- were raised in the name of their colonel for service in West Africa and India. The change from a colonelcy based on patronage was because the British Army's administration had been reformed into three administrative bodies: * The War Office was that responsible for day-to-day administration of the army, and for the cavalry and infantry; * The Board of Ordnance was responsible for the supply of weapons and ammunition, and administered the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers; * The Commissariat was responsible for the supply of rations and transport. It occasionally raised its own fighting units, such as \\"battoemen\\" (armed watermen and pioneers in North America). The reforms meant that the British government was now financially responsible for the pay, clothing and equipment of the troops in the service of the British Crown. Colonels were also no longer permitted to profit directly from the sale of officer commissions in their regiments. A lieutenant-colonel commanded the regiment in battle. By the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, the title \\"colonel of the regiment\\" had become a sinecure appointment for distinguished generals and members of the royal family or British nobility. Despite an individual only being permitted to hold one colonelcy, it was a profitable position as they were in financial charge of their regiment's allowance from the government. This meant they could hope to make a profit on the funds allocated for equipment, supplies and uniforms. As generals were mostly on half-pay, a colonelcy was a method of providing them with extra income. Many colonels spent large sums of their own money on their regiments. By the end of the 19th century, the reorganisation of the British Army through the Cardwell and Childers Reforms had established a colonel as a professional rank with senior administrative responsibilities in regiment or brigade. Ceremonial usage =Colonel-in-Chief= Another title employed by the British Army is \\"Colonel-in-Chief\\" which is distinct from the ceremonial title \\"Colonel of the Regiment\\". The position is usually held by a member of the Royal Family who acts as a patron to the unit, as Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, did for the Bermuda Regiment. Although they do not have an operational role, they are kept informed of all important activities undertaken by the regiment and pay occasional visits to its operational units. The chief purpose of a colonel-in-chief is to maintain a direct link between a given regiment and the British Royal Family. =Colonel of the Regiment= Some of the historic duties associated with the title Colonel of the Regiment (to distinguish it from the military rank of colonel) continue to be used in the modern British Army. The ceremonial position is often conferred on retired general officers, brigadiers or colonels who have a close link to a particular regiment. Non- military personnel, usually for positions within the Army Reserve, may also be appointed to the ceremonial position. When attending functions as \\"Colonel of the Regiment\\", the titleholder wears the regimental uniform with rank insignia of (full) colonel, regardless of their official rank. A member of the Royal Family is known as a Royal Colonel. A Colonel of the Regiment is expected to work closely with a regiment and its regimental association. =Honorary Colonel= Regiments or units may have an Honorary Colonel; which is solely a Ceremonial rank, that can also be held by a civilian, with no military service. If the appointment is held by a member of the Royal Family it is known as Royal Honorary Colonel . Certain units may have one or more Deputy Colonels.List of Honorary Colonels in the British Army =Colonel of Marines= The Royal Navy once conveyed the honorific title \\"Colonel of Marines\\" to post-captains as a reward for highly distinguished service. It was a salaried sinecure position with no additional obligations outside a captain's normal naval duties. He would lose this title and its additional pay upon reaching flag rank. Horatio Nelson was given such a colonelcy in 1795, two years before he reached flag rank. The life of Nelson: the embodiment of the sea power of Great Britain, Volume 1 - Alfred Thayer Mahan, 1897 Royal Air Force From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of colonel. During this period, groups were often commanded by RAF colonels. The rank of colonel was superseded by that of group captain on 1 August 1919.  Historical insignia  When badges of rank were introduced for field officers in 1810, full colonels were designated with a crown and star worn on shoulder epaulettes. In 1855, after the Crimean War, new dress regulations were published which specified changes where rank would be worn. Thereafter full colonels wore half-inch regimental pattern laces on upper and lower collar, with one crown and one star. In 1880 the insignia was moved to the shoulder boards when in full dress, and full colonels were given an extra star. The pattern of a crown above two stars has remained the identifying insignia from 1880 to the present day although it has variously been worn on the shoulder, cuff and chest.

(2007) Dutch painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 512.3 May 1703) was a Dutch painter of historical scenes, portraits and elegant, fashionable people, and later of landscapes. Life Kandaules' wife discovers Gyges, 1675-1680. Van der Neer was born in Amsterdam and was probably first taught by his father, Aert van der Neer, who married in Amsterdam in 1629, coming from Gorinchem. Eglon had a least five brothers and sisters, who were baptized in the Nieuwe Kerk between 1640 and 1650. He took lessons from Jacob van Loo, who was then one of the foremost figure painters in Amsterdam. Around 1654, Van der Neer, who probably had just finished his education with van Loo, traveled to Orange, Vaucluse in the south of France and entered the service of Friedrich von Dohna (1621‚Äì1688), governor of the Principality of Orange. Van der Neer stayed for three or four years in Orange and returned to Amsterdam by the end of 1658. There he married (in February) Maria Wagensvelt, the daughter of a wealthy Rotterdam notary. In 1663, van der Neer and his family moved to Rotterdam, where Adriaen van der Werff became his student. He stayed in Rotterdam until his wife died in 1677. In 1679, he moved to The Hague. In 1680 he became a member of the Confrerie Pictura there. Later that year he moved again, taking up his residence at Brussels, where he married the miniature painter Marie Du Chastel in the following year. She bore him nine children. =Painter for royalty= In Brussels, van der Neer established a good relationship with the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, the Marquess of Castanaga. In 1687, van der Neer was appointed court painter to the Spanish King Charles II of Spain. In 1689, when Carlos' first wife died, van der Neer portrayed one of the new wedding candidates, Maria Anna of Neuburg. In 1695, Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine bought a painting by van der Neer in Rotterdam, when traveling through the Netherlands. This painting must have pleased him, because shortly thereafter the Elector Palatine contacted van der Neer directly and gave him commissions. In that same year Brussels was bombarded by French troops and van der Neer started to look for another place to begin a new life. The Elector Palatine had been looking for a replacement ever since his last court painter Johannes Spilberg had died in 1690. Van der Neer's second wife had died in 1692, and he met Spilberg's daughter, herself a qualified painter, Adriana Spilberg. They married in 1697 and in 1698 Johann Wilhelm offered Van der Neer the position at his court as head painter. Van der Neer thus settled in D√ºsseldorf and remained there for these last years of his life. Legacy During his Amsterdam and Rotterdam period, van der Neer primarily painted genre scenes and portraits that betray a stunning variety of styles. His interior scenes show the influence of Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, Gabriel Metsu and Frans van Mieris. Van der Neer painted only a handful of mythological and Biblical scenes.Judith in the National Gallery by Eglon van der Neer The early examples are very similar to his genre scenes and show figures in contemporary interiors. Later, in Brussels and D√ºsseldorf, van der Neer set his historical scenes outdoors, with a landscape setting. In these paintings he followed the example of Adam Elsheimer. His pure landscapes, without figures from literary sources, show other stylistic influences, such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, and Jacques d'Arthois. Most of van der Neer's paintings are small and his style is highly finished. However, he could work on a large scale and would then adjust his manner of painting.

Geography The city of Coronel is located in a sandy platform that goes from the mouth of the Biob√≠o River to the Arauco Gulf bay, a muddy landscape, full of forests, typical of the region. This muddy, forested landscape enclosed by high mountains was what the first Spanish conquistadors and settlers found when arriving. Vegetation and forests covered most of the area except very close to the coast. This type of landscape is characteristic of the province. The total area of the commune is . Aside from its western coast along the Pacific Ocean, the commune is surrounded by other communes of the Concepci√≥n Province: San Pedro de la Paz to the north, Hualqui to the north and east, and Lota and Santa Juana to the south. Santa Mar√≠a Island also forms part of the city, which is represented there by a municipal delegate.  Climate  The climate of Coronel is temperate Mediterranean, common to the Chilean Coast Range, with moderate temperature variations. As Coronel is situated west of the mountain range, it generally receives winds out of the west and northwest, and increased precipitation due to orographic lift. Its proximity to the Pacific influences its annual temperature variations. The average temperature in summer is and in winter.  History  Like all territory to the south of Biob√≠o River, this area was populated by the Mapuche. Historically, Spaniards called them as Araucan√≠ans (araucanos) and their coastal territory as Araucan√≠a. This territory is a part of the Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia, an unrecognised state established on November 19, 1861. The indigenous population of Coronel Bay was located into a war zone called Butanmapu de la costa. From the descriptions made by the Spaniards, it is probable that before the Spaniards' colonization, half of the Mapuche population lived in this region. Also, the population density of the tribes was evenly distributed on both east and west sides of the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta The city of Lota was an early coal mining settlement in the area. The mine was composed of \\"Chiflones\\" 1, 2, 3, 4, Pique Santa Maria, and Pique Arenas Blancas. This was the last mine closed, because of a grisu gas explosion where 21 miners died. This mine was the deepest in South America, at . The World War I naval Battle of Coronel between ships of the United Kingdom and Germany was fought on 1 November 1914 off the coast of Coronel. The city was the seat of Lautaro Department, later known as the Coronel Department. In March 2013, after thousands of sea animals washed ashore an investigation was started. Thousands of prawns wash ashore in Chile March 21, 2013 Euronews Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Coronel spans an area of and has 95,528 inhabitants (46,766 men and 48,762 women). Of these, 91,469 (95.8%) lived in urban areas and 4,059 (4.2%) in rural areas. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 14.5% (12,102 persons). The demonym for a man from Coronel is Coronelino and Coronelina for a woman. Administration As a commune, Coronel is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a communal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is Leonidas Romero. The communal council has the following members: * Jos√© Suazo Mu√±oz * Francisco Merino Olivares * Edmundo Salas Norambuena * Francisco Reyes Aguayo * Daniel Rosales Salgado * Hugo Monsalves Obreque * Carmen Madinagoitia Chamorro * Osvaldo Campos Torres Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Coronel is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Marcelo Ch√°vez (PDC) and Clemira Pacheco (PS) as part of the 45th electoral district, (together with Tom√©, Penco, Florida, Hualqui and Santa Juana). The commune is represented in the Senate by Alejandro Navarro Brain (MAS) and Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe Herrera (UDI) as part of the 12th senatorial constituency (Biob√≠o-Cordillera).

Completed for the Dutch in 1953 as HNLMS De Ruyter (C801), she was acquired by Peru in 1973 and served as fleet flagship. Almirante Grau underwent a major modernization program between 1985 and 1988 during which she was fitted with new weapons and electronics. She was the last gun cruiser in service in any navy before being decommissioned on 26 September 2017. In 2019, it was announced that she would be preserved as a museum ship.  Construction  De Ruyter was laid down by the Royal Netherlands Navy on 5 September 1939 as the cruiser HNLMS De Zeven Provinci√´n at the Wilton- Fijenoord shipyard at Schiedam. She and her sister-ship, later ', were intended to replace the two s in the Dutch East Indies. At the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 little had been constructed. The Kriegsmarine intended to complete her as the training cruiser KH 1 but construction was slow and she was not launched until 24 December 1944, with the intent by then to use her as a blockship in the Nieuwe Waterweg, the approaches to Rotterdam. After the liberation of the Netherlands, the Navy completed De Zeven Provinci√´n with modifications, and she was commissioned as HNLMS De Ruyter (C801) on 18 November 1953.  Royal Netherlands Navy service  In Dutch service both ships participated in several NATO exercises, and were frequently used as flagships for different naval task forces. Between 1962 and 1964, De Zeven Provinci√´n underwent a refit which included the removal of the two aft turrets and the installation of a RIM-2 Terrier SAM system, but lack of funds precluded the same modifications from being carried out in De Ruyter. After two decades in service, she was decommissioned on 16 October 1972.  Peruvian Navy service  The Peruvian Navy bought De Ruyter on 7 March 1973 as a counter to the acquisition of the Swedish cruiser by the Chilean Navy. Commissioned on 23 May 1973 as Almirante Grau, in honor of the Peruvian Admiral Miguel Grau, the ship arrived at her new homeport of Callao on 11 July 1973. She was designated fleet flagship in succession to another cruiser of the same name (the former ), which was renamed . = Modernization = From 1985 until 1988, she underwent a major modernization program by Amsterdam Naval Services (ANS) at its shipyard in Amsterdam, during which she was denominated Proyecto de Modernizaci√≥n 01 (Modernization Project 01) or PM-01. Her role as flagship was assumed by her sistership as Almirante Grau. Both ships regained their former names when the former De Ruyter returned to Callao on 15 February 1988. The upgrade program carried out in the Netherlands included the following: * Fitting of the Signaal SEWACO Foresee PE combat management system * Fitting of a Signaal DA-08 surface-search radar * Fitting of a Signaal LW-08 air-search radar * Fitting of a Decca 1226 navigation radar * Fitting of a Signaal STIR-24 fire-control radar * Fitting of a Signaal WM-25 fire-control radar * Fitting of two Signaal LIROD-8 optronic directors * Fitting of the Signaal Rapids ESM system * Fitting of the CME Scimitar ECM system * Fitting of two Matra D√©fense Dagaie decoy launchers * Fitting of one Matra D√©fense Sagaie decoy launcher * Fitting of a Link Y data link * Fitting (towers) of two Bofors signal amplifiers, including aiming and firing limitation * Removal of four twin Bofors 57/60 mm gun mountings * Removal of the CWE-610 hull sonar Further work was carried out by SIMA dockyards in Callao as follows: * Eight Otomat Mk 2 SSMs were fitted in 1993 * Two OTO Melara Twin 40L70 DARDO compact gun mountings were fitted in 1996, replacing four single Bofors 40/70 mm gun mountings The LW-08 radar was later replaced by an AN/SPS-6, the former being installed in the frigate (FM-51) in 2003. Decommissioning Almirante Grau was decommissioned on 26 September 2017. She was the last gun cruiser in service in any navy, although its main armament was supplemented with Otomat anti-ship missiles. She was replaced by the BAP Montero, now known as BAP Almirante Grau.

The following eight holders of the Tora ni Bau title relocated and resided in the chiefly island of Batiki in the Lomaiviti province. The traditional Tora ni Bau lineage was empowered by the strong traditional ties of warriors (Bati) which included the chiefly tribes of Waimaro in the Naitasiri province , including other warrior tribes along the coast of Tailevu and Ra. From the Lomaiviti province, warrior (Bati) linkages were led by the warrior clans of Sawaieke in Gau, and Cawa in Koro island. Traditional protocol between some Chiefs and warriors (Bati), is the Chief's abstinence of consumption of fish in the presence of warriors, and the abstinence of pork for the warriors in the presence of their chiefs. This is still somewhat practiced today, and was also one of the reasons the eighth Tora ni Bau, Ratu Isireli Mocelakolako relocated to the island of Batiki in the Lomaiviti group.

VKB, FIJIAN HERITAGE I SEVATI, FIJI History The title of the Tora ni Bau, which translates as Watchtower of Bau, was created by Gudrunavanua, a high chief and warlord from Sawaieke on the island of Gau for his nephew Savai in the 18th century. Gudrunavanua feared that Bau posed a threat to the neighboring islands. A similar title and responsibility was created on the delta village of Nabitu in Tokatoka by the Sawaieke Warlord. This had a strategic purpose as he was planning to launch an assault on the Rewan Roko Tui Dreketi, the King of the delta villages. Gudrunavanua, who was of Samoan ancestry, was famous for bestowing upon himself the title of Takala- i-Gau, or ruler of the island of Gau. His successor was named Toravi Nadawa or guardian of Nadawa. It was Toravi Nadawa who brought the Tui Dreketi to his knees begging for his life in Nabitu.

Vengeance carries the Trident ballistic missile, the UK's nuclear deterrent. Vengeance was built at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions), was launched in September 1998, and commissioned in November 1999. Before she was commissioned, the British Government stated that once the Vanguard submarines became fully operational, they would only carry 200 warheads. Vengeance carries unopened \\"last instructions\\" (letters of last resort) of the current British Prime Minister that are to be used in the event of a national catastrophe or a nuclear strike; this letter is identical to the letters carried on board the other three submarines of the Vanguard class. Reviewed on Operational history On 31 March 2011, while on a training exercise Vengeance suffered a blockage in her propulsor causing a reduction in propulsion. The boat returned to Faslane naval base on the surface under her own power. According to the MOD the problems were not nuclear related. In 2012, Vengeance started a 40 month refit at HMNB Devonport near Plymouth which refueled her reactor and renewed her machinery and electronics. During that period her sister ship Vigilant took her place in the patrol rotations. She sailed from Devonport on 4 December 2015, her place in refit being taken by Vanguard.

The complex is located in Central, Hong Kong, occupying the lower level of Government Hill. The offices of the government have been relocated to the Main Block of the Central Government Complex, Tamar.  History  Completed in 1957 by the Government of Hong Kong, it replaced a two-storey colonial complex from the 1930s, old Secretariat Building (built in 1847 and demolished in 1954). Like Hong Kong City Hall, the offices were built in the International style.  Legislative Council  Until 1985, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong met here and then moved to the old Supreme Court Building.  Government offices  All major government departments except the Department of Justice are now located at (or moving to) the Central Government Complex, Tamar. The Department of Justice is remained at the former Central Government Offices Main and East Wing, and renamed as 'Justice Place. =Former home= The building that formerly housed the offices were actually a complex of three wings with a total of of offices: * Main Wing (18 Lower Albert Road) - 8 floors and Annex * East Wing (20 Lower Albert Road) * West Wing (11 Ice House Street) - 7-13 floors The most familiar wing was the Main Wing, housing offices of the Chief Executive and site of most major protests against the Hong Kong Government (another site is the LegCo). In order to keep protesters who have not applied from entering the complex, a series of fences was erected in 1998 after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997. Plans are under way to replace the current buildings with a new office at the Tamar basin and scheduled to be completed by 2010. Apart from government offices, the Tamar site will also house the Legislative Council and provide not less than 22,000 square metres of open space for public enjoyment. The cost for developing the entire Tamar site is estimated at HKD5.2 billion. Plans after 2011 will likely see the Justice Department re-locate to the Main and East Wings. The government has proposed to demolish the West Wing while community groups are proposing to protect the historic site.CE lays out his vision for a greener and more vibrant Hong Kong List of tenants of the three complexes: * West Wing ** Civil Service Bureau ** Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau ** Economic Development Bureau ** Housing, Planning and Lands Bureau * Main Wing ** Constitutional Affairs Bureau ** Security Bureau ** Chief Executive * East Wing ** Security Bureau  See also  * Central Government Complex, Tamar * Government Secretariat (Hong Kong) * Legislative Council Building  References  * Sing Pao Star Daily, 23 October 2005 No 176, p 50-52  External links  * Old Secretariat Building * Central Government Offices, Historic and Architectural Appraisal, 2009 * \\"Our Government Hill\\" * Public Views Invited on the Proposed Gradings of the Post 1950 Former Central Government Offices, Plans and Photos, Reference materials Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Government buildings completed in 1957 Category:Government buildings in Hong Kong Category:Government Hill Category:Landmarks in Hong Kong Hong Kong - Central Government Offices ","title":"Former Central Government Offices"},{"id":"2989425","text":"Ch√© Caf√© sign The Ch√© Caf√© is a worker co-operative, social center, and live music venue located on the University of California San Diego campus in La Jolla, California, USA. Zack de la Rocha described the Ch√© Caf√© as \\"A place that is not only a great venue, but a source of inspiration and community building for any artist, student, or worker that has entered its doors.\\" History Mural on Che Cafe building Ch√© Caf√© was founded in 1980 by several UCSD students, including Scott Kessler, Ruth Rominger, Kim Higgs, and Joy Every. The name \\"Ch√©\\" in \\"Ch√© Caf√©\\" is not only a nod to the late Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, but it is also a backronym for \\"Cheap Healthy Eats\\". The latter name was registered with the university administration in an attempt to avoid political scrutiny. During the 1980s, collective members began to host reggae and punk rock shows, and in the 1990s, the space became an internationally recognized staple of the hardcore/punk/post-punk/indie rock scene. Today, the Ch√© operates primarily as a venue for a variety of musical genres, many based around the DIY ethic like Spotify artist Postcard Boy, and is an on-and-off again vegan cafe and catering operation. It also acts as a resource for the music and art departments on campus through hosting art shows, performances and film screenings. =UCSD administration clashes= Despite the university's initial support for the co-ops at UCSD, the relationship between the university and student co-ops has been in decline, with recent improvements made through mediation since 2003. The Ch√© Caf√© in particular has for a long time had a very strained relationship with the university, and as with the other co-ops, there have been numerous attempts made by the university to close the space. In the spring of 2000, UCSD attempted to close the space by changing the locks without members' consent, resulting in a lock-in by members and supporters. The UCSD administration cited as motivation a fight which occurred between two patrons at a show in which one was injured (though there has been much discrepancy as to what actually took place). Following the lock-in, the university tried to force the Ch√© to hire security guards for every show, but it was later ruled that the university did not have such authority under the 1993 memorandum of understanding between the co-ops and the university. In 2002, the Ch√© agreed to sponsor the BURN! collective's web project, which was previously sponsored by the co-op bookstore Groundwork Books. BURN! was a directory of radical websites, mailing lists, and resources. The BURN! directory included links to the web pages of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a US State Department designated foreign terrorist organization and the Kurdistan Worker's Party. This would be expanded on by then school newspaper The California Review in 2002, when they revealed the T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to be on the server as well. In 2004, the UCSD administration received a complaint about the link, accused the Ch√© Caf√© core members of providing \\"material support\\" to the FARC in violation of the USA Patriot Act, and threatened disciplinary action. In arbitration, it was determined that the BURN! project was not hosting the FARC's website, simply linking to it, and so the University subsequently dropped its threats against the Ch√© members. On October 21, 2014, the San Diego County Superior Court ruled in favor of UCSD's filing of eviction towards the cafe. Ch√© Caf√© was issued a notice it had to leave the premises within five days. The reasoning for the eviction claimed by the university related to unsubstantiated safety issues. Following this decision UCSD served the venue with an eviction notice on March 17, 2015. The Ch√© Caf√© was under 24/7 student-led occupation after this date, defying the court order. In July 2015, supporters of the Ch√© Caf√© met with UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, and following this, the university announced a 45-day stay of eviction and agreed to fund a professional inspection of the building to assess any necessary repairs and maintenance. They would later sign a new lease agreement following some renovation in 2017. It would not be until 2018 that the Cafe would finish its renovation and reopen as a venue.

Life and work  Duttweiler was born in Z√ºrich. Starting with five vehicles in 1925, his Migros eventually opened stores and is today one of the main grocery chains in Switzerland. The original secret to his success was bringing daily necessities to the consumer by excluding the middlemen. As a result, many producers initially chose to boycott Migros, and Duttweiler's Migros would itself manufacture or package those missing products. In 1941, Gottlieb and his wife Adele Duttweiler transferred ownership of Migros to their customers, as a cooperative. Duttweiler also required that Migros contribute a percentage of profits (actual from the total revenue) to cultural, athletic, and hobby- related activities. This led to the Migros-club-schools and several hobby courses. He also initiated the so-called Park im Gr√ºene or Dutti-Park at the site of the later institute that was named after Gottlieb Duttweiler. In 1949, he participated at the former Buchclub Ex Libris, which was integrated in the Migros group in 1956. The Z√ºrich-based Reederei Z√ºrich AG ordered at the H. C.

In 1958, he founded the Migros Bank. Duttweiler also founded the political party Alliance of Independents (Landesring der Unabh√§ngigen). Adele and Gottlieb Dutweiler established the Adele und Gottlieb Duttweiler Stiftung to ensure the future work of the Migros chain as a cooperative according to the founding act. Duttweiler died in Zurich. The Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute in R√ºschlikon was founded after his death.

In 2017, it had a population of 35,042. Immediately to the west of Saint-Rapha√´l lies a larger and older town, Fr√©jus; together they form an urban agglomeration known as Var Est√©rel M√©diterran√©e, which also encompasses the smaller communes of Les Adrets- de-l'Est√©rel, Puget-sur-Argens and Roquebrune-sur-Argens. In the second half of the 19th century, the township came under the influence of Mayor Felix Martin and writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr; owing to their efforts and its beneficial climate the commune developed into a seaside resort popular with artists, sportsmen and politicians. It is the seat of the canton of Saint- Rapha√´l, also encompassing Fr√©jus and Les Adrets-de-l'Est√©rel, which is the economic and cultural centre of Eastern Var, within the arrondissement of Draguignan. Its inhabitants are called Rapha√´lois in French generally, or Rafelencs in Proven√ßal Occitan. History In 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte and his forces arrived by ship from Egypt, prior to his coup d'√©tat in Paris, and landed at a fishing village that was the commune of Saint-Rapha√´l. The coastal double-track rail link between Saint-Rapha√´l and Nice passes over a substantial viaduct constructed right on the shoreline at Anth√©or. These tracks were of strategic importance to the Axis forces during World War II for supplying material to units in France. There were three separate air raids made on this viaduct from England, between September 1943 and February 1944, involving a total of thirty-one Lancaster bombers operating some seven hundred miles from base. Aircraft of the second raid flew on to Rabat, and from the third raid on to Sardinia. One Lancaster from the first raid was lost, and a flight lieutenant bomb aimer on the third raid was killed by enemy fire, some of which came from ships at sea. All the raids failed in their objective and the rail link was not severed. During World War II, on August 15, 1944, it was one of the sites of a beach landing in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Geography Saint-Rapha√´l is located at the extreme eastern end of the Var, along the border with the adjacent d√©partement of Alpes-Maritimes, which occupies the far south-eastern corner of France at the frontier with Italy. The commune has a total of thirty-six kilometres () of Mediterranean coastline,http://www.saint-raphael.com owing mainly to the many coves and creeks formed between the natural region of the Esterel Massif (Massif de l'Esterel) and the sea. This places it second only to Marseilles, with fifty-seven kilometres () of coastline. The commune is 89.59 km2 in extent. It is almost completely urbanised in the west, but includes over 60 km2 of protected areas of natural forest and the Esterel mountains. Saint- Rapha√´l has four large sandy beaches: one near the city centre, called the Veillat; one at Boulouris; one at Le Dramont, and the fourth at Agay. There are two smaller ones at Anth√©or and Le Trayas. =Rivers= Saint-Rapha√´l is separated from Fr√©jus by the River P√©d√©gal: fed by the Garonne, the Adrets- of-l'Esterel, Saint-Jean-de-Cannes and Saint-Jean-de-l'Esterel. The River Agay flows from the mountains down through the village of that name, and is fed by the streams Cabre, Perthus and Grenouillet. The Grenouillet is the most important of these streams, having average flows of between 43 cu m/s in July and 1160 cu m/s in January. The River Valescure, which is channelled through the Barrage des Crous (dam), discharges into the River Reyran at Fr√©jus. =Mountains= Commune de Saint-Rapha√´l includes Le Trayas at the extreme eastern end (at For√™t Domaniale de l'Est√©rel and Mediterranean Sea coast) From east to west the commune has several mountain summits rising from the massif. Mont Vinaigre in Fr√©jus stands at 618 metres (2027 ft), Rastel d'Agay at 287 m (942 ft), Pic de l'Ours (carrying a transmitter aerial) at 492 m (1614 ft), Pic du Cap Roux at 453 m (1486 ft), and Pic d'Aur√®le at 322 m (1056 ft). Situated almost entirely on the Esterel Massif, the commune sits on soil of red porphyr, which makes for very picturesque scenes along the coast where the soil and rocks are exposed on cliff faces and rocky shores. Three important and spectacular rocks dominate the seascape: Cap Roux at 360 m (1181 ft), Saint-Pilon at 295 m (968 ft), and the Rock of Saint-Barth√©lemy. =Adjacent places= Immediately to the west and north-west of Saint-Rapha√´l lies the ancient town of Fr√©jus. To the north lie the hamlets of Saint-Jean- de-l'Esterel et Saint-Jean-de-Cannes, both within the Fr√©jus commune. To the extreme north-east, beyond Le Trayas, is the small resort of Miramar, lying within the commune of Th√©oule-sur-Mer. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the south of the whole Saint-Rapha√´l commune. Climate St. Rapha√´l is located on the C√¥te d'Azur and enjoys a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters. The Mistral wind occurs, although sometimes the town is sheltered from this by the Massif des Maures and the Esterel. It is perhaps more exposed to the Levant (strong, easterly, wet) or the Sirocco (very strong, southerly, hot) air flows, but these occur rarely. The wind velocity record was established on 30 January 1986, with gusts of per hour.

Overview  Islands of Connacht The island is now uninhabited; the last 23 inhabitants of this former isolated fishing and farming community were evacuated on the 20th of October 1960. The islanders had been unable to leave for months in winter and the government opted to resettle them on the mainland rather than build an expensive pier on the island. Like Inishbofin, Inishark is composed almost entirely of Silurian slates and shales. It rises almost to above sea level. The documentary film Inis Airc, B√°s Oile√°in (Inishark, Death of an Island) produced in 2007 by C-Board Films for TG4, told the story of the last years and abandonment of Inishark. Produced and directed by Kieran Concannon, it featured interviews with surviving islanders and archive newsreel footage of the final evacuation. In 2009, Boston College's Irish Studies program (in cooperation with Irish Film Institute) screened Inis Airc, B√°s Oile√°in (Inishark, Death of an Island) as part of the Irish Studies Film Series telling the evacuation story from the surviving islanders viewpoint.  History  The island was occupied for thousands of years and has many Bronze Age sites such as burial grounds and monuments. The island's patron saint was Leo of Inis Airc, who lived there sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries. The remains of a 19th-century church named after him lie on the island today. On Easter Sunday, 1949 three young islanders drowned traveling to Inishbofin for mass. Soon after during a period when the island was cut off due to bad weather another young man died from appendicitis. Irish Islands - Inishbofin These incidents as well as emigration were contributing factors driving the clamour to evacuate the island as by this point there were few young people remaining on it.

The Nation is led by Chief Marcus Hardy. The council is an independent member of Union of Ontario Indians, a Tribal Political Organization. The First Nation is also a member of Waaskiinaysay Ziibi Inc., an economic development corporation made up of five Lake Nipigon First Nations. Members of the Red Rock Indian Band once lived in different locations on and around Lake Nipigon. Historically, members are known to have lived at Jackfish Island, Gull Bay, and McIntyre Bay (English Mission Church) also called Grand Bay. The Indian reserves are approximately 100 km northeast of the city of Thunder Bay and 2 km east of Nipigon. The total area covered by the two reserves is approximately . This site is also the location of Saint Sylvesters Church. St. Sylvester's Church was built in 1877, which was a Jesuit Mission. The first recorded burial was October 3, 1880. The grave yard is adjacent to the church and people are still buried there regularly. Although a historical landmark, the Church is no longer used as the building structure is unsafe. The Red Rock Indian Band is located within the 1850 Robinson Superior Treaty area. Band members use the Parmachene area regularly, for fishing, berry picking, hunting, trapping, gathering of medicinal plants, camping, and participate in traditional ceremonies. Blueberry picking in particular is enjoyed by many Red Rock Indian Band members. The Lake Helen Reserve 53A is the main community located on the shores of Lake Helen. Al Hackner, 2-time world curling champion, is a member of Red Rock Indian Band. The traditional Ojibwe name for the band is Opwaaganasiniing, which is the locative form of the word for pipestone.

Anna at The Priory, Hammersmith, 1900. Adam Gottlieb Hermann Muthesius (20 April 1861 ‚Äì 29 October 1927), known as Hermann Muthesius, was a German architect, author and diplomat, perhaps best known for promoting many of the ideas of the English Arts and Crafts movement within Germany and for his subsequent influence on early pioneers of German architectural modernism such as the Bauhaus. Southern facade of the Elena-Klinik in Harleshausen, a district of Kassel, whose main building was originally built by Hermann Muthesius as a villa. 2004-12-24  Early life Muthesius was born in 1861 in the village of Gro√üneuhausen near Erfurt and received early training from his father, who was a builder. After a period of military service and two years studying philosophy and art history at Frederick William University in Berlin, he enrolled to study architecture at Charlottenburg Technical College in 1883, while also working in the office of Reichstag architect Paul Wallot. Early career Following completion of his studies, Muthesius spent 1887 to 1891 working for German construction firm Ende & B√∂ckmann in Tokyo.\\"Hermann Muthesius: Architect and Writer\\". Mackintosh Architecture: Context, Making, Meaning. University of Glasgow. Accessed 8 September 2014.

Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies of Duke University. Accessed 8 September 2014.--and was able to travel extensively across Asia. He returned to Germany in 1891 where he worked for the Prussian Ministry of Public Works, studied for a time in Italy on stipend (in 1895), and served for almost two years as the editor of a pair of official construction journals. London In 1896 Muthesius was offered a position as cultural attach√© at the German Embassy in London. Muthesius married Anna Trippenbach who was a fashion designer and singer. This gave him the opportunity to study the ways of the British. He focused the next six years investigating residential architecture and domestic lifestyle and design, ending with a three-volume report published in 1904 and 1905 as ' (\\"The English House\\"), his most famous work.Woodham (1997), 18 Although his subjects were wide-ranging, he was particularly interested in the philosophy and practices of the English Arts and Crafts movement, whose emphasis on function, modesty, understatement, individuality and honesty to materials he saw as alternatives to the ostentatious historicism and obsession with ornament in German nineteenth century architecture, and whose efforts to bring a sense of craftsmanship to industrial design he saw as a significant national economic benefit. He visited Glasgow to investigate the innovative work of the Glasgow School exemplified by the designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and wrote about houses in Birmingham by William Bidlake. As well as his official reports, Muthesius also developed a career as an author, communicating his ideas and observations in an influential series of books and articles that saw him become a significant cultural figure in Germany, culminating in '. His wife wrote about Anti-fashion and how she felt that women were being exploited by German clothing industrialists. Her book which incorporated a novel binding designed by Frances MacDonald is considered an important contribution to the Artistic Dress movement. Muthesius wrote about Glasgow's Willow Tearooms for an issue of ' published in 1905 which was almost entirely devoted to A Mackintosh Tea Room in Glasgow, saying that \\"Today any visitor to Glasgow can rest body and soul in Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms and for a few pence drink tea, have breakfast and dream that he is in fairy land.\\" At the same time he lamented Mackintosh's unrewarded struggle to \\"hold up the banner of Beauty in this dense jungle of ugliness.\\"Dekorative Kunst, 1905 Back in Germany Muthesius returned to Germany in 1904 and established himself as an architect in private practice, while retaining a role as an official advisor to the Government of Prussia focusing his time on reforming art and design education in order that more emphasis be put on workshop training. Over the next two decades he designed a series of houses throughout Germany, drawing upon and cementing the principles and practices expounded in his famous book. =The \\"Muthesius Affair\\" and the Deutscher Werkbund= By this time Muthesius was widely recognised as an admirer of English culture, but this also laid him open to accusations of divided loyalties. In 1907 he was accused by the Fachverband f√ºr die wirtschaftlichen Interessen des Kunstgewerbes (\\"Trade Association for the Economic Interests of the Arts and Crafts\\") of criticising the quality of German industrial products in a lecture in Berlin. The resulting controversy saw several influential designers and industrialists withdraw from the association and set up the Deutscher Werkbund (\\"German Association of Craftsmen\\"), explicitly aimed at bringing the highest standards of design to mass-produced output. The Deutscher Werkbund was a major influence on the early careers of Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, but although Muthesius was in many ways its spiritual father and served as its chairman from 1910 until 1916, he had little sympathy with the emerging early-modernism, considering both Art Nouveau and the later designs of the Bauhaus to be just as much superficial styles as those of the nineteenth century. Muthesius was one of the major architects who built Germany's first Garden City, Hellerau, a suburb of Dresden, founded in 1909. Its foundation was closely related with the activities of the Deutscher Werkbund, too. Among the many employees of Muthesius was the German Socialist city planner Martin Wagner, who applied the lessons of the garden city to Berlin on a huge scale, from 1924 to about 1932. Later career Muthesius continued designing houses and writing about domestic architecture until 1927, when he died in a road accident after a site visit in Berlin.

He was the fifth child and fourth son of Sir James Paget (1814‚Äì1899). Paget was a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital and obtained the F.R.C.S. in 1885.

That is a day which all physicians and surgeons -- and not they alone -- ought to mark on their calendars; and it falls this year with special significance to us, now that his country and ours are fighting side by side to bring back the world's peace.\\" =Vivisection= After his retirement from medical practice in 1910, Paget devoted much time to justifying vivisection.Bates, A. W. H. (2017). Anti-Vivisection and the Profession of Medicine in Britain: A Social History. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 135. He was secretary of the Research Defence Society. He authored The Case Against Anti-Vivisection in 1904 and was the editor of For and Against Experiments on Animals, 1912. Paget was heavily criticized by anti- vivisectionists. In 1962, Archibald Hill noted that \\"Stephen Paget's death indeed was claimed by anti-vivisectionists as a direct consequence of their prayers.\\"Hill, Archibald. (1962). The Ethical Dilemma of Science and Other Writings. The Scientific Book Guild. p. 112 =Criticism of Christian Science= In 1909, Paget authored a book, The Faith and Works of Christian Science which exposed the fallacies, inconsistencies, and dangers of Christian Science.

It has no surface outlets, so by some definitions, it is endorheic; however, it probably drains by underground channels into the Baraboo River.Arthur C. Trowbridge, \\"The History of Devils Lake, Wisconsin\\", The Journal of Geology 25:4:344-372 (May-June 1917) The lake is one of the primary attractions of Devil's Lake State Park. It is also a popular recreation destination for watercraft, fishing, hiking, and climbing. Name Devil's Lake was so named because it is situated in a deep chasm with no visible inlet or outlet. The term, devil's lake is a misinterpretation of the Ho-Chunk name Tawacunchukdah or Da-wa-kah- char-gra, which better translates to \\"Sacred Lake\\" or \\"Spirit Lake.\\" Spirit Lake is highly significant in Ho-Chunk oral history, and voices of spirits were often heard during the celebrations. History The terminal moraine stretching across the former river gorge in Devil's Lake State Park View of the Northern shore of Devil's Lake Devil's Lake was originally a gorge of the Wisconsin River prior to the last ice age. At what is now the southern end of the lake, the river turned from a southerly direction to an easterly direction. During the ice age, a lobe of the glacier passed to the east of the Baraboo Hills and came up the river valley. It deposited materials and then melted, leaving a terminal moraine blocking the river, forming an earthen dam.A Geologic Tour of the Baraboo Ranges and Devil's Lake Gorge Another moraine was deposited at the north end of the lake. The river eventually found a new course to the east of the Baraboo Hills, where the glacier had been, leaving a portion of the river gorge between the moraines filled with water. This body of water is Devil's Lake.

Henry Gerhard Appenzeller (February 6, 1858 ‚Äì June 11, 1902) was a Methodist missionary. He and four other missionaries, including Horace N. Allen, Horace G. Underwood, William B. Scranton, and Mary F. Scranton introduced Protestant Christianity to Korea from 1885 to 1902. He was known for his three major contributions to Korea: the Paichai College Hall, the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Seoul, and the translated New Testament. Background and early life Henry Gerhard Appenzeller was born in Souderton, Pennsylvania, in 1858. His mother was Swiss Mennonite, while his father was from Pennsylvania. His parents went to the German Reformed Church. His mother played an important role in his life. She influenced the faith of Henry and his two brothers by reading the German Bible on Sunday afternoons with them. His mother spoke German but little English, therefore, German was Henry's first language. He grew up speaking Pennsylvania German in his home. His fluency in both written and spoken German later allowed him to communicate easily with Germans in America, Europe, and Korea. Henry was transformed due to a personal spiritual experience on October 6, 1876. He celebrated this day as his spiritual birthday every year. He studied at Franklin and Marshall College, a private residential liberal arts college based on the Reformed Church, where he studied ancient languages and held a particular interest in Greek language and literature. Henry also studied and became fluent in biblical languages and French. He joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lancaster at the age of twenty- one, three years after his conversion. Then he served in the church as a Methodist preacher. After that, he attended Drew Theological Seminary, a theological school. During his studies at Drew Theological Seminary, he joined the overseas missionary service. Before Appenzeller sailed to Korea, he married Ella Dodge. They had three children together. Their daughter Alice Rebecca Appenzeller was the first American born in Korea. Work in Korea Henry Appenzeller and His Students Appenzeller arrived in Korea on April 5, 1885, an Easter Sunday morning, with his wife Ella Appenzeller. During that period, Seoul was in political struggle. Missionaries could not set up a church, nor preach in public. Evangelism had to be done secretly. Appenzeller focused on preparing a missionary residence in the first two years. In 1887, worship in public became possible, therefore, a chapel was established for services. His goal was to transform Pagan Korea into Christian Korea. Appenzeller was the founder of a boy's school, Paichai Hakdang--Hall for the Rearing of Useful Men in Korea in 1887. It is the predecessor of Pai Chai University and Paichai Middle & High school. He spread the Gospel, introduced Western culture, and trained the students in the Methodist faith. He was one of the founder of the first Korean Methodist Church in Seoul, Chong Dong. and he also established many Protestant institutions. He served at Chong Dong as a pastor in 1887 until his death in 1902. In 1886, Appenzeller was on the Board of Bible Translators with the other Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries and other Korean translators. He helped to translate the Bible into Korean. Cenotaph at Yanghwajin Foreign Missionary Cemetery Death In 1902, at the age of 44, Appenzeller was traveling to a southern port city, Mokpo, to attend a meeting for the Bible translation. While at sea he drowned trying to save a Korean girl. A cenotaph in his honor was erected at the Yanghwajin Foreigners' Cemetery, the gravesite of over 300 foreigners including over 80 missionaries from many denominations including those sent by the United Methodist Church, and its predecessor denominations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Legacy Since its founding in the 19th century, the Korean Methodist Church has dramatically developed as one of major Protestant denominations in Korea. In 2001, the denomination comprised 5,262 churches, 1,394,514 members, and 7,298 ministers. There were six universities established under the Methodist model, including Pai Chai. In addition, the denomination had its own theological seminary, the Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul. It also had six theological institutes and 54 junior high and high schools. Rev. Dr. Sehyoung Lee, Dean Javier Viera, Bishop John Schol, Rev. Ki-Sung Song, Arist Changgon Kim, and other dignitaries celebrate the installation of a bronze bust of Appenzeller at Drew Theological School. On October 21, 2016, a bronze bust of Appenzeller was dedicated on the campus of Drew Theological School as a gift from the Chungdong First Methodist Church in Seoul, South Korea. Rev. Dr. Sehyoung Lee, the English Ministry Pastor of Chungdong, said: \\"For the people of Chungdong and Methodists in Korea, it‚Äôs as if Appenzeller came to Korea, gave himself up, and now 130 years later, we‚Äôre expressing our deep gratitude by bringing him back.\\" See also * Christianity in Korea * 19th-century Protestant missions in China * List of Protestant missionaries in China References * Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896.

Description  Leaves and mature cones It is a large deciduous coniferous tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to diameter. The largest known western larch is tall and in circumference with a crown, located at Seeley Lake, Montana. The crown is narrow conic; the main branches are level to upswept, with the side branches often drooping. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light green, long, and very slender; they turn bright yellow in the fall, leaving the pale orange-brown shoots bare until the next spring. The seed cones are ovoid-cylindric, long, with 40 to 80 seed scales; each scale bearing an exserted bract. The cones are reddish purple when immature, turning brown and the scales opening flat or reflexed to release the seeds when mature, four to six months after pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning dull gray-black. Young cones It grows at elevations between , and is very cold tolerant, able to survive winter temperatures down to about . It only grows on well-drained soils, unable to thrive on waterlogged ground. The seeds are an important food for some birds, notably pine siskin, redpoll, and Two-barred crossbill. In autumn, the foliage frequently turns yellow before it falls off. Uses Some Plateau Indian tribes drank an infusion from the young shoots to treat tuberculosis and laryngitis. The wood is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and is particularly valued for yacht building; wood used for this must be free of knots, and can only be obtained from old trees that were pruned when young to remove side branches. Small larch poles are widely used for rustic fencing. Western larch is used for the production of Venice turpentine. Larix occidentalis The wood is highly prized as firewood in the Pacific Northwest where it is often called \\"tamarack,\\" although it is a different species than the tamarack larch. The wood burns with a sweet fragrance and a distinctive popping noise. Indigenous peoples used to chew gum produced from the tree as well as eat the cambium and sap.Turner, Nancy J.

Christina Sverresdatter (Norwegian: Kristin Sverresdatter; died 1213) was a medieval Norwegian princess and titular queen consort, spouse of co-regent Philip Simonsson, the Bagler party pretender to the throne of Norway.Knut Helle Kristin Sverresdatter Store norske leksikon. Retrieved May 20, 2016 Biography Christina was the daughter of King Sverre Sigurdsson of Norway and his queen consort, Margaret of Sweden. Her father died in 1202 and her mother returned to Sweden, forced to leave Christina behind. In 1209, she married Norwegian aristocrat Philip Simonsson. She died in labour giving birth to their first child, a son, who also died soon after. Her marriage was arranged as a part of reconciliation between the Bagler and Birkebeiner factions during the period of the Civil war era in Norway. In 1208, with no side looking able to achieve victory, Bishop Nikolas Arnesson together with other bishops of the Church, brokered a peace deal between the Baglers and the Birkebeiners. At the settlement of Kvits√∏y, the Birkebeiner candidate for king, Inge II of Norway, recognized Philip's rule over the eastern third of the country in return for Philip giving up any claim to the title of king and recognizing King Inge as his overlord. To seal the agreement, Philip was to marry King Sverre's daughter, Christina. Historic context In Norwegian civil war era it was usual that several royal sons fought against each other over power in Norway. The civil war period of Norwegian history lasted from 1130 to 1240. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between Church and King. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party.

Bad Azz Music Syndicate Bad Azz Music Syndicate is a record label founded by Boosie Badazz and Taquari \\"TQ\\" Hatch. While Incarcerated, TQ suggested rebranding Bad Azz Entertainment due to the many invalid artist and associates that began repping \\"Bad Azz Ent\\" unbeknownst to Boosie. TQ felt there would be a need to reestablish the brand as a music company that would be able to sign artist in the future who were more diverse and even international. Legal issues On October 22, 2008, Boosie was arrested after East Baton Rouge sheriff's deputies found marijuana and a glock in his car. Boosie pled guilty to his third-offense possession of marijuana charge on September 22, 2009 and was sentenced to two years in prison the next day. Judge James Moore doubled the sentence on November 10 after finding Boosie had violated probation while awaiting sentencing. Between his plea and sentencing, Boosie was electronically monitored and placed under house arrest. On June 17, 2010, Boosie was indicted on federal charges on first-degree murder of Terry Boyd. He also faced charges for three counts of possession with intent to distribute narcotics (Schedule II: codeine and cocaine; Schedule I: marijuana), three counts of \\"conspiracy to commit possession with intent to distribute narcotics\\", and two counts of \\"conspiracy to introduce contraband into a penal institution\\". He has stated that he is innocent of these charges. District Attorney Hillar Moore stated that the killing seemed to be \\"over turf\\". If convicted, Boosie could have faced the death penalty. Prosecutors also stated that they believed the rapper may have been involved in at least five other murders. On June 28, Boosie entered a not-guilty plea in a Louisiana court room. While Boosie's defense addressed the fact that the rapper has several ongoing cases, they emphasized that he is not a murderer. On November 29, 2011, Boosie was sentenced to eight years in state prison after pleading guilty to the drug charges. On May 11, 2012, a jury found Boosie not guilty of first degree murder. On December 7, 2012, his attorneys were able to argue that the drug ring charge was a set up: the informant offered to provide codeine syrup for Boosie, an admitted codeine addict, in exchange for his help. He was released on March 5, 2014. He remained on parole until 2018. Personal life = Children and relationships = Boosie has eight children by six women. He has said that he did not believe marriage was a good choice for him, because he didn't want to lose half of his fortune to his spouse in the event that he committed adultery, and has praised women who stay in a relationship with an unfaithful partner, saying he respects those women. In 2010, one of his ex-girlfriends, Walnita \\"Nita\\" Decuir, was arrested on charges related to drug distribution for attempting to smuggle illicit substances to Boosie, reportedly marijuana, codeine, and MDMA, who, at the time, was incarcerated. = Health = Shortly after Bad Azz was released, Boosie revealed that he had type 1 diabetes, having been diagnosed in childhood. In April 2020, he took to Instagram to ask the public for help in locating insulin glargine, also known as Lantus, asking followers in the Jacksonville area to call him. On November 25, 2015, Boosie revealed he had been diagnosed with kidney cancer. He had successful surgery to remove the cancer. = Controversies = In February 2020, Boosie was criticized for comments he made towards Zaya Wade, 12-year-old daughter of American basketball player Dwyane Wade, who had recently come out as transgender, with the support of her parents, among them being \\"Don't cut his dick off, bruh.\\" A subsequent video of Boosie he made to clarify his previous comments did little to alleviate the backlash, as he was seemingly under the impression that minors are able to undergo sex reassignment surgery and that such surgery involved penectomy and confused being gay with being transgender. In the same video, he went onto complain that children had too much power, and about corporal punishment being illegal. Also in February 2020, just days after the incident involving Zaya Wade, Boosie was asked by staff to leave a Planet Fitness in Georgia; Boosie alleged the gym's manager was hostile towards him for his comments towards Wade but a spokesperson for the company denied Boosie's claim that a personal grudge was the reason for his being asked to leave, instead stating that the rapper had failed to comply with company policies and had harassed members of the staff. In May 2020, Boosie came under fire for a now-deleted video he'd uploaded to Instagram in which he spoke positively of paying an adult woman to perform oral sex on his son and nephew, then 12 and 13 years old, below the age of consent in any U.S. state, and allowing his minor son to watch pornography, as he felt pornography was more appropriate for children to watch than \\"cartoons with two men kissing.\\" In 2017, in a birthday post aimed at his soon-to-be 14-year-old son, Boosie bragged that he had secured his son a \\"bad bitch\\" to perform fellatio on him for his birthday, in a post liked by 27,000 users, though he later claimed he'd been joking, after public backlash occurred. = Education = On March 9, 2013 it was announced that Boosie had earned his GED certificate while incarcerated.

He wore uniform number 24 in the NL, but when MLB merged the AL and NL umpiring staffs in 2000, Layne was forced to switch to number 26, as AL umpire Al Clark, who wore 24 in the junior circuit, had more seniority. When Clark was fired midway through the 2001 season by MLB, Layne reclaimed number 24 and has worn it ever since. Umpiring career In October 2005, he umpired in his first World Series. He was also the home plate umpire when Barry Bonds hit his record 71st home run in , and for the no-hitter pitched by Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 29, 1990 at Dodger Stadium. Layne was chosen as one of the umpires for the one-game Wild Card playoff between the Baltimore Orioles and the Texas Rangers on October 5, 2012.Umpires for Wild Card Games, Division Series announced Darling, Kellogg Will Serve As Crew Chiefs for Wild Card Games; Davis, DeMuth, Gorman and West Assigned to Lead Division Series Crews. MLB.com. Retrieved October 5, 2012. In 2014, he was chosen as one of the three MLB umpire representatives for the Japan All-Star Series. =Injuries= On August 18, 2006, Layne was the plate umpire for a game between the Atlanta Braves and the Florida Marlins. In the 8th inning, he was struck by the barrel of a broken bat swung by the Marlins' Hanley Ram√≠rez. Layne's injury delayed the game for 13 minutes, and he was carted off the field. X-rays were negative and Layne escaped serious injury, suffering only a bruised jaw. On June 7, 2008, Layne was the plate umpire where he sustained a mild concussion when he was hit by a foul ball in the top of the third inning of a game between the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals. While serving as the plate umpire during a June 2012 game between the Minnesota Twins and the Cincinnati Reds, Layne was struck in the side of the head by a piece of Devin Mesoraco's broken bat. Layne would leave the game, being replaced behind the plate by Bob Davidson.Ump Jerry Layne hit in head by bat USAToday.com. Retrieved 6 July 2012 On April 19, 2016, Layne injured his right leg after jumping and landing awkwardly while attempting to avoid being hit by a batted ball. During the 2016 season, Layne was forced to leave three different games early while umpiring home plate, due to being struck in the head by foul balls or errant pitches. On April 19, 2018, Layne was the home plate umpire between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Angels. He exited the game in the bottom of the first inning after a foul ball by Mike Trout hit him in his right arm near his elbow and biceps. =Controversy= On June 17, 1997, Layne ejected Cincinnati Reds manager Ray Knight for arguing after Layne ruled that Cincinnati's Deion Sanders was out at third base. After he was thrown out, Knight kicked dirt on the base and then picked it up and hurled it to the ground. In August 2003, Layne ejected Kansas City Royals catcher Mike DiFelice after Layne ruled that Minnesota Twin Torii Hunter was safe in a play at the plate. Following his ejection, DiFelice threw a glove into the crowd and also tossed a pair of water coolers as well as a trash can out of the dugout. On October 19, 2011, Layne was the plate umpire when Adri√°n Beltr√© nicked a ball off of his foot to St. Louis Cardinals third basemen David Freese in Game 1 of the 2011 World Series, which, by rule, is a dead ball. Layne ruled that Beltre was not touched by the ball and play continued, despite Beltre hopping around home plate as if in pain. Infrared replays showed that the ball appeared to have narrowly clipped Beltre's foot and that the ball should have been called foul or dead by virtue of batter's interference. Layne inspected the ball after Rangers manager Ron Washington argued the call; however Layne did not see any scuff from Beltre's shoe and upheld his original call. On October 28, 2011, Layne was the plate umpire for Game 7 of the 2011 World Series, as the St. Louis Cardinals hosted the Texas Rangers. During this contest, baseball's computerized Pitch f/x system indicated Layne missed 17 ball/strike calls, with 14 of these calls benefiting the Cardinals and three benefiting the Rangers. Most notably, with St. Louis leading 3-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning, the Cardinals loaded the bases as Yadier Molina stepped to the plate with two outs. Molina took a 3-2 fastball from Scott Feldman for a called fourth ball, allowing a run to score as opposed to ending the inning had the pitch been called a strike. Pitch f/x indicates the pitch was located within the strike zone.http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/3936/zoneplotphppitchselallg.gif On April 30, 2017, Layne was the crew chief when the Arizona Diamondbacks hosted the Colorado Rockies. In the bottom of the tenth inning with no score, the Diamondbacks had A.J. Pollock on first base as the potential winning run with one out. David Peralta hit a ground ball to Rockies second baseman D.J. LeMahieu, and LeMahieu ran into Pollock (intentionally, as replays later showed), who was about five feet from the ball. Pollock ended up at third base, with Peralta at first. Second base umpire Toby Basner (the umpire closest to the play) initially made no call, which meant no interference. After the play, Jerry Layne brought the umpires together, and after a brief discussion, Jerry Layne overturned the no interference call and called Pollock out, even though the no interference call was the correct call. However, the Diamondbacks were not hindered by this call, as they won the game in thirteen innings.

Its eleven council members are appointed by the Governor and the state Legislature. The agency's mission is to advance California through the arts and creativity. History The California Arts Council was established in 1976 and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, who dissolved the existing 15-member California Arts Commission, which had been in existence since 1963. Purpose of state arts agencies When Congress created the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 1965, it required the NEA to apportion funds to any state that established an arts agency. State arts agencies increase public access to the arts and work to ensure that every community in America enjoys the cultural, civic, economic and educational benefits of a thriving arts sector. To do this, according to the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, state arts agencies: * provide grant funding for artists, arts institutions, schools and community groups, * offer training and information that strengthens the management and entrepreneurial skills of artists and arts organizations, * support in- and out-of-school arts activities for young people, * lead initiatives to foster economic and civic development through the arts, * advance arts education through teacher training, curriculum development and assessment projects, * conduct research that documents the impact of the arts, * educate the public about the role of the arts in American life, * preserve and celebrate the cultural traditions of each state, * recognize and promote artistic achievement. All 50 states and the six U.S. jurisdictions (American Samoa, District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have state arts agencies. The NEA is required by law to allocate 40% of its grant funds to states and regions. State arts agencies, including the California Arts Council, use these dollars to leverage matching funds, to address local needs, and to expand the reach and impact of federal arts funding across the country. Budget Although the structure of state arts agencies anticipated that the bulk of their funding would come from annual or biennial appropriations from state legislatures, in California that has not always been the case. Funding of the California Arts Council has followed the general fiscal trends in the state. The California Arts Council‚Äôs biggest budget was $32 million in 2000-01.Mike Boehm (July 16, 2013), Arts backers hail Perez' $2-million budget gift, but aim for more Los Angeles Times. During the fiscal crisis of 2003-2004, the California Arts Council lost 94% of its funding from the state legislature, resulting in deep cuts to arts council programs and staff. California currently ranks 37th in state arts funding per capita, spending 46 cents for each California resident in support of the arts.State Arts Agency Revenues, Fiscal Year 2018, National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, https://nasaa- arts.org/nasaa_research/fy2018-state-arts-agency-revenues-report/. However, the California Arts Council receives revenue from two income streams that are not dependent on allocation of tax dollars: the Arts License Plate and voluntary contributions, both of which the Franchise Tax Board deems tax- deductible as charitable contributions to the California Arts Council. For the 2017-18 fiscal year, the Arts Council received a permanent budget increase of $6.8 million permanent increase, a $750,000 ongoing allocation to directly support increased arts programming for youth engaged in California's juvenile justice system, as well as an additional $2 million increased allocation for California's Arts in Corrections program. Arts license plate In 1994, through special legislation, the California Arts Council and the California Department of Motor Vehicles began offering the first license plate in the United States to directly benefit the arts. The image on the plate, Coastline, was created by California artist Wayne Thiebaud, who retains copyright to the image but gifted its use to the California Arts Council for the production of the Arts License Plate. The license plate is available to California car owners, supports arts education and local arts programming. Voluntary tax contribution (Keep Arts in Schools Fund) In 2010, the legislature passed SB 1076 by Senator Curren Price, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed it into law. The California Arts Council was included on the 2010 and 2011 \\"Voluntary Contribution\\" portion of the state tax form. By choosing \\"Arts Council Fund\\" and indicating the amount they wish to contribute, individual taxpayers were able to make tax-deductible contributions in amounts of $1 or more. This option was removed for 2012 because the Arts Council Fund did not achieve the $250,000 goal specified in the enabling legislation. In 2013 the legislature passed SB 571 introduced by Senator Curren D. Price, at that time Chair of the Joint Committee on the Arts. Authorship was assumed by Senator Carol Liu when Senator Price was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in early 2013. Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law in September 2013. The bill returned the California Arts Council to the voluntary contribution portion of California tax return forms through the \\"Keep Arts in Schools Fund,\\" which first appeared on California tax returns in 2014. During the California Arts Council's 2016-2017 fiscal year, the Keep Arts in Schools Fund brought in $250,000. The California Arts Council today Arts Council members and staff come from many walks of life and have experience in the arts, creative industries, arts education, community development, state and local government, and the nonprofit and for-profit sectors of California's economy. As a state agency, the California Arts Council encourages public participation in the arts in the state, helps build arts organizations at the local level, assists with the professional development of arts leaders, promotes awareness of the value of the arts, and directly funds arts programs for California citizens. The California Arts Council assists in locating artists and artists' estates that are due monies under California's Resale Royalty Act (California Civil Code Section 986), and distributes these royalties when artists are found. The Resale Royalty Act was declared unconstitutional in 2012. On July 6, 2018, a panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled that California‚Äôs Resale Royalties Act only applies to art sales conducted prior to 1978.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission is a public agency devoted to supporting, promoting and advancing the arts in the region. The mission of the Arts Commission is 'ADVANCING COMMUNITY THROUGH ARTS AND CULTURE'. Funded by the City and County of Sacramento, the Arts Commission provides funding to local artists and arts groups; promotes the arts through marketing, outreach and education initiatives; provides resources to support and increase regional arts education activities; and serves as a community partner and resource. The Arts Commission is guided by 11 Commissioners, appointed by the Sacramento City Council, and the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors. As a local arts agency, the Arts Commission is committed to uplifting the cultural quality of life for the Sacramento region. Through community facilitation and planning, the Commission provides leadership in arts and economic revitalization; neighborhood and educational enhancement; regional cultural tourism and marketing; and in organizational and financial arts stabilization. The Arts Commission‚Äôs programs include Art in Public Places, Grants and Cultural Programs, Arts Education and Arts Marketing and Outreach. Art in Public Places The City of Sacramento‚Äôs nationally renowned Art in Public Places (APP) program was established in 1977 to expand public experiences of visual art by installing artworks in public spaces. It includes a collection of more than 400 permanently sited works of art integrated into Sacramento‚Äôs built and natural environments. More than 80% of these artworks are by local and regional artists. The Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission manages Sacramento‚Äôs Public Art Program which is funded through City and County ordinances and a Memorandum of Understanding that specifies 2% of eligible City and County capital improvement project budgets be set aside for the commission, purchase, and installation of artworks throughout the City. The Art in Public Places Committee, a sub-committee of the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission, oversees the development of a public art master plan, long range planning, policy and procedures and reviews and approves artist selection and projects. The program has grown to include exhibition spaces, featuring ongoing installations of regional artists at Sacramento City Hall and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). An Education Program was established in 2008 and includes guided tours, workshops, lectures, discussions, and other educational opportunities for design professionals, public art practitioners and the general public. The goal of the Art in Public Places program is to integrate art and the ideas of artists into the fabric of the City. The collection includes permanent and temporary artworks as well as art that is integrated into the design of buildings and landscapes. Some of the artworks are interactive, some static, some made with traditional or non traditional media like paint, wood, steel, glass, and clay or sound, light, video and film. There are artworks in the collection that are functional, like a bench or tree grate, some address a political or social concern. There are works that are monumental and others are meant to be experienced more intimately, and many will simply take you by surprise. As a whole, the ever- changing APP collection is meant to: * Contribute to building and sustaining the unique cultural heritage and identity of Sacramento * Encourage community dialogue and interaction * Provide unique educational opportunities * Influence the way we think of others and ourselves * Inspire, celebrate, and help us remember * Create a more beautiful built and natural environment * Encourage economic development and vitality by providing business opportunities and by making Sacramento a better place to live View the artworks that are part of this incredible collection on the APP Collection Directory.

Grants and Cultural Programs Artists, arts groups and arts and cultural organizations are offered a variety of resources and grant opportunities to encourage their growth and to broaden their offerings to the Sacramento arts communities. Because the Arts Commission re-grants public dollars, programs are always open to any and all artists and arts groups that wish to apply for a grant with us. Each application is treated with the same transparent professionalism that exists in all Arts Commission processes. Funding decisions are not made by staff. Staff enforce equal access and inclusiveness as they facilitate the evaluation process through peer review panels. Applicants have to spend time writing their applications, answering questions, and providing information that may seem redundant and can be hard to put together. All of this keeps the Arts Commission highly accountable to the public. The Arts Commission offers grant programs targeted at Sacramento County nonprofit arts and cultural organizations, artists, and arts groups. Arts Stabilization Program The Arts Commission offers this program in an effort to provide resources, support, and technical assistance to Sacramento County arts and cultural organizations, artists, and arts groups. The Arts Stabilization Program began in 1998 in an effort to strengthen the arts community and specifically nonprofit arts organizations. In 2007 some Arts Stabilization programs were expanded to include small arts groups and individual artists. This program provides resources, support, and technical assistance to Sacramento County arts and cultural organizations, artists and arts groups in marketing, business and financial planning, board and staff development and professional development. Sacramento Poet Laureate Program The Sacramento Poet Laureate Program was established in February 2000, and is designed to extend and bring to life the power and beauty of poetry and the spoken word to our community and to increase literary awareness in Sacramento County. The Sacramento Poet Laureate Program strives to encourage literary awareness by the general public and celebrates the high caliber of talent among Sacramento‚Äôs poets.

The Arts Education Program also manages an Arts Education Resource Directory, which is a searchable database of visual and performing artists and their arts education programs. The Directory lists workshops, residencies, performances, and field trips for all ages with contact information for booking the artists. All the teaching artists listed in the Directory have been screened for their experience and skills by the Arts Commission through a panel of regional working and teaching artists. You will see on their listings that they have been approved for either K-12 Arts or Community Arts, or both. Arts Marketing and Outreach Making Sacramento a Dynamic Cultural Destination The Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission sponsors cultural tourism and arts marketing initiatives designed to engage residents and visitors in the rich and vibrant arts community of Sacramento. This is accomplished through marketing and public service advertising campaigns, cultivating business and media relationships which broaden access to the arts and by establishing a program through which individual artists are honored for their lifelong achievements, arts organizations for special accomplishments and arts advocates for their efforts on behalf of the arts community.

It is one of many unrelated edible bivalves that in the United States are frequently referred to simply as clams, as in the expression \\"clam digging\\". Older literature sources may use the systematic name Venus mercenaria; this species is in the family Veneridae, the venus clams. Confusingly, the \\"ocean quahog\\" is a different species, Arctica islandica, which, although superficially similar in shape, is in a different family of bivalves: it is rounder than the hard clam, usually has black periostracum, and there is no pallial sinus in the interior of the shell. Alternative names Left valve interior of Mercenaria mercenaria. The hard clam has many alternative common names. It is also known as the Northern quahog, round clam, or chowder clam.Harte, M. E. 2001. \\"Systematics and taxonomy, Chapter 1\\", pp. 3‚Äì51, in Kraeuter, J. N. and M. Castagna (eds.) \\"Biology of the Hard Clam\\", Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science, Vol. 31. Elsevier Science B.V.: New York. In fish markets, there are specialist names for different sizes of this species of clam. The smallest legally harvestable clams are called countnecks or peanuts, next size up are littlenecks, then topnecks. Above that are the cherrystones, and the largest are called quahogs or chowder clams.Rice, M.A. (1992). The Northern Quahog: Biology of Mercenaria mercenaria. Rhode Island Sea Grant Publication No. RIU-B-92-001, University of Rhode Island, Narragansett. 60 pp. web link. The most distinctive of these names is quahog ( , , or ). The word comes from the Narragansett word \\"poquauhock\\", which is similar in Wampanoag and some other Algonquian languages; it is first attested in North American English in 1794.\\"Quahaug, quahog\\", in Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973)Roger Williams, A Key Into the Language of America. London: Gregory Dexter, 1643. New England tribes made valuable beads called wampum from the shells, especially those colored purple; the species name mercenaria is related to the Latin word for commerce. Today people living in coastal New England still use the Native American word for the clam as they have done for hundreds of years. In many areas where aquaculture is important, clam farmers have bred specialized versions of these clams with distinctions needed for them to be distinguished in the marketplace. These are quite similar to common \\"wild type\\" Mercenaria clams, except that their shells bear distinctive markings. These are known as the notata strain of quahogs, which occur naturally in low numbers wherever quahogs are found.Eldridge, P.J., W. Waltz, and H. Mills. 1975. Relative abundance of Mercenaria mercenaria notata in estuaries of South Carolina. Veliger 18:396-397. Distribution bored (producing Entobia) and encrusted after the death of the clam Hard clams are quite common throughout New England, north into Canada, and all down the Eastern seaboard of the United States to Florida; but they are particularly abundant between Cape Cod and New Jersey, where seeding and harvesting them is an important commercial form of aquaculture. For example, the species is an important member of the suspension-feeding, benthic fauna of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Rhode Island is situated right in the middle of \\"quahog country\\" and has supplied a quarter of the U.S.'s total annual commercial quahog catch. The quahog is the official shellfish of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. The species has also been introduced and is farmed on the Pacific coast of North America and in Great Britain and continental Europe. It reproduces sexually by females and males shedding gametes into the water. Parasite Quahog parasite unknown (QPX) is a parasite that affects the hard shell clam Mercenaria mercenaria. While little is known about the disease, research is currently under way in several laboratories. This research is fueled by the need to inform aquaculturists, who suffer financially because of the mortality rates in clams that QPX inflicts and the ensuing years in which runs must be left fallow to clear the disease. It was discovered along the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts in 1995. Quahog parasite X (or quahog parasite unknown [QPX]) disease of the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria is caused by a poorly known protistan parasite. Its DNA sequence analysis places the QPX parasite among the thraustochytrid stramenopiles. Thraustochytrids are common protists in marine sediments and the water column, but only a few thraustochytrids are known as parasites of marine animals. Although QPX disease was first recorded on the Atlantic coast of Canada in the early 1960s, it did not become a major economic problem until its appearance in cultured clams at Prince Edward Island, Massachusetts in 1992, and Virginia in 1997. Infected clams are characterized by the presence of blisters or pustules in the mantle and later by gaping and death . Human use Steamed clams Raw top neck clams in New Jersey. In coastal areas of New England, New York, and New Jersey, restaurants known as raw bars or clam bars specialize in serving littlenecks and topnecks raw on an opened half-shell, usually with a cocktail sauce with horseradish, and often with lemon. Sometimes littlenecks are steamed and dipped in butter, though not as commonly as their soft-shelled clam cousin the \\"steamer\\". Littlenecks are often found in-the-shell in sauces, soups, stews, and clams casino, or substituted for European varieties such as the cockle in southern European seafood dishes. The largest clams are quahogs or chowders and cherrystones; they have the toughest meat and are used in such dishes as clam chowder, clam cakes, and stuffed clams, or are minced and mixed into dishes that use the smaller, more tender clams. Historically, American Indians used the quahog as a component in wampum, the shell beads exchanged in the North American fur trade. The Narragansetts used the hard clam for food and ornaments. A population of hard clams exists in Southampton Water in Hampshire, England. Originally bred in the warm water outflows at Southampton Power Station for use as eel bait, the population became self-sustaining and can now be found in Southampton Water and has also spread to Portsmouth Harbour and Langstone Harbour. Clams and red tide The term \\"red tide\\" refers to an accumulation of a toxin, such as saxitoxin, produced by marine algae. Filter-feeding shellfish are affected, such as clams, oysters, and mussels. The toxin affects the human central nervous system. Eating contaminated shellfish, raw or cooked, can be fatal. Some other kinds of algal blooms make the seawater appear red, but red tide blooms do not always discolor the water, nor are they related to tides.

He matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1877, and graduated in the Mathematics Tripos in 1881, receiving his MA in 1886. Taylor took Holy Orders on going down from Cambridge, being ordained Deacon at Rochester in 1881 and was made Priest there in 1883. After a few years (1883 ‚Äì c. 1896) in Queensland, Australia, he settled with his wife and family in Cornwall. He served as Vicar first at All Saints' Church, Falmouth, from 1890 and then at Redruth from 1892. In 1897 he accepted the rural living of St Breward. Taylor was an honorary Canon of Truro Cathedral from 1917 to 1938. In 1919 he went to serve at Gunwalloe. He was elected Proctor and held this office from 1919 to 1935. He also served as Rural Dean of Penwith from 1924 to 1927.

It is similar in appearance to Worcestershire sauce, but contains no anchovies. It is made of water, sugar and spirit vinegar with a selection of spices and colouring. It is gluten free, suitable for vegans and is approved by the Vegetarian Society. Henry Henderson began manufacturing sauce in the latter part of the 19th century. Originally manufactured at 35 Broad Lane in Sheffield, Henderson‚Äôs Relish is still being made and was in uninterrupted production within half a mile of the site from which the first bottle was filled until the move to a new food production factory in 2013. The company was bought by Shaws of Huddersfield in 1910 who still supply Hendersons with vinegar. In 1940 Charles Hinksman formed the present company of Hendersons (Sheffield) Ltd., the control of which has remained with the family. It is widely known in Sheffield as \\"Hendo's\\".  Ingredients  Like many similar sauces, Henderson's has a base of spirit vinegar, coloured with caramel and sweetened with sugar and saccharin. Its flavour is derived from tamarind, cayenne pepper and garlic oil. A spice that distinguishes Henderson's from other English sauces is its use of cloves. It is distinguished from other sauces, in that it does not use anchovies as an ingredient. Local following According to Hendersons, famous fans of the condiment include Sheffield-born celebrities Sean Bean, Def Leppard's Rick Savage, Millie Bright and the late Peter Stringfellow. Politician David Blunkett, also a Sheffield native, used it when he cooked shepherd's pie on chef Gordon Ramsay's The F Word TV cookery programme. In 1993, two special-edition labels were produced to celebrate the FA Cup semi- final. Sheffield's two league clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, both then in the Premier League, contested the match at Wembley. The bottles were produced with labels in both red and white stripes (United's colours) and blue and white stripes (Wednesday's colours). These labels are still available in the respective clubs' shops. The singer/songwriter Richard Hawley used specially-labelled bottles of Henderson's Relish to promote his 2005 album Coles Corner. On his 2007 autumn tour, special bottles of the relish were available to promote his then-current album Lady's Bridge. The Sheffield band The Everly Pregnant Brothers have a song called \\"Hendos\\", a pastiche of the Coldplay song \\"Yellow\\"from their album Exile on West Street and also name- check the product in their song \\"No Oven No Pie\\", a pastiche of \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" by Bob Marley and the Wailers.From the album Sheffield Calling The comedian Tom Wrigglesworth said of Henderson's Relish that while outsiders think the condiment is Sheffield's answer to Worcestershire sauce, Sheffielders think it is the answer to everything. Henderson's Relish has been an inspiration to several artists from Sheffield, such as Rick Savage (Def Leppard), who have produced pieces about the product. Pete McKee, Kid Acne and Jim Connolly have all released prints offering their own unique take on the relish. It also featured in the plotline of the second episode of Series 4 of BBC Radio 4's comedy series Tom Wrigglesworth's Hang-Ups in September 2016. A gold-label version was produced to commemorate Jessica Ennis winning the Heptathlon at the 2012 Olympics.Jessica Ennis commemorative bottle = Hendogate = Knowledge of Henderson's is so limited outside Yorkshire that Lewisham MP Jim Dowd misunderstood it as a copy of the anchovy-based Lea and Perrins and described it as \\"parasitic packaging\\" in an attempt to pass off one sauce as another, during a parliamentary debate on the Intellectual Property Bill. He had encountered the sauce at a pub in Blackheath, the Hare and Billet, also far outside the usual Henderson's region. Later, he was corrected by comments from Sheffield MPs Paul Blomfield and Nick Clegg. Dowd later toured the Henderson's factory in a peace-making gesture.  Factory  Henderson's (Sheffield) Ltd. After starting in Sheffield over one hundred years ago, until 2013 the relish was in uninterrupted production within half a mile of the original site on Broad Lane from which the first bottle was filled. The Henderson's factory was located opposite what was once Jessop's Hospital for Women, now the Music Department of the University of Sheffield. The building is adjacent to the University of Sheffield Supertram stop, on Leavygreave Road. In September 2008, the sign that had adorned the side of the historic Henderson's Relish building was stolen, and shortly afterwards was placed for sale on a local Sheffield blog.Something to relish ... missing half of sign for sale for 50p In 2013, the manufacturer moved to Sheffield Parkway Business Park.

Since 1997, the band has been \\"celebrating the Grateful Dead concert experience.\\" Overview Dark Star Orchestra performs shows from among the nearly 2,500 performances of the Grateful Dead during their 30-year tenure as fathers of improvisational rock. On most, though not all of their performances, Dark Star Orchestra presents the complete original set list, song by song, and in order, while adapting their phrasing, voice arrangements and specific musical equipment for the various eras of the Grateful Dead shows in which they perform. Members of the Grateful Dead themselves, including rhythm guitarist/singer Bob Weir, bassist Phil Lesh, drummer Bill Kreutzmann, vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux, and keyboardists Vince Welnick and Tom Constanten, have all appeared on stage and performed with Dark Star Orchestra. In November 2011, the group played its 2,000th show in Ithaca, New York. History Dark Star Orchestra has been playing live shows together since 1997, after guitarist John Kadlecik contacted keyboardist Scott Larned with a concept (introduced by a common friend Andrew \\"Tiny\\" Dofner): performing complete Grateful Dead shows out of history. When Scott mentioned having the same idea, John knew they were on to something. Since forming, the band has performed over 2,500 shows. On lead guitar and vocals, John Kadlecik used amp rigs and equipment to imitate guitar tone of Jerry Garcia from the show being recreated. When a 70s show is being performed, vocalist Lisa Mackey provides Donna Godchaux's female harmonies. Dino English delivers the rhythmic drumming sounds of Bill Kreutzmann. On the other drum set, Rob Koritz, fills the Mickey Hart role. Kevin Rosen provides a style of bass playing similar to that of Phil Lesh. Rob Eaton performs rhythm guitar and vocals in the style of Bob Weir. In November 1998, on the eve of their first anniversary, Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman of Phish joined DSO at Martyrs' after their own show. Fishman sat in for the majority of the evening, which included a drum section with four percussionists. The ensuing buzz caused national interest in the band. That winter, their Colorado tour sold out almost every stop, and, soon after, the Washington Post declared them \\"the hottest Grateful Dead tribute act going\\"; USA Today claimed DSO was \\"channeling the Dead\\", but what they do is not just a tribute to the Grateful Dead but a testament to the enormous number of unique set lists they performed in their long career. Continuing the growth, the band had performed up to 200 dates in a year. They have grown continually, playing at larger venues and theaters, collaborating with guests including Grateful Dead alumni Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, Donna Jean Godchaux-Mackay, Vince Welnick, and Tom Constanten. On 29 October 2004, Dark Star Orchestra performed their 1,000th show at Carolina Theatre in Greensboro, N.C. The show did not adhere to a particular Grateful Dead setlist but was instead composed of highlights from throughout the Grateful Dead's history. The show was recorded by the DSO crew and distributed as a 3-CD set. In 2008, Dark Star Orchestra performed over 150 shows throughout the U.S. In addition to the complete Grateful Dead show selections, the band has been known to incorporate Jerry Garcia Band show setlists as well as original set lists of their own choosing. During the band's Spring tour in 2005, co-founder Scott Larned died of a heart attack on April 24; the band reeled for a while, featuring the talents of guest keyboardists, including Dan Klepinger and Tom Ryan, until selecting Rob Barraco as a permanent replacement in 2007. In 2009 John Kadlecik joined a new band with original Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir called Furthur. On November 16, 2009 he officially announced that he was leaving Dark Star Orchestra. His final show with the band was on December 5, 2009. For DSO's 2009‚Äì10 winter shows, he was replaced by guitarist Jeff Mattson of the Zen Tricksters and the Donna Jean Godchaux Band. Mattson now is considered the permanent guitarist for DSO. On May 3, 2013 it was announced that bassist Kevin Rosen would be leaving the band. He was quoted as saying \\"After all my years of touring with Dark Star Orchestra, I find myself in need of an extended break from life on the road. In addition, my mother‚Äôs declining health makes it even more important to be home at this time.\\" Members Dark Star Orchestra performing at The Westcott Theater in Syracuse, New York, on December 1, 2014 =Current members= *Lisa Mackey ‚Äì vocals (1997‚Äìpresent) *Rob Koritz ‚Äì drums, percussion (1999‚Äìpresent) *Dino English ‚Äì drums, percussion (1999‚Äìpresent) *Rob Eaton ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (2001‚Äìpresent) *Rob Barraco ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (some shows in 2005 and 2006, 2007‚Äìpresent) *Jeff Mattson ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals (one show in 2005, 2009‚Äì2010, 2010‚Äìpresent) *Skip Vangelas ‚Äì bass, vocals (some shows in 2001, 2013‚Äìpresent) =Former Members= *Kevin Rosen ‚Äì bass, vocals (1997-1998, 2000-2013) *John Kadlecik ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals (1997‚Äì2009) *Scott Larned ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (1997‚Äì2005, deceased) *Mike Maraat ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (1997‚Äì1999) *David Strome ‚Äì cowbell (1999) *Steve Gambuzza ‚Äì theremin (2000) *Ahmer Nizam ‚Äì drums (1997‚Äì1999) *Michael Hazdra ‚Äì bass, vocals (1998‚Äì2000, some shows in 2001) *Mark Corsolini ‚Äì drums (1998‚Äì1999) *Dave \\"Chopper\\" Campbell ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (some shows in 2000) *John Sabal ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (some shows in 2000) *Bustar ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (some shows in 2000) *Jim Harris ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (some shows in 2000 and 2001) *David Berg ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (some shows in 2000 and 2001) *Gregg Koerner ‚Äì bass, vocals (some shows in 2001) *Tom Ryan ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (some shows in 2005) *Dan Klepinger ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (some shows in 2005, 2006 and 2007) *Stu Allen ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals (some shows in 2010) *Jim Allard ‚Äì bass, vocals (2013 summer tours) *Jeff Chimenti ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (some shows in 2016) Tours =2008= *1500 And Counting Tour *European Tour *Spring Tour *Road To The Roo Tour *All Good Vibes Tour *Like A Tumbleweed Tour *Red Caravan Tour *Cosmic New Year's Run =2009= *Winter Tour *Spring Tour West *Spring Tour East *Summer Tour *Rex Caravan Tour *Fall Tour *Cosmic New Year's Run =2010= *Southbound Winter Tour *One Way Or Another Tour *Seeds Of Light Tour *Rock My Soul Summer Tour *A Slingshot On Mars Tour *Wings A Mile Long Tour *From A City Near You Tour *Cosmic New Year's Run =2011= *Southbound Winter Tour *Four Winds Tour *Into The Sun Tour *Hearts Of Summer Tour *Last Rose Of Summer Tour *Fall Tour *Cosmic New Year's Run =2012= *Southbound Winter Tour *European Tour *Spring Tour West *Spring Tour East *Meet Me At The Jubilee Summer Tour *Fall Tour West *Fall Tour East *Cosmic New Year's Run =2013= *Winter Tour *Spring Tour West *Spring Tour East *Summer Tour Midwest *Summer Tour Northeast *Fall Tour West *Fall Tour East *Cosmic New Year's Run =2014= *Winter tour *Spring tour east *Fall tour east =2015= *Special Acoustic Show at Terrapin Crossroads *Spring Tour West *Rob Eaton to perform with The Rocky Mountain Grateful Dead Revue *Rob Eaton to perform with Axile Tilt *Special Acoustic Show in Washington, D.C. *Spring Tour East *Dark Star Jubilee *Mattson, Barraco & Friends *3 Special JGB Shows *Summer Tour References Further reading     * Interview with Rob Eaton on Centerstage Chicago (January 2007) External links * www.darkstarorchestra.net, official website of Dark Star Orchestra * www.dinoenglishproductions.com, official website of Dino English * Live Dark Star Orchestra at the Internet Archive *www.johnkmusic.net ‚Äì John Kadlecik's official website & personal pages *Interview with John Kadlecik from honesttune.com *Jeff Mattson sits down with Ira Haberman of The Sound Podcast for a feature interview *John Kadlecik feature interview on The Sound Podcast with Ira Haberman Category:Tribute bands Category:Grateful Dead Category:Rock music groups from Illinois Category:1997 establishments in Illinois Category:Jam bands Category:American psychedelic rock music groups ","title":"Dark Star Orchestra"},{"id":"2990014","text":"Montebello Unified School District is a school district based in Montebello, California, United States.

Daniel Dyson is the local mayor for this estate The estate is bounded in the east by the Blaise Castle estate and woods. It is situated at the edge of the Severn flood plain, directly beneath the wooded Kingsweston Hill. The industrial complex and port of Avonmouth is a mile or so west, across the flood plain. Lawrence Weston forms part of the city ward of Kingsweston. Lawrence Weston was originally a hamlet, a tything of the parish of Henbury.Extract from National Gazetteer, 1868 It was transformed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when the estate was built, absorbing both the original hamlet and the neighbouring hamlet of Kings Weston. Originally council owned, much of the housing stock is now in private hands. It is known as \\"El Dub\\" or \\"L' Dub\\" to its inhabitants. The row of shops in Ridingleaze has been revamped and each shop is now adorned with a mural. Lawrence Weston is well known locally for its vibrant facilities for young people. There are two youth centres, a BMX track, a young people's shop called Juicy Blitz and a Youth Inclusion project. It has a community farm and a range of clubs and groups for young people. Kings Weston House and Kings Weston Roman Villa both lie near the western end of the estate. Lawrence Weston Moor Lawrence Weston Moor is an 11.9 hectare local nature reserve leased from Bristol City Council and managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust. The drier fields are hay meadows where plants such as meadowsweet and pepper-saxifrage are common. The wetter meadows have ragged robin, marsh marigold and creeping forget-me-not. The fields and old pollarded willows support birds such as reed buntings, snipe, reed and sedge warblers, little owls and kestrels. The rhynes are rich in water plants and provide homes for common frogs and many insects, such as dragonflies.

While most of these fish are caught on shallow, grassy flats, spotted seatrout reside in virtually any inshore waters, from the surf of outside islands to far up coastal rivers, where they often come for shelter during cold weather. Contrary to its name, the spotted seatrout is not a member of the trout family (Salmonidae), but of the drum family (Sciaenidae). It is popular for commercial and especially recreational fishing in coastal waters of the southeastern United States. Adults reach 19-32 inches in length and 3-15 pounds in weight. Distribution Spotted seatrout live in the top of the water column and are most numerous along the coasts of the southeastern states, such as Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida. They are also common along the coasts of North and South Carolina and Virginia. Estuarine coasts are prime settlement areas. They are uncommonly seen north of Delaware Bay and along the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Characteristics Spotted seatrout is the common name endorsed by the American Fisheries Society. However, this fish has many other common names, including speckled trout, speck, speckles, spec, truite gris (Louisiana French), trucha de mar (Mexican Spanish), spotted weakfish, spotted seateague, southern seateague, salmon, salmon trout, simon trout, winter trout, seatrout, Nosferatu fish, and black trout. Particularly large ones are nicknamed gator trout.Ford, F., D.T., Clarke, P. Kaminsky. Fish: 77 Great Fish of North America. The Greenwich Workshop Press, Seymour, Connecticut, pp:76-77 The spotted seatrout has prominent canine teeth. Like other fish of the family Sciaenidae, it has an elongated, soft dorsal fin with scales; it is separated from the spinous dorsal fin by a deep notch. It usually has two anal spines and the lateral line extends to the tip of the caudal fin. The back has distinct spots scattered on it, including on the dorsal and caudal fins. Unlike some other members of the family Sciaenidae, the spotted seatrout does not have any chin barbels. In stained water, this fish's background may take on a golden hue. Its shape and coloration is reminiscent of a brown trout. This fish is closely related to the weakfish, Cynoscion regalis. The average size of spotted seatrout is 0.5-1.0 kg (1-2 lb), but in most areas fish up to 2.5 kg (5 lb) are fairly common. Fish weighing 3.5-4.5 kg (8-10 lb) are rare. The world record is 7.9 kg (17 lb 7 oz). Food Small trout eat large amounts of shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow larger, their diets shift toward fish, the larger, the better. Studies in Texas and Mississippi show that really big trout strongly prefer to feed on mullet; a large trout will find the largest mullet it can handle and try to swallow it. Often the mullet is half or two-thirds as large as the trout.Horst, J. Speckled Trout Fact Sheet SeaGrant Louisiana. 2005 p. 1-2 Reproduction and growth Like all members of the drum family, mature males make a \\"drumming\\" sound to attract females during the spawning season. Spotted seatrout have a long spawning season from spring through summer. Larval seatrout reach 5‚Äì7 mm in length about two weeks after hatching, and 170‚Äì200 mm within about seven months. It takes between one and two years for seatrout to reach 300 mm (about 12 inches) and between two and three years to reach 400 mm in length (about 16 inches). The maximum age of spotted seatrout that have been caught is estimated to be 12 years old, though that is rare, and the oldest fish caught on a regular basis are closer to four or five years old.Murphy, MD and McMichael, RH. Age determination and growth of spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus (Pisces: Sciaenidae). In Bortone, S.A., ed., Biology of the Spotted Seatrout. CRC Press, 2003 By the end of the first year, spotted seatrout are about 250 mm long and about half of them are mature enough to reproduce.DeVries, DA et al. The demographics and reproductive biology of spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, in six northwest Florida estuaries.In Bortone, S.A., ed., Biology of the Spotted Seatrout. CRC Press, 2003 They reproduce in shallow, grassy areas of estuaries. As spotted seatrout grow longer, they increase in weight. The relationship between weight and length is not linear. The relationship between total length (in millimeters) and weight (in grams) can be expressed by an equation of the form: W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Spotted seatrout weight vs. lengthJenkins, J.A. Fish Bioindicators of Ecosystem Condition at the Calcasieu Estuary, Louisiana. USGS National Wetlands Research Center, Lafayette, LA. Open-File Report 2004-1323 Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species.R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996. The coefficient c and the exponent b are found by fitting an equation of this form to measured weight-length data. For some fish, including spotted seatrout, the weight-length relationships vary with the seasons and with gender. Jenkins reported slightly different relationships for male and female spotted seatrout, and for fall and spring: Fall/male: W = 0.00000534L3.093 Spring/male: W = 0.000011535L2.989 Fall/female: W = 0.000006252L3.066 Spring/female: W = 0.000007834L3.035 Only the relationship for male spotted seatrout in the spring appears noticeably different from the others on a graph. Fishing While spotted seatrout are caught by both commercial and recreational fishermen, recreational fishing represents the vast majority of the catch. Almost all spotted seatrout are caught with hook and line, as many places have banned fishing for them with gillnets. Spotted seatrout are among the top ten species for recreational fishing in the United States. According to the NOAA, spotted seatrout are in the top ten species for recreational fishing in the United States.Monterey Bay Aquarium sustainable seafood report for Spotted Seatrout, October, 2011 From 1993 ‚Äì 2003, recreational fishermen in Louisiana harvested more than 6 million spotted seatrout each year. Along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia, more than half a million speckled trout were caught by recreational fishermen each year between 2005 and 2008.North Carolina Spotted Seatrout Fishery Management Plan. North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries. March, 2010 Nevertheless, because they reproduce so well, spotted seatrout is listed as a ‚Äúbest choice‚Äù for sustainable seafood in Louisiana and Florida by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch. Management The management of the species is limited to size and possession limits, but programs have been initiated to gather more information on their overall health and abundance.

This was the sixth and final film in MGM's Tarzan series and was the studio's last Tarzan feature until 1957's Tarzan and the Lost Safari.

Retrieved: January 7, 2015. Plot Workers land an aircraft in the jungles of Africa in search of lions for their circus. While trapping lions, the three men meet with Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller), Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) and their adopted son Boy (Johnny Sheffield). Watching Boy's tricks with the elephants, the head of the circus, Buck Rand (Charles Bickford), realizes that Boy would be a great act for the circus. The group is attacked by natives, and it appears that Tarzan and Jane have perished in a jungle fire. The men take Boy on their aircraft and return to the United States. Tarzan's loyal chimp Cheeta wakes Tarzan and Jane before they are burned to death by the fire. Cheeta tells Tarzan that Boy has left with the men on their aircraft. Tarzan, Jane, and Cheeta track across the jungle and, flying across the Atlantic, eventually end up in New York City, where Tarzan is befuddled by the lifestyle and gadgetry of \\"civilization\\". Tarzan displays his quaint, \\"noble savage\\" ways by complaining about the necessity of wearing clothing, commenting that an opera singer that he hears on a \\"noisy box\\" is \\"Woman sick! Scream for witch doctor!\\", and expressing his childlike wonderment at taxi cabs. Tarzan comments that various African-Americans he sees making a living throughout New York City are from this or that tribe back in his and Jane's jungle home. Tarzan and Jane attempt to get Boy back by legal means. This leads to a moving sequence where the judge asks Tarzan what the fishing is like back in Africa and what he considers to be the important things that he needs to teach his adopted son. Unfortunately, the circus retains an unscrupulous lawyer (Charles Lane), who tricks Jane into admitting that Boy was not born in the jungle and is not her actual child, provoking Tarzan into attacking him in the courtroom. Tarzan makes a daring escape out a courtroom window onto a wide ledge and after a rooftop chase by the police, he ends up making a spectacular high dive off the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River. Tarzan locates the circus where Boy is being held and enlists the aid of the elephants who are chained to stakes. He calls to them with his \\"jungle speak\\" yell, and they take their revenge on their tormentors by tearing free from their chains and destroying the circus. In the ensuing bedlam that follows Tarzan is able to rescue Boy. Before they return to Africa, the judge grants Tarzan and Jane full legal custody of their son.

The suburb was initially developed during the 1930s. The A37 road, which passes through Whitchurch, links Bristol with Dorchester. Within Bristol the A37 is known as Wells Road. It was one of the first dual carriageways to be built in Bristol.  History  The name means \\"the white church\\", and was first recorded in 1230. (Another source dated about 1500 may be a copy of a record dated to 1065). The village in its present location dates from about the 12th century, when the centre of population of an older village named Filton, Filwood or Felton, west of the present village, moved to the present site. The parish was still sometimes known as Felton as late as the 19th century. The parish of Whitchurch was part of the Keynsham Hundred in Somerset. The parish became a civil parish in 1866. The northern parts of the civil parish were transferred to Bristol in the 1930s and 1951.Vision of Britain website From then Whitchurch was divided between a suburb of Bristol and a village outside the city in Somerset.  The suburb of Bristol  Whitchurch taken from Maes Knoll The suburb now lies in the council wards of Whitchurch Park and Hengrove. The suburb is one of only two parts of Bristol not to use the 0117 dialling code. Along with Stockwood, Whitchurch numbers use the 01275 of north Somerset instead. Facilities close by include the Hengrove Leisure Park which includes a Cineworld Cinema, various restaurants/food retailers (Frankie & Benny's, McDonald's, KFC), a Gala Bingo hall and a popular activities park including skateboard and climbing frame type facilities. Adjacent to the leisure park is Hawkfield Business Park, which is a significant source of commerce and employment for the suburb. The suburb is home to the Whitchurch Sports Centre, and used to be an occasional venue for pro-boxing bouts. It has a dilapidated Whitchurch athletics stadium. The sports centre is also earmarked for demolition, once the new sports centre and olympic sized swimming pool are finished as part of the expanded Hengrove Leisure Park redevelopment. In October 2006, Whitchurch Sports Centre was taken over by Action Sport UK, a South African company. Some of Whitchurch Sports Centre's activities are now based at Withywood Sports Centre and Ashton Park School Sports Centre. The suburb is also home to rugby union club Bristol Barbarians who reside in Norton lane. The club currently play in Somerset 1 and are coached by Steve Penfold. Whitchurch is also the birthplace of famous snooker player and world champion Judd Trump. On 2 August 2005 the beginnings of a tornado (a funnel) floated in the skies above South Bristol. As it did not touch it cannot be classed as a tornado but nevertheless it provided an unusual yet impressive sight for the residents of Whitchurch and surrounding parts of Bristol, such as Stockwood. BBC News  The village  The village of Whitchurch is a civil parish in the unitary authority of Bath and Northeast Somerset. In the 2001 census the civil parish had a population of 1,354. Between 1925 and 1959 the village was served by Whitchurch Halt, a station on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway.  Church  St Nicholas Church, Whitchurch St Bernadette's Catholic Church, Whitchurch The ecclesiastical parish includes both the civil parish in Somerset and the suburb in Bristol.Map of parish The parish church is in the village in Somerset, and is dedicated to St Nicholas. St. Augustine's Church on Whitchurch Lane was opened in 1972 but closed in 2007.  Airport  Whitchurch Airport was located on the land which is now home to the Hengrove Leisure Park. The airport was used before World War II by internal UK scheduled flights. During the war it was the base for various types of military aircraft (which flew from there on various missions) and civilian aircraft (which were moved there to avoid their destruction at more vulnerable airports such as Croydon). Whitchurch Airport and Liverpool Airport were the only civil airports in England to remain in use during World War II. Imperial Airways (later BOAC) flew to Lisbon in neutral Portugal: at one time in 1941 there were 1200 people waiting for a flight to Lisbon.Bristol Record Office accession 44394: Doris Ogilvie diary There were also a large number of espionage flights to France and elsewhere in occupied Europe. When the war finished, Bristol needed a larger airport. Farm land in Lulsgate was purchased and Lulsgate Airport (later to be Bristol Airport) was opened. For a short time from 1959, the old airport was used as a motor racing circuit Whitchurch Circuit for Formula Two and Formula Three races. The airport is also the home of st bernadettes rugby club currently playing in Somerset prem. Current club captain also plays international rugby for Jordan.

He was the second and last Whig mayor of the city, and notably served as mayor during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.  Early life and education  His family came from Massachusetts and was of old Puritan stock. He was born in the town of Greene, Maine. What instruction he had was obtained from his parents, who, at night, taught him a little reading, writing, and arithmetic. By his own efforts, however, he later acquired a good education. The father was a hatter by trade and brought his son up to follow the same business. Crossman left home at an early age to seek his fortune in the cities. He went first to Philadelphia but in 1829 moved to New Orleans, where he arrived with only five dollars in his pocket.  Career  He managed to open a small shop in Canal Street, at the time a very poor location. His business succeeded almost immediately, however, and it was not long before he was one of New Orleans' more respected merchants, becoming a director in several banks and an officer of some of the more prominent benevolent societies. In 1844 Crossman was elected to the State Legislature, becoming also a member of the Council of the First Municipality. He advanced to the post of chairman of the finance committee, a position which had been abandoned by several able men, on account of the difficulties which the management of the local finances were beginning to develop. Crossman set to work to reduce expenses and increase revenues, with such success that he was soon able to put the credit of the municipality upon a secure basis. It was this proof of administrative talent that led to his nomination for mayor, by the Whig Party in 1846.  Electoral History  The election, held on April 5, 1846, gave Crossman a plurality of 2,989 votes, against two other candidates who split the Democratic Party vote, Guirot with 2,743, and former mayor Joseph Edgard Montegut with 1,614. By the end of his first term, Crossman had been so successful that he handily won his next election on April 3, 1848, 5,090 votes to 2,986 for the sole opposing candidate; his third term was secured by a much harder fought victory, with 4,984 votes to 4,452 for Bell, the Democratic candidate. His fourth and final term was the hardest fought, with 4,993 votes going to Crossman and 4,877 to his opponent Lewis, the candidate of a new reform party. In general, his power base was the older quarter of town, which for most of his tenure was represented by the First Municipality.  Tenure  The salient events of Crossman's long administration were the patriotic and military enterprises undertaken in the city in connection with the war in Mexico; the flooding of the city in 1849, caused by a break in one of the levees; the Spanish riot of 1851; yellow fever epidemics in 1852 and 1853, the worst in the city's history to date; and the new city charter, in which the three-municipality system was abandoned for a return to a single, efficient government. During the war New Orleans was the chief military depot of operations against Mexico. The streets were constantly filled with recruits on their way to join their commands at various stations in the West. With them came many undesirable characters, the control of whom imposed serious burdens on the city's small police force. Sick and destitute, also, collected in the wake of the army. Not only was the mayor called on to preserve order, but to devise methods whereby charity might effectively provide for the unfortunate. Benevolence was a conspicuous trait of Mayor Crossman's character; he threw himself into charity work with zeal and success. The 1849 flooding of New Orleans was due to a break in a levee on the Sauv√© plantation north of the city on May 3; by May 30, \\"Sauv√©'s Crevasse\\" had caused the inundation of 220 blocks and the displacement of 12,000 people. After the flood, much of New Orleans had to be repaved, drainage gutters replaced, and a new levee was built on Felicity Street. On August 21, 1851, a serious riot broke out in New Orleans when it became known that a revolution led by General Narciso L√≥pez had failed to take control of that island, and had been executed by the Cuban government: L√≥pez having obtained much of his financial backing in New Orleans, a mob wrecked a number of Spanish-owned stores in the city and attacked the Spanish consulate. Rather than quell the riot, the city let it run; Spain was eventually compensated by the American government.t. Tomb of Mayor Abdiel Crossman Greenwood CemeteryApril 12, 1852 may be considered the crowning date of Crossman's career. He had striven to repel the cumbersome three-municipality charter of the city, and succeeded when a new city charter was adopted on that date, reconsolidating the three municipalities (and incidentally annexing the suburb of Lafayette).t. Crossman also worked to promote railroad links between New Orleans and the rest of the country, and to have the U. S. government establish a naval depot in town. At the end of his fourth term, in accordance with the provisions of the new city charter which prohibited the immediate reelection of a mayor, he stepped down; continuing, however, to serve New Orleans in various political capacities, chiefly as a member of the council.t.  Death  Crossman died on June 13, 1859 in New Orleans and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery.t.

As a member of Wendy's clique, Jill participates in the bullying without remorse, though Wendy and Caroline are usually the instigators. Linda confronts Jill and threatens her with revenge after one incident, but Jill dismisses the threat, confident of her status and protection as one of Wendy's circle. Jill and her friend Tracy play a prank on their grouch of a neighbor, Mr. Machinist, on Halloween, stuffing raw rotten eggs into his mailbox, but are later identified from a photo taken by Mr. Machinist and are made to rake the leaves in his backyard as punishment. While raking, Jill and Tracy find they need to use the restroom. They urinate all over Mr. Machinist's trees as a sort of payback. Remembering Linda's threat, Jill suspects that \\"Blubber\\" was the one who tattled on her and Tracy; Tracy, however, suspects Wendy and Caroline, which infuriates Wendy. To appease Wendy, Jill suggests that the class hold a mock trial for Linda (with Wendy, naturally, as judge, and a jury made up of several classmates). To this suggestion, Tracy remarks that she thinks Jill is scared of Wendy. Jill soon realizes that Tracy is right. The \\"trial\\" falls apart when Wendy, as judge, denies Linda her right to a \\"lawyer\\", and Jill, frustrated with herself for so readily following Wendy's lead, finally stands up to Wendy, who also arouses Jill's anger by making a racial slur against Tracy, who is Chinese-American. Linda, who has been locked in the classroom closet, is set free by Jill. Wendy, furious that Jill has dared to question her authority, threatens to make Jill \\"sorry [she was] ever born\\". Jill comes to school the next morning to find that Wendy has made good on her threat and turned the entire class against her, tagging her with the nickname \\"B. B.\\" (short for \\"Baby Brenner\\"). Jill's tormentors include Linda, who has joined with Wendy and is more than willing to bully one of her former harassers. Jill believes that she can be stronger by playing into the jokes. However, when she tries to laugh at their taunting, they even use that to make fun of her. Instead, Jill goes further to fight against the bullying by setting Wendy, Linda, and Wendy's best friend Caroline against each other, telling Caroline she should make her own decisions and that she is no longer Wendy's best friend, that Linda has taken her place, which Linda affirms. Caroline is hurt and Wendy is furious at Linda. Jill makes friends with Rochelle, a quiet girl in the class who has never participated in the bullying. By the end, although the class atmosphere is tense, no one is being singled out or picked on. Jill comments (the book is in a first-person narrative) on how the friendships in the class have changed completely in the classroom but how Tracy is a friend she can always count on having. Characters Jill Brenner ‚Äî The main character in the book. She goes to Hillside School, a school for fifth and sixth graders. She is shown to be average, and she is one of the many people in the class who bullies Linda. She is best friends with Tracy Wu, and becomes friends with Wendy and Caroline, but the friendship ends abruptly when she dares to challenge Wendy's authority. Also, at the end of the book she becomes good friends with a new girl in her class named Rochelle. Unlike many of Judy Blume's main characters, Jill has a mean nature and is quite cruel in her taunting, though she chiefly follows Wendy and Caroline's lead. She is in Mrs. Minish's fifth grade class. Like all the other students in the class, Jill calls Linda \\"Blubber\\". She dresses as a flenser for Halloween, instead of being a witch like she was for the last three years. Her chief hobby is stamp collecting, and she has problems with math. Wendy ‚Äî The class president of Jill's class. She is an excellent student, smart, popular, and powerful, but uses her power to bully others and control her classmates. She is best friends with Caroline for most of the book but near the end of the book becomes best friends with Linda. At the very end she ends up becoming best friends with Laurie. She likes salami a lot, so she always trades lunches with Caroline. In addition, Wendy is manipulative and an excellent liar. She nicknames Linda \\"Blubber\\", because Linda presented a report on the whale and she is large-bodied. She lives in Hidden Valley with Caroline, Robby, and Linda. She has never been in the same class as Jill, Donna, Bruce, or Robby before this year. Caroline ‚Äî Another classmate of Jill's. She is Wendy's best friend and her sidekick in bullying Linda. She always does what Wendy says, and seems to be a little bit afraid of her. Caroline always backs up what Wendy says. She loves tuna fish sandwiches, so she trades lunches with Wendy every day. She calls Linda \\"Blubber,\\" like almost everybody else in the class. She lives in Hidden Valley with Wendy, Robby, and Linda. Near the end of the book, Caroline becomes best friends with Donna Davidson. She has never been in the same class as Jill, Donna, Bruce, or Robby before this year. Linda Fischer ‚Äî A girl in Jill's class who is nicknamed \\"Blubber,\\" since she did a report on whale's fat (blubber) and is full-figured and plain. She also is very submissive and does not know how to defend or assert herself. Near the end of the book, she becomes best friends with Wendy, but by the end, she is a loner again. She lives in Hidden Valley with Wendy, Caroline, and Robby. This is the second year she has been in Jill, Donna, Robby, and Bruce's class. By coincidence, she runs into Jill at Warren Winkler's Bar Mitzvah, as her parents are also friends with the Winklers as are the Brenners. Kenny Brenner ‚Äî Jill's younger brother. He is in fourth grade at Longmeadow School. He wins the Halloween contest for the most original costume, because he dresses as a witch, but with a cigar, and yellow goggles. He always recites facts from his Guinness Book of World Records and often annoys Jill. Tracy Wu ‚Äî Jill's next-door neighbor and best friend. She is a Chinese-American, and a stamp collector, like Jill. She and her family own a lot of animals. Her Halloween costumer was Big Bird, and as a result won a prize for the Most Beautiful Costume. She is in a different fifth grade class, and has a much better teacher who is always thinking up fun ways for his students to learn. Gordon Brenner ‚Äî Jill and Kenny's father. He works as a tax accountant for a living. Ann Brenner ‚Äî Jill and Kenny's mother. She is trying to stop smoking cigarettes. She can blow very big chewing gum bubbles. She swears around the house often, and is okay with her kids doing it, as long as they know that there are some people who don't approve of those words. Her job involves working with computers. Rochelle ‚Äî A new girl in school. She is the only one who tried to defend Linda. In the end she becomes friends with Jill. Donna Davidson ‚Äî A girl in Jill's class. She likes horses and dresses as a horse for Halloween every year except for this year, when she is a jockey. She has been in the same class as Jill, Bruce, and Robby since kindergarten; this is her second year with Linda and her first year with Wendy and Caroline. In the end she becomes best friends with Caroline. Robby Winters ‚Äî A student in Jill's class. He has been in Donna, Bruce, and Jill's class since kindergarten. Bruce Bonaventura ‚Äî A boy in Jill's class. He is the fattest kid in the grade. He has been in the same class as Jill, Donna and Robby since kindergarten, this is his second year with Linda, and his first year with Wendy and Caroline. Mr. Machinist ‚Äî A mean man who lives in Hidden Valley. He reports Jill and Tracy to their parents for putting rotten eggs in his mailbox on Halloween. He always turns the hose on kids who venture onto his property. Warren Winkler ‚Äî A boy who is the son of Gordon's friend. He is Jewish. Jill and her family attend his bar mitzvah, as do Linda and her family. He can read Hebrew perfectly. Jill dislikes him. Mrs. Sandmeier - The Brenner family's Swiss-born housekeeper and nanny to Jill and Kenny. She is trilingual (part of her job is to teach Jill and Kenny to speak French) and an excellent cook. Great Maudie - Jill and Kenny's great-aunt who moves in as nanny to the children while Mrs. Sandmeier is on vacation. She is a hippie who practices yoga and forces health foods like \\"wheat germ mush\\" on the children. Mrs. Minish ‚Äî Jill's very strict fifth grade teacher. Irwin ‚Äî Jill's classmate. Catches Linda during the \\"Blubber Trial\\" when Linda tried to escape. Judy Blume on Blubber According to Judy Blume in a short essay published in a recent reprint of the novel, the plot of Blubber was inspired by a very similar real-life incident involving her daughter's 5th grade class, in which one girl was singled out for torment by the class leader, who led her classmates in bullying her. \\"My daughter was the shy, quiet girl in the class, the observer, like Rochelle\\", Blume wrote. \\"She was upset by what was going on, but she didn't know what to do about it. She was scared. Like many other kids in that class, she worried she could wind up the next victim of the bullying.\\" Blume also explained that she wrote Blubber to encourage children who see bullying taking place, as well as the bullies' victims themselves, to tell someone they trust rather than keep it to themselves.

It consists of steps that combine the data with portions of the key. Details The most common form of key whitening is xor-encrypt-xor -- using a simple XOR before the first round and after the last round of encryption. The first block cipher to use a form of key whitening is DES-X, which simply uses two extra 64-bit keys for whitening, beyond the normal 56-bit key of DES. This is intended to increase the complexity of a brute force attack, increasing the effective size of the key without major changes in the algorithm. DES-X's inventor, Ron Rivest, named the technique whitening. The cipher FEAL (followed by Khufu and Khafre) introduced the practice of key whitening using portions of the same key used in the rest of the cipher. This offers no additional protection from brute force attacks, but it can make other attacks more difficult. In a Feistel cipher or similar algorithm, key whitening can increase security by concealing the specific inputs to the first and last round functions. In particular, it is not susceptible to a meet-in-the-middle attack. This form of key whitening has been adopted as a feature of many later block ciphers, including AES, MARS, RC6, and Twofish.

The formal class program may also prepare existing license holders for an overseas license conversion or medical assessment driving test or refresher course. It may take place in a classroom, in a vehicle, online, or a combination of the above. Topics of instruction include traffic code or laws and vehicle operation. Typically, instruction will warn of dangerous conditions in driving such as road conditions, driver impairments, and hazardous weather. Instructional videos may also be shown, demonstrating proper driving strategies and the consequences for not observing the rules. Education is intended to supplement the knowledge obtained from government-printed driving handbooks or manuals and prepares students for tests to obtain a driver's license or learner's permit. In-car instruction places a student in a vehicle with an instructor. A car fitted with dual controls, which has pedals or other controls on the passenger side, may be used. History Driver training began as a business in the United Kingdom in 1909-1910. The British School of Motoring (BSM) was founded in 1910 in South London by Hugh Stanley Roberts. It offered hands-on training and courses in driving skills (managing the controls and road aptitude) and repair. It also offered vehicles to drivers who wished to practice. In the United States, Amos Neyhart, a professor at Penn State University, started the first high school driver's ed course in 1934 at a high school in State College, Pennsylvania. The more correct and original designation is driver education, without the possessive, as with teacher education, or driving education as with nursing education. However over time the possessive version has become dominant. Instruction Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania training vehicle Driver's education (or driver education) is intended to supplement the knowledge obtained from government-printed driving handbooks or manuals and prepares students for tests to obtain a driver's license or learner's permit. In-car instruction places a student in a vehicle with an instructor. A car fitted with dual controls, which has pedals or other controls on the passenger side, may be used. In the United States, driver's education is typically offered to students who are sixteen years old or will be by the end of the course. Each state has its own laws regarding the licensing of teenagers. In Germany, space is at a premium while traffic is able to flow very efficiently and with less accidents. The way in which people are taught driving fundamentals plays a huge role in the safety and efficiency of traffic. Within the United States, students may have access to online training, classroom training, or parent-taught courses. While these classes may provide a lot of information to the student, their effectivity may only be limited to one area of knowledge. In Germany, students are given a hybrid of these classes. They have much more exposure throughout their school to real- world scenarios and classroom curriculum. Fundamentals of driving are reinforced in these classes, including the importance of turn-signal usage, keeping a safe distance behind others, and maintaining situational awareness. It is argued that more efficient and safer traffic flow can be achieved by increasing the length of driver's education classes in the United States, to involve more hands-on training and a strengthening of driving principles. Online courses An online driving education is one of the most affordable and convenient ways to acquire driving education. Many driver's education courses are available online. It is up to the relevant government authority to accept any such programs as meeting their requirements. Online drivers ed may be taken as a substitute for classroom courses in 13 states. Some car insurance agencies offer discounts to those students who have completed a driver's education program. Online programs allow parents to administer the behind the wheel driving instruction. Many studies have also started looking at the relationship between online activity, especially among the young adults, and driving licence holding Obtaining a license Successful completion of a driver education course is required by many agencies before young drivers receive their driver license or learner's permit. In some countries students taking driver's education have the opportunity to receive a waiver for successful course completion which allows them to receive a learner's permit or driver's license without taking some of the tests. On track Some car clubs conduct driver education programs focused on how to handle a car under high-speed driving conditions rather than on learning the rules of the road. These programs take place at road racing courses and include both classroom instruction and vehicle-based instruction. Students drive with an experienced instructor until they are \\"signed off\\". At this point they can continue practicing and improving their skills without an instructor. Driver education programs involve multiple cars together on a racetrack, but they are not considered racing because they are not timed, winners are not declared, and drivers must wait to pass until the driver being passed gives permission with a hand signal. These programs require approved racing helmets and rollover protection for convertibles. Some require long- sleeved shirts and long pants for fire safety. However, they do not require full roll cages, five or six-point seat belts, fire extinguishers, fire- resistant racing suits, or other safety features seen in racing and more.

The name \\"Lavard\\" is an epithet which probably derives from the Old Norse word for lord. Background Sigurd Sverresson Lavard is mentioned the first time during the struggles of Nidaros in November 1181, when Sverre's rival, King Magnus Erlingsson, took the city. According to Saxo Grammaticus, Sigurd was born while Sverre still lived on the Faroes and received the name Un√•s, honouring the man then thought to be Sverre's father. Later when Sverre claimed to be the son of King Sigurd Munn, Sverre had his own son change name accordingly. Sverre became king of Norway by leading a rebellion against the previous King Magnus.Sigurd Lavard (Store norske leksikon) Career King Magnus was defeated and killed in 1184, but in 1196 his old followers united to form the Bagler party. The first encounter between Sverre and the Baglers took place along the coast of R√•nrike. King Sverre gave Sigurd Lavard the responsibility of guarding a ballista which he had built. However, during the night, the Baglers launched a surprise attack. Sigurd and his men were caught off guard and chased away and the ballista destroyed. Sigurd was not given any commands after this episode. Sigurd Lavard died in 1200 or 1201 while his father was still alive.

It is commonly known as Olympic Park but officially named Sydney Olympic Park.Lifestyle choices on your doorstep Sydney Olympic Park The area was originally part of the suburb of Homebush Bay, but was designated a suburb in its own right in 2009. The name Homebush is still used colloquially as a metonym for Stadium Australia as well as the Olympic Park precinct as a whole. Sydney Olympic Park features a large sports and entertainment area, originally redeveloped for the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The stadiums, arenas and venues continue to be used for sporting, musical, and cultural events, including the Sydney Royal Easter Show, Sydney Festival and a number of world-class sporting fixtures. The suburb also contains commercial developments, residential buildings and extensive parklands. History 281x281px =Aboriginal land= Aboriginal people have been associated with the Homebush Bay area for many thousands of years. When Europeans arrived in 1788, the Homebush Bay area formed part of the traditional lands of the Wanngal clan. The lands of the Wanngal clan extended along the southern shore of the Parramatta River between about Leichhardt and Auburn. The Wanngal clan would have had access rights to the resources of the Homebush Bay area, but would have routinely interacted with neighbouring clan groups. Shortly after the British colonisation of Sydney several smallpox epidemics ravaged the local Aboriginal population, leaving many of the clans seriously depleted. By way of adaptation, members of neighbouring clan groups are known to have joined together to ensure their survival. Aboriginal people were still using the Homebush Bay area in the early 1800s even after their lands were granted to Europeans. Several encounters and conflicts between Europeans and Aboriginal people are documented for the Homebush Bay area throughout the 1790s, and in the early 1800s Aboriginal people (perhaps of the Wanngal clan) were working for and supplying fish to Europeans in the area.Cameo, 2002: 46 No references have yet been located which describe Aboriginal people living in the Homebush Bay area for the period after the 1810s; however, this is the subject of ongoing research through the Aboriginal History & Connections Program, a long-term program aimed at documenting Aboriginal connections to the Homebush Bay area before and after the arrival of Europeans launched by the Sydney Olympic Park Authority in April 2002. Today the Homebush Bay area is within the asserted traditional cultural boundary of the Darug language group, of which the Wanngal clan is said to have belonged. The descendants of Darug traditional owners of the Sydney area play a custodial role in the preservation of Aboriginal cultural heritage and are actively involved with archaeological and historical research in and around Homebush area. The area also falls within the administrative boundary of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council which also plays a major role in the investigation and preservation of Aboriginal culture and heritage. =Colonisation= The Sydney Olympic Park locality was first known to Europeans as \\"The Flats\\", as described by Lieutenant Bradley in his charting of the river in 1788. The name \\"Liberty Plains\\" was also given to the locality but referred to the higher and drier lands along Parramatta Road and referred to the first group of settlers who were free rather than convict, who established farms there in 1793.Carney & Mider, 1996: 11 The first European settler was Thomas Laycock (1756?-1809), who was granted 40 hectares between Parramatta Road and Homebush Bay in October 1794. He named his farm, Home Bush and ran sheep and cattle there. Laycock was Quartermaster of the NSW Corps and also held other government positions. D'Arcy Wentworth (c.1762-1827) purchased the 318 hectare holding from the Laycock family in January 1808. With additional grants Wentworth's holdings at Homebush Bay totalled 372 hectares by 1810. Wentworth established a horse stud and a private racetrack adjoining Parramatta Road and was influential among the early government officials and free settlers. He died at Homebush on 7 July 1827.(ADB, Vol. II) Homebush was inherited by William Wentworth (1790-1872), who continued in his father's tradition of controversial public service. With his neighbour Gregory Blaxland, he was in the first exploration party to find a route through the Blue Mountains. He expanded and developed his father's bequest of properties, becoming one of the colony's richest men by his death in 1872. The property was let to numerous tenants throughout William's ownership, while he lived at Vaucluse House in Sydney. William, who was elected president of the Sydney Turf Club in 1832, gave permission for the existing racetrack to be upgraded for public race meetings. The racetrack included grandstands, stables and spelling paddocks which stretched over the Sydney Olympic Park site. The property was inherited by William Wentworth's son, Fitzwilliam.Painter & Waterhouse, 1992:15-22 =State Abattoir= In 1907 367 hectares, most of the Wentworth estate, was resumed for the building of the State Abattoirs. Specifications for the general arrangement and layout of the site and drawings of the gatehouse, administration buildings, mutton, pork, beef and veal houses were completed in 1909 by the Department of Public Works under Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon and construction completed in 1913. The gardens were also designed in 1913 by Joseph Maiden, Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, including the historic formal avenue of trees that is located on the eastern boundary of the Overflow. Consisting of Brush Box (Lophostemon confertus) and Spotted Gum (Eucalyptus maculata) this row of trees is referred to as \\"the allee\\".OCA Tender documents, 2001 The cauldron is located in the Overflow, a park just west of the former main abattoir administration precinct and allee, on land which formed a car park for the abattoir. By 1923 the State Abattoir employed 1,600 people and had a killing capacity of 25,000 animals a week, making it one of the largest abattoirs in Australia. The abattoirs continued to expand during World War II and into the 1950s with works provided for the treatment of offal, refrigeration, the preparation of tallow, fertilizers, meat for export and canning of pet foods (Godden & Associates 1989: 21ff). By the 1970s the facilities required rebuilding and a decision was taken not to upgrade but to redevelop surplus land for industrial use. The State Abattoir officially closed on 10 June 1988 and the Homebush Abattoir Corporation wound up on 30 June 1992.Fox & Associates 1986: 48-50 Throughout the twentieth century, much of the current land of the site was reclaimed from the river and wetlands by landfill.Sydney Olympic Park Official Site: Education & Learning 281x281px In the mid-1980s, an area bounded by Australia Avenue and what are now Herb Elliott Avenue and Sarah Durack Avenue was promoted as a 'technology park' called the Australia Centre. However, apart from a few relatively high tech businesses like AWA Microelectronics, BASF, Philips and Sanyo, the idea did not catch on and the Australian Technology Park is now in Eveleigh. In any event, a decade later the entire area became the main cluster venue for the 2000 Summer Olympics. After 1992 the Abattoir precinct was occupied by a number of organisations that ultimately became the Sydney Olympic Park Authority (SOPA). Sydney won the right to host the Olympic Games on 23 September 1993, after being selected over Beijing, Berlin, Istanbul and Manchester at the 101st IOC Session in Monte Carlo, Monaco. These activities resulted in a highly contaminated site with little natural ecology and a fragmented stream corridor. Sixty-five percent of the soils were required to be excavated and contained on-site. The site did have some positive attributes that PWP Landscape Architecture enhanced in the design: 15 miles of continuous waterfront; various historic buildings and landscapes; an almost unspoiled 124-acre aboriginal forest; major areas of mangrove swamp; bird sanctuaries; and surviving endangered species like Golden orb spiders and the Green and golden bell frogs that resided in a 70-acre historic limestone quarry, the Brick Pit.http://www.pwpla.com/projects/millennium-parklands/&details; Millennium Parklands was and is a project that matches the scale of the city, dealing with landscape as the system that sustains urban life, the Olmstedian \\"lungs\\" known these days as \\"green infrastructure\\" a component of the urban condition rather than its native opposition.Hassell, Millennium Parklands Concept Plan, prepared for The Olympic Co-ordination Authority (1997), 1. =Post-Olympics= 370x370px With the successful completion of the 2000 Olympics, Sydney Olympic Park has undergone a significant amount of development work to support its conversion to a multipurpose facility with a number of businesses re-locating to the area. Commercial developments now sit alongside sporting facilities with tenants in office buildings such as Commonwealth Bank from September 2007. A five-star Pullman hotel and a two- star Formule 1 hotel were completed in mid-2008. The parklands have undergone redevelopment with Blaxland Riverside Park (formerly Blaxland Common) being transformed into an urban park along Parramatta River. The Park opened on 3 March 2007. In addition the Wentworth Common area was upgraded with significant adventure playground facilities for children aged 8‚Äì13 years. The former Auburn Council sought public comment on a proposal to rename the Homebush Bay area, to remove confusion with its namesake suburb Homebush. The area encompassing Sydney Olympic Park was given autonomy as a suburb, the waterfront residential area was renamed Wentworth Point and the Carter Street industrial precinct was absorbed by the neighbouring suburb of Lidcombe.New Names for Auburn Suburbs  Heritage listings  Sydney Olympic Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Cathy Freeman Park near corner of Olympic Boulevard and the Grand Parade: 2000 Summer Olympics cauldron * Holker Street: Newington Armament Depot and Nature Reserve * Australia Avenue, State Sports Centre: New South Wales Hall of Champions Collection  Events  More than 5000 events are held at Sydney Olympic Park each year, including the Sydney Royal Easter Show, Supanova Pop Culture Expo, Rugby Union, National Rugby League, Australian Football League and Australian Rugby League games at ANZ Stadium. The Sydney International is held each year at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre, and the park also hosts athletics and swimming events, using some venues for concerts during the year, and hosts boxing. It hosts the Big Day Out music festival and has been the venue for free, open air performances as part of the Sydney Festival such as Movies in the Overflow and Music by Moonlight. The Newington Armory has in the past been the venue for the now-defunct \\"Great Escape\\" and \\"Acoustica at the Armory\\" music festivals, both of which were held over the Easter long weekend. Some venues function have changed from the original uses in the 2000 Olympics, such as the baseball stadium which has become the Sydney Showground; the former Sydney Superdome is now known as Allphones Arena and the Olympic Stadium has been renamed ANZ Stadium, following on from its prior sponsor Telstra. The latter two venues are now very successful in their own right, with the stadium serving as the venue for 49 major sporting events in 2007 and the Arena being the world's second-highest grossing venue of its type in the world in 2005 - behind only New York City's Madison Square Garden. A funeral was held for the Lin family at Sydney Olympic Park on 8 August 2009, with the only surviving member, Brenda Lin, in attendance. Between 2009 and 2016, the Sydney 500 V8 Supercar event was held through the streets of the Olympic precinct. EB Games Expo was also hosted at The Sydney Showgrounds within Sydney Olympic Park between 2012 and 2016 present. Culture 280x280px The suburb is home to a significant arts and cultural program including regular events, the largest single precinct public art collection in Australia, the Armoury Gallery which is the largest single room permanent art exhibition space in the Southern Hemisphere, a new theatre,an artist studio facility at Newington Armoury and a BMX track. The suburb is fully dedicated to environmentally and socially sustainable practices and has committed to 'Master Plan 2030': an opportunity to establish a best practice example of sustainable urban development for the next 20 years of the Park's growth. The Master Plan 2030 vision is that the Park will, by 2030, be home to a daily population of 50,000 residents, students and workers, in addition to 10 million visitors per year. 281x281px Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,736 people in Sydney Olympic Park. 22.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 19.8% and South Korea 10.5%. 22.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 20.1% and Korean 11.8%.

It was subsequently ported to the Sega Genesis in 1990. The gameplay combines pseudo-3D driving in the graphical style of Outrun with side-scrolling action as the player controls a police officer driving to and then moved through various seedy locations in a one-man war against crime. The game was the first game on the Genesis to have a warning label due to its violent content. An NES version was developed by Probe Software and supposed to be released in 1992 by Tengen, but was cancelled as Tengen scrapped the idea for the game, due to legal troubles Tengen was dealing with from Nintendo. Only a few sprite-sheets and music by Jeroen Tel exist from the project.http://www.nintendoage.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NES.View&egID;=2327&lgID;=1018 The game was largely panned by video game critics for its simplistic graphics, sound, and the fact that many of the levels looked too similar. Storyline In the single-player side-scrolling game the player is a cop in a seedy futuristic urban city. Armed with a pistol, the player has to kill various thugs, before the timer runs out. While the game has several levels, the background in the game does not change often. The other half of the game is a driving sequence, similar to other computer games such as Roadblasters. Techno Cop was one of the first games made for the Mega Drive/Genesis from a third party developer and was part of an attempt by Razorsoft to test what sort of content would Sega allow on a game made for one of its systems. Violent content Both Nintendo of America and Sega of America insisted upon previewing games made for their system, prior to release, to check for bugs and potentially controversial or offensive content. Sega allowed Techno Cop to be released without requiring Razor Soft to remove or tone down the game's violent content. Along with the blood, when the playable character shot at another character, they would be blown apart. Reception Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, saying \\"despite occasional boredom in the driving segment, the game is extremely absorbing.\\" References External links Play Techno Cop online on Game-Oldies.

NCL documents do not contain multimedia elements such as audio or video content; rather they function as a \\"glue\\" language that specifies how multimedia components are related. In particular, NCL documents specify how these components are synchronized relative to each other and how the components are composed together into a unified document. Among its main facilities, it treats hypermedia relations as first-class entities through the definition of hypermedia connectors, and it can specify arbitrary semantics for a hypermedia composition using the concept of composite templates. NCL is an XML application language that is an extension of XHTML, with XML elements and attributes specified by a modular approach. NCL modules can be added to standard web languages, such as XLink and SMIL. NCL was initially designed for the Web environment, but a major application of NCL is use as the declarative language of the Japanese-Brazilian ISDB-Tb (International Standard for Digital Broadcasting) terrestrial DTV digital television middleware (named Ginga). It is also the first standardized technology of the ITU-T multimedia application framework series of specifications for IPTV (internet protocol television) services. In both cases it is used to develop interactive applications to digital television. Structure of an NCL document NCL was designed to be modular to allow for use of subsets of modules according to the needs of the particular application.

The crown is broad conic; both the main branches and the side branches are level, the side branches only rarely drooping. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically 10‚Äì50 cm long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only 1‚Äì2 mm long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light glaucous green, 2‚Äì5 cm long; they turn bright yellow to orange before they fall in the autumn, leaving the pinkish-brown shoots bare until the next spring. The cones are erect, ovoid-conic and 2‚Äì3.5 cm long, with 30‚Äì50 reflexed seed scales; they are green when immature, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 4‚Äì6 months after pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning dull grey- black. It grows at altitudes up to 2,900 m on well-drained soils, avoiding waterlogged ground. The scientific name honours Engelbert Kaempfer. It is also sometimes known by the synonym Larix leptolepis.

From 1892 to 1897 he explored and named the Mount Goddard, Evolution Valley and Evolution Basin region in what is now northern Kings Canyon National Park in eastern California. He was instrumental in envisioning, exploring, and establishing the route of what became the John Muir Trail from Yosemite Valley along the crest of the Sierra Nevada to Mount Whitney Biography =Early life and ancestors= He was born in San Francisco, California on July 20, 1870, the second son and the fifth of seven childrenSelina (b. 1862) became a writer and advocate for woman suffrage; Lucius Levy (b. 1863) became a lawyer and public speaker; Gertrude Marks (b. 1866) died at a young age; Adele Rosa (b. 1868) became a doctor; Leon Mendes (b. 1873) became a scholar; Frank Benjamin (b. 1875) died as an infant. of Hannah Marks, an influential San Francisco educator and civic worker and Gershom Mendes Seixas Solomons.His cousin was the poet Emma Lazarus (1849‚Äì1887), known for her verses inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. He was also related to Benjamin N. Cardozo, Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court. He had relocated to San Francisco from New York City during the Gold Rush, and founded Congregation Emanu-El in 1854. He was also the first president of any West Coast lodge of B'nai B'rith. His great-grandfather was Gershom Mendes Seixas (1745‚Äì1816), the \\"Patriot Rabbi\\", the first native-born Rabbi in the United States.He was one of the fourteen recognized ministers in New York in 1789, participating in George Washington's first inauguration. He was also one of the incorporators of Columbia University and served as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. Solomons later recalled that the idea that resulted in the John Muir Trail originated in his adolescence. \\"The idea of a crest-parallel trail came to me one day while herding my uncle's cattle in an immense unfenced alfalfa field near Fresno. It was 1884 and I was 14.\\" =Marriage and family= Solomons married three times. He married as his first wife, on March 29, 1901, at Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Canada, Rozella M. Gould of Dawson Creek. They were later divorced. There were no children from this marriage. He married on January 8, 1909, in New York City, as his second wife, Katherine Gray Church, born on May 6, 1881 in New York City the only daughter of Henry Seymour Church and Margaretta Josephine Gray. She died on February 7, 1971 in Cherryland, Alameda County, California.Raymond, Marcius D., p. 64Jordan, 372Katherine's stepfather was Albert J. Bothwell, a wealthy cattle baron and founder of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and considered, by some, to be the main instigator of the infamous Wyoming Johnson County War. Her mother, a published writer and singer, was born into a family with deep New England roots that trace back to the Rev. Mr. Blackleach Burritt,Dexter, pp. 103-105Raymond, Marcius D., pp. 32 and Governor Thomas Welles. After his second wife was committed to a mental institution, he married Yvonne Robinson who died in 1965. They had no children. Theodore and Katherine were the parents of three children: Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony \\"Toni\\" Solomons (1911‚Äì2006),An unusually gifted student, Toni scored so high on intelligence tests that she was selected for a lifelong research project known as the Terman Genetic Studies of Genius. The study was started by Lewis Terman at Stanford University. After marrying and divorcing Benjamin O. Jackson, she began a relationship with Ed Ricketts in 1940 and became his common-law wife. Toni, who had attended the University of California, Los Angeles, later worked as a personal assistant for Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning writer John Steinbeck and was the editor of The Log from the Sea of Cortez. Beside Steinbeck, their circle of friends also included the writer and painter, Henry Miller and the mythologist, writer, and lecturer Joseph Campbell. She left Ricketts after the death of her daughter (by her first husband) Katherine Adele Jackson. She died on October 5, 1947 at the age of 12 of a brain tumor and only five months after the death of her father. She later married Benjamin Elazari Volcani. David Seixas Solomons (1913‚Äì1961), and Leon Henry Solomons (1915‚Äì1988). Eleanor was married to Israeli biologist Benjamin Elazari Volcani. They lived at a house he named the Flying Spur, which he built on of land that juts out over the Merced River Canyon. It is located at in the Stanislaus National Forest adjacent to Yosemite National Park. Explorations In his explorations, Solomons correctly determined the courses of the upper branches of the San Joaquin River. In 1892, accompanied by Joseph Nisbet LeConte and Sidney I. Peixotto, he crossed from Mount Lyell by way of Rush Creek to the base of Mount Ritter and ascended the peak. In 1895, Solomons took his most notable trip, accompanied by Ernest C. Bonner. Ascending the South Fork of the San Joaquin they came to the group of mountains now designated the Evolution Group, named by Solomons. The highest of these he called Mount Darwin (after the evolutionist Charles Darwin), and the others he named Haeckel, Wallace, Fiske, Spencer, and Huxley, after famous evolutionists of the day. Continuing their explorations, Solomons and Bonner ascended Mount Goddard, then made their way down to Simpson Meadow via North Goddard Creek, and were the first to make this section known. Solomons‚Äô excursions in the next two years added details to the knowledge of Sierra topography, but his principal contribution was an accurate map which he drafted and presented to the Sierra Club in 1896. Death and memorials He died in Los Angeles, California on May 27, 1947. Mount Solomons (13016') is named after him as well as the long-distance trail the Theodore Solomons Trail.

He made numerous television and film appearances over a 30-year period and is perhaps best remembered for his roles as Harris in Porridge, Gestapo agent Major Arnold Ernst Toht in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Bishop of Bath and Wells in Blackadder II. Early life Lacey was born and grew up in Harrow, Middlesex. He received his formal education at Harrow Weald Grammar School. After a brief stint of national service in the British Armed Forces, he enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to train as an actor. Career He began his acting career in 1959 in a television play, The Secret Agent. His first notable performance was at the Royal Court Theatre in 1962's Chips with Everything. Lacey had an unusual 'pug' look, with beady eyes, an upturned nose, liver lips, an overbite, receding chin and no brows. He had a distinctive voice as well, and could scream at a very high pitch. This unique combination of features landed him repeatedly in bizarre roles on both stage and screen, often as seedy, creepy villains. Together with his Welsh background, it helped qualify him for the role of Dylan Thomas, which he played on BBC2 in what critic Clive James described as a \\"bravura performance\\". Lacey performed on British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with roles spanning from a part in Kenneth Clark's Civilisation television series, as the gravedigger, in a re-enactment of the gravedigger scene from Hamlet, with Ian Richardson as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Horatio, to a guest shot as the \\"Strange Young Man\\" in The Avengers episode \\"The Joker\\", and as Harris in the sitcom Porridge, with the latter finally landing him in the role for which his unusual physical characteristics could be repeatedly used to full advantage. Disappointed with his acting career by the late 1970s, he began to consider starting a talent agency. Spielberg then cast him as the Nazi agent Arnold Toht in Raiders of the Lost Ark. He followed this with a series of various villain roles for the next five to six years: Sahara with Brooke Shields, and 1985's Red Sonja with Arnold Schwarzenegger, in addition to 1982's Firefox with Clint Eastwood, in which he played a Russian scientist helping the West behind the Iron Curtain. He then made two movies for Ice International Films: Assassinator starring alongside John Ryan and George Murcell, and Into the Darkness, starring with Donald Pleasence, John Ryan, and Brett Paul. Lacey played a number of villainous roles and was known for his trademark smile, which would turn into a gleaming malicious leer. He also had a rather large mole on his left cheek, which he chose not to have removed, as well as a highly distinctive voice. In 1983's Trenchcoat, he used the mole as a beauty mark in his role as Princess Aida, a mysterious and sleazy drag queen on the island of Malta. His other drag role was in Invitation to the Wedding from 1985, in which he played a husband/wife couple. Death Lacey was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer on 25 April 1991. He died less than one month later, on 15 May 1991, at the age of 55. Personal life Lacey was known for his generosity and warmth to fans who occasionally recognised him from his film roles, but he was equally known in the London theatre scene for his excessive drinking habits, and he was a heavy cigarette smoker. He was often noted among the local gossip tabloid pages. He married twice, first to the actress Mela White in 1962 (she married him under the name Brompton as this was her second marriage), he became the father with her of two children, the actors Rebecca Lacey and Jonathan Lacey. After a turbulent divorce, he married Joanna Baker in 1972, the marriage producing a son.

It was first published in 1992 by Oxford University Press (OUP) and was edited by Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott. It is a widely used source of carols in among choirs and church congregations in Britain. The collection was published as a successor to the Oxford Book of Carols, originally published in 1928. This thoroughly documented text contains notes on sources, histories and variants of carols from a wide variety of sources; it is usable not only as a book for carol singing, but as a reference book as well. A Shorter New Oxford Book of Carols was issued in 1992, and other selections have been made. History The original Oxford Book of Carols was first published in 1928 by OUP. It was edited by Percy Dearmer, Martin Shaw and the noted composer and scholar of English folk-song Ralph Vaughan Williams. The book was highly influential as it introduced British choirs and church congregations (who were more accustomed to Victorian hymn tunes) to a form of Christmas music rooted in traditional folk music. The New Oxford Book of Carols started life as a recording tie-in project with Faber Music, consisting of a limited number of carols. Under the direction of OUP's senior editor Julian Elloway, the project grew beyond its initial concept to a published collection of 201 vocal pieces accompanied by a substantial body of historically informed arranging and editorial commentary. The volume contains two essays and each carol is accompanied by detailed annotations, and this supporting editorial material is considered to be a valuable resource for historians, church musicians and musicologists.

Pfeffer was dismissed from his SA command in 1930 and from the Nazi Party in 1941. He died in 1968. Biography Pfeffer von Salomon was born as the oldest of seven children. He was from a noble family of the Lower Rhine. He had studied law prior to starting a military career. He was a Prussian Army veteran of the First World War and also a Freikorps member. He gained his reputation by organizing resistance groups to put an end to the French occupation of the Ruhr (1923‚Äì25). He was Gauleiter in Upper Bavaria, and Heinrich Himmler was once his secretary. Adolf Hitler gave Pfeffer command of the Sturmabteilung (SA) after he swore unconditional loyalty to Hitler following the Bamberg Conference of 1926. He was the first SA commander upon its re-establishment in 1925, following its temporary abolition in 1923 after the abortive Beer Hall Putsch.Hitler was incarcerated in Landsberg until 20 December 1924 for his role in the November 1923 putsch. In early January 1925 he met Heinrich Held, the Bavarian Prime Minister, and promised that the Nazi Party had abandoned the strategy of seeking to overthrow the government by violent or unconstitutional means, and also that in future it would only seek power through lawful and constitutional means. In February 1925 the Bavarian bans on the Nazi Party and its organs (including the Nazi newspaper V√∂lkischer Beobachter and the SA) were lifted. See Toland chapter 4; Kershaw chapter 3. Pfeffer was dismissed from his command in 1930, following disagreements with Hitler about the role of the SA, and because he had failed to prevent his fellow SA leader Walter Stennes from leading an SA revolt in Berlin and thereby briefly occupying the Nazi Party's offices there. After Pfeffer's dismissal, Hitler assumed personal supreme command of the SA, but summoned Ernst R√∂hm to return to Germany from South America to run the SA as its first Stabschef (Chief of Staff), since Hitler had no interest in doing so himself. He was expelled from the Party on 14 November 1941. Pfeffer survived the Second World War and died in 1968. His brother, Friedrich Pfeffer von Salomon (1892‚Äì1961), was also a member in the SA and Nazi Party and served as the Gestapo leader in Kassel.

He was born in Odessa, then a part of Russia. He studied geology and zoology at the Novorossia University in Odessa. He then traveled across Russia and central Europe to collect fossil specimens. The Challenger expedition of 1872-1876 studied processes of the sea floor. In 1889 Andrusov published a review of this expedition in Gornyi zhurnal (Mining Journal). He would later perform studies of the geology and sediments of the Ponto-Caspian steppe. In 1890-91 he participated in a deep water expedition to the Black Sea by the Russian Geographical Society. This expedition discovered hydrogen sulfide in the lower portions of this sea. Andrusov was the first to propose that this substance was created by biological decomposition of life forms (bacteria) containing sulfurous compounds. He was married to Nadezhda Genrikhovna Schliemann in 1899, the daughter of the somewhat notorious archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann. In 1905 he became a professor at the University of Kiev. In 1914 he became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He emigrated to France in 1920 due to illness. In 1919 he learned about the death of his elder son, and suffered a stroke which resulted in paralysis of a leg and an arm. His relatives decided to move him to Paris, where he had an inheritance from his father-in-law. In 1922 he moved to Prague due to material difficulties, where he died in 1924. His son Dimitrij Andrusov became a notable geologist and a member of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

A conventional keyboard has, for instance, only one key and pitch for C and D, but an enharmonic keyboard would have two different keys and pitches for these notes. Traditionally, such keyboards use black split keys to express both notes,Jerkert 2010, p. 121: \\"The concept of enharmonicity arises from the fact that certain tone pairs seem to refer to almost identical pitches . For example, from a given C we... will find that the pitches of C and D are close to each other (exactly how close will depend on the methods we allow for finding them). C and D are obviously not identical, but they are close enough to be treated as identical in certain musical settings. Therefore, they are enharmonically equivalent. An enharmonic instrument is an instrument where multiple ways of producing enharmonically equivalent tones are available. For example, an enharmonic keyboard could have separate keys for C and D, as well as for each tone in other enharmonic pairs such as D/E, F/G, G/A and A/B. An enharmonic keyboard is thus guaranteed to have more than 12 keys per octave\\"Rasch 2009, p. 61: \\"Enharmonic instruments should be understood as musical instruments presenting a number of pitches per octave that significantly surpasses the twelve notes of the standard western tuning systems (equal temperament, meantone tuning or whatever). This begins with harpsichords or organs with a few split upper keys, goes to keyboards with 17, 19, 31 or 43 notes per octave and ends with theoretical systems and ideas for instruments (less often the instruments themselves) up to far over 100 pitches per octave\\" but diatonic white keys may also be split.Jerkert 2010, p. 121: \\"Note, however, that the extra keys need not be found among the sharps and flats. On p. 20 in Barbieri's book, for example, an organ from the end of the 1400s is depicted with no extra black keys but with two E keys, one suitable for use in an E major chord, and another better fitted as the third in a C major chord\\" As an important device to compose, play and study enharmonic music,Rasch 2009, p. 61: \\"Enharmonic music is music... that is mostly to be found in the surroundings of enharmonic instruments. Without those instruments nearby, it makes little sense to produce such music\\" enharmonic keyboards are capable of producing microtones and have separate keys for at least some pairs of not equal pitches that must be enharmonically equal in conventional keyboard instruments.HDM 2003, p. 295  The term (divergence of scholar opinions)  \\"Enharmonic keyboard\\" is a term used by scholars in their studies of enharmonic keyboard instruments (organ, harpsichord, piano,Tukhmanova 2005, pp. 23‚Äì26 harmonium and synthesizer) with reference to a keyboard with more than 12 keys per octave. Scholarly consensus about the term's precise definition currently has not been established. In the New Grove Dictionary (2001) Nicolas Mee√πs defines an \\"enharmonic keyboard\\" as \\"a keyboard with more than 12 keys and sounding more than 12 different pitches in the octave\\".Mee√πs, Nicolas, 2001. \\"Enharmonic keyboard\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell, accessed Oct. 12, 2012. He however does not specify the origin of the term in his article. Rudolph Rasch (2002) suggested to apply the term \\"enharmonic keyboard\\" more closely to keyboards with 29‚Äì31 keys per octave.Rasch 2002 Patrizio Barbieri (2007), in his turn, raised objection that this usage is not supported by early theoretical works.Barbieri, Patrizio. Pietro della Valle: the Esth√®r oratorio (1639) and other experiments in the \\"stylus metabolicus\\" (with new documents on triharmonic instruments). In: Recercare XIX/1-2 2007. The only theoretical evidence that agrees with Rasch's usage is found in one (not yet published) manuscript by some Benedetto Bresciani, written ca. 1719. As for historical evidence, confusion has often reigned over the terminology of split-keyed instruments, which were called sometimes 'chromatic', sometimes 'enharmonic'. The builders (or persons who only projected the construction) of such keyboard instruments often gave them names without any reference to genus, like 'archicembalo' (Nicola Vicentino), 'cembalo pentarmonico' (Giovanni Battista Doni), 'Clavicymbalum universale' (Michael Praetorius) or even simply 'Clauocembalo' (that is clavicembalo; Gioseffo ZarlinoLe istitutioni harmoniche, 1558Burundukovskaya 2008, p. 185: \\"In 1548 Dominicus Pizaurensis has built harpsichord with 19 divisions of the octave by the order and description of G. Zarlino <...> the earliest enarmonic instrument <...> manufacture date of which is known exactly ()\\"). Some modern scholars (Christopher Stembridge, Denzil Wraight) describe instruments with such keyboards as \\"split-keyed instruments\\".C.

Arthur von Oettingen's Orthotonophonium (Germany, 1914). 53EDO, 60 keys/octave One of the first instruments with an enharmonic keyboard was the archicembalo built by Nicola Vicentino, an Italian Renaissance composer and music theorist. The archicembalo had 36 keys per octave and was very well suited for meantone temperament.The best description of archicembalo along with recordings using the rebuilt instrument can be found in the book: There are many other descriptions of archicembalo given by modern scholars, e.g. in Christopher Stembridge, 'The Cimbalo Cromatico and Other Italian Keyboard Instruments with Nineteen or More Divisions to the Octave (Surviving Specimens and Documentary Evidence)' Performance Practice Review, 6:1 (1993), p.54 ff. Vicentino also had made one arciorgano in Rome and one arciorgano in Milan. Both pipe organs were equipped with enharmonic keyboards, like those of the archicembalo.Barbieri 2008, pp. 309‚Äì313 None of Vicentino's instruments survive. Many instruments with enharmonic keyboards were built during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Most composers and performers who used these instruments are virtually unknown today. Among them are Johann Kaspar Kerll's teacher, Giovanni Valentini, who played a harpsichord with 77 keys for 4 octaves (19 keys per octave plus one extra C), and Friedrich Suppig,Suppig 1722 published one of the definitive works for an instrument with an enharmonic keyboard: the Fantasia of the Labyrinthus Musicus, which is a multi-sectional composition that makes use of all 24 keys and is intended for a keyboard with 31 notes per octave and pure major thirds. With the advent of microtonal music in the 20th century, instruments with enharmonic keyboards became more fashionable, as did early and Baroque music for such instruments. For performance and recording purposes, either old instruments are reconstructed or two recordings of two differently tuned instruments are combined in one, thus creating an effect of an enharmonic keyboard. Isomorphic note-layouts are a class of enharmonic keyboard, opened in 1721 by Ivo Salzinger's Tastatura nova perfecta, Germany.Barbieri 2008, pp. 337‚Äì341 One isomorphic note-layout, the Wicki, when mapped to a hexagonal array of buttons, is particularly well-suited to the control of enharmonic scales. The orientation of its hexagonal columns of octaves and tempered perfect fifths place all the notes of every well-formed scale ‚Äì pentatonic (cardinality 5), diatonic (cardinality 7), chromatic (cardinality 12), and enharmonic (cardinality 19) ‚Äì in a tight, contiguous cluster. The notes of each progressively-higher cardinality are appended to the outer edges of the lower- cardinality scale, such that each well-formed scale's note-controlling buttons are embedded, unchanged, within the set of those controlling the higher- cardinality scales. Hence, the skills gained in learning to play chromatic music on a chromatic Wicki keyboard can be applied, without modification, to performance on an enharmonic Wicki keyboard. Isomorphic keyboards were not discovered until the latter half of the 19th century.

Machen was inspired to write The Great God Pan by his experiences at the ruins of a pagan temple in Wales. What would become the first chapter of the novella was published in the magazine The Whirlwind in 1890. Machen later extended The Great God Pan and it was published as a book alongside another story, \\"The Inmost Light\\", in 1894. The novella begins with an experiment to allow a woman named Mary to see the supernatural world. This is followed by an account of a series of mysterious happenings and deaths over many years surrounding a woman named Helen Vaughan. At the end, the heroes confront Helen and force her to kill herself. She undergoes a series of supernatural transformations before dying and she is revealed to be the child of Mary and the god Pan. On publication, it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate and horrific because of its implied sexual content, and the novella hurt Machen's reputation as an author. Beginning in the 1920s, Machen's work was critically re-evaluated and The Great God Pan has since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror. Literary critics have noted the influence of other nineteenth-century authors on The Great God Pan and offered differing opinions on whether or not it can be considered an example of Gothic fiction or science fiction. The novella has influenced the work of horror writers such as Bram Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft, and Stephen King, and has been adapted for the stage twice. Synopsis Clarke agrees, somewhat unwillingly, to bear witness to a strange experiment performed by his friend, Dr. Raymond. The ultimate goal of the doctor is to open the mind of someone so that he may experience the spiritual world, an experience he notes the ancients called \\"seeing the great god Pan\\". He performs the experiment, which involves minor brain surgery, on a young woman named Mary. She awakens from the operation awed and terrified but quickly becomes \\"a hopeless idiot\\". Years later, Clarke learns of a beautiful but sinister girl named Helen Vaughan, who is reported to have caused a series of mysterious happenings in her town. She spends much of her time in the woods near her house, and takes other children on prolonged twilight rambles in the countryside that disturb the parents of the town. One day, a young boy stumbles across her \\"playing on the grass with a 'strange naked man,\\"; the boy becomes hysterical and later, after seeing a Roman statue of a satyr's head, becomes permanently feeble-minded. Helen also forms an unusually close friendship with a neighbour girl, Rachel, whom she leads several times into the woods. On one occasion Rachel returns home distraught, half-naked and rambling. Shortly after explaining to her mother what happened to her (never revealed in the story), Rachel returns to the woods and disappears forever. Clarke relates these events in a book he is writing entitled Memoirs to Prove the Existence of the Devil. Years later, Villiers happens across his old friend Herbert, who has become a vagrant since they last met. When asked how he has fallen so low, Herbert replies that he has been \\"corrupted body and soul\\" by his wife. After some investigation with Clarke and another character, Austin, it is revealed that Helen was Herbert's wife, and that a well-to-do man died \\"of fright, of sheer, awful terror\\" after seeing something in Herbert and Helen's home. Herbert is later found dead. Helen disappears for some time; according to rumor, she spent the time taking part in disturbing orgies somewhere in the Americas. She eventually returns to London under the pseudonym Mrs. Beaumont. Soon after, a group of stable, happy men in London commit suicide; the last person known to have been in the presence of each of them was Mrs. Beaumont, whom they are implied to have slept with. Villiers and Clarke, each learning of Mrs. Beaumont's true identity, band together and confront Helen in her house with a noose. They tell her that she must kill herself, or they will expose her. Helen has a very abnormal death, transforming between human and beast, male and female, and dividing and reuniting, before turning into a jelly-like substance and finally dying. This is followed by a fragment of a document about the remains of a pillar honoring the Celtic god Nodens. The Latin inscription on the column reads, \\"To the great god Nodens (the god of the Great Deep or Abyss), Flavius Senilis has erected this pillar on account of the marriage which he saw beneath the shade.\\" The document says that historians are puzzled as to what the inscription refers to. The novella ends with a fragment of a letter from Dr. Raymond to Clarke, which reveals that Helen was the child of Mary, who died shortly after her daughter's birth. In the letter, Raymond informs Clarke that Mary became pregnant after his experiment caused her to see the god Pan, implying that Pan fathered Helen. Background Arthur Machen credited his childhood visits to the ruined Roman temple at Caerwent (pictured), which he believed was dedicated to the god Nodens, as his inspiration for The Great God Pan. Machen's lifelong fascination with occultism began after he read an article on alchemy in an edition of Charles Dickens's periodical Household Words belonging to his father, a clergyman. In his 1922 autobiography, Far Off Things, Machen wrote that The Great God Pan was inspired by the times he visited the Usk, a Welsh river, and the Welsh towns of Caerleon on the Usk and Caerwent as a boy; all of these places had been settled by the Romans. He wrote that \\"strange relics\\" were frequently found at Caerwent from the ruined temple of \\"Nodens, god of the depths\\". Machen visited the temple, which he described as a \\"lonely house between the dark forest and the silver river\\". In writing the novella, he tried to \\"pass on the vague, indefinable sense of awe and mystery and terror that [he] had received\\" while visiting those ruins. Machen felt that he had \\"transliterated [the feeling] clumsily\\" in The Great God Pan, elaborating: \\"I translated awe, at worst awfulness, into evil; again, I say, one dreams with fire and works in clay.\\" Dennis Denisoff said that Machen's decision to make Helen Vaughan the child of a Welsh woman and a pagan figure \\"parallels Machen's own authorial self-identity as one arising from not only his Welsh ancestry but also pagan myth.\\" What is now the first chapter of the novella was published in 1890 in a magazine called The Whirlwind, while what is now the third chapter of the book was published in the same magazine the following year as a standalone short story called \\"The City of Resurrections\\". Machen only viewed the two works as connected after they were finished. Once he decided the two stories were connected, Machen wrote the rest of The Great God Pan in a single evening save for its final chapter. Machen did not think of an ending for the tale for months, and in that time believed that the novella would remain unfinished forever. The last chapter was completed in June 1891. Machen sent the novella to the publisher Blackwood, who rejected it, deeming it a clever story that \\"shrink[s]...from the central idea.\\" It was accepted by John Lane and published in 1894. When published as a book, The Great God Pan was accompanied by another Machen tale called \\"The Inmost Light\\" which also features a mad scientist and elements of science fiction. The book's cover was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley. Analysis =Genre= Joe Sommerlad of The Independent views The Great God Pan as a work of Gothic horror. According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, the story is \\"typical of Victorian [science fiction] horror at about the time [science fiction] was beginning to shed its Gothic elements into a separate Horror/fantasy genre.\\" Aaron Worth writes that The Great God Pan superficially resembles science fiction due to its depiction of Dr. Raymond as a mad scientist, but it cannot be seen as an example of the genre as it posits that occultism is superior to science. The novella has been classified as Decadent literature as well, as it features hallmarks of the genre such as \\"occultism, paganism, non-mainstream eroticism, sexual diversity, the femme fatale, violent and strange deaths, and the simultaneous investment in and disavowal of bourgeois identities.\\" Pan has also been described as fantasy literature and as a cautionary tale against men mistreating women the way that Raymond mistreated Mary. =Influences= Roman sarcophagus showing Pan dancing with a maenad (\\"mad woman\\") playing a tambourine Pan was an ancient Greek god primarily worshipped in Arcadia who was associated with shepherds and their flocks, and with nature. He was believed to lurk in caves, mountains, and other lonely, isolated locations. In some stories, he inflicted his enemies with sudden terror (i.e. panic). The phrase, \\"the great God Pan\\" comes from an ancient Greek folktale recorded in Plutarch's De defectu oraculorum (On the Decline of Oracles), which claims that a Greek sailor near the island of Paxi during the reign of Emperor Tiberius (ruled 14‚Äì37 AD) heard a voice cry out, \\"When you are arrived at Palodes, take care to make it known that the great God Pan is dead.\\"Plutarch, Moralia, De defectu oraculorum 17 Early Christian commentaries suggested that this event occurred at the same time as the death of Christ and that the \\"death\\" of Pan represented the transition from a pagan to a Christian world. This story had particular resonance with Victorian literary audiences. In 1844, Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote her poem \\"The Dead Pan\\", an adaption of Plutarch's story which insisted that proper Christian literature should abandon Greek mythology, with each stanza ending in the words \\"Pan, Pan is dead.\\" As a member of the Decadent movement, Machen sought to subvert traditional themes and transgress literary boundaries, an agenda which made Pan a particularly appealing figure. The title of The Great God Pan appears to have been specifically derived from Browning's later poem \\"A Musical Instrument\\" (1862), in which the first line of every stanza ends with the words \\"the great god Pan\\". Machen's use of Pan in the novella may have also been influenced by Robert Louis Stevenson's essay \\"Pan's Pipes\\" (1878) and Algernon Charles Swinburne's poem \\"A Nympholept\\" (1894), in which Pan is portrayed as the \\"emblem of the delicious combination of ecstasy and terror.\\" In a review of the novella for Black Gate, Matthew David Surridge hypothesized that Machen took inspiration from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) in his portrayal of Dr. Raymond as a mad scientist akin to Victor Frankenstein. The works of Robert Louis Stevenson, especially his 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, were among Machen's most significant influences when writing The Great God Pan. Critic John Gawsworth also sees Machen's novella as reminiscent of the horror stories of Edgar Allan Poe and Sheridan Le Fanu. Aaron Worth noted similitude between the death of Helen Vaughan and the theories of alchemist Thomas Vaughan, who is the character's namesake and Helen's disintegration recalls the alchemical concept of the prima materia. John C. Tibbetts observes similarities between Helen Vaughan and Ayesha, the sexually liberated demonic priestess from H. Rider Haggard's She: A History of Adventure (1886). Machen wrote that several critics felt that Joris-Karl Huysmans's novels √Ä rebours (1884) and L√†-bas (1891) had inspired The Great God Pan, though he did not read either book until after Pan was published. Upon reading the two novels, Machen concluded that \\"my critics had not read them either.\\" =Religious themes= Helen Vaughan and Pan have respectively been compared to the Antichrist (left) and Lucifer (right). The novella is characteristic of a late nineteenth-century interest in paganism in general and Pan in particular that is found in the works of Florence Farr and Kenneth Grahame. According to the British scholar of modern literature Roger Luckhurst, Raymond expresses a typical Neoplatonist view of reality in which the true object of study is the revelation of a \\"higher, hidden spiritual world\\". He is therefore \\"an occultist rather than a materialist scientist.\\" Neoplatonism is also commonly regarded as the last school of pagan philosophy and Raymond's views therefore relate back to the recurring theme of the death of Pan. Author Theodora Goss sees The Great God Pan as equating paganism with irrationality and what Carl Jung would call the collective unconscious. Literary critic Kostas Boyiopoulos reads the story from a Judeo-Christian perspective, arguing that Helen Vaughan embodies a \\"female version of an antichrist\\", a perversion of Jesus, as well as the figure of Lilith from Judaic myth, with Helen's mother Mary being a \\"direct analogy of the biblical Virgin Mary\\". Black Gates Matthew David Surridge believes that the story associates paganism with sex and femininity, while portraying Helen as a female Antichrist, a view shared by James Goho in Journeys into Darkness: Critical Essays on Gothic Horror (2014). Surridge adds \\"from another perspective: [Helen] is the undoing of progress. Rather than proceeding from paganism to Christianity, as orthodox Victorian belief imagined the progress of history, she is a reversal of time, the revenge of the atavistic.\\" In keeping with this idea, Surridge sees Mary's name as a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus and Helen's name as a reference to the pagan figure Helen of Troy. Goho interprets the story as Machen's warning against the abandonment of \\"true religion\\" and the embrace of paganism. At one point in the novella, a Latin creed is recited: \\"Et Diabolus Incarnatus Est. Et Homo Factus Est.\\" (\\"And the Devil was made incarnate. And was made man.\\") Luckhurst identifies this as a blasphemous rewriting of the Nicene Creed, an early Christian creed which includes the line: \\"By the power of the Holy Spirit he [Jesus] became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man.\\" Goho writes that the portrayal of Pan in the novella draws on the mythology of Lucifer and depictions of Pan as \\"the fetish for evil and suffering and the danger and dread of the wilderness,\\" rather than depictions of Pan as a playful and harmless god. Surridge sees the book's references to Satan and Nodens as implying that Satan, Nodens and Pan are the same being, while Goho connects the novella to the fact that early Christians associated Pan with the devil. Critical reception Oscar Wilde praised the novella. The Great God Pan implied sexuality caused a scandal upon its original release and hurt Machen's reputation as an author. Reviewing the novella for the magazine Literary News, Richard Henry Stoddard criticised the story as \\"too morbid to be the production of a healthy mind\\".Richard Henry Stoddard, \\"Review of \\"The Great God Pan\\"\\", in: Colavito, Jason, ed. A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008. p. 228-230) The art critic Harry Quilter's review of the book, titled \\"The Gospel of Intensity\\", and published in The Contemporary Review in June 1895, was even more harsh. Quilter declared: \\"The Great God Pan' is, I have no hesitation in saying, a perfectly abominable story, in which the author has spared no endeavor to suggest loathsomeness and horror which he describes as beyond the reach of words.\\"Harry Quilter, \\"The Gospel of Intensity\\", in Colavito, ed. A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I. Jefferson,NC: McFarland, 2008. (p. 230-254). Quilter warned that Machen's books were a dangerous threat to the entire British public and that they would destroy readers' sanities and senses of morality. Quilter went on to attack the story's publisher, John Lane, as well as Machen himself: \\"Why should he be allowed, for the sake of a few miserable pounds, to cast into our midst these monstrous creations of his diseased brain?\\" Quilter added that works of fiction like Machen's should be unanimously condemned by literary critics and newspapers: \\"If the Press was so disposed it could stamp out such art and fiction in a few months: And that disposition must be acquired, must even be enforced.\\" He was particularly harsh in his denunciation of sexual ambiguity and polymorphous androgyny in the book. He expressed revulsion at Machen's description of Helen's sex changing immediately before her death and concluded his review with a comment of distaste regarding the \\"nasty little naked figure of dubious sex and humanity with which Mr. Aubrey Beardsley has prefaced the story\\". A positive appraisal of the novella came from Oscar Wilde, who called it \\"un succ√®s fou.\\" Machen's literary reputation was re-evaluated in the 1920s and The Great God Pan has since attained the reputation of a horror masterpiece. In \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" (1926; revised 1933), H. P. Lovecraft praised the story, saying: \\"No one could begin to describe the cumulative suspense and ultimate horror with which every paragraph abounds\\"; he added that \\"the sensitive reader\\" reaches the end with \\"an appreciative shudder\\". Lovecraft also noted, however, that \\"melodrama is undeniably present, and coincidence is stretched to a length which appears absurd upon analysis\\". Bennett Cerf described the story as a \\"masterpiece\\".\\"Arthur Machen, celebrated English author of such masterpieces as \\"The Great God Pan\\" and \\"The Hill of Dreams\\"...\\" Bennett Cerf, \\"Trade Winds\\", The Saturday Review of Literature, March 20, 1943, (p. 26). Brian Stableford stated that The Great God Pan is \\"the archetypal Decadent horror story\\" and described the story as \\"highly original\\".Stableford, Brian, (1998). \\"Machen, Arthur (Llewellyn)\\". St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers, ed. David Pringle. London: St. James Press. . Stephen King referred to it as \\"one of the best horror stories ever written. Maybe the best in the English language.\\"King, Stephen, \\"Self-Interview \\", 10:50 am, September 4, 2008. StephenKing.com. Retrieved April 24, 2017.] The Washington Post Elizabeth Hand deemed it \\"one of the greatest supernatural tales ever written\\". Black Gate Matthew David Surridge said that The Great God Pan is \\"a fascinating, troubling story, and, for all its influence, not like much else than I can think of. It's not simple, and yet it's effective, more so than can easily be explained.\\" Some commentary on The Great God Pan has focused on its portrayal of women. Surridge sees the novella as expressing a fear of women even though the ultimate source of horror in the story is a male deity. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says that Helen's \\"metamorphosis...remains one of the most dramatically horrible and misogynistic in fiction\\". Helen never speaks in the book; according to Victoria Margree and Bryony Randall in Victorian Gothic: An Edinburgh Companion, \\"The silence of the central female character is part of the text's misogyny, but also part of its narrative effect.\\" Margree and Randall also view Helen's fate as a punishment for her sexual impropriety. Dennis Denisoff connects Machen's tendency to make his empowered female characters \\"sexually monstrous\\" to his criticisms of authors who discussed the subject of women's rights. James Machin defends Machen and The Great God Pan from charges from misogyny on the grounds that the male protagonist of Machen's story \\"The Novel of the White Powder\\" (1895) disintegrates in a manner reminiscent of Helen Vaughan and on the grounds that Machen married Amy Hogg, a woman who defied the sexual boundaries of her time. Adaptations A pair of parodies of Pan were published in 1895 ‚Äì Arthur Rickett's \\"A Yellow Creeper\\" and Arthur Sykes's \\"The Great Pan-Demon\\". Both suggest that Machen is an author of \\"limited imagination,\\" with the latter depicting him as a mad scientist unleashing degenerate literature on an unsuspecting public. The Great God Pan was brought to the stage in 2008 by the WildClaw Theatre Company in Chicago. It was adapted and directed by WildClaw artistic director Charley Sherman.The Great God Pan. WildClaw Theatre. Retrieved October 18, 2016. The novella Helen's Story (2013) by Rosanne Rabinowitz retells the story of The Great God Pan from Helen Vaughan's point of view. Helen's Story was written from a feminist perspective and nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award.\\"Rosanne Rabinowitz ... in her Shirley Jackson award nominated novella Helen's Story, which examined the decidedly problematic story of Helen Vaughan and The Great God Pan from a feminist viewpoint ...\\" Rucker, Lynda E.(Nov.‚ÄìDec. 2014). Black Static Magazine. p. 7. The Great God Pan was adapted into a chamber opera by composer Ross Crean. Unusually for a composer, Crean wrote the opera's libretto himself. A recording of the work was released in 2017. The production saw its world premiere by Chicago Fringe Opera in 2018. According to the Chicago Tribune John von Rhein, Chicago Fringe Opera's staging of The Great God Pan portrays Helen Vaughan as both a symbol of gender equality and an evil femme fatale. Legacy The Great God Pan influenced later works of horror fiction, including \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" (1929) by H. P. Lovecraft. Black Gate Matthew David Surridge said that The Great God Pan influenced Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) as both works feature \\"an introductory sequence featuring a horrified Englishman in a non-English setting; then a variety of seemingly- unconnected events in London, the metropole at the heart of Empire; then the discovery that all those events are in fact inspired by one malign and supernatural intelligence, that the rational contemporary capital is threatened by the irrational and archaic; then an equivocal conclusion. The fear of sex, women, foreignness.\\" John C. Tibbetts notes that both Helen Vaughan in The Great God Pan and Lucy Westenra in Dracula are \\"demon women of voracious and malignant sexuality\\". Theodora Goss also notes similarities between the death of Helen Vaughan in Machen's novella and Lucy's death in Dracula. Tibbetts also notes that Machen's portrayal of Helen Vaughan as demonic and hyper-sexual may have influenced a similar character, The Woman of Songs, in Richard Marsh's The Beetle (1897). The Great God Pan was highly influential on the circle of writers around H. P. Lovecraft. The structure of Machen's story influenced the structure of Lovecraft's \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" (1928). Pans depiction of a monstrous half-human hybrid inspired the plot of Lovecraft‚Äôs \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" (1929), which refers to Machen‚Äôs novella by name. According to Lovecraft scholar Robert M. Price, \\"The Dunwich Horror' is in every sense an homage to Machen and even a pastiche. There is little in Lovecraft's wonderful story that does not come directly out of Machen's fiction.\\" Pan also inspired Lovecraft to create his character Nodens who appears most prominently in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1943). Clark Ashton Smith was inspired by The Great God Pan to write his story \\"The Nameless Offspring\\" (1931), which also features a monstrous child born of a human and a supernatural entity.\\"Pan' ... has suggested to me an idea so hellish that I am almost afraid to work it out in story form ...[a woman] gives birth to a child and dies.

London: British Library. pp. 35‚Äì6. . The Great God Pan influenced Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story (1979) in its depiction of a shapeshifting monster who terrifies those it encounters. Straub himself frequently credited The Great God Pan as having been a major influence on his work. According to film historians Keith McDonald and Roger Clark, Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro's portrayal of the faun in his 2006 dark fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth was inspired by the \\"ambivalent and possibly dangerous\\" portrayals of Pan in late Victorian and early Edwardian novels, including Machen's The Great God Pan and Pan's Garden (1912) by Algernon Blackwood. Del Toro deliberately chose to imitate the darker, more sinister fauns of Machen and Blackwood rather than the \\"sweetly domesticated figure\\" of Mr. Tumnus from C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950). The original title of the film in Spanish is El Laberinto del Fauno (The Labyrinth of the Faun), but the English title Pan's Labyrinth emphasizes the connection between del Toro's film and the body of late nineteenth-century writings about Pan, including The Great God Pan. Stephen King wrote that his novella N. from his story collection Just After Sunset (2008) is \\"a riff on Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan.... Mine isn't anywhere near [as] good [as the original], but I loved the chance to put neurotic behavior‚Äîobsessive/compulsive disorder‚Äîtogether with the idea of a monster- filled macroverse.\\" King has also cited Machen's novella as an influence on his novel Revival (2014). Similar to Pan, Revival features an experiment on a young woman's brain which allows her to see into another world. Josh Malerman said The Great God Pan partly inspired his novel Bird Box (2014).

They were active from 1995 to 2003, though they have reunited for performances in the years since their disbandment. Formed in 1995, Twothirtyeight released three independently produced EP albums before signing with the now-defunct Takehold Records. In 1999, Twothirtyeight released their first full-length album Missing You Dearly on Takehold Records. The band line-up featured Chris Staples, Kevin Woerner, Owen Grabo, and DJ Stone. The album was dedicated to Kevin Glass, the band's former bass guitarist, who died in a tragic car accident in 1997. Weeks before Glass was killed, he taught Owen Grabo the bass parts for most of the songs in the band's catalogue. In 2000, with Owen Grabo having left the band, Twothirtyeight recorded their next EP, Matter Has a Breaking Point, as a three-piece outfit with Chris Staples on bass guitar and lead vocals. With the addition of Jake Brown, former frontman of the band Driven, on bass guitar, Twothirtyeight wrote and recorded their second full- length album Regulate the Chemicals. Chris Carrabba, notable as the former lead vocalist of Further Seems Forever and principal artist of Dashboard Confessional, contributed backing vocals to two of the songs from Regulate the Chemicals, \\"This Town Will Eat You\\" and \\"Coin Laundry Loser.\\" Following the album's release DJ Stone, who had played drums for the group since the beginning, left the group to focus on his family. Regulate the Chemicals was released on Takehold Records and followed by a summer of extensive touring. In January 2001, Jake Brown left the band. In 2002, Takehold was acquired by Tooth & Nail Records, and the record label would re-release the band's second album, remastered with additional tracks added. You Should Be Living, was the group's final album. In April 2003, Twothirtyeight officially disbanded. Lead vocalist Chris Staples went on to front the indie rock band Discover America and embarked on a solo career. On April 17, 2012, Chris Staples announced via his official Facebook page that Twothirtyeight would be reuniting to play the Deluna Festival in Pensacola, Florida, which took place September 21 to 23, 2012. The band fully reunited on September 21 to play a show in Atlanta, followed by an appearance at Deluna Festival on the 23rd, and a special-late night show in Pensacola the same night.

The name was used from 2006 for those parts of the United Kingdom and German services businesses of Marconi Corporation (formerly General Electric Company, GEC) which had not been acquired by Ericsson. Companies with Marconi in their name can trace their ultimate origins, through mergers and takeovers, to The Marconi Company Ltd, founded by Guglielmo Marconi in 1897 as The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company.  History  The company's predecessor was formed in September 1961 as GEC Telecommunications Limited, a division of the GEC conglomerate. In 1988 the division became part of the GEC Plessey Telecommunications joint venture, and following the breakup of GPT during the 1990s it was renamed Marconi Communications Limited in 1998, when GEC decided to switch to use the better known Marconi brand name which it had owned for some time. In January 2006, following Ericsson's acquisition of most Marconi assets, including the rights to the Marconi name, the remaining UK and German services business of Marconi Corporation which was not acquired and no longer had the rights to use the Marconi name was renamed Telent. In May 2007, Telent announced its move from Coventry to Warwick's Opus 40 business park. In November 2007 Telent, which had inherited GEC's ¬£2.5 billion pension scheme with several tens of thousands of members, was purchased by Pension Corporation for ¬£400 million; the following month its shares were delisted and Telent became a private company. In 2008 Telent made various acquisitions, including intelligent traffic systems group TSEU in March, leading communications infrastructure provider, the Alan Campbell Group, in July and telecoms service provider Premises Networks in September. In September 2019 the pension scheme, described by Telent as a \\"disproportionately large liability\\", was bought out by Rothesay Life. In September 2020, it was announced that Telent were awarded a contract with Openreach to support a ¬£12 billion project for the UK's largest ultrafast broadband build, which would bring 'Full Fibre' broadband to thousands of homes and businesses. Operations The company provides a range of network and communications services to industries including Rail, Traffic, Public Safety, Defence, Service Providers, Enterprise and Public Sector. Products include enterprise software systems, emergency services communications and logistics, integrated warehouse logistics systems and rail and metro systems. Customers include BAE Systems, BT, Highways England, HM Coastguard, Interoute, London Ambulance Service, Merseyside Fire & Rescue, Metropolitan Police, Network Rail, RNLI, Sky, Transport for London, Virgin Media and Vodafone. The company has many operational sites within the UK and Ireland, including at Chorley in Lancashire, Warwick, Camberley in Surrey, Harbour Exchange in London, and Dublin. A team of telecommunications technicians and engineers provide support and new features development for the TDM System X network used by BT, Virgin Media, Kingston Communications, Vodafone, and Gibtelecom.  People  From its formation in 2006, Telent's CEO was Mark Plato. He died in a motorcycle accident in September 2019. Non-executive director Frank McKay, former CEO of Travis Perkins and Brakes Group, was appointed as his temporary replacement and was succeeded in July 2020 by Jo Gretton, a Telent executive since 2006.

He was a pioneering white owner of a minstrel troupe composed of black members, and the success he saw with this troupe inspired many other white minstrel managers to tour with black companies. Hague was born in Sheffield, England in 1828 and in his youth launched a career as a clog dancer. In 1850, he moved with his brothers Tom and William to America, where they toured as the Brothers Hague Concert Party. He went on to partner two other renowned cloggers, Dublin-born Tim Hayes and fellow Yorkshireman Dick Sands, in the leading minstrel and variety theaters. He co-managed Wagner and Hague's Pontoon Minstrels, touring the western states, then briefly retired from show business in 1866, opening the Champion Shades bar with his brother Tom opposite the Mechanics Hall theater in Utica, New York. A visit to Utica by W.H. Lee's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, a company made up of genuinely black minstrels, inspired Hague to purchase the group and launch a tour of England. Hague's troupe, which included variety star Japanese Tommie, debuted at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool. The troupe was initially a failure in both Liverpool and on tour, but business picked up when Hague added white singers and instrumentalists, retaining only a few \\"colored\\" specialty performers. The successful combination began an 18-year career based at St. James's Hall, Liverpool.The New York Clipper, 20 January 1901. Sam Hague's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels included both white and black performers, though at each venue they put on separate all-white and all-black performances.Toll and Watkins In England, Hague eventually counted stars such as Bob Height and Charles Hicks among his troupers. Hague's overseas success lent black minstrelsy a new credibility in the United States, although at least one critic maintained their rise had damaged minstrelsy, and that white blackface minstrels were better at representing black Americans than black Americans were themselves.New York Times, May 9, 1897, 'THE OLD TIME MINSTREL: He Has Gone Out of Vogue, but the Public Recollects Him with Pleasure:...\\"The black man has tried minstrelsy himself, but has never been so successful as the white man. In England and the British colonies, where the people were ignorant of the idiosyncrasies of the race, Sam Hague's and Callender's minstrels found some acceptance. But in the United States the white man, beginning with T. D. Rice, has been the only recognized delineator of negro humor.\\" By the mid-1870s, most successful American black troupes had been bought by white owners who had followed Hague's lead. When the Slave Troupe returned to the United States, Charles Callender purchased the company. Five years after Hague sold the troupe, on an expedition to the Minstrel Troupe Owners Symposium in October 1879, he was introduced to his future wife, Clare Thiele. By 1881, Hague owned a white minstrel troupe composed of British players, Sam Hague's Operatic British Minstrels. The British had a reputation in America for not being as apt at portraying caricatured black roles or performing comedy bits. In response, Sam Hague's British Minstrels stressed their musical abilities and their refined costumes and sets. Only the endmen wore blackface, and the troupe did no base comedy. George Primrose and William H. West adopted Hague's idea and sparked a new trend in minstrelsy. The twice- married Hague died January 7, 1901 at home in Liverpool, leaving a wife and adopted daughter. Notes References *Toll, Robert C. (1974).

The waistline is the line of demarcation between the upper and lower portions of a garment, which notionally corresponds to the natural waist but may vary with fashion from just below the bust to below the hips. The waistline of a garment is often used to accentuate different features. The waistline is also important as a boundary at which shaping darts (such as those over the bust and in the back) can be ended. Types of waistlines Similar to necklines, waistlines may be grouped by their shape, depth, and location of the body. * None: The princess seams style of dress needs no waistline at all, since it does its shaping without darts, by joining edges of different curvature. The resulting \\"princess seams\\" typically run vertically from the shoulder (or under the arm) over the bust point and down to the lower hem. This creates a long, slimming look, often seen in dresses with an \\"A-line\\" silhouette. * Diagonal: An asymmetrical waistline that runs across the body diagonally. Usually the highest point is below the natural waistline. * Drop waist: A low, horizontal waistline that usually falls near the level of the upper hips. Balances the upper and lower bodies, and adds to the visual impression of height by lengthening the torso. Common in 1920s silhouettes. * Empire: A high waistline that cuts horizontally across the body, just below the bust.

The character is depicted as a villainous entrepreneur and a frequent adversary of the superhero Iron Man. As he explains in his first major appearance, he is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obliged to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark. Sam Rockwell portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 2 (2010), and the short film All Hail the King. Publication history Justin Hammer first appeared in Iron Man #120 (March 1979), and was created by David Michelinie, John Romita Jr., and Bob Layton. Layton himself recalled in a 2014 interview that he and Michelinie originally created Hammer as the cautionary tale of what kind of person Tony Stark might have become if he stayed on his path as a global war profiteer, as well as a tribute to actor Peter Cushing; in Layton's words, Stark and Hammer are essentially in the same line of work, but with diametrically opposed moral views. Fictional character biography Justin Hammer was born in Surrey, England and later became a citizen of Monaco. A rival of industrialist Tony Stark (Iron Man), multi-billionaire businessman Hammer later became a criminal financier using unethical methods. In exchange for fifty percent of the crime profits, he would pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of both their weaponry and equipment. In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit (usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee Blacklash) to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment. At the start of the Demon in a Bottle storyline, Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.Iron Man #118, 120, 123 Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, he took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals (consisting of Beetle I, Constrictor, Discus, Leap-Frog, Man-Killer, Porcupine I, Stiletto, and Water Wizard) against Iron Man. Ultimately, Tony Stark not only cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but finally learned that a major enemy was behind multiple attacks on his interests for years.Iron Man #124‚Äì127 With help from the supervillain Force, Hammer next hijacked yachts to smuggle opium into the United States. They battled Iron Man and were defeated.Iron Man #140‚Äì141 When Stark lost his company to Obadiah Stane, Hammer left the destitute Stark to his own devices while continuing with his own enterprises. When Stark recovered and re-entered the business world with Stark Enterprises, Hammer sent the Adap-Tor (a robotic attack drone disguised as a helicopter) to attack the new company as a way of \\"welcoming\\" Stark back.Iron Man #217 For a time, Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the Death Squad in an attempt to kill both Tony Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed. When Force later attempted to go straight, Hammer sent Beetle, Blacklash, and Blizzard II to retrieve Force, but they were defeated by Force with help from Iron Man and Jim Rhodes.Iron Man #223‚Äì224 During the \\"Armor Wars\\" storyline, Hammer had Tony Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by Spymaster and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore powered armor (including Stilt-Man, the Raiders, the Mauler, Beetle, Crimson Dynamo and the Titanium Man).Iron Man #225 Iron Man set about to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable sanctioned technology in the armor of S.H.I.E.L.D.'S Mandroids and the Vault's Guardsmen, leading him into conflict with The Captain and his fellow Avengers. Hammer later sent the Rhino (who Hammer once provided a removable version of his armor to) to break Blizzard out of prison.Iron Man #238 He sent his \\"B-Team\\" (Blacklash, Blizzard, and Boomerang) to battle Ghost and Iron Man.Iron Man #239‚Äì240 Hammer redesigned Scorpion's tail and sent him to abduct General Musgrave. When Scorpion refused to complete his mission, Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino to retrieve the tail.Amazing Spider-Man #318‚Äì319 Hammer later learned that Tony Stark had been shot, and ordered a batch of orchids to be sent to him with a card expressing condolences should he live.Iron Man #243 He sent Boomerang to raid a Stark Enterprises security officeAvengers Spotlight #27 and hired Taskmaster to train the second Spymaster.Iron Man #254 Later, Hammer agreed to design a new costume for Rhino.Deadly Foes of Spider-Man #4 He sent Rhino and Boomerang to battle Cardiac.Amazing Spider-Man #344‚Äì345 With the Life Foundation, Roxxon Oil, Stane International, and the Brand Corporation, he abducted a number of superhuman beings to analyze their abilities. He also helped the first Sphinx to reclaim the Ka-Stone.Amazing Spider-Man Annual #26; Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #12; Web of Spider-Man Annual #8; New Warriors Annual #2 Years later, it was revealed that Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman Obadiah Stane, causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company. With operatives of HYDRA, Roxxon Oil, Moroboshi International, and the Trinational Commission, he tricked the Masters of Silence into attacking Stark Enterprises. Even when forced to sell his stock in Stane International to Stark for the sum of one dollar,Iron Man #281‚Äì283 Hammer had the last laugh when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later. Hammer later sent Barrier, Blacklash, and Ringer to recruit Luis Barrett to become the new Thunderbolt. The three villains were foiled by the Pantheon.Incredible Hulk Annual #17 Discovering that he had been diagnosed with an incurable cancer-like illness, Hammer resolved to destroy Tony Stark before he died. He infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering nanites that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation with Iron Man on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice when the water he fell into leaked out into space and instantly froze and is currently lost in space. While observing his frozen body drifting in Earth's orbit, Iron Man reflected that his foe would now \\"live forever\\".Iron Man: Bad Blood #1-4 Justin is later revealed to be the father of Justine Hammer and the grandfather of Sasha Hammer.

They also often contain the apparatus for traffic monitoring systems and cameras, or open road tolling systems. Gantries are usually built on high-traffic roads or routes with several lanes, where signs posted on the side of the highway would be hard for drivers to see. Gantries may be cantilevered or one sided on the left, right and center (sometimes referred to as a half-gantry or Butterfly gantry), or they may be bridges with poles on each side. Similar gantries are used in railway signalling or to suspend overhead lines on multi-track lines. Around the world =Canada= Gantry signs are commonly used in urban highways in Canada to support overhead signs. Half-gantries are used to place signs near exits where space does not permit having signs to the right side of the roadway. Gantries can also be used to hold cameras for toll road entrances/exits and to hold electronic information signs such as on Ontario Highway 407. The style of gantry used are mostly truss gantries. Older gantries have truss supports (round or box) and newer ones are now supported by cylindrical legs. In most jurisdictions in Canada, signs that are mounted on overhead gantries are installed perpendicular to the roadway. In Qu√©bec, however, signs are angled slightly face-down towards the roadway such that the sign face is directed towards the motorists below. In New Brunswick, the opposite is true: signs are angled slightly face-up to capture and reflect more sunlight towards the roadway. =Hong Kong= Hong Kong's highways use a Gantry crane type to support signs. The road signs are usually located on top and some have lights to indicate open or closed lanes. =United Kingdom= Gantry signs are being installed at various locations around the trunk motorway network as increasing amounts of traffic mean that road signs at the side of the carriageway are frequently obscured by large goods vehicles. They may also consist of variable-message signs, and more recently Active Traffic Management, to close lanes due to accidents and for other reasons. They can also be used to specify temporary speed limits. Gantries in the United Kingdom display exit (junction) numbers, distances to junctions / exits (1 mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mile, 1/3 mile, 3/4 mile, 2/3 mile) and destinations reached, and if necessary what lane to use for them. =United States= A tubular piped gantry in California. Gantry signs are used frequently in the U.S., particularly in urban areas where freeways have an exit every mile to fit in with the grid system. These half-gantries usually have the exit number and the road or street that can be reached. Gantries can also span the whole road, such as at major junctions.
