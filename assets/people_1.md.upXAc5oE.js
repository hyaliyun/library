Born in Launceston and raised in Bracknell, Tasmania, Fryett played backyard cricket with her brother Brad, and would bowl to him a lot. As a junior cricketer, she played for her school, and also with the local under-16 boys’ team. She began her interstate cricket career by playing for several seasons in Tasmanian underage and Cricket Australia Cup teams. In 2008 and again in 2009, she was named Tasmania's top female cricketer. At the start of the 2009–10 season, Fryett made her debut for Tasmanian Roar at the age of 17 years, when the Roar joined the domestic WNCL competition. In December 2009, she became the Roar's first national representative, upon being named in the Shooting Stars national development squad as a replacement for Ellyse Perry, who had commitments to her W-league soccer team. In 2013, Fryett was omitted from the Shooting Stars squad, but at the end of the 2013–14 season, she secured a Shooting Stars contract after taking nine wickets in six of that season's WNCL matches at an average of 25.44. Fryett experienced another setback early in the 2014–15 season, when a knee injury caused her to miss a round of WNCL matches against Queensland Fire. However, the injury turned out to be not as serious as first thought. The following summer, Fryett was part of the Hurricanes squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015–16), during which she took two wickets. She remained in the squad for the WBBL02 season (2016–17). During the Australian winter of 2017, she played cricket in Ireland with the support of an Adam Gilchrist Scholarship, funded by the Lord's Taverners. She then rejoined the Roar and the Hurricanes for the 2016–17 season. Fryett also plays netball for the Arrows team in Tasmania's ANZ State League.

It is a subsidiary of PT Jababeka Tbk which was established in 2007. As a 130 megawatt (MW) power plant generated by steam and gas (PLTGU), it strengthens Bekasi – Karawang electricity system through Cibatu substation owned by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).http://www.beritasatu.com/megapolitan/123484-pltgu- bekasi-power-perkuat-sistem-kelistrikan-bekasikerawang.html This state-owned company can only meet the needs of about 60 percent. To meet the rest, private sector needs to get involved.http://www.jababeka.com/pt-bekasi-power- completes-testing-commissioning A reliable and sustainable electricity supply with an international standard is a must for an industrial estate. Bekasi Power plant is therefore constructed to guarantee Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for a total of seven industrial zones including Jababeka. By delivering reliable electricity at a competitive price, this plant supports Jababeka business as well as surrounding areas, boosting Indonesia's power capacity and industrial growth for the upcoming years. Bekasi Power Plant Government and private by collaboration The cooperation between Bekasi Power and PLN is considered as a contribution to government's program. Through the scheme of cooperation all electricity will be purchased by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) at a price of Rp 1,050 per kilowatt hour (kWh). The scheme lasts for 20 years.http://thepresidentpostindonesia.com/2013/07/08/pt-bekasi-power- resmikan-pltgu-130-mw/ Later, the electricity will be redistributed to Jababeka Industrial Estate and its surroundings. PLTGU Bekasi Power, according to the Managing Director, is generated by gas supplied by state-owned companies i.e. PT Pertamina and PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN). Each day, the supplied gas needed is 23 million BTU (British Thermal Units). A BTU is a measure of the energy content in fuel, and is used in the power, steam generation, heating and air conditioning industries. Natural gas is usually measured in BTUs. Increasing the capacity Bekasi Power Control Panel Bekasi Power Turbine To anticipate the future demand, Jababeka as the holding company has anticipated that soon the capacity shall be increased. In order to build and double the capacity, a sufficient land has been prepared to accommodate the increased capacity from currently 130 MW to 2 x 130 MW. Future investors definitely need certainty to make sure their business works well. Therefore, industrial estate with complete infrastructure will surely interest them. And when the government has limited capacity and resources to provide, it is the turn of the private sector to engage. The cooperation between PLN and PLTGU Bekasi Power is a solution to overcome these obstacles. In term of manufacturing a power plant, private sector needs to see in broader scope. As the President Director's said: \\"We cannot solely rely on the sale of land, we need other income. One of them comes from the electricity sales to government.\\" He also emphasized that the electricity sales turnover to PLN has resulted Rp. 1 trillion because 100% output will be absorbed by PLN. Expanding to other areas Realizing the good prospect, the company is eager to grow the same business. It will continue to develop the same PLTGU project in several other areas. The areas that are now being observed are: the Special Economic Zone Tanjung Lesung, Kendal Industrial Estate, Cilegon and Morotai. They will also follow suit. If the area requires additional power supply then the construction of power plant will also be built to meet the energy needs. In term of future development, Bekasi Power has a plan to double the capacity from currently 130 MW to 2 x 130 MW in 2020. Ten years later, in 2030, they plan to increase to 3 x130 MW as a Green & Sustainable Energy Power Plant. At that time they will support electricity for all aspects in Bekasi, Cikarang, and Karawang i.e. housing, traffic system, industrial park, International Trade Center, commercial area, etc. High demand from industrial estates The demand for electricity for industrial estate is inevitable. This is reflected in the efforts of the Ministry of Industry which in the next five years plans to develop 15 new industrial areas which will be supported by electricity supply up to 11,064 MW. The government believes that to meet these needs, developers of each industrial estate must build their own power plants. They should not only rely on government power project plans but also to build their own factories.http://www.kemenperin.go.id/artikel/10972/15-Kawasan- Industri-Butuh-11.064-MW A total of 11,064 megawatts will be allocated to 13 industrial estates outside Java as the government's priority programs for industrial acceleration. Two other areas are located in Java, namely in Gresik, East Java and in Demak, Central Java. The demand for electricity for each industrial estate is clearly different. As in Batulicin, for example. In an industrial area of 530 hectares in South Kalimantan province, electricity needs 2,650 MW. Compare it to Sayung Industrial Estate in Demak, Central Java which requires only 42 MW. Differences in electricity demand occur not only because of the condition of the region but also the allocation. For industrial zones that focus on processing and refining minerals clearly require more electricity than labor-intensive industries. Selling price When a power plant is to be built in an industrial estate, it should also take into account the issue of price. According to the Chairman of the Indonesian Industrial State Association the imbalance between energy availability and the price offered is not a new issue. In general, entrepreneurs in industrial areas are currently getting prices stun above expectations. Electricity price of US$0.12 per kWh in Bantaeng Industrial Park, according to him, is still too expensive. The ideal price range for the industry is supposed to be US$0.08 –0.10 per kWh. Therefore, entrepreneurs must be careful in choosing the source of power to obtain the economic price. Import tax Building a power plant by a private company will always be fully supported by the government of the Republic of Indonesia. One of its supports is to apply tax deductions when importing components from abroad. \\"Components of power plants that have not been produced domestically and must be imported, can be tax deductible to only 10%.\\" References External links * Jababeka Category:Privately held companies of Indonesia Category:Electric power companies of Indonesia Category:Power stations in Indonesia ","title":"Bekasi Power"},{"id":"54035907","text":"Katlampudi is a village in West Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

A detonation of of TNT was used to study the resulting phenomena. The test was held at the Suffield Experimental Station in Alberta and was the largest ever man-made, non-accidental explosion in Canada. The test was also the first of its kind using a stacked TNT block hemisphere of such magnitude, a method repeated in six subsequent tests such as Operation Sailor Hat and Prairie Flat. The test allowed verifying predicted properties of shock and blast and determining its effect on a variety of military targets at varied distances from ground zero. Background Suffield Experimental Station is situated in an isolated part of the rolling prairie terrain of Alberta and at the time of the test was part of a 1000 square mile test range. This unique landscape offers clear views due to lack of trees and favorable weather conditions. Starting in the fall of 1963, teams from the involved countries began assembling at the test grounds for the joint operation, one of many in a series of non-nuclear blast tests under the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program. Initial preparations and construction work began in the winter of 1963 which was unusually mild and proved helpful. Virtually the entire station was mobilized for the effort and unusual equipment was designed and manufactured at the site's engineering and machine shops. The casting of the TNT was performed on site and began two years in advance of the test. Molten TNT was poured into special 12x12x4 inch rectangular molds and allowed to cool for 5 hours producing smooth caramel- colored rectangular blocks. A total of 30,678 were made with an average weight of 32.6 pounds each. Test Construction of the TNT hemisphere began six days before detonation. To protect from dust and sunlight and due to risk of lightning, the construction was not done in the open; instead, a building was constructed at ground zero that was to be wheeled away when the charge was complete. Each block was carefully fitted into a pre-calculated position to approximate a perfect hemisphere. When completed the stack measured 34 feet in diameter. Columns were drilled 80 feet into the ground at the blast site and then back filled with a colored soil mix to measure the expected horizontal and vertical displacement. Various military targets were also placed around the blast site. Local residents in Medicine Hat may have seen unusual cargo arriving on rail flatcars including heavy Jupiter and Nike configuration rockets. Other targets included a minefield, chambers and tunnels, reinforced concrete arches, fiberglass shelters, full scale troop models exposed and inside vehicles and gas masks. 60% of the targets were buried. Smoke mortars were installed to provide a white trail by which the shock wave could be tracked high above ground. An RCAF Neptune aircraft was also immediately above the test area for aerial photography. The detonation turned the TNT into a mass of highly pressurized gas and produced a large fireball and mushroom shaped cloud. The resulting crater was 240 feet across and within minutes partially filled with water. Unexpectedly, the crater also had a central updraft similar to moon craters which resulted in much speculation by the scientists. Many target objects were moved and damaged by the overpressure blast, especially the heavy rockets, and two M113 armored personnel carriers were flipped on their side. After the test, a full cross section of the crater was excavated to analyze the effects below ground.

From 1971 to 1985 he was the Director of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche's Centro di Studio per la Faunistica ed Ecologia Tropicali. In 1967 he created a new series of the journal Monitore Zoologica Italiano, which continued under his editorship until 1988. Leo Pardi's son and firstborn child Francesco Pardi became a docent at the Faculty of Architecture at the Università degli Studi di Firenze and in 2008 a Senator of the Republic of Italy. Scientific work Pardi was the first to scientifically describe dominance and rank order in wasps, based upon the species Polistes gallicus. He showed that, for fertile wasp females, shifting to a superior rank entailed further development of the ovaries, while shifting to an inferior rank entailed regression of the ovaries. He showed the trophic consequences of behavior and correctly hypothesized the involvement of the corpus allatum in dominance behavior. About ten years after the first studies on the behavior of wasps, Pardi began a new line of research, that of orientation in littoral animals. Here too, he began with a brilliant discovery: the demonstration of a time-compensated sun-compass mechanism of orientation in the sandhopper Talitrus saltator. ... The discovery of Talitrus orientation led to the extension of research work to a large number of animals belonging to different groups and living in a variety of ecotones. Pardi and his co-workers investigated several mechanisms of orientation in littoral animals and the innate and learned behavioral components of such orientation. Pardi also worked on insect histophysiology. He wrote a monograph on the fat body of insects and a paper on fertilized egg development in a tetraploid- parthenogentic strain of the moth Solenobia triquetrella. Honors and awards Pardi was the President of the Unione Zoologica Italiana from 1961 to 1963. He was elected in 1972 a corresponding member and in 1982 a national member of Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. Pardi received in 1976 the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize for the Biological Sciences and their applications and in 1989 the Balzan Prize for Ethology.

Cholodenko was a senior figure in the General Zionists liberal party and played a major role in the founding of Tel Aviv's Great Synagogue and Oneg Shabbat (joy of sabbath) cultural center—together with his friend, the prominent poet and intellectual Hayim Nahman Bialik. Biography Cholodenko, son of Yacov and Hinda, was born in the impoverished village of Sitenki in the district of Kiev of the Russian Empire (today's Ukraine). His mother died in childbirth, and as a newborn he was sent to the town of Ivankiv, where he was raised by his well-off uncle. A child of a traditional Jewish family influenced by the Haskalah movement, he studied the Hebrew Bible and excelled in Hebrew language and in both Jewish and European literature. His academic talents reached the ears of the local rabbi, Mordechai Levitzki, who became his private tutor. Ultimately trained as a teacher and pedagogue, Cholodenko initiated his Zionist activity immediately after the First Zionist Congress of 1897. He worked diligently for the establishment of a Zionist association in the district of Kiev, which soon numbered more than 150 members. The orthodox Hasids in the area, who fiercely resisted his Zionist activity, circulated defamatory rumors against him, but the great rabbi Mordechai Dov Twerski (whose father founded the Hornosteipol Hasidic dynasty), defended Cholodenko's work and was instrumental in its expansion. Avraham Cholodenko and his family, Kiev 1915 Cholodenko married Rivka, daughter of Yehuda Slutzki, a local Jewish leader (\\"Gvir\\"). With her he moved to Kiev, where he continued to advocate for Zionism, especially in the cultural realm. After the Second Zionist Congress (1898), he founded the first \\"improved cheder\\" (cheder metukan) in Kiev—a Jewish school which combined traditional subjects like Torah and Talmud with secular education taught in Hebrew. Following the great success of this initiative, his cheder began to offer adult evening classes, which facilitated Zionist activity in Kiev and contributed to the Aliyah movement to Palestine. Among his prominent students was Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi, a political leader of socialist Zionism and wife of the second president of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. A chronic throat disease forced Cholodenko to end his teaching career, and he dedicated the rest of his life to printing Hebrew texts. In 1917, at the outset of the Bolshevik Revolution, Cholodenko was elected a member of the first official Zionist committee in Kiev. He purchased a press house and changed its name to Tchiya (revival) as a symbol for the revival of the people of Israel. Cholodenko's press printed the Yiddish newspaper der Telegraph, but given growing Bolshevik censorship, his Zionist activities were forced underground. He started the clandestine synagogue \\"Knesset Israel\\" and a school which prepared youth for manual labor in Palestine. Great Synagogue Tel Aviv In 1920, Cholodenko was arrested with a few of his associates and upon his release immigrated to Palestine with his family. In Tel Aviv, he founded (with his friend, Avraham Gutman) a printing press not far from the Gymnasia Herzlia, which gave the press its name. He was active in the General Zionists and Keren Hayesod (the Foundation Fund), representing the liberal (or \\"bourgeois\\") constituency in the Yishuv in opposition to the socialist majority. He was also a member of the Great Synagogue committee and donated substantial sums of money for its construction. His close friendship with Hayim Nahman Bialik was instrumental in the founding of the Oneg Shabbat center, a hub of cultural initiative in Tel Aviv of the 1930s. Cholodenko was also a board member of the Association of Russian Jews, the Jerusalem Society, and the Tel Aviv Housing Charity, donating some of his fortune to the city's poor. As a staunch liberal, he firmly believed that private initiative was not at odds with the Zionist enterprise. Avraham Cholodenko died at Ohel Shem Hall in Tel Aviv in May 1942 in the middle of an assembly meeting of the General Zionists, which advocated for general education (instead of party controlled schools). He was buried in Nahalat YItzhak Cemetery. Personal life Avraham Cholodenko (sitting on the right) in Tel Aviv in 1928. Standing in the middle his son Aharon, and on the left—Eliyahu His eldest son, Dr. Yitzhak Cholodenko, distanced himself from his family's liberal Zionism and joined the Communist Party of the USSR. He served as a doctor in the Red Army and was killed in the Russian Civil War. His second son, Dr. Aharon Cholodenko, a graduate of Kiev University's medical school, was a Zionist activist during the British mandate in Palestine and a director of Kuppat Holim Amamait (later Mehuedet—the third largest health care organization in Israel). He married Yehudit Cholodenko (née Feinschreiber), a member of the Tel Aviv Education Committee and of the Association for Women's Equality. Their daughter Tamara married the journalist Nehamia Ben-Avraham, and their son, Amnon Helled, was one of Israel's first lawyers. Helled married Tamar, cousin of Zvi Dinstein, a Knesset member and junior minister for the Labor Party, and of Yoram Dinstein, the fifth president of Tel Aviv University. His daughter Nina (Pnina) Cholodenko married Shmuel Katz, a survivor of the Kiev pogroms (1919). Nina and Shmuel joined Ahdut Haavoda – Poale Zion (Labor Unity - Workers of Zion) and were among the founders of the urban Kibbutz Ef'al. His youngest son, Eliyahu Cholodenko, was sent to Berlin to study piano at the famed Stern Conservatory under Alexander von Fielitz, graduating first in his class in 1931. A communist and anti Zionist, he returned to Palestine but left it in the 1940s and settled in Paris, working as a professor of music at the Conservatoire de Paris. Amongst his descendants, we find planetary scientist Ravit Helled.

Di Stefano, Autilia Vitiello: IEEE 1855TM: The First IEEE Standard Sponsored by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society [Society Briefs]. IEEE Comp.Int. Mag. 11(4): 4-6 (2016) FML allows modelling a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The designers of fuzzy systems with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855-2016 uses the W3C XML Schema definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs. Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the results of their work in a form compatible with the Fuzzy Control Language (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of IEC 61131. FML lets people code fuzzy systems through a collection of correlated semantic tags that model the components of a classical fuzzy controller—such as knowledge base, rule base, fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. To design a well-formed XML-based language, an a XML schema describes an FML context-free grammar that defines name, type, and attributes that characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) changes this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules can convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an XSL file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers: * XML to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control * An XML schema to define the legal building blocks * eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific language IEEE 1855 was the first standard sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.

Design and development The CPA 1 had a two part, braced wing of constant thickness and chord which was straight-edged and swept at about 7°, built around two wooden spars and fabric covered. There was no dihedral. The trailing edges were filled with ailerons and inboard, camber- changing flaps. Its fuselage was rectangular in section, with a wooden frame which was wire cross-braced internally and ply-covered forward, with fabric covering aft. The wings were mounted over the fuselage on four vertical cabane struts and were braced with a pair of sloping parallel struts on each side between the wing spars and the engine-bearing frames. The latter were each attached to the fuselage with three more sets of struts, two to the lower fuselage and one to its upper longeron, as well as pairs of vertical struts to the wing undersides. The CAP 1 had two water-cooled Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V12 engines housed in long cowlings with front-mounted radiators; the fuel tanks were in the wings but oil reservoirs were placed in the engine housings. Aft of the CPA 1's semi-cylindrical nose there was a cabin about long for the observer. It had a forward facing window and a frame that could hold forty or ten bombs, deployed through ventral openings. It also had an open gun position in the nose and was equipped for vertical and oblique photography. The pilot's cockpit was under the wing trailing edge with a rear-gunner's position close behind, equipped with demountable dual controls, upward-firing machine guns on a flexible mount and a ventral hatch for another gun-mounting covering the lower rear field of fire. Its tailplane was unswept, with constant chord and angled tips, and was mounted on top of the fuselage, braced from below with pairs of struts. It carried narrow-chord elevators. The fin was broad and almost triangular and mounted a vertically edged, unbalanced rudder which reached down to the keel. The incidence of both fin and tailplane could be adjusted in flight to compensate for changes in centre of gravity or throttle setting. The CAP 1 had a conventional, fixed tailskid undercarriage, with independent pairs of mainwheels below the engines; each pair was mounted on two sets of V-struts, one vertical to the engine-bearing frame and the other to the lower fuselage longeron. The CPA 1 was first flown on 8 January 1926, beginning its development at Orly immediately afterwards. On 8 March the aircraft was flown by pilot Tache to Villacoublay to continue testing overseen by the S.T.Aé (Aircraft Technical Service), a government body responsible for certification. In November it was joined by a second example of the CPA 1. Their later history is unknown.

It was founded in 1933 by N.C.Madsen, manufacturing driver units for many high-end brands until 2014, when it made a transition into making its own wireless speakers. It launched a line-up of Bluetooth systems in 2014 and 2016 which are named after the capital cities of Scandinavian nations.  History  Vifa was founded in 1933 in Denmark by N.C. Madsen, a car mechanic in the small town of Videbæk in western Denmark. He founded his brand inspired by the name of his home town, \\"Videbæk Højttaler-fabrik\\" or Vifa, which could be translated as \\"Videbæk's loudspeaker factory\\". Madsen often visited his two brothers who worked at Bang & Olufsen, and all three brothers conducted experiments to develop loudspeakers for Bang & Olufsen, which until that point was supplied by a company in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1950, Vifa entered into a collaboration with the Norwegian distributor SEAS, to which it supplied chassis until 1980. Encouraged by this partnership, in 1980 Vifa launched its own identity and launched a complete range of loudspeakers, which made it one of the major players in the sector in Europe. After the acquisition of Scan-Speak in 1987, Vifa moved towards the production of high-quality products. In 1994, the company launched a membrane coupling technology with non-resonant suspension and a non-resonant pentagon- shaped membrane. In 1999, Vifa launched its star product, the Ring Radiator of the XT series, previously developed by Scan-Speak but rejected because it did not perform well. This 25mm coil tweeter was adopted by many manufacturers. Scan-Speak then resumed the development of this product to release a version under its own name, which was more sophisticated and more expensive. In 2000, Vifa and Peerless merged to form Danish Sound Technology with the manufacturing being moved to China under Tymphany hk. Tymphany abandoned 60% of Vifa loudspeakers and sold it under the name of Peerless V-Line, subsequently reassigning Vifa to work on its own speaker system and home theatre systems, essentially placing all transducers designed and manufactured by Tymphany in their China factory under the over-arching Peerless brand, regardless of quality. In 2014, Vifa announced its first wireless speaker, Copenhagen, which uses textiles by the Danish textile manufacturer, Kvadrat, and supports Apple Airplay.  Operations  After creating a new identity for their brand in 2014, Vifa started producing their own exclusive Wireless bluetooth speakers with the first being Oslo, followed by the portable bluetooth speaker, Helsinki in 2016 and Hi-Fi bookshelf speaker, Copenhagen and Hi-Fi soundbar, Stockholm.

In a racing career which lasted from November 1990 until May 1992 she competed in four countries and won five of her eight races. After winning her only start as a juvenile in 1990, she showed relentless improvement in the first half of the following year, winning two handicap races before taking the Oaks d'Italia and the Irish Oaks. She failed to reproduce her best form in her three subsequent races and was retired from racing in 1992. She had some success as a broodmare. Background Possessive Dancer was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by Walter Swinburn Limited. During her racing career she was owned by Ahmed Al Maktoum and trained by Alex Scott in Newmarket, Suffolk. Her sire Shareef Dancer was the highest-rated horse in Europe in 1983, a year in which he won the Irish Derby. He sired few other top-class horses but was the damsire of Dubai Millennium. Her dam Possessive was an unraced daughter of the American-bred miler Posse. Possessive's dam Front Row won the 1968 Irish 1000 Guineas and was a half- sister to Black Satin who won the same race two years later. Racing career =1990: two-year-old season= Possessive Dancer made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 November 1990 and started at odds of 100/30 in a six-runner field. Ridden by Walter Swinburn she stayed on in the last quarter mile to take the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from No Comebacks. =1991: three-year-old season= On her first run of 1991 Possessive Dancer was an assigned a weight of 122 pounds in a handicap race for three-year-old fillies over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse on 24 April. Starting at odds of 8/1 she took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by lengths from Elfaslah and seventeen other opponents. Twelve days later she started 4/1 favourite for a handicap over nine furlongs at the same track, despite carrying top weight of 134 pounds and facing male opposition for the first time. She was sixth of the twenty runners on the final turn but went to the front a furlong out and came home two lengths clear of Joli's Great. The filly was then stepped up sharply in class when she was sent to Italy to contest the Group 1 Oaks d'Italia over 2400 metres at San Siro Racecourse in Milan on 18 May. Ridden by Swinburn she started at odds of 4/1 in a twelve-runner field which included Brockette (winner of the Premio Dormello) and Marta Abba (Premio Baggio). Possessive Dancer maintained her unbeaten record as she took the lead a furlong out and won by two lengths from Imco Lisi with a further two and a half lengths back to Brockette in third. Steve Cauthen took over from Swinburn when Possessive Dancer was one of ten fillies to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 13 July. The Epsom Oaks winner Jet Ski Lady started favourite ahead of Third Watch (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Polemic (second in the Prix Saint-Alary) with Possessive Dancer next in the betting on 8/1. After settling his filly in fifth place Cauthen moved up into third behind Jet Ski Lady and the outsider Eileen Jenny entering the straight. Possessive Dancer produced a sustained run on the outside to wear down the Epsom Oaks winner and won by half a length, with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Eileen Jenny in third place. After five consecutive victories Possessive Dancer started 13/8 favourite in a seven-runner field for the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse on 21 August but sustained her first defeat as she came home fifth behind Magnificent Star, Jet Ski Lady, Shamshir and Third Watch. On her final run of the season she was sent to France for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 15 September and finished tenth of the fourteen runners behind Magic Night. =1992: four-year-old season= Possessive Dancer remained in training but made only one appearance when she finished last of the nine runners behind Sapience in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 1 May. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Possessive Dancer became a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced seven foals and four winners between 1994 and 2002: *Maylane, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 1994, sired by Mtoto. Won six races including September Stakes and Serlby Stakes. *Zeeneh, bay filly, 1995, by Machiavellian. Failed to win in three races. *Mayl, bay filly, 1996, by Lion Cavern. Unraced. *Mile Wa Quarter, bay colt (gelded), 1997, by Polish Precedent *Morshid, bay colt (gelded), 1998, by Gulch. Won one race. *Assraar, bay filly, 2000, by Cadeaux Genereux.

The library is located in Quitman, Georgia. The library is a member of PINES, a program of the Georgia Public Library Service that covers 53 library systems in 143 counties of Georgia. Any resident in a PINES supported library system has access to the system's collection of 10.6 million books. The library is also serviced by GALILEO, a program of the University System of Georgia which stands for \\"GeorgiA LIbrary LEarning Online\\". This program offers residents in supported libraries access to over 100 databases indexing thousands of periodicals and scholarly journals. It also boasts over 10,000 journal titles in full text. History =Origins= A library in Quitman was first advocated for in 1873 by the Literacy and Debating Club, a group of young men in the town. Accordingly, dues of $5.00 per year were collected in order to raise money to establish a permanent library and collection. In 1877 the Quitman Library Association was born, and canvassed the town for book donations to use for their upcoming library. With growing interest and increased publicity of the future library, and editorial in the Free-Press wrote of the necessity of more organization to let the library up and running, and the previously made Library Association was not doing its best to secure a public library space. The Editor of the paper charged the women of Quitman with putting together the library promising a sum of $500 towards its completion should they begin preparations right away. On January 31, 1880 the women of Quitman formed The Brooks County Public Library Association and the Quitman Library was established. As the library was founded in 1880 it is one of the oldest public libraries in the State of Georgia. Indeed, the Georgia Public Library Service, which was formed to aid the growth of the newly made library across Georgia at the turn of the century, was not created for another 17 years. For its beginnings, the library existed in a free room by one of the citizens of Quitman, Mr. L. F. Haddock. Dues were ten cents per month for women and children and twenty-five cents for men. Fundraising was very successful in the summer months to raise money to buy more books for the library. In September 1880 plans were made to create a two-story dedicated library building. Another fundraiser provided enough money to construct the building by 1881, bringing in over $1,000. =Search for a new library= One of the former Brooks County libraries, now a museum. Dues to the library were substantial enough during its early years to meet the costs of upkeep and maintenance, but with a growing population of Quitman and a higher interest in the public library, lack of money started to become an issue. A local bill was passed to allow Brooks County to allocate $600.00 per year for library use which solved this issue. In 1911 the library had again outgrown its building. Surrounding counties at this time were being met with great success by petitioning industrialist Andrew Carnegie for funds to construct their own public libraries. Brooks County similarly requested $10,000 from Carnegie in 1911 and secured a grant from the Carnegie Library Fund. However, despite this Carnegie grant, the lowest bids for construction were $12,000, and the Library Board denied this increased price believing the Carnegie Fund was more than enough to construct their building. After no plans to secure the bid were found, the Carnegie Fund cancelled the gift in 1919. Still in need of a new library, the citizens now resorted to old methods of fundraising. To help, in 1917 the city of Quitman agreed to provide another $50 per month for library purposes. Additionally, in 1925, Brooks County became the state's first county to pass a local bill authorizing the use of general county funds to support libraries. Funding also began to come in from various local clubs. The Quitman Woman's club provided $2,000, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy and Daughters of the America Revolution promised another $300 yearly. With the advent of the Works Progress Administration the county secured another $5,000 library grant. With adequate funding the new building began construction in 1933 and in 1939 was recognized in a pamphlet by the American Library Association as one of the ideal \\"Small Library Buildings\\" in the county - the only one chosen in the entire Southeast. The library continued to grow and receive proper funding over the next decade. In 1946 the library received $800 in state-aid to increase their outreach to rural communities. To do so, a bookmobile was added to the library in 1948. =Modern Years= In 1993 the library moved to its new location on Barwick Road and the grand opening was held in 1994.

In 1981, the production was transferred to PPZ Ameprod. In 1980, the system was released by PPZ Ameprod. In the first three years, about 10,000 consoles were sold. In 1984, the production ended and about 100,000 Ameprod TVG-10 consoles were sold. The TVG-10 featured six integrated games, of which without the separately available lightgun called Videotraf only four games were playable.  History  After the emergence of the AY-3-8500 chipset in the Nichtsozialistisches Wirtschaftsgebiet (NSW) in 1976, there were also considerations in Poland to produce such a consumer good. First attempts made the company Unimor in the 1970s. Two prototypes were produced, the Unimor GTV-881 tele-set and the GEM-1 from Elzab. Of these, only one was ready for the market and was produced in very small numbers (less than 1,000). Some electronic journals also published blueprints for the reader to build his own Pong console. These were all based on logic modules. Later, in Poland, the AY-3-8500 from General Instrument was finally legally acquired by the Federal Republic of Germany to build the TVG-10. Elwro began production of the TVG-10 in 1979, the console was available in 1980 in the radio and television departments in Poland. In the console, thanks to the AY-3-8500 chip, six fixed built-in games (Pong, Soccer, Squash, Practice and 2 shooting games) are preinstalled. The device was very expensive for the private customer and only about 10,000 units were sold in the first 3 years. In 1981, PPZ Ameprod took over the production. With this legal form, it was possible to obtain larger quantities of chips at better conditions, which allowed the increase in production numbers. The production of the system ended in 1984. In total, approximately 100,000 units of the TVG-10 were manufactured and sold.

The player character is a girl named Renée, who was a patient at the hospital in the 1940s. The game begins as Renee enters the now dilapidated asylum to relive her stay there. As the game progresses, it becomes known that Renee was admitted due to promiscuity, depression, and a volatile relationship with her mother. Renee found comfort in her doll, Charlotte. Renee walks the corridors of the derelict asylum, which triggers flashbacks of both her inpatient stay and circumstances prior. It is implied that Renee was a victim of sexual abuse within the asylum, perpetrated by a male nurse or doctor. Renee discovers Amara, another patient, and a romance ensues. When the nurses discovered this relationship, they were separated. Renee finds her old medical files, which imply that Amara did not exist and that they are figments of her imagination. After a thorough investigation in the patient property section, Renee finds Amara's possessions, thus proving her existence and that the medical team falsified some aspects of her mental illness. A note found by Renee reads that Amara died in 1942. Medical notes found whilst searching the facility imply that Renee was verbally and physically aggressive and often spent time tied to her bed. Renee receives electroconvulsive therapy and multiple sedative injections to ease behavioural symptoms. Renee discovers that correspondence from her mother does not reach her, and this is also discovered in the patient property section. After several years of communication censoring by hospital staff, Renee discovers that her mother died and tried to take her own life on multiple occasions. Following this, the game's conclusion shows Renee receiving lobotomy surgery. The story ends with a doctor narrating that the long term recovery for Renee post surgery is unclear. Reception On Metacritic, the game has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". A three-part series for PC Gamer explains how Lorenzo Conticelli designed the asylum setting for the game.

A visualization of the Koutecký–Levich equation. The graph shows the measured current as a function of the mass transport current for given kinetic current. The Koutecký–Levich equation can be written as: {1\\\\over i_m}={1\\\\over i_K}+{1\\\\over i_{MT}} where * im is the measured current (A). * iK is the kinetic current (A) from the electrochemical reactions. * iMT is the mass transport current (A). Note the similarity of this equation to the conductance of an electrical circuits in series. The Koutecký–Levich equation is also commonly expressed as: i_m={i_K i_{MT}\\\\over i_K+i_{MT}} The kinetic current (iK) can be modeled by the Butler-Volmer Equation and is characterized by being potential dependent. On the other hand, the mass transport current (iMT) depends on the particular electrochemical setup and amount of stirring.  Koutecký–Levich plot  In the case a rotating disk electrode setup is used and the electrode is flat and smooth, the iMT can modeled using the Levich equation. Inserted in the Koutecký–Levich equation, we get: Koutecký-Levich Plot. The inverse measured current is plotted versus the inverse square root of rotation rate {1\\\\over i_m}={1\\\\over i_K}+{1\\\\over {B_L \\\\omega^{0.5}}} where: * BL is the Levich Constant. * ω is the angular rotation rate of the electrode (rad/s) From an experimental data set where the current is measured at different rotation rates, it is possible to extract the kinetic current from a so-called Koutecký–Levich plot. In a Koutecký–Levich plot the inverse measured current is plotted versus the inverse square root of the rotation rate. This will linearize the data set and the inverse of the kinetic current can be obtained by extrapolating the line to the ordinate.

It was built between 1813–15 to ease overcrowding at Newgate Prison and closed in 1870, when all of the prisoners were transferred to the newly built Holloway Prison. Situated on Whitecross Street in Islington the prison was capable of holding up to 500 prisoners, although in normal circumstances less than half that number would be held there. The prisoners were held in six separate 'wards,' and included a 'Female ward.' Known both as 'Burdon's Hotel' (after one of Governors) and the 'Cripplegate Coffeehouse,' the prison seems to have had a worse reputation than the other London Debtors' prison of the time due to the fact that it had common wards rather than individual rooms: \\"[the] prison inspectors thought that 'the crying evil of Whitecross-Street Prison is that the well-disposed debtor when so inclined, had no means of protecting himself from association with the depraved.'\\" This was one of the prisons visited by Lydia Irving as part of Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies Society for promoting the reformation of female prisoners in the 1820s.Amanda Phillips, ‘Irving, Lydia (1797–1893)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 June 2017 A £20 payment known as 'Nell Gwynne's bounty' was given to inmates of Whitecross Street Prison each Christmas, a payment that could apparently be traced back to the long time mistress of King Charles II.

Gordon also invented the foam landing pits for pole- vaulters and high jumpers used in all Track and Field competitions including the 1968 Olympics, where they made their first Olympic debut. He created the first constant flow \\"Moon Bounce\\" air units and developed closed air recreation products for water and land. He has worked as a consultant for trampoline inventor George Nissen to design next generation landing pits for his company. Gordon has over 300 products on the market and holds approximately 40 patents. Early life and education Born in Los Angeles, California to Henry Fairfax Gordon and Anne Marie Gordon, Gordon grew up during the Great Depression and World War II. Gordon was a champion gymnast in high school at Garfield high in Los Angeles, CA where he graduated from in June 1951. That same month he joined the Air Force to serve for four years during the Korean War where he served as a survival instruction and rescue medic stationed in Saudi Arabia. After service in the military, he attended Brigham Young University where he majored in Biology and Physical Fitness, championship gymnast, taught gymnastics and earned a certificate as a driving instructor. He transferred to California State University, Northridge where he earned his master's degree in education to become a teacher and graduated in 1958. In the late 1960s Gordon co-authored four books with Dr. Bryant J. Cratty, head of the Special Needs Department at USC, that focused on the early childhood development of kids with special needs. Inventions =Port-A- Pit= While working with his discus and shot put replacements, Gordon would watch high jumpers and pole vaulters landing in sawdust and thought there must be a better way. Noticing some scrap foam, he decided to create a container for the foam and structure it into a landing pit. It was this innovation that led to the development of the Fosbury Flop style of High Jump by Dick Fosbury and allowed for dramatic improvements in height for both Pole Vaulting and High Jumping. Gordon was able to place the first foam pits in the 1968 Summer Olympics, and they have been in every Olympic Games since. =Skill Development Equipment= Thank you letter from Eunice Kennedy Shriver for help with the Special Olympics In 1969, Gordon wanted to create products to teach unskilled gymnasts in a safer manner. By removing fear associated with injury, the gymnasts were able to develop more quickly. These items were created with shaped foam with a vinyl cover and included items such as the incline mat, the connectable vault cylinders, jousting units and floor mats, to name a few. Gordon called El Monte High School where he used to teach and asked if he could try them out with some of the gymnasts at the school. The school suggested he also try them with some of their special needs students and the results were phenomenal. With special needs children, the process is focused on success, the more success they have, the better the children advance. With Gordon's inventions, kids with braces on their legs and other serious issues, were able to do front rolls, back rolls, climb, fall and have fun safely. More importantly, they succeeded. The school said the improvement in their attitude and success was incredible. Over 160 products were designed that are in use throughout the world today. Special Olympics with Rafer Johnson and Don Gordon Because of the success with the SDE line, Gordon reached out to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the Special Olympics and ended up coordinating the 1970 Special OlympicsSpecial Olympics in Southern California in Southern California and working with Olympic Decathlete Rafer Johnson at the games. =Living Designs= In 1967 Gordon became interested with injection mold plastics. As an accomplished sculptor, he started to build different functional animal shapes to be used as chairs, stools, toyboxes, flotation devices or anything a child could dream up. The company continued until 1974 when plastic prices exploded due to rising oil prices. =Nissen/Gordon= In 1975 George Nissen, who invented the trampoline in the 1930s, contacted Gordon to consult with his company on the development of next generation landing pits and other products. This joint venture was called Nissen/Gordon and lasted through the end of 1977 when George sold his company and the new owners were not interested in trampolines and landing pits. Gordon had already been working on his own version of Nissen's trampoline game Spaceball and convinced Nissen to sell him the rights for $1.00 to continue developing the game, which eventually became Hi-Ball and later Aeroball. =Hi-Ball= 1978 saw the development of the first Hi-Ball unit. A company in Tallahassee Florida had developed the first Round Trampoline, which Gordon thought would be perfect for his idea. He flew to their facility with his 15-year-old son where they worked on building the housing and frames to create the first ever Hi-Ball. The design was a radical departure from the Spaceball game he had licensed from Nissen, the primary difference was safety. Despite the great safety record, excessive litigation from every bump and scrape led to the discontinuing of the single trampoline design and the emergence of Aeroball with individual trampolines a few years later. In 1982, Hi-Ball was part of the Battle of the Network Stars.Hi-Ball at the Battle of the Network Stars Some notable installations were at Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. =Aeroball= 1983 introduced the next evolution of Hi-Ball as Aeroball. The primary difference was that each player now had their own trampoline and there was a pitchback net around the top. This was originally intended to compensate for the lack of one strategy move from the single trampoline design, namely \\"stealing\\" a bounce. The pitchback net was eventually discontinued as it was a significant amount of work to build and install and saw little use. =PlayMaze= In 1989 Gordon had 2 young sons, which inspired him to use the base Junior Hi-Ball concept and create multiple layers and access paths into a product he called PlayMaze. In 1990 he licensed PlayMaze to Keiser for 10 years, where they had tremendous success selling these play units to places like Burger King, McDonald's, 24 Hour Fitness, auto dealerships and even jewelry store chains for their play centers for children. As of 2016 there are still many of these units still deployed throughout the United States. =Airplay= In the late 1960s, Gordon inadvertently invented the constant air flow inflatable with \\"Moonbounce\\" which began the whole bounce house revolution and also led to the larger scale inflatables used to jump off of buildings. This was done with premier Hollywood stuntman Dar Robinson with whom Gordon became lifelong friends until Dars untimely death in 1986. Over time Gordon was frustrated with the limitations of this methodology, as they required constant electricity for blowers and units were difficult to move. The next evolution for him, was to make smaller units with closed cell systems that did not require constant electricity, that could be blown up like a life raft. These units were easier to move, setup and take down. This allowed for more variety and shapes. A regular truck or van can easily hold up to ten different units, providing a large variety of activities. You can even use a simple car battery to power the blower to inflate them. =Gordon's Action Products= In 2005 Gordon decided to consolidate his various products and companies under a single roof as Gordon's Action Products. The product lines generally fall under the Aeroball family of products and the Airplay family or products. A subset of Airplay is focused on Special Needs children specifically. Gordon's products are in use and available around the world to this day. Death On April 11, 2016, at 12:30 A.M. Gordon died after an eight-year battle with cancer.

It is native to Europe but has been accidentally introduced into North America where it became invasive. The larvae feed inside the developing fruits of the apple tree. Description The adult apple sawfly is up to long with a brownish-black head and thorax and a brown abdomen. The larva is a caterpillar-like grub with a brown head and white body, growing to about when fully developed. It can be distinguished from the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) larva by being creamy-white, with seven pairs of abdominal legs, while the latter is pinkish-white and has five pairs. The sawfly larva is active in the fruits two or three weeks earlier in the season than the codling larva. Distribution Native to Europe, this sawfly is widespread between 60° and 40° north latitude. Populations are also known in the western areas of the former USSR and in northern Turkey. It was first detected in North America on Long Island, New York, in 1939, and has since spread across the northeastern United States, and into Canada, reaching Quebec by 1979 and Ontario by 1987. A population has been present on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, since being detected in 1940. Life cycle Adult insects emerge in late spring at the time apple trees are in flower, and are attracted towards the open flowers on warm sunny days. Eggs are laid in slits cut just below the calyx, usually one egg per bloom. The eggs hatch about five days later, when 80% of the petals have fallen, and the newly hatched larvae make their way into the immature fruitlets, first burrowing under the skin and later tunnelling into the centre. As they grow larger, they tunnel outwards and move into an adjoining fruitlet, making a large entry hole which gets clogged with brown, sticky frass. When their development is complete and they have tunneled into several fruitlets, the damaged apples fall to the ground. The larvae make papery cocoons underground in which to overwinter. Pupation takes place in this cocoon in the spring but some individuals spend two winters underground. Controlled experiments in the late 1970s showed 17% – 26% of adults emerged a year after 250 larvae cocooned, while 1% – 9% emerged in the second year. Two solitary adults were recorded emerging the third year after cocooning. The pupae are susceptible to desiccation and a number of fungi, such as Paecilomyces fumosoroseus. Damage When a newly hatched larva burrows under the skin of the fruit it leaves a characteristic ribbon scar; if the larva dies before it tunnels to the core, the fruit can continue to grow and later be harvested. More seriously damaged fruitlets fall from the tree. Certain varieties of dessert apple such as Discovery and Worcester Pearmain are particularly susceptible. Pears are unaffected. Sticky traps can be used to catch adult sawflies to monitor the levels of attack and assess whether pesticides would be economical to apply. Control In Europe, the apple sawfly has a number of predators and parasites which help to keep it under control. One of these is the parasitoid wasp Lathrolestes ensator which is a parasite of the larvae. In North America, these natural enemies are not present and the pest causes more significant damage to apple crops. In an attempt to alleviate this situation, L. ensator has been imported from Europe to help act as a control. Biological pest control has been investigated using the entomogenous nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. These were effective in the laboratory when used as a foliar spray, and in a field trial as a ground drench against the larvae. These treatments may also control plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar) as part of an integrated pest management programme. Research has shown that quassin and neoquassin, extracted from Quassia amara, can provide control of H. testudinea in organic agriculture; commercial formulations are used in Germany and Switzerland, but are expensive. Several species of ascomycote entomopathogenic fungi have also been used as control agents. Metarhizium anisopliae (sensulato), Beauveria bassiana (sensulato), Isaria farinosa, Isaria fumosorosea, Aspergillus flavus and Lecanicillium lecanii have all been shown to result in high mortality rates of larvae at the time the apples fall to the soil. In Swedish and Danish orchards, Metarhizium brunneum is one of the most common entomopathogenic fungi species.

The organization was affiliated with the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, and worked with the NAACP.  About  Alice Wiley Seay founded the Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs (ESFWC) in Brooklyn in August 1908. The first convention took place at the Bethel A.M.E. Church in New York City in July 1909. The organization has created educational endowments. In 1933, they formed the Empire State Association of Youth Clubs for black girls. The organization also saw that Harriet Tubman, who was living in poverty in the Tubman Home, would need continuing donations to support her care in her old age. The ESFWC was sending Tubman $25 a month for expenses, which supplemented the $20 a month she received as a pension. Tubman's expenses came to around $40 a month. The club has continued to honor Tubman's memory in various ways. In 1915, the group created a monument designed by Mrs. Jackson Stewart at Tubman's grave. In 1974, the ESFWC paid tribute to Tubman at their annual convention, and over 300 women attending the convention visited the Tubman home.

The series was greenlit on May 11, 2017, and aired on ABC as a Tuesday night entry during the 2017–18 television season. The series premiered on October 3, 2017. The show was set in Taylor, Texas. On May 11, 2018, Kevin (Probably) Saves the World was cancelled after one season by ABC. Premise Kevin, a down-on-his-luck man who survived a suicide attempt, moves in with his twin sister Amy, an engineer and professor at the local college, and Amy's teenage daughter Reese. Shortly after, he encounters a celestial being named Yvette; Yvette claims that God has tasked Kevin with saving the world, and sent Yvette to guide and protect him. At first, Kevin was the only one who could see and hear Yvette, so his conversations appear to be hallucinations to those around him. Kevin must perform good deeds to build up his spiritual powers, forcing him to become a better person. The series also explores a mystery, as there are supposed to be 36 righteous souls in each generation, but for unknown reasons, Kevin is the only one known to be left. The series ended with Kevin having located three other righteous souls, and in a surprise revelation, allowed Yvette to appear in front of Amy, as she was now called upon to help Kevin in their quest.

It connects more than 250 million devices directly to 3,500+ local public safety agencies. Founded in 2012 by Michael Martin and Nicholas Horelik, RapidSOS seeks to improve caller data accuracy in 9-1-1 centers, pairing with Internet of Things companies to develop and publish various products for public safety officials and centers. RapidSOS’ first product was the Haven mobile application. Since then, the company has focused on integrating directly with 9-1-1 software and connected device companies to send life-saving emergency information to 9-1-1 telecommunicators without a user needing to use an app. The company has introduced product offerings such as RapidSOS Clearinghouse, RapidSOS Portal, and RapidSOS Emergency API Suite. RapidSOS has working relations with companies like Apple, Uber, Google, and MedicAlert to facilitate emergency response. History RapidSOS was founded in 2012 by Michael Martin and Nicholas Horelik. Martin had a personal experience with 9-1-1 connection difficulties when his father fell off of the roof of his home in Rockport, Indiana, breaking his wrist and shattering his hip. Martin's father could not reach 9-1-1 from his cellphone and was laying outside in freezing temperatures until his wife came home and called 9-1-1 from their landline. Martin also cites an experience he had after first moving to New York City, when he was followed closely by a man who had intentions to rob him. In wanting to call 9-1-1, he states, he \\"realized just how difficult it is in the middle of whatever your emergency is to get out your phone, dial a number, and have a coherent conversation about who you are, where you’re located, and what’s occurring.\\" RapidSOS’ first product was the smartphone app Haven. The app gave users the ability to see family members' real-time locations, \\"check in\\" to send their location to their loved ones, and call 9-1-1 on behalf of a loved one, sending that person's location and personal information to the dispatch center closest to them. In August 2020, RapidSOS entered a partnership with Sirius XM. The partnership allows connected vehicles to send information automatically to first responders. Featured products The company has transitioned to be B2B focused, launching products to connect public safety agencies and Internet of Things (IoT) companies. RapidSOS sends information from IoT devices and apps to public safety during emergencies. RapidSOS Portal enables agencies to access the information directly on their screens. =RapidSOS Clearinghouse= RapidSOS Clearinghouse allows public safety answering points (PSAPs) to \\"securely access device-based hybrid location information from smartphones\\" during calls to 9-1-1. When a RapidSOS- enabled device or app sends an emergency request, data is securely sent to the clearinghouse, which can then be accessed by 9-1-1 call takers through RapidSOS Portal. =RapidSOS Portal= RapidSOS Portal is a web-based tool for 9-1-1 centers which “allows any public safety agency to access life-saving additional data at no cost.” Call takers can query caller phone numbers into the service and view location and situational data about the caller and their surroundings, provided from the IoT partners through the Clearinghouse. =RapidSOS Emergency API Suite= The RapidSOS Emergency API Suite is a service which “integrates technology directly with emergency services.” The suite includes “Location API, Static Profile API, Data Pull API, Multimedia API, Call Flow API, Map Data API,” all of which allow Internet of Things and app companies to share specific situational data to 9-1-1 call centers during emergencies.

Stratovolcanoes and individual cones form the Pastillito volcanic group, which is formed mainly by andesite and dacite. Apart from the high Pastillito, the high Volcan de la Sal and the high Dona Ines volcano are part of the chain. Other features are lava domes and sector collapse deposits. Pastillito lies in a longitudinal valley that extends in north-south direction in the Andes. The Laguna San Francisco and the Salar de Maricunga are located in this valley. A sanctuary has been identified on its summit, a typical occurrence in regional volcanoes. The Pastillito group is of middle Miocene age. One date obtained on Pastillito is 12.9 ± 0.5 million years ago. Additional ages range from 15.9 ± 0.7 to 16.2 ± 0.7 million years ago. It is part of an older, more westerly phase of volcanic activity in the region of Ojos del Salado; the present-day activity occurs farther east. At the same time as Pastillitos, the volcanoes Cadillal, Jotabeche Norte, La Laguna, Ojos de Maricunga, Santa Rosa and Villalobos were formed. The volcano has been degraded by erosion, which has exposed the Marte gold porphyry deposit in a large amphitheatre.

Ele e Hackman desenvolveram a metodologia do Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS), também conhecida por Teoria Motivacional das Características do Trabalho. Fonte: . Acesso em: 8 jul. 2009. Teoria das Características das Funções A identificação de fatores de motivação no trabalho foi objeto de pesquisa de Hackman e Oldham. Eles criaram o chamado modelo das características da função. Entendemos aqui função como sendo uma atividade específica de cargo assumido em uma instituição ou o próprio cargo; uma profissão; um ofício. Hackman e Oldman (apud CUNHA, 2004) chegaram à conclusão de que são cinco as características do trabalho que contribuem para fazer da função uma fonte de motivação: Variedade: uma função será mais consistente numa repetição anto menos variada quanto rotineira de atividades; esta característica refere-se ao grau de exigência no que diz respeito ao uso de competências, atividades e conhecimentos diversificados. Identidade: o grau em que a função requer a execução de um trabalho identificável com principio e fim, e que origina um resultado visível. Um exemplo de uma função com elevado grau de identidade é o trabalho do artesão que produz uma peça na sua totalidade; e por tê-la produzido do principio ao fim é que lhe confere esse nível de identificação com ele próprio. Significado: diz respeito ao impacto do trabalho nas vidas dos outros, seja de dentro ou de fora de uma organização; quanto maior o impacto maior o significado do trabalho. Autonomia: o nível de independência no planejamento do trabalho e na respectiva forma de organização. Por exemplo, o nível de autonomia de um empregado do McDonald’s é limitado pela existência de um conjunto muito preciso e detalhado de procedimentos. Feedback: refere-se em quantidade e qualidade à informação sobre o progresso do individuo na execução da tarefa e os níveis de desempenho alcançados. Greg R.

He was the Director of the Republican Clinical Hospital of Moldova (RCH) for over forty years (1960–2003). As of 2017, the RCH is named after him.  Early life  Timofei Moșneaga was born on 6 March 1932 in Corjova, Dubăsari district to Vasile and Eufrosenia Moșneaga. He was one of eight children, having four sisters and three brothers. He attended the primary school in his home village, then – the secondary school in Dubăsari. In the period 1947–1950 he attended the School of Medical Assistants in Bender and, after graduation – the Faculty of General Medicine of Chișinău State Institute of Medicine (CSIM). In 1959, after he had obtained his medical diploma, Timofei Moșneaga was admitted to doctoral studies. Shortly after finishing his studies, he defended the MD thesis in medical sciences and afterwards was conferred the academic rank of Associate Professor.  Professional career  In 1960, at the age of 28, he was appointed Director of Republican Clinical Hospital (RCH). Timofei Moșneaga held this position for over four decades and brought an essential contribution to the development of the institution. The old hospital located in adapted buildings during the post-war period did not meet the standards in specialized assistance. Therefore, the new Director became interested in building a new hospital. Finally, after considerable efforts, the hospital was put into operation. Shortly, specialized departments for patients with somatic and surgical diseases endowed with up-to-date medical technologies, including equipment for the modern method of lithotripsy of kidney stones opened at the RCH. Departments of gastric surgery, proctology, vascular surgery, paediatric cardiac surgery and endoscopic surgery were established in the surgical building. The Department of Medical Diagnosis was equipped with up-to-date equipment, thus, establishing offices of magnetic resonance tomography, the Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Bacteriological Laboratory, the Department of Angiography of Peripheral Vessels and Cardioangiography. Timofei Moșneaga brought a great contribution to the creation of proper conditions for teaching, scientific and clinical activities carried out at 15 chairs of the CSIM. He has published circa 150 scientific papers, including 3 monographs, as well as educated 16 Doctors of Medicine.

For the design and construction of the new building of the Republican Clinical Hospital, Timofei Moșneaga was awarded the title of Laureate of the State Prize of the Moldavian SSR in literature, arts and architecture (1982). In 2002, in honour of the 185th anniversary of the Republican Clinical Hospital's foundation, as well as the 70th birthday of head physician Moșneaga, Moldovan publicist Ion Stici wrote a biography titled Timofei Moșneaga – The People's Doctor. For outstanding merits in his professional activity, Timofei Moșneaga was awarded the honorary titles of Doctor Emeritus of the Moldavian SSR, People's Doctor of the USSR and received high state distinctions, among which the Order of the Republic. In 2003 he was awarded the title of Honorary Director of the Republican Clinical Hospital.  Political career  He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1953. In 1957, he was elected Member of the Chișinău City Council. In 1989, Timofei Moșneaga was elected Member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and was member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Following Moldova's proclamation of independence, he was appointed leader of the group of special observers in the State Council of the USSR. In 1994, he was elected Member of the Moldovan Parliament, being part of the Committee for Social Protection, Healthcare and Ecology. In the period 1994–1997, Timofei Moșneaga held the office of Minister of Health of the Republic of Moldova.  Legacy  Timofei Moșneaga passed away on 1 June 2014 in Chișinău.

Personal life Keyser was born on 15 January 1749 in Bragernes in Drammen, Norway to the businessman Christen Nielsen and his wife Anna Rosine Keyser. His mother was from the Keyser family from Frankfurt am Main. When Johan was young, he became an orphan and was raised by his maternal grandmother, which is why Johan took his mother's maiden name as his last name. He was married twice. The first marriage was in 1781 to Karen Frederikke Vilhelmine Poppe. She died after 6 years of marriage. He then married Kirsten Margarethe Wangensteen in 1792. He was the father to professor Fredrik Wilhelm Keyser, historian Rudolf Keyser and theologian Christian Nicolai Keyser. He is also the uncle to the scientist Jens Jacob Keyser. Education and career Growing up, he was taught by the priest Peder Hesselberg, one first of the Herrnhutterne in Norway. He received his Cand.philol. degree in 1766 from the Frederiksborg School. After this, he held several different teaching positions. In 1777, he received the recommendation of the Bishop Christen Schmidt to become the resident chaplain in the parish of Ullensaker. After 14 years there, in 1791 he moved to Christiania to become the prison priest at the Christiania Tugthus (prison). In 1795, he got a new job as the parish priest in Aker, a position that included being the palace priest for the royal family. Ten years later, he was appointed to be the Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand. By this time, however he was getting old and in poor health, so he accomplished little. He died on 1 December 1810, after about five years as bishop. The Danish historian D. Thrap said of him: He was a gentle, meek, pervasive personality who won the hearts of people everywhere.

Producer Robert de Nesle's idea of for the film was to adapt Gérard de Villiers' popular S.A.S. novels, but he could not obtain the rights. This led to Freda making the fourth film in the Coplan series. The Coplan films were based on novels by Belgian writers Gaston Van den Panhuyse and Jean Libert. The lead in the film was Richard Stapley, who spoke positively about working with the director, describing him as \\"a very good director whom everyone thought should be working on much better things than this lowbudget spy film.\\" The film was filmed on location in Korem, Turkey and Paris between 24 June and 9 August 1965. Two endings for the film were shot, one with Coplan ending up with a girl played by De Nesle's girlfriend at the time. Stapley described her acting in the scene as \\"so inept that the scene couldn't be used.\\" Release The Exterminators was distributed theatrically by C.F.F.P. in France on 11 October 1965 with a 96-minute running time.

Premise  The series chronicles what happens when a couple's marriage is suddenly reignited by their divorce. The couple has three children who live in the house with one parent on alternating weeks while the other parent lives as a single person who stays in the garage apartment in the back of the house. The garage-dwelling \\"single\\" partner is free to date while having no responsibilities in the house or for the children. The \\"parent\\" partner is free to preside over the house and family as they deem best. Each week the parents learn a little more about what it is they are lacking in the parenting and \\"romantic\\" parts of their lives, and in doing so become better parents and better romantic partners. Often the insight they gain allows them to see why their spouse felt unhappy in the marriage; thus helping them to improve as a person. This increasingly improved person they become also becomes slightly more alluring to their ex-spouse making their complete separation seem less likely.

The river has a total length of 40 km. It takes its source in Maskinongé Lake, located in Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon. It crosses the municipalities of Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon, Saint-Gabriel, and Saint-Didace in the region of Lanaudière; then Saint-Justin, Louiseville, and Maskinongé before pour into the north shore of Lake Saint-Pierre at the height of this municipality. Toponymy The name of the river comes from the muskellunge (\\"Esox masquinongy\\"), a species of pike from North America. Its name comes from the Algonquin and means \\"deformed pike\\".  Geography  =Course= Falls of Sainte-Ursule The Maskinongé River begins its course at an altitude of 142 m in lake of the same name. It then flows south-east for a distance of 52 km and flows into the St. Lawrence River at Maskinongé altitude of 3 m. It has two major gradients: the Lauzon Falls where it drops from 30 m and the Saint-Ursula Falls where it drops from 70 m. =Geology= The upstream section of the Sainte-Ursule Falls is part of the Laurentides, a section of the Canadian Shield. The latter formed a billion years ago and was probably as high as the Himalayas. A slow erosion process has brought it back to its current level. The downstream section is part of the St. Lawrence Platform. =Population= The basin was inhabited by a unit of 14,000 people in 2006. The largest urban agglomeration in the basin is the town of Saint-Gabriel, which is located on the shore of the Lac Maskinongé.  Natural environment  We find 52 species of fish. The main sporting species are the Salvelinus fontinalis (Salvelinus fontinalis), Salvelinus namaycush (Salvelinus namaycush) (Salvelinus namaycush) and the muskellunge (fish) (Esox masquinongy). There are also the red knight (Moxostoma macrolepidotum), Ambloplites rupestris, brown trout (Salmo trutta), Semotilus corporalis, Perca flavescens, the horned mule, 'Semotilus atromaculatus', black sucker (Catostomus commersonii) and brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus). The basin is frequented by birds.  History  The Attikameks used the Maskinongé River as a route from Matawinie to Trois-Rivières. In 1700, French settlers began settling in Maskinongé. As for Lake Maskinongé, the first settlers settled there in 1818. The north of the basin was occupied from 1880 by the club Mastigouche, a private club of hunting and fishing. This was nationalized in the 1970s and integrated into the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve and the Nymphs' Nest.

Bilderback later brought Michael Knapp in to help produce. Also playing bass Knapp helped Bilderback establish the original line up of SixTwoSeven in 2016. After bringing in Drummer David Cook, Bilderback & Knapp brought in siblings Jason and Matt Bilderback before heading into the studio. In spring of 2016 SixTwoSeven recorded their first EP with DubSeven Records at A Soundhouse Studio in Seattle Washington with Legendary Sub Pop Producer Jack Endino. The release of the EP titled Some Others Day came in August that same year. After their first West Coast Tour with Texas band Drive On Mak they headlined Rock Shows from Portland to L.A., including a stop in Roswell New Mexico for the International Film Festival of 2017 (where the band was nominated for a ROSSI Award for Best Rock Band). Tour plans took the band back to L.A. in the summer of 2017 appearing at the world famous Whisky a Go Go with Agent Orange (band). DubSeven Records subsequently released a promotional video of this entire 30 minute performance. Plans were leaked from DubSeven Headquarters that a full length LP was to be released in winter of 2018. The LP titled \\"Already Gone / Dead on the Table was released in September (29th) after a string of singles and B sides through out the summer of 2018, which included an \\"on-board\\" music video for New Solutions where Bilderback is seen skateboarding. The record debuted at #497 on the College Radio Charts, and broke into the top 150 the first week of October at #141, reaching as high as #135. It was produced by illfunk, mastred by Endino, and released on DubSeven Records. History SixTwoSeven released their debut EP \\"Some Other's Day\\" courtesy of DubSeven Records, on August 5, 2016. SixTwoSeven is a five piece rock band composed of Greg \\"illfunk\\" Bilderback on guitar and vocals, Jason \\"J Danger\\" Bilderback on rhythm guitar, Mike \\"MK Ultra\\" Knapp on the bass, Dave \\"Dee Cee\\" Cook on Drums, and another Bilderback brother, Matt \\"the Machine\\" Bilderback on keys and vocals. The band formed in 2016 after \\"illfunk\\" had been pushing the Self Produced Demo \\"Allow me for a moment...if you will...to be Frank\\" on the web for several years. The demo, featuring 7 songs recorded and played entirely by Bilderback (Greg) himself, began gaining notoriety online, and prompted him to put together a live show line up, and by mid March 2016 videos began surfacing of the 3 piece performing live. By the end of March a decision was made to add J Danger to the line up for the recording and ensuing tour. A few short weeks later, while in the studio recording \\"Some Other's Day\\" with Nirvana Producer Jack Endino at Soundhouse Studios in Seattle (also known for his work with Mudhoney, and Soundgarden), another Bilderback was brought in. Initially thought just to provide support for backing vocal tracks on the CD, the band and Endino fell in love with Matt's harmonic contributions, and shortly there after a Nord Stage Keyboard Sponsorship was awarded to the Machine so that he could join the band on stage. The album was mastered by Grammy Award Nominee Joe Lambert (The Revenant). A West Coast Tour with Austin TX Punk-a-billy Drive On Mak, took place in the Summer of 2016, with stops in Seattle, Olympia, San Jose, Los Angeles and Portland. The band shared the stage with Drive on Mak, as well as Portland up and comers the Welkin Dim. In early 2017, the band parted ways with drummer David Cook, and Matt \\"The Machine\\" Bilderback moved from keys to full time drummer of the band. The band is currently a 5 piece with the addition of Nat Linville. Other projects involving members of SixTwoSeven over time have included, Wheelchair, Five Hoss Cartwrights, Test Proof Positive, the Phil Bilderback Trio, Alpine Frequency, Victor Cutoff, Drive on Mak, Jason and the ArgoScotts, illfunk and MC MD, illfunk and DJ Mindbender, and Bork Laser Musical Influences The band has been known to describe their sound with the line \\"The attitude of an Underdog, with the punch of a champion\\". Bilderback is a self proclaimed MUSE and Foo Fighters fanatic, and influences can be heard in his music from Dinosaur Jr, Queens of the Stone Age, Weezer, Radiohead, and Royal Blood. They have been described as blue collar rock and roll band, with a heavy guitar riff driven sound not unlike that of AC/DC of stadium rock lore. The band has also described their sound as \\"A precisely measured combination of elements: Equal parts Punk, Grunge, Alt and Stadium Rock, with a dash of smashed computer parts and broken glass.

In 1866, she secured a prize of for a prose essay, and in 1879, a prize of the same amount for the best poem, expressing the gratitude of the South to the North for aid in the yellow fever epidemic. Her \\"Brier Rose\\" won the prize for the best poem offered by The Augusta Chronicle in 1889, and her poem, \\"The Lion and Eagle\\", a welcome to the England peace deputation, attracted much attention. Her writings were limited in number, but were of excellent quality. Of Eve's poems, the best known are \\"Conquered at Last,\\" \\"Woes of Ireland,\\" Unfulfilled,\\" \\"Filling his Place,\\" \\"Easter Morning,\\" and \\"The Lion and the Eagle.\\" Early years and education Maria Louise Eve was born February 11, 1842, near Augusta, Georgia. She was the daughter of Dr. Edward Armstrong Eve, a physician, and Sarah Jane Raiford. Her ancestors were of old English ancestry. Her great- great-grandfather, Oswell Eve, commanded a man-of-war, The Roebuck, under George III, in ante-revolutionary days. Upon the opening of hostilities, he requested \\"to be sent on other service, as he had many friends in the Colonies\\". The family afterward came to America, locating first in Philadelphia, removing to Charleston, South Carolina, and finally to the neighborhood of Augusta, Georgia. From childhood she showed a love for both poetry and prose. Career Her first literary success was a prize for the best essay awarded by Scott's Monthly Magazine. Thereafter, she contributed, from time to time, articles on literary and other subjects to some of the prominent magazines and papers of her day. In 1879, her poem \\"Conquered at Last\\" won the prize offered by the Mobile, Alabama News for the best poem expressing the gratitude of the South to the North for aid in the yellow fever scourge of the preceding year. That poem was reproduced in nearly all of the papers and many of the magazines of the North, and also in some periodicals abroad. Its great popularity throughout the North, attested by the large number of letters received by her from soldiers and civilians was a complete surprise as well as a great gratification to her. In June 1889, a short poem by her, entitled \\"A Briar Rose\\", won the prize offered by The Augusta Chronicle. At the request of the secretary of the American Peace and Arbitration Society, in Boston, as a message of welcome to the English Peace Deputation to America in October 1887, she wrote a poem, \\"The Lion and the Eagle\\". The underlying thought of the \\"Universal Peace,\\" as found in one of her published poems, led the secretary to communicate with her in regard to it, and she subsequently wrote a number of poems bearing on the subject. Conquered at Last Shortly after a yellow-fever scourge swept up the Mississippi Valley the \\"Mobile News\\" offered a prize for the poem by a Southern writer which best expressed the gratitude of the Southern heart towards the people of the North for the philanthropy and magnanimity so nobly and freely displayed during the pestilence. This offer called forth 77 compositions from various parts of the South, and the prize was finally awarded to Eve, the author of \\"Conquered at Last\\". :You came to us once, O brothers, in wrath, :And rude desolation followed your path. :You conquered us then, but only in part, :For a stubborn thing is the human heart. :So the mad wind blows in his might and main, :And the forests bend to his breath like grain :Their heads in the dust and their branches broke; :But how shall he soften their hearts of oak? :You swept o'er our land like the whirlwind's wing; :But the human heart is a stubborn thing. :We laid down our arms, we yielded our will; :But our heart of heart was unconquered still. :\\"We are vanquished,\\" we said, \\"but our wounds :must heal;\\" We gave you our swords, but our hearts were steel. :\\"We are conquered,\\" we said, but our hearts were sore, :And \\" Woe to the conquered \\" on every door. :But the Spoiler came and he would not spare. :The angel that walketh in darkness was there;— :He walked through the valley, walked through the street, :And he left the print of his fiery feet :In the dead, dead, dead, that were everywhere, :And buried away with never a prayer. :From the desolate land, from its very heart, :There went forth a cry'to the uttermost part:— :You heard it, O brothers!—with never a measure :You opened your hearts and poured out your treasure. :O Sisters of Mercy, you gave above these! :For you helped, we know, on your bended knees. :Your pity was human, but O! it was more, :For you shared our cross and our burden bore. :Your lives in your hands you stood by our side; :Your lives for our lives—you laid down and died. :And no greater love hath a man to give, :Than to lay down his life that his friends may live. :You poured in our wounds the oil and the wine :That you brought to us from a Hand Divine. :You conquered us once, our swords we gave; :We yield now our hearts—they are all we have. :Our last trench was there, and it held out long: :It is yours, O friends! and you'll find it strong. :Your love had a magic diviner than art, :And \\"Conquered by Kindness\\" we'll write on our heart.

He was the last surviving surgeon to have worked during the landings.  Early life  Brewer was born on 29 April 1913 to Oscar John Brewer, inspector of education in the city of Liverpool and Marian Brewer née Almond. His early education was at Quarry Bank School.  Medical career  Brewer attended Liverpool medical school when only 15 years old. As a medical student, he won numerous prizes and medals in physiology, anatomy, medicine, pharmacology, obstetrics and gynaecology. In addition, he happened to be a skilled after-dinner speaker and represented his university in other cities. He graduated in 1935 with honours and subsequently did his first house jobs at Liverpool Royal Infirmary. His achievements in anatomy led him to do research in anatomy and to become an anatomy demonstrator. As well as being surgical tutor, he was appointed Robert Kelly's surgical registrar. Brewer was awarded his fellowship in surgery, FRCS, in 1938 at the age of 25 years and completed his training as a resident surgical officer at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. Being a Territorial Army officer with the 6th (1st Southern) Oxford Territorial Hospital at the onset of WWII, Brewer was mobilised with his unit and was unable to take up the Leverhulme fellowship which he had won. He witnessed action in Egypt, Palestine, Syria and France. Following the D-Day landings, he performed twenty operations a day for nine months, carrying out more than 1000 surgical procedures in total. On arrival in Normandy, he was allocated number 12 out of the 12 Field Surgical Units (FSU) on the front line. Accompanied by an anaesthetist, his team were self-contained with two lorries and an operating theatre. He performed surgery on General Sikorski, whilst posted in Palestine, earning him the Order of Polonia Restituta. After the war, Brewer returned to Liverpool Royal Infirmary and became an examiner in surgery. Elected president of the university club, he was also member of the Medical Institution and Antiquarian Horological Society. Brewer was a leading consultant surgeon at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, having been appointed a consultant in 1946. In addition, Brewer held senior positions at the Liverpool Homeopathic Hospital, St Helens Hospital, University of Liverpool and Liverpool Dental School. He enjoyed lecturing to dental students until 1978 when he retired. Whilst at Liverpool, Brewer made significant contributions to breast and colorectal surgery. His interest in 'bust and bottoms' led him to establish a breast clinic at Liverpool Royal Infirmary resulting in also being awarded a fellow of the International College of Surgeons. He was the first surgeon to perform an adrenalectomy to treat advanced malignancy.  Personal  Brewer married Marjorie Hirst, who he met during a Compound Fracture reduction in Normandy. They had five children, John, Christine, Jane, Peter and Bi.l. He was a keen angler, starting the hobby at the age of 10 and continuing until near the end of life. He estimated that he had caught more than 25,000 fish during his lifetime. In 1966, he caught five salmon in 45 minutes on the River Eden, Cumbria. At one time, he caught a rainbow trout weighing 13lb, a record for the time. As a member of the Athenaeum Club, London, Brewer made contributions to their committees, particularly in the library committee and its financial stability. He was a collector of antique clocks and old Liverpool pottery, and an active member of the Antiquarian Horological Society. He authored 'The death of kings: a medical history of the kings and queens of England' which considers the likely cause of deaths of past kings and queens of England.

It is one of the many lakes of the Ocna Sibiului mine, a large salt mine which has one of the largest salt reserves in Romania. In the middle of the lake, an islet has been formed. The islet makes the lake unique among the other lakes of the mine. Artemia salina, the inhabitants of the lake Closer look at the island Ocna Sibiului within the Sibiu County  Name  In Romanian, the word auster means austere. The lake is nicknamed Lacul cu insula (lit. the Lake with the Island) because of its island, which makes it unique among the salt mine's lakes.

Biography Ajlan was born around 707 AH (). He was the son of the Emir of Mecca Rumaythah ibn Abi Numayy, who reigned between 1301 and 1345. In 744 AH (1343/1344) Ajlan and his brother Thaqabah purchased the emirate from their elderly father for 60,000 dirhams, without approval from the Mamluk sultan. Consequently, when Thaqabah arrived in Egypt seeking recognition from al-Salih Isma'il, the sultan had him arrested and ordered the emirate returned to Rumaythah. In late Dhu al-Qi'dah (April 1344) Ajlan quit Mecca after receiving news of Thaqabah's capture. He went to Yemen, where he interfered with the passage of jilab (ships) to Mecca, resulting in high inflation during the hajj that year. After the departure of the hajj caravans from the city, Ajlan returned to Mecca and reconciled with his father.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, Itḥāf al-wará, 3/226–227 In Muharram 746 AH (May 1345) Ajlan traveled to Egypt and al-Salih appointed him emir of Mecca in place of his father. He returned to Mecca in Jumada II 746 AH accompanied by 50 mamluks and carrying a decree of appointment from the new sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban (al-Salih died before Ajlan took office). He took over the emirate without bloodshed, and on the evening of 18 Jumada II (15 October 1345) the dua was made for Ajlan and for al-Kamil, and discontinued for Rumaythah.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, Itḥāf al-wará, 3/230 To secure his power Ajlan expelled his brother Thaqabah to Wadi Nakhlah, and his brothers Sanad and Mughamis to Wadi Marr al-Zahran. In early Dhu al-Qi'dah (February/March 1346) he received word from the Sultan's messenger that his brothers had been arrested in Egypt. In 747 AH (1346/1347) or 748 AH (1347/1348) al-Kamil released Thaqabah, Sanad, and Mughamis and appointed them co-rulers with Ajlan. Ajlan was briefly ousted by Thaqabah in 750 AH, but he returned from Egypt on 5 Shawwal 750 AH () and retook the Emirate from his brothers. In Dhu al-Hijjah 752 AH (January 1352) after mediation from the Egyptian amir al- rakab, Ajlan agreed to rule in partnership with Thaqabah. The following year Thaqabah deposed him. In Dhu al-Hijjah 754 AH (January 1353) after Thaqabah refused an offer to share the throne with Ajlan, the Egyptian amir al-rakab Umar Shah arrested him and designated Ajlan sole Emir of Mecca. In Muharram 757 AH (January 1356) Ajlan again agreed to share the Emirate with Thaqabah. On 13 Jumada al-Akhir () Thaqabah deposed him, but when the Hajj arrived (November 1356) Ajlan reentered Mecca and Thaqabah fled. In Dhu al-Hijjah 758 AH (November 1357) the brothers reconciled and Thaqabah returned as co-ruler. In Jumada al-Awwal 760 AH (April 1359) Sultan al-Nasir Hasan summoned Ajlan and Thaqabah to appear before him but they did not do so. The following month they received word that al-Nasir had deposed them and appointed in their place their brother Sanad and their cousin Muhammad ibn Utayfah. Ajlan proposed to Thaqabah that they each give 400 camels to secure the allegiance of the Banu Hasan and preserve their rule. Thaqabah rejected Ajlan's proposal, and Ibn Utayfah assumed the Emirate when he arrived with Egyptian forces in late Jumada al-Akhir (May 1359). Ajlan went to Egypt, but upon his arrival al-Nasir had him arrested and imprisoned. In 762 AH (1361) al-Nasir was killed and replaced by al-Mansur Muhammad. Emir Yalbugha al-Umari released Ajlan and had him reappointed to the Emirate of Mecca in partnership with Thaqabah, who was then coregent with Sanad. In Ramadan (July 1361) Ajlan reached Wadi Marr where he met Thaqabah. Thaqabah was ill, and Ajlan did not proceed to Mecca until early Shawwal 762 AH (August 1361), after Thaqabah's death. Upon assuming the Emirate he ousted Sanad and appointed his own son Ahmad as coregent. In 763 AH (1361/1362) Ajlan conquered Haly Ibn Yaqub, a feat not accomplished by any Sharif of Mecca before him since Abu al-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far (r. 994–1039). In 774 AH (1372) Ajlan relinquished full control of the Emirate to Ahmad, though his name continued to be mentioned alongside his son's in the khutbah until his death. He died at al-Jadid in Wadi Marr on Monday night, 11 Jumada al-Ula 777 AH (7–8 October 1375) and was buried in al-Ma'lah cemetery, where a qubba was built over his grave.

Though they succeeded in submitting draft legislations, change was slow to occur. After six years, the organization disbanded and the women funneled their efforts into other international feminist organizations. History In May, 1923, during the International Women Suffrage Alliance Ninth Conference of Rome women from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), Poland, and Romania joined to form the Little Entente of Women (LEW). Based on the military and political organization, the Little Entente, the women's network was established to form alliances between women in other Balkan nations, primarily countries which had formerly been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and combat the marginalization they experienced within the international women’s movement. It was one of the first alliances of Eastern European women which attempted to shift feminist action in their countries away from the Westernized international women’s movement, which characterized them as backward and undeveloped. Alexandrina Cantacuzino was the driving force behind forming the alliance and became its first president, serving between 1923 and 1924. Serbian feminist Mileva Petrović followed Cantacuzino as president, Greek feminist Avra Theodoropoulou served from 1925 to 1927 and in 1927, Polish physician Justyna Budzińska-Tylicka became the chair. Unlike the male counterpart, the women's organization had no military objectives and were open about the need to improve the socio- economic, cultural and political access of all members. It was important for them to include states which had already granted woman's suffrage, Poland (1918) and Czechoslovakia (1920), as it was hoped that through their experiences Czech and Polish women could assist with expanding their nationalist goals to the neighboring states. The governing board was initially made up of members: from Czechoslovakia—Františka Plamínková, a member of the Prague Municipal Council; , deputy; B. Šmeralová and ; from Greece—Alexandria Ionides and Theodoropoulou; from Poland—Budzińska-Tylicka, a member of the Warsaw Municipal Council; from Romania—Calypso Botez, who served as LEW treasurer; Cantacuzino, the president of LEW; Catherine Cerkez, who served as secretary of the LEW; and Eugenia de Reuss Ianculescu; from Yugoslavia—Milena Atanacković (also known as Milena Atanatskovitch) and J. Petković Maksimović. Between 1924 and 1929 four conferences were held for women to meet and discuss issues, such as abolishing capital punishment, child labor, employment protections, illegitimacy, peace initiatives, and suffrage of the member countries. The conferences were held in Belgrade (1924), Athens (1925), Prague (1927) and Warsaw (1929). At the second conference, held in Athens, women reported their progress for the year. The Polish delegates were unable to attend, but a report was read by LEW secretary Ksenija Atanasijević to report that the women had filed a draft with the legislature to address illegitimacy and were working with local police to establish women officers to address prostitution and at risk girls. Plamínková reported that Czech women had been working with schools and attempting to improve their sanitation, as well as offering hygiene and housekeeping courses to women and girls and working on alimony issues for divorced women. The Romanian delegate, Cantacuzino, reported that work was ongoing to reform the Civil Code with relation to mothers and children and that a conference had been scheduled to unite feminists in the Banatian, Bukovinian, and Transylvanian regions. Maria Negreponti reported that limited suffrage for women would become legal in two years and that they had been given the right to defend themselves in court under certain circumstances. Mira Kočonda reported that in Yugoslavia women were working to change the marital provisions in the Civil Code but had made headway in uniting various women's groups across the country. In essence, progress was being made, but it was slow. The women discussed work in the civil service, pensions, alimony and divorce, disability, women's education and the death penalty. They also discussed worsening economic conditions throughout the region. In 1927, the women voted to open membership to Albania and Turkey though implementation did not occur. They were also interested in recruiting women from Hungary to improve the diplomatic relationships throughout the area and invited women from those countries to participate in their conferences. After 1929, the organization dwindled and eventually became inactive. Members included activists like Vinko Šperac Bulić, Zofia Daszyńska- Golińska, Anna Papadimitriou, Ivande Kaija, Jelka Perić, Alojzija Štebi, Maria Svolou, Angela Vode, Maša Živanović, among others, who afterward continued their involvement in the international feminist movement.

He began his career in his home country, competing with Þór Akureyri. Tryggvi is a regular member of the Icelandic national team, with experience at EuroBasket. Early life Tryggvi was raised on the Svartárkot farm, a sheep facility in the municipality of Þingeyjarsveit, an area of northeastern Iceland so isolated that his family's closest neighbors live away, and there is no grocery store within an hour's drive of the farm. In a 2017 ESPN story, Jón Arnór Stefánsson, one of the country's greatest players, said about the area where Tryggvi was raised, \\"It's a situation you can't explain to a person that doesn't live in Iceland or that part of the country. When the weather is harsh, you can't really get to or from it, so you're just stuck up there. It's a unique story, man.\\" Tryggvi himself would say in a 2018 interview with Yahoo Sports, \\"There was always work to do on the farm, but the freedom you have is insane. It's so far to the next house that you can do whatever you like and nobody really cares.\\" One of his youth basketball coaches, Águst Guðmundsson, added that during winter, driving to and from the farm was sometimes impossible for two weeks or more at a time, even with four-wheel drive vehicles. During such conditions, the only access to the farm is by snowmobile. In 2013, his parents decided to send him to secondary school in Akureyri, the main town of northern Iceland. The country has no basketball program in its secondary schools; his parents planned to have him learn as much as he could, especially in the electrical field, in order for him to help improve their farm operations. Shortly after his arrival in Akureyri, he called Bjarki Ármann Oddsson, then head coach of the under-17 team of Icelandic league club Þór Akureyri, wishing to give basketball a try—even though he owned no basketball shoes, and had never seen live full-court basketball. The coaches at Þór, plus Einar Jóhannsson, head coach of the Iceland U-18 national team, convinced Tryggvi's parents that he had a future in the sport. Professional career =Þór Akureyri (2014–2017)= Tryggvi signed with Division I club Þór Akureyri in 2014. He played sparingly during the first half of the season but averaged 10.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5.1 blocks in the final 8 games. In his second season, he averaged 12.8 points, 9.0 rebounds and 3.5 blocks and helped Þór Akureyri win Division I and achieve promotion to the Úrvalsdeild, the top tier league in Iceland. After the season he was named to the Division I Domestic All-first team and as the D1 Young Player of the Year. Throughout his third and final season with Þór Akureyri, he led the Úrvalsdeild in blocked shots. =Valencia Basket (2017–2019)= In June 2017, Tryggvi signed with reigning Liga ACB champions, Valencia Basket. On September 23, 2017, he won the Spanish Supercup with Valencia. In December 2017 it was revealed that he finish second in voting for the Icelandic Men's Basketball Player of the Year award, after Martin Hermannsson. Throughout his first season with Valencia, Tryggvi would split his playing time between Valencia and their Liga EBA affiliate squad where he averaged 11.7 points and 9.8 rebounds. In June 2019, Valencia released Tryggvi from his contract. NBA On April 16, 2018, Tryggvi declared for the 2018 NBA draft, for which ESPN considered him a potential second-round pick. He was one of only 11 truly international players to declare for that year's draft early. He would ultimately go undrafted. He played for the Toronto Raptors during the 2018 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, appearing in two games for them. Loan to Obradoiro CAB (2018–2019) Tryggvi spent the 2016–17 on a loan to Obradoiro where he averaged 3.5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 33 games in the Liga ACB. =Basket Zaragoza (2019–present)= On July 9, 2019, Tryggvi signed a three-year deal with Spanish club Zaragoza. Icelandic national team Tryggvi was selected to the Icelandic men's national team in 2016 and helped Iceland qualify for FIBA EuroBasket 2017, which was their second appearance in the nation's history. He was also member of the Icelandic U20 national team that competed in the 2017 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, where he was named member of the All- Tournament Team. He led the tournament in blocks and efficiency, while coming in third in rebounds and seventh in scoring.

He is considered as one of the pioneers in Biological Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bio- NMR) and his research has been focused on protein structure, dynamics and stability, and on the relation of these to protein function. He is a structural biologist and is recognized for his work on the development of NMR spectroscopy for determination of protein structures in solution and characterizing protein dynamics.  Education and Early life  Wagner was born in 1945 in Bor, Czech republic but grew up in Southern Bavaria . He was the first to receive a college education in his family. Born to a blue-collar family, after WWII in the German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia, his family was forced to leave and ended up in Southern Bavaria, where he grew up. Due to his school records he could go to a humanistic gymnasium, an institution that teaches classical antiquity specifically, and received an education with nine years of Latin and six years of classical Greek but also a good education in math and some physics. There, he had an excellent math/physics teacher and became fascinated with physics. Wagner was educated in a classical humanistic high school (humanistic Gymnasium in Germany).  Career and research  Wagner studied Physics at the Technical University in Munich with work on Mossbauer spectroscopy of iron-containing proteins. He pursued his PhD in Biophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich where he graduated in 1977 with studies of protein dynamics, measuring rates of aromatic ring flips and hydrogen exchange. After graduation, he spent six months at the chemistry department of MIT to explore solid state NMR. After this he went to the laboratory of Kurt Wüthrich at the ETH in Zürich. There he continued to work on solution NMR of proteins. He learned about the nuclear Overhauser effect (nOe) and developed procedures assigning specific NMR resonances to individual amino acids in the sequence of proteins. He was the first to completely assign the resonances of an entire protein, basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. This became the foundation of solving protein structures in solution by NMR. The first structure he determined was for rabbit metallothioneine 2. When he and his team were ready to publish it, a crystal structure was reported for the same protein but was entirely different from his topology. After intensive scrutiny of his data it became clear that his structure was correct, and the crystal structure was not. This made the crystallographers aware of him, and he received offers for faculty positions at Duke, the University of Michigan, and the University of Minnesota. He accepted the position at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as associate professor with tenure in 1987. Before his arrival in Michigan, he had ordered construction of a triple resonance probe for his new spectrometer. This allowed pulsing 1H, 13C, and 15N. After the probe was delivered in 1988, he developed triple resonance methods for conformation- independent sequential assignments of proteins. This has become the basis for today’s resonance assignments of proteins and structure determination of proteins in solution up to 50 kDa and above. Due to this achievement, Dr. Wagner was offered a full professorship, with tenure, by Harvard Medical School where he has been since 1990. After joining the Harvard faculty, he started research on the initiation of mRNA translation into a protein. After a gene is transcribed into mRNA, a large protein complex attaches to the 5’ end of the mRNA begin the process of transcription. In a 2003 Cell paper, Wagner’s lab reported the structure of the first two proteins in this complex, eIF4E and eIF4G, and how they enable the ribosome to bind to the 5’ end of mRNA and start making protein. In 2017, a research team led by Wagner reported an improved design for tiny nanodiscs; synthetic models of cell membranes used to study proteins that control what enters and leaves a cell. The enhancements provide an unprecedented view of how viruses infect cells.

Dutta is an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Career  = University of Michigan-Flint = Dutta was appointed chancellor of the University of Michigan - Flint on June 20, 2019 with a term beginning August 1, 2019. Dutta has been part of University of Michigan since the beginning of his career. Dutta started his teaching career as assistant professor of mechanical engineering and was promoted to professor in 2000. He also was director of the College of Engineering's Program in Manufacturing and director of interdisciplinary professional programs. He returned to The University of Michigan to the Flint campus after serving as the chancellor of Rutgers University. = Rutgers University-New Brunswick = Dutta was appointed chancellor of Rutgers University-New Brunswick in July 2017. As Chancellor of Rutgers University-New Brunswick, Dutta led the largest Rutgers campus with over 40,000 students, 2,000 faculty and 5,000 staff. He engaged the New Brunswick Faculty Council on wide range of issues soliciting their input and ideas. The Faculty Council viewed him as \\"a model for how administrators should interact with faculty in shared governance relationships.” Dutta created a new administrative structure for the campus to bring focus and accountability to key functional areas. He oversaw the matriculation of the largest first-year class in history, the reversal of a three-year decline in research funding and increased alumni engagement. Dutta worked extensively with state legislators, business and community leaders to create institutional momentum around student success, affordability and academic excellence. On July 25, 2018, Dutta announced his resignation as chancellor in an email to the Rutgers community citing misalignment of vision for the chancellorship. President Barchi, in his 2018 Report to the University Senate, mentioned that the role of the Rutgers-New Brunswick chancellor does not easily correspond to common job titles at other university systems. He wrote, \\"I am grateful to Dr. Dutta for the year that he served as chancellor at Rutgers–New Brunswick, for the programs he initiated to move the university to a new level of excellence, and for his passionate support of the students.\\" In an article by Inside Higher Ed, Rutgers Faculty Council Executive Committee members said Dutta \\"seemed to listen and was responsive\\" and that as chancellor he \\"galvanized faculty members to work toward a vision of community.\\" Several faculty members told the publication they were sad to see him leave the position. = Purdue University = Starting in July 2014, Dutta served as Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs at Purdue University. In July 2015, he also assumed the role of Chief Diversity Officer for Purdue. His significant contributions to academic excellence, diversity and student success at Purdue were recognized by a Resolution of Appreciation adopted by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. When it was announced Dutta would leave Purdue for Rutgers, Purdue President Mitch Daniels said of Dutta, \\"He has made an enormous and positive difference for Purdue and has proven himself an effective change agent in a sector where such people are scarce. Immensely talented leaders often attract the attention of others and so it is in this case.\\" = University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign = Dutta served as Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate College from January 2009 until June 2014. He was responsible for facilitating and nurturing interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary connections, assuring integrity and quality of graduate programs, and providing essential graduate student services. In 2011, he chaired the steering committee for Stewarding Excellence at Illinois, an institution-wide program for cost control and organizational efficiency created in the face of falling state revenues. He also chaired a campus-wide committee to assess doctoral education at Illinois including the size, quality, effectiveness, demand, and operational costs of individual doctoral programs. At Illinois, he was Edward and Jane Marr Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering. As a Scholar in Residence at the National Academy of Engineering, Dutta completed two projects—The Lifelong Learning Imperative in Engineering study, completed and published in 2012, and the Educate to Innovate study, completed and published in 2014. = National Science Foundation = In 2004, Dutta was tapped by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to lead Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT), the flagship graduate education and research traineeship program at NSF.

It originates in the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve. The Yamachiche River flows mostly in a wooded area north of Charette, and then generally in an agricultural environment on the rest of its course.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes of the Yamachiche River are: * To the east: the otters river and the clay river; * The west: the Little Yamachiche River and the River of Loup (Mauricie). The main body of water at the head of the Yamachiche River is the \\"Great Long Lake\\" (length: oriented from north to south, altitude: ) located in the municipality of Saint-Élie. He obtains water from three landfills: * To the northeast: that of Lake Gareau (length: , altitude of ), whose discharge flows south. This lake is located in the municipality of Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc; * To the north: that of the Little Lake Gareau (length: , the South. This lake located in the municipality of Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc also receives the waters of Lake Vanasse (altitude: ) on the north side. * To the northwest: that of a small lake (length: ; altitude: ) whose discharge is (length: ; altitude: ) flowing to the south and receiving the waters by: ** north of Bournival Lake (length: ; altitude: ) whose discharge descends on ; ** the southwest of the Racquet Lake (length: , altitude: ) whose discharge is . This lake receives from the north the waters of the Second Racquet Lake (length of ; altitude: ) whose discharge is also . Riverside downstream from Grand Lac Long The Great Lake Long dump is located at the bottom of a bay south of the lake. From there, the Yamachiche River flows on: About 40 m in the \\"Petit lac Long\\" (length: 480 m, altitude: 176 m), which flows through 340 m west; 240 m by crossing under a road bridge to go into the Lake Perchaud (length: 1,4 km, altitude: 175 m); 860 m by crossing the lake at la Perchaud, from the north-west to the southeast. A dam has been erected at its mouth. The Lac à la Perchaude receives through its west point the waters of a series of lakes upstream on the north side: Lac des Chutes (length: 0.8 km that the current crosses over 0.6 km, altitude: 209 m) Lac Fer à Cheval (length: 1.0 km from one end to the other, altitude: 209 m), and Lake to the island (length: 1,6 km, altitude: 229 m). In short, the Second Lac Raquette is the highest lake (233 m) of the watershed of the Yamachiche River; The second being the lake on the Island (229 m); the third being Bournival Lake (220 m). The course of the river downstream from the lake to the perch From the perch lake, the river descends 260 meters to the south and flows into Lake Garand (length: 1.2 km facing south, elevation: 172 m). Then the river descends 3.9 km southwest through the village of Saint-Élie to the mouth of the Paterson Lake Creek. From there, the river descends 4.7 km south to the limit of the municipality of Charette, Quebec. The river then descends to the south, then turns eastwards to cross the village of Charette. Then the river cuts the southwestern limit of Saint-Boniface-de-Shawinigan before crossing Saint-Étienne-des-Grès where it collects the waters of the Machiche River, where it branches off to the southwest. Then its route serves as the limit between Saint-Étienne-des-Grès and Saint-Barnabé. The river continues southward through the farmland west of the village of Saint-Thomas-de-Caxton. Downstream, the river passes east of the village of Yamachiche to its estuary in Lake Saint-Pierre, where there is also a point and a cove of the same name, 25 km upstream from Trois-Rivières. In addition, the \\"Petite rivière Yamachiche\\" runs for 16 km parallel to the west side; This river takes its source in the area of Saint-Barnabé-Nord. This twin river drains the area of the village of Ymachiche and then flows into Lake Saint-Pierre, 1.5 km upstream from the mouth of the main river.  Toponymy  In the past, this river was called \\"Rivière Grosbois\\" because it drains the territory of this former lordship, and \\"Grande Rivière\\" or \\"Rivière d'Yamachiche\\".

The site was before that occupied by the Monson House, a 19th-century boarding house.  The Monson House  The original Monson hotel was established by Captain Anthony Vincent \\"Bossy\\" Monson and his wife Florence Young in the 1880s, not long before the opening of the Flagler hotels made the city a luxury destination. Monson was a Saint Augustine native raised at 56 Marine Street (now known as the González-Jones House). Born in 1854, he was the youngest of eight children, including William F Monson, who became a notable architect/builder in Mandarin, Florida. His mother was Laurenna Leonardy, a Minorcan descendant of the Bonelly and Leonardy families who were original colonists in Andrew Turnbull's expedition at New Smyrna, Florida. Leonardy married William Monson (Anton Bengt Osmundsen), who had immigrated to America in 1836 from Stavanger, Norway. The first Monson House was on the water's edge at 24 Bay Street (now Avenida Menendez), between the Plaza and Fort Marion. An 1885 advertisement claimed rooms for ten boarders at $9-$10/week. In addition to rented rooms, the Monson offered tourists a chance to sail to the Saint Augustine Lighthouse on Anastasia Island on one of four yachts anchored near the club house. > The visitor to St. Augustine should consider the sojourn incomplete without > a sail in the harbor and over in the beach where one can climb the stairs to > the top of the light-house on Anastasia Island, and get a magnificent view > of the ocean on one side and the town on the other. In order to do this, it > will be necessary to engage one of Captain Monson's yachts, Mamie, Maria, > Traveller or Ocrenba. which are at anchor near the club-house. Captain > Monson is a native of St. Augustine and about 58 years of age. He is also > proprietor of a boarding house which can accommodate ten guests at $1.50 per > day from $9 to $10 per week. This first house burned in an 1895 fire. The second Monson House was located at 26 Bay Street next to Brava Lane. Open all year, the rates were $1.50 to $2.00 per day with $7.00 to 12.00 per week. Residents could enjoy hot and cold baths. The hotel was again enlarged in 1901 and in 1912, when the capacity was advertised at 75. The final wooden hotel fell victim to the April 1914 fire that started at the Florida House and destroyed everything from Saint George Street to the Bay. The fire claimed four hotels, the opera house, the courthouse, and countless homes and businesses. The Monson was replaced by a masonry structure that opened on January 5, 1915. Monson died later that year, and his brother-in-law Charles E Young Sr became manager of the new hotel. The Monson was enlarged in 1916 with an addition to the south side that almost doubled its size. The Monson Hotel remained a fixture on Saint Augustine's bay front until 1960, when it was demolished and replaced by the Monson Motor Lodge. That structure was eventually razed as well, and in 2003 reopened as the Hilton Bayfront Hotel. It remains under Hilton's management today, with 72 rooms spread over 19 small buildings. During excavations prior to construction of the Hilton's underground parking garage, archeologists found evidence of colonial foundations from Saint Augustine's British Period (1763–1784).  Civil Rights Movement  In the spring of 1964, Robert Hayling worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to recruit college students to come to Saint Augustine for spring break to take part in civil rights activities. Martin Luther King Jr. of the SCLC was arrested on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge restaurant, June 11, 1964. He wrote a \\"Letter from the Saint Augustine Jail\\" to his friend, Israel S. Dresner, in New Jersey, encouraging rabbis to come to Saint Augustine and take part in the movement. The result was the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history, which occurred June 18 at the Monson. Days later, black and white activists jumped into the Monson swimming pool in defiance of segregation ordinances. The manager of the hotel, James Brock, responded by pouring muriatic acid into the water to drive the \\"wade in\\" protestors out. Photographs of this action, and of a police officer jumping into the pool to arrest the young activists, were broadcast around the world and became some of the most famous images of the movement. On June 30, Florida Governor Farris Bryant announced the formation of a biracial committee to restore interracial communication in Saint Augustine. National SCLC leaders left Saint Augustine on July 1, the day before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. The motel and pool were demolished in March 2003, despite five years of protests, thus eliminating one of the nation's important landmarks of the civil rights movement.St. Augustine Record: March 18, 2003-Demolition begins on Monson Inn by Ken Lewis The Hilton Bayfront Hotel was built on the site. Today, the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge have been preserved with a plaque to commemorate King's activism in the city.

The collaboration came about after RTÉ contacted contemporary Irish composer Niall Vallely, requesting he composed music for a traditional group, and Vallely in turn requested Lúnasa for a collaboration, bringing the two ensembles together for a fusion between traditional and classical music. After the two groups performed at the National Concert Hall, Dublin, in April 2012, they recorded the album later in the year. The music on the album is Vallely's rearrangement of various suites and tunes, both traditional and modern, that Lúnasa had performed in the past. Music critics have noted the dynamic of the album, where neither the orchestral and traditional elements of the recording outweigh each other. Lúnasa member Trevor Hutchinson is said to pivot the two genres together with his double bass playing. The album was well received by music critics, with journalists complimenting the spirit and fusion of the music. The collaboration allowed Lúnasa to reuse music that they had tired years before the recording of the album. In promotion of the album, Lúnasa toured in the United States and United Kingdom, as well as undergoing a major venue tour. Background and recording The genesis for the collaboration between Lúnasa and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra came when contemporary Irish composer Niall Vallely was asked by Irish service broadcaster RTÉ to curate arrangements for usage in a traditional band. According to one biography, Vallely was \\"the perfect fit for this adventurous undertaking\\" due to having composed both traditional and classical compositions. Vallely suggested Celtic folk group Lúnasa, which features his brother Cillian Vallely on pipes, for the project, and the project subsequently evolved into Lúnasa playing with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, conducted by David Brophy, creating an unusual fusion between traditional and classical music. One biography noted that the collaboration allowed Niall to expand Lúnasa's \\"innovative use of harmony and rhythm,\\" taking advantage of the harmonic and rhythmic potential of \\"the full orchestral sound. The result is truly a new sound in Irish music.\\" The initial performance between the two ensembles was on 19 June 2012 at the National Concert Hall, Dublin, which was recorded and broadcast on RTÉ's leading national station RTÉ Radio 1. The concert, titled \\"Music, Movement and the Brain,\\" was part of the sixteenth Movement Disorder Society congress and featured Niall's new arrangements of Lúnasa's music for the two ensembles to play together. Journal of Music described the concept of the performance as an \\"interesting departure in and of itself.\\" Later in the year, the band followed the concert with the recording of the Lúnasa with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra album. According to the November 2013 issue of Folk World, the album was recorded at Dublin's RTÉ Studios. Recording the album allowed Lúnasa to continue exploring \\"new directions in the world of Irish traditional music;\\" band member Kevin Crawford commented: \\"Thankfully, the huge melting pot of music that exists within the Irish tradition allows us to seek out exciting and unexplored melodies that work for a band like ourselves. This combined with the newer self composed pieces and strong belief in what we do help to keep both the band and the tradition very much alive and kicking.\\" Composition Lúnasa with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra features nine sets, \\"with traditional as well as modern tunes;\\" the pieces are Niall's rearrangements of sets originally played by Lúnasa alone. As is often the case with traditional Celtic folk albums, including previous Lúnasa albums, each track on the album \\"is compiled of several airs, jigs and reels.\\" While Niall's arrangements are \\"grand and symphonic,\\" they nonetheless \\"frame and support individual and group contributions from Lúnasa with a sure, often sublime touch.\\" The plucked and bowed double bass of Lúnasa member Trevor Hutchinson serves as the \\"sonic and symbolic pivot between the two genres [classical and Irish folk],\\" while also expanding the depth and range \\"of the ensemble's sound.\\" RJ Lannan of Zone Music Reporter said multiple genres are used on the album's reels, \\"namely Celtic, Irish, folk, and classical,\\" and described the album's sound as \\"a balance of yesterday and today.\\" Several reviewers have said that the recording establishes an even balance between the traditional and orchestral instruments, rather than one element dominating the other; Tara Dougherty of Irish America said \\"the orchestra adds a gusto to the traditional songs that never overpowers Lúnasa's unique voice; rather, the arrangements seem dedicated only to enhancing it,\\" while Caith Threefires of Bass Player said \\"it's as if the orchestra were led by the band on a stroll through the Emerald Isle countryside, rather than the band becoming a Celtic ornament in the concert hall.\\" Reviewer Neil King felt that the music occasionally gets \\"competitive\\", meaning that \\"neither outfit ends up getting subsumed into the narrow world of the other, you can feel the way both units approach folk music, where they differ and where they compliment.\\" Deanne Sole of PopMatters felt \\"both parties in this partnership respect one another’s roles—Lúnasa the folk band representing the value of small piercing personalities, the RTÉ Concert Orchestra representing the value of smooth mass group sound.\\" =Sets= The traditional Asturian air \\"Casu\\", which originates from the Iberian part of Celtic lands, begins the album and \\"features flute and guitar with a resounding backup from the orchestra\\"; the piece was previously recorded by Lúnasa on their third album The Merry Sisters of Fate (2001). Three other sets on the album also appeared on The Merry Sisters of Fate, namely \\"The Minor Bee\\", \\"The Merry Sisters of Fate\\" and \\"Morning Nightcap.\\" According to one critic, the influence that Cillian Valley had on Lord of the Dance is apparent on his dramatic \\"Leckan Mór\\". Described as \\"a perfect showcase for Cillian's fine piping,\\" the poignant and melancholy \\"An Buachaillín Bán (With Scully's)\\" is an eleven minute suite, which is brought \\"to a rhythmic and orchestral finale\\" by \\"Scully Casey's\\" and \\"The Dusty Miller.\\" \\"Morning Nightcap\\" is opened by Donald Shaw's \\"MacLeod's Farewell.\\" PopMatters said: \\"The individual fiddle and pipe go skipping near the end of 'Morning Nightcap' and the cushion of strings rolls massively after them like a willing St Bernard.\\" The \\"Breton Set\\", so named because it features Breton folk dance music, features \\"virtuoso flute playing\\" and \\"fine orchestral arrangements.\\" \\"The Minor Bee\\" suite, which consists of the three pieces \\"Minor Slip\\", \\"Loudeac Ronde\\" and \\"The Red Bee,\\" has been described as an \\"animated\\" trilogy. \\"The Merry Sisters of Fate\\" begins with a double bass and fiddle introduction by Hutchinson and Seán Smyth and proceeds into \\"a final musical firework with 3 traditional dance tunes.\\" Release On 30 January 2013, Lúnasa released a press release announcing the album. \\"Expect [the album] to reconfigure more than a few musical maps via the intersection between Irish music orchestral and Irish music traditional,\\" the press release announced. The band's first album in three years, Lúnasa with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra was released digitally on 17 March 2013 to coincide with St. Patrick's Day, followed by a physical release in the United Kingdom and United States by Lúnasa Records on 16 April 2013. In the US, the album was distributed via City Hall Distributors. The CD features a bonus Enhanced CD element, featuring the music video of the performance of \\"Morning Nightcap\\" from the National Concert Hall performance. A live film clip from the National Hall Performance, directed by award-winning director Myles O'Reilly, was produced by Lúnasa and released on 17 March 2013 to promote the album. Also to promote the album, Lúnasa began a month long tour of the US on 22 February, followed \\"by UK festival appearances and [a] major venue tour.\\" Interviewed at the time of the album's release and subsequent touring, Seán Smyth said that \\"as for the future, there are many, many musical journeys left open to us. For now, we're going to savor the orchestral theme and look forward to recreating these wonderful arrangements in theatres and with audiences around the world.\\" Critical reception Lúnasa with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra was released to positive reviews from music critics. Tara Dougherty of Irish America said, \\"combining the lively thrill of Lúnasa with the awe-inspiring power of one of Ireland’s most celebrated orchestras results in a powerhouse record that will delight Lúnasa fans and entice classical fans into the world of Irish music.\\" James Christopher Monger of AllMusic rated the album three and a half stars out of five and complimented the \\"stirring performances.\\" Caith Threefires of Bass Player called it \\"a flawless and moving performance\\" and noted the album's \\"defining nuances\\" help it avoid becoming \\"subverted and washed out\\" because the \\"beautifully arranged\\" music is performed \\"as if the orchestra were led by the band on a stroll through the Emerald Isle countryside, rather than the band becoming a Celtic ornament in the concert hall.\\" Michael Quinn of Songlines said \\"Vallely’s arrangements are grand and symphonic but they manage to frame and support individual and group contributions from Lunasa with a sure, often sublime touch.\\" R J Lannan, writing for Zone Music Reporter's \\"The Sounding Board\\" column, rated the album an \\"excellent\\" 5/5 rating and said: \\"The music is more than just a swaree. The pairing of a full- bodied orchestra and a band of talented traditionalists makes for some extraordinary entertainment.\\" Neil King of Fatea Records said \\"this is one of the best folk and orchestra combinations I've heard and leave it at that, the arrangements are simply sublime.\\" In issue 52 of Folkworld, the album was seen as the exemplifying the band's \\"musical horizon\\" being widened. More reserved in her praise, Deanne Sole of PopMatters rated the album 6/10, saying that although the album is not \\"brilliant\\", it is \\"talented.\\" Legacy Lúnasa's collaboration with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra allowed Lúnasa to reuse music that they had retired many years before. \\"A number of the pieces had been banished to the wilderness,\\" explained Crawford, \\"destined never to see the light of a Lúnasa day ever again. Getting the opportunity to dust them down and hear them in a totally new environment gave the tunes a whole new lease of life and reawakened our love and respect for them. It's an experience I certainly never thought I'd encounter as a traditional Irish musician.\\" According to Rob Adams of the Herald Scotland, the collaboration allowed Niall Vallely to discover Lúnasa's performance dynamic: \\"As [Niall Vallely] found when writing the score for their recent collaboration with the RTE Concert Orchestra, Lunasa makes a very complete sound in its own right without over- playing or driving the music too hard.\\" Lúnasa with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra has been described as \\"groundbreaking.\\" While Deanne Sole of PopMatters compared it with the Indian and Western classical fusion album Samaagam (2011), a collaboration between Amjad Ali Khan and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the album was also described in 2014 by Ceili editor Chuck Bloom as the first of two recent Celtic CDs that \\"have brought symphony orchestras into the fold within the past year,\\" the second being Live in Washington, D.C., a collaboration between American Rogues and the United States Air Force Symphony.

Upon completion, it will be the largest shipyard in the world. Development of the facility began in November 2015, when Saudi Arabian oil and gas company Saudi Aramco and South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding development of marine industry in Saudi Arabia, including a large shipyard. In January 2016, it was announced that the partnership to construct the shipyard had expanded with the signing of an MoU between the National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia, Maritime Offshore Limited (a Lamprell subsidiary), Saudi Aramco, and HHI. The consortium subsequently signed a joint development agreement in June to undertake feasibility analysis of the shipyard, which had by then been confirmed to be sited in Ras Al-Khair. Royal HaskoningDHV and Hyundai Engineering & Construction were awarded a design contract for the facility in October 2016, and the ceremonial groundbreaking took place on 29 November 2016, although the first major construction contract, for dredging on site preparation, was not signed until May 2017. In November 2017, Saudi Aramco awarded China Power Construction Group a $3 billion contract to build the shipyard facilities. Total construction costs are estimated to be about US$4.3 billion. The complex is scheduled to open in stages from late 2018 through 2022, when it will reach full capacity. When complete, the facility is estimated to increase the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia by $17 billion, while decreasing the country's imports by $12 billion and supporting 80,000 jobs nationally. The facility will be about in area, with several dry docks and at least 15 separate piers. It will have four major areas of operation--shipbuilding, ship repair, oil rig construction, and oil rig support. In July 2017, Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop with Saudi Aramco and investment company Dussur a $400 million factory to build medium speed marine diesel engines at the complex. In January 2018, the anchor facility at the complex, a shipyard named International Maritime Industries, was incorporated with orders for at least 20 oil rigs and 50 ships.

She wrote many stories, sketches, and poems. Born in Boston, Griswold relocated with her family to Columbus, Wisconsin, in 1850, where, in the course of time, she married, raised her children, and did much of her work as an author. Her home was a meeting place of many of the notable people of the day, for she had an extensive personal acquaintance with literary and other celebrities. She died in Columbus in 1909. The books by which she is best-known are: Apple Blossoms, Waiting on Destiny, Lucile and Her Friends, and The Home Life of Great Authors. \\"Under the Daisies\\" is one of her best-known poems. She wrote stories for the Home Journal of New York, The Knickerbocker, Madison State Journal, Old and New, The Christian Register, and Boston Commonwealth. Griswold served as president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in her locale. Griswold died in Wisconsin in 1909. Early years and education Hattie Tyng was born in Boston, Massachusetts, January 26, 1842 (1840 is also mentioned). Her father, Rev. Dudley Tyng, was a Universalist minister. He was a bookworm and a dreamer, very poetic by nature, but never penned his inspirations in aught save sermons. He was born in Maine, where the earlier years of Griswold's life were spent. Her mother's maiden name was Sarah Haines. She was a native of New York, with a keen knowledge of human nature, a great fund of incisive sarcasm, love of argument and disputation upon religious and intellectual themes, and boundless pity for the poor and suffering. Both parents were New Englanders. They were Universalists, converted by Hosea Ballou, in Boston, in early life, and abolitionists. Griswold's unusual inheritance of the poetic gift and intense practicality combined may be traced as a cross between her father's ideality and her mother's Puritanical attention to actual details. Of her parents, Griswold wrote: \\"Religion absorbed all his mind and all his heart, and left little for practical life. Both embraced Universalism, in its earliest and weakest days, and fought for it with the aggressiveness of the early days to the end.\\" She was about 11 when her parents settled in Columbus, Wisconsin and she spent the rest of her life there. Soon after their removal, she commenced writing for the local papers, and by her friends, was considered a prodigy. She first wrote for the New Covenant when it was under the control of the Rev. Lemuel Bickford Mason. When the Home Journal of New York was under the control of Nathaniel Parker Willis, and The Knickerbocker was the leading magazine of the country, Griswold, a mere girl, was a contributor to both. When 14 years old, she began to attract attention as one marked with literary ability by her short stories and poems in the Madison State Journal. She also wrote for The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky. Career \\"Apple-blossoms\\" (1874) \\"Waiting on Destiny: A Story for Girls\\" (1889) \\"Home Life of Great Authors\\" (1897) \\"Personal sketches of recent authors\\" (1898) =Writer= Her acquaintance with Mason led to her becoming a member of his family when she was about 18 years old, and she passed several months teaching school in Winnetka, Illinois, where he resided. Very soon after, Rev. Daniel Parker Livermore took the editorial charge of the New Covenant, and Griswold began a pleasant acquaintance with his wife, Mary A. Livermore, who assisted her in many ways, with kindness and attention. Griswold was now an established contributor to Willis' New York Home Journal and Charles Godfrey Leland's Knickerbocker Magazine. She had established a permanent friendship with both of these editors, which was pleasant and useful to her. Willis said of her: \\"Her imaginings are delicate, and the simplicity with which she expresses her thoughts charms me.\\" She was at this time writing stories for several papers and periodicals, for which she received remuneration, such as Old and New, The Christian Register, Boston Commonwealth, and other publications. In 1868, in the spirit of Universalism. she wrote a long story, entitled \\"Fate and Faith.\\" It was published as a serial in the \\"Ladies' Repository\\"; it was a struggle after the \\"eternal verities of God and immortality\\". Griswold continued to be a regular contributor to the New Covenant after John Wesley Hanson took control, in 1869, until it united with The Star in the West, continuing to communicate with the public through its pages in prose and verse. The first edition of her poems, Apple Blossoms, was published in Milwaukee, by Strickland, in 1874; the second edition by Jansen, McClurg & Co., Chicago, in 1877. Some of these poems had been published previously, and others had not. A book review stated the book was one of rare merit, with an undertone of sadness, a refrain of grief and pathos, running through all her poems; but their lesson was always of patience and resignation and hope, rather than despondency or despair. Their sadness was that of life and of a woman's heart, when it has known \\"a sorrow's crown of sorrows,\\" such as is portrayed in 'Three Kisses'.\\" Home Life of Great Authors, published in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses of their home life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Edgar Allan Poe, Eliot, Robert Burns, De Quincey, North, Washington Irving, Thomas Carlyle, Macaulay, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Brontë, Thackeray, Charles Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, William Cullen Bryant, Victor Hugo, Lytton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Charles Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view of men and women well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time when she was a girl getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors. In her time, none of the women poets of America wrote anything more widely known or popular of its class than Griswold's short poem, \\"Under the Daisies\\". The song later appeared in an American periodical, extracted from its source by numerous newspapers throughout the country, but unfortunately the name of its author was not given. In this way, it was copied by almost the entire press of the US and England, and became immensely popular. Conjectures were made as to its authorship, and query editors of newspapers and magazines were appealed to, but the authorship of the poem had been lost. It was in this uncredited state that it fell under the attention of Harrison Millard, the composer, who in turn set it to music. As a ballad, it renewed its popularity. It later transpired that the authorship of the song belonged to Griswold. The discovery was brought to the attention of Millard, who wrote the author assuring Griswold that thereafter, her name would be attached to the ballad in all subsequent editions or forms in which it might be issued. Personal Sketches of Recent Authors contained sketches of Tennyson, Arnold, Ruskin, Robert Louis Stevenson, Tolstoi, Henry David Thoreau, Ernest Renan, Du Maurier, Huxley, William Dean Howells, Rudyard Kipling, Bayard Taylor, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth B. Browning, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, Christina Rossetti, and J. M. Barrie. Other books included, Waiting on Destiny (Boston, 1889) a story for girls, and Lucille and Her Friends (Chicago, 1890). =Social reformer= Much of the work of her later years was in the field of practical philanthropy as well as literature. She was a delegate from Wisconsin to the National Conference of Charities in Saint Paul, Minnesota. She read papers that attracted attention in various Unitarian conferences and in State associations. Griswold led locally in the temperance cause for years. Since a child, her sympathies were active for the drunkard and his family, and her efforts unceasing for their help and cure. She served as president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and president of the Youths' Alliance, a child's organization for similar work, and for the personal temperance of its members. She supplemented these labors with many written articles. The subject of associated charities also engaged her attention. Personal life In 1863, in Columbus, she married Eugene Sherwood Griswold, a merchant, and they reared their three daughters here. Her home was a meeting place of many of the notable people of the day, for she had an extensive personal acquaintance with literary and other celebrities.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those that are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have up to twelve small, partly green, partly translucent flowers and lack a rosette.Labelled image of P. diminuta Description Pterostylis diminuta, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of between three and six, egg-shaped leaves, each leaf long and wide. Flowering plants lack a rosette but have up to twelve flowers on a flowering spike high with four to seven linear to lance-shaped stem leaves that are long and wide. The flowers are long, wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column. The galea is dark green with translucent \\"windows\\" and a brownish, tapered tip. The lateral sepals turn downwards and are long, wide and joined for about half their length. The labellum is long, about wide and brownish with a dark stripe along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming The small-flowered leafy greenhood was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Mark Clements and given the name Bunochilus diminutus. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected in the Deep Lead Reserve near Stawell. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Pterostylis diminuta. The specific epithet (diminuta) is from \\"the Latin diminutus, diminished, made small, in reference to the smaller flowers and floral parts of this species when compared with B. melagrammus\\" (Pterostylis melagramma). Distribution and habitat Pterostylis diminuta occurs in grassy or shrubby woodland and forest between Ballarat and the Grampians in Victoria.

She came to prominence in 2003 after finishing third in the first season of Ídolos, the Portuguese version of Idols television series. After going on hiatus to attend the Berklee College of Music, she released her debut album, The Cherry on My Cake, in 2011. She later composed \\"Amar pelos dois\\", which won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 for Portugal and was performed by her brother Salvador Sobral. Life and career =Early life and career= Luísa Sobral was born and raised in Lisbon, and also lived in the United States for a period of time as a child. Her younger brother is Salvador Sobral, who is also a singer. Through her father, she is related to Hermano José Braamcamp de Almeida Castelo Branco, a 19th-century Portuguese nobleman and politician of Italian and Dutch descent. In 2003, at the age of 16, Sobral auditioned for season one of Ídolos, the Portuguese version of Idols. She eventually came third in the competition. After Ídolos, Sobral took a break from her musical career in order to focus on her education. She moved to the United States to study music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, graduating in 2009. Her move to the United States made her compositions more distinct, a mixture between Portuguese, Brazilian, French and North American musical traditions, reflecting her musical influences in her classic soft- spoken singing style. =2011–present: Professional career= Luísa Sobral returned to the music industry in 2011, releasing her debut studio album, The Cherry on My Cake. The album peaked at No.3 on the Portuguese albums chart. In 2012, she performed with Jools Holland and Melody Gardot. She went on tour with Gardot. Her second studio album, There's a Flower in My Bedroom, was released in 2013, and her third, Lu-Pu-I-Pi-Sa-Pa, the following year. In 2016, Sobral released her fourth studio album, Luísa, recorded in Los Angeles at United Recording Studios with Joe Henry and Greg Leisz. During the same year, she wrote \\"Amar pelos dois\\" for Portuguese national broadcaster RTP1's Festival da Canção 2017. At the invitation of the broadcaster, wanting to change the public perspective in which Portugal had never gotten past sixth place, Luísa and Salvador Sobral represented musicians who were unknown outside of Portugal. Salvador Sobral, her younger brother, sang \\"Amar pelos dois\\", a bossa-nova-inspired jazz ballad that was written by Luísa Sobral. It clearly won Festival da Canção, and was thus chosen to represent Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Because Portugal is not included in the Big 5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom) that are able to reach the final without participating in the semi-finals, the song had to go through the semi-final stage before reaching the final. Luísa and Salvador Sobral learned that the song had risen to the top of betting agencies' polls, beating such as Francesco Gabbani's \\"Occidentali's Karma\\". During rehearsals for the contest in Kiev, Sobral had to stand in for Salvador as a performer due to his health issues. During the final on 13 May 2017, the song was declared the winner, becoming the first victory for Portugal and the record- holder for the most points received by a song in the final. Sobral performed the song with Salvador during his winner's encore performance, as she did after he won Festival da Canção 2017. The song and the winning performance in Kiev made Luísa and Salvador Sobral household names overnight in Portugal. They were received like heroes by hundreds of fans upon their arrival at Lisbon Airport. In 23 April 2018 Sobral and her brother were given the Portuguese Order of Merit, both receiving medals of Commanders (ComM). This award was given by Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Personal life Luisa Sobral announced her pregnancy in January 2016, although she did not reveal who the father of the child was. Her son, José, was born in 2016. In December 2017, she announced that she was pregnant with her second child. On 13 May 2018 she gave birth to a daughter, Rosa. In April 2020, she announced third pregnancy.

He composed it in Vienna in July 1827, setting words by Franz Grillparzer (\\"Zögernd leise, in des Dunkels nächt'ger Hülle\\"). Schubert wrote two versions, for male and female chorus, originally catalogued as: * D 920, for alto solo, TTBB chorus & piano * D 921, for alto solo, SSAA chorus & piano, Op. 135(p) The latest update of Deutsch's catalogue places both versions under D 920, and D 921 is no longer used. History The poem which Schubert set was specially commissioned from Franz Grillparzer by Anna Fröhlich, a singing teacher in Vienna, to celebrate the birthday (or name-day) of her pupil Louise Gosmar. Fröhlich showed Grillparzer's poem to Schubert and asked him to set it to music, who obliged within a few days with the version for mezzo-soprano and men's voices (D. 920 in Otto Deutsch's chronological catalogue). However, Fröhlich was unhappy because she wanted a setting for Gosmar to sing with her female friends. So Schubert swiftly produced a re- scored version with SSAA chorus, D. 921. The composer failed to turn up at the public performance and had to be fetched from a nearby beer-house. Schubert only set two other poems by Grillparzer: \\"Bertas Lied in der Nacht\\", D 653, and \\"Mirjams Siegesgesang\\", D 942. Manuscripts and publication The title may be Diabelli's own: the manuscript of D 920 is headed 'Chor mit Alt=Solo / Gedicht von Grillparzer'.

Trained as historian at Leiden University, he moved to Batavia (today's Jakarta) to take a government job, and later became a teacher for various schools in Indonesia. At the same time, he pursued his interest in the history of Indonesia and published books and articles on the topic. After a brief assignment at the University of Indonesia, he returned to the Netherlands. He taught at various institutions, including Leiden, until 1967 and continued to publish scholarly works, even after his retirement. He suffered a serious stroke in 1982 and died two years later. His works covered the history of Indonesia in general, with emphasis on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Java. His works extensively consulted both European and Indonesian sources, one of the first trained historians to do so. Historian M. C. Ricklefs called him the \\"father of the study of Javanese history\\", while Javanist Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud said his works formed \\"a substantial contribution to the study of the national history of Indonesia.\\"  Biography  = Early life = Batavia, Dutch East Indies c. 1920s, around the time of de Graaf's stay. De Graaf was born on 2 December 1899 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where he attended school. In 1919, he went to Leiden University to study history. The historian and orientalist Johan Huizinga was among his professors there. In 1926 he took up a government job in Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia). While he sailed to Batavia (today's Jakarta), he read about Indonesian history, sparking his interest for the first time. He was posted at Surabaya to become a history teacher in a Hogere Burgerschool (HBS, high school) for a year. Subsequently, he moved to Batavia, first to work at the city's museum library, and then at the Inspectorate of Middle Schools. While at Batavia he met the Javanese professor Poerbatjaraka, who then gave him weekly lessons in Javanese language and culture. He began to pursue his scholarly interest while still having the Inspectorate job. His first scholarly article was published in 1929. In the same year he married a teacher, Carolinia Johanna Mekkink. =Academic career in Indonesia= In 1931 de Graaf left government service and became a schoolmaster in Malang, and then Prabalingga. In 1935 he returned to Leiden to earn his doctorate. His supervisor was H. T. Colenbrander, whose work had initially sparked his interest in Indonesian history. His dissertation was on the murder of Captain François Tack in the Mataram court in 1686, In 1935, he returned to the Indies and resumed teaching in Surakarta. He took his Javanese students to visit historical sites and Islamic holy sites throughout Java, despite the school being a Protestant school. During school vacations he continued his research in Batavia, publishing articles on the Trunajaya rebellion and the fall of Mataram. He also wrote for the Chinese Geschiedenis in 1941. Fear about the work's unflattering description of the Japanese led its publisher to largely destroy it in 1942 as the Japanese took over the Indies as part of World War II. He was then interned and spent the war in several camps and befriended the linguist C. C. Berg. De Graaf's wife was interned separately in a women's camp, and in 1944 their nine-year-old daughter Elisabeth Anna died in captivity. World War II was followed by the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49) which pitted the newly independent Indonesia against the Dutch trying to regain its colony. He taught briefly in Bandung before Berg invited him to Jakarta to teach in what would become the University of Indonesia. He accepted the invitation and stayed in Jakarta until 1950. During this period he authored various works, including The Crown of Majapahit (Dutch: Over de kroon van Madja-Pait, 1948) and his famous A History of Indonesia (Dutch: Geschiedenis van Indonesië, 1949). He also made a research trip to the Netherlands in 1947–48, during which he worked through Dutch East India Company archives sent to him in Arnhem from The Hague. He also felt disillusionment with the direction of the young Republic of Indonesia and the leadership of Sukarno. This disillusionment, as well as his wife's safety concerns about teaching as a foreigner in Indonesia, and frustration over not being made a professor—he thought this was promised to him—led him to leave Indonesia for good in 1950. = Career in the Netherlands = De Graaf left for the Netherlands in 1950, and in 1953 he became a privaat docent at Leiden, teaching Indonesian history. His inaugural lecture there about the Babad Tanah Jawi triggered an academic dispute with C. C. Berg. In 1955, Berg said that de Graaf relied too naively on Javanese sources material, which led him to accept the historicity of Sutawijaya—founder of Mataram and Sultan Agung's grandfather, also known as Panembahan Senapati, while Berg believed that he was a myth created to enhance Agung's legitimacy, and that Agung was the real founder. De Graaf replied in a 1956 paper, in which he disproved—with support from European sources—Berg's thesis that Agung was Mataram's founder. However, not all issues were resolved, and the continuing debate soured de Graaf's relation with Berg on both academic and personal level. He continued to teach in various Dutch schools up to his retirement in 1967. These years were his most productive; he wrote four important volumes on Javanese history between 1500—1700: one on the court of Mataram as visited by Dutch envoys (published 1956), one on the reign of Sultan Agung (1958) and two volumes on the reign of Amangkurat I (1961 and 1962). = Retirement and death = In 1967 de Graaf retired from teaching but continued his scholarly pursuit. He regularly contributed to the magazine Tong Tong (later known as Moesson), writing about Indonesian history in a more casual style. He also published works on the Kediri campaign of 1678 in 1971, and two volumes on the 1807–08 journey of the ship De Vlieg in Brazil (published in 1975–56). Later, he met another Dutch scholar of Java Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud and, who became his friend and collaborator. In 1974, they published a history of early Muslim principalities in Java, covering a period with less certain historical sources. In 1976, Pigeaud published an English summary of eight of de Graaf's most important works, making them available to the non-Dutch-reading audience. During the same period, he also began to work on the history the Moluccas, especially on the Ambonese, whom de Graaf thought the Dutch owed a \\"duty of gratitude\\" for helping \\"enrich\\" the Dutch and spreading their authority around Indonesia. He published a comprehensive history of Ambon and South Moluccas in 1977. In May 1982 he attended the annual meeting of Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies and suffered a stroke on the way home. The stroke prevented him from working, and later from communicating, until he died on 24 August 1984.  Works  The island of Java in Indonesia. Its history is the main subject of de Graaf's work. De Graaf's doctoral dissertation, on the murder of Captain François Tack in the Mataram court in 1686, was \\"a landmark in the study of Javanese history\\", according to M. C. Ricklefs. While historians had studied the history of Java before him, his work combined both Javanese and European sources and made use of the historical method. His 1948 study The Crown of Majapahit corrected a misunderstanding among European historians of Java, who had previously thought that the golden crown that the Dutch acquired for Amangkurat II helped legitimize his rule. De Graaf argued that crowns and coronations did not carry the same significance in the Javanese royalty as it did for Europeans. Instead, the episode contributed to Amangkurat's hatred of the Dutch for their condescension and involvement in his rule. His 1949 History of Indonesia was the most authoritative textbook on Indonesian history up to the 1970s. Unlike previous books written by Europeans, it gave more emphasis on Indonesians (in addition to Europeans). During the 1950s and 1960s, among his other works, he wrote four important volumes on Javanese history between 1500—1700. The first one, published in 1956 was about the court of Mataram in 1648—54 as visited by Dutch envoys, and remains the most important source on that topic. The second one was about the reign of Sultan Agung (published 1958) and other two were about the reign of Amangkurat I (published 1961 and 1962). These volumes consulted European works, including English, Dutch, Portuguese and Danish sources, as well as Indonesian sources: Javanese and Madurese. Ricklefs praised these works, pointing out the diverse sources being used and de Graaf's ability to locate references, \\"however fleeting,\\" for this period. In 1971, he edited and published Johan Jurgen Briel's journal which provided accounts of the Kediri campaign of 1678. In 1974, he and Pigeaud published The First Islamic States of Java, which combined the methods of history and philology. This work became an authority on the spread of Islam in Java during the 15th and the 16th century, despite its lack of certainty given the unreliability of sources from that period. Because his works were mostly in Dutch, in 1976 Pigeaud published Islamic States in Java 1500–1700: Eight Dutch Books and Articles by Dr H.J. de Graaf, an English summary of what he considered de Graaf's eight most important works, including The First Islamic States of Java, works on the reigns of Sutawijaya, Sultan Agung, Amangkurat I and Amangkurat II, including various phases of the Trunajaya rebellion. The book also provided a bibliography and index to the original works.  Recognitions  In 1974, de Graaf was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies. Many later scholars of Javanese history consider themselves his heirs, and historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs called him the \\"father of the study of Javanese history\\". According to Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud, his works \\"form a substantial contribution to the study of the national history of Indonesia.\\"  Personal life  He was married in 1929 to Carolina Johanna Mekkink. They had four children: Hendrik (b. 1931), Johannes (b. 1933), Elisabeth Anna (b. 1935) and Anna Elisabeth (b. 1948). Elisabeth Anna died in 1944 in a Japanese World War II internment camp. He was a devout Protestant and held conservative political views, which sometimes put him at odds with his Dutch academic colleagues.

The seal contains a number of scenes of Springfield's historic buildings. In its crest is a picture of the Springfield Armory's arsenal building with the American flag, the only recognizable landmark of the seal extant today. Below this crest sits a shield with an embellished trim and an arrow running through it from east to west. From the top, clockwise, the first scene shows a train leaving the city's first Union Station, crossing the former North End Bridge over the Connecticut River; the house on the lower right is the \\"Old Fort\\", the residence of John Pychon, built on the homestead of his father William Pynchon. Erected in 1660, it was the first brick building in the settlement, and served as a safehouse during the siege on Springfield during King Philip's War, and remained on the corner of what is now Fort Street, presently the Student Prince/Fort Restaurant, until 1831 when it was razed for new construction. The scene on the lower left shows three smaller buildings and two steamboats on river; prior to the construction of Interstate 91, the Connecticut River played a more significant role in the livelihood of the city.Verel, Amy C.

Biography Thaqabah was the son of Rumaythah ibn Abi Numayy, Emir of Mecca. In 744 AH (1343/1344) Thaqabah and his brother Ajlan purchased the Emirate of Mecca from their father for 60,000 dirhams. Soon afterwards, Thaqabah went to Egypt in response to summons from Sultan al-Salih Isma'il while Ajlan remained in Mecca. In Dhu al-Qi'dah 744 AH (March/April 1344) news reached Mecca that al- Salih had arrested Thaqabah and returned the Emirate to Rumaythah. Thaqabah was later released and returned to Mecca. In 746 AH (1345) Ajlan became Emir of Mecca and expelled Thaqabah to Wadi Nakhlah. Later that year Thaqabah was arrested in Egypt with his brothers Sanad and Mughamis. In 747 AH (1346/1347) or 748 AH (1347/1348) Sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban released Thaqabah, Sanad, and Mughamis and appointed them co-rulers with Ajlan. In 750 AH Thaqabah ousted Ajlan from the Emirate. On 5 Shawwal 750 AH () Ajlan retook the Emirate from his brothers and Thaqabah traveled to Yemen. In 752 AH (1351) Thaqabah established himself at al-Jadid in opposition to his brother in Mecca. That year the Sultan summoned them both to Egypt; they traveled separately but Ajlan turned back at Yanbu. Thaqabah reached Cairo and was appointed Emir of Mecca in place of his brother. He returned to Mecca in Dhu al-Qi'dah 752 AH (December 1351 / January 1352) with 50 mamluks but Ajlan prevented him from entering the city. Thaqabah waited at Khulays until the Hajj arrived. After mediation by the Egyptian amir al-rakab, Ajlan agreed to share the Emirate with Thaqabah. In 753 AH (1352) Thaqabah deposed Ajlan. He reigned until Dhu al-Hijjah 754 AH (January 1353) when the Egyptian amir al-rakab Umar Shah arrested him and installed Ajlan to the Emirate. Thaqabah was imprisoned in Egypt until 756 AH (1355), when the amir al-'arab Fayyad ibn Muhanna interceded for him. In Muharram 757 AH (January 1356) Ajlan and Thaqabah reconciled and divided the Emirate between them. On 13 Jumada al-Akhir () Thaqabah deposed Ajlan, but when the Hajj arrived (November 1356) Ajlan reentered Mecca and Thaqabah fled to Yemen. In Dhu al-Hijjah 758 AH (November 1357) the brothers again reconciled and agreed to rule in partnership. In Jumada al-Awwal 760 AH (April 1359) Sultan al-Nasir Hasan summoned them both to appear before him but they did not do so. The following month they received word that al-Nasir had deposed them and appointed in their place their brother Sanad and their cousin Muhammad ibn Utayfah. Ajlan proposed to Thaqabah that they each give 400 camels to secure the allegiance of the Banu Hasan and preserve their rule. Thaqabah rejected Ajlan's proposal, and Ibn Utayfah assumed the Emirate when he arrived with Egyptian forces in late Jumada al- Akhir (May 1359). After the Hajj of 761 AH (October/November 1359) Ibn Utayfah departed with the Egyptian army, and Thaqabah took his place as co-ruler with Sanad. In 762 AH Ajlan was released from prison and appointed Emir of Mecca alongside Thaqabah. He arrived in Ramadan and met Thaqabah at Wadi Marr, but Thaqabah was ill and died there, either in Ramadan or early Shawwal (July/August 1361). He was buried in the Ma'lah cemetery, near his father Rumaythah. Issue Thaqabah had four sons: Ahmad, Hasan, Ali, and Mubarak. He also had a daughter, Fatimah.

It is essentially an elongated arming sword or the later period messer, possibly a descendant of the longsword. Though scant when it comes to both literary and iconographic references, the Faussart was possibly used by both cavalry and infantry. It is usually illustrated wielded by cavalry, usually of the knightly class, indicating it as a high-end weapon in contemporary sources. Image taken from the Morgan Bible (Folio 10 Verso - top). The Faussart is in the forefront slicing into a mounted soldier.  Origins  The weapon probably relates to the agricultural tool for grass cutting, the Scythe The Maciejowski Bible (Morgan Bible) depicts an example of a two-handed Faussart used by a mounted knight.  Features  The Faussart had a straight, one-sided sharpened pointed blade, that was both slender and long. It carried a long handle for a two handed grip, which allowed a powerful blow from horseback. It also seems to have been light enough for one-hand handling, but could also be carried with two hands, so that it could be hefted with more strength, which was equally appropriate for mounted users and foot soldiers. The Warbrand in the Maciejowski Bible is shown without a guard, but it does not need it as a pure weapon.  General  There are no extant examples in existence of the Faussart, and no written descriptions of it, or manuals covering techniques for its use. The English term \\"Warbrand\\", used for this weapon is an erroneous modern fictional term invented by companies that sell modern reproductions. Warbrand simply meaning \\"War Sword\\".  Evolution/Development  The Faussart seems to have developed into the two handed long sword, or was made redundant by it, as there is no evidence that it continued to be used into the Late Medieval era when the longsword became commonplace.

History and design The Model 25 armoured car was a British designed and manufactured military vehicle, which the British Army used in India. The Model 25 was also exported. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) saw a need for increased mechanization, and the Kwantung Army began to import foreign-built vehicles, including the Model 25. The Kwantung Army used them during the Mukden Incident (Manchurian Incident), which was a staged event engineered by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for the Japanese invasion in 1931 of northeastern China, known as Manchuria. The Manchukuo Imperial Army that was established by Imperial Japan in Manchuria, later received some Model 25s for use. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) also imported the Model 25 during the early 1930s for use in China. The Model 25 was used specially by the Special Naval Landing Forces during the hostilities between Japanese military and the Chinese 19th Route Army in what became known as the January 28 Incident or Shanghai Incident in 1932. The armoured cars were imported to strengthen the Japanese forces in and around the urban city and port area. The Argentine Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers received 6 Vickers-Crossley Model 26 armoured cars in 1928. Derived from the British Indian Army cars, they had 2 axles instead of 3. They saw action during the 1930 Argentine coup d'état and some are later used by the Argentine Federal Police. The vehicle used riveted and welded armor with a thickness of 6 mm. It had a hemispherical turret, which mounted twin 7.7 mm water-cooled Vickers machine guns with a domed cupola.

Ebola can cause disease in humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).\\" Ebola was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in the DRC. More than 11,300 people died in the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. According to the WHO's \\"Global Health Observatory\\", the DRC's population in 2015 was 77,267,000. On 1 July 2017, DRC Minister of Public Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, declared that the country had passed a 42-day period with no new recorded cases, and therefore the outbreak was over. A subsequent outbreak of Ebola was declared by WHO on 8 May 2018, in the northwest Province of Équateur. Epidemiology The first \\"situation report\\" from the WHO on 15 May 2017 listed 19 suspected cases and 3 deaths. The first person to request treatment was a 39-year-old male. On 16 May, the WHO indicated that there had been 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths. Approximately 400 additional individuals were being monitored in the same region of the DRC. On 17 May, WHO said that the number of individuals being monitored had risen to about 416, while the following day, the number of confirmed and suspected cases had risen to 29. As of 24 May, 520 individuals were reported to be on the contact list to monitor their health status. Of those, 226 had completed 21 days of monitoring. As of 27 May, 30 cases had been reclassified as not Ebola-related. Responses =Organizations= On 13 May 2017, Doctors Without Borders indicated that they would send a team to the most recently affected area in the DRC. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, indicated that 300,000 doses of the experimental Ebola vaccine were available if needed. On 28 May, it was reported that the DRC had authorized use of the vaccine. =Nearby countries= As of 8 June 2017, the WHO does not recommend any restrictions of travel and trade in relation to this outbreak. The following nine countries have instituted entry screening at airports and ports of entry: Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Rwanda has issued travel advisories to avoid unnecessary travel to the DRC. Kenya and Rwanda have implemented information checking on arrival for passengers with a travel history from or through the DRC. According to the WHO, countries have the right to implement these measures. On 20 May, the news media reported Rwanda's closure of its border with the DRC for passengers coming from affected areas in the DRC. On 23 May, the WHO confirmed that Rwanda is denying entry to visitors with fever who have been to those areas. Under Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005), the WHO considers these actions to be \\"additional health measures ... that significantly interfere with international traffic\\". As of 8 June the WHO is attempting to obtain and review Rwanda's public health rationale and relevant scientific information for implementing these measures. Virology Ebola virus - electron micrograph The sub-type Zaire ebolavirus has been confirmed in the current outbreak, from the family Filoviridae.

There are few protections from mutilation and non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and no legislative protection from discrimination. Intersex persons may have difficulties in obtaining birth certificates and others forms of documentation. History Traditionally, children who are identified as having an intersex condition at birth were killed. This is beginning to change, according to midwives and birth attendants' organizations. Surviving intersex children may have difficulties in obtaining birth certificates and other forms of identification. In December 2017, African intersex activists published a statement setting out local demands. In August 2018, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights published a report calling for research and legal reform to protect the rights of intersex persons in Kenya.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy  thumbright260px Reports suggest that the birth of an intersex infant can be regarded as a curse or bad omen, resulting in infanticide. Seline Okiki, chairperson of the organization of birth attendants, Ten Beloved Sisters, has described how babies born intersex are traditionally killed following birth. In 2015, it was reported that an intersex adolescent from Malindi, Muhadh Ishmael, was mutilated and later died in hospital. He had previously been described as a curse on his family. In October 2018, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported that some intersex people have been forced to undergo genital surgeries and, in \\"some cases the procedures were botched resulting in death\\". In the same year, two major national reports were published on the situation of intersex people in Kenya: a report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, and a report of a Taskforce on Policy, Legal, Institutional and Administrative Reforms regarding Intersex Persons in Kenya. Both reports called for reform to protect the bodily integrity of intersex persons, and action to tackle stigma. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights called for the convening of an intersex health working group, establishing national guidelines for medical practices, and multi-disciplinary teams, and direct doctors to \\"advise all parents to withhold “normalizing” surgery until children are at an age when they can make a decision for themselves\\", investigate infanticide and child abuse, research the impact of intersex medical interventions, and fund access to consented medical treatment. The Taskforce stated that \\"Surgical and hormonal interventions for children in relation to their intersex status should only be carried out in case of medical emergency based on informed consent\\". It recommended that the government provide: * \\"protection against involuntary and inappropriate medical intervention and ensure effective remedy\\" * develop guidelines, and promote access to healthcare, including through a treatment fund and prenatal counselling. Protection from discrimination thumbright260px Intersex people are considered to suffer significant stigma. A Kenyan news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school \\"because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers\\". Anecdotal reports point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people. In the 2010 case of Richard Muasya v. the Hon. Attorney General, Muasya had been convicted of robbery with violence. The case examined whether or not he had suffered discrimination as a result of being born intersex. He was found to have been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment while in prison. Intersex people in Kenya do not currently have protections from discrimination, but the rights of intersex people are currently a matter of discussion, including through a Taskforce led by nominated MP Isaac Mwaura. In part, this followed a landmark court case decided in 2014, of a child who could not commence school without a birth certificate. A 2018 report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights found evidence of widespread stigma and discrimination, including infanticide, lack of birth registration, and high rates of early school leaving. It found that intersex people suffered from myths that intersex people are the products of a \\"curse\\", and that intersex people are gay or transgender, and that these myths impaired their right to a fair trial. It called for legal reform to * Enact a legal definition of intersex that is broader and that recognizes the diversity of intersex variations * Educate the public * \\"Amend and enact legislation that gives effect to the provisions of Article 27(4) of the Constitution so as to guarantee non-discrimination to inter sex persons in all spheres of life, including in: education, health care, employment, sports and access to public services, and address such discrimination through relevant anti-discrimination initiatives\\" The Taskforce recommended that the government: * \\"ensure equal treatment, respect and protection of the dignity of intersex persons within the criminal justice sector.\\" Identification documents In 2014, in the case of Baby ‘A’ (Suing through her Mother E.A) & another v Attorney General & 6 others [2014], a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia. In Kenya a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting. The child's lawyer, John Chigiti, stated that this was a \\"first step toward recognizing intersex people\\". In an earlier, 2010, High Court case, Richard Muasya v. the Hon. Attorney General, the Court had determined that an intersex person was responsible for registering his own birth, following a failure to do so at the time of his birth. The report of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights stated that children should not be assigned to a third sex category but that the government should \\"implement the approach advocated by intersex groups known as the “non-surgical best guess approach”\\" and \\"allow intersex persons to change their legal name and gender on all of their identity documents.\\" The Taskforce proposed creation of a third sex category for intersex people, \\"to facilitate recognition of intersex persons in the law\\". Sport In May 2019, news organizations reported that two women athletes were dropped from the national athletics team, following the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the case of Caster Semenya.

The park is triangular in shape, bounded by Scott, Front and Wellington streets. The park is bordered at its eastern tip, where Wellington and Front join, by the Gooderham Building, a heritage building that is an example of a \\"flatiron building\\". A widely admired mural graces the western facade of the building. The park is named after William Berczy, an architect and surveyor, who worked with John Graves Simcoe, the first Governor of Upper Canada, in founding its capital, York, Upper Canada, the town that grew into Toronto. History Prior to the 2015 renovation the park's central courtyard was surrounded by benches that faced its fountain. The park was opened in 1980, replacing a parking lot. Prior to the 1950s the site was occupied by office building behind both the Gooderham and Coffin Block.https://www.blogto.com/city/2011/01/nostalgia_tripping_the_flatiron_building/ The park was closed in September 2015 for renovation. A key focal point of the renovated park was the replacement of the park's original fountain, with a larger two-tier fountain that incorporated sculptures. The park was redesigned by landscape architect Claude Cormier of Montreal, who also designed Toronto's Sugar Beach. The renovations cost $7.2 million. The renovation was the first since the park opened. Among the required work was the removal of several large trees that had outgrown the soil reservoir provided for them. Fifty new trees were planted in Silva Cell growing chambers, each tree having of soil provided for its roots to grow. The park officially reopened on June 28, 2017. Features The distinctive feature of the park is a large, two-tier fountain with cast-iron statues of 27 dogs and a cat. The dogs are all looking up towards a large bone perched on the fountain's peak. The cat is looking north at statues of two small birds perched on the arm of a lamp post about 3 metres away from the fountain. The fountain also includes a ground level trough to provide drinking water for real dogs. Each of the dog statues contributes to the fountain function by each sprouting water upwards from their mouths. There is also a second cat statue perched on an electrical box at the south-west corner of the park. At the east end of the park, there is an irrigated pea gravel patch, intended for dog owners to allow their pets to do their business. The landscaping includes grassy berms and garden beds. A children's play area is planned for the northwest corner of the park. Scott Street, on the west side of the park, features curbless borders and pavers to integrate the street into the park design. The City's Economic Development and Culture Division has commissioned a public artwork titled Jacob's Ladder by Toronto artist Luis Jacob. It will be installed in late 2017 on the west side of the park.

He participated to the Transatlantic flight organized by Italo Balbo and awarded with the Gold Medal of Aeronautic Valor to aeronautic valor of Regia Aeronautica. He was born in Torremaggiore, a small town in the south of Italy, on October 9, 1900 to a wealthy landowning family. He had a passion for flying since he was a child. As a young adult he decided to not follow his families wishes and rather his own passion. He started his career by enrolling in the military for officials of Regia Marina. He attained his pilot's license in Scuola di Pilotaggio di 2° Periodo in Foggia Sud airport (nowadays Gino Lisa airport) After his degree of captain of lingo corso, he was nominated guardiamarina in 1921; after three years he took place in Regia Aeronautica and lately in 184th Squadriglia Idrovolanti where in 1925 attained the seaplanes pilot's license for Savoia- Marchetti S.59 and S.59bis airplanes. He was selected and inserted into the group of aviator that took the 1928 Crociera del Mediterraneo Occidentale (Orbetello - Los Alcázares) with a Savoia-Marchetti S.59bis.  High speed aviator  uniform emblem From 1930 to 1932 he took service at Reparto Alta Velocità ( high speed unit) of Desenzano del Garda. He was admitted to the II Course for high speed seaplanes piloting the Macchi-Castoldi MC-72. As part of Velocisti (High speed runners) he was allowed to wear a special emblem with a red V in the middle of an eagle on his uniform.  Crociera del decennale: the first massed flight of aircraft ever to cross the Atlantic.  The route from Rome to Chicago in 1933 In 1933 Lippi was selected again by Italo Balbo to take part of epic Crociera del Decennale known by Americans as Italian Air Armada, this was the first massed flight of aircraft ever to cross the Atlantic. From 1 July to 12 August 1933, a flight of twenty-four seaplanes on a round-trip flight from Rome to the Century of Progress in Chicago, Illinois. The flight had eight legs; Orbetello — Amsterdam — Derry — Reykjavík — Cartwright, Labrador — Shediac — Montreal ending on Lake Michigan near Burnham Park and New York City. In honor of this feat, Mussolini donated a column from Ostia to the city of Chicago: the Balbo Monument; it can still be seen along the Lakefront Trail, a little south of Soldier Field. Chicago administration renamed the former 7th Street in Balbo Drive and staged a great parade in his honor. The Newfoundland Post Office overprinted a 75-cent airmail stamps, that has just been issued a few weeks previously, for the event. From Chicago they flew to New York City with an escort of 36 U.S. airplanes. New York population gave an incredible crowded and warm welcomes the pilots on Broadway (Manhattan). Millions of people acclaimed the big parade of dozens cars escorted by police horses throughout the streets on Manhattan. His plane (Savoia-Marchetti S.55X) during the aircruise was marked as \\"I-LIPP\\" under the wings and on tail. For that reason Antonio was honored with the Medaglia d'Oro to Aeronautic Valor and with a promotion to Maggiore rank.  Career and family  He took part of the famous group of high speed aviators called \\"Sorci Verdi\\" and in 1937 raced the flight competition Istres–Damascus–Paris Air Race. His Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 (Competizione Sportiva version) was marked as I-LICA. In the Damascus point he had an accident during the takeoff: hit a hole in the semi prepared strip and destroyed his undercarriage and could not continue. Despite everything he managed to maintain the control of the airplane. For that occasion was awarded with Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare. His team won the competition reaching the first, second and third position. His pilot skills brought him to Stormo Aerosiluranti, the main Regia Aeronautica flight storm. In 1940 he married Amalia Stingone with whom had three sons: (1941) Nicola, (1943) Alfonso (1946) Lorenzo and settled his home in Rome. In 1943 he became Capo di Stato Maggiore nel Comando SAS and in 1944 in chief of comando raggruppamento bombardieri e trasporti.  After World War II  After the World War II was integrated into the new Air force of the new Repubblica Italiana : Aeronautica Militare. In 1947 he took command of Direzione Generale Armi e Munizioni and became the Inspector General of the Air Force. For his human grace and his aviator skills he was honored with Generale di Divisione Aerea. He died in Palermo on February 2, 1957 and was proclaimed official day of mourning.  Legacy  In Torremaggiore there is a street entitled in his honor: Via Generale Lippi. At Museo storico dell'Aeronautica in Bracciano there is a section focused on the Crociera del Decennale where are conserved some historical photos and models. You can order a model of the Savoia-Marchetti S.55X with the I-LIPP mark on it. On April 29, 2017 was celebrated 60th years from his death with a personal exhibition at Museo Civico di Torremaggiore with models of seaplanes, historical photos, antiquities.

An area of disturbed weather developed southwest of Pohnpei on August 6, 1987. The system initially remained disorganized, but by August 14, Cary had attained tropical storm intensity. After initially moving north-northwest, Cary turned west-northwest, although intensification was slow to occur. On August 15, Cary was upgraded into a typhoon, and on August 17, the typhoon peaked in intensity. Typhoon Cary then made landfall in northern Luzon while at peak intensity. Across the Philippines, 954 houses were damaged and an additional 89 were destroyed, which left 55,567 people, or 13,247 families that were either homeless or otherwise sought shelter. Five people died in the country while damage totaled $5.58 million (1987 USD), including $1.45 million from agriculture and $4.13 million from infrastructure. The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified into a typhoon over the South China Sea. On August 21, Typhoon Cary passed just south of Hainan, where hundreds of homes were damaged but no fatalities occurred, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Tonkin. The storm weakened as it approached Vietnam, and on August 23, the storm dissipated inland over Laos. Across Vietnam, almost of land were flooded or destroyed. Twenty people were killed and many others were injured. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Cary can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that first developed within the monsoon trough on August 6 about southwest of Pohnpei, which is located in the eastern Caroline Islands. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system. On August 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit. Over the ensuing four days, the storm's circulation remained broad and its convection was poorly organized. On August 12, upper-level outflow improved in all four quadrants, which resulted in the JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). At 23:02 UTC, Hurricane Hunters measured flight level winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Based on this and satellite intensity estimates of , the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Cary while the storm was located around east-southeast of Manila. However, post-season analysis by the JTWC revealed that this occurred at 12:00 UTC on August 12. Following behind Typhoon Betty, Cary initially moved north-northwest, only to turn west- northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the storm's north. Initially, Betty's outflow inhibited development, but conditions aloft became more favorable once Betty weakened and passed over the Philippines. Dvorak intensity estimates suggested that the typhoon began to rapidly intensify. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft fix around midday on August 14 revealed that the storm was actually weakening and its center was becoming difficult to locate. Despite these developments, the JMA upgraded Cary into a tropical storm at noon that day. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started tracking the storm and assigned it with the name Ising. Early on August 15, the JTWC reported that Cary attained typhoon intensity, while the JMA upgraded Cary into a severe tropical storm. The final Western Pacific Hurricane Hunter mission – associated with the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron – was flown through Cary later that day, reporting winds of and a barometric pressure of . This was significantly lower than the Dvorak-based operational estimate from the JTWC. At around 12:00 UTC on August 16, the JMA classified Cary as a typhoon. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye appeared on satellite imagery. At 06:00 UTC on August 17, the JTWC also estimated Carry reached its peak intensity, with winds of . Six hours later, the JMA estimated that Cary attained winds of , its peak intensity. Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, Typhoon Carry turned slightly south of west and made landfall on eastern Luzon. Cary weakened steadily over land, and both the JMA and JTWC estimated that Cary weakened below typhoon intensity. After entering the South China Sea, however, Cary turned west and began to re-intensify. On the morning of August 19, the JMA re-upgraded Cary into a typhoon, with the JTWC following suit 36 hours later. At 18:00 UTC on August 21, Cary passed less than south of Hainan as a minimal typhoon. Accelerating towards the west, Typhoon Cary emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making landfall at noon on August 12 in northern Vietnam. At the time of landfall, the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of and respectively. the JTWC stopped tracking the system immediately after landfall, but the JMA continued to follow the system through the day of August 23 as the cyclone moved into northern Laos. The remnants of Cary eventually tracked into Burma before losing its identity. Preparations and impact =Philippines= Typhoon Cary threatened the Philippines less than a week after the country was devastated by Typhoon Betty. To avoid a repeat of Betty, much of northern Luzon was placed under a typhoon alert. Storm warnings were issued for the metropolitan area of Manila. Philippine Airlines canceled flights between Manila and three cities in northern Luzon. Schools were closed in several provinces over the northern portion of Luzon. Near where the typhoon moved ashore, in Dagupan City, authorities shut off water and electricity. A total of 1,800 people were evacuated in the resort town of Baguio, which is located north of Manila, due to landslides. The typhoon leveled a banana plantation in the Pangasinan province and caused floods that damaged two bridges in Ilocos and Cagayan provinces. Across the capital city of Manila, heavy rains led to street flooding. Nationwide, 954 homes were damaged and an additional 89 were destroyed, which resulted in 55,567 people or 13,247 families that either south shelter or were homeless. Five people were killed in the country. The storm inflicted $5.58 million in damage to the country, including $1.45 million from agriculture and $4.13 million from infrastructure. =Elsewhere= The typhoon passed close to Hainan Island on August 21, where hurricane-force winds and torrential rain resulted in the disruption of water and electrical services. Hundreds of houses were damaged and more than of crops were destroyed, but no deaths on the island occurred. After passing Hainan Island, the storm passed close enough to prompt a No 1. hurricane signal for Hong Kong, but this warning was dropped on August 20 as the storm receded. In all, the storm brought isolated showers to the area, with rainfall peaking at at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory. A peak wind gust of was measured in Tai Mo Shan. Throughout the vicinity of Hong Kong, no deaths or damage were reported. Cary struck Vietnam six days after Betty, resulting in additional flooding rains across the area. Throughout the coastal provinces of Thanh Hoa, Ha Nam Ninh, Thai Binh and Haiphong, floodwaters from the storm overflowed dikes. Furthermore, storm surge and heavy rains damaged of rice fields and more than of other cultivated land in Nghe Tinh. There, the storm damaged many houses, warehouses, schools, and medical facilities. Further south, of rice fields were inundated in Binh Tri Tien. Overall, 20 people were killed in the country and several others were injured.

It was designed by the noted local firm of Walker and Weeks for the W. Bingham Company, and is one of the architectural firm's few utilitarian commercial buildings. For many years, W. Bingham Co. was the Midwest's largest hardware manufacturer and wholesaler. The W. Bingham Co. went out of business in 1961, and the warehouse was sold to a succession of owners of the years. The warehouse was sold to private investors in 2001, who converted it into apartments, known today as The Bingham. About the building =Construction= Cleveland entrepreneurs William Bingham and Henry C. Blossom purchased the Clark & Murfey hardware store in 1841, and incorporated it as the W. Bingham Co. in 1888. In April 1913, the W. Bingham Co. announced it would construct a new building in the city's Warehouse District as its new headquarters. Intended to be the largest warehouse in Cleveland, the cost of the building and land were estimated at $1 million ($ in dollars). At the time of the announcement, the company had already completed the purchase of the land at a cost of about $400,000 ($ in dollars), and its architect, the noted Cleveland firm of Walker & Weeks, had finished preliminary designs for the building. The architects drew heavily on Knox & Elliott's 1905 Rockefeller Building as well as their own 1912 Renkert Building for inspiration, The warehouse, which was anticipated to be of steel and concrete construction, was designed to have a spur from the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (the \\"Big Four\\") run into its basement. The architects hoped to have as many as 17 truck loading docks on the building's northwest side, with a truck parking garage in one of the three basements. Another basement would be used for the storage of the heaviest goods. Elevators were intended to be located in the center of the building, so they could be reached quickly and efficiently by all points on each floor. At some point in 1913 or 1914, Christian, Schwarzenberg & Gaede, a local structural engineering firm, was hired to assist with the plans. By June 1914, work on the architectural plans had advanced to the point where W. Bingham Co. was ready to place an order for up to of structural steel and rebar. But city officials had extensive concerns about the architectural design, and extensive (if unreported) changes to the plans were under way in July 1914. At the end of July, W. Bingham Co. awarded the contract for the general contractor's job to the Cleveland construction firm Crowell-Lundoff-Little. Although the city was still withholding final approval for the architectural plans and building permit, enough of the design had won approval for the contractor to advise steel companies that it was interested in purchasing about of shaped steel. Although the design controversy continued, the McClintic-Marshall Corp. received the contract for of shaped steel in early August 1914, the Ayer & Lord Tie Co. of Chicago won the contract for of flooring and Carnegie Steel received the contract for of rebar in reinforcing bars in late August. Final approval of the architectural plans must have been close by the beginning of August 1914, because excavation at the site began. Plans now showed 10 above- ground floors (each of reinforced concrete) and three basement levels. At a total estimated cost of land and construction at $1 million ($ in dollars), it was reportedly the largest warehouse in the United States. The Fred R. Jones Company did the excavation work. The work was extremely difficult. The excavation site was , a large existing building abutted the southwest side of the site, and there was a very steep change in grade from the northeast to southwest. A steam shovel was used to remove the of earth, and steel sheet pilings were rammed into the soil to prevent cave-ins along the sides. These pilings were left in place to support the combined slab and pier foundation and freestanding retaining wall. Both the Big Four and the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the \\"Nickel Plate\\") ran a joint spur onto the site, then hauled the earth several miles to Kingsbury Run (where it was used as landfill). Excavation was complete in mid-October. The city issued a permit for construction of the foundation about the time the excavation was complete. The foundation used a combination of piers, slab, footings, and retaining walls. The total cost of the foundation was originally estimated to be about $50,000 ($ in dollars). Soil tests revealed a hard bluish clay about below the surface, and the piers rested on this clay. Cantilevered retaining walls with buttresses were built to hold back the surrounding earth, and two-way reinforced spread footings poured to support the walls. The William Edwards Co. building on the southwest side of the new warehouse left insufficient space for regular footings and a buttressed retaining wall to be used. Instead, Lackawanna sheet pilings were used to reinforce the wall, and two separate footings were built. As construction of the foundation proceeded, numerous pockets of quicksand were found in the soil. Further investigation revealed that pockets of quicksand lay beneath almost all the footings on the building's northeast side. A test pit was dug, and soil engineers discovered a solid clay further down. Light sheet pilings were used to create caissons. These were excavated, and the footings carried down to the firm clay. The city issued a building permit in late February or early March 1915. Work on the basement floors and walls proceeded very slowly. Enormous coal and ash bins and long steel rails for the moving of heavy items were designed to hang from ceiling beams in these areas. This required the use of shaped steel pieces which had to be perfectly joined, and the pouring of concrete around them. Once the basements were complete, the rest of the building rose very swiftly. Upper floors were poured at a rate of three floors a day, and the exterior brick walls rose at the rate of one floor every two days. The W. Bingham Co. warehouse opened for business in February or March 1916. About the building The W. Bingham Co. warehouse building cost $600,000 ($ in dollars). It is largely constructed of brick, concrete, and steel. The slightly L-shaped building was wide on W. 9th Street and wide on W. 10th Street and had a total length of ( between the basement walls). On W. 9th Street, eight floors were visible and the building height was . On W. 10th Street, 11 floors were visible and the building height was . Each floor had of space, for a total building interior space of . As viewed from W. 9th Street, the building had three basements. The rear (or southwest) wall of the third basement was actually a heavily reinforced slab and pier retaining wall high, giving the third basement a ceiling high. The third basement extended about under W. 9th Street, while the second and first basements only extended about under the street. There were originally only two large shipping doors, each roughly wide and high, in the rear wall of the third basement. To accommodate the doors, two exterior columns had to be omitted. In their place are two massive girders, each long and resting on a single massive pier between the doors. A railroad spur ran under the building's ell (along the line of the old Mandrake Avenue), and there were 24 truck loading docks on the structure's northwest side. The superstructure of the building featured unusually heavy columns and floor slabs designed to permit on the floors of the first and second basement and the first and second floor, and on floors three and higher. In order to accommodate the weight of the boiler, coal bin, ash bin, and associated equipment at the rear of the second basement, a portion of this floor was designed to withstand . The octagonal, steel core-and-concrete columns in this area were tall, extending from the foundation up to the second floor. Four of the exterior wall columns as well as all interior columns in the three basements and first floor were also steel core-and-concrete, to support the stresses on the structure below-ground. Above the second floor, all columns were reinforced concrete. The bases of all the columns consisted of cast iron- and-two-way reinforced concrete. All column caps were reinforced with shelf angles attached to the flanges and core reinforcement plates, and all columns were topped with octagonal plates reinforced with stiffeners. Above the second floor, all column tops were flared to help support the floor slab above. Due to complications created by the William Edwards building next to it, there were fewer exterior and interior columns in the structure's southwest corner. Instead, cantilevers supported the exterior walls above the third floor. The floors of the basements and upper floors were poured in slabs. These slabs were thick in the basements and on the first floor, and thick on all other floors. The roof was a slab. Spandrel beams were not used in the flooring system. The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted to do away with column caps in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels in the fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support. Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a creosote-impregnated wood block. The exterior of the building was clad in paving brick rejects. Walker & Weeks had used uniformly-colored paving brick on the Renkert Building, which it had designed shortly before beginning work on the W. Bingham Co. warehouse. Architect Harry Weeks recommended paving brick for the Bingham building because it was strong, long-wearing, and inexpensive. \\"Seconds\\" (bricks which were not uniform in color due to chemical differences, miscasting, or after spending too much time curing in the kiln) were recommended by Weeks because they created an aesthetically pleasing \\"tapestry effect which might be assumed to have resulted from careful artistic design, rather than accident and economy.\\" Windows in the building all had steel sashes and wire mesh glass. The roofline was a simple concave cavetto cornice. The interior of the building, as befit a warehouse, was relatively spartan. Five elevators were grouped in the center of the structure, and a pneumatic tube network installed in the shafts as a space-saving measure. The building also featured several spiral package chutes, and an exterior surface parking lot. The cost of the land and completed building was $1 million ($ in dollars). All told, of cast iron, of structural steel, of rebar, and of concrete were used in its construction. When completed, it was reportedly the largest single-unit warehouse in the world. =Architectural assessment= The W. Bingham Co. warehouse building is widely considered one of the finest Commercial style buildings in Cleveland. It features extremely high-quality construction and design, which is unusual for a utilitarian building. It is also, according to the Ohio Historic Places Dictionary, an early example of \\"vertical rectangular construction of a building in a manner clearly appropriate to its function.\\" The structure is widely celebrated for the inspired use of paving brick seconds, which adds color and texture to the building. The exterior is considered unusually sophisticated, with \\"subtle refinements of proportion and detail\\". It has also won praise for the simple, repetitive piers that bring it to life. History of the building With the completion of the warehouse, the W. Bingham Co. shifted from retail to wholesale-only operations. Over the years, changes to the interior reduced the available space to just . W. Bingham Co. ceased operations in June 1961. Several executives with the company purchased the corporate indicia, inventory, and equipment and formed a new company, Bingham, Inc. The new firm continued to sell Bingham products to manufacturing, mining, and railroad customers. W. Bingham Co. continued to own the warehouse, and leased space in it to various kinds of firms (including Bingham Inc.) Some time on or before 1971, the Bingham building was purchased by the Ostendorf-Morris Co., a local real estate investment company. In November 1973, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Having been purchased by outside investors in 1970 and by Formweld Products Co. in 1973, Bingham Co. moved out of the building in 1980. During the W. Bingham Co. warehouse's first half century, Cleveland and the Warehouse District went into significant decline. The rapid and significant expansion in heavy industry in Cleveland ended about 1930, and contracted dramatically after 1950. As the century neared its close, only chemical, instrument and medical equipment, and plastics manufacturing remained as major employers. The city's population reached a high of 914,808 in 1950, but dropped to under 400,000 at the turn of the century (and continued to decline). In the Warehouse District, 115 of the 175 buildings, representing more than half the area, were demolished. The number of residents living in the area had dropped from a high of 12,068 in 1950 to a low of 3,844 in 1970 (although they had recovered slightly to 4,651 in 1990). =2000-2004 renovation and repurposing= At the beginning of the 21st century, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was relatively unused. A few small city and county agencies and offices had leased space on the structure's ground floor, while the remainder of the building was used for storage or was empty. Although the building had never been renovated in the past 85 years, it was in good condition. It was also the largest building in the Warehouse District which had yet to undergo demolition or redevelopment. In February 2000, Bingham Burnside LLC, a company established by owners and executives of the Burnside Construction Co. of Chicago, initiated a process to purchase the Bingham building for an undisclosed sum. Bingham Burnside sought to redevelop the structure into a mixed-use development. The company planned spending $66.7 million ($ in dollars) on converting of space into 339 apartments, of space into a 340-vehicle parking garage, and of space into ground-floor retail. Bingham Burnside hired Marous Brothers Construction as the general contractor overseeing the project, which it hoped to begin on April 1, 2001. To pay for the conversion, Bingham Burnside received a $2 million ($ in dollars) loan from the city of Cleveland, $7.4 million ($ in dollars) in historic preservation tax credits from the state; and a $7.8 million ($ in dollars) conservation easement from the state. The city also agreed to give the developers a 75 percent tax abatement for the project's first five years, a 50 percent tax abatement for its next five years, and a 25 percent tax abatement in its 11th and 12th years. Relocation of tenants was nearly complete by early June 2002, somewhat behind schedule. By then, the cost of converting the building had risen to $70 million ($ in dollars). The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded Bingham Burnside a $41.8 million ($ in dollars) conversion loan. The Bingham became the largest HUD- financed project in Ohio to date. The loan allowed construction on the project to begin in the fall of 2002, with construction expected to be completed in summer 2003. Unanticipated construction delays meant that the Bingham apartments did not open until May 2004. The final cost of the conversion was $80 million ($ in dollars). In late 2004, Constantino's Market opened in of space on the ground floor of the Burnham on W. 9th Street. The space, a former showroom for W. Bingham Co. hardware goods, was restored and conserved. Although the space was broken up by several columns, these were reutilized as display shelves. Constantino's received a $380,000 ($ in dollars) below-market loan from the city to help pay for the space's renovation. =Conversion awards= The conversion of the warehouse won two awards. The first was the Downtown Development Award, given by the Downtown Cleveland Partnership in March 2005 to Bingham Burnside . The second Award for Excellence in Renovation (Other Buildings), given by the Northern Ohio Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties to Marous Brothers Construction in May 2005. =Ownership changes= Burnside Construction suffered severe economic losses during the Great Recession of 2008–2010, and in May 2007 filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation). Although The Bingham apartment building was 80 percent full and Constantino's was expanding its space on the ground floor, Bingham Burnside LLC was unable to make its loan payments without the support of its parent company. HUD seized the mortgage and title to the building, and actioned off the mortgage. Resource Real Estate bought the loan for $25 million in March 2010, and successfully completed a foreclosure proceeding against Bingham Burnside. Resource Real Estate won court approval to sell The Bingham in July 2010 in order to satisfy the mortgage. Resource Real Estate won the November 1, 2010, auction for The Bingham. The company said it planned no major changes at the complex, but would make cosmetic improvements to the common areas.

Its purpose was to give the youth that had fled South Africa after the 1976 Soweto uprising and children of existing exiles a primary and secondary education, an alternative to traditional Bantu education system they would have received at home. It would teach both an academic and vocational education. Farmlands would supply food to the institution and would also include a hospital. It was officially opened by Oliver Tambo in 1985.  History  The ANC's would establish its educational centre in Morogoro, Tanzania on land donated by the Tanzanian government during 1977, facilitated by Tanzanian Anna Abdallah. The land at Mazimbu, consisted of some farm buildings on 600 acres. The school would be named after the Solomon Mahlangu, a member of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and an exile of the 1976 Soweto uprising. Other names that had been suggested for the school before settled on the existing name where the Albert Luthuli Institute and the ANC Freedom School. The complex was built by Oswald Dennis, an ANC civil engineer trained in East Germany. He would later be supported by architect Spenser Hodgson. Work started in July 1977, built by Tanzanian labourers and supervised by the ANC, while education began under trees or in the existing farm buildings. Eventually around eighty percent of the workforce would be made of Tanzanians. As this would be a boarding school, accommodation was required and so six units catering for 144 pupils were built, with eight students per room. The first dormitory was completed for occupation in late 1979 by pupils and teachers. By 1980, the land had been cleared, existing houses on the land renovated, a temporary water supply and sewage system in place and the buildings linked to the local electricity network. Future plans called for more dormitories, houses, kitchen and dining rooms as well as a library. Initially the plan for the facility was for a secondary school for exiles of the 1976 Soweto uprising and children of the pre-1976, but soon a pre-primary school was established and by 1984 it would be formally called the Charlotte Maxeke Children's Centre. The centre started in the late 70's as a crèche, first in the town itself before being moved back into a renovated house at SOMAFCO in 1981 as a crèche and nursery school. The centre would open in 1984, built by Oswald Dennis from money supplied by the Swedish Teachers' Union. By 1985 a primary school was formally established. In 1980, New Zealanders Terry and Barbara Bell arrived in Tanzania to establish the primary school which operated out of one of the renovated houses though overcrowding meant some had to attend primary school in town. All teaching occurred in English. The Bell's left in 1982 after clashing over the style of the school management. Dennis and Hazel September took over the management of the primary school and the style of teaching changed to a more conventional one of grade and performance measures. Food for the facility was supplied from the farms' land which would supply milk, eggs, pork, beef and maize. Hans Jurgen's expertise as an agricultural consultant would provided by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. He would set about constructing a farm plan to make the facility self-sufficient by 1984 for 2,500 residents. Teachers and students were expected spend a time each week working on the farms. Security for the complex was provided by the Tanzania People's Defence Force. Medical issues were initially conducted by a clinic at the institution but when politics and personal issues took hold there in the early eighties and with the increase in the need to supply more sophisticated medical treatments, the ANC decided that a hospital should be built. Later called the ANC-Holland Solidarity Hospital, it was opened on 1 May 1984. A solidarity group in the Netherlands under Henk Odenk would finance it and the ANC was responsible for its construction. The furniture factory was financed out of Finland and would open in 1980 and was called the Vuyisile Mini Furniture Factory, named after Vuyisile Mini an executed MK soldier. In addition to repairing broken furniture it would supply the building projects with doors, window frames and furniture.  Teaching and curriculum  Teachers where recruited from three main sources. Firstly from ANC members with professional qualifications, secondly from matriculated members of the organisation and lastly overseas volunteer teachers who supported the aims of the ANC. The ANC wished to emphasise the teaching of what it called the hard sciences, subjects such as science and biology, subjects that were not regularly taught to black pupils in South Africa under the governments Bantu Education policy and which there was a shortage of amongst its own teachers. The source of teachers would initially come from Europe such as the United Kingdom, Nordic countries, the Netherlands and GDR and then later from Nigeria, Zambia and Tanzania. The students were educated only in English, with both a traditional non-Bantu education and political education. Subjects by the late 80's included English, Maths, History, Geography, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Agricultural Science, Typing, Integrated Science, Technical drawing, Development of Societies, Literature and History of the Struggle. The latter three were examined internally with the other subjects examined externally in the UK as GCE O level examinations. The secondary school consisted of six forms or grades and classes took place from Monday to Friday with a uniform worn though not strictly enforced. Corporal punishment though not officially allowed did occur from time to time and depended on the teacher concerned. Tertiary education was not conducted by the college but through means of scholarships, worthy candidates received further education in British, European and American universities while Communist countries also assisted but mainly in the spheres of agriculture, paramedical workers and engineers as well as other technical skills.

Most of the ANCs Scandinavian countries donations went into education with Norway and Sweden contributing $12 million in 1985 and $25 million by 1988. The latter's aid was provided by the Swedish International Developmental Cooperation Agency. Other donations for the work came from the German Democratic Republic, Soviet Union, United Nations Development Programme, World Health Organization (WHO) solidarity organisations and individuals.  Closure  On its closure on 9 September 1992, the educational complex consisted of a pre-primary, primary and secondary school, the farm, furniture factory and other support units. The infrastructure that remained behind was integrated into the Sokoine University of Agriculture. In 1991, the National Co-ordinating Committee on for the Return of Exiles set up the Batlagae Trust, who through the means of bursaries, would integrate the school's pupils back into the South African education system on their return to the country. The school's archives now rest at the University of Fort Hare. The documents began to arrive in September 1992 and stored in Centre for Cultural Studies before being moved to the Howard Pim Library in 1995.

It is located at 603 Main Street, in a classical revival-style building designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, and completed in July 1931. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  Description  The Racine Main Post Office is a three-story rectangular building, located two blocks from the shore of Lake Michigan. The dimensions of the lot are 89 feet by 160 feet. The building is faced primarily with Bedford limestone from Indiana, except for parts of the obscured south facade which are covered with red brick. Built on a slope, the main entrance is located on the second floor, on the west facade facing Main Street. This side of the building is adorned with six Corinthian columns, reaching 22 feet up from the top of the front steps to the portico. On the frieze, the words \\"United States Post Office\\" and an eagle are engraved. The building's north facade, along Sixth Street, features a row of Corinthian pilasters between each set of windows. The east facade faces Lake Street, and the ground floor features the loading dock and faces the building's parking lot. The south side is obscured by the McMynn Towers apartment building and an attached public parking structure. At the west end of this side, a wheelchair ramp offers handicap access to the office's front counter. At the east end, facing the parking lot, a retaining wall has been painted with a mural that features a bald eagle in front of the rising sun, labeled \\"Racine - A Nice Place to Live\\". The interior of the building is supported by an inner framework of reinforced concrete around steel. Aside from the front counter and mailbox area, the majority of the building consists of large open spaces where mail is processed. The second-story workroom is lit by two large skylights, which occupy a square area of the roof where the top floor is cut out of the rectangular structure. A short chimney stands in the center of the roof.  History  Regular federal mail service to the town of Racine began in 1836, when a post office was established at the rapids of the Root River, although it was moved into the town itself later that year. Being the area's first post office, it served areas as distant as Lake Geneva.Simmons, James. Annals of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1835-1897, Lake Geneva Herald, 1897.

Biography  Justin Kokolo was born into a Bakongo family in 1913 in Mayombe, Belgian Congo. He voluntarily enlisted in the Force Publique in 1936, quickly reaching the ranks of corporal and sergeant. He was one of four Congolese soldiers in the entire army to achieve the rank of adjutant before the independence of the Congo. Kokolo maintained close connections with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, a fellow Mukongo, who sought his protection from undisciplined troops. On 8 July 1960 Kokolo, as the most senior of the adjutants, was appointed by the Congolese government to be commander of the Camp Léopold II garrison. He soon thereafter achieved the rank of colonel and became deputy chief of staff of the army—renamed the Armée Nationale Congolaise. On 11 July Kokolo was dispatched from Léopoldville to Élisabethville, Katanga to oversee the \\"Africanisation\\" of the garrison's officers. However, that evening the provincial government seceded from the Congo and Kokolo was immediately expelled from its territory upon his arrival. From there he flew to Luluabourg to report on the situation to the president and prime minister. On 21 November Kokolo attempted to force his way into the Ghanaian embassy in Léopoldville to carry out an extradition order against the chargé d'affaires.

Doe also caught 42 passes for 379 yards and a touchdown, plus rushing for 143 yards on 19 carries. Doe earned several letters during his time in college. Professional career =Pittsburgh Steelers= Despite being undrafted during the 2015 NFL Draft, Doe participated in rookie mini- camps with the New England Patriots and Houston Texans, but remained unsigned until August, when Doe was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Doe participated in four preseason games, including the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, but was cut prior to the final week of preseason play. Doe participated exclusively on special teams, and returned 2 kickoffs for 43 yards, and 8 punts for 26 yards, with 1 fumble, which Doe then promptly recovered. =Brooklyn Bolts= After being cut by the Steelers, Doe played for the Brooklyn Bolts in the startup Fall Experimental Football League during their brief 2015 season, which was their final season before folding in early 2016. Lead by quarterback Josh Freeman, and alongside fellow future CFL players John Harris, Ricky Collins, and LaDarius Perkins, Doe recorded 2 catches for 28 yards during the two games played that season, including one game which took place during storms influenced by Hurricane Joaquin. Doe also served as a returner during his time with the Bolts. =Edmonton Eskimos= Following his stints with the Steelers and the FXFL in 2015, Doe began receiving calls by Canadian Football teams in January 2016, and signed with the Edmonton Eskimos on his birthday, June 6. During the 2 game CFL preseason, Doe recorded two catches for 23 yards, 6 punt returns for 27 yards, and two kickoff returns for 42 yards. Doe made the active roster for the Eskimos, but was demoted to the practice roster after the first game. Doe was called back up in week 4 to become the starting returner for Edmonton, taking over for the struggling Joe McKnight. Doe ended up being demoted again during week 16, in favor of Troy Stoudermire. Stoudermire went on to have higher return averages, but fumbled several times over only a few touches over four games, something Doe only did only once in nearly a full season as a returner. Following Edmonton's postseason defeat, Doe was cut in January 2017. Doe finished his year in Edmonton with 45 kickoff returns for 937 yards, 56 punt returns for 437 yards, and 5 missed field-goal returns for 192 yards. Doe also had one catch for 13 yards. He was criticized for not accepting better field position by accepting kneels downs and therefore sacrificing single points to opposing teams on returns, but also provided stability to the Edmonton special teams, despite having poor blocking in front of him. One of Doe's most memorable plays was a return where he was tackled by his undershirt. While running the ball back, a member of the Saskatchewan Roughriders grabbed at Doe's shirt, which tore away. Doe was then reeled in by the threads of his shirt like a fishing line, slowing him enough for other players to tackle him. =The Spring League= Doe participated in the 2017 Spring League in West Virginia. This developmental league pairs veterans and younger players with NFL coaches to help them gain exposure to professional teams. During his time in the Spring League, Doe, appearing on both the \\"West\\" and \\"South\\" rosters, played with teammates such as Ben Tate and McLeod Bethel-Thompson, and faced opposing players such as Greg Hardy, Ahmad Bradshaw, Anthony Dixon, and Ricky Stanzi. During the first game of Spring League play, Doe faced his former Brooklyn Bolts coach Terry Shea, who was coaching the opposing East Roster, which also included Doe's former Bolts teammate, Manasseh Garner. =Nebraska Danger= On October 30, 2017, Doe signed with an arena football team, the Nebraska Danger of the IFL. In the season opener vs. the Cedar Rapids Titans, Doe scored the first touchdown of the 2018 IFL Season when he took an end-around for a score as part of a 44-31 Nebraska victory. Doe was the only receiver to play all 14 regular season games for Nebraska, hauling in 37 passes for 352 yards and 5 touchdowns. Doe's other stats included 16 rushes for 52 yards and a score, as well as throwing a pass for a 3 yard touchdown, 3 tackles on defense, and committing two fumbles. Doe also converted a pair of 2 point conversions, one as a passer and one as a receiver, and throughout the season served as the team long snapper. During Nebraska's playoff game, Doe was the most productive receiver for Nebraska, catching three passes for 48 yards in the 48-17 loss to the top seeded Iowa Barnstormers. Doe became a free agent on September 5th 2018.https://www.dangerfootball.com/transactions/ Personal life Doe was born to Myra Blackwell and Kenneth Doe. His stepfather is Dale Blackwell. Prior to his time at Wisconsin, Doe had not lost a football game since he was 13 years old, going 103-0. During 2016, Doe lost two former teammates and/or roommates due to gun violence. Calgary Stampeders defensive back Mylan Hicks, Doe's teammate from the Brooklyn Bolts was killed in a shooting at a Calgary nightclub, and Edmonton teammate Joe McKnight was murdered in an incident of road rage. Doe is close friends with feller Badger Melvin Gordon and works for Gordon in marketing Gordon's personal brand.

Personal life Suzanne Hopper was a 12-year veteran Deputy Sheriff with the Clark County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) and former Officer of the Year. She won multiple gold medals in Police Olympics weightlifting competitions. She was known for once going six years straight without a sick day. After her first daughter was born in 1992 with special needs, Hopper became involved in charity events for causes like the Special Olympics, for which she started a local volleyball fundraiser in 2008. She married her second husband, Matthew Hopper, in 2010. She had two children from her first marriage, Emily Bauer and Charles Waughtel, and two stepchildren, Madeleine and Cole Hopper. After Matthew Hopper died on 10 April 2014 at the age of 38 following a battle with cancer, the children were taken in by Suzanne Hopper's parents, Charles and Bonnie Bauer. Shooting On 1 January 2011, Deputy Hopper was responding to a call about shots being fired at the Enon Beach mobile-home park with her partner Sergeant Dustin White. Around 11:35a.m., while her partner was interviewing the family whose trailer had been shot at, Hopper was shot at very close range while she was attempting to photograph a footprint. The gunman pointed a H&R; 12-gauge break-action shotgun at her from inside his trailer and shot her with no warning. According to Clark County Sheriff Gene Kelly, Hopper \\"never had the opportunity to return fire or take cover\\". A gun battle erupted between the suspect and other responding officers as they attempted to retrieve Hopper's body. According to an eyewitness, one officer attempted desperately to reach Hopper's body: he repeatedly asked over radio if he could get her but was denied because the scene was not secure. The police used a loudspeaker to ask the suspect to surrender himself for several minutes, before returning fire on his trailer and killing him. A German Township officer, Jeremy Blum, was also wounded. He was flown to Miami Valley Hospital in stable condition. The proximity between the Enon Beach trailer park and Interstate 70 led to the highway being closed for about an hour. =Gunman= The gunman was identified as 57-year-old Michael Ferryman, who had a history of mental illness and violence. A girl living in the same trailer park described him as \\"a quiet person\\" who became unpleasant if angered. He was previously involved in another shootout with police in 2001, in Morgan County, for which he had been found not guilty due to insanity. He was released and supposed to be under supervision, but according to Clark County Sheriff Gene Kelly \\"the supervision failed\\" and there was no notification that Ferryman had moved to Clark County. Sheriff Kelly said if they had been aware of Ferryman's history, Hopper's response to the initial call would have been much more careful. Ferryman's girlfriend was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of giving Ferryman the gun used to kill Hopper. Legacy A funeral service was held on 7 January 2011, attended by thousands of officers from across the United States despite heavy snowfall. A 1,600-vehicle procession traversed Clark County. Hopper was posthumously awarded \\"deputy of the year\\". During a speech given in May 2012 at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service, President Barack Obama honored Hopper's memory. A Springfield News-Sun photo of the event was later named in Life Magazine's \\"most memorable photos of the year\\". The video footage of the shootout was featured in the final episode of World's Wildest Police Videos. A segment of Interstate 70 was renamed \\"Deputy Suzanne Hopper Memorial Highway\\". =Suzanne Hopper Act= The Suzanne Hopper Act is a law intended to create a database usable by law enforcement to track violent offenders ruled as mentally ill by Ohio courts. In June 2013, the bill was sponsored by Republican state senators Chris Widener of Springfield and Bill Beagle of Tipp City, and was signed into law by governor John Kasich. The law is credited with multiple instances of improving officer safety.

Shiva is worshipped as Bhaktajaneswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Manonmani Amman. The temple is located on the Panruti - Kedilam road. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is closely associated with Sundarar, who is believed to have attained grace at this place. The temple complex covers an area of two acres and all its shrines are enclosed with concentric rectangular walls. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Bhaktajaneswarar, his consort Manonmani Amman and Ranganathar being the most prominent. The temple has three daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. Sundarar Janana festival during the Tamil month of Aavani (August - September) and Sundarar Guru Poojai during the month of Aadi are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, with later additions from different ruling dynasties. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend and history The main shrines of the temple As per Hindu legend, during the churning of the Ocean of milk, a sperm fell at this place to originate as a \\"Naval\\" tree. It came to be known as Jambuvanam and over the period of several eons, a temple formed in the place. The place thus came to be known as Navalur while presiding deity came to be known as Thirunavleesan. As per another legend, Sukra (Venus) obtained the diving elixir that could bring back dead people. During the fight between Devas, the celestial deities and Asuras, the demons, Sukra helped the Asuras by bringing them back to life repeatedly. The Devas complained it to Shiva, who swallowed Sukra. He then brought him back to life and installed him as one of the Navagrahas, the planetary deities. He also instructed him to help devotees based on the deeds. Sundarar, an 8th-century saivite saint was born in the place and believed to have attained divinity by worshipping Shiva at the place. The place is also believed to be the one where Adisesha got back his original colour attained on account of the poison. Brahma is believed to have worshipped the deity during Dvapara Yuga, while Sivapriyar, who went on to become Chandekeswarar worshipped the deity during Treta Yuga. History The original structure is believed to be existent from time immemorial, while the later additions are believed to have been built by Cholas, Pallavas, while the present masonry structure was built during the 16th century. As per inscriptions from the period of Parantaka I, there were seemingly three Shiva temples and one Vishnu temple in the place. One of the three, a Pallava temple named Kalinarisvaram, was destroyed by the locals. The inscriptions during the 32nd regnal year Parantaka I (recorded as 348 of 1902) mentions gifts to the Vishnu temple by Rajaditta-devar for perpetual lighting of the temple. The other two Shiva temples are called Rajaditta Isvarattu Mahadevar temple and Agasteeswaram (recorded as 347 of 1902). While Agasteeswaram cannot be traced, Rajaditta Isvarattu Mahadevar temple (also called Rajaditta Isvaram) is the Bhaktajaneeswarar temple. The other inscriptions in the temple indicate the conversion of it to a stone temple from an earlier structure made of bricks. The inscriptions from Kannara-deva (Rashtrakuta Krishna III), mentions the Kannaradeva defeating the Cholas and death of Rajaditya during the Takkolam war. There are inscriptions from later Chola emperors like Rajaraja Chola I (985–1014), Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1120) and Rajendra Chola III (1246–1279). In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Bhaktajaneswarar temple is located in a village called Thirunavalur on Viluppuram - Kedilam main road. The temple has a flat entrance tower facing South, and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The central shrine is approached through pillared halls. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Bhaktajaneswarar in the form of Lingam (an iconic form of Shiva). The shrine of Manonmani Amman, facing South, is located in separate shrine around the first precinct. The central shrine is approached through a Mahamandapam and Arthamandapam. The sanctum is a square structure measuring , while the rectangular ardhamandapa projects . The notable features of the outer structure of the sanctum has yali friezes, kumudam mouldings, Bhootaganas and dancing figures. As in other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, the shrines of Vinayaka, Murugan, Navagraha, Chandekeswara and Durga are located around the precinct of the main shrine. The second precinct also has a shrine of Ranganatha and a garden around the periphery of the compound wall. The shrine of Sundarar is located in the north eastern corner of the precinct. Sundarar is sported in standing posture along with his two consorts on either sides. Religious importance and festivals Sundarar, an 8th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Bhaktajaneswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Ninth Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. During three days of March, the Sun rays fall directly on the image in the sanctum. The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed three times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Bhaktajaneswarar and Gnanambigai. Unlike other shiva temples, anointing with oil is not performed in the temple. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham, and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Sundarar Janana festival during the Tamil month of Aavani (August - September) and Sundarar Guru Poojai during the month of Aadi are the most important festivals of the temple.

Plot Michal (Noa Koler) is an unwed Orthodox Jewish woman in her early 30s. After over a decade of unsuccessful matches, Michal goes to a fortune teller (Odelia Moreh-Matalon) and admits she wants to love and be loved. The woman tells Michal that her dreams will come true, and also tells Michal that her son, Shimi (Amos Tamam), runs a wedding hall in Jerusalem promising her a discount if she marries there. Sometime later Michal and her husband-to-be, Gidi (Erez Drigues), are at the tasting for their wedding. Sensing his discomfort Michal asks her fiancé to tell her what's wrong and he confesses that he doesn't love her. She decides to break off the engagement. After talking to her family and realizing that she cannot go through another decade of uncertainty, Michal decides to go through with renting the hall and to continue to prepare for her marriage as planned without her original fiancé, leaving it up to God to decide on a groom. Michal goes on a series of increasingly unsuccessful dates: first with a man (Udi Persi) who has taken a vow not to look at anyone who is not his wife, next with a deaf man (Jonathan Rozen) who becomes angered that she only agreed to see him after falling into despair, and he senses she is flirting with his sign language interpreter. Michal later makes the pilgrimage to the grave of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov where she is overcome with grief and cries aloud that she cannot feel God. The grave of Rabbi Nachman where she has been praying is separated between men and women, and a man on the other side of the barrier overhears Michal and asks her if she is alright. The man reveals himself outside the grave to be Yoss (Oz Zehavi), an Israeli pop star who Michal is a fan of. During their conversation Michal reveals that she is planning to get married on the last day of Hanukkah but has yet to find a groom and invites Yoss to her wedding. On her return from her trip Yoss surprises Michal by dropping by her apartment unannounced, and again asks her to marry him, but Michal rejects him, believing that he is not serious. As the date of her wedding approaches and no groom presents himself she begins to panic after more bad dates and tries to reconnect with Yoss, even proposing to him, but he kindly rejects her. The night before her wedding Michal is filled with conflicting emotions as her mother (Irit Sheleg) doubts her completely, yet her sister and friends begin to have faith. The wedding party travels to the wedding hall where the guests wait in discomfort for something to happen. Shimi finally appears and asks Michal to marry him. Initially believing that she is hallucinating and later that Shimi is only acting out of pity, Michal agrees to marry Shimi after he reminds her of the first time they met; not at the taste test for her wedding, but at his mother's house.

It was originally a small, independent rural community that developed along the Mississippi river in northern East Baton Rouge Parish. Only one African- American family lived in the village in 1914 when Southern University and A&M; College was relocated to this community. Originally based in New Orleans, the university was designated in 1890 as the state's land grant college for African Americans, when education was segregated in the state. Gradually Scotlandville became industrialized, beginning with a Standard Oil refinery in 1909, and was a destination of African Americans to urban areas in the Great Migration beginning around World War I. Its growth was stimulated also by construction of railroads along the Mississippi River. While still independent, Scotlandville became the largest majority-black community in the state. In the 20th century, it was incorporated into Baton Rouge. History In an area long occupied by indigenous peoples, Scotlandville was gradually settled after the United States acquired this territory. It was a rural area farmed after the Civil War by an assortment of European Americans and freedmen. The only African-American family living in the village before the establishment of Southern University in 1914 was that of William \\"Dreher\\" Kelly and his wife Priscilla. The area was mostly farmland into the early 20th century, with other black farmers and sharecroppers.Rachel L. Emanuel, Ruby Jean Simms, Charles Vincent, Scotlandville, Arcadia Publishing, 2015, pp.12-13 In 1912 the state of Louisiana bought 531 acres in Scotlandville for the construction of the relocated Southern University and A&M; College, a historically black college and land grant college. The state legislature wanted it moved from New Orleans to an area with more land. The state later acquired another 372 acres to support the agricultural portion of its curriculum. Southern University was built on Scott's Bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. When Standard Oil Company opened a processing plant here in 1909, it attracted many new workers, including rural black migrants from other areas of the state, and immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. It operated for decades, providing good jobs for graduates of Southern University. After World War II, black veterans such as Acie Belton of Scotlandville organized voter registration drives in order to overcome the disenfranchisement of most African Americans. In 1946 there were only 137 black voters registered in East Baton Rouge Parish. In the next few years, he and others increased the number of black registered voters in the parish to more than 2,000, mostly from Scotlandville. Knowing that engagement in politics was critical, they and other leaders continued with civil rights activities into the 1960s and later. They established the Second Ward Voters League during this early registration movement, and it still is active in evaluating and endorsing candidates.Emanuel et al., Scotlandville 2015, p. 115 Government and infrastructure Today Scotlandville is a community within Baton Rouge and overseen by its government. the East Baton Rouge Parish government.

History The R.S. McLaughlin Building, built in the Gothic Revival style, was one of the first automobile dealerships in Toronto. It was constructed by General Motors Corporation of Canada, and was completed in May, 1925, seven years after General Motors had completed a merger with Oshawa's McLaughlin Motor Car Company. The building remained continuously occupied by car dealerships for eighty-two years. In 1955, it was opened as a Cadillac dealership by Harry Addison, and was known as Addison on Bay. It later became Canada's largest Cadillac dealership, and by the 1980s was operated by former Member of Parliament John Hollings Addison. Despite its long history, the dealership was closed as part of a reorganization and consolidation of the car dealership industry in Canada. By 1989, it was listed on Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties, and designated a Heritage Property by City Council in 1999 under the Ontario Heritage Act (part IV). The latter designation required any property owner to apply to the City of Toronto prior to making changes or demolishing its historic elements. Substantial restoration took place in 1999, including modification for rooftop parking. In 2000, Ontario Realty Corporation sold the site to Addison Properties Ltd. for what some claim was one-third of its value. The building was removed to make way for the Burano high-rise condominium, with plans to retain the facade and other historic elements of the original structure and incorporate them into the Burano's lower three floors. Because of the soft soil at the site, and to facilitate excavation, the historic facade was dismantled and stored off-site during construction of the seven-floor underground garage. After the garage and foundation appropriate for the fifty floors above ground were completed, the facade was reconstructed, incorporating the important heritage components. The historic building is marked with a plaque, placed in 2013 by Heritage Toronto.

He was feared all the more due to his blindness.Brian W. Jones, The Emperor Domitian (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 57 Bartolomeo Borghesi supposed Messalinus was the son of Statilia Messalina, third wife of Nero, but by a previous marriage. However, as Ronald Syme pointed out, that \\"would make her older than Otho (who was born in 32), and bring her close in age to Valeria Messalina.\\"Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, (Oxford: University Press, 1986), p. 241 So in his stemma of the descendants of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, Syme makes Statilia and Catullus Messalinus sister and brother.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, \\"Table IX, Messalla Corvinus\\" However, Rutledge identifies the parents of Messalinus as Valerius Catullus and Statilia Messalina. It is unclear how he is related to the suffect consul of AD 31, Sextus Tedius Valerius Catullus, the only other consular Valerius Catullus.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 26 n. 13 Messalinus was twice consul. The first time was as consul ordinarius in AD 73, when he was the colleague of the emperor Domitian;Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 188, 213 Steven Rutledge observes this was \\"an exceptional honor, since of the twenty-four ordinary consulships held between 70 and 81, all but six were held by Vespasian and his sons.\\"Rutledge, Imperial Inquisitions: Prosecutors and informants from Tiberius to Domitian (London: Routledge, 2001), p. 274 The second time was as consul suffectus with Quintus Julius Cordinus Gaius Rutilius Gallicus for the nundinium of March to April 85.Gallivan, \\"Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", pp. 190, 216 That Messalinus held the consulate twice despite his blindness is a unique achievement: Richard Talbert notes that blindness would disqualify a man from membership in the Senate, let alone deprive him of seeking further office. Talbert cites the jurist Ulpian's opinion on this, as well as Dio Cassius' statement that in 13 BC Augustus would not consider anyone who was disabled for the Senate.Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), pp 9f Messalinus must have proven his worth to Domitian for the emperor to make these exceptions. The names of none of the targets of his accusations or prosecutions have come down to us. Until August 93, Messalinus did not make any accusations in the Senate, instead playing a role behind the scenes in the consilium of the emperor Domitian;Rutledge, Imperial Inquisitions, pp. 274f Tacitus writes how the \\"noisy counsels of Messalinus were not heard beyond the walls of Alba.\\"Tacitus, Agricola, 45.1 Nonetheless, he is not known to have held any other official posts. Messalinus had died by AD 97, the date of a dinner party hosted by emperor Nerva, the successor of Domitian, where he asked, \\"If he had gone on living, what do you think would have become of him?\\"Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, IV.22.4-6  References  Category:Ancient Roman politicians Category:Blind politicians Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:1st-century Romans Category:90s deaths ","title":"Lucius Valerius Catullus Messalinus"},{"id":"54039835","title":"Peru at major beauty pageants"},{"id":"54039836","title":"Poland at major beauty pageants"},{"id":"54039842","text":"Lizard Pond is located in the Adirondack Mountains southwest of Garnet Lake, New York.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non- flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a green and white flower with reddish-brown stripes and a sharply pointed dorsal sepal. Description Pterostylis dolichochila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of four to ten egg-shaped leaves. Each leaf is 4–12 mm long and 3–8 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 20–25 mm long and 7–9 mm wide borne on a spike 50–150 mm high with three or four stem leaves wrapped around it. The flowers are green and white with reddish-brown stripes. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with sharp point or a thread-like tip 1–2 mm long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, thread-like tip 15–20 mm long and a broad, flat sinus between their bases. The labellum is 13–15 mm long, about 4 mm wide, brown, blunt, and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from April to August. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis dolichochila was first formally described in 1985 by David Jones and Mark Clements and the description was published in the fourth edition of Flora of South Australia. The specific epithet (dolichochila) is derived from the Ancient Greek words dolichos meaning \\"long\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\". Distribution and habitat The long-tongued shell orchid grows on calcareous sand and limestone, sometimes forming large colonies, in mallee in the south- east of South Australia and the Little Desert and Big Desert areas of Victoria.

The present bishop is Brian Melvin Marajh. History On 23 April 1811 a portion of the District of Swellendam, East of the Gouritz River, was proclaimed a separate district and named George Town after the reigning British monarch, King George III. In the following year the Dutch Reformed Church appointed its first minister and soon after that the London Missionary Society established a mission station at Hooge Kraal (1813). The town which developed around the Mission later became known as Pacaltsdorp, so named after their long serving minister, the Reverend Charles Pacalt. In 1841 the Roman Catholic Church appointed its first priest in George and 1843 saw the completion of their church building. George Town was one of the few villages in which the Government had placed a Colonial Chaplain to serve the English community. He was permitted to use the Dutch Church for Anglican services and in 1848 a meeting was held to discuss ways and means of establishing a church of their own, so subscription lists were opened to collect funds. In February 1848 Bishop Gray, father of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, arrived in the Cape. It was most opportune that his wife Sophy, who designed the George church, should have accompanied him on his first visitation. This gave her the singular honour of laying the foundation stone on 23 October 1849 and this little church was consecrated as St. Marks Church by Bishop Gray on 7 December 1850. The South and North Transepts were both donated by Dr. R A St Leger: the former in memory of his first wife Annie Brett in 1934 and the latter some 20 years later in memory of his father, Frederick York St Leger. The North Transept was built simultaneously with the Chapel of St Mary, commonly known as the Lady Chapel, and these were consecrated on the 15 June 1954. The Chapel was in memory of Bishop Sidwell, the first Bishop of George, and the men from this area who fell in the two World Wars. The first columbarium was built in the Graveyard in 1963 and the second in 1971 from stone donated by one of the parishioners. New choir stalls were installed in the Chancel in 1964 only to be moved to their present position in more recent times. Pew heating in alternate pews was installed in 1968 and the old flooring needed to be replaced with treated timber in 1984. The few remaining yellow wood pews were by then very fragile and a St Leger Memorial Bequest enabled the Church to replace them with matching meranti pews. The actual date of the building of the Porch cannot be determined with accuracy but it would seem that the only meaningful renovations between 1861 and 1924 were in 1906 and from other evidence this would appear to be a very likely date. The Cathedral was re-roofed in 1964 and the roof tiles above the Lady Chapel and the two Transept were replaced in 1988. The corner stone of the Chapter House was laid in September 1978. THE CATHEDRAL TIMELINE 1848 Decision taken to raise money for church building. Bishop Gray and his wife Sophy arrived in Cape Town. The Bishop's wife designed the church and the foundation stone was laid on 23 October 1849 1850 The church was consecrated on 7 December 1850. Four stonemasons were employed from Scotland and the stone was quarried at Victoria Heights. The church seated 200 congregants 1865 Building alterations and extensions commenced in 1861 and were completed in 1865. The alterations cost £475. Access to the Chancel was through a high archway set further back in the Nave and an organ chamber was constructed in the northern side of the Chancel, while the Vestry led off the southern side. Three stained glass windows were set into the eastern wall 1874-1908 Original harmonium was replaced, the first organ was purchased, and a porch was added. 1911 St Mark's parish church became a Cathedral 1924 Further alterations to the Cathedral were undertaken.

Love Actually writer and director Richard Curtis returns alongside cast members Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Andrew Lincoln, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, Lúcia Moniz, Olivia Olson, Marcus Brigstocke, and Rowan Atkinson. The film was first broadcast on BBC One on 24 March 2017 as a part of Red Nose Day. A slightly different version of the film, featuring Laura Linney reprising her role and Patrick Dempsey, was broadcast in the US on 25 May 2017.  Story  The film is set in March 2017, 13 years after the events of the original film. Juliet is watching television with her husband Peter. When the doorbell rings and she opens the door, Juliet finds Mark, who, similarly to 13 years ago, communicates with her by using cue cards, having her pretend to Peter, this time, that he is a fund raiser for Red Nose Day. They tell each other that they are very happy with their respective lives, and Mark presents his new wife, who is none other than Kate Moss, whom, 13 years prior, he jokingly said he was going to marry. Mark's final card proposes that they see what happened to the rest of their friends. David, who has lost and recently regained his position as Prime Minister since the first film, dances in his official residence once again, even continuing in great pain after falling down the stairs. His lover and former employee Natalie amicably reprimands him, and offers to make him tea. Later in a public speech, he states that although times are harder for a lot of people now, he still believes that love and the good in people will win in the end. Billy Mack recently released a charity single, a cover of the ZZ Top song \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\". As the reporter interviewing him on radio tries to help him raise awareness for Red Nose Day, Billy openly admits to not care about children (except for the ones that buy his discs) and that he only promotes the charity to, in truth, get free publicity for his upcoming autobiography, which he has admittedly neither written nor read. He then reveals with sadness that his manager Joe has died from a heart attack since the first film, before stating that the greatest sex he ever had was with one of the Kardashians, although he cannot remember which one. Salesman Rufus proposes, among his products, a red nose in honour of Red Nose Day. When a child buys one and agrees to having it gift wrapped, Rufus proceeds with great delight to take an absurdly excessive amount of time doing so, the waiting line soon becoming so long that it blocks car traffic outside. Meanwhile, on their way to pick up their kids from school, Jamie and his wife Aurélia recall their first days together. Aurélia says in Portuguese that even though life makes it impossible to be completely happy, love sometimes makes you feel like you are. She then reveals to Jamie that she is pregnant with their fourth child, though he misunderstands her and believes she was telling him what was for dinner. Sitting on a bench, Daniel receives a surprise visit from his stepson Sam, who is now 26 and lives in New York City. When Daniel expresses concern because Sam had not been in touch, he is surprised to see Joanna, Sam's childhood crush 13 years ago who had left for America. She asks for Sam's hand, and Daniel, delighted, jokingly answers that he will think about it. The film then ends with footage showing various people and actions supported by Comic Relief, and some of the film's cast wearing red noses.  Cast  * Hugh Grant as David * Liam Neeson as Daniel * Colin Firth as Jamie * Andrew Lincoln as Mark * Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peter * Keira Knightley as Juliet * Martine McCutcheon as Natalie * Bill Nighy as Billy Mack * Thomas Sangster as Sam * Lúcia Moniz as Aurélia * Olivia Olson as Joanna * Marcus Brigstocke as Mikey * Rowan Atkinson as Rufus * Kate Moss as herself * Victoria Derbyshire as Journalist * Charlie Stayt as Reporter * Jo Whiley as herself (voice) * Laura Linney as Sarah (US release) * Patrick Dempsey as Sarah’s husband (US release)  Production  Shooting began in February 2017, with the film being announced at the same time. The film was broadcast on BBC One as part of Red Nose Day on 24 March 2017. Among the returning cast are Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Sangster, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Marcus Brigstocke and Rowan Atkinson were all confirmed to return. Actors who did not return included Emma Thompson, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Rodrigo Santoro, Gregor Fisher, and the late Alan Rickman.  US version  An additional sequence with Laura Linney and Patrick Dempsey was shot after the UK airing, for the US broadcast on NBC on 25 May 2017. It features Linney's character, Sarah, answering her cell as if it were her brother calling as in the film, only to reveal the caller is Patrick Dempsey, who remarks that he loves the way she always answers her phone and that she is a wonderful wife, thus giving her character a decidedly happy ending. The US version also includes alternate versions of the two Rowan Atkinson scenes, set in the US. There are alternate exterior shots of the store he works in, which is now a Walgreens in Midtown Manhattan, replacing the unnamed suburban British store in the original. The US version has Walgreens signage and Red Nose Day banners with the US date, two months later than in the UK, behind Atkinson throughout his scenes. The young actor playing Atkinson's customer speaks slightly different dialogue, with an American accent this time, and Atkinson describes costs in dollars instead of pounds. The US version also replaces The Beach Boys' \\"God Only Knows\\" over the opening shots with a cue from Craig Armstrong's score for the original film.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Since 2003, it has been occupied by the Latin American Montessori Bilingual Public Charter School. History The Military Road School was established in 1864 to educate free-people of color. The site was formerly occupied by the barracks of Fort Stevens and was located on what was then Military Road, which connected Washington's Civil War forts. Many freedmen and women settled near forts for protection and employment. It was one of the first schools in Washington to open after Congress authorized the education of African Americans. The students who attended school came from the neighborhood, traveled from other parts of upper Northwest Washington as well as from Montgomery County, Maryland. The school remained open until 1954 when the Brown v. Board of Education decision desegregated public schools in the United States. Architecture The front part of the present school building was one of the first buildings designed by the office of the Municipal Architect, which had been established in 1909, and to be reviewed by the Commission of Fine Arts, which had been established in 1910. The two and a half story building was designed by Snowden Ashford. A large contemporary addition was completed behind the building in 2009. The building is faced with red brick and is accented by stucco panels and limestone trim. It is one room wide and has a central entrance porch. The large banks of multi-paned windows are located on the front and the sides of the building for maximum light. There are recessed brick panels on the back of the building. The gently flared hipped roof features wide scrolled eaves and is topped by an octagon shaped cupola.

The church and its complex sit towards the outskirts of the town, commanding views over Marsascala Bay, St. Thomas' Bay and Marsaxlokk harbour. The church is colloquially known as Saint Gregory's due to a traditional procession held on the first Wednesday following Easter Sunday. Its dedication to Catherine of Alexandria dates back to an original chapel on this site, which was one of the eight mother churches on Malta. The church stands next to the three cemeteries of Żejtun, dedicated to St. Rocco, St. Gregory and St. Catherine. The church's functions as the parish church of Żejtun were taken over by a new parish church, also dedicated to St. Catherine, and designed by Lorenzo Gafà. The present day church was built on the site of an older 15th century chapel, also dedicated to St. Catherine, along with an adjacent private chapel dedicated to St. Mark and St. Jacob. Late medieval texts prove that the church became a landmark for seafarers. Over the years, the chapel was restructured and enlarged, with the demolition of the adjacent private chapel. The extensions included the construction of a transept and a dome. The present day façade was probably altered in the 17th century, with the addition of a Renaissance doorway. St. Catherine's Old Church is a working church with prayer and daily mass services. The church is a Grade 1 scheduled building and is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Topography The church sits at the end of a saddle-backed ridge, running between Marsaxlokk, and St. Thomas' Bay and Marsascala. The other end of the ridge lies at the end of Delimara peninsula. The existing road network in area appears to have been largely formed by the early modern period. However, parts of it may be much older. The positioning of St. Catherine's Old Church appears to have been tied with the districts served by the parish. The church stands within 250 metres from the remains of a Roman villa. By walking across some fields due south of this villa, the existing road descends through Ras il-Wied to Marsaxlokk Bay, with the route representing the most efficient path from Żejtun down to the bay. The present-day road runs from St. Catherine's old church along the spine of the ridge, towards Xrobb l-Għaġin, before climbing the knoll of Tas-Silġ and descending to Marsaxlokk. This is not the most efficient route for the transportation of bulk commodities from Żejtun to the bay, and may have been shaped by historic considerations, such as linking the Roman villa with Tas- Silġ. The area also includes a number of Punic remains. A rock-cut tomb was discovered in June 1992, during the construction of an extension to the cemeteries near the church.  History  = Medieval chapel = The origins of the church are unclear. In the 19th century, historians linked the foundation of the church with the expulsion of the Arabs, following Count Roger's presumed raid in 1090/91. These links betrayed attempts to pre-date the veneration of St. Catherine of Alexandria with the Byzantine-Greek community living on Malta prior to the Muslim invasions of the 9th century. Modern historians, however, argue that Christianity in Malta was reintroduced by King Roger in 1127, and consolidated itself thereafter. Following Sicily, and on the Byzantine character of the iconography of post-Islamic times, it appears that Greek influence at first was supreme, though the Normans themselves usually favoured the Latin clergy, especially the higher clergy. Some historians maintain that the foundations of the old parish of Żejtun date back as early as the 12th century, when the musical sector of the Cathedral of Mdina was instituted, and the original chapel is in fact believed to have been built on land that formed part of the revenue of the Cathedral precentor – “La prebenda di santa Caterina.” The church continued to be funded by the Cathedral Precentor over the following centuries, with the coats of arms of several of incumbents appearing on the vestry walls. In any case, by the 14th century, a small early medieval chapel dedicated to St. Catherine served the south eastern region of Malta. It was already a parish church in the early 15th century, and was one of the eight mother churches on Malta. In fact, in 1436, the church appeared in the de Mello rollo. Bishop Senatore de Mello asked four cathedral canons to investigate and list all prebends, canons and other beneficiaries in the diocese of Malta, as well as the incomes and the names of all priests benefiting from these sources. In this list, or rollo, twelve chapels are listed as the first form of the islands' parishes. The chapel of St. Catherine of Żejtun was included in this list under the village name 'Bisqallin.' This chapel stood halfway between the two old cores of Żejtun, that is, half a mile distant from Bisqallin and Ħal Bisbut. This chapel had a rectangular shape, with a simple façade. It had a pointed arched entrance and roofed with the local xorok method. Probably, the present church was built on the footprint of the old chapel, with the current building's nave now corresponding with the old chapel walls. The old chapel's façade, however, was turned northwards - as is a statue of St. Gregory just outside the church grounds - and faced the Cathedral of Mdina, the old medieval capital in the centre of the island. The small and primitive medieval chapel served as the parish church of Żejtun for a long period of time. The lands administered from this chapel were very large. The parish incorporated the whole south-eastern portion of Malta, and was the farthest parish from the fortified city of Mdina. All the lands making up today's Żejtun, Ħaż-Żabbar, Ħal Għaxaq, San Ġorġ ta’ Birzebbugia, Marsaxlokk, Delimara, St. Thomas' Bay and Marsascala, as well as a number of other small villages and lost hamlets, all fell under the parish's direct responsibility. In addition to this wide territorial responsibility, or possibly because of it, the Church enjoyed a greater variety of ecclesiastical services and celebrations when compared to the other early parishes in Malta, with the Church being second only to the Mdina Cathedral. By 1470, the church building had become a recognised national and international landmark and shrine, with sailors commending themselves for the saint's intercession: \\"God help us and St. Catherine of Malta.\\" In fact, on the outer walls of the church, there are various maritime related graffiti.https://wirtizzejtunartikli.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/graffitti- fsan-girgor_arm2005.pdf St. Catherine was the protector of sailors and those who work in lighthouses. Other graffiti include the star of David punctured by an arrow. = Rebuilding and enlargement = Nave with true Gothic quadripartite vault at St. Catherine's Old Church. The original chapel remained in use until 1492, when it was rebuilt and enlarged. This was commemorated by an inscription, which has since been lost. The Maltese historian Gian Francesco Abela noted how the church was rebuilt, quoting this inscription in his writings. The same inscription was repeated by A. Ferris in 1866 and E.B. Vella in 1927. While there is a faded and partial Latin inscription in the dome, this reads differently from the one reported in other sources. According to this later inscription, the church was enlarged in 1606 during the episcopate of Bishop Gargallo, and the office of archpriest M. Burlo. This further enlargement must have consisted in the addition of a transept vaulted with a true Gothic quadripartite vault, which is an unusual feature in Maltese churches. The church also has a sizable parvis. Using information from the apostolic visit by Mgr. Pietro Dusina in 1575, Gian Francesco Abela noted how the Cathedral precentor drew around 500 scudi in annual income from the lands belonging to St. Catherine's Old Church. According to a number of inscriptions, the bosses of the arches' intersections in the rib-groins were erected in 1593 and 1603 respectively. With the addition of the transept, this was the first church in Malta to be given the form of a latin cross. With the crossing of the main axis of the enlarged church, and the construction of a new transept, a dome was probably erected in 1606, the date in the dome inscription. The dome is low and saucer-like in shape, and is probably one of the earliest examples still in existence in Malta. Detail of the northern semitransept of Saint Catherine's Old Church, with an inscription marking the year 1593. The main façade has a Renaissance doorway, with flanked by a set of pilasters crowned by an architrave, a cornice and a circular oculus in the masonry above. A small bell-cot, probably added later and constructed out of reused stones, rests on the gable, which straightens out on each side with a low parapet wall. Both the transept and the parapet walls are buttressed externally. The buttresses on the nave walls were added in the 19th century, and were the design of Giuseppe Hyzler. The buttress supporting the transept's walls, however, is larger and far older - giving the eastern side of the church the appearance of a fortress. In fact, the church was used as part of the defences of the Hospitaller Knights of St. John the Baptist against the Ottoman Turks. The new transept, nearly a third higher than the nave, provided commanding views of the nearby bays. High within the walls of the transept, a corridor was inserted with windows lined up on the sites of two new low lying forts, which were to be built at St. Thomas, Marsascala, and St. Lucian in Marsaxlokk. Hence, St. Catherine's old church became an intermediate military signalling point, forewarning Mdina, Cottonera and Valletta about any attack by Ottoman navy ships entering these nearby ports. = 1614 Raid = Commemorative plaque of the raid on St. Catherine's Old Church. On July 6, 1614, an Ottoman force of sixty ships (including 52 galleys) under the command of Khalil PashaE.J. Brill First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 4 page 889 tried to land at Marsaxlokk Bay, but were repelled by the artillery from the newly constructed St. Lucian Tower. The fleet laid anchor at St Thomas Bay in Marsaskala, and landed 5000 to 6000 men unopposed. Some of the Ottomans attacked St. Lucian Tower, while the rest of the force pillaged the village of Żejtun. The raiders burnt the farms and fields of the area, and damaged St. Catherine's Old Church. The attack is described in a commemorative plaque engraved close to the main altar of the church, which states that:The finding of human bones in a number of secret passages of this church was, for many years, linked with this attack. =French period= During the Maltese uprising against the French, the church was fortified and used as a hospital for wounded soldiers. = Restoration = The church was restored in 2007, with public authorities investing Lm63,000 (€146,751) in rehabilitation works. While the condition of the church was good, localised defects were found in the masonry. Preventive protection works included the replacement of crumbling stone, the clean up of the front, the removal of the cement cover on the lower parts of the façades and re-pointing to avoid water seepage. Part of the church parvis was also re- laid.  Interior description  Main altar of St. Catherine's Old Church. The interior of the church blends various architectural styles, with notes of vernacular artistry. The church has three altars. The high altar piece depicts the martyrdom of St. Catherine, and is an interesting 17th century work of art. The side altars are dedicated to Pope St. Gregory and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The latter bears the coat-of-arms of Grand Master Perellos, while the former has the arms of the city of Mdina and a Prior of Iberia, Fra. Pietro Gonzales. The painting on the main altar is not of high artistic quality, however it replaces another prestigious painting of the martyrdom of St. Catherine - now housed at the Żejtun Parish Museum - which is attributed to the Maltese painter Cassarino, in imitation of Caravaggio. This latter painting returns striking similarities with the Beheading of Saint John the Baptist and other famous paintings by Caravaggio. The titular painting rests in a stone framework, with a statue on each side. On the left, there is a statue of St. Catherine, while on the right one of St. Euphemia. These statues used to adorn the Cappella d'Italia at Saint John's Co-Cathedral, and were placed in Żejtun once they were replaced by marble statues. The northern altar at the Church, now dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, was originally dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. The northern altar, today dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, was originally dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. The old painting of this original dedication is also found in the Parish Museum, and was named by Bishop Cagliares in his pastoral visit in 1615. While the author of the current painting of Our Lady of Mount Carmel remains unknown, it was paid by Grand Master Perellos, whose coat-of-arms is included in the painting. The façade of the altar is enriched by Baroque sculpture and columns, adorned with the coat-of-arms of Grand Master Cotoner. This altar also houses a statue of St. Michael, a Spanish school wood carving, which was brought to the church in the 19th century, along with another statue of St. Joseph. The southern altar is dedicated to Pope St. Gregory, with another painting by Cassarino, following Caravaggio's methods. A Via Sagra cross, with the symbols of the Passion of Christ is also found on this side of the church. Two doorways allow access to the sacristy, which houses an impressive arched ceiling. This sacristy contains the coat-of-arms of the precentors of the Mdina Cathedral. Each precentor's years in office are marked, and his life and pastoral achievements are detailed in a short narrative. These start from the left-hand door, and keep running to the one on the right of the sacristy. These coat-of-arms are not contemporary with the two different church buildings dedicated to the St. Catherine, as the first name listed, that of precentor R. Bartholomeus Asciach, served between 1372 and 1391, centuries before the sacristy was built. = Passageways = Secret passageway, with stacked bones, in St. Catherine's Old Church. The secret passageways were found during waterproofing works on the dome. In April 1969, local newspapers reported the finding of a large number of human bones, and three secret passageways which were uncovered by workmen. Local legends always narrated the existence of secret passages within the walls of the old church, but over the years attempts to prove this proved futile. The discovery took place when three workmen, Ċikku Żammit, Carmelo Spiteri and his sixteen year old nephew Grezzju Vella were waterproofing the church's vaulted roof. Vella was working near the flat dome of the church and unwittingly began to scrape at a narrow crack between two stone slabs. When the crack widened, he threw a stone inside, expecting to hear it go down into the church. Instead it appeared to fall nearby, and Vella realised that there must be something underneath the roof. Vella called the others, and soon they were joined by Fr. Palmier, who was responsible for the church, and by Ġan- Marì Debono, who was the sacristan. On removing of a large stone slab, a dark void appeared. As only Vella could pass through the hole in the roof, he was tied to a rope and given a box of matches to inspect the site. The boy came upon a number of human skeletons, a discovery which left him deeply traumatised. Vella only returned to the church in 2011, notwithstanding that he lives only a few kilometres away. At the beginning of the third secret corridor, some engravings bearing the initials V.A. and C.Z. were found - along with the date 19.02.09. This indicated that the corridors had already been discovered prior to 1969. After the last discovery, the parish priest traced a certain Carmelo Zahra who confessed that he had entered the passages when he was a young boy together with some other individuals. He claimed that they had seen skeletons dressed as soldiers in the passages and that they had some weapons and flags with them. According to Zahra, these remains disappeared and he was warned not to mention the discovery again. The few remains that were collected during the 1969 discovery included a wooden shoe sole with a high heel, a small gilded wooden cross of Byzantine design, odd bits of a gilded wooden frame (perhaps an icon), three coins (two bronze with the cross of the Order, the other gold), pieces of pottery of the 16th and 17th centuries, fragments of animal bones and a part of a chain-mail armour vest. These remains are stored in one of the rooms of the church. No evidence exists on the provenance of the bones, or how they ended up in these secret passages. Speculation suggests that these were the bones of unfortunate victims of the 1614 Turkish raid, while others suggest the void was used as an ossuary. Between 1978 and 1980 studies on the bones indicated that the skeletons had probably been exhumed and moved there from a cemetery. Moreover, it was found that the skeletal remains belonged to individuals who had died within a short period of time.  St. Gregory's procession  Statue of St. Gregory the Great, outside the grounds of St. Catherine's Old Church. The feast of St. Gregory was one of the principal traditional feasts on the islands, involving a procession composed of confraternities from all the parishes on the islands. The origin of this feast was unknown for centuries, with the common belief that it related to a general vow by the populace on their deliverance from a great plague in 1519. Recent studies have concluded that the procession was first held in 1543 by Bishop Domenico Cubelles, in response to a papal call for prayers for peace. Originally the feast was held on March 12, the feast day of St. Gregory, and was later moved to Easter Wednesday. The procession included the respective clergy from all the islands' towns and villages, the canons of the Mdina Cathedral and the bishop, who assembled together - initially starting from Mdina, thence walking to Żejtun. On their way, the whole company joined in the litany, as pronounced by the chief priest of each confraternity. On their arrival at Żejtun, the procession visits St. Catherine's Old Church. At a particular point of the ceremony, the crowd exclaimed aloud for three times the word 'Misericordia.' The remaining part of the day was then spent in eating and feasting, and other kinds of amusements. Grand Master Perellos built a palace in Żejtun, on the main road from Tarxien, to attend the feast on the occasion of the annual procession. Grand Masters took it upon them to visit this national procession, with a large following of noblemen and grandees. A large part of St. Gregory Street in Żejtun, the main axis between the new parish church and St. Catherine's Old Church, has palaces and grand houses built as residences for this feast day. In 1926, Bishop Mauro Caruana ended the participation of other parishes after arguments erupted between the clergy of Birkirkara and Isla, on the order of precedence in the procession. Following these simplifications, the procession began at Raħal Ġdid, or Tarxien. A statue of Pope St. Gregory stands outside the church's grounds.NICPMI 1931 The statue is the work of Salvatore Dimech, based on designs by Vincenzo Hyzler. It was placed there in devotion to the annual procession held on the first Wednesday after Easter Sunday. The statue - like the original medieval chapel - looks on towards Mdina, whence the procession began.The Cult of St. Catherine of Alexandria in Malta by Mario Buhagiar.

Left to right: Karen Grude Koht, Fredrikke Marie Qvam, Gina Krog, Betzy Kjelsberg and Katti Anker Møller The Norwegian National Women's Council () was founded on 8 January 1904 as an umbrella organization for the various Norwegian women's associations. It was established by Gina Krog whose international contacts had revealed that the International Council of Women was keen to include a delegation from Norway. As a result of diminishing interest, the organization discontinued its work at the end of 1989. Background Gina Krog had been preparing an agenda for the Women's Council in the \\"Help Committee\\" (Hjelpekomité) she had run until it was dissolved in 1902. The council brought together the interests of Norway's women's associations with the expectation of the Labour Party's Women's Federation (Arbeiderpartiets kvindeforbund). One of the areas of concern was the white slave trade (now known as trafficking), which had first been raised at the Nordic Women's Day meeting in Christiania in 1902. The Central Board of Norwegian Ethics Associations (Centralstyret for De norske Sædelighetsforeninger) had also encouraged the establishment of a National Women's Council in order to bring the topic to the attention of the international community. Other areas addressed included voting rights, equal treatment in economic matters, and rights to education and jobs. Later areas of concern were maternity insurance and parliamentary representation in the Storting. The Women's Council's 25th anniversary celebrations (1929) Development As social aspects became increasingly important, in 1920 the Women's Council established the Norske Kvinners Nasjonalråd Sosialskole. Along with its affiliated institutions, the school offered the only possibility for receiving an education in social work. The Council became increasingly important for discussions on women's rights, their annual meeting often being referred to as Kvinnenes Storting or women's parliament. In the 1970s, the Women's Council begin to take on a more combative role, raising concerns in new areas of interest such as taxation, women in the armed forces and rights to financial support. In 1971, the Council was given observer status on Norway's United Nation's delegation. Success was also achieved in having more women elected to municipal government. In view of the Council's general opposition to abortion, the feminist Norwegian Association for Women's Rights (Norsk Kvinnesaksforening), which had been a member from the beginning, withdrew its support in 1972. In 1987, the housewives' organization Norges Husmorforbund also left on the grounds that the Women's Council was becoming too radical, promoting jobs for women rather than improvements to the woman's place in the home. Termination Women's organizations experienced increasing difficulties during the 1980s. As a result of general improvements in conditions for women, interest diminished. The government also began to establish bodies tasked with the protection of women's rights. When the Norwegian Women's Public Health Association (Norske Kvinners Sanitetsforening), the largest member organization, withdrew its support in 1988, it became obvious the Women's Council could no longer maintain its interests. In 1989, it was decided that the organization should close with effect from 1 January 1990.

On his last day as a Workroid operator at a shipyard in Shahal City on the planet , Hayate discovers a stowaway named Freyja Wion. Despite her crime, Hayate helps Freyja evade arrest and the two become friends. During a battle between Delta Flight and the Aerial Knights and a Vár-infected Zentradi platoon, Hayate commandeers a damaged VF-171 Nightmare Plus to fly Freyja to safety before they are shot down by the Aerial Knights and eventually saved by Mirage Farina Jenius. Following the incident, he is recruited into Delta Flight, despite his dislike for the military, out of his desire to fly and to protect those who need. While piloting his Siegfried unit, he develops a maneuver called the by Mikumo. Just like the members of Walküre, Hayate possesses \\"fold receptors\\" that not only make him immune to the Vár Syndrome, but also enhance his combat abilities when stimulated, which usually happens when his receptors synchronize with Freyja's when she sings.

Freyja's species possesses special fold capabilities, distinguished by the special antenna-like tentacle that grow from their heads but having shortened life spans in exchange, as the life expectancy of an average Windermerian is around 30 years. After going through a rigorous audition on Ragna, Freyja becomes an official member of Walküre. A distinguishing trait of Freyja is that her fold abilities usually display levels far below her capacity during rehearsals and regular concerts, only reaching their true potential in dire situations, making her the trump card of the group. When the Windermere Kingdom declares war on the New United Government, Freyja becomes briefly troubled upon suspicion from the media that she could be a Windermerian spy, and accusations of betraying her own people from the Aerial Knights. Another source of concern for her is her growing feelings for Hayate and jealous over his growing closeness to Mirage. Her catchphrase in Walküre is .

The center of the kingdom is the castle . Like humankind and the Zentradi, Windermerians are descendants of Protoculture. Compared to other races, Windermerians have a short lifespan, with an average of 30 years. After a costly war of secession against the New United Government seven years before, which ended abruptly with the detonation of a dimensional weapon of mass destruction that took millions of lives, the Kingdom secured its independence and now intends to resume hostilities in order to seize the entire Brísingr Globular Cluster. As part of their plans, Windermere remotely triggers the Vár Syndrome by projecting Heinz's song through a Protoculture shrine neighboring the Windermerian capital. Further, Vár outbreaks are amplified by the Protoculture ruins of the target planet and through consumption of Voldorian spring water combined with Windermerian apples. Due to security concerns and for propaganda purposes, Windermere severely restricts its citizens from interstellar travel. ; : :Prince of the Windermere Kingdom, he is capable of using his songs to control those infected by the Vár Syndrome, but using his powers in such way is taking a toll on his body, raising concerns regarding his health.

All of them pilot SV-262 Draken III units, colored fully in black during their covert operations against Walküre and the Delta Flight until Chancellor Roid's official declaration of war, when they reveal their default paint scheme, which is usually teal-colored with details in white. ; : :Leader of the Aerial Knights and member of the royal family, he holds the distinctive title of and views Messer as his rival until he kills him during their dogfight on Al Shahal. He is seriously injured by Hayate during combat on Ragna, losing sight on his right eye. It is revealed in Macross Delta: Kuroki Tsubasa no Shiro Kishi that Keith is Heinz's older brother, Keith's mother being one of Grammier's concubines, but as Keith got older he became distant to Heinz. Keith dies along Roid after stabbing him with his sword, stopping his plan to use Mikumo to subjugate the entire galaxy. His Sv-262 Draken is a custom unit, colored in black with details in gold. ; : :An impulsive pilot who hates humans and feels himself humiliated by Hayate since he was outmaneuvered on a battle at planet Voldor and since then vowed to kill him with his own hands.

Their specialty is combination flight in aerial combat. ; : :At the age of 33, he is the most senior of the Aerial Knights. ; : :A former Windermerian apple farmer who lost his orchard and family to the previous war with the New United Government.

Other Windermerians ; : :Herman's son. =Epsilon Foundation= is a private business conglomerate that offers their services to different clients across the galaxy, from medical supplies to military equipment. ; : :Berger is the head of Epsilon Foundation's Brísingr branch and direct contact with the Windermere Kingdom, usually reporting to Roid the progress on their analysis regarding the relics of the Protoculture. He also does business with Xaos, stating that the Windermere Kingdom is simply one of his clients. Following Xaos's failed assault on Windermere, Berger severs his ties with the Windermerians and shares his knowledge with Xaos, certain that it is more profitable for the Epsilon Foundation if the N.U.N.S. wins the war. =Others= ; : :A brown-haired native Ragnan candidate who auditioned for Walküre in 2064.

Ten Point, Tosho Boy, and Green Grass were a group of Thoroughbred horses referred to as TTG. Ten Point debuted in August 1975 as a racehorse. He gathered attention in a classic race in Kansai and was named \\"Young Youth of the Falling Star\\" due to his facial features and chestnut coat. He did not win the classic race, but he managed to win the Tenno Sho and the Arima Kinen at the age of four. His match race with Tosho Boy in the 1977 Arima Kinen race remains the most famous in horse racing history. In January 1978, Ten Point had a bone fracture in the middle of the Japanese Economy New Year Cup and died after 43 days of treatment. Ten Point won the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Colt in 1975 and the JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse in 1977. He was elected to the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame in 1990. Akira Shikato was Ten Point's jockey. Life = Before debut = Ten Point was born on April 19, 1973 on Yoshida Farm, located in Hayakita, Hokkaido. Ten Point's father was a stallion named Contrite that was in a syndicate that was exported into Japan. Ten Point's mother was named Wakakumo and was a winner in the 1966 Oka Sho race. Regarding these two horses' breeding, Yoshida Farm's Shigeo Yoshido said, \\"I don't know how making this Contrite stallion my center focus will turn out, but I've created and put him in a syndicate, so this has to succeed. To do that, I have to have a good broodmare to produce a good child horse.\\"渡辺1999、245頁。 According to Yoshido Farm's Haruo Yoshida, Ten Point was born with a form of \\"perfect quality.\\"山田1998、45頁。 Ten Point was soon bought by Hisanari Takada for ¥15,000,000 and then it was decided that he would be managed by Sasuke Ogawa in a stable at the Rittō Training Center.山田1998、40-41頁。 Before the purchase, Ogawa said that Ten Point's entire body moved like a spring when he was at Yoshido Farm.『優駿』1978年4月号、11頁。 According to people involved at Yoshido Farm, Ten Point in his early childhood was clever enough not to go against humans and was always with his mother due to his dependent nature.平岡2005、46頁。山田1998、24頁。 When Ten Point's trainer chased him in order to make him exercise, he had extraordinarily fast running speed but was burdened with a delicate body and when he was the age of two, he injured the knee bone of his foreleg.平岡2005、47頁。山田1998、42頁。 Ten Point was supplied with milk for nutrition at an early age.

He became the most backed horse for the race. Ten Point started off well and then proceeded to keep his distance from the second place horse and maintain his first-place position for the remainder of the race. He beat the 1000m record at the Hakodate Racecourse by 0.5 seconds. After this race, he was reviewed to be a suitable Japanese Classic Race contestant.山田1998、58頁。 After that race, Ogawa, his trainer, decided he would participate in two more races by the end of the year. His next race was set to be held in October, but due to excessive heat, it was moved to November. Ten Point won the race. Ten Point participated in the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. He was backed as the most popular choice for victory with a chance of over 50%. After passing the third corner, he dropped from third to sixth place without his bit and even his jockey gave up hope, but he started advancing forward at the fourth corner.

In response police defended building and a conflict started between police and terrorists which lasted for five hours. 10 policemen were killed while three were injured. Five terrorists were killed and others managed to escape. The spokesman of TTP Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility and said that the attack was carried in retaliation against Osama's killing and government's attacks against terrorists.  Background  Kulachi lies within Dera Ismail Khan, which is close to South Waziristan and other FATA regions that have hosted many military operations launched by the Pakistan Army to eliminate terrorism. Security forces are targeted in Pakistan by insurgents. This attack was also carried out against the police.  Attack  Three terrorists, two men and one woman, wearing burqas and suicide jackets, entered the police station. They threw hand grenades as they entered the police station. At around 7:26pm, one of the terrorists threw a hand grenade at the building while the others started firing indiscriminately on the policemen inside. 30–35 police men were inside the building by that time. Some terrorists had taken position on the roof of the police station and were firing at the security guards who surrounded the building. At 7:30pm two loud explosions were heard and it was not confirm whether they were suicide blasts but initial reports stated that militants were wearing suicide jackets. At 7:35pm, five minutes after the two explosions, another explosion was heard. At 7:45pm an armoured vehicle caught fire as result of explosion. An additional 150 security officials were called to take control of the area. At 7:55pm when additional security forces tried to enter the building, a terrorist threw a hand grenade on their armoured vehicle and others started firing on them. The security forces could not enter the building as terrorists took 25 policemen hostage inside the building. At 8:00pm two hostages were rescued from the crossfire. During the crossfire, the records of the police station were destroyed. At 8:20m the building caught fire due to explosions and the crossfire between the militants and security officials. During the fight, two of the three suicide bombers blew themselves up, while the third was killed by police. The suicide bombers were a couple, and police found two pairs of legs and a woman's head.  Reactions  President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack and prayed for the policemen who were killed. He also appreciated the security forces' effort.

After an investigation, the Davidson County District Attorney declined to prosecute Lippert on any charges, a decision that was protested by several groups. After reviews at several levels of the Nashville Police and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's work and reports, the U.S. Department of Justice closed the case in August 2017. Events Clemmons ran a stop sign and stopped in the parking lot of the James A. Cayce Homes. He got out of the car and was armed. His gun fell to the ground during the altercation with Lippert. Clemmons picked up the weapon before Lippert shot him, once in the abdomen, once in the hip and twice in the back as he tried to run away. On May 11, 2017, the district attorney of Davidson County, Glenn Funk, decided not to prosecute Lippert. The decision prompted criticisms from the NAACP, the ACLU and Black Lives Matter, and protesters gathered outside the residence of then Nashville Mayor Megan Barry. In August 2017, the case was closed by three federal government agencies (the United States Attorney's Office in Nashville, the FBI and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division) after they reviewed the investigations carried out by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The decision was welcomed by the Fraternal Order of Police, which prompted protesters to leave banners on interstate overpasses criticizing them on the day of their annual conference in Nashville. Parties involved =Jocques Clemmons= Jocques Clemmons was a 31-year-old man. He was raised by his mother, Sheila Clemmons Lee, and his stepfather, Mark T. Lee. He had two sisters, Aja Tate and Britta Goodner. With Tameka Lewis, he had two children, aged 13 and 8. Clemmons was arrested or given citations for driver's license violations 19 times in the past decade. Clemmons was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2014 for a cocaine conviction. By 2017, he was released on probation, and prohibited from carrying a gun. =Joshua Lippert= Joshua Lippert is a 32-year-old police officer with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. Shooting The shooting occurred minutes before 1 PM in the parking lot of the James A. Cayce Homes, a housing project in East Nashville, Tennessee. The brick buildings are home to about 2,000 residents. From his unmarked police car, Lippert saw Clemmons, who was driving a gray SUV, ran a stop sign. When Clemmons parked in the parking lot and got out of his car, he was apprehended by Lippert. Clemmons was carrying a loaded Ruger .357 Magnum gun, which fell to the ground. Lippert tried to keep Clemmons away from the gun but he picked it up and ran away between two parked vehicles; Lippert shot Clemmons once in the hip and twice in the back. Lippert picked up Clemmons' gun and put it in his own pocket. Lippert and fellow officers performed first aid on Clemmons, to no avail. Clemmons was taken to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he died from injuries during surgery. Shooting aftermath Within a few hours on February 10, the area between Sylvan Street and Summer Place on South Sixth Street was closed, and 30-odd policemen and detectives were on the scene. Meanwhile, Lippert was put on a paid administrative assignment but not suspended. Both the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation began investigations. The two entities argued over the conduct of the simultaneous investigations, with the TBI suggesting interviewing witnesses twice was problematic. The TBI also threatened to stop their investigation if the MNPD continued theirs. The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department initially said Clemmons and Lippert had two altercations. Later, video cameras showed there was only one. Clemmons' family raised $11,000 through GoFundMe for his funeral, which was held on February 18, 2017. On May 9, 2017, Lippert's attorney asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to release their investigative report to the public. On May 11, 2017, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department released a 20-page Office of Professional Accountability report of their internal investigation. They concluded that Lippert believed he was \\"in imminent danger\\" because Clemmons was carrying a gun, and that he acted in self-defense. The conclusion parallels Lippert's statement, who said he thought Clemmons was going to kill him. The same day, the district attorney of Davidson County, Glenn Funk, decided not to prosecute Lippert, concluding that Lippert had acted in self-defense. He was assisted in his decision by Marcus Floyd, the assistant district attorney general; Amy Hunter, the deputy district attorney general; Roger Moore, the deputy district attorney general; Byron Pugh, the assistant district attorney general; and Ed Ryan, assistant district attorney general. During the conference, Hunter suggested the police report included bias in favor of Lippert. In particular, the MNPD report, which was written only five hours after the shooting, called the incident a \\"justifiable homicide\\" and \\"completed.\\" Nevertheless, both Nashville Mayor Megan Barry and Mark Gwyn, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, supported DA Funk's decision not to prosecute Lippert. Shortly after the decision was made public, a news conference was held by Clemmons' family in the Nashville office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was broadcast live on television, and #jocquesclemmons began trending on Twitter. They were joined by their lawyer and a grass-roots group called Justice for Jocques Coalition. During the news conference, their lawyer said the family rejected DA Funk's decision. His sister Aja added that they wanted to get Joshua Lippert dismissed from his position at the police department. Meanwhile, protesters began chanting \\"no justice, no peace.\\" Shortly after, the chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Steve Anderson, gave another news conference, also broadcast live on television. Anderson rejected any notion of bias in their investigation. The police investigation found that Clemmons' gun had been stolen from the home of a Tennessee Department of Correction employee in Ashland City in 2001; the woman initially thought a family member had taken it. Further investigations showed that the gun was sold at a gun show in Smyrna in October 2001. On May 15, 2017, Clemmons' family declined to rule out filing a civil lawsuit against the city of Nashville. Also on May 15, police chief Anderson sent a letter to Deputy District Attorney General Amy Hunter in which he said she had misrepresented the MNPD's report; he warned, \\"Failure to properly acknowledge your error will define your integrity and is likely to attract the attention of any governing or oversight body.\\" On May 16, 2017, District Attorney Funk sent a letter to Mayor Barry responding to Anderson's contentions by saying, \\"Chief Anderson has responded to our suggestions for improving MNPD policy on terminology with personal attacks.\\" The mayor responded by calling for better communication between the MNPD and the DA's office. On May 19, 2017, Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ordered the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report to be released to the public once it had been redacted. Four days later, she said the report would be posted on the DA's website from June 9, 2017 to July 10, 2017. On May 31, 2017, Captain Harmon Hunsicker of the MNPD said they were unable to retrieve fingerprints from Clemmons's gun. In response, Clemmons's family suggested once again that they might sue the city of Nashville. In August 2017, the investigations carried out by the MNPD and the TBI were reviewed and closed by the United States Attorney's office in Nashville, the FBI and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. In early February, Clemmons's mother sued the MNPD to retrieve his phone with family pictures on it. Public response On May 12, 2017, 70-odd protesters from the Justice for Jocques Coalition and Black Lives Matter dressed in black and carrying a coffin demonstrated in Hillsboro Village, a predominantly white neighborhood. The protesters included Clemmons' family. They walked from Fannie Mae Dees Park near the campus of Vanderbilt University, up Blakemore Avenue and 24th Avenue South, all the way to the residence of Nashville mayor Megan Barry on 20th Avenue South. The protesters were also carrying signs accusing Mayor Barry of being complicit in the DA's decision. They left the coffin outside her house. On May 20, 2017, the Justice for Jocques Coalition, including Clemmons' parents, held a town hall meeting, but neither the mayor nor the DA came, and their representatives were unable to answer their questions. As for the police department, they did not respond to the invitation nor did they send anyone. A spokesperson for the coalition said, \\"We are asking to be heard because time and time again, we are dismissed, we are told that we are just a small group of loudmouths and that we'll eventually go away. [...] It does not appear to be politically expedient for them to show up and we want to show them that's not true, that we are indeed speaking for many people in the community.\\" An article published in the Nashville Scene in May 2017 suggested Funk could have charged Lippert with second-degree murder. After the investigation was closed by the US Attorney's office, the FBI and the Justice Department in August 2017, the Fraternal Order of Police \\"released a statement in support of Lippert.\\" In November 2017, Clemmons's mother visited the MNPD with community activists to ask for Lippert's dismissal; two reporters, including Steven Hale of the Nashville Scene, were escorted out of the building for trespassing by the owner. The issue of Lippert's employment was again raised by Clemmons's mother in December 2017. On February 7, 2018, an activist group called Community Oversight Now, including members of the Justice for Jocques Coalition, Black Lives Matter, Democracy Nashville, Gideon's Army, the Harriet Tubman House, and the No Exceptions Prison Collective, filed an ethics complaint with the Council Board of Ethical Conduct suggesting Mayor Barry's extramarital affair with Sergeant Robert Forrest of the MNPD may have influenced her objection to Lippert's dismissal and the establishment of a \\"citizen-led police accountability board\\" after the shooting. They also sent a letter to Vice Mayor David Briley about it. Barry denied being swayed by the incident in her decisions. The Justice for Jocques Coalition held a rally outside East Police Precinct on February 8, 2018, calling for Lippert to be let go from his job at the MNPD. On February 10, 2018, a ceremony was held in Clemmons's honor in Kirkpatrick Park. Alleged race issues The incident attracted criticism from leaders of the African-American community in Nashville. Members of the Justice for Jocques Coalition alleged the incident highlighted systemic racism in the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. The president of Nashville's NAACP chapter, Ludye Wallace, said it was \\"sad day for Nashville,\\" adding \\"It's more likely you going to get sent to jail for kicking a dog than shooting a black man down in his back while he's running.\\" Gideon's Army said they had collected data suggesting Lippert had a habit of stopping black drivers more often than white drivers. The Nashville chapter of Black Lives Matter called for Lippert's dismissal, adding \\"Today Nashville, the liberal stronghold of Tennessee, joins the other numerous localities that fail to find fault or even recognize criminality in police officers when their violence and brutality takes the lives of black people.\\" They argued that an independent community review board should be established. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Tennessee agreed that the city of Nashville should establish an independent review board, and called for Nashville police officers to wear body cameras.

Merrick School of Business is the business school at the University of Baltimore. The school operates out of the William H. Thumel Sr. Business Center, located at the corner of Charles Street and Mount Royal Avenue, across from the school of law and south of Penn Station.  History  While the university as a whole has a history of business programs dating back to its founding in 1925, it did not offer an MBA until 1972, when it began its Master in Business Administration program. The offering was followed by the Master of Science and certificate program. A merger of the university in 1973 with the Baltimore College of Commerce provided further business focus, and in 1982, the school received three large financial gifts from the Merrick Foundation. The school was then named after Robert G. Merrick, Sr.  Controversy  In the second half of 2015, the school of business ended a joint MBA program it had operated with Towson University, with UB continuing to offer standalone MBA degrees, as it had since the 1970s. The cessation came as a result of complaints from alumni of several nearby HBCUs, alleging that state funding was illegally diverted from those institutions to the UB/Towson program (Towson and UB both being traditionally white institutions). The situation came to a head in late autumn, when the amorphous HBCU alumni group put forward in court a suggestion that UB be legally required by the judge to have its brand merged into that of Morgan State University, with Morgan being the surviving institution. The merger plan was heavily criticized by legal experts, academics and students alike, with the latter group going so far as to post anonymous \\"open letters\\" on campus bulletin boards to student governments, suggesting an alternate plan in which both UB and Morgan would be merged under the brand of UMBC—an existing, non-HBCU institution with a better track record of educating successful black students than that boasted by Morgan. After these open letters of backlash—which effectively amounted to a threat to the Morgan brand—were posted, the litigious group (consisting of alumni from Morgan and other HBCUs) effectively withdrew its merger suggestion. Catherine C. Blake, the judge considering the complaint, added legal weight to the rejection of the plan in early 2016, calling the idea of a merger of UB into Morgan State \\"extreme\\" and saying that the rejected plan \\"would not be considered further.\\" The parties returned to court in early 2017 to argue over a different plan, which could see some programs transferred from historically white institutions to nearby HBCU counterparts.

White Jr. (1837 – November 11, 1902) was an American educator, intellectual, and civil rights activist. Born to a successful and influential businessman, White received the finest education afforded to African-Americans of the time and became intertwined in the dealings of Philadelphia's most prominent black leaders. The first black man in the city to be appointed as a school principal, White is recognized for his position at Roberts Vaux Consolidated School. During his tenure between 1864 and 1896, White reformed the institute and became the leading figure in the field of urban education in Philadelphia. Alongside his academic endeavors, White was significant in the sports field: he helped establish the Philadelphia Pythians, an early black baseball club. Following the shooting of his friend and fellow activist Octavius Catto in 1871, White became the top civil rights activist in the city, and remained active in the community until his death in 1902.  Biography  = Early life and career = Jacob White Jr. was born to Jacob White Sr. and Elizabeth White in 1837. His brother was George Bustill White and his sister-in-law was Emilie Davis. He was raised at 100 Old York Road in Jenkintown, a predominantly white neighborhood 10 miles (16 km) from downtown Philadelphia. According to an 1866 city directory, Jacob and George lived with their father at his home at 485 York Avenue. His father was a barber and physician who was well-respected in the black community, formerly the owner of a china shop that sold products manufactured by free negro labor, eschewing goods produced by slave labor. A savvy businessman, White Sr. enjoyed the benefits of profitable real estate investments, becoming an eminent figure in Philadelphia's exclusive inner circle of elite blacks. White Sr. engaged in several endeavors promoting education and was a long-time abolitionist; both of his passions were passed to the young White. White was initially enrolled at the Lombardy Street Public School. After completing his grammar schooling, he matriculated at the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in 1853. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers), the ICY emphasized high moral standards for its students and offered a classical study of Latin, Greek, and trigonometry. While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching on the issue of African American citizenship. The same year, White was elected secretary of the Banneker Institute, a student instructional society that convened weekly to have scholarly discussions. White was his class's lone graduate from the ICY on May 6, 1857; he earned praise for his popularity among classmates and professors alike. In 1858, he accepted a teaching position at the ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while a member of the mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy man at a young age. Long interested in an administrative role, White was the leading candidate for principal of the neglected Roberts Vaux Consolidated School. In 1864, he was appointed principal, the first black person in Philadelphia to assume such a role. Originally housed in the poorly ventilated basement of the Zoar Methodist Church, under White's leadership, the Vaux school moved to the building formerly housing the William D. Helley School and tripled in attendance. White's administration facilitated the integration of the educational system in Philadelphia, including the end of segregation at Central High School and Girls' Normal School. Satisfied with his accomplishments, White retired from the position in June 1896. = Philadelphia Pythians = Friend and fellow rights activist, Octavius Catto co-founded the Philadelphia Pythians with White. During his tenure as a teacher at the ICY, White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an important civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at the ICY, believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of the black community. On September 3, 1869, the Pythians played in the first recorded interracial baseball game. \\"Colonel\\" Thomas Fitzgerald of the Philadelphia City Item, a well-respected figure in baseball and a former owner of the Philadelphia Athletics, first proposed the idea in his newspaper to seek potential contenders. Their opponent, The Olympics, was Philadelphia's oldest ball club, having roots in the city dating back to 1832, playing town ball. Although the Pythians lost the contest 44–23, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the club \\"acquitted themselves in a very creditable manner, especially their outfielders, who made several very fine fly catches\\". White and Catto petitioned, albeit unsuccessfully, to join white athletic organizations. Denied opportunities to integrate, the Pythians nonetheless developed a friendly relationship with the Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics often shared their field with the team and chair member Hicks Hayhurst advocated for the integration of black ball clubs. The Pythians enjoyed several successful seasons but Catto's murder in 1871 signaled an end in team activities until their reformation for the 1887 season of the National Colored Base Ball League. = Other endeavors = Following Catto's death, White became \\"the preeminent statesmen for Philadelphia’s African-American community\\", according to the Falvey Memorial Library. His memberships included the National Equal Rights League, Pennsylvania Abolition Society, and the Social, Civil, and Statistical Association of Pennsylvania, contributing as a secretary. The death of Catto, however, presaged the move of the Equal Rights Society headquarters a year later; consequently, White's interests in civil rights organizations waned. In 1849, White founded Lebanon Cemetery, one of only two cemeteries for the burial of African Americans in Philadelphia at the time. By 1889, the cemetery was overcrowded and in disrepair. A sensational trial took place after a journalist caught grave robbers from the Jefferson Medical College stealing corpses for use as cadavers by medical students. The city condemned the cemetery and relocated the bodies to Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania. In June 1895, at an organizational meeting White was appointed the president of the board for the Douglass Memorial Hospital. Under his direction, he appropriated state funds for the hospital in 1898 from Alexander K. Pedrick of the State Senate. Having succeeded in procuring the funds, White resigned from his position but maintained a seat on the board until his death on November 11, 1902.

Following her illegal emigration, all her recordings were deleted from the Romanian Radio and Television phonoteque, and her name no longer appeared in any publication – not even in the monograph on Silvia Șerbescu by Iosif Sava and Florian Șerbescu. She worked for 22 years as a piano teacher at the \\"Brabants Conservatorium\\" of the Tilburg Katholieke Leergangen University.

In addition, she edited in collaboration with Barbara Heller the first publication of those works (Furore Verlag, 1989). Another significant contribution to the piano repertoire was Liana Șerbescu's discovery of Ethel Smyth's piano music at the British Library Manuscripts Department, that she subsequently recorded on a double CD by CPO (1995) and edited at the prestigious publishers Breitkopf & Härtel (2001–2002) In 1980 she performed at the Bonn First International Festival of Women Composers Clara Schumann’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra with the French conductor Claire Gibault. Subsequently, she often performed in Germany and the Netherlands with the Köln \\"Clara Schumann\\" Women's Orchestra led by . After the 1989 Romanian revolution she resumed playing in Romania. The composer Boldizsár Csiky greeted her return with the words: \\"After 18 years of absence, together we cheer: Welcome home!\\"Boldizsár Csiky, in program notes to the Târgu Mureș Symphony Concert of March 5, 1993: \\"Glory of Romanian musical interpretation in the sixties, Liana Șerbescu followed the brilliant career of her mother, Silvia Serbescu...

Liana Șerbescu was married from 1965 to 1998 to the theoretical physicist Mihai Gavrilă, with whom she has two children: Ioa-Silva Gavrilă and Dariu Mihai Gavrilă.

She also premiered in several countries piano works by Romanian composers and recorded them for radio broadcasts. In 1976 she premiered in Osnabruck 's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. Music by women composers, spanning four centuries, had a special and consistent place in her repertoire. She played Clara Schumann’s Piano Concerto with several orchestras, as well as solo pieces by various women composers, some of which were dedicated to her.Here are some of the piano pieces dedicated to Liana Șerbescu: *Joanna Bruzdowicz: Sonate d’Octobre pour piano, Tonos – International Editions GmbH, Darmstadt, 1981.

RMM had been initially developed as a series of extensions to the original inverse Box–Cox transformation:y={{(1+\\\\lambda z)}^{1/\\\\lambda }}, where y is a percentile of the modeled response, Y (the modeled random variable), z is the respective percentile of a normal variate and λ is the Box–Cox parameter. As λ goes to zero, the inverse Box–Cox transformation becomes: y=e^z, an exponential model. Therefore, the original inverse Box-Cox transformation contains a trio of models: linear (λ = 1), power (λ ≠ 1, λ ≠ 0) and exponential (λ = 0). This implies that on estimating λ, using sample data, the final model is not determined in advance (prior to estimation) but rather as a result of estimating. In other words, data alone determine the final model. Extensions to the inverse Box–Cox transformation were developed by Shore (2001a) and were denoted Inverse Normalizing Transformations (INTs). They had been applied to model monotone convex relationships in various engineering areas, mostly to model physical properties of chemical compounds (Shore et al., 2001a, and references therein). Once it had been realized that INT models may be perceived as special cases of a much broader general approach for modeling non-linear monotone convex relationships, the new Response Modeling Methodology had been initiated and developed (Shore, 2005a, 2011 and references therein). The RMM model expresses the relationship between a response, Y (the modeled random variable), and two components that deliver variation to Y: * The linear predictor, LP (denoted η):\\\\eta =\\\\beta_0 +\\\\beta_1 X_1+ \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_k X_k, where {X1,...,Xk} are regressor-variables (“affecting factors”) that deliver systematic variation to the response; * Normal errors, delivering random variation to the response. The basic RMM model describes Y in terms of the LP, two possibly correlated zero-mean normal errors, ε1 and ε2 (with correlation ρ and standard deviations σε1 and σε2, respectively) and a vector of parameters {α,λ,μ} (Shore, 2005a, 2011): : W=\\\\log (Y)=\\\\mu + \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\alpha \\\\lambda \\\\right) [(\\\\eta + \\\\varepsilon_1)^\\\\lambda-1] + \\\\varepsilon_2,\\\\, and ε1 represents uncertainty (measurement imprecision or otherwise) in the explanatory variables (included in the LP). This is in addition to uncertainty associated with the response (ε2). Expressing ε1 and ε2 in terms of standard normal variates, Z1 and Z2, respectively, having correlation ρ, and conditioning Z2  Z1 = z1 (Z2 given that Z1 is equal to a given value z1), we may write in terms of a single error, ε: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\varepsilon_1 & = \\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon_1} Z_1\\\\,\\\\,;\\\\,\\\\,\\\\varepsilon_2 = \\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon_2} Z_2; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\varepsilon_2 & = \\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon_2} \\\\rho z_1 + (1-\\\\rho^2)^{(1/2)}\\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon_2} Z = dz_1 + \\\\varepsilon, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where Z is a standard normal variate, independent of both Z1 and Z2, ε is a zero-mean error and d is a parameter. From these relationships, the associated RMM quantile function is (Shore, 2011): w=\\\\log (y)=\\\\mu +\\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\alpha \\\\lambda \\\\right)[(\\\\eta +cz)^\\\\lambda-1]+(d)z+\\\\varepsilon, or, after re-parameterization: : w=\\\\log (y)=\\\\log (M_Y)+\\\\left( \\\\frac{a\\\\eta^b} b \\\\right)\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ 1+\\\\left( \\\\frac c \\\\eta \\\\right) z \\\\right]^b - 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} + (d)z+\\\\varepsilon , where y is the percentile of the response (Y), z is the respective standard normal percentile, ε is the model’s zero-mean normal error with constant variance, σ, {a,b,c,d} are parameters and MY is the response median (z = 0), dependent on values of the parameters and the value of the LP, η: : \\\\log (M_Y)=\\\\mu +\\\\left( \\\\frac a b \\\\right) [\\\\eta^b-1]=\\\\log (m)+\\\\left( \\\\frac a b \\\\right)[\\\\eta^b-1], where μ (or m) is an additional parameter. If it may be assumed that cz<<η, the above model for RMM quantile function can be approximated by: : w=\\\\log (y)=\\\\log (M_Y)+\\\\left( \\\\frac{a\\\\eta^b} b \\\\right) \\\\left[\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{bcz} \\\\eta \\\\right)-1\\\\right]+(d)z+\\\\varepsilon . The parameter “c” cannot be “absorbed” into the parameters of the LP (η) since “c” and LP are estimated in two separate stages (as expounded below). If the response data used to estimate the model contain values that change sign, or if the lowest response value is far from zero (for example, when data are left-truncated), a location parameter, L, may be added to the response so that the expressions for the quantile function and for the median become, respectively: : w=\\\\log (y-L)=\\\\log (M_Y-L)+\\\\left( \\\\frac{a\\\\eta^b} b \\\\right)\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ 1+\\\\left( \\\\frac c \\\\eta \\\\right)z \\\\right]^b -1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}+(d)z+\\\\varepsilon \\\\,; : \\\\log (M_Y-L)=\\\\mu +\\\\left( \\\\frac a b \\\\right)[\\\\eta^b-1].  Major property of RMM – continuous monotonic convexity (CMC)  As shown earlier, the inverse Box–Cox transformation depends on a single parameter, λ, which determines the final form of the model (whether linear, power or exponential). All three models thus constitute mere points on a continuous spectrum of monotonic convexity, spanned by λ. This property, where different known models become mere points on a continuous spectrum, spanned by the model’s parameters, is denoted the Continuous Monotonic Convexity (CMC) property. The latter characterizes all RMM models, and it allows the basic “linear-power-exponential” cycle (underlying the inverse Box–Cox transformation) to be repeated ad infinitum, allowing for ever more convex models to be derived. Examples for such models are an exponential-power model or an exponential-exponential-power model (see explicit models expounded further on). Since the final form of the model is determined by the values of RMM parameters, this implies that the data, used to estimate the parameters, determine the final form of the estimated RMM model (as with the Box–Cox inverse transformation). The CMC property thus grant RMM models high flexibility in accommodating the data used to estimate the parameters. References given below display published results of comparisons between RMM models and existing models. These comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the CMC property.  Examples of RMM models  Ignoring RMM errors (ignore the terms cz, dz, and e in the percentile model), we obtain the following RMM models, presented in an increasing order of monotone convexity: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\text{linear: } y = \\\\eta & & (\\\\alpha = 1, \\\\lambda=0); \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & \\\\text{power: } y = \\\\eta^\\\\alpha, & & (\\\\alpha e1, \\\\lambda=0); \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & \\\\text{exponential-linear: } y = k \\\\exp(\\\\eta), & & (\\\\alpha e1,\\\\lambda=1); \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & \\\\text{exponential-power: } y=k\\\\exp (\\\\eta^\\\\lambda), & & (\\\\alpha e 1, \\\\lambda e 1; k \\\\text{ is a non-negative parameter}.) \\\\end{align} Adding two new parameters by introducing for η (in the percentile model): \\\\exp \\\\left[\\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\beta \\\\kappa \\\\right) (\\\\eta^\\\\kappa-1)\\\\right], a new cycle of “linear-power-exponential” is iterated to produce models with stronger monotone convexity (Shore, 2005a, 2011, 2012): : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\text{exponential-power: } y = k \\\\exp (\\\\eta^\\\\lambda), & & (\\\\alpha eq, \\\\lambda e1, \\\\beta=1, \\\\kappa =0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & \\\\text{ restoring the former model}); \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\text{exponential-exponential-linear: } y = k_1 \\\\exp [k_2\\\\exp (\\\\eta)], & & (\\\\alpha e1, \\\\lambda e1, \\\\beta=1, \\\\kappa=1); \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\text{exponential-exponential-power: } y = k_1 \\\\exp [k_2\\\\exp (\\\\eta^\\\\kappa)], & & (\\\\alpha e1, \\\\lambda e1, \\\\beta=1, \\\\kappa e 1). \\\\end{align} It is realized that this series of monotonic convex models, presented as they appear in a hierarchical order on the “Ladder of Monotonic Convex Functions” (Shore, 2011), is unlimited from above. However, all models are mere points on a continuous spectrum, spanned by RMM parameters.  Moments  The k-th non-central moment of Y is (assuming L = 0; Shore, 2005a, 2011): : \\\\operatorname{E}(Y^k) = (M_Y)^k \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{k\\\\alpha} \\\\lambda \\\\right) [(\\\\eta +cZ)^\\\\lambda - 1] + (kd)Z \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Expanding Yk, as given on the right-hand-side, into a Taylor series around zero, in terms of powers of Z (the standard normal variate), and then taking expectation on both sides, assuming that cZ ≪ η so that η + cZ ≈ η, an approximate simple expression for the k-th non-central moment, based on the first six terms in the expansion, is: : \\\\operatorname{E} (Y)^k \\\\cong (M_Y)^k e^{\\\\alpha k \\\\left( \\\\eta^\\\\lambda-1 \\\\right)/\\\\lambda} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1+\\\\frac 1 2 (kd)^2 + \\\\frac 1 8 (kd)^4 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. An analogous expression may be derived without assuming cZ ≪ η. This would result in a more accurate (however lengthy and cumbersome) expression. Once cZ in the above expression is neglected, Y becomes a log-normal random variable (with parameters that depend on η).  RMM fitting and estimation  RMM models may be used to model random variation (as a general platform for distribution fitting) or to model systematic variation (analogously to generalized linear models, GLM). In the former case (no systematic variation, namely, η = constant), RMM quantile function is fitted to known distributions. If the underlying distribution is unknown, the RMM quantile function is estimated using available sample data. Modeling random variation with RMM is addressed and demonstrated in Shore (2011 and references therein). In the latter case (modeling systematic variation), RMM models are estimated assuming that variation in the linear predictor (generated via variation in the regressor- variables) contribute to the overall variation of the modeled response variable (Y). This case is addressed and demonstrated in Shore (2005a, 2012 and relevant references therein). Estimation is conducted in two stages. First the median is estimated by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (of fitted model from sample data points). In the second stage, the remaining two parameters (not estimated in the first stage, namely, {c,d}), are estimated. Three estimation approaches are presented in Shore (2012): maximum likelihood, moment matching and nonlinear quantile regression.  Literature review  Current RMM literature addresses three areas: (1) Developing INTs and later the RMM approach, with allied estimation methods; (2) Exploring the properties of RMM and comparing RMM effectiveness to other current modelling approaches (for distribution fitting or for modelling systematic variation); (3) Applications. Shore (2003a) developed Inverse Normalizing Transformations (INTs) in the first years of the 21st century and has applied them to various engineering disciplines like statistical process control (Shore, 2000a, b, 2001a, b, 2002a) and chemical engineering (Shore at al., 2002). Subsequently, as the new Response Modeling Methodology (RMM) had been emerging and developing into a full-fledged platform for modeling monotone convex relationships (ultimately presented in a book, Shore, 2005a), RMM properties were explored (Shore, 2002b, 2004a, b, 2008a, 2011), estimation procedures developed (Shore, 2005a, b, 2012) and the new modeling methodology compared to other approaches, for modeling random variation (Shore 2005c, 2007, 2010; Shore and A’wad 2010), and for modeling systematic variation (Shore, 2008b). Concurrently, RMM had been applied to various scientific and engineering disciplines and compared to current models and modeling approaches practiced therein. For example, chemical engineering (Shore, 2003b; Benson-Karhi et al., 2007; Shacham et al., 2008; Shore and Benson-Karhi, 2010), statistical process control (Shore, 2014; Shore et al., 2014; Danoch and Shore, 2016), reliability engineering (Shore, 2004c; Ladany and Shore, 2007), forecasting (Shore and Benson-Karhi, 2007), ecology (Shore, 2014), and the medical profession (Shore et al., 2014; Benson-Karhi et al., 2017).

As a woman in a man's world she achieved a number of \\"firsts\\". She was the first woman to be employed as a school doctor in Bern. She was a feminist activist, although it was as much her lifestyle choices as her conscious activism that are remembered. In a traditionalist city in the conservative heart of Switzerland, Ida Hoff was one of Bern's first regular female motorists.  Life  = Family provenance and early years = Adelaide \\"Ida\\" Hoff was born in Moscow. Her father, Siegfried Hoff (ca.1845-1896), had been born into a prosperous German Jewish family, and had emigrated to the United States, taking US citizenship. According to one source, Siegfried Hoff was regarded by family members as the \\"black sheep\\" of the family. At some stage he had trained as a dentist. However, he had left the United States and, from the perspective of his respectable brother Leopold who lived near Hamburg and ran the family manufacturing business, Siegfried had \\"disappeared\\" into czarist Russia where he supported himself as a businessman. The family business had been established by Ida's grandfather, Johann Hoff, and involved manufacturing a Malt Extract health tonic which sold well in the German speaking world. It also sold well in Russia, where \\"Hoff's Elixir\\" even got a mention in the novel \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–1881). As a child Ida Hoff grew up in circumstances of some material comfort, possibly reflecting her father's success as a health tonic salesman. Anna Naschatir (1861–1901) was the \\"impoverished cousin\\" of Siegfried Hoff's landlord. She had been born in Daugavpils which today is in Latvia but at that time would have been regarded as a prosperous city to the south of St. Petersburg in the western part of the Russian empire. Anna was at least sixteen years younger than Siegfried. It is not clear whether they married out of love or from dynastic calculations. The marriage ceremony, conducted towards the end of 1878 in St. Petersburg, was a lavish affair. The couple's only child, Adelaide \\"Ida\\" Hoff, was born a little over a year later. However, the marriage was a joyless one. Anna and Siegfried separated in the mid 1880s, although they were formally divorced only in 1890. It was possibly a reflection of the stigma surrounding divorce that later Ida would explain that she had grown up in a one-parent family in the context of her father's early death, which was not completely untrue. (Her father died in 1896.) Despite being a one parent family, it appears that the divorce settlement left Anna and her daughter well provided for financially. = Escape to Switzerland = Before Ida reached school age, in 1886 Anna, still not quite 25, moved with her daughter to Switzerland, Hundreds of other young Russian women were making the same journey at this time, especially those from an intellectual milieu or with a record of political awareness. The czarist regime in Russia was becoming increasingly despotic and paranoid, persecuting opponents where it identified them, placing Jews under pressure and blocking the way to higher education for women. Many of the young women fleeing Russia settled in the Zürich districts Fluntern and Hottingen, on the city's eastern side. Anna Hoff was one of these, although unlike most of them she had very little interest in politics or in fermenting revolution in Russia: the focus of her life was more on her own personal development and on looking after her little daughter. The woman running the guest house in which they lived described her - with evident approval - as an educated, quiet and reliable person (\\"[eine] gebildete, stille und solide Person\\"). Despite the landlady's evaluation, Anna's school education had been relatively basic, and not sufficient as a basis for enrolling as a university student. She was able to listen to lectures as an \\"Auskultantin\\", She attended philosophy lectures given by Ludwig Stein. Anna was determined that her daughter's path to serious study should not be blocked in the way hers had been. = Citizenship for Anna: Bereavement and Education for Ida = During the final days of 1892 Anna Hoff and her daughter moved to Bern. It is not clear whether the move from Zürich to Bern had anything to do with Ludwig Stein's move to the University of Bern which took place at about the same time. Stein, like the Hoffs, was of Jewish provenance and he was also, according to at least one source, a dazzling figure. He lived in high bourgeois style in a city villa where guests were always welcome. He was supportive of his friends, but in academic circles he was controversial, and in 1909 he would be forced to give up his teaching chair at the university, after which he moved to Berlin. While Ida was growing up her mother was a frequent visitor to Stein's Bern villa. When, in 1896/97, Anna applied for Swiss citizenship for a second time, Stein went out of his way to champion her application. On the occasion of her first application, in 1893, the city authorities had accepted that she was not involved in politics, but had nevertheless determined that having lived in Switzerland for six years was insufficient to justify citizenship. It was not till 1897, after news came through that her ex-husband had died the previous year, that the authorities gave Anna Hoff the green light for naturalisation. For reasons that remain unclear it was now Anna who did not pursue the matter, however. Anna Hoff was by now increasingly affected by chronic kidney disease. In 1901 she visited Küssnacht in search of a cure. It was here, in October 1901, that Anna Hoff died, aged around 40Death announcement in: Der Bund, 12 October 1901. The burial had already taken place on 11 October. The «Villa Clara» at Grepperstrasse 22 was run by Dr. med. Josef Vonmoos as a healing and care establishment, especially for nervous illnesses. The cause of death reported by Vermoos in the local death registry was «Nephritis chronica». in the guest house \\"Villa Clara\\" where she was staying. Ida was greatly affected by her mother's death, and it is clear that the mother:daughter bond between them had been exceptionally close. Landlocked Switzerland was unusual in western Europe with regard to the vanishingly low levels of naturally occurring iodine in the national diet, a deficiency that has subsequently been addressed by adding iodine to salt sold in the shops. Later, in a medical dissertation, Ida Hoff addressed issues involved in kidney disease in a piece of work entitled \\"On the question of salt retention in kidney disease\\" (\\"Über die Frage der Kochsalzretention bei Nephritis [...]\\"). As a school student Ida Hoff was already actively concerned with women's rights. Activism was not the only thing that marked her out from fellow students. She attended a Gymnasium (school with an academic focus) in Bern. It had only been in 1894 that public secondary schools in Bern had started to accept female students. By the time she passed her Matura (school final exams) in 1899 Ida Hoff was one of just two girls in her class at the Bern Literary Gymnasium (\\"Berner Literatur- Gymnasium'\\"). The other one, Clara Winnicki (later Clara Herbrand), also achieved subsequent feminist notability as the first qualified female pharmacist in Switzerland with her own business. = Student years and activism = Hoff enrolled as a medical student at the University of Bern in 1899. She would flourish at university where, again, she was something of a pioneer. There were indeed plenty of Russian female students studying at western universities. That reflected the all-male nature of universities in Russia. But most of the Russians stayed Russian, spending their spare time with fellow Russians. Ida Hoff was evidently keen from the outset to become assimilated in Swiss society. In order to avoid becoming isolated, she was one of a group of Bern students who founded the \\"Bern Female Students' Association\\" (\\"Berner Studentinnenverein\\"). The female students conducted themselves with some confidence, participating as a group in the opening ceremony in 1903 of a new college building in the city's Grosse Schanze quarter which they made memorable by turning up carrying the slogan \\"Equal rights - Equal obligations\\" (\\"gleiche Rechte – gleiche Pflichten\\"). Subsequently, they defended themselves against sexist attacks. Within the group Hoff found like minded contemporaries several of whom became firm lifelong friends. One of these was the international peace activist and (later) professor of biochemistry, Gertrud Woker (1878 - 1968). Another was the mathematician Annie Reineck (later Annie Leuch-Reineck 1880 - 1978) who became the longstanding president of the Swiss league for Women's Voting Rights. The chronicler of the Swiss feminist movement, Agnes Vogel (later Agnes Debrit-Vogel 1892 - 1974), also earned her activist spurs as a member of the \\"Bern Female Students' Association\\". For Ida Hoff's future life and professional career, more important, probably, than any of these was Frida Kaiser (later Frida Imboden-Kaiser 1877 - 1962), a forceful contemporary who later became a pediatrician at St. Gallen and a successful campaigner against needlessly high levels of infant mortality. The two of them first met at the \\"Aebischlössli\\" student hostel. Kaiser helped Hoff find a job as an assistant at the medical Uni-Clinic with the leading intermist, Hermann Sahli. It was also Kaiser who found Hoff a lawyer who advised and backed her in a renewed - and this time successful - application for Swiss citizenship. The small but determined group of female students used to meet together each Saturday at the homely \\"Daheim Women's Restaurant\\" in Bern's Zeughausgasse (literally: \\"Armoury Alley\\") to analyse and bemoan examples of anti-feminism. They also organised lectures, readings and stage events. Hoff herself was never short of imaginative ideas, and helped with production of their association news-sheet. The \\"Bern Female Students' Association\\" became a crucible for the Women's Voting Rights movement. To Hoff it never made sense that women in Switzerland should be able to participate in the workplace, the professions, society and family life, but not in politics. She also recognised that her own education was a privilege, and one that she owed to the women's movement, and this provided an impetus behind several years of intense participation in the executive committee of the \\"Bern Women's Voting Rights Association\\" (\\"Frauenstimmrechtsverein Bern\\"). But she also campaigned on other social and political issues. She called for the introduction of universal old age and disability insurance (which was finally introduced following a referendum in 1947) and involved herself in the 1933 \\"Women and Democracy\\" movement which campaigned for the preservation of democracy in the face of the rising tide of right wing populism which was a feature of the times. = Junior doctor: Senior doctor = Ida Hoff passed her national qualifying exams in Summer 1905 and arranged to move to Berlin in order to obtain experience as a medical assistant at the Moabit Hospital there. It was also in Berlin, at the Women's Clinic of the Charité teaching hospital, that she worked on her dissertation \\"Beitrag zur Histologie der Schwangerschaft im rudimentären Nebenhorn\\", a gynaecological study on an aspect of pregnancy: this earned her a doctorate from Bern in 1906. Her doctorate was supervised by the pathologist Theodor Langhans. Following her return to Bern, even her friends found it sensational that Hoff, as a woman, was able to win the confidence of the great internist, Hermann Sahli, who in 1911 appointed her his senior assistant and then as a senior doctor. As matters turned out, her career with the Uni-Clinic was a brief one. Her appointment at the Sahli's medical Uni-Clinic nevertheless represented a double breakthrough. She was both female and Jewish. Hoff did not engage in Jewish religious practices, but she made no attempt to hide her Jewish provenance and stood out uncompromisingly in opposition to any antisemitic manifestations that she encountered. = Self employed medical practitioner = In April 1911 the cantonal authorities granted her a license to open her own medical surgery. Soon after this she left her employment and her \\"service apartment\\" at the medical Uni-Clinic and moved into her own premises in the Marktgasse (\\"Market Street\\") where she opened a medical practice for internal medicine. A year later she moved to larger premises in the Amthausgasse (literally:Office-building Street). Both were centrally located in the heart of the old city. Hoff moved into self employment with some misgivings. At that time, in the whole of Bern, there were just four female doctors working in general practice, compared to 128 male colleagues. Her doubts proved unfounded, however, and she very quickly found she had plenty of patients. She inspired confidence with her sound, always up to date medical knowledge, a strong sense of responsibility, a certain imperturbable calmness of approach and a powerful determination to do good. Her diagnoses were almost always correct; and she communicated them with honesty, clarity, and appropriate sensitivity. In September 1913 she was able to present herself as Bern's first female in the directors office of the city's principal secondary school for girls. The occasion was given added piquancy by the fact that it was in this same school director's office that, as a child she had been reprimanded twenty years earlier on account of her \\"excessively high spirited conduct\\". Once regular medical checkups had been established as a feature of school life, equivalent controls were introduced for other schools in Bern. Over the next 32 years Ida Hoff developed the service, inoculating hundreds of girls and providing to parents, every spring, reports about their daughters' physical development, although she tended to not refer to these aspects of her work in public speeches. Her programme for the children included gymnastics, prophylaxis and hygiene, metaphorically \\"removing the stockings from the dirty feet and legs\\". Reflecting the endemic medical problems of the time and place, she was involved in struggles against several major epidemics of tuberculosis, flu and scarlet fever. Hoff was also centrally involved in the Swiss move to cut down Thyroide (\\"Kropf\\") disease. A driving force behind this campaign was the medical professor Fritz de Quervain (1868-1940). In 1923 de Quervain asserted that the Swiss people, so richly over endowed with goitres, should be able to look forward to a golden age unencumbered by these swellings. He noticed that goitre was rare among the children in the Jura region where the public water supply included naturally occurring iodine, and there was also iodine in locally sourced table salt and milk. There was virtually no naturally occurring iodine in the Bern diet, however. Researchers at the time determined that there was very likely to be a connection between the absence of dietary iodine and thyroid disease in Bern. As a schools doctor Hoff engaged in the campaign. Girls were given special sweets/candies containing iodine, flavoured and bulked out with fortifying malt extract. Although the formulation for the tablets may have been connected with the Hamburg-based Hoff family business, the special \\"Majowa\\" sweets provided to school children in Bern were produced in Bern by Wander AG the at the Ovalmaltine factory. The campaign was a great success. After seven years the number of children with goitre induced by Iodine deficiency was down from 60% to 10%. Ida Hoff produced tables illustrating the highly successful campaign against goitre. These were exhibited in 1928 at the first ever SAFFA (Schweizeische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit \\"Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work\\"). The exhibition attracted ten times more visitors than had been anticipated and took in ten million francs. The delighted all-female organising team, having captured popular attention, also dragged a giant model of a snail round Bern in order to illustrate the speed with which their campaign for women to have the chance to vote was progressing. Hoff enjoyed her part in the event. She also involved herself in the accompanying programme of publicity. Her work as a school doctor was celebrated in a frieze produced by Hannah Egger (1881 - 1965) for the \\"[female] School doctor room\\" at the SAFFA (exhibition). Not withstanding her other activities, it was her work as a school doctor that most defined Hoff's work, and the necessary intensity of this work was redoubled during the early 1940s because of the need to recruit and train up additional female colleagues to make of for male colleagues whose medical skills had been redeployed to war related work caused by the international war in which all the states surrounding Switzerland (other than Liechtenstein) had directly involved themselves. In May 1945 the war in Europe ended, however, and Hoff, who had celebrated her sixty-fifth birthday a few months earlier, retired from her work as a schools doctor. =Anna Tumarkin: friend and partner= Anna Tumarkin (1875-1951) became a distinguished Swiss philosopher. Tumarkin had been born in Dubrowna in the Russian empire, but had ended up in Bern where her brilliant academic career included a number of \\"firsts\\". She was the first woman at Bern university - and only the third in Switzerland - to obtain a Habilitation (higher academic qualification). The two women also had their Jewish provenance in common. Tumarkin was five years older than Hoff, and had originally been an acquaintance of Ida's mother, Anna Hoff. The two Annas - the \\"Auskultantin\\" Anna Hoff and the enrolled student Anna Tumarkin - met up in the welcoming ambience of the open house kept by the philosophy lecturer Ludwig Stein, and during the 1890s they took to sitting together in lectures at the university. More than a decade after her mother's death, and more than one year after establishing herself as a self-employed medical practitioner, Ida Hoff moved to larger premises in the Amthausgasse in the heart of the old city. With space to spare, she persuaded Anna Tumarkin to move in. Tumarkin had already attracted attention as Bern's first female professor. What began as a practical house sharing arrangement blossomed into a lifelong partnership between the two women. In Spring 1921 they moved together into a new home in the Hallwylstrasse, a few buildings along the street from the (subsequently much enlarged) Swiss National Library. They filled their home \\"with beautiful old furniture\\" and set aside a room as their own library, containing \\"much sought after books\\". In 1925, for the first time, Hoff and Tumarkin together visited Tumarkin's family in Chișinău, which at that time was in Romania. In character and temperament Hoff and Tumarkin were completely different. Hoff was a forceful and practical character who faced the world with determination, warm cheerfulness, and \\"eyes wide open\\". Tumarkin had an \\"other worldly\\" aspect: she was more focused on abstract thought, and instinctively sought to bring every question back to basic principals. Hoff was able to sensitize her friend to the practical need for women to be given the vote, so that Tumarkin became a supporter, and indeed helped to compile a catalogue of women's literature for the SAFFA (exhibition). Doctor Hoff hugely admired the philosopher's scholarship, frequent flashes of intellectual brilliance and endless curiosity driven academic research. Professor Tumarkin appreciated the security provided by the doctor's boundless capacity for nurture. There is no compelling evidence for or against the inevitable mutterings that the two became lesbian lovers. On the subject of marriage, in a discussion that apparently referenced her own intensively lived life, Ida Hoff on one occasion remarked, \\"With a man, I really never would know where I should start.\\" (\\"Ich wüsste wirklich nicht, was ich noch mit einem Mann anfangen sollte!\\"). Friends concluded that she had never felt the need to marry because her work absorbed all her capacities for \\"limitless devotion\\" and \\"true self sacrifice\\". It is certainly true that she sometimes deferred her scheduled holidays because she needed to look after her sick patients. =Automobiliste and tourist= Hoff and Tumarkin were lovers of nature and of the arts. This was part of what pushed Hoff into becoming one of Bern's first female car owners and also one of the first doctors in the city who learned to visit her patients' homes by car without a chauffeur. Bern's license plates for motor vehicles began with the number \\"1000\\": Hoff's car carried the license plate \\"2151\\". While she was learning to drive she had a recurring nightmare involving children who had been run over. She therefore drove her car elegantly but with extreme care through the city streets. When they had free time the two women liked to drive in the mountain road network being constructed in the countryside towards Interlaken to the east and the Lake of Geneva to the south. Hoff had at one stage wanted to study Biology, and was enthusiastic about the natural splendours of the mountain roads, alongside which \\"no flower could hide in the undergrowth\\". On Sundays the women also liked to visit culturally important towns, country churches and interesting local museums. Another member of the expeditions, sometimes, was the local artist Rudolf Münger (1862-1929). Münger had been persuaded by his sister-in-law, Luise \\"Lysi\\" Münger Leder to paint a portrait of Ida Hoff in 1923. With his wife, Heidi, he liked to accompany Hoff and Tumarkin on their Sunday afternoon drives to favourite walking locations such as the Schwarzsee and nearby Fribourg. Münger recorded in a diary his enthusiastic or critical impressions of art works or natural features encountered during these afternoon excursions.Burgerbibliothek Bern, Nachlass Rudolf Münger, 13 (1), Tagebücher, 17 (1/2) Korrespondenz. The cultural highlight of Hoff's and Tumarkin's shared travel experiences took them beyond the surrounding cantons, however, and involved a visit to Greece in the spring of 1927 which they undertook with a travel company called, appropriately, the \\"Hellasgesellschaft\\". Tumarkin recorded her impressions in a \\"travel book\\" and contributed a lengthy reportage to \\"Der kleine Bund\\".Tumarkin, Anna: Eindrücke der Hellasreise 1927. In: «Hellas», Schweiz. Vereinigung der Freunde Griechenlands, Sektion Bern (Hg.): Hellasfahrt. Ein Reisebuch. Zürich, 1928. Sd.in der StUB; Der kleine Bund, 19.6.1927. =Sharing the suffering: family= Hoff and Tumarkin were both Jewish, with relatives in parts of Europe that were badly affected by the Shoah. In 1925 and 1937, the friends made two lengthy visits to Tumarkin's relatives in Chișinău, then a part of Greater Romania, today in Moldova. The city had been the scene of ferocious antisemitic pogroms at the start of the twentieth century, and the coming to power in Germany of the Hitler government paved the way for race based persecution and slaughter in the 1940s as the German and Soviet armies fought for control over the Bessarabia region. Many of Tumarkin's family were horribly persecuted, deported, and in some cases killed. While Ida's father, Siegfried Hoff (ca. 1845-1896) had emigrated, first to the United States and later to the Russian empire, his elder brother Leopold Hoff had remained in Hamburg and managed the family firm. In 1905, newly qualified, Ida Hoff had traveled to Berlin to gain medical experience. She had taken an indirect route, traveling via Hamburg to visit her Uncle Leopold's family. On that occasion she had made a deep impression on her cousin Clara, both on account of her \\"unconventional lifestyle\\" and because of the surgical skill with which she dissected a roast chicken. The cousins remained in touch, and in the summer of 1936 Cousin Clara, who had not yet been deprived of her German passport by the Nazis, but nevertheless by this stage had relocated to the Netherlands, visited Ida and her friend Anna. By this time Clara Carstens-Hoff had a teenage daughter of her own, Li Carstens, who accompanied her mother on the family visit to Switzerland. Li, like her mother 21 years earlier, was deeply impressed by Ida.Li Carstens, quoted by Franziska Rogger. Cousin Clara and her daughter survived the Hitler years. Other relatives, friends and acquaintances were killed. Hoff and Tumarkin were badly affected by the gruesome fate of relatives. As their friend and confidant Georgine Gerhard recalled after Hoff's death, \\"that such horrors could be inflicted on the Jews without a storm of indignation bursting out across the entire world weighed on them heavily. Ida was also deeply unsettled by the less than laudable reactions of the Swiss authorities in dealing with holocaust refugees, and some of the manifestations of antisemitism within Switzerland.\\" = Final years = Hoff's final years were not entirely untroubled. She suffered problems with her ears which made it necessary for her to undergo periodic surgical interventions which were very painful. She also developed heart problems. More painful, however, was the illness and suffering of her friend Anna Tumarkin. Despite the care Hoff was able to lavish on her dying friend, eventually Tumarkin, now aged 75, had top be transferred to the \\"Siloah Diakonissenhaus\\" in Gümligen, on the south side of the city in the direction of Thun. Anna Tumarkin now faded away rapidly, dying six weeks later on 7 August 1951. Hoff's own will to live never entirely returned. She tried to channel her energies into work as much as possible. She also formulated new travel plans. An invitation to visit her cousin Clara - now living in Sweden - provided an element of light at the end of her tunnel of grieving. But her failing heart left her short of energy. She was forced to rest during the morning hours, only able to emerge towards the end of the afternoon to attend to a few long time patients. On the afternoon of 4 August 1952, by now aged 72, her heart began to fail more completely, and she died early the next morning, a couple of days before the first anniversary of Anna's death. Her body was cremated: the ashes were placed in an urn in Anna Tumarkin's grave in Bern's Bremgarten Cemetery.

Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.  History: Radio and television  The first initiatives to introduce technologies into education were carried out by States directly, as they were at the time embarking on wide-ranging education reforms. During that period – from decolonization through to the 1980s – the dominant paradigm in education, common to African States and international organizations, was that of the interventionist State. Against that background, major large- scale programmes were developed, which were to some extent successful. In this way, the Bouaké schools radio in Côte d'Ivoire allowed more than 2,000 teachers per year to be trained in the 1970s. Radio was one of the first technologies to be put to work in the service of education in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1986, in Guinea, an experimental schools radio project was started at the national educational research and documentation institute (l’Institut national de documentation, de recherche et d’action pédagogique, the present-day Indrap), with the assistance of the cultural and technical cooperation agency that is now the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). The radio broadcasts were therefore mainly focused on primary teachers’ needs so as to improve their teaching techniques, and on subjects that were considered as priorities for the pupils: French, arithmetic and science. In the early 1990s, radio was given a broader role in the promotion of basic education, with the support of UNICEF, especially with respect to girls’ access to education. While the results in terms of scholastic performance are still not properly understood, these programmes helped to train a large number of teachers. Throughout the 1960s, the concept of educational television took hold in Africa. One of the most iconic examples of the development of these programmes can be found in Côte d'Ivoire. After initial trials in Senegal and Niger (where educational television existed before national television) in 1965 and 1966, Côte d'Ivoire was chosen in 1971 as the testing ground, then for the large-scale roll-out, of a massive project for schooling via television. The Programme for Education by Television (PETV) was made the responsibility of UNESCO, assisted by cooperation from Belgium, France and the Ford Foundation. The PETV gave an illustration of how, from the 1970s, innovative programmes could be launched with the aid of the “new” ICT. In the first five years, the rate of school enrolment in that country went from 20% to over 60%. While 300,000 pupils were receiving the programmes in 1975-1976, this had increased to 700,000 by 1980 (out of a total of one million pupils). Some evaluation reports indicate that the proportion of pupils who had had the benefit of television courses entering the sixth year of study was significantly higher than for the others, that the percentage having to retake a year had fallen from 30% to 10% during the lifetime of the project, and that pupils had acquired a better mastery of spoken French. The programme ran for 14 years and finally ended in 1982.  Introduction of computer technology  Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like Computer Aid International, Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and World Computer Exchange. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like USAID, the African Bank or the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination. = Africa Information Society Initiative (AISI) = A large part of the backbone of ICT4D was the action framework called the Africa Information Society Initiative (AISI). Seeking to install the ICT infrastructure in Africa, its goals were to were connect every single African village with the global information network by 2010 and spur growth of smaller ICT initiatives in different sectors. A decade after its enactment, there are still hundreds of villages without electricity and connectivity between disparate ICTs is lacking. = One Laptop per Child (OLPC) = In the 2000s, various projects were begun, mainly aimed at giving each school child access to IT tools, individually or shared among a small group. Personalizing the practice of computer technology multiplies the potential uses of ICT in education, not just by familiarization with the technology tools themselves (learning technology), but also by the acquisition of cognitive skills (learning through technology). The American One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$200 and US$500, OLPC offered its ultraportable XO-1 computer at the price of US$100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was “bought” by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the large-scale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered. Sugar is the free teaching platform installed on the XO computers from the OLPC Foundation. Sugar is both a graphic interface at the same time as containing applications, and was designed specifically for children, to support them in their learning with a variety of available content: reading courses, drawing tools, e-books, interactive applications and so on. A school in Ethiopia that received laptops from the OLPC program = Criticisms of One Laptop per Child in Sub-Saharan Africa = Unlike more large scale efforts to integrate and enhance education, the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program faces criticism on the premise that targeting the poorest areas in Africa that may not have the financial viability to afford laptop computers and maintenance costs for the children. Despite its objectives of distributing 100 to 150 million laptops by the year 2008 to the developing countries with the most need, it is measured that as of August 2010, more than 80 percent of the 1.5 million laptops have been sent to high or upper middle income countries according to the World Bank's classifications. = Alternatives to One Laptop Per Child = In comparing the distribution of money of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program with other channels of education betterment, there are many low-cost programs that have more definitive impact than OPLC's distribution laptops to \\"low-income\\" countries. Some other proposed cost- benefit ratios for other aid programs seeking to improve educational and socioeconomic conditions include: * Spending $8 per individual per year over a span of 5 years could potentially save 11 million lives. * Spending $0.50 per student (this was implemented in Kenya), which was successful in increasing school participation by 14 percent. * Building schools. * Hiring additional instructors. * Focusing on minimizing and mitigating costs of attention school and getting textbooks. Many of these low-cost programs have sought to specifically increase the access to education for women in hopes of increase literacy, equality in pay, economic viability, better productivity, more democratic and responsive political institutions, and better overall public health. = Classmate PC = Following on from OLPC, the Intel group launched Classmate PC, a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the Seychelles and Kenya, particularly in rural areas. = Computer for School in Kenya (CFSK) = The CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya) project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.  Open Educational Resources (OER)  According to UNESCO in 2002, open educational resources (OERs) are open provisions of educational resources that are enabled by ICTs for use and adaptation by users for non-commercial users. In the context of teacher education in Sub-Saharan Africa, the most notable OER project is TESSA, Teacher Education in Sub- Saharan Africa, which constitutes 13 African institutions and five international organizations working to equip teachers with practical activities for classrooms and language specific modules. There are three different modes of use for OERs across the 200,000 teachers in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia: very structured modules, loosely structured modules, and guided modules. Specifically in Nigeria and Sudan, large-scale distance education is primarily used for teacher education and thus highly structured guides with TESSA study units are given to trainee teachers, who are often in rural areas with limited Internet access. Some criticisms of TESSA OERs cited by teachers include lack of relevance of curriculum materials and existing satisfaction with current resources.  Sustainable ICT for development in Sub-Saharan Africa  One of the most prominent paradigms for technological change and innovation in Sub- Saharan African has been the information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) initiative. Positioned as an avenue to move millions of individuals out of poverty in developing regions, few reports on experiments of such practices have demonstrated success of ICT4D on the standard of living in Africa. Regardless, ICT4D is still rendered as one of the most prominent technological interventions in the region. Every year, proposals for more sustainable ICT4D initiatives are suggested by researchers from around the world at the AFRICOMM Conference. = Motivations for Sustainable ICT =  Landscape  With the advent of new technologies and communication as a means for organization and development between public and private sectors in developing countries, in addition to the growing penetration of mobile devices due to their increasing affordability, the poor in Sub-Saharan African have largely been seen as both producers and consumers of information and communication technologies. According to a 2013 study conducted by the GSM Association, the number of mobile subscribers in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased 18 percent per year between the years 2007 and 2012. In 2012, the number of mobile subscriptions in Sub-Saharan African reached almost 650 million, greater than both that in the US and EU. Android penetration is the highest due to easy integration of social innovation tools in areas of e-health, e-learning, waste management, mobile banking, etc., and phones are the preferred way for many to access the internet. Initially, ICT in Sub- Saharan Africa was primarily restricted to private use, but today it has been introduced in formal and institutional spheres as a tool for development, social growth, economic expansion and population growth. A study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGC) released in November 2015 highlights that the internet only contributes 2.9 percent to Kenya's GDP and 1.2 percent to South Africa's GDP.  Mobile ICT  There is a huge push for mobile ICT in Sub-Saharan Africa for three key reasons: # Nations in this region are expanding their telecommunications sectors. # Consumers are unsatisfied with the inadequate fixed-line ICT. # Wireless technology has rapidly diffused, and this is the base for mediating business transactions. This lends to the growth of a sustainable m-commerce sector.  Motivations for Growth  Beyond trying to increase GDP growth in the short-term, ICT is covered in four of the 17 different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were selected by the UN in September 2015. Seen and described as a catalyst for education, infrastructure development, sustainable industrialization and gender equality, the motivations for ICT's spread are outlined below: # Catalyst for development - Initially more pertinent to leisure use cases, ICT intersects with a wide array of basic need issues in areas of education, transportation, health, energy use, nutrition, water accessibility, etc. There have been many successful catalyst companies as a result, and some notable ones include: ## Obami - a social and educational learning platform that started in South Africa and has been adopted by more than 30,000 educators in schools across Sub-Saharan Africa. ## Gifted Mom - a mobile health platform that started in Cameroon and betters the health conditions of women who are pregnant and newborn children in rural communities. ## M-Pesa - a mobile payment system that originally launched in Kenya and now has more than 30 million users who utilize it for loans, health provisions, purchases and international transfers. ### Significance: This example is particularly important to educational technology, because it was largely dependent on policy decisions from the Kenyan government to encourage competition in the sector of telecommunications and ICT-driven innovation, which broke the monopoly of state-led telecommunications and fostered competition among firms. The case of M-Pesa also highlights the importance of communal trust that enables the successful integration of ICTs into various socio-economic activities on an institutional level. Without the incorporation and on-boarding of ICT objectives on the national development agenda, coupled with agreement of local stakeholders, M-Pesa would not have been as successful as it has been. Applied to the case of educational technology, unilaterally funded ICTs may be largely unsuccessful to enact institutional change without the willingness of the local and national governments. ## Jumia - an online shopping marketplace that began in Nigeria and has spread to 23 different African countries. ## W Afate - a $100 3-D printer that is constructed from discarded electronic waste. ## M-Louma - a web and mobile platform that connects farmers with food buyers using real-time market price estimates, localizations and information for improving the agriculture supply chain. # Inclusive growth - Proponents of ICT suggest that its worthiness extends beyond a luxury for Africa and seeks to efficiently contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth for many different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. # Opportunity for sustainability - Currently, little has been done in the management of electrical and electronic waste (EEW). Without necessary regulations for dealing with recycling waste, there is a large market for tools in sustainability. # Improving education - In a study on ICT adoption and the digital divide, it was found that the usage of computers and Internet access is directly linked to education. If the growth of the Internet aligns with mobile emergence in the early 2000s, then it is projected that ICT can add approximately $300 billion to Africa's GDP by the year 2025. Dr. Hamadoun I. Toure, the secretary general of ITU, explains the extent of educational tech possibilities in his remarks: > \\"ICTs are truly transformational. With the power of technology, we can > educate every African citizen, right across the continent. With the power of > technology, we can open new opportunities and create new well-paid jobs for > our people. With the power of technology we can deliver healthcare services > to every African citizen, even in the remotest villages. And with the power > of technology we can empower African women and leverage the fantastic energy > and passion of young Africans. This is not just a pipe-dream: this is real.\\" #  Criticisms  # Vague agenda - From 2005, the UN ICT Task Force has attempted to implement a clear agenda about ICT priorities and implementation strategy, yet this has not been created. Only broad, global goals have been set, and the major players in these have largely been the government bodies administration and non-governmental organizations that have been funded by the respective UN agency. # Knowledge gap - In order for ICT to truly provide inclusive growth, there needs to be educational structures and resources made available to understand how to use ICT. Currently, most of the learning is very informal (through friends or family) because administrations have typically refrained from investing in the digital sphere among other initiatives. # Minimal return on experiences - Questions about the success of ICT initiatives remain as there is a lack of documentation on failed and successful experiences. = Avenues for ICT Research in Education in Sub- Saharan Africa = The success or failure of ICTs in Sub-Saharan Africa is highly dependent on and challenged by regional problems such as food and water shortage, pandemic diseases, wars, or heritage loss. Some areas that have been identified for more immediate ICT4D action include health management, food and water, peace, and heritage. In terms of research initiatives that pertain to educational technology, one important use case is e-Learning, where the issue of penetration results from its targets. For example, in rural areas, e-Learning serves the purpose of advertisement and even propaganda, while in urban areas the purpose is more oriented to overcoming the shortage of teaching personnel. #  Barriers to ICT Use by Teachers in SSA  There are many physical and cultural factors that inhibit the complete adoption and integration of ICT practices by teachers in Sub-Saharan including and not limited to: unreliable access to electricity, limited software and hardware provisions, language limitation, country size and terrain, and population dispersion. Educational limiting factors include teachers' literacy rates, access to professional development, and missing unified national policy on computer use in schools.  Distance learning in higher education  The main initiatives based on the use of ICT and the Internet in education originally focused on distance learning at university level. Thus, the African Virtual University (AVU), set up by the World Bank in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU currently has ten e-learning centres. The Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) has also, since 1999, set up around forty French-speaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and master's degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support. More recently, the MOOCs (Massive Open On- line Courses) phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe. The AUF is funding the development of the first MOOCs in higher education in Africa, in partnership with the French Ministry for Higher Education and with the support of UNESCO, and will use this form of remote learning to offer training and certification in ICTE skills for teachers. The African universities are taking a growing interest in this new method of learning, especially in view of the ever-increasing demand for higher education at a time when the continent is experiencing a deficit in qualified teachers.  M-learning  M-learning (or m-education), or the use of mobile technology in the service of education, is a recent practice, opening up fresh possibilities in the educational field. Given the shortage of books in many African schools, the digital tablet was soon seen as a solution to make up for the missing textbooks, and taken up both by governments and international organizations. In practice, this shortage is one that affects almost every African country. In Cameroon there is on average one textbook on reading per 11 pupils and one mathematics book per 13 children.UNESCO, Information bulletin: School and teaching resources in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012, http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/ib9-regional-education- africa-2012-en-v5.pdf The price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to the traditional media (books, CD and DVD, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook,AFD, Les TIC au service de l’Éducation. Étude de cas : WorldReader, collaborative seminar, 4–5 October 2012, http://www.afd.fr/ webdav/shared/PORTAILS/SECTEURS/EDUCATION/pdf/20120905Etude%20de%20cas%20WorldReader.pdf with zero marginal cost. The digital tablet today has potential uses that extend beyond the classroom. The American NGO WorldReader has set itself the goal of extending access to reading to the most underprivileged children by distributing readers designed by Amazon. With the financial support of USAID, Kindles have been made available to 600,000 children in nine States in sub- Saharan Africa. The NGO has stated that children using this system spend 50% more time on reading, and read up to 90 books per year. Moreover, the report published by USAID following the iRead impact study in Ghana of 337 pupils in six different schools in 2010-2011 shows a number of positive aspects of the use of readers. The pupils using Kindles proved to be more enthusiastic about reading, which allowed them to improve their technical skills and achieve better scores in the standardized tests. Old and outdated traditional computer hardware and the costs of maintenance have prompted those devising projects to turn to technologies that are cheaper to buy and easier to handle. Internet access is made easier by tablets and by the possibility of connecting via the mobile networks. Relatively cheap compared to the laptop computer and more flexible in its uses, tablets have the potential to provide an efficient response to part of the educational needs of sub-Saharan Africa.

History Traditionally, children who are identified as having an intersex condition at birth were killed, and mothers may be accused of witchcraft. This is beginning to change, with the help of intersex civil society organizations like SIPD Uganda, but stigma, violence, abuse and exploitation still persist. In December 2017, African intersex activists published a statement setting out local demands.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy  thumbright260px Reports suggest that the birth of an intersex infant can be regarded as a curse or bad omen, resulting in infanticide, neglect, and the stigmatization of the mother. Mothers may even be expelled from their community, and intersex children may be separated from siblings. Intersex persons may experience coercive medical interventions, in medical settings and outside medical settings. However, intersex persons who require medical attention may also have difficulties accessing necessary treatment. A 2014 Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law report identified multiple cases where surgeries and medical interventions led to human rights abuses. In one case, surgery conducted by medical practitioners without family consent led to the child having health problems and dropping out of school. In another case, a child was abandoned at hospital after genital surgery because of the cost of treatment. The hospital discontinued his treatment. Sam Lyomoki, a Ugandan MP and a doctor, has stated that the parliament \\"issued guidelines in 2015 to the Ministry of Health advising against surgical intervention for intersex infants\\", however, \\"Local radio stations in Uganda buzz with appeals seeking donors to help fund genital reshaping surgery abroad\\" and surgeries are also carried out within Uganda. Local organization SIPD Uganda \\"advocates for the 'best guess' non-surgical approach where an intersex child should be raised in the best-suited gender, without irreversible surgical intervention, until they can be active participants in the decision\\". Protection from discrimination thumbright260px The constitution of Uganda provides for recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms, equality and non- discrimination, privacy, education and affirmative action. The African Charter on the rights and welfare of the African child commits member countries, including Uganda, to the protection of all children – including intersex children – against social, economic, cultural and political abuse and exploitation. In practice, intersex persons remain subject to violence, discrimination and abuse. In research by SIPD Uganda, 90% of intersex youth reported that they were forced to drop out of school because of the immense stigma and discrimination associated with the non-binary development of their intersex body.\\" Identification documents The Registration of Persons Act 2015 allows for the registration of a child born a \\"hermaphrodite\\", and for change of name and change of sex classification. The recommendation of a medical clinician is required. Changes of name can create social problems, and the situation of adults is uncertain. Many intersex persons are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents.  Rights advocacy SIPD Uganda has called for recognition of the human rights of intersex people in Uganda, and in the East African region, including protection from harmful surgeries, access to care, protection from discrimination and abuse, and access to education and employment. SIPD Uganda has worked with some 700 intersex persons in the 25 Ugandan administrative districts where it delivers services. The organization also convened a 2014 regional meeting of intersex advocates allies from Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda. Intersex is commonly confused with being lesbian or gay, and this has consequences for organizing and disclosure, as well as discrimination towards intersex persons. Julius Kaggwa, the executive director of SIPD, describes the situation in Uganda as dangerous.

The Landscape of Senjōjiki Cirque and its formation There are several glacial landforms confirmed near Mount Hōken, such as Senjōjiki cirque, Nogaike cirque, and Snnosawa cirques. Mount Hōken itself is a pyramidal peak made by glacial-erosion. Senjōjiki Cirque is located on the top of Nakagoshodani Valley. It forms typical cirque landscape, with flat cirque bottom, steep cirque wall with naked rock. The bottom of the cirque is about 2600m above sea level. 11 terminal moraines are confirmed around the cirque bottom. Geologist Tatsuto Aoki examined glacial deposits from moraines of Senjojiki and Nogaike cirques, and found they were created 17 to 25 thousands year ago, at the time of the last maximum glacial age.Tatsuto Aoki,\\"Chronometry of Glacial Deposits by the 10BeExposure Dating Method: A Case Study in the Senjōjiki and Nogaike Cirques, Northern Kiso mountain range, central Japan\\" Plants around Senjōjiki Cirque In summer, Senjōjiki Cirque is filled by alpine flowers.

The clashes began with the People's Protection Units (YPG)'s entrance into the civil war in July 2012 and spread across the governorate. Background As of 2011, the Hasakah Governorate had a population of more than 1.5 million people. It is one of the most diverse regions in Syria. The diverse population of the governorate includes Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians, Turkmen, Circassians, and Yazidis. The Arab tribes in the area are divided into several tribal confederations which play a role in the civil war. Anti-government protests had been ongoing in the Kurdish-inhabited areas of Syria since March 2011, as part of the wider Syrian uprising, but armed conflict in the region only started after the opposition Democratic Union Party (PYD) and Kurdish National Council (KNC) signed a seven-point agreement on 11 June 2012 in Erbil under the auspice of Iraqi Kurdistan president Massoud Barzani. This agreement, however, failed to be implemented. A new cooperation agreement between the two sides was signed on 12 July which saw the creation of the Kurdish Supreme Committee as a governing body of all Kurdish-controlled territories in Syria. The campaign =First week: YPG claims territory= On 20 July 2012, the YPG took control of the city of Amuda and established checkpoints outside it. The city fell without any major clashes, as the Syrian Army withdrew without any significant resistance and pulled out to fight elsewhere. A joint committee between the PYD and the KNC was planned to take over the administration of captured towns. The city of Derik was expected to be captured hours later. The goal of the KSC was the \\"full liberation of Syrian Kurdistan\\", restore peace and order, and to prevent the Free Syrian Army (FSA) from entering Kurdish-majority areas. On the same day, the Kurdish Coordination Committees, a Kurdish opposition group, demanded Syrian security forces to withdraw from Qamishli, the largest city in Syria with a majority Kurdish population. \\"Otherwise, they will be forced to leave\\", the KCC threatened. The YPG then prepared for an operation in Qamishli. On 21 July, the YPG entered Derik and clashes took place. On the same day, Syrian government forces attacked a patrol of YPG fighters and wounded one fighter. The next day it was reported that Kurdish forces were still fighting for al-Malikiyah, where a Kurdish activist was killed after government security forces opened fire on protesters. The YPG also took control over parts of the towns of Ras al-Ayn () and al-Darbasiyah (), after government security and political units withdrew from these areas, following an ultimatum issued by the Kurds. On the same day, clashes erupted in Qamishli between YPG and government forces in which one Kurdish fighter was killed and two were wounded along with a government official. The ease with which Kurdish forces captured the towns and the government troops pulled back was speculated to be due to the government reaching an agreement with the Kurds so military forces from the area could be freed up to engage rebel forces in the rest of the country. However, Salih Muslim Muhammad, co-leader of the PYD, denied that there was any agreement between the PYD and the government. On 24 July, the PYD announced that Syrian security forces withdrew from the small Kurdish city of 16,000 of al-Ma'bada (), located between al-Malikiyah and the Syria–Turkey border. The YPG forces afterwards took control of all government institutions in the town. =August–October 2012: YPG consolidates gains= On 2 August 2012, the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change announced that most Kurdish-majority cities in Syria, with the exception of Qamishli and Hasaka, were no longer controlled by government forces and were now being governed by Kurdish political parties. In Qamishli, government military and police forces remained in their barracks and administration officials in the city allowed the Kurdish flag to be raised. Later in August 2012, 6 military officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces, led by Colonel Hassan al- Abdullah, announced the formation of the \\"Revolutionary Military Council in Hasakah Governorate\\", part of the Free Syrian Army. On the same day, a FSA group called the \\"Believers in God Battalion\\" captured a police station on the road between Aleppo and Hasakah. On 18 August, the government's intelligence center in Qamishli was bombed. The Hamza Battalion of the FSA claimed responsibility for the bombing. This caused concerns among Kurdish parties in Qamishli as they have refused to allow the FSA to enter Kurdish-majority areas. On 30 September, a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at the government intelligence center in Qamishli, killing between 4 and 8 people. =November 2012–January 2013: Islamists join the fight and the Battle of Ras al-Ayn= On 8 November 2012, Free Syrian Army groups attacked Syrian Army positions in Ras al-Ayn and took control of parts of the city. A correspondent on the ground said that local Kurds aided the FSA in the attack. 300 jihadist fighters from Ghuraba al-Sham then entered the city, although it did not enter the neighbourhoods controlled by the PYD and the latter did not intervene in the clashes between the rebels and the government. Around 10-26 rebels and 20 Syrian soldiers were killed in the fighting, while about 8,000 residents fled to Ceylanpınar as fighting raged. On 10 November, YPG militiamen aided by local Kurds stormed the last government security and administrative stations in the towns of al-Darbasiyah () and Tel Tamer. This attack was prompted by violence in Ras al-Ayn where the FSA and Islamist rebels stormed the town because of the presence of government security units. 12 November, the PYD forced the last Syrian government forces to withdraw from Derik. On 15 November, the rebels led by al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front announced that they had taken full control of Ras al-Ayn, capturing or killing the last remaining Syrian Army soldiers stationed there. There were also no government airstrikes in the town for the first time in three days, as government forces gave up trying to retake the city. Al-Nusra Front fighters summarily executed dozens of Syrian soldiers after they captured a border outpost near Ras al-Ayn. Inside the town, al-Nusra implemented Sharia and burned a liquor store. This caused a confrontation with the YPG. On 19 November, the Islamist rebels launched an assault on the PYD in Ras al-Ayn A rebel sniper also assassinated Abed Khalil, the president of the local PYD council. By the next, SOHR reported that the death toll in the rebel-PYD fighting in the town had reached 34. The opposition activist group Local Coordination Committees of Syria put the number of deaths at 46. Also on 19 November, members of the al-Nusra Front and Ghuraba al-Sham opened fire on a YPG checkpoint, sparking clashes that killed dozens of people. The rebels planned to launch an offensive in Qamishli, but were stopped by the Assyrian Democratic Organization. Meanwhile, pro-government Arab tribes in Qamishli organized themselves into the Popular Committees and clashed with the PYD. As a result of the fighting, there was a buildup in the number of forces deployed by both sides in Ras al-Ayn. By 22 November, Kurdish forces had strengthened their numbers to around 400 militiamen, who faced 200 fighters from the al-Nusra Front and 100 fighters from Ghuraba al-Sham. By the same day, the fighting killed more than 54 people. The next day, however, a tenuous two-day ceasefire was announced between Kurdish fighters and the al-Nusra Front and Ghuraba al-Sham in order to determine terms of a possible permanent agreement between the two sides. Prior to this announcement, the PYD claimed that its forces had killed 25 rebels. Negotiations between the two sides on 4 December resulted in a fragile truce that lasted only until 6 December, when clashes broke out again. From 12 to 14 December, rebels conducted a series of rocket attacks on the town. It was reported that they had also tried and failed to expand fighting to the nearby towns and villages. Negotiations between the Arab rebels and Kurds resumed on 15 December. An agreement was reached the next day. On 17 December, a ceasefire came into effect between local Kurdish militias and Arab rebels. Under the terms of the ceasefire, both sides were to withdraw from the city, share checkpoints surrounding it, and transfer its administration to local civilian Kurds, Arabs, Chechens, and Christians. Though fighting ended, fighters on both sides failed to withdraw, raising concerns about the strength of the truce. Fighting in Ras al-Ayn resumed on 17 January 2013. By 22 January, more than 56 people were killed in a week of fighting in Ras al-Ayn. =February 2013: al-Qaeda launches new offensive, ceasefire between YPG and FSA= On 12 February 2013, the al-Nusra Front launched an offensive on the Syrian Army in the town of al-Shaddadah in the southern Hasaka Governorate. 2 days later, al-Nusra took full control of the town and killed around 100 Syrian soldiers. On 18 February, an agreement was reached between the Kurdish Supreme Committee and FSA groups in Ras al-Ayn. The terms of agreement include the withdrawal of all foreign fighters from Ras al-Ayn, joint checkpoints between the YPG and the FSA, the establishment of a joint city council in Ras al-Ayn, the creation of a local police force, and cooperation between the two groups to fight the Syrian government. =March 2013: YPG take control of oil fields= Situation in Qamishli, mid-March 2013 Situation in al-Hasakah, mid- March 2013 In March 2013, the YPG surrounded Syrian forces in Rmelan and al- Qahtaniya and took control of the towns without firing a shot. The YPG also took over the oil fields in the area. Meanwhile further south, multiple rebel groups including Ahrar al-Jazeera, the al-Nusra Front, Ghuraba al-Sham, and Ahrar al-Sham captured the town of al-Yaarubiyah on the Iraq–Syria border. In Qamishli, the PYD controlled 40% of the city while the government controlled the remaining parts. Meanwhile, clashes between rebels and the Syrian Army erupted in Tell Hamis. =April 2013: renewed YPG-government clashes in Qamishli, concurrent rebel offensive= On 5 April 2013, 3 YPG fighters and 3 Syrian soldiers were killed in clashes in Qamishli city. This marked the first time that Syrian government forces attacked the YPG in Qamishli for several months. On 13 April, the Syrian Revolution General Commission's 313th Brigade declared the start of a rebel offensive south of Qamishli. The rebels launched an attack on the Syrian Army's 154th Brigade base in southern Qamishli. Both the PYD and the KNC stated their intentions to prevent fighting in the city, but according to al-Akhbar, the rebels contacted the YPG and were given a pathway to attack the base. In response to the rebel offensive, the Syrian Air Force conducted airstrikes on rebel-held villages south of Qamishli. Fighting also reached Qamishli Airport. The battle was described as a \\"massacre\\" by UNICEF. =May–September 2013: YPG fully capture Ras al-Ayn; further YPG gains= In June 2013, clashes between the PYD and anti-PYD protesters took place in Amuda. Opponents of the PYD stated that fighters had opened fire on protesters following tensions with pro-Free Syrian Army youth committees and rival Kurdish groups. The PYD on the other hand stated it had been attacked by a mercenary gang. On 17 July, Kurdish fighters expelled the remaining jihadists of the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from Ras al-Ayn after a night of fighting and soon after took control of the border crossing with Turkey.AFP, \\"Syrie: les Kurdes infligent une cuisante défaite aux jihadistes\\", L'Orient le Jour, 17 July 2013. Islamist forces retreated from Ras al-Ayn to Tal Half, Asfar and Najar, which were under rebel control. On 19 July, the YPG captured the village of Tal A'lo. Fighting was still continuing in Karhouk and A'li Agha. The next day, Kurdish fighters captured an al-Nusra checkpoint near the contested villages. By this point, 35 jihadists and 19 YPG fighters had been killed in the fighting. At the end of August 2013, the Syrian Air Force conducted an airstrike on the PYD-held town of Derik. =October–December 2013: YPG capture border town; ISIL offensives= In October 2013, Ahrar al-Jazeera was expelled from the border town of al-Yaarubiyah by the al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and other Salafist jihadist groups. At the end of the month, YPG forces supported by local Arab tribes and Iraq captured Yarubiya from the jihadists after a 4-day battle. From October to December 2013, ISIL conducted a campaign of suicide bombings on both YPG and Syrian government's National Defence Forces in Qamishli. Meanwhile, fighting between the YPG and ISIL, supported by al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham, escalated in the countryside of Qamishli.

It went live in April 2017 and transition is expected to have been completed by March 2019. History =NHSnet= NHSnet was a private wide area network service used by the NHS England. It started operation in around 1995 NHSnet was managed jointly by BT and Cable & Wireless and was developed under the aegis of the NHS Information Authority. However the standards of service varied widely throughout the NHS due to different local practices and levels of equipment. NHSnet was succeeded by N3 in 2006. It is sometimes referred to (by a sort of retrospective nomination) as \\"N2\\". Connections to NHSnet were strictly controlled by the NHS Information Authority, which specified the security required and data protocols allowed under its 'Code of Connect' agreements. Similarly, it controlled access to or from the Internet, including email, through managed gateways. Organisations wishing to provide information or applications to their NHS partners over NHSnet had a choice of applying for their own Code of Connection, which required a considerable investment in time (typically 6 months), effort and infrastructure; or partnering with one of the restricted number of organisations (BT, Cable and Wireless and Ioko) able to use their own Code of Connect for these purposes. NHSnet admin passwords were exposed, during the attack of Lulzsec in June 2011. =N3= N3 is a national broadband network for the English National Health Service (NHS), connecting all NHS locations and 1.3 million employees across England. it is being phased out. In 2004, BT was awarded the contract to deliver and manage the IT project on behalf of the NHS. N3 was preceded by NHSnet, becoming N3 in 2006. N3 provides the foundations to deliver other components of the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) such as Choose and Book, the NHS Care Records Service, Electronic Prescriptions and the NHS Picture Archiving and Communications System. Technical details N3 runs over a high-speed IP- based virtual private network. It links acute hospitals and GP surgeries in England through 58 points of presence (POPs), and also has a further five POPs in Scotland. N3 is fully resilient at backbone and POP level, enabling 100% core network service availability. The standardised national infrastructure will enable the rollout of 21st Century healthcare IT applications and the next generation of IP-based converged communications solutions. Compliance with ISO 20000. A range of N3 hosting providers can provide Information Governance Statement of Compliance (IG SoC) accredited, secure, third party application hosting services. Providers can also act in an advisory capacity to organisations wishing to offer bespoke applications to the NHS. Progress In March 2007, N3’s Voice Services were launched. These services offer free on-net calls, and potential to reduce fixed-to-mobile costs. N3 Voice Services As the N3 Service Provider (N3SP), BT works with NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) to support the delivery of the NPfIT, and develop products and services to capitalise on N3’s state-of-the-art capabilities. The N3 network enables the user to access NHS Wide Web (nww) prefixed sites, as well as www. Transition HSCN, delivered by multiple suppliers adhering to an agreed set of standards, is intended to progressively replace the N3 national healthcare network. The N3 data and voice networking contracts expired in March 2017. NHS Digital looked to replace a long-term single supplier contract with a marketplace of network options. The project for a new network was initially known as the Public Services Network for Health. In January 2017, the managed services provider Redcentric was appointed for a three-year period as the peering exchange provider. NHS Digital have also contracted with BT for the provision of transition network arrangements for the two to three years from April 2017. It is anticipated that the transition from the N3 network will be complete by March 2019.

For a time, it was New Zealand's largest wool exporter. Its business began in Green Island, Dunedin as a fellmongery owned by the Melbourne partners. Under direction of young John Roberts from 1867, it made very substantial investments in rural property in Otago and Hawke's Bay and spread as a stock and station agency through Otago and Southland and the lower half of the North Island. Ownership was transferred to a newly incorporated limited liability company in 1910. Until then it had been owned by a complicated network of partners with its core in Scotland, England, and Dunedin. Additional different subsidiary partnerships in different regions were set up to include local management. Murray Roberts & Co Limited was purchased in 1961 by another Dunedin-based business, London-listed company, National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand. Becoming fully integrated with the operations of National Mortgage it lost most of its separate identity in 1963 though some operations continued until 1965. Origin George Roberts, a woollen manufacturer of Selkirk, Scotland sent his 19-year-old fourth son, John, to Melbourne, Australia in 1864 to join young John Sanderson in a new colonial venture with the Sanderson and Murray families from nearby Galashiels. Sanderson Murray & Co owned a very substantial woolbrokers and import-export merchants in Gresham Street, London. John was required by his father to learn the colonial business, buy wool supplies and sell Selkirk's high quality products. Over two years he worked on two runs, the second belonging to young John Sanderson. Sanderson did not pay him for his twelve months' work. George Roberts wanted his own supply of wool. A new land act restricted the properties young Roberts could buy in Victoria and run for himself, and at his father's suggestion in 1867 he crossed to Dunedin where there was no restriction on buying available land. Sanderson Murray & Co had a small fellmongery at Green Island. Unwilling Roberts and his younger brother were required nevertheless to take charge. The fellmongery never prospered but it was the first centre of Murray Roberts' operations. Murray Roberts & Co A partnership was formed in June 1868 with two-thirds owned by Sanderson Murray & Co and one-third by John Roberts, using money from his father. An office and store were bought in Stafford Street, Dunedin, and the business was established as wool and skin merchants, scourers, classers, fellmongers and general merchants. In 1870 Roberts married Dunedin's Louisa Kettle, daughter of city surveyor Charles Kettle. Louisa's brother Nathaniel worked for Murray Roberts & Co and later established the stock and station agency Williams & Kettle.A A Roberts, A Family Affair, a history of Murray Roberts & Co Limited, Pictorial Publications, Hastings New Zealand 1982The successor firms of both companies would eventually be combined in 2005 when Wrightson NMA (the successor to the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand) and Williams & Kettle were part of the merger which created PGG Wrightson. Murray Roberts & Co was in the early years more a land investment and station management business, and did not lend to small Central Otago farmers, though later that changed. There were continuing difficulties with funds and approvals from Sanderson Murray & Co in London. London was now under the control of John Sanderson, the young man of the same age who had failed to pay Roberts for a year's work on his run in Victoria. In 1882 John Roberts, now 37, decided to retire from daily involvement. However he seemed unable to find a suitable replacement, however, and in the end stayed on until 1896 when, diagnosed with a thyroid condition, he handed day-to-day responsibilities to his eldest son. Around 1900 policies changed, wool auctioneering began and livestock activities developed. Stock agents were hired for the lower part of the North Island. From 1910 a full range of stock and station agency services were offered.

His own wool could be shipped directly to Scotland without the expense of middle-men. The policy of crossbreeding on Murray Roberts' stations to establish the desired qualities of the wool led to the Corriedale breed. The first major investment in pastoral activities was Lauder station in 1868. In 1871 Murray Roberts & Co had begun buying wool on commission for North American importers and supplying from their own pastoral properties. New Zealand prices for wool were so low it led in 1873 to young John Roberts' establishment of the Mosgiel Woollen Mill. Because all wool dealings were on commission, the price of wool directly affected the profits of Murray Roberts & Co. The partnership began wool auctioneering in 1897 in Wellington, and their Hawkes Bay operation followed in 1905. The South Island operation continued to buy on commission for its American and British clients right through until 1961. In the North Island the wool operations were quite different. Murray Roberts sold at local auctions on behalf of their farmer clients. By 1960 the Wellington branch was offering 20,000 bales a year and Hawkes Bay 24,000 a year on behalf of their clients. =Livestock= As with lending to Otago farmers that were not in a very substantial way of business Murray Roberts & Co were not interested in livestock dealing. Again, this changed in the early 20th century in both Southland and the North Island, and Murray Roberts bought shares in sale yards in their various territories as they built their branch network. S S Dunedin loading, Port Chalmers 1882 =Refrigeration= Murray Roberts & Co provided part of the cargo of the SS Dunedin on New Zealand's first successful shipment of frozen meat, 349 sheep, in 1882. =Merchandise= Dipping sheep Merchandise traded by the company included liquor, ERG car batteries, and India tyres (from Scotland), wholesale grocery for clients and for retailers in large rural towns, and general farm requirements such as fencing wire and Coopers sheep dip. =Agencies= Agencies provided substantial income, among them the Shaw Savill loading agency, the North British and Mercantile Insurance fire and general insurance, and the British and Foreign Marine Insurance Company. =Grain and seeds merchants= A seed dressing operation was also part of the company's business. Wartime bulk buying contracts The period of the First World War gave a time of stability to New Zealand's agriculture and pastoral sector through bulk buying contracts between the New Zealand and British governments at good prices (set by the British government with the local government). The contracts for frozen meat ended on 30 June 1920 and the wool contract expired the same June. The British government was anxious to have it all shipped to England by November 1920 and growers were faced by free markets.National Mortgage And Agency Company Of New Zealand, Ltd. The Times, Thursday, 25 March 1920; pg. 24; Issue 42368 The end of this comfortable co-relationship was followed immediately by a postwar slump and many in the industry suffered major financial difficulties. Though this slump proved brief, it was followed very soon after by other similar short sharp events. Branches =Wellington= In 1875, a partnership was formed for a Wellington branch and named Murray, Common and Company. Charles Cairns Murray and William Common were the local partners. A Napier office was opened in 1877, then Gisborne was added the following year. After a dispute Common left the Wellington partnership, taking the Gisborne business, which he operated himself. The headquarters were moved from Dunedin to Wellington in 1910, at the time of incorporation of the limited liability company. A wool store was built in Thorndon Quay in 1907, and another across the road on reclaimed land in 1917, where the wool store operation remained until it moved to Seaview in the 1960s. Agencies were opened in Masterton in 1913, and after World War I more followed at Feilding, Dannevirke, and Hāwera. The Masterton agency took the first steps into livestock activities previously passed to Levin & Co. All these branches closed in the Great Depression of the 1930s, though there was a revival in 1934 with the branch at Wanganui extending to include an office at Taihape. In 1961 Masterton opened a Martinborough office. =Invercargill= A looser arrangement was also made in 1878 for Invercargill. It was broken up in 1892, as it proved to be only moderately successful. In 1923 a new agency was established in Invercargill. =Dunedin= Dunedin became a branch of the new incorporation in 1910 when the headquarters of Murray Robert & Co moved to Wellington, and an agency was set up in Gore for merchandise items. Though it was where the business was founded, Dunedin was always a modestly sized operation, mainly because it centred on the involvement in the stations and Stronach Morris — a company in which Murray Roberts & Co had an interest — handled all the Murray Roberts & Co clients' wool clip. The original fellmongery continued but, never very profitable, it was finally closed in 1915 and the buildings were sold in 1917. =Hawke's Bay= Established in Napier 1877 as an agency from Wellington, it became the principal and most profitable region for Murray Roberts & Co. Further expansion took place in 1887 with an office in Hastings and again in 1913 when an agent was set up in Waipukurau. In 1884 a quarter share in Richardson & Co was acquired. Richardson was operating two coastal steamers, SS Fairy and SS Weka, and two lighters. Further steamers were added as the company grew: SS Tuna in 1885, SS Kahu (1886), SS Fanny (1890), and SS Toroa (1900). Murray Roberts & Co sold it share in Richardson & Co in 1909. During the 1950s the Hawkes Bay branch took over from Wellington as Murray Roberts & Co's most profitable branch. By the end of the 1950s its profits were equal to the profits of all the other branches combined. National Mortgage and Agency were considered to be weak in the Hawke's Bay region, and Murray Roberts & Co's Hawkes Bay operation was a likely major reason for the takeover. =Gisborne= 1915 Overland car A Poverty Bay branch was set up in 1905. For the first ten years all the business was in merchandising. There were some meat exports, but little wool was handled. With the advent of the First World War the quantity of wool handled rose abruptly, in part because of the bulk buying contracts. The branch also won a fat stock agency with meat export company Thos Borthwick & Sons. They were provided with an Overland car and a Humber motorcycle. A horse and buggy was retained. A postwar slump in 1920 reduced activity and business did not recover during the 1920s or in the following Great Depression. Recovery did begin in 1937 and the early 1950s was a period of prosperity. =Wanganui= Wanganui branch was established in 1924. Its first ten years were not consistently profitable and the staff numbers remained at just three. The branch's main growth began after the Second World War. Stronach Morris & Co Limited =Otago and Southland= In 1905 Sir John Roberts and his family bought 62.5 per cent of the capital of a new company, Stronach Morris & Co, incorporated to own a well-established stock and station agency and wool broking business of the same name. Stronach Morris already held agencies in Middlemarch, Tapanui, Balclutha, and Waikouaiti, with a share in the Wyndham saleyards. The bulk of their business was in Otago, but there was a strong link with Southland. The wool trade and livestock were new areas for Murray Roberts. After Murray Roberts bought into the business, growth was initially slow. An agency opened in Cromwell in 1919 then, following a resurgence in 1937, another agency in the Maniototo and another in Lawrence in 1949. This represented an unusually wide network for a Dunedin-based stock and station agency. Stronach Morris auctioned livestock from Burnside and also in Cromwell, Omakau, Alexandra, Waipiata, Owhiro, Otago, Evansdale and Wyndham. Rabbit skin sales ended in 1955. Usually more than 100 tons of skins were sold by Stronach Morris's public auction every fortnight. New laws had been enacted to remove any possible profit motive that might encourage allowing rabbits to breed. Stronach Morris competed directly with Murray Roberts & Co in merchandise. The wool of Murray Roberts & Co clients was sold by Stronach Morris and wool and livestock activities in Otago were left to Stronach aside from Murray Roberts & Co's buying on commission for their own long-established overseas clients. By the time of the purchase by NMA Murray Roberts owned all but 17% of Stronach Morris & Co. Stations =Pastoral leases= Murray Roberts & Co as pastoral investors and sheep breeders shared in partnerships which held these properties: ;Otago Patearoa : ca 1868 Lauder Station. A lease of 45,000 acres with a further 1,000 acres of freehold sold 1882 to Ross & Glendining, Lauder : 1872 Strath Taieri Station renamed Gladbrook station taken over on own account by John Roberts. Middlemarch: : 1873 Patearoa Station Patearoa : ca 1874 Henley Station, Henley : 1877 Carterhope near Balclutha : 1878 Ringway Station Otautau : 1880s Cottesbrook near Middlemarch ;Hawkes Bay Shipping wool at Ākitio : 1878 Tautane Herbertville : 1880 Te Putere and Putere no. 1 Wairoa : 1880 (circa) Hawkestone Puketitiri : 1880 Clive Grange Clive : 1880s Mangatutu Raukawa : 1880s Marainanga (Ākitio South) auctioned in 1908 in 22 blocks Having played a major part in developing pastoral land in Otago and Hawkes Bay, the sale of the 36,600 acres of Marainanga marked the last of Murray Roberts & Co pastoral holdings, which had at one time reached 200,000 acres.

All of them were built during the reign of Felipe III, along with others located along the Mediterranean coast from Málaga to Catalonia. The purpose of these watchtowers was to warn the coastal population of the presence of Berber pirate ships, for which smoke signals and bonfires were used. At the top of each tower, there was always a bundle of dry wood to be burned immediately in case of danger, transmitting the alarm signal to the towers nearby. The Torre Nueva communicated visually with the Torre Nueva de Guadiaro and the Torre Carbonera. it is in a relatively good state of conservation, integrated with the beach of Playa de Torrenueva to which it gives its name. It is a circular tower in diameter and high, with a brick-domed interior room meters in diameter and high, which is accessed through a door located above the ground. In this room was a hearth for the guards of the tower, a secondary door that allowed ascent to the roof by means of a spiral staircase integrated into the walls, and a window. The roof has a parapet of a little more than a meter in height, in which a machicolation is located on the same level as the door, with scaffolds to its sides. This tower was capable of housing 5 men (4 soldiers and a corporal), and at its feet was stationed a guard corps consisting of a corporal and 6 soldiers of infantry and a corporal and 4 soldiers of cavalry.

He founded Grupo Cisneros.  Early life  Cisneros was born in Havana, Cuba, to parents Diego Jiménez de Cisneros y Govantes, a Cuban dentist, and María Luisa Bermúdez Martínez, who was from Venezuela. After his father's death in 1914, Cisneros and his mother and brother, Antonio José Cisneros, moved to Venezuela. They then moved to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where Cisneros' mother's family had relocated. While living in Trinidad, Cisneros attended primary and secondary school at Saint Mary's College, a school governed by the Roman Catholic Congregation of the Holy Ghost.  Career  In 1928, Cisneros and his brother Antonio José Cisneros moved back to Venezuela. In Caracas, Cisneros got a job at the Royal Bank of Canada because he was fluent in English. Shortly after getting that job, he began working at a dealership for Chrysler cars and International trucks. In 1929, Cisneros and his brother founded D. Cisneros & Cia, a small material- transport business. The brothers then obtained a license to operate a bus route and transformed the dump truck business into a bus business. In time, the Cisneros brothers created a bus line made up of 400 buses. In 1939, the Cisneros brothers sold the bus line. In 1939, D. Cisneros & Cia. began working with franchising rights in Venezuela, selling REO trucks, Hamilton Watch Company watches, and Norge appliances. In 1940, the Cisneros brothers got the exclusive franchise to produce and sell Pepsi-Cola products in Venezuela.In 1944, D. Cisneros & Cia. founded Liquid Carbonic, a company that produced carbon dioxide and related products. In 1947, they became the exclusive representative for Studebaker cars in Venezuela. In 1952, Cisneros founded Helados Club Ice Cream Company, later known as Helado Tio Rico, S.A., a Venezuelan ice cream business. In 1953, the various businesses were integrated into one entity, incorporating both commercial and industrial activities, Grupo Cisneros. The 1958 fall of Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez, created many economic setbacks. This included one of Televisa's investments in Venezuela, Televisa (Venezuela) aka Televisión Venezolana Independiente SA, which went into bankruptcy. In 1960, the President of Venezuela, Rómulo Betancourt, proposed that Cisneros purchase Televisa. Cisneros purchased Televisa, and began airing channel 27 on February 27, 1961, resuming uninterrupted transmissions on March 1, 1961. Cisneros re-branded Televisa (Venezuela) as Venevisión on 27 February 1961. One of the last actions undertaken by Cisneros was the creation of the Cisneros Foundation in 1968, a non-profit organization whose objective is to support democratic values, stimulate private initiative and promote free market values. In 1970, Diego Cisneros retired from the administration of the Cisneros Organization, then known as Diego Cisneros Organization, due to health problems.  Personal life  In 1938, Cisneros married Albertina Rendíles Martínez Cisneros. They had 8 children: Diego Alberto Cisneros, Marión Cisneros, Carlos Enrique Cisneros, Grupo Cisneros' Gustavo Cisneros, Ricardo José Cisneros, Gerardo Javier Cisneros, Antonio José Cisneros, and Ana Cisneros. He had 2 additional children with Virginia Igonda: Vilma Susana Cisneros and Gabriel Marcelo Cisneros.

He used 'Ghar' (Home) as a peg and strung together 238 four lines verses embracing a wide variety of subjects and ideas and feelings into a long poem. He is also the youngest poet in the history of Sahitya Akademi to have received this honour. Viyogi is noted for introducing the sonnet, a relatively new and unexplored genre for Dogri writers, into Dogri literature.  Early life  Kunwar Viyogi was born on 4 September 1940 in the Samba district to Poorakh Singh Jamwal, who served as an inspector in the J&K; Police Department. His mother, Pushpa Devi, was a home maker, and mother to five brothers and three sisters. Viyogi was the eldest. Most of Viyogi's siblings served the country by either joining the army or the air force. All his sisters were married to defence officers. Viyogi's childhood was not tied to one place owing to his father's occupation. He grew up in Gaur Bajorian, Rajouri, Buddal, Kotli (presently in Pakistan), Jammu and Udhampur. He spent a major part of his life in Jammu's Fattu Chogan area and was inspired by poetry at the age of 13. He achieved acclaim for his work published in the magazines Khilona and Shamaa, contributing short stories.  Academic life  Viyogi received his primary education from primary schools in Gaur, Sarore and Pacca Danga. His middle level education was from the princely school Partap Memorial Rajput School in Jammu. He later joined the G.G.M. Science College for higher studies. His interest in studies led him to pursue BSc, PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma of Management), PGDMC (Post Graduate Diploma of Mass Communication), MBA (Master of Business Administration) and post graduation in Journalism. Kunwar Viyogi was proficient in Dogri, Urdu, Hindi, English and Punjabi. His hobbies included playing football and hockey and he actively participated in the events of the student union. Profession While pursuing his graduation, Viyogi applied for the Defense ForcesArmy, Navy, and the Air Forceand was selected for all three. He opted for the Air Force and joined the Air Force Flying College for training as a pilot. The nature of his job took him across India and he served as a Squadron Leader in New York for about one and a half years. Though Viyogi excelled as an Air Force officer, he took premature retirement due to the demise of his wife who lost her life to breast cancer. He withdrew from the life that he had known with her, moved to Bhilwara, Rajasthan, and gave up all his literary musings. He then devoted his time in training students pursuing IAS and MBA. In 1992, Viyogi returned to Jammu and joined Kashmir Times as the editor of the Dogri edition. He wrote editorials, essays and poems. He again retreated to Rajasthan. In 2001, Viyogi was conferred the Sahitya Ratan Award by the Nami Dogri Sanstha for his invaluable contribution to Dogri. From 2012-15, he worked to publish and reprint his work. Major works Dogri-Ghar – A long poem,1979 in Rubaiyat Viyogi wrote ‘Ghar’ (Home) in the year 1980. He used ‘Ghar’ as a peg and strung together 238 four lines verse embracing a wide variety of subjects and ideas and feelings into a long poem. Dogri-Pehliyaan Banga – A sonnet sequence of 200 sonets,1987 Viyogi created his original masterpiece, Pehliyaan Banga, a book of 200 Dogri sonnets at a time when this form of poetry was unheard of in Dogri and was considered specific to European literature. A stream that attempted to introduce new and uninhibited form of literature, Pehliyaan Banga was the poet's attempt to rid the language of its claustrophobic garb. ENGLISH—Vol. 1-- Rosary of Sonnets (collections 0f 365 sonnets) The year 2018 saw publication of Viyogi's work in English, Rosary of Sonnets, a two-volume anthology of more than 300 sonnets.

The project is designed and implemented by the Institute for Research on the History of Children’s Literature in Iran. Read with Me was started as a pilot project in 2010 in a marginal area of south-east Tehran close to brick kilns where some 120 Afghan families lived. Since then, the project has been expanded to 19 provinces in Iran covering over 60,000 children and young adults and more than 2500 teachers, preschool tutors or volunteers. The project is funded by donations and mainly run by volunteers. In 2016, a group of tutors from Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan joined the project covering about 1000 children in this city and nearby villages.  The Course of Action  Quality books suitable for children, based on their age-group, literacy level, cultural and social condition, are selected and packed in book-bags. In every package or bag, there are handbooks for the teachers or interested parents to guide them. Two-day training workshops are organized every 3 months for teachers, librarians, and volunteers. Reading aloud sessions are held in classes. Teachers encourage discussion and exchange of views about the story, aiming to develop critical thinking. Reading sessions are accompanied by related art and craft activities, with an emphasis on role- playing and drama. To monitor and improve the implementation, all activities are documented for further evaluation of the project.
