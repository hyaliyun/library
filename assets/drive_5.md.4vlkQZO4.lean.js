Life He was born in Kirkcaldy, Fifeshire, about 1775. After being educated at the parish school he was trained as a gardener, and having filled several posts in Scotland went to Ireland in 1803. He visited the west of the island in 1804 and 1805, and as a result published a 'Catalogue of the Rarer Plants of Ireland' in the Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society for the following year. This catalogue he enlarged into the 'Catalogue of the Indigenous Plants of Ireland,' published in 1825 in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, which was again the basis of his Flora Hibernica, published in 1836, the cryptogamic portion of which was by Drs. Harvey and Taylor. The governors of Trinity College, Dublin, having determined to establish a botanical garden, Mackay was recommended to them as a curator, and he held the post from 1806 until his death. Soon after his appointment he was elected an associate of the Linnean Society, and in 1850 the university of Dublin bestowed upon him the degree of LL.D. He was attacked by paralysis about 1860, and died of bronchitis in Dublin 25 February 1862. Mackay discovered several species of plants new to the British Isles, and contributed largely to Sir J. E. Smith's English Botany (1790-1814). His herbarium is preserved at Trinity College Dublin. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to perpetuate his name, which is now borne by a genus of seaweeds, Mackaya, so named by Dr. Harvey, and by a species of heather, Erica mackayana.

The international cast stars George Peppard, George Hamilton, Horst Buchholz, Anny Duperey, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Ray Lovelock, Sam Wanamaker, and Capucine. The screenplay by frequent Lenzi collaborators Gianfranco Clerici and Jos√© Luis Mart√≠nez Moll√° is based on a story co-authored by the director. The film was a co-production between Italy, Spain, and France. The plot follows a group of six friends of different nationalities who are forced apart on different sides during World War II. It depicts a number of historical wartime episodes including the Battle of Dunkirk and the Liberation of Paris.FROM HELL TO VICTORY \\"(De l'enfer √† la victoire)\\" Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 46, Iss. 540, (Jan 1, 1979): 226.  Plot  On August 24, 1939, six friends take drinks in a suburb of Paris; Americans Brett Rosson and Ray MacDonald, the French Maurice Bernard and Fabienne Bodin, German J√ºrgen Dietrich, and Englishman Dick Sanders. Despite the looming threat of war, the six resolve to meet again annually at this same location. Soon, Germany invades Poland, and the six are forced to go their separate ways. Less than a year later, Germany conquers France. Dick and Maurice narrowly survive the evacuation of Dunkirk, whereupon Maurice promptly joins the Free French Forces while Dick is assigned to a new RAF unit. Fabienne has joined a French resistance cell, Ray is embedded in the RAF command as a war correspondent, and J√ºrgen is an officer in the German occupation force. Brett‚Äôs estranged son Jim enlists in the US Army, intent on becoming a commando. Brett, an agent with Office of Strategic Services, is initially ambivalent about Jim‚Äôs decision, but eventually decides to put in his requested recommendation, hoping it‚Äôll help them reconnect. Maurice and Ray briefly reunite in London, where Ray is living with his daughter Mary, a WAAF officer, and the two wonder where the rest of their group is, and whether they‚Äôll ever be able to reunite. Fabienne and J√ºrgen invariably meet when he saves from arrest by the Gestapo. The two make love, but Fabienne maintains that the two cannot be together because their countries are enemies, much to J√ºrgen‚Äôs disappointment. Meanwhile, Jim is dispatched with his unit behind enemy lines to sabotage German supply lines, a mission that leads to his meeting Maurice. The operation is successful, but the rest of the unit is killed in the process, and Jim and Maurice are forced into hiding with local partisans. They‚Äôre smuggled to the ch√¢teau of Nicole Levin, an old flame of Brett‚Äôs and partisan sympathizer. Nicole hopes she and Brett might meet again, but her hopes are cut short when SS arrive to arrest Nicole on suspicion of her guerrilla activities. Nicole gives Jim his father‚Äôs old cigarette case and asks him to speak to Brett for her. As Maurice and Jim hide in the cellar, Nicole is killed along with her servants when they try to intervene. Meanwhile in the skies above London, Dick is shot down and killed defending the city from the Blitz, only hours after briefly reuniting with Brett. The elder receives his cigarette case along with a letter from Jim, who expresses a desire to spend more time with him once the war is over. In the lead up to the D-Day invasion, Brett successfully leads a mission in Nazi-occupied Holland to destroy a V-2 rocket manufacturing plant, significantly damaging German defensive capabilities and ensuring a successful invasion. Ray is unable to accompany his daughter to the front due to medical treatment for his complications from his alcoholism, but manages to come to terms with both it and part on good terms with Mary. Fabienne, meanwhile, bombs a German base, calling J√ºrgen beforehand to meet her across the street to spare him. She‚Äôs subsequently found out and arrested trying to escape. In the final Allied push for Paris, three of the friends unknowingly cross paths as American infantry skirmish with German panzer units commanded by J√ºrgen. Maurice and Jim fend off the tanks on the ground as Brett and his OSS men call in air support from a nearby hill. Despite J√ºrgen‚Äôs attempt to rush the American trenches and overwhelm them, the arrival of reinforcements overwhelms his panzers. Brett unknowingly kills J√ºrgen by firing on his command tank with a bazooka, and Jim is mortally wounded by a stray explosion. He dies with his father and Maurice by his side. Paris is successfully liberated on August 24, freeing Fabienne from prison. Brett and Maurice arrive, alone, to the same spot they‚Äôd met five years prior. Brett offers a toast to Dick, Ray, J√ºrgen, and Fabienne, when the latter arrives on foot. The three embrace, together at last.  Cast  Production The screenplay is credited to Anthony Fritz, while the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that some sources credits Umberto Lenzi, Gianfranco Clerici and Jose Luis Martinez Molls. Some internationally distributed versions credit Umberto Lenzi under the pseudonym \\"Hank Milestone\\". Exterior filming locations include Paris and Spain, with interiors at Cinecitt√† Studios. The opening sequence was shot in Casa de Campo park in Madrid. The film also uses stock footage from several other Euro War films, including Eagles Over London and The Inglorious Bastards. Reception The Monthly Film Bulletin noted that they had to \\"admire the resourcefulness of a relatively low-budget production which still runs to a quite respectable crowd of extras and such details as a genuine vintage fire engine in the London blitz scene\\" and that \\"taken on the level of a ripping yarn, From Hell to Victory is really quite amiable, although the routine script and direction make everything much more predictable than it need have been\\".

Since the platform for collections of Internet memes was launched on July 1, 2008, it has grown in popularity across the social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. History The website was co-founded in 2009‚Äì2010 by a group of five Hong Kong people: University of Hong Kong student Ray Chan, his brother Chris Chan, Derek Chan, Marco Fung, and Brian Yu, with the intention of creating an alternative online platform to email on which users could easily share humorous photos or videos. In a 2012 interview, its CEO Ray Chan declined to explain the origins of the name \\"9GAG\\". Starting the company under a \\"Just for Fun\\" mentality, 9GAG's co- founders began using 9GAG as a r√©sum√©-builder for the 500 Startups accelerator program. During the summer program, the 9GAG team worked on other startup ideas, including StartupQuote and Songboard. Following the 500 Startups accelerator program, 9GAG participated in Y Combinator's incubator and its user-base increased to 70 million global unique visitors per month. The 9GAG co-founding team discontinued all other projects and shifted their focus exclusively on 9GAG. 500 Startups was given equity for their aid and mentorship. In July 2012, 9GAG raised an additional US$2.8 million in funding from Silicon Valley-based venture capital, including True Ventures and Greycroft Partners. In August 2012, 9GAG received another US$2.8 million in funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including True Ventures and Greycroft Partners, as well as individual investors like Christopher Sacca, Kevin Rose, and Naval Ravikant. This funding was able to support 9GAG's engineering team growth both in Hong Kong and in Silicon Valley. 9GAG is headquartered in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong with offices in Mountain View, California.  Mobile app development  9GAG has a mobile application on iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8, and BlackBerry 10.http://9gag.tv/ In July 2012, 9GAG launched an app for iOS and Android. The mobile application serves as a streamlined version of the web-based content. In summer 2014 9GAG launched 9CHAT. 9GAG users are able to log into their account and write to others by sending them a message. 9CHAT also added support for the creation of groups in different sections. January 2015, 9GAG launched its first game called 9GAG Redhead redemption. Content and authorship 9GAG users and admins may also re-post content (usually without any consent from its respective authors) from other websites (e.g. 4chan, Newgrounds, Reddit, SomethingAwful, FunnyJunk, YTMND, Instagram, etc.), replacing the source site's watermark with their own. In 2011, 9GAG and 4chan disputed authorship of internet memes published on both websites, whereby each company claimed the memes originated from their own website. As stated by 9GAG co-founder Ray Chan, \\"9GAG does not create memes or rage comics, but helps spread them.\\" In a 2015 Slate article, writer Amanda Hess described 9GAG's reposting of content from Instagram as part of an \\"online ecosystem of joke stealing\\". In his 2014 article \\"Building Identity and Building Bridges Between Cultures: The Case of 9gag\\", the linguist Albin Wagener examined 446 posts found on 9GAG's main page; of these, 40 (8.97%) were clearly discriminatory. Most of the discriminatory posts were misogynist (57.5%), followed by cultural discrimination (25%) and homophobia (12.5%). According to Wagener, 9GAG brings people together in an international context, but through masculine and heterosexual symbolism and the devaluation of other groups.

On January 28, 1980, 18-year-old Flores stayed aboard the USCGC Blackthorn as it was sinking following a collision with a tanker, Capricorn, and helped save twenty-three (23) of his crewmates, at the cost of his own life. Flores threw life jackets to seamen struggling in the water without life jackets. He strapped the life jacket locker open, so remaining life jackets would be released as the vessel sank. He then tried to aid wounded seamen who were still aboard. The collision has been described as the worst peacetime disaster in the Coast Guard's history. Honors In 2000, twenty years after the collision, Flores was formally honored for his bravery. Flores was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal.

They first journeyed to Santa Fe, New Mexico from Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1739. First expedition Pierre Antoine Mallet (b. 20 June 1700, d. after 1750) and his brother Paul Mallet (b. ?, d. 1753, Arkansas Post, Arkansas), were born in Montreal, Canada and moved to Detroit in 1706 and Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1734. From Kaskaskia, in 1739, they attempted to travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico with six companions and nine horses loaded with trade goods. They followed the Missouri River north to South Dakota to the villages of the Arikara. It was believed at the time that the Missouri River flowed all the way to the Spanish colonies in New Mexico. Told by the Indians that New Mexico was to the southwest, they backtracked to the Pawnee villages on the Loup River in Nebraska. From there on May 29, 1739, they embarked for Santa Fe. The Mallet‚Äôs account of their journey to Santa Fe was lost and their route can only be roughly approximated. They followed the Platte and South Platte River, which they called the River of the Padoucas (Padoucas probably refers to the Apache Indians who had inhabited this area a few years earlier). They followed the South Platte upstream to approximately the Colorado-Nebraska border, then turned south. While crossing a river (probably the Republican), they lost seven horses loaded with merchandise. They reached the Arkansas River near the Kansas-Colorado line and followed it upstream. On July 5, probably near present-day La Junta, Colorado they encountered a village of ‚ÄúLaitane‚Äù Indians (Comanche). Among the Comanche was an Arikara Indian slave whom they hired as a guide to lead them to Santa Fe. He led them, probably following a route approximating the later Santa Fe Trail to Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico where they first met Spaniards and were ‚Äúpleasantly received.‚Äù They proceeded onward to Santa Fe where they proposed opening trade relations between New Mexico and the French. After a nine-month wait in Santa Fe, the response from the government in Mexico City was negative and they were told they had to leave. However, they were given letters encouraging trade by New Mexican officials.‚ÄúMallet Brothers.‚Äù Encyclopedia of the Great Plains. http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ea.026, accessed 1 Dec 2011 On May 1, 1740, the Mallets and their party left Santa Fe to return east. One of their men married a Spanish woman and remained in New Mexico. Three men split off to return to Illinois via the same route they had followed to New Mexico; the Mallets and two others followed the Canadian River eastwards from New Mexico through the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma. En route they encountered a Comanche village and traded knives and other items for horses. Later, probably in Oklahoma, they encountered several Padoucas (Apache) who were frightened of them, possibly because of experience with slavers. Downstream, when the Canadian became navigable, the Mallets abandoned their horses and made canoes and on June 24 they arrived at the junction of the Canadian and Arkansas Rivers and found there a hunting party of French Canadians. By boat they proceeded down the river to Arkansas Post and hence to New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving in March 1741.‚ÄúExtract of the Journal of the Expedition of the Mallet Brothers to Santa Fe, 1739-1740.‚Äù www.americanjourneys.org/aj-092/summary/index.asp, accessed 1 Dec 2011 Second expedition Although the Mallet‚Äôs first expedition had been a commercial failure, the French sent out a second, and larger, trade expedition to New Mexico. Andre Fabry de la Bruyere, a government official in New Orleans, was appointed to lead the expedition which left New Orleans in September 1741. The Mallet brothers and several other voyageurs and one Negro slave accompanied him. Fabry proceeded by boat up the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers to the Canadian and then with agonizing slowness up the Canadian to the junction of the Little River near present-day Holdenville, Oklahoma. There he met a war party of 35 Osage who were in search of their Mento (Wichita) enemies. The river being unnavigable, Fabry attempted unsuccessfully to buy horses from the Osage and other tribes to continue the journey. In September 1742 he abandoned the expedition. The Mallets meanwhile, apparently disgusted with Fabry‚Äôs leadership, had departed on foot for Santa Fe. They were also unsuccessful and turned back to Arkansas Post where they lived during the 1740s.

Cooper, p.72 The batoning method can be used to make kindling or desired forms such as boards, slats or notches. The practice is most useful for obtaining dry wood from the inside of logs for the purpose of fire making. Tools Tools used in batoning are: a strong, fixed-blade, preferably full tang knife or machete with a thick spine, and a club-sized length of dense or green wood for striking the knife's spine and tip. Technique The basic method involves repeatedly striking the spine of the knife to force the middle of the blade into the wood. The tip is then struck, to continue forcing the blade deeper, until a split is achieved.McCann, John D.. Stay Alive: Survival Skills You Need. Krause Publications (24 Oct 2011). Uses and advantages This technique is useful for the simple splitting of wood for kindling, to access dry wood within a wet log, and for the production of shingles, slats, or boards. It is also useful for cutting notches, or making clean crosscuts against the grain of the wood. The technique is also especially useful when a chopping tool is not available. Hazards Care must be taken to avoid damage to the knife. Breakage of the blade is a common result of striking the spine of the knife at an angle. If this happens the broken blade can become irretrievably embedded within the split. In a survival situation, this can be catastrophic.

Born in Johannesburg, South Africa and later living in Britain, Finkelstein is known as a pioneer of the social model of disability and a key figure in developing the understanding the oppression of disabled people.  Biography   Early life  Vic Finkelstein grew up in Durban, South Africa. He studied at The University of Natal, Durban and Pietermaritzburg, before taking a Masters in psychology at Witwaterstrand University in Johannesburg.The Independent: Vic Finkelstein Obituary https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/vic-finkelstein-academic- anddisability-activist-6277679.html During this time he became involved with anti-apartheid activism. In the 1960s, Finkelstein was imprisoned for his anti-apartheid activities. Following a spell of hard labour, he was issued with a five-year banning order (1967‚Äì1972) under the Suppression of Communism Act. Finkelstein came to the UK in 1968 as a refugee and joined the emergent British disability movement.A Personal Journey Into Disability Studies, by Vic Finkelstein. Retrieved 2nd Dec 2011. Finkelstein cites his first hand experiences witnessing apartheid and his treatment by South African police as a disabled person, as experiences that initiated new ways of thinking about society and its oppression of disabled people. In the UK in 1972 Finklestein co-founded Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) with Paul Hunt.Vic Finkelstein: Founder of the Social Model of Disability, by Rhian Davies. Retrieved 2 Dec 2011 UPIAS was the first organisation to reject 'compensatory' and tragic or medical approaches to disability. As an alternative, UPIAS developed attention to the social and structural barriers that oppress people with impairments, rendering them 'disabled'. This led to the development of the social model of disability.  Academic career  Finkelstein was a tutor in disability studies at the Open University and later visiting senior research fellow in the Centre for Disability Studies Leeds University. Vic‚Äôs ideas influenced and inspired a generation of disabled activists and gave rise to the development of the Disabled People‚Äôs Movement through the formation of Centres for Independent Living,Grove Road Housing Scheme http://historyof.place/location/grove-road-housing-scheme/ Coalitions of Disabled People and disability arts groups.

In reflection seismology, a bright spot is a local high amplitude seismic attribute anomaly that can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons and is therefore known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. It is used by geophysicists in hydrocarbon exploration. History Bright spots were not commonly identified until the early 1970s because of the extensive and industry-wide use of automatic gain control, which obscured the amplitude effects of hydrocarbon accumulations. Theory A bright spot primarily results from the increase in acoustic impedance contrast when a hydrocarbon (with a lower acoustic impedance) replaces the brine-saturated zone (with a higher acoustic impedance) that underlies a shale (with a higher acoustic impedance still), increasing the reflection coefficient. The effect decreases with depth because compaction for sands and shales occurs at different rates and the acoustic impedance relationship stated above will not hold after a certain depth/age. Below this depth, there will be a crossover of shale and sand acoustic impedances and a dim spot is more useful to hydrocarbon exploration. Caution The relationship between hydrocarbons and direct hydrocarbon indicators, such as bright spots, is not straightforward and not all bright spots are caused by the presence of hydrocarbons and therefore they should not be treated as conclusive evidence of hydrocarbon accumulations.

The short dramatic piece tells the story of two hungry thieves who devise a plan to con a simpleton out of his food by telling him about the fictional wonders of the Land of Jauja. While one tells the story the other steals the food until it is all gone. Plot The play opens with the two thieves, Honziguera and Panarizo reuniting. Honziguera is upset that Panarizo did not stay behind at the tavern to steal the money of the drunken patrons. Panarizo is upset that Honziguera left him at the tavern by himself with a large debt. To make matter worse, Panarizo left their weapon, a sword, behind. While Honziguera is scolding Panarizo about leaving the sword, Panarizo states that he is hungry, and tells Honziguera to give him something to eat. Honziguera responds that he is also hungry and that he is waiting around for a simpleton who passes by every day carrying food for his wife who is in jail. He has come up with a plan to trick this simpleton out of the food he is carrying, filling his own belly and his partner's in the process. Mendrugo, the simpleton, enters the scene mindlessly singing. Mendrugo is greeted by the two thieves, who ask him where he is going and why. Mendrugo tells them he is going to the jail to deliver some food to his wife. She is in jail for procuring. Panarizo asks Mendrugo if she was defended. He answers yes, and now they are getting a bishopric. He says his wife wants to rule, and that they will be rich. Mendrugo then asks Panarizo about the benefits of presiding over a bishopric. He tells him that they get lots of honey and old shoes. When Mendrugo hears this he gets excited about the \\"perks\\". When Mendrugo is asked why he is excited he responds that he wants to be the \\"obispeso\\" the bishop, the correct word being \\"obispo\\". Honziguera uses this opportunity to start the story of the fantastical Land of Jauja, and how Mendrugo should try to preside over this wonderful place instead. Mendrugo has never heard of the Land of Jauja and sits to hear of its many wonders. Some of these wonders include slapping men for working, trees with trunks of bacon, and talking food that begs to be eaten. As one thief captures Mendrugo's attention with \\"facts\\" of Jauja, the other eats food out of the simpleton's stew pot. Some versions leave Mendrugo engrossed in the story, never realizing that Jauja is not a real place or that his food is being taken from under his nose. Other versions end with Mendrugo realizing that the thieves have left him with nothing more than an empty pot. Characters Honziguera - The thief that devises the plan to tell the simpleton the story of the Land of Jauja, and steal his food. Panarizo - The other thief that goes along with Honziguera's plan. Mendrugo - He is the simpleton that takes food to his wife in prison every day. He gets conned by the two thieves during the telling of the \\"Land of Jauja\\". Wife of Mendrugo - She is mentioned briefly, but is never shown and does not have a speaking role. She is in jail for procuring. Commedia dell'arte After being trained as a gold beater, Lope de Rueda led a theater troupe using the style and influence of an Italian movement called Commedia dell'arte. He wrote several full length plays using this style, but he is more famous for the short works which he called, pasos. These pasos are characterized as having stock characters, containing every day situations, and broad humor. The pasos were generally performed during the intermission of full length plays, and served as entertainment for all social classes. Stock Characters represented in La tierra de Jauja *Bobo, simpleton - This character is usually a servant, the butt of the ridicule, causing enjoyment due to his stupidity and ignorance. Generally, his only goal is to fill his stomach. *Gracioso - This character is often seen as a clown or a fool, but is also intelligent and wise. He plays the opposite of the Bobo, and generally gets the upper hand. The Land of Jauja Fictional Jauja Jauja goes by several different names such as Xauja, Pa√≠s de Cuca√±a, Cockaigne, and others. Jauja is a fictional land somewhere in the Americas. People in Spain, during the 16th and 17th century, would dream about this land where everything is good, much like the way people dream of Atlantis. Many people believed that in this land there was no need to work. The reason for the myths about Jauja came from the tales of the wealth and the good fortune of the conquistadores in the actual town of Jauja in Peru. There were many writings about this mysterious, glorious land. This is an expert of a poem about Cockaigne: ::Far out to sea and west of Spain ::There is a country named Cockaygne. ::No place on earth compares to this ::For sheer delightfulness and bliss. ::Though Paradise is fair and bright, ::Cockaygne is a finer sight. ::In Paradise what's to be seen ::But grass and flowers and branches green? ::Though paradisal joys are sweet, ::There's nothing there but fruit to eat; ::No bench, no chamber, and no hall, ::No alcoholic drink at all. ::Its inhabitants are few, ::Elijah, Enoch---just the two; ::They must find it boring there ::Without more company to share. ::But Cockaygne offers better fare, ::And without worry, work, or care; Jauja, Peru Jauja, Peru was established 1534 by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He wanted to keep the Quechua name of the town \\"Xauxa\\". Pizarro found out that Jauja had a great deal of provisions such as food, clothing, and wealth and became a major city in Peru. Also, the dry climate of Jauja was easy on those with respiratory problems, and because of this there was a large hospital that tended to many Spaniards. Modern Stories of Jauja Pa√≠s de Jauja - This is a Spanish Language novel written in 1993 by Edgardo Rivera Mart√≠nez. This story is set in the 1940s, the protagonist is a teenage boy who is an aspiring writer and musician. One summer he learns a lot about his family history and the story of Jauja. This fictional novel combines history and myth. La Utop√≠a Arcaica. Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas y Las Ficciones Del Indigenismo - This book is Spanish language written by Mario Vargas Llosa in 1996. This book is about factual events and does not deal with the mythical side of Jauja, Peru. Vargas Llosa feels that it is important to give the actual historic details.

The company which operates the venue carries the same name. The Zagreb Fair is the main venue in Zagreb for trade shows and fairs. Every year more than 25 specialised events are held at the venue, attended by more than 6,000 participants from 50 countries. Apart from trade fairs it is also used as a convention center. History History of trade fairs in Zagreb dates back to 1242 when the Hungarian king Bela IV issued a Golden Bull declaring Zagreb a free royal city and granting it the right to hold fairs. The first international exhibition in Zagreb was held in 1864. Zagreb Assembly (), the predecessor to Zagreb Fair, was founded by a group of Croatian businessmen, including Ferdinand Budicki and Samuel David Alexander. The Assembly was one of the co-founding institutions of The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry in 1925. In June of 1941 the Croatian fascist, ultranationalist Usta≈°e regime established a transit camp for Jews in the Fairgrounds. Most were placed in what used to be the French Pavilion and 2 neighboring ones. From there, in June-August 1941 the Usta≈°e shipped 2,500 Jews to the Usta≈°e death camps at Gospiƒá-Jadovno-Pag Island (because this was a highly visible location in the center of town, the Usta≈°e later replaced the transit camp with the more remote Zavratnica transit camp in eastern Zagreb, from which Jews were shipped to Jasenovac). Today the old Fairgrounds is the site of the University of Zagreb Student Center, At the ascent of the communist regime, in 1946, Zagreb Assembly was disbanded and its property and role was taken over by the newly incorporated Zagreb Fair. The Zagreb Fair was also the first fair held in post-World War II Yugoslavia in 1947.Kraljeviƒá & Arƒçabiƒá 2007, p. 157 In 1956 it was relocated to the newly constructed Novi Zagreb part of the city south of the river Sava.

Biography Hazairin was born in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, Dutch East Indies on 28 November 1906 to a strict religious family of Persian descent. His father, Zakaria Bahar, was a teacher from Bengkulu and his mother was of Minangkabau descent. As a child, he moved to Bengkulu to begin his schooling at a Hollands Indlandsche School, or Dutch school for Native Indonesians. After graduating in 1920, he moved to Padang to study at a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs, graduating in 1924. During the same period, he studied Arabic and the Quran with his grandfather, expanding on his Islamic studies in his own time. Hazairin later left for Bandung, in West Java, to study at the Algemene Middelbare School there, graduating in 1927. He then went to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) to study at the Institute of Law (Rechtkundige Hoogeschool), focusing on adat law. He graduated in 1935. After graduation, Hazairin returned to Bengkulu under the tutelage of B. Ter Haar, a respected Dutch expert on adat, to study the Rejang people there. Using the results as the basis for his dissertation, entitled \\"De Redjang\\" (\\"The Rejang\\"), he received a doctorate on 29 May 1936. He was the only native Indonesian doctor to graduate from the Batavia Institute of Law. From 1935 until 1938 he also served as a guest lecturer at the institution. In 1938 Hazairin obtained a post at a court in Padang Sidempuan, North Sumatra, where he stayed until the Japanese invaded the Indies in 1942; during the same period he served to enforce adat law throughout South Tapanuli. Throughout the Japanese occupation, he served as one of their legal advisers. After Indonesia's independence in 1945, Hazairin served as chief justice of the South Tapanuli court. He also served on the Central Indonesian National Committee. In 1946, he was promoted to regent (residen) of Bengkulu, also becoming the Vice Military Governor of South Sumatra; during his time as regent, he released his own currency to bolster the faltering economy of the region. In 1948, he served as head of the Great Indonesia Party (Partai Indonesia Raya), an offshoot of the Indonesian National Party, which he had helped found. In 1950 Hazairin returned to Jakarta, becoming a lecturer on adat and Islamic law at the University of Indonesia. In early 1953 he served as the head of the Civil / Criminal Law Division at the Ministry of Justice. He later was selected as Minister of Internal Affairs for the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, serving from 30 July 1953 to 18 November 1954. During his term, he helped pass a law guaranteeing inheritance rights to children born out of wedlock and unmarried live-together partners. He later served in the Ministry of Justice, retiring in 1959. After retiring from politics, Hazairin founded the Wakaf Foundation of Islamic Higher Learning (Yayasan Wakaf Perguruan Tinggi Islam, later the Islamic University of Jakarta Foundation) in Jakarta, later serving as the rector of its university. Beginning in 1960 until his death on 11 December 1975, he served as president of Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. He also taught at the Jakarta School of Policing (Perguruan Tinggi Ilmu Kepolisian). Views Hazairin wrote extensively on marriage law in relation to Islam, and is considered a moderate. He saw Islam as having a bilateral marriage system; in other words, not matrilineal and not patrilineal. He based this opinion on three things. Firstly, he read Sura An-Nisa verses 23 and 24 as allowing cousin marriages, which in his opinion showed support for the bilateral system. Secondly, he noted that verse 11 of Sura An-Nisa allowed inheritances to both sons and daughters; he believed that a patrilineal society would only allow sons to inherit wealth. Finally, verses 12 and 176 of Sura An-Nisa allowed all siblings to share equally in the inheritance. Legacy For his work in South Tapanuli, Hazairin was given the title Gelar Pangeran Alamsyah Harahap. The government awarded him several medals, including the Bintang Satya Lencana Widya Satia, the Bintang Gerilya, the Bhayangkara Kelas III, and the Bintang Kartika Eka Paksi Kelas III. Hazairin University in Bengkulu is named after him. Personal life Hazairin was a polyglot, fluent in Dutch, Indonesian, English, and French, with a passive comprehension of Arabic, Latin, and German. Selected works Hazairin published 17 works regarding adat and Islamic law, with those about adat noting the diversity found in Indonesia, and those on Islamic law pushing for an amalgamation of Islamic and secular law.

Alternative formulations are \\"discrete infinity\\" and \\"the infinite use of finite means\\". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits‚Äîirreducible atomic sound elements‚Äîare combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. Frontispiece and title page of the Dialogue Noam Chomsky cites Galileo as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is \\"the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts\\". In his Dialogo, Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's \\"most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper.\\" \\"This is the greatest of all human inventions,\\" Galileo continues, noting it to be \\"comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo\\".  The computational theory of mind  'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's 'universal grammar' mechanism, conceived as a computational module inserted somehow into Homo sapiens otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition‚Äîcentral to the so-called 'cognitive revolution' of the 1950s and 1960s‚Äîis generally attributed to Alan Turing, who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. But his often forgotten conclusion however was in line with previous observations that a \\"thinking\\" machine would be absurd, since we have no formal idea what \\"thinking\\" is ‚Äî and indeed we still don't. Chomsky frequently pointed this. Chomsky agreed that while a mind can be said to \\"compute\\"‚Äîas we have some idea what computing is and some good evidence the brain is doing it on at least some level‚Äîwe cannot however claim that a computer or any other machine is \\"thinking\\" because we have no coherent definition of what thinking is. Taking the example of what's called 'consciousness,' Chomsky said that, \\"We don't even have bad theories\\"‚Äîechoing the famous physics criticism that a theory is \\"not even wrong.\\" From Turing's seminal 1950 article, \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\", published in Mind, Chomsky provides the example of a submarine being said to \\"swim.\\" Turing clearly derided the idea. \\"If you want to call that swimming, fine,\\" Chomsky says, repeatedly explaining in print and video how Turing is consistently misunderstood on this, one of his most cited observations. Previously the idea of a thinking machine was famously dismissed by Ren√© Descartes as theoretically impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In The Philosophical Writings of Descartes. Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it. Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made universal thinking machine‚Äîknown nowadays as a 'Turing machine'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since‚Äîexamined closely enough‚Äîits possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then functionally the machine may be considered 'digital': An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a binary digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the medium used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it does matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of digital computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages. Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes's celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) information on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical medium‚Äîlight, sound, electricity or whatever‚Äîchosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied‚Äîin the human case at least‚Äîthe existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. A digital apparatus Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with \\"mind\\". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably Hilary Putnam) took what seemed to be the next logical step‚Äîarguing that the human mind itself is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental \\"modules\\" are best understood that way. Noam Chomsky rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the natural mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly natural science. The human speech apparatus in sagittal sectionIn the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, \\"digital infinity\\" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, \\"voicing\\" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position‚Äîand you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as 'distinctive features' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath Roman Jakobson. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components‚Äîa set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. Chomsky's original work was in morphophonemics. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach‚Äînow hugely successful‚Äîfar beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist‚ÄîClaude L√©vi-Strauss‚Äîto apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky‚Äîwho got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle‚Äîhoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.Chomsky, N. 1965. Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127. If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device? This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of 'generative semantics'‚Äîthe proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' (+) position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' (-). The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives‚Äîirreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth‚Äîare genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties‚Äîsparking controversies culminating in the so-called 'linguistics wars' as described in Randy Allen Harris's 1957 publication by that name. OCLC summary: \\"When it was first published in 1957, Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structure seemed to be just a logical expansion of the reigning approach to linguistics. Soon, however, there was talk from Chomsky and his associates about plumbing mental structure; then there was a new phonology; and then there was a new set of goals for the field, cutting it off completely from its anthropological roots and hitching it to a new brand of psychology. Rapidly, all of Chomsky's ideas swept the field. While the entrenched linguists were not looking for a messiah, apparently many of their students were.\\" The linguistic wars attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of natural science. No part of the discipline‚Äînot even semantics‚Äîneed be \\"contaminated\\" any longer by association with such 'un- scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.Just as Bloomfield's mentalism was one way of keeping meaning away from form, by consigning it to psychology and sociology, so Chomsky's performance is a way to keep meaning and other contaminants away from form, by consigning them to \\"memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest\\" as well as to \\"the physical and social conditions of language , use\\" (1965 [1964]:3; 1977:3)‚Äîto psychology and sociology See also *Generative linguistics *Origin of language *Origin of speech *Recursion *Decoding Chomsky References Further reading *Knight, C. and C.

The station is funded by the USF Student Government, and the station office and on-air studio are in the university's Marshall Student Center. The station was started in 1988, and began its AM broadcasting in 1999. It began receiving funding in 2003. Programming Bulls Radio's original programming represents over a dozen genres of music as well as daily news and sports shows. Controversy Bulls Radio has been the subject of a few controversies since its inception. In June 2010, the USF Student Government President appointed Brett Farrar as the new director of Bulls Radio after an expedited interview process, despite having no previous experience at Bulls Radio or in the radio industry. Vocal opposition to the final USF Student Government Senate vote confirming Farrar's appointment was silenced when senators voted to remove \\"Open Forum\\" from the Senate Agenda during the following Senate meeting. In August 2010, anonymous grievances were filed against Farrar, student body President Cesar Hernandez and Vice President Spencer Montgomery, stating that they had \\"(broken) several statutes regarding executive branch confirmations on multiple occasions,\\" which amounted to a \\"total of 10 counts of nonfeasance.\\" In October, the USF Student Government Judiciary and Ethics Committee found that Student Government President Cesar Hernandez and the former Student Government Senate President Pro Tempore were in violation of two statutes when they hired new Student Government members over the summer, including the controversial appointment of Farrar.

The publication of the chronicles started in the February, No.2, 1869 issue of The Russian Messenger magazine, when Part 3 of it came out, under the title The Small People of Plodomasovo. Scenes From the Life of Old Russia. Then parts one, Boyarin Nikita Yurievich, and two, Boyarynya Marfa Andreevna, came out in Nos. 6,7 and 8,9 respectively, of the Syn Otechestva magazine. The Stories by M.Stebnitsky (1869) collection featured the Old Times in Plodomasovo under the title Three Studies, the third one being preceded by the author's commentary: \\"This one follows a large gap in the Plodomasovo chronicles, for three sketches on old years of Plodomasova and dvoryanin Tuganov's life were not included for some reasons. The following Study relates to the period when Marfa Andreevna has already been dead, the story of her later years is being told by her favourite 'midget' Nikolai Afanasievich. In 1872 The Small People of Plodomasovo were published again (with changes made in the text) as part of The Cathedral Clergy (The Russian Messenger, 1872, May), chapters II-IV of the Second Chronicle. Background Plodomasovo chronicles were first mentioned in the Literaturnaya Biblioteka magazine's list of acquisitions for the year 1858.Literaturnaya Biblioteka. December 1867, Book II. Alongside Bozhedomy (Godhouse Dwellers, later to be known as The Cathedral Clergy) here featured the Boyarynya Plodomasova story. Apparently, by the end of 1857 the chronicles have already been in the works. Leskov's original project was more fundamental than the one materialized. In 1871 he wrote: \\"I wanted to write some kind of a trilogy, first about a grandmother, Plodomasova, then her daughter Tuganova and later grand-daughter.\\"Gebel, Valentina. N. S. Leskov in His Literary Laboratory. Moscow, 1945, —Ä. 130. According to the author, the original idea was to show the course of the Russian history of the 18th and 19th centuries, \\"in its most lightweight, most superficial aspects, by telling life stories of some unimportant, small people who, nevertheless, by their lives to some extent epitomized the history of their time.\\"Kiyevskaya Starina, 1883, vol. V, February, —Ä. 235. The Preface to the \\"Pechersky Antics\\". The chronicles were based on Leskov's own childhood reminiscences, stories he had heard of ways and lives of different families of the Oryol Governorate, in the 1830s and 1840s. One episode concerning the marriage of 50-year-old Plodomasov and 15-year-old Marpha might have had bearings on his own family history. His aunt Natalya Petrovna Alferyeva in 1824 as a teenager became the wife to 50-year- old landowner Strakhov, who proved to be a jealous and tyrannical husband. Boyarynya Plodomasova herself had a prototype in a landowner woman Leskov related of in his article called \\"The Nobility Surfeit\\".–ü—Ä–µ—Å—ã—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é.

Only a handful of muster rolls, and almost no quartermaster or commissary reports, are known to exist.  Battles  When organized, Dobbins' regiment was listed as an unattached command in the District of Arkansas until May 1863. From June through September 1863 it was assigned to the Arkansas Cavalry Brigade of General Walker's Division, and in November 1863 listed as Dobbins' Cavalry Brigade, District of Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R.: \\"Two Ashley brothers in Dobbins' 1st Ark.

But for most of its existence, Dobbins' regiment was engaged in numerous scouts, raids and skirmishes throughout eastern and northeastern Arkansas. The companies frequently operated independently. Colonel Dobbins was court-martialed and dismissed from the service on November 23, 1863. The court martial resulted from Colonel Dobbins' refusal to accept orders from General John S. Marmaduke because Marmaduke had killed Brigadier General L. M. Walker in a duel just before the Battle of Little Rock.Massey, James Monroe,: \\"Dobbins' 1st Arkansas Cavalry, C. S. A.\\", Edward G.

Dyck (December 4, 1914 ‚Äì January 4, 2010) was a Canadian Mennonite relief worker and pastor best known for his work resettling Russian Mennonite refugees after World War II. Personal history Peter Dyck was born on December 4, 1914 in the Am Trakt Mennonite Settlement in Russia. He married Elfrieda Klassen on October 14, 1944 and they had two daughters, Ruth and Rebecca. He emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1927 with his family. They eventually settled in Tiefengrund, Saskatchewan. He was baptized in the Tiefengrund Rosenort Mennonite Church in 1934. He graduated from Rosthern Junior College and attended the University of Saskatchewan, but dropped out to pastor several struggling local churches. In 1949 he finished his education, studying at Goshen College, Bethel College, Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminaries, and Bethel Theological Seminay in Chicago, where he earned a Master of Divinity degree in 1968. He was called by Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) in 1941 to serve in England. There he assisted victims of World War II and met his future wife, who was serving as a nurse. Together they were asked to begin an MCC relief program for Mennonites fleeing the Soviet Union. The program was based in the Netherlands and escorted most of the refugees to Paraguay. In 1947, he was ordained as a minister of the Gospel, to give him authority in his spiritual guidance of Russian Refugees. Upon returning to the United States, Elfrieda and Peter embarked on a speaking tour, where they presented their story and films they had made to over 100,000 people. For many Mennonites it was the first time they viewed a film in a religious setting. Audiences were thrilled by their modern day exodus of Mennonite refugees from Berlin to the American zone of Germany, through the Soviet Occupied Zone. He served as a pastor, alongside his wife, at Eden Mennonite Church in Kansas and Kingview Mennonite Church in Pennsylvania. He held dual membership with the Mennonite church and the General Conference Mennonite Church. Peter served as MCC Director of Europe and North Africa from 1957 to 1967. Upon returning to the United States, Peter was the administrator of the MCC headquarters until 1981. Awards and honors Peter was knighted by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in 1950 for his relief work with refugees. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Waterloo in Ontario in 1974. He received Goshen College's Culture for Service Alumni Award in 1993.

Discovery and naming Life restoration Veterupristisaurus is known from the holotype specimen MB R 1938, an isolated middle caudal vertebra. Two partially fused posterior middle caudal vertebrae, MB R 2166, from the same locality as the holotype, are referred to this genus and most probably came from the same individual. The anterior caudal vertebra, MB R 1940, may also represent this genus. The holotype was collected in the St (EH) locality of the Tendaguru in German East Africa, from the Middle Dinosaur Member of the Tendaguru Formation, dating to the late Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian faunal stage of the Late Jurassic, about 154-150 million years ago. It was originally referred to Ceratosaurus? roechlingi by Werner Janensch in 1925. Veterupristisaurus was named by Oliver W. M. Rauhut in 2011 and the type species is Veterupristisaurus milneri. The generic name translates as \\"old shark lizard\\". It refers to the fact that Veterupristisaurus is currently the oldest known representative of the \\"shark-toothed lizards\\", the Carcharodontosaurids. The specific name honours the paleontologist Angela C. Milner. Description Size comparison Veterupristisaurus was a large bipedal animal. The length of the holotype vertebra is about , thus Veterupristisaurus has been estimated to have been about - in length, based on the more complete and closely related Acrocanthosaurus. There are teeth from Tendaguru Formation that probably come from it. In 2016 based on these teeth from the (MBHUK R6758) specimen of Tanzania that probably refers to the same species Molina- P√©rez and Larramendi gave a length of 12.6 meters (41.3 feet) and a weight of 6.4 tonnes (7 short tons). Whether the individual represented by the holotype represents an adult individual cannot be determined based on the available material. It is diagnosed by a spinoprezygapophyseal lamina in the middle caudal vertebrae extending anteriorly to the midwidth of the base of the prezygapophysis and being flanked laterally by a short, parallel lamina extending from the lateral margin of the prezygapophysis posteriorly. Thus, Rauhut considered a sister-group relationship between Veterupristisaurus and Acrocanthosaurus within the Carcharodontosauridae.

Haitian legal historian Mirlande Manigat refers to her as Euph√©mie Daguile. She is believed to have been Dessalines' most influential mistress. Life Daguilh met Dessalines in Les Cayes during his campaign in South Haiti, where she nursed him during his sickness. She followed Dessalines during his campaign against Santo Domingo and made her name respected when tending to the wounded soldiers during gunfight. Thomas Madiou has referred to her as a heroine. Euph√©mie Daguilh composed several songs which became popular in Haiti. Her relationship with Dessalines was public and a letter paper was printed with the text: \\"The Friend of Jacques, His Majesty Emperor of Haiti\\", and she was granted an allowance. Daguilh hosted a salon with the task to spy on the military of Southern Haiti. While Dessalines was still alive, her monthly expenses paid by the state were about 1000 gourdes. Upon complaints to Dessalines by Balthazar Inginac, Director of state properties for the West of Haiti, her allowance was reduced to 800 piastres. When Dessalines was deposed, a mob broke in her house with the intent to lynch her, but she managed to calm them by serving them dessert and singing her songs to them. She later married one of the prominent members of the Haitian military, Lacoude Bellefleur aka Bellefleur Laconde of which she had had children before her liaison with Dessalines.

Damage was reported throughout Davis County, and extending into Weber and Salt Lake counties, ranging from Ogden down to Salt Lake City. That morning Mayor Ron Russell of Centerville declared a local state of emergency. Due to the extensive damage, Davis County declared a state of emergency later that evening. The windstorm extended throughout the Western United States, with power outages and structural damage also reported in California and Nevada. Impact The storm occurred late in the fall season, so most of the trees damaged in the storm were evergreens. More than 400 trees were down at the Davis Golf course alone due to the winds. Thousands of residences were without power throughout the day and into the evening. At one point, as many as 54,000 residences were without power. Calls flooded into Rocky Mountain Power that day from customers trying to get updates on when their power would be restored. Many residences of the area had difficulties attempting to call friends and families with their cell phones because of the surge in communications in the area. The Utah Transit Authority shut down the FrontRunner commuter rail service between Layton and Salt Lake City due to damaged train stations, debris on the train tracks, and power outages. A \\"bus bridge\\" was used to ferry passengers between the Layton and Salt Lake Central stations while repairs were made. Even though FrontRunner service resumed by mid-afternoon, the Farmington Station remained closed through the weekend while repairs to the station were completed. Many schools in Davis School District were closed for the safety of the children and because many of the facilities were without power and damage to other schools in the district. Weber State University (WSU) also cancelled daytime classes at both its Ogden and Davis County campuses, with the Davis County campus remaining closed through the next day. Overall damages from the storm were estimated to be $20 million. The estimated cost of the cleanup from the storm was $8 million for Centerville alone. Some citizens were left without power for days, caused by winds uprooting trees and sending them crashing down into power lines. While no major injuries were reported due to the winds within Davis County, WSU reported that three of their students sustained minor injuries from being blown off their feet in parking lots or being hit by a door that was blown by the winds. The Utah Highway Patrol also reported several truck drivers suffered minor injuries as a result of their semi-trucks being blown over along the freeways. In addition there were injuries that resulted from the cleanup and repair efforts, including individuals who fell off roofs and broke arms and legs. One individual in Kaysville fell through a carport roof, broke several ribs and punctured a lung.

His father and grandfather, who were both named Thomas Penson, were also surveyors and architects. His grandfather Thomas Penson (c. 1760‚Äì1824) worked from an office in Wrexham, North Wales, and was responsible for the design of bridges, roads, gaols and buildings in North Wales. His son Thomas Penson (1790‚Äì1859) was county surveyor to a number of Welsh counties and also designed bridges. He later moved to Oswestry, Shropshire where he established an architectural practice. Thomas Mainwaring Penson was born in Oswestry, and was educated at Oswestry School. His elder brother was Richard Kyrke Penson who became a partner in the Oswestry practice in 1854, before developing an extensive architectural practice of his own, mainly in South Wales. Thomas Mainwaring Penson trained in his father's practice. Thomas Mainwaring initially designed buildings in the area of the practice, including stations for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. He was then appointed as County Surveyor of Cheshire and moved to Chester, Cheshire. Here he laid out Overleigh Cemetery in 1848‚Äì50. This has been designated by English Heritage at Grade II in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. He is credited with pioneering the Black-and-white Revival (vernacular or half- timbered) style in the city during the 1850s. His first building in this style was constructed in Eastgate Street in 1852, but it has since been demolished. His other notable buildings in Chester were designed both in Black-and-white Revival and in other styles. They include Crypt Chambers (1858) in Eastgate Street, which is in Gothic Revival style, Queen Hotel (1860‚Äì61) opposite Chester railway station, which is Italianate, and Grosvenor Hotel (1863‚Äì86) in Eastgate Street, which is constructed in a mixture of timber-framing, brick and stone.

He also played in the Southern League for Chelmsford City, Dartford, Cambridge United, Gravesend & Northfleet and Folkestone. Football career After spending time on the club's ground staff, Nicholas turned professional with First Division champions Chelsea in May 1955. He was capped by England at youth level: against a Denmark youth XI in October 1955, he scored three times in a 9‚Äì2 victory and, according to The Times' correspondent, \\"had a rare eye for the target and a left foot of great power\\". While stationed at RAF High Wycombe during his National Service, Nicholas represented the Royal Air Force football team, and helped his station to victory in the RAF Cup Final. He first played for Chelsea at 18, alongside Peter Brabrook, Ron Tindall, Les Allen and Frank Blunstone in a forward line with an average age of under 20. He played and scored in Chelsea's first appearance in European competition, against a Copenhagen XI in the first round of the 1958‚Äì60 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Although he scored regularly for Chelsea, he fell out with manager Ted Drake, and joined Brighton & Hove Albion in 1960 for a club record ¬£15,000 fee. He was Brighton's top scorer in the League in 1960‚Äì61, with 13 goals from 27 appearances, and his four goals in the last two games of the season made sure the club avoided relegation. He was Brighton's joint-top scorer, alongside Johnny Goodchild and Bobby Laverick, with 10 goals in all competitions, as the team failed to avoid relegation the following year. In Chris Westcott's book Upfront with Chelsea, Nicholas recalled how his request for a wage increase, when the first-team players were on ¬£20 a week, was turned down, and he went on to leave the Football League, aged just 24, for a wage of ¬£28 a week at Southern League club Chelmsford City. After a brief return to the Football League with Leyton Orient in the 1965‚Äì66 season, Nicholas returned to non-League football with Dartford, Cambridge United, with whom he won a Southern League Premier Division and Cup double in the 1968‚Äì69 season, Dartford again, Gravesend & Northfleet and Folkestone. He retired from professional football in 1973, but played for Great Baddow in the Essex Olympian League in the 1977‚Äì78 season. Personal life Nicholas was born in West Ham, Essex, in 1938. While still playing football, he trained as a cabinet-maker and opened a DIY shop in Chelmsford. This developed into a successful interior design business which he passed on to sons Tony and Kevin. He and wife Darlene were keen golfers. In later life, Nicholas was treated for leukaemia. He died in a London hospital in September 2005 at the age of 67.

The site itself was destroyed by the construction of Carters Dam in the 1970s. With respect to the dam itself, Bell Field was located in front of the high dam along with the Sixtoe Mound and Little Egypt sites. Excavation history Excavations of the Bell Field site were carried- out in the late 1960s and the early 1970s by Arthur Randolph Kelly. At this time, Kelly was affiliated with the University of Georgia and all excavations of Bell Field were done in partnership with the University as well as the National Park Service and Army Corps of Engineers. Field seasons were primarily in the summer months, where both local volunteers and University students assisted with the work. Archaeological investigations of the Bell Field site at this time were performed as salvage excavations to uncover any important artifacts or features that may have been lost to the construction of Carters Dam. Work done at the Bell Field site focused mainly on the central mound structures, with little attention paid to the surrounding village area. Site components and features Bell Field consisted of a central mound structure, flanked on its sides by terraces situated on the Coosawatee‚Äôs natural levees. The mound deposit itself showed stratification of artifacts and horizons associated with cycles of construction as well as the presence of four buildings atop the mound during its uppermost level of occupation. The general stratigraphy of the central mound showed a transition from a pure Dallas occupation to a mixed Dallas-Lamar one in its most terminal layers, which was expressed through eight levels of construction and occupation. It also contained several units of conjoined, auxiliary buildings connected by passageways immediately around the central mound complex. Among these buildings examined near the core mound was a ‚Äúcouncil-house‚Äù structure (just north of the mound) with a central hearth, circularly-oriented and tiered seats, and associated auxiliary quarters. The portion of the site corresponding to the village is thought to have existed and extended on both sides of the Coosawatee levee and the limited archaeological data for this portion of the site suggests at least three levels of occupation (based on brief surveys of house platforms southwest of the core mound). Another feature of importance at the Bell Field site includes a large platform structure in its southeastern extent which showed some evidence of building structures atop it, due to the presence of numerous post-molds. Material culture of the platform itself was exclusively Lamar. Storage pits full of burned corn and beans were also uncovered at the site. These appeared to be ritual in nature, based on the interment of the already-burned materials into the pits themselves as opposed to a burning of the site related to abandonment or removal. A public dance-floor is thought to have been located at the southern edge of the site as well. This is based on the excavation of a large, compacted feature of pure sand that was uniform in both thickness and composition. A series of three earth lodges, consisting of a central building flanked by others, was also uncovered by the later excavations of the 1970s. These lodges were situated underneath the core mound and pre-date the rest of the site significantly. There was also evidence that these lodge structures were rebuilt over-time and reused before the construction of the core mound. Dating and cultural implications Based on the data generated by the Kelley excavations, the chronology of the Bell Field site extends from a period of approximately 1000 AD to 1700 AD. The complete absence of historical artifacts or trade goods limits the site‚Äôs history to the early 1700s at the latest. Its earliest occupations are associated with the pre-Dallas earth lodges and are thought to correspond to a Savannah Period tradition based on the site‚Äôs geography and their construction. The main phases of occupation understood at the site are those associated with the core mound and village, which show a continued occupation from Dallas to Lamar, with the Lamar artifacts increasing in abundance in later portions of the site. These periods place the chronology of this portion of the Bell Field site firmly between the time of Hernando DeSoto‚Äôs explorations of the Southeast in the 1500s to the turn of the eighteenth century. The occurrence of Dallas culture artifacts is thought to be linked with the Coosa Upper Creek, based on the location of the site, similar occurrences in other areas, and ethnographic evidence. Similarly, the Lamar tradition artifacts are thought to be related to the Cherokee people of the region at this time, based mainly on ethnographic evidence and geography of the site. The supposed dance-floor at the southern edge of the site also lends itself to a Cherokee period of occupation, based on the occurrence of stomp-dances in Cherokee culture which could have produced the flat, compact deposit noted by Kelley. Another cultural activity present at Bell Field seems to have been ritual burning associated with cyclical cycles of rebuilding. This is most evident in the core mound stratigraphy as well as the proximate building complexes.

It was built in 1917 by film star Charlie Chaplin. After being sold by Chaplin in 1953, the property went through several changes in ownership and has served at various times as Kling Studios, the Red Skelton Studios, the shooting location for the Adventures of Superman and Perry Mason television series, and as the headquarters for A&M; Records and The Jim Henson Company. In 1969, it was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.  History   Construction  In October 1917, Charlie Chaplin announced plans to build his own film studio at the southeast corner of La Brea and Sunset Boulevard. In his autobiography, Chaplin described the decision as follows: > At the end of the Mutual contract, I was anxious to get started with First > National, but we had no studio. I decided to buy land in Hollywood and build > one. The site was the corner of Sunset and La Brea and had a very fine ten- > room house and five acres of lemon, orange and peach trees. We built a > perfect unit, complete with developing plant, cutting room, and offices.\\"At > the end of the Mutual\\": Chaplin, Charles, My Autobiography Chaplin purchased the site from R.S. McClellan, who lived on the site and had a large grove of orange trees on the property. The lot had of frontage on Sunset and on La Brea, extending south to De Longpre. Chaplin announced he would make his home on the northern part of the property, and build his own motion picture plant on the south part of the property, cornering at La Brea and De Longpre. Chaplin's plans for six English-style buildings, \\"arranged as to give the effect of a picturesque English village street,\\" were published in the Los Angeles Times in October 1917. The plans were prepared by the Milwaukee Building Company (Meyer & Holler), and the total investment was estimated to be in the region of $100,000. The layout of the buildings was described by the Los Angeles Times in 2002 as a \\"fairy-tale cottage complex.\\" Another writer has described the style as \\"eccentric Peter Pan architecture.\\" The location was at that time a residential neighborhood, and Chaplin's application for a building permit was opposed by area residents, some of whom complained that it was too near the Hollywood High School. However, the City Council voted 8‚Äì1 to approve Chaplin's permit. Chaplin reportedly built his \\"English cottage-style studio\\" in three months beginning in November 1917, at a reported cost of only $35,000. The DVD collection titled \\"Chaplin Collection\\" includes Chaplin's 1918 film How to Make Movies,https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=1918+How+to+Make+Movies which depicts the studio's construction in time-lapse photography. Construction of the studios was completed in approximately 1919. Chaplin preserved a large existing residence on the northern (Sunset Boulevard) end of the property, and planned to live there, but never in fact did. Various studio personnel lived there over the years, including his brother Sydney Chaplin. The \\"English cottages\\" along La Brea served as the facade for offices, a screening room, and a film laboratory. The grounds included stables, a swimming pool and tennis courts. The central part of the property, which was originally an orchard, became the backlot, where large outdoor sets were constructed. The two large open-air stages used for filming were constructed on the southern end of the property, and the rest of the facility consisted of dressing rooms, a garage, a carpenter's shed, and a film vault.  Charlie Chaplin (1919‚Äì1952)  Postcard of Charlie Chaplin Studios, 1922 Many of Chaplin's classic films were shot at the studios, including The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), The Great Dictator (1940), Monsieur Verdoux (1947), and Limelight (1952). Chaplin also filmed many famous visitors at his studios on La Brea, including Winston Churchill, Helen Keller, Lord Mountbatten, and Harry Lauder. The studios saw a number of changes over the next 20 years. The two open-air stages were converted to closed soundstages in the mid-1930s, before the filming of Modern Times, and a smaller stage was also built over the site of the studio swimming pool at that time. Stage 2 had previously been seriously damaged by a fire during production of The Circus in 1927. Also, the expansion of La Brea Avenue in 1928‚Äì29 forced the physical movement of the buildings adjacent to the street back from their original locations. In 1942, Chaplin sold the northern portion of the property, the portion containing the residence, tennis courts, and a portion of his backlot, to Safeway Stores. The house was demolished, and a shopping center was built in its place. In October 1943, Chaplin's studios were opened up for the first time to be used to shoot an outside production, Curly, produced by Columbia Pictures. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time that the Chaplin Studio \\"has been more or less sacrosanct, in the sense that outsiders were practically never permitted to work there.\\" However, studio manager Alfred Reeves told the Times that the Chaplin organization was \\"not going into the space rental business,\\" and that the use of the studios by Columbia would not create a precedent. In 1949, the studios were reportedly the site of Greta Garbo's last screen test.  Television production (1953‚Äì1966)  Chaplin left the US in October 1952 amid political persecution, and he sold the studio the following year to Webb and Knapp for $650,000. The new owner had planned to tear down the studio, but it was quickly leased to a television production company and became known as Kling Studios. In 1955, it was used to shoot the Adventures of Superman television series starring George Reeves. Beginning in 1959, Red Skelton shot his television series at the facility, and in April 1960 Skelton purchased the studio. From behind a desk in the office once occupied by Chaplin, Skelton said: > I'm not the head of the studio. I'll be president and just own the joint. > ... Seriously, I couldn't be a studio executive because I'm not qualified. > ... I've got a nice enough racket trying to make people laugh and don't > intend to foul that up. And, besides, that's harder than running a studio. Skelton also purchased three large mobile units for taping color television shows, making a total investment estimated at $3.5 million. Skelton had a large \\"Skelton Studios\\" sign erected over the main gate on La Brea Avenue. Skelton also removed a block of sidewalk on the studio grounds which Chaplin had signed and pressed his footprints into in 1918 for display at his Palm Springs home. Skelton sold the studio to CBS in 1962, and CBS shot the Perry Mason television series there from 1962‚Äì1966.  A&M; Records (1967‚Äì1999)  A&M; Studios Main Gate, February 1988 In 1966, Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss purchased the studio from CBS to serve as a headquarters for A&M; Records. A&M; Records had grown from $500,000 in revenues in 1964 to $30 million in 1967. Alpert and Moss reportedly \\"astonished the big network by having their bank deliver a cashier's check for more than $1 million, the full amount.\\" A&M; converted two of the old soundstages and Chaplin's swimming pool into a recording studio. A 1968 profile on Alpert and Moss described their renovation of Chaplin's old studios: > The old sound stages are in the process of being completely rebuilt into > what must be the most luxurious and pleasant recording studios in the world. > Chaplin's cement footprints are one of the few reminders of the past. The elderly Chaplin briefly revisited his former studio in 1972, when he made his only return trip to America to accept an honorary Academy Award. A&M; had hoped to welcome him back with a ceremony, but instead he chose to avoid the attention and arranged to drive by the studio gates on a weekend.  Historic designation  In February 1969, the old Chaplin Studios were designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. At the time, Carl Dentzel, the President of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board, said the property was one of the few locations from old Hollywood that retained a complete early-day production layout. Dentzel also noted, \\"His studio was one of the first to be established here and by some quirk of fate continuity from the movies' earliest times to today's television and recordings demands has persevered.\\" The studio was only the second entertainment-related building to receive the Historic-Cultural Monument designation. after Grauman's Chinese Theatre. In April 1989, the organization \\"Hollywood Heritage\\" celebrated the 100th anniversary of Chaplin's birth with a rare screening of Chaplin's 1918 documentary How to Make Movies and The Kid, both shown at the Chaplin Stage at A&M; Records. Chaplin's son, Sydney, received a plaque at the screening honoring his father's achievements.  The Jim Henson Company (2000‚Äìpresent)  Henson Studios Main Gate In February 2000, Jim Henson's children purchased the studio for $12.5 million to serve as the new home of The Jim Henson Company. Henson's daughter, Lisa Henson, said, \\"The buildings are a lovable hodge-podge of quirky, unusual spaces. There are unexpected elements in some of the offices like original vaults and fish tank-like bathrooms. It's not your typical corporate space, but it's ideal for the Muppets.\\" At a ceremony in June 2000, the Henson Company unveiled a color statue of Kermit the Frog, dressed as Chaplin's character The Tramp, above the studio's main gate. Henson's son, Brian Henson, said at the time, \\"When we heard that the Chaplin lot was for sale, we had to have it. It's the perfect home for the Muppets and our particular brand of classy, but eccentric entertainment. When people walk onto our lot, they fall in love with Hollywood again.\\" In 2007, the Sci-Fi Channel series Ghost Hunters shot an episode at the studios, reporting on ghost stories told for years by employees working on the lot. The lot was used as the set for the abandoned Muppet Studios in the 2011 film The Muppets.  Facilities   Henson Recording Studios  Henson Recording Studios (formerly A&M; Studios) is a recording studio located on the lot. It consists of four studio suites and a mixing suite. In 1985, the hit single and video \\"We Are the World\\" was recorded in Studio A by a cast that included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. On February 1, 2010, it was re-recorded there to benefit victims of the Haiti earthquake. Many notable recording artists have recorded songs, albums and videos at the studios, including Styx, The Carpenters, The Police, The Moody Blues, Oingo Boingo, David Lee Roth, Soundgarden, Take That, Van Morrison, Lindsay Lohan and Westlife. In 2011, Van Halen's comeback album, A Different Kind of Truth, was recorded in Studio C with producer John Shanks. On February 1, 2012, they performed live at Henson Studios to a celebrity-packed crowd, adding to the performance legend of the studio. Henson Recording Studios was also one of the places where punk rock band The Offspring recorded their ninth studio album Days Go By (2012) with producer Bob Rock.Booklet for Days Go By. Seether also recorded their 2014 album Isolate and Medicate at Henson Recording Studios. Alice in Chains recorded two albums at the studios: 2013's The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, and 2018's Rainier Fog.  Henson Soundstage  The Henson Soundstage (formerly Chaplin Stage) is a sound stage on the lot. During A&M;'s tenure, it was used to film music videos, including \\"Every Breath You Take\\" by The Police and \\"Ghostbusters\\" by Ray Parker Jr. In addition, Soul Train was taped there from 1981 to 1985.

The massacres resulted in the killing of more than 10,000 Assyrians and the captivity of thousands of others.  Background  Ottoman affairs By the 19th century, the weakened Ottoman Empire had started losing control over Upper Mesopotamia and Kurdistan. The Empire seemed on the brink of collapse when Muhammad Ali revolted in Egypt and took control of Syria. It was then that Kurdish Emirs found an opportunity to assert their independence. Among them was Ibrahim Pasha, a Kurdish Emir whose dominion included a region extending from Diyarbakir to Aleppo, and who fought alongside Muhammad Ali against the Ottomans and their allies from the Arab Shammar tribe in Jazira. Despite the failure of Muhammad Pasha in his Syrian campaign, the events showed the vulnerability of the Ottomans and encouraged Kurdish aghas to try and increase their control in the region. British fears of another French attempt similar to Napoleon's Egyptian campaign contributed to an increase of British influence. As these events unfolded, the British appointed Hormuzd Rassam, an ethnic Assyrian archaeologist from Mosul, and brother-in-law of Britain's ambassador in the city, as a delegate to expand British influence to the areas of the independent Assyrian tribes. British and American Protestant missionaries, such as Justin Perkins and Asahel Grant, started visiting the area in the same period. They generally showed great sympathy to the Assyrian Christians. The Kurds however were wary of them, and Assyrians hospitality towards the foreigners only increased their suspicion. The \\"hostile intention of the Kurds towards the Assyrians \\"was well known to British officials\\". On 27 January 1842, Canning wrote to the foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen, informing him that the Nestorians of Kurdistan have been subdued by a \\"Kurdish Bey\\" acting in concert with the Ottomans. Kurdish internal conflicts  War broke out in Hakkari in 1839 between Nurallah, brother of the former Emir, who governed from Bash Qal'a, and Suleyman his nephew whose capital was in Gullamerk. The Assyrians were also split in their allegiances, according to their distribution. Most of them, including the Patriarch of the Church of the East Shimun XVII Abraham, supported Suleyman as the rightful successor to his father. The conflict turned into a massacre when Nurallah defeated his opponent and retaliated by attacking Assyrian villages and the Patriarchate of Qodshanis in 1841. This led to a permanent rift in relations between the Kurds and Christians in general. However, not all Assyrian allied themselves with the Patriarch, some took advantage of his weakness to join Nurallah. The region descended into another war after a disagreement between Ottoman Vali of Mosul, Mohammed Pasha, and the Kurdish Agha Ismael Pasha of Amadiya. The latter resorted to Nurallah of Hakkari and Badr Khan, the ambitious emir of Buhtan. The three formed an alliance and called Assyrians to join them. The Patriarch however refused to do so after receiving promises from Mosul to protect them in case of the Kurds decided to retaliate again. War between the Kurds and Ottomans broke out in summer 1842. The next months were particularly calm in Hakkari with the Kurds busy with the war in Mosul, and missionary Asahel Grant commenced building a large religious school in the Christian town of Ashitha and provided it with Syriac books and scriptures from Mosul in September 1842. The Kurdish campaign ended the same month with failure, and Assyrians were blamed for refusing to intervene in the war. Rumours spread that Grant built a castle to be used against the Kurds, and Nurallah protested to the vali of Erzurum. In addition, Ibrahim Pasha of Mosul was also alarmed by the rumours and the increased missionary activities in the region. He described in a letter to the Porte how Grant and the Christians built a huge building containing 200 rooms at least. 1843 massacre In early 1843 Nurallah sent for a meeting with the Patriarch and the latter apologized using the weather, his religious duties, and the presence of a guest, the British missionary George Badger, as a pretence. It seemed that the Patriarch made his decision after being convinced by Badger to distrust the Kurds and to request assistance from the English or the Porte if the Kurds were to attack. Once Badger left, Nurallah renewed his alliance with the Badr Khan and Ismail Pasha, and requested permission from the Ottoman Vali of Mosul to subjugate the Christians. In July 1843 the Kurdish alliance, led by Badr Khan attacked the Assyrians in Hakkari, destroyed their villages and killed many of them. Hormuzd Rassam tried using his influence with the Vali of Baghdad Najib Pasha to pressure Badr Khan for the release of prisoners which included close relatives of the Patriarch of the Church of the East who had in the meantime taken refuge in Mosul.It was reported that the \\"Kurdish leader Bedr Khan had invaded the country of the Christian tribes, bent on destroying them through a campaign of terror, in which large numbers had been killed and others taken captive to be sold as slaves.\\" Aboona, 2008, p. 199-212 His attempts only led to the release of about 150, one of whom was the sister of the Patriarch, while the rest were distributed as war booty between Kurdish and Turkish Agha's and Mullahs. On 3 August, the Kurdish forces had succeeded in \\"subduing the tribes and it was reported that 'still the slaughter is not yet ended, and several who have attempted to flee have been murdered...'\\". Then the invaders had turned \\"against the district of Tiyari, where they had succeeded in occupying the villages and indulged in the cruelest acts against its people\\". Even \\"those who had not opposed the Kurdish invasion had been treated in the same way as the fighters.\\" The patriarch's mother's body was chopped into four pieces. Many women and young children \\"were taken captive to be sold as slaves.\\" On 21 August 1843, the British consul Abbott reported on \\"the role of the Persian Kurds\\" in the massacres of Assyrian and Nestorian tribes. The \\"prime agitator for the attack from the Persian frontier was the 'Shaik'\\" of the Kurds of Bradost\\". The Kurdish tribes were \\"marching in large numbers directly to the Assyrian provinces.\\" It was reported that the \\"killing and destruction continued apace. Corpses lay everywhere. The surviving men and women were forced to carry unbearable loads of booty for very long distances, while being lashed all along the way until they fell from torture and exhaustion\\". Ross wrote, '[T]hey were tortured in an awful manner to force them to expose what they call hidden treasures, while others were killing them just for entertainment and as sport and games'. The tribes \\"were all but encircled and left with no safe route to escape\\" the slaughter. Those that tried to flee had to take a route that passed through the hostile Kurds of Berwar. One group after another was caught and slaughtered \\"while trying to escape\\". It is estimated by contemporary sources that the victims of the assault of 1843 numbered ten thousand, but according to Adoona, that figure \\"cannot represent the total victims of the attack\\". 1846 massacre Another massacre was inflicted by Badr Khan in 1846. This massacre received international attention through western press; it also woke European politicians and public opinion to the plight of Ottoman Christians. This led the European countries to pressure the Porte to intervene and stop the massacres. Aftermath More than 10,000 Assyrians perished during the massacres. The Kurdish massacres were a precursor to the later Ottoman incursions which ended both the semi-independent status which the Assyrian tribes enjoyed in the mountainous areas, and that which the Kurds had as well. The Ottomans saw the communal conflict as an opportunity to overthrow the last semi-independent Kurdish Emirates in 1847, establishing direct control of the entire region. An Ottoman army was sent to the region in 1847, and clashed with the Kurds in several battles that ended with the arrest of both Badr Khan and Nurallah, and their exile in 1850. Following the Ottoman Hakkari province was established and governed from Ba≈ükale. Due to the massacres of 1843-1846 committed by the troops of the Kurdish leader Bedr Khan Beg against the independent Assyrian tribes, \\"the long-Iasting existence of the Assyrian people as an independent body\\" was ended.

The 2007 Morocco‚ÄìSpain diplomatic conflict was a short-lived disturbance of international relations between Morocco and Spain that arose after the announcement of the impending visit of the King of Spain to the Spanish-ruled autonomous cities Ceuta and Melilla, which are claimed by Morocco. The dispute formally began when the Government of Morocco recalled its ambassador to Spain, Omar Azziman. According to a diplomatic note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, \\"The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty King Juan Carlos I, on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives.\\" After reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,\\"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation.\\" The royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the King in both Ceuta and Melilla. During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, Abbas El Fassi, compared the situation in both cities with the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories and King Mohammed VI himself described the visit as an \\"outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era.\\" The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality.\\" Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in Tetuan, as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla. Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country. Finally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Miguel Angel Moratinos, visited Rabat to meet his Moroccan counterpart, Taib Fassi Fihri on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries. Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict. Royal visit Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia. On October 30, the Government of Spain announced the visit of King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, had told that fact to the opposition leader Mariano Rajoy during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed. The King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as Prince of Asturias on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Spanish Legion. The last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king Alfonso XIII, who was last seen in 1927, and President of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala Zamora, on 4 November 1933. The king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit. On November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the Assembly of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he \\"had an pending commitment to Ceuta\\". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, Elena Salgado, or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco. The King was welcomed by 25,000 people. On November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the Assembly. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that \\"Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors.\\" The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000. Additional background of the conflict A month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the National Court of Spain, Baltasar Garz√≥n, had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of Sahrawis by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the Polisario Front. Moroccan spokesman said that \\"it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf.\\" Among the accused were Driss Basri and former Interior Minister and General Housni Benslimane. As stated by Yassine Mansouri, Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in Mallorca, the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco; and to bet on movements like the Tablig (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the Muslim Brotherhood. Mansouri informed this to Alberto Saiz, Director of National Intelligence of Spain. The position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the Commander of the Faithful and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, Laarbi Maateis, is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism. He also said the prosecution were not understandable \\"because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city.\\" Position of the Moroccan government Mohamed VI. The Prime Minister of Morocco, Abbas El Fassi, reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to \\"waive\\" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, Khalid Naciri, expressed the \\"total rejection and condemnation\\" of the royal visit to \\"despoiled Moroccan cities.\\" Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict \\"must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation.\\" On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue. The same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, Mustafa Ramid, by manifesting in the Parliament that \\"the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization.\\" Manifestations of King Mohamed VI On November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the Green March in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman: In the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities: Reactions of the Moroccan government after the visit of the King On 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish \\"place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis.\\" Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that \\"our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations.\\" However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the Minister of Public Works, Magdalena √Ålvarez, who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport Karim Ghellab about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the strait (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the Army of Spain, Admiral Sebastian Zaragoza. Position of the Spanish Government On the same day, November 1, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who was visiting the Moroccan city of Marrakech, reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi- Fihri, despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said that relations with the Moroccan government \\"were extraordinary\\" and the journey of the Kings fell within the \\"institutional normality.\\" Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in Rabat, Spanish diplomatic sources said. On November 3, Defense Minister Jos√© Antonio Alonso, in a statement to the Cadena SER said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit. The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed on November 14 its confidence in the return of the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid \\"as soon as possible.\\" Political reactions Political reactions in Spain The People's Party and United Left political parties, through Angel Acebes and Gaspar Llamazares, respectively, announced their support for the visit of the King of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla. Gustavo de Ar√≠stegui, of the People Party, termed Mohamed VI's reaction as \\"excessive\\" and criticized the Spanish Prime Minister for failing to make clear, in his view, the 'red lines' that Morocco could not cross. Meanwhile, Elena Valenciano, International Relations Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, stressed that the visit was part of \\"the most absolute institutional normality.\\" The President of Melilla, Juan Jos√© Imbroda, said that \\"it is not the time to make opposite sounding declarations\\", in reference to the Moroccan position. Coalition for Melilla, the prime Muslim-based opposition party in the autonomous city, manifested itself as extremely pleased with the visit the King, adding that the presence of the King of Spain was a \\"historic debt in this city and which, from this formation, we always advocate for the occurrence of the visit.\\" For his part, the President of Ceuta, Juan Jesus Vivas, merely issued an edict in which he urged the citizens to welcome the King, honor him by the presence of Ceutans, and \\"you will honor yourselves, our city and our beloved country.\\" References Category:2007 in international relations Category:2007 in Morocco Category:2007 in Spain Category:Diplomatic incidents Category:Morocco‚ÄìSpain relations Category:Political controversies Category:Politics of Morocco Category:Politics of Ceuta Category:Politics of Melilla Category:History of Melilla ","title":"2007 Morocco‚ÄìSpain diplomatic conflict"},{"id":"33934775","text":"Assara funerella is a species of snout moth in the genus Assara.

It was then restored and extended in 1929-30 for use as the school chapel in commemoration of those old boys and staff who had died in the First World War. The medieval remains were the eastern part of the south aisle and adjacent fragments of the nave of the church. History as a church The parish church dedicated to St Paul lay just within the town walls in the north-eastern corner of the Medieval town and contains some of the earliest fabric of all Stamford churches having been built no later than 1152. It was in the patronage of the Priory of Saint-Fromond in Normandy in the mid eleventh century but had come into the hands of lay patrons by 1413.John S Hartley and Alan Rogers, The Religious Foundations of Medieval Stamford. Stamford Survey Group Report 2. University of Nottingham, 1974. Of what remains, the two east bays of the south wall are first half of the twelfth century and although the proportions suggest the church was large, with a nave of four or five bays,B.L. Deed, The History of Stamford School, Cambridge University Press, 1954; 1982. the plan of the church at that time is unknown; it may have been rectangular without a chancel.Royal Commission on Historical Monuments. The Town of Stamford. London, 1977. \\"Externally the arched corbel table, the flat east buttress, and the frieze at sill level of the windows show this south wall at once to be Norman.\\" The walls are of Barnack stone, coursed rubble with ashlar dressings and incorporate miniature arches and rounded corbels, supporting a later battlemented parapet. Reset between the bays is a (sealed) fifteenth-century doorway. The two east-most windows in the south wall are early fourteenth century and those in the east wall, which is c. 1200, are late fifteenth century. The north aisle, comprising two medieval (the east-most) and two modern arches, has stiff-leaf decoration on the capitals of the former. St Paul's had a tower and belfry and there was a room over the church door. Inside, there is a fourteenth-century doorway to a former rood loft stair. In the south east corner where the altar stood (and stands) are three piscina recesses presumably credences with carved chamfered ogee heads of the fourteenth century. The remains (the lower halves) of two ‚Äúgood fourteenth century figures‚ÄùPevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England, Lincolnshire. Penguin, 1964 thought to be of St John and the Virgin Mary found during excavations in the early twentieth century were placed high up on the south wall. There are two tomb recesses in the south wall, one finely-moulded, probably of c.1300. In one is a large, stone coffin lid with carved inscription in medieval French which commemorates Henry de Elyngton, Rector of St Paul's between 1384 and 1400, (although this stone has suffered from some physical deterioration in recent years), and in the other a miniature, thirteenth-century coffin lid, presumably that of a child. Over the interior of the west door is an arched inscription commemorating Eustace Malherbe (Eustachius Malerbe), Member of Parliament for Stamford in 1322, and also a male, bearded, stone head, believed to be of Christ. Attached to the church was originally the cell of an anchorite, mentioned in 1382, 1435 and 1521, wherein a female hermit was walled up effectively for the duration of her life. The main part of the present building was originally a chapel dedicated to St Katherine and the religious guild of St Katherine (refounded in 1480 by Alderman William Browne, founder of Browne's Hospital) met for its services in the chapel. The guild was a wealthy one and its members included Lady Margaret Beaufort, Princess Cecily of York and David Cecil, grandfather of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley and Alderman William Radcliffe, founder of Stamford School. After the Reformation, parts of its property came into the hands of the Cecil family in 1549. St Paul's was one of the more modest livings in Stamford which may have contributed to the decision to close it. It may also have suffered at the hands of Lancastrian army which sacked Stamford in 1461. Following an Act of Parliament of 1548 permitting amalgamation of Stamford's parishes, St Paul's was amalgamated with St George's and the church, now redundant, was largely demolished, its fixtures and fittings sold. Post-Reformation use Amid the upheavals of the Reformation, Stamford School, founded in 1532, left its original home in the Corpus Christi chapel of Stamford's church of St Mary and moved into the remaining section of St Paul's church on the north side of St Paul's Street. The move occurred perhaps as early as 1548 when the school's future was secured by Act of Parliament arranged by senior court official and old boy, William Cecil, and had certainly been completed by 1556. From the mid-sixteenth century the surviving part of St Paul's ‚Äì essentially the south aisle of the Medieval church and part of the nave consisting of two bays - served as a school room until 1929. A second school room was added on the north side of the building in 1833. A marble memorial tablet was erected around 1902 on the north wall to two former pupils who fell in the Second Boer War. Modern restoration View of chapel from southwest Over 1929-30 the building was extended westwards to its original length of four bays and restored to ecclesiastical use as the chapel of Stamford School in memorial to those of the School community who had died in the First World War. The work was overseen by architects Traylen and Lenton of Stamford. The foundation stone, an ancient carved stone head known as \\"the Old Man\\" (the subject of generations of schoolboy tradition) which formed the keystone above the west door of the school room, was laid on 17 October 1929 by Lady Burghley. The work was completed in 1930 and now comprises a rectangular building with a combined nave and sanctuary and north aisle. (What is now the nave of the chapel originally constituted the south aisle of St Paul's church, while the north aisle of today's chapel was originally part of the medieval nave). Extensive oak panelling by Bowmans of Stamford covers the interior walls and the altar table, cross, candlesticks and riddel posts (also by Bowmans) present as Low Church Anglican. The chapel was re-consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln, William Swayne on 21 June 1930. The names of staff and old boys who fell in the First World War are carved either side of the altar, and after the Second World War the names of those who died, together with details of rank, regiment and circumstances of death, were added to oak panels around the walls. The benches are carved with names of those who made substantial contributions to the original rebuilding fund or, subsequently, to the life of the chapel over the twentieth century. Since 22 May 1954 the Chapel has been a Grade II listed building. In 1961, a nineteenth century Gray and Davison pipe organ was installed although this was removed in the 1990s and replaced with an electronic substitute.

He was the second son of Landgrave Ernest of Hesse-Rheinfels and Maria Eleonore of Solms- Lich.  Life  After an inheritance dispute about the \\"Rotenburg Quarter\\", Charles received Hesse-Eschwege in 1667. He moved to Wanfried and founded the Catholic line of Hesse-Wanfried. He used the castle in Wanfried as his residence, because the castle in Eschwege had been pledged to Brunswick- Bevern, also in 1667.  Marriages  Charles's first wife was Sophie Magdalene, a daughter of Count Eric Adolph of Salm-Reifferscheid and his wife Magdalene. Sophie Magdalene died in 1675 during a trip to Venice. Charles then married Alexandrine Juliane, a daughter of Count Emich XIII of Leiningen and the widow of Landgrave George III of Hesse-Itter-V√∂hl. She died on 19 April 1703 and was buried in the family vault in the H√ºlfensberg in Wanfried.  Death and heir  Charles died in 1711 and was succeeded as Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried by his son William II.

Business loans, leases, and other investments are offered depending on the stage of development, needs and capacity of each business. Rise provides business financing up to $25,000 throughout Ontario, with financing averaging from $3000 to $5000. The Rotman School of Management and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health participate in advisory functions, lending their respective expertise for business mentoring and mental health supports and services to the benefit of Rise clients. In January 2012, Rise received the Social Entrepreneurship in Mental Health Equity Award for Toronto social enterprises advancing mental health equity. History Sandra Rotman founded Rise Asset Development. She brought to the table the Rotman School and Management (University of Toronto) and Ontario's world-leading Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) for their respective expertise. Through initial funding from Sandra Rotman, Rise conducted a pilot to assist entrepreneurs living with mental health and addiction challenges to explore self-employment and build successful, self-sustaining small businesses. In 2009, the initial pilot successfully helped a small group of emerging entrepreneurs to access investment capital, business mentoring and support. The pilot confirmed that the financial assistance and supports offered by Rise could help grow small business while improving the outlook of a marginalized segment of the community. The program has allowed certain clients to graduate from Ontario Disability Support Program and become more self-sufficient. In 2012, the Ontario Ministry of Youth Services announced that they formed a new partnership with Rise to create a program that targets youth living with mental health and addiction challenges. The goal of this initiative is to work with fifty young entrepreneurs between the ages of 16 and 29 over three years. Rise will deliver the program and provide microfinancing while Ontario will finance the business training for entrepreneurs. Over the same year, Rise expanded services to Ottawa and other Ontario communities. Rise is working alongside Causeway Work Centre to delivery microfinancing in the Ottawa region with the support from Alterna Savings. The rapid success of Rise has attracted other funders including Citi Canada (the Canadian branch of New-York based Citibank) and the Royal Bank of Canada. In addition, Rise has launched a pilot group-lending program with the help of Citi Foundation. Mental Health and Addiction & Self-Employment Health Canada estimates that 1 in 5 Ontarians will experience a serious mental health or a substance abuse issue in their lifetime. In 2007‚Äì08, Ontario spent more than $2.5 billion on mental health and addiction services. Employment has been identified as a leading component in promoting positive mental health and supporting a fulfilling life in the community. Individuals who return to work demonstrate significant improvements in self-esteem and symptom management when compared with those who do not work. For most people, meaningful employment is a key element in their economic, social and personal lives. However, individuals living with mental illness and addictions face many barriers in finding and maintaining employment. Stigma is often the most prohibitive. In 2001, a group of 149 unemployed clients with severe mental illness received vocational rehabilitation and were assessed on the effects of work on psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and self-esteem at 6-month intervals throughout the 18-month study. Participants were classified into 4 groups: competitive work, sheltered work, minimal work, and no work. The competitive group showed significantly higher rates of improvement than the other groups. The larger body of research on employment for people with mental illness leads us to a multitude of studies confirming this finding. Self-employment can be an appropriate employment strategy to overcome the high unemployment rate among this population. Entrepreneurship can also facilitate the generation of supplementary income to assist people living with mental illness and addictions improve their quality of life and economic well-being. 54% of persons in self-employment had held their job for over 12 months compared to 35% of people in employment through an employer and people in self-employment more closely mirrored the general population in terms of the job sectors in which they work. Program Rise provides loans, leases, and lines of credits and other financial products. The term of the loan is up to 3 years. The average loan size is $3000 to $5000. Rise also provides their clients with a business mentorship and support. The program is targeted towards people with mental health and addiction challenges who cannot get loans through traditional means due to bad credit history or lack of funds. In June 2012, Rise launched its Youth Small Business Program which targets young adults between the ages of 16 and 29. This business training program is offered to individuals living with a mental health or addiction challenge and provides a $500 start up grant for their businesses. Upon completion of the program, entrepreneurs may be eligible for traditional Rise financing. Rise strives to add dimensions to the often 'single story' of people with mental health and addiction challenges. With that in perspective, Rise Asset Developments will commit over $200,000 in financing to entrepreneurs living with mental illness and addictions throughout Ontario (Canada) in 2013. Rise will scale its model to three new cities within Ontario, grow its mentorship program across the province, build a targeted youth program and pilot a group lending product targeting transitional homes, community housing and existing peer mental health or addiction support groups. Mission Recognizing the interdependency of financial well being to one's overall quality of life, Rise works to empower business owners with access to financing and business support. Rise is committed to improving the lives of people who are unable to secure employment due to mental health or addiction challenges. Future Having proved that people with mental health challenges can run viable businesses, Rise is expanding its program across the province. Rise has launched its operations in Ottawa through the Causeway Work Centre.

The play was first published in 1689. The work is considered a loa, a short theatrical piece related to the longer auto sacramental. This loa is a commentary on historical events involving indigenous Aztec inhabitants and Spanish colonists. The Divine Narcissus is ambiguous not only because the Spanish do not openly explain their objectives to the native population, but also because the story presupposes the success of evangelization in Mexico. Plot summary Scene I: The first scene begins with the celebration by the local inhabitants of the God of Seeds. Two thousand believers offer sacrifices. They sacrifice believing that this will cause the harvest to be bountiful. The characters Occident and America (both locals) have a conversation regarding their common religious views. Scene II: The character Religion (a Spanish woman) attacks the local inhabitants' idol worship as a disgrace. She complains to Zeal (The Spanish Captain in Armor) to display more righteous anger. She demands that Occident and America abandon their idol worship and follow the true doctrine. Occident and America are startled by the challenge, but disregard her message and view her as crazy and confused. The character Zeal (a Spanish captain) stands up to Occident and America and tells them that God will not permit them to continue their crimes and that he has been sent by God to punish them. Scene III: Occident surrenders to Religion due to force. Zeal wants America to die, but Religion argues to keep her alive. America and Occident refuse to abandon their worship of the great God of Seeds. Zeal and Religion doubt the natives' explanation, believing in the need to follow one true God. Scene IV: Religion questions Occident and America, \\"What is this god that you adore?\\" and Occident explains the impact that their god has on their crops. Religion responds with complete disregard and America responds that there is only one God. Religion refuses to believe that they all worship the same God. Scene V: The final scene offers another play, Divine Narcissus to inform the audience that idolatry is the devil's workshop. Religion plans on performing it in the crown city of Madrid, the royal seat of her Catholic kings. Characters The loa presents the main characters in two pairs: Occident and America, and [Christian] Religion and Zeal. Characters are listed in order of appearance as follows: *Music - Featured in the first scene singing about noble Mexican origins at a celebration of the great God of Seeds. This character provides information about the native inhabitants and sets the tone of the play. Music urges everyone present in the first scene to participate in the celebration of the God of Seeds. *America - Appears in the form of a gorgeously attired Indian woman, who represents the indigenous population. She is seen dressed in elaborate cloaks and tunic. This character is shown in the first scene mid- conversation with Occident. America adores the God of Seeds and is opposed to converting to Christianity. *Occident - This character is present in the first scene and initiates conversations with America. Occident, as well as America, adores the God of Seeds and refuses to change his religious views. *Zeal - This character is first presented in the second scene in conversation with Religion. Zeal is disguised as Commander in Chief. Zeal later confronts Occident for following idolatry and scorning Religion. He instigates punishment of the native inhabitants. *Religion ‚Äì First appears in the second scene conversing with Zeal in the form of a Spanish lady. Later tries to aggressively convert Occident. Religion favors repression of the older ways of the indigenous population. *Soldiers ‚Äì These are seen later in the act and represent both native inhabitants and European invaders. Themes and symbolism Sor Juana‚Äôs work shows apparent parallelism between her life and the struggle of the individual, specifically being for women in respect to creative fulfillment and self-expression. Uniquely for her time, she emphasizes the idea of equality of women. She portrays feminine resistance to male domination. The majority of the loa centers on freedom of choice for the native inhabitants in opposition of the Spanish invaders. Symbols are apparent in the names of the characters, such as Music, which typically signifies prosperity, pleasure, and an expression of emotions in a positive manner. Religion represents Catholic practice in Spain. This character is portrayed as a woman scorned by America and Occident for being crazy and confused, and they disregard her words. America is portrayed as a proud female native inhabitant. America symbolizes riches or abundance, which is later exploited and taken away by the Spanish invaders.

Career The Tarbox Ramblers Michael Tarbox formed The Tarbox Ramblers in 1994. The band's sound originally centered on arrangements of early twentieth-century blues, gospel and Appalachian music (1,2). It later included Tarbox's original songs. The Tarbox Ramblers' albums on the Rounder label include a self-titled debut and a second release titled A Fix Back East. They feature Tarbox, string-bassist Johnny Sciascia and violinist Daniel Kellar, with drummers Jon Cohan, RL Hulsman, Howie Ferguson and Alan Sheinfeld. Most of A Fix Back East was produced in Memphis by Jim Dickinson; several tracks were produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie at Camp Street Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The music on the Tarbox Ramblers albums is characterized by three-part vocal harmonies, a heavy rhythm section and the interplay of slide guitar and violin. Solo work Tarbox has worked as a solo artist throughout his career, often favoring a drum-guitar duo format (3). In 2010 he released his first solo album, My Primitive Joy. Produced by Scott McEwen at The Fry Pharmacy Studio in Old Hickory, TN, its spare arrangements, acoustic sound and lyrical approach stand in contrast to The Tarbox Ramblers' aggressive amplified sound. A second solo album was slated for release in 2012. Television Michael Tarbox's songs have been used in the television shows Sons of Anarchy (4) and Supernatural (5).

In reflection seismology, a dim spot is a local low amplitude seismic attribute anomaly that can indicate the presence of hydrocarbonsSchlumberger: Oilfield Glossary and is therefore known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. It primarily results from the decrease in acoustic impedance contrast when a hydrocarbon (with a low acoustic impedance) replaces the brine-saturated zone (with a high acoustic impedance) that underlies a shale (with the lowest acoustic impedance of the three), decreasing the reflection coefficient. Occurrence For a dim spot to occur, the shale has to have a lower acoustic impedance than both the water sand and the oil/gas sand, which is the opposite situation required for a bright spot to occur. This is possible because compaction causes the acoustic impedances of sands and shales to increase with age and depth but it does not happen uniformly ‚Äì younger shales have a higher acoustic impedance than younger sands, but this reverses at depth, with older shales having a lower acoustic impedance than older sands.Brown, Alistar. R., (2010), ‚ÄúDim Spots in Seismic Images as Hydrocarbon Indicators‚Äù, AAPG Search and Discovery Article #40514.

He was the constable of Urquhart Castle (1296-1297) and after the English defeat at the Battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297, he was appointed constable of Stirling Castle, which he later surrendered and was imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle. Life FitzWarin was made constable of Urquhart Castle following the English invasion of Scotland in 1296. Alarmed at the rebellion led by Andrew Moray, the English appointed sheriff of Inverness, Reginald le Chen ordered his principal lieutenants, including FitzWarin to a meeting at Inverness Castle on 25 May 1297 to discuss how to deal with Andrew Moray.Calendar of Documents, ed. J.Bain, vol.2, no.922, p.239. After the meeting FitzWarin returned to Urquhart Castle accompanied by his escort of men-at-arms. A few miles south of Inverness, his party was ambushed by a force led by Andrew Moray and Alexander Pilche. With the loss of a number of men and horses, FitWarin was fortunate to escape with his life to the safety of Urquhart Castle. The next day the castle was besieged by Moray, who demanded its surrender. Euphemia, the Countess of Ross unexpectedly arrived on the scene with her retinue. The countess, whose husband was held by King Edward I of England in the Tower of London,Calendar of Documents, ed. J.Bain, vol.2, no.742, pp.176-8. advised Moray to surrender. Moray refused, however she did not move against Moray. Although her advice was ignored, her actions were later commended to the king by FitzWarin. Moray, with no heavy siege equipment available to him, tried to take the castle in a night attack and having failed, was forced to abandon the siege. He left FitzWarin in possession of the castle. Following the siege, FitzWarin wrote to King Edward in July 1297: \\"Some evil disposed people have joined Andrew Moray at the castle of Avoch in Ross.\\" Urquhart Castle was again besieged by Andrew Moray and with little supplies the castle garrison was eventually starved into submission. Present at the Battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297, he survived the defeat of the English army at the hands of the Scots under William Wallace. He was appointed, by John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey the leader of the English army, to the constabulary of Stirling Castle, with Marmaduke Thweng as his deputy, following the rout of the English army. FitzWarin, with Marmaduke Thweng surrendered Stirling Castle and were committed as prisoners to Dumbarton Castle. FitzWarin was later exchanged for Henry St Clair, Baron of Roslin in a prisoner exchange.Armstrong & McBride, p. 56. FitzWarin died some point around 1299.

One of her biggest hits is \\"Srce je moje violina\\" (My Heart is a Violin). Early life and family Lepava Mu≈°oviƒá in the village of Miloƒçaj near Kraljevo in Serbia, at the time part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Contrary to most sources, Lepava was actually born 13 January 1940, rather than 16 January 1940 when she was given a birth certificate. Her father, Radisav, died in 1942, at age 30, when Lepava was two years old. Her mother, Milosija (1913‚Äì2007), lived to the age of 94. Lepava has one older brother, Radomir, born in 1936. Career Lepava began singing at about the age of ten, circa 1950 in her village. Her professional singing career began in the 1960s, when she recorded duets with singers Miƒáa Stojanoviƒá and Gvozden Radiƒçeviƒá. At the beginning of her professional career, Lukiƒá wished to sing as a soloist instead of in the then- popular duet format. During a concert in Aleksandrovac, Lukiƒá expressed her desire to sing as a soloist to accordion player and composer Radojka ≈Ωivkoviƒá (1923‚Äì2002). At first hesitant, ≈Ωivkoviƒá agreed after Lepa began crying and begging her to allow her to prove herself as a solo singer. Upon hearing Lepa sing one song, ≈Ωivkoviƒá asked her to sing a second, a third, and a fourth. There are two versions of how Lepa Lukiƒá got her solo recording deal. Her version says that on a bus ride to Belgrade in 1967, the composer Petar Tanasijeviƒá was sitting behind her and tapped her shoulder and asked her if she wanted to record as a soloist, which she immediately agreed to. The next day, Tanasijeviƒá offered her the song \\"Od izvora dva putiƒáa\\" (From the Spring of Two Roads), which she recorded along with three other songs for her first album, released in 1967. The other version of the story, as told by Petar Tanasijeviƒá, was that one night in autumn of 1964, on a bus ride to Aleksandrovac, he was sitting in front of Lepa as she sang a song which annoyed him, so he asked her to stop. She looked at him in defiance and continued singing. After they arrived to Belgrade and got off the bus, he asked somebody who that \\"uncivilized\\" girl on the bus was. He was told that she was just a \\"kafana singer\\". During the concert that night, he was in the audience when Lepa came onto the stage with accordion player Radojka ≈Ωivkoviƒá to sing. He said that he shuddered and a chill went down his spine when he heard her voice on stage, even comparing her to popular sevdalinka singer Nada Mamula. After her performance, he found her backstage and congratulated her. He promised to write a song for her and she said \\"I love you. Help me get out of the kafanas. I'm sick of everything.\\" As his version of the story goes, one year later he composed the song \\"Od izvora dva putiƒáa\\" and thought of her. He contacted her and gave her the song. Although she never met novelist Ivo Andriƒá (1892‚Äì1975), it was rumored that he liked her song \\"Vremena su pro≈°la stara\\" (Old Times Have Passed), also written by Petar Tanasijeviƒá. Personal life Lukiƒá has been married three times. Her third husband is named Milan Milanoviƒá. She did not have children with any of her husbands. She was a friend of footballer Miljan Miljaniƒá (1930‚Äì2012), as well as Bosnian singer Silvana Armenuliƒá (1939‚Äì1976), with whom she was asked to perform with at Silvana's final concert the night she died in 1976, but overslept for the first time in her career and did not make it to the concert. Had she gone, she believes she would have lost her life in the car accident that killed Silvana and her sister Mirsada Mirjana Bajraktareviƒá. In 2013, Lepa revealed in an interview that she hasn't driven a car since Silvana's death, out of fear that she would share the same fate as the two sisters.

He was again wounded during the Battle of Naousa in April 1949. Gratzios was an artillery officer, but after the civil war, he was trained in special operations in Greece and Germany and held several command and staff positions in the Greek Special Forces: commander of the Paratroopers School, of the 5th Raider Squadron, of the Special Forces in Cyprus (in 1965-67).

After the Salina First Christian Church congregation relocated, Kassem, the founder and owner of Acoustic Sounds, Inc., bought the building to provide more storage space for the international LP record and CD mail-order business he started in 1986. Kassem decided to use the church sanctuary as a recording area due to its superior acoustics. His desire was to bring seasoned blues musicians from throughout the United States to record at Blue Heaven. His goal has been to document and showcase the authentic sounds of their music.Jeri Clouston, \\"Salina Sings The Blues\\", Kansas! magazine, Fall 2001 First concert In August 1997, Jimmy Rogers performed the first concert at Blue Heaven.

This is an objective of European Neighbourhood Policy, and forthcoming Eastern Partnership Program.EU Strategy for the South Caucasus Overlook EU Foreign Affairs Council held on 8 December 2009 the EU reaffirmed its intention to promote stability, co-operation, prosperity and good governance throughout the South Caucasus, including through technical assistance programs. Strategy Considering that South Caucasus region is threatened with Abkhaziya/Osetiya and Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts, EU policy towards the region focused primarily on solution of this problem. These conflicts create a serious obstacles toward peace, security and co-operation in the region.Laure Delcor ‚Äì Hubert Duhot, Bringing South Caucasus Closer to Europe ‚Äì Achievements and Challenges in ENP Implementation European Parliament resolution of 20 May 2010 on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus (2009/2216(INI)) focused on problems after Georgian-Russian war on occupation by Russian and Armenian forces subsequently Georgian and Azerbaijani lands. EU approach toward solution of Georgian conflict EU reiterates its unconditional support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognised borders of Georgia, and calls on Russia to respect them; encourages the Georgian authorities to make further efforts to achieve a settlement of Georgia's internal conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. EU is seriously concerned about the use of ethnic cleansing as a prelude to the Russian recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian statehood; notes with satisfaction that the international community remains united in its rejection of the unilateral declaration of independence; calls on Russia to honour its commitment in the Ceasefire Agreement to withdraw its troops to the positions held before the outbreak of the August 2008 war and to cease its blocking of EUMM access to South Ossetia and Abkhazia; EU stresses the importance of protecting the safety and rights of the ethnic Georgians still living within the breakaway regions, promoting respect for displaced persons' right of return under safe and dignified conditions, achieving a reduction in the Iron Curtain character of the de facto borders and obtaining possibilities for the EU and other international actors to assist people within the two regions; underlines the need for more clearly identified short- and medium-term objectives in this respect.Committee of Foreign Affairs, DRAFT REPORT on an EU Strategy for the South Caucasus (2009/2216(INI) EU approach toward solution of Nagorno- Karabakh conflict Currently EU has a very weak stand in issue of Nagorno Karabakh. Regarding that France as a co-head of Minsk Group are very ineffective, EU would like to take place of France in Minsk group which in charge for solution of the conflict.Roxana Cristescu and Amanda Paul. EU and Nagorno-Karabakh: a 'better than nothing' approach, 15.03.2011 In its Resolution on Strategy for the South Caucasus, EU calls on the parties to intensify their peace talk efforts for the purpose of a settlement in the coming months, to show a more constructive attitude and to abandon preferences to perpetuate the status quo created by force and with no international legitimacy, creating in this way instability and prolonging the suffering of the war-affected populations; condemns the idea of a military solution and the heavy consequences of military force already used, and calls on both parties to avoid any further breaches of the 1994 ceasefire. EU is seriously concerned that hundreds of thousands of refugees and IDPs who fled their homes during or in connection with the Nagorno-Karabakh war remain displaced and denied their rights, including the right to return, property rights and the right to personal security; calls on all parties to unambiguously and unconditionally recognise these rights, the need for their prompt realisation and for a prompt solution to this problem that respects the principles of international law; demands, in this regard, the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan, accompanied by deployment of international forces to be organised with respect of the UN Charter to provide the necessary security guarantees in a period of transition, which will ensure the security of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and allow the displaced persons to return to their homes and further conflicts caused by homelessness to be prevented. EU Activities to Support Democratisation, Good Governance and the Rule of Law Support to good governance, the rule of law and democratisation has been constantly identified as a core priority in major policy documents in all three countries. In the Country Reports prepared by the European Commission in 2005, political, rule of law and human rights issues were highlighted as areas where reforms should markedly be strengthened and where co-operation with the EU should develop for all three Caucasus countries. They were subsequently identified as core priorities in the Action Plans signed with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in 2006.Delcor-Duhot, ibid, p.22 EU policy stresses that democratisation, good governance, political pluralism, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are of paramount importance for determining the future relations of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia with the EU; calls for renewed efforts by the countries to implement in full the ENP Action Plans and calls on the Commission to continue to assist them in such efforts; is concerned by the limited progress made by the countries in the South Caucasus region in this area, as shown in the Commission 2009 progress reports and reflected in Council of Europe recommendations; welcomes the initiation of the human rights dialogues between the EU and Georgia and Armenia and invites Azerbaijan and the EU to finalise discussions on an equivalent co-operation structure.

The label is managed by the EFQUEL, and was co-developed by the MENON Network, EFMD, and Europace. The quality of both products and programmes in the field of technology-enhanced learning varies widely. The UNIQUe quality label is a unique concept of quality improvement which is theoretically sound and at the same time is meeting the expectations of practice. Many of the existing quality initiatives in this field focus heavily, if not solely, on online instructional design. The UNIQUe approach goes above and beyond this, focusing on the use of ICT to enhance educational provision and learning support, throughout the entire breadth of activity of the Higher Education Institution. This sophisticated approach demands an applicant to meet high- quality standards for programme objectives, programme structure, content, resources and learning processes. For Who The fundamental feature of the UNIQUe approach is to support institutions of higher education to measure how successful they are in technology-enhanced learning and to allow for continuous improvement. Thus, \\\\- UNIQUe is an accelerator for quality improvement and innovation. \\\\- Providing industry-wide benchmarks, it will dramatically enhance the implementation speed of the Bologna reforms in the area of technology-enhanced learning. \\\\- Compared to other quality initiatives in the area of technology-enhanced learning, UNIQUe has a broader institutional approach and is not only related to e Learning. The - Unique quality label builds on the broadest stakeholder involvement. \\\\- The UNIQUe process is structured in six very distinct stages and offers a formalized approach in each of the steps. \\\\- The UNIQUe quality label provides a certification as a result, next to continuous quality improvement mechanisms. \\\\- The UNIQUe quality label focuses on innovation. UNIQUe ensures continuous quality improvement since it is a diagnostic tool for self-assessment of the institution. The process The UNIQUe Process is made up of six steps, namely: 1 ‚Äì Application 2 ‚Äì Eligibility: The Institution is checked for overall compliance with the UNIQUe scheme 3 ‚Äì Self-Assessment: The institution embarks on a process of self-analysis and assessment, completing a questionnaire about its processes, and submitting back to a review team. 4 ‚Äì Peer Review: A three-person review team visits the Institution, to check compliance with the UNIQUe Criteria. 5 ‚Äì Awarding Body: An independent awarding body, recommends certification or rejection, based upon the recommendation of the reviewers. 6 ‚Äì Continuous Quality Improvement: the institution's development of ICT policies is continuously monitored, in line with recommendations made by the review team.

He was the son of a business manager, Gustaf Envall, and Bertha Svedberg. Early career After his ordination in Gothenburg in 1934, Envall served as a missionary of the Church of Sweden Mission in South India from 1937 to 1954. He then returned to Sweden and served as the vicar in the parish of Foss in Bohusl√§n. Serving in Malaya He was asked to serve as the superintendent of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore in 1961 and was elected and consecrated as the bishop of the church in 1965 and 1966 respectively.Evangelical Lutheran Church in Malaysia: History of the ELCM Attempts at Lutheran unity in Malaya Envall was instrumental in initiating a consultative dialogue between the congregations established by missionaries of the United Lutheran Church in America among the ethnic Chinese and the Tamil congregations led by the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Swedish mission in Malaya with the intention of establishing a single Lutheran church in Malaya. Despite agreeing on organisation and stewardship in general, disagreements arose upon the form of church government for the proposed national church. While the Swedish mission and the Tamil Lutherans was partial to an episcopal polity, it was not accepted by the representatives of the American mission who felt that the local Chinese Lutherans would not be familiar with that form of government. There were also disagreements on the nature of apostolic succession as well as the significant differences in the culture, language and origins between the Tamils and Chinese who were ministered by the respective missions, the former consisting mainly of established Tamil Lutheran families while the latter consisted mainly of congregations of young individual Chinese who were first generation Christians.Warren, Lau: \\"A Heavenly Vision - The Story of the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore, 1952 - 1991\\". 1993, As a result, two Lutheran church bodies were established in Malaya; the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church districts in Malaya were reconstituted as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore (ELCMS) on 13 August 1962 whereas the mainly Chinese congregations of the American Mission was organised the Lutheran Church in Malaya (later renamed the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and after Singapore's independence in 1965, the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore) a year later on 3 August 1963.Vierow, Duain William.

Although it is a completely different ester, propyl hexanoate shares the same chemical formula with methyl octanoate, ethyl heptanoate, butyl pentanoate, etc. because they all have the same total carbon chain length. The scent of this ester can be described as that of blackberries, pineapple, cheese or wine.The Good Scents Company Properties Due to the length of the carbon chain in this molecule, there are only minor van der Waals forces acting upon it, which is why propyl hexanoate appears as a liquid and not a solid. Dipole-dipole forces are present because of the polar covalent bonds between carbon and oxygen, while hydrogen bonding only occurs with other molecules that can hydrogen bond. Preparation Propyl hexanoate is formed by the condensation reaction (esterification) of propanol and hexanoic acid. The hydroxyl group from the propanol reacts with the hydroxyl group from the hexanoic acid to produce water and leave an oxygen that the parent acid and alcohol chains bond to, creating the ester. For this reaction to occur, it requires an acid catalyst, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, and heat.Clark, J. (2004). Making Esters. Chemguide The esterification process can also be reversed (hydrolysis) to get propanol and hexanoic acid back from propyl hexanoate. This reaction occurs between the ester and water in the presence of a dilute acid catalyst and heat.Clark, J. (2004). Hydrolysing Esters. Chemguide Uses Propyl hexanoate, being an ester, is generally used for replicating the scents or flavors of fruit such as blackberry and pineapple, then is added to things such as food or perfume.

The company was initially founded for the management of Section 8 subsidized housing, most of which was financed with FHA-insured loans (ie., 221 (d)( 4), 223(f), and 236). However, since then, the focus has been on high-end, luxury apartments in suitable neighborhoods as well as managing 221(d)(4) and 223(f) market rent projects. Herbert Newman, born and raised in Akron, Ohio, started his career from Northeast Ohio after graduating from Ohio State University and receiving a Juris Doctor from the University of Akron School of Law.https://www.linkedin.com/company/summit- management-services-inc After his law practice, Newman served as director of Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority for five years. As a part of this organization, Newman introduced the use of tax-free financing for the development of subsidized housing.http://www.abettermontrose.com/Documents/WestSideLeader-10-07-2010.pdfhttp://www.ohio.com/editorial/herb- newman-wild-west-comes-to-montrose-1.244629 This was done by using revenue bonds sold under Federal Housing Regulation 811(b), which was also partially authored by Newman. Before founding the company, Newman wrote many of the laws that govern HUD/FHA financing. These lead to the development of housing during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This knowledge was then imparted to Summit MultiCapital to obtain favorable debt financing through FHA/Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other financial institutions. Summit Management Services, Inc. now employs 120 full-time staff and Newman remains the majority stockholder.

He is best known for his invention of logics of proofs and justifications.  Research  In the area of proof theory, Artemov established the impossibility of finding a complete axiom system for first- order provability logic (1985) and has pioneered studies of the logic of proofs. His major accomplishments include the solution of a problem that was discussed by G√∂del in the 1930s: Artemov provided a provability semantics for modal logic that also served as a formalization of the Brouwer‚ÄìHeyting‚ÄìKolmogorov provability semantics for intuitionistic logic (1995). He later offered a general logical theory of justification that renders a new, evidence-based foundation for epistemic logic (2007‚Äì2008). The notion of justification has been an essential element of epistemic studies since Plato, but was, prior to Artemov's work, conspicuously absent in logical models of knowledge. Artemov, along with researchers from Stanford and Cornell, initiated studies of dynamic topological logic (1997) which has since become an active research area with applications in control theory. In epistemic game theory, he has offered a new, knowledge-based approach to rationality (2009); this is currently a work in progress.  Biography  Sergei Artemov was born in Uralsk, USSR, now Kazakhstan, in 1951 to Nikolai and Raisa Artemov, respectively a senior engineer and the manager of a technical college. He graduated from Moscow University with honors in 1975, going on to earn his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1980. His mentor at Moscow University was Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov,http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=83475 considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.  Academic career  Artemov was a researcher at the Institute of Control Sciences in Moscow from 1978‚Äì1980 and since 1980 has been a researcher at the Steklov Mathematical Institute (Moscow) where, in 1988, he completed his Doctor of Sciences degree. He has also been a faculty member at the department of mathematics of Moscow University since 1984, becoming a full professor (1993) as well as the founder and head of a laboratory of logical problems in computer science (1994). Artemov has been an editor for several leading outlets in this area, including the Annals of Pure and Applied Logic and the monograph series Studies in Logic and Foundations of Mathematics.

It was launched as a bi-monthly title in 2004 by Coastal Living Ltd, and was then published by Edisea Ltd, until UK publishing company National Magazines (now Hearst Communications) bought it in 2005. National Magazines continued to publish it bi-monthly as a sister title to Country Living magazine. It increased the number of issues published per year to ten in 2007. The Magazine was taken over by current publishers Kelsey Media in November 2012. The number of issues published per year was increased to twelve in 2014. Coast covers all aspects of living by the sea: homes, gardens, travel, food and health. The Coast Awards Every year the magazine celebrates the best of the British coastline in the Coast Awards, sponsored by Joules Clothing. The winners of each of the ten categories are usually announced in the June issue of the magazine. From 2008-2011, the Awards have been reader nominated and a panel of expert judges has decided on the winners from a short list. Past presenters of the Coast Awards ceremony have included Michaela Strachan and Julia Bradbury. Campaigns In 2009 Coast launched a campaign to Save the Seaside Postcard. This attracted widespread media attention including an appearance by editor Clare Gogerty on the Today programme on Radio 4, and on BBC Breakfast. In The Great Seaside Poster Revival (June 2010), seven artists (Rob Ryan, Angie Lewin, Barbara Hulanicki, Nick Higgins, Wayne and Gerardine Hemingway, Andy Tuohy and Christopher Wormell) were asked to reinvent the seaside poster to publicise a chosen resort. The original artwork of each of these posters was auctioned on eBay with funds raised (¬£5,000) going to the Marine Conservation Society. Readers also submitted their own designs in a related competition. In March 2011, Coast launched The Great Pier Promenade to raise funds towards the restoration of Hastings Pier, which was devastated by a fire in October 2010. The magazine called upon readers to walk as many UK pleasure piers as possible during spring/summer 2011, and to get themselves sponsored. Reader Events Coast holds an annual beach clean in collaboration with the Marine Conservation Society. Beaches cleaned so far: Southwold, East Wittering, Holkham and Weston-super-Mare (May 2011). Further events include: An annual coastal walk; a reader Learn to Sail Day; a day out at the De La Warr Pavilion. Competitions An annual photographic competition (results announced in March issue). A Coast Quilt competition held in association with Runaway Coast. Awards Won Coast won Best Specialist Consumer Magazine at the PPA Awards in 2009.

The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season, Debra originated from the interaction of a cold-core low and a tropical wave on July 15\\\\. The system was designated a tropical depression on July 23 when it was south of Louisiana and meandered westward while it swiftly intensified into a tropical storm along the Gulf Coast of the United States. A turn towards the northwest became evident as it attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale the following day while it organized into a developed storm. As the hurricane curved northward at a slow forward speed, strength was maintained as it approached the coast of Texas as a minimal hurricane. It came ashore during the evening of July 24 local time (0000 UTC on July 25) between Freeport and Galveston, Texas. It rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland, and dissipated on July 28 while it turned northwestward. The remnant moisture later sparked upper-level thunderstorms in late July and early August. Prior to Debra's arrival in Texas, numerous hurricane warnings were issued and at least 8,600 individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. Sea vessels took the brunt of the storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11 injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90 cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685 million, and total damage from the storm reached $7 million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued, and those that were had been delivered in a timely manner.  Meteorological history  Debra's origins were from an area of convection over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July 15\\\\. Whilst under the influence of a subtropical ridge‚Äìor a belt of high pressure‚Äìit slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July 20\\\\. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900 EST (0100 UTC on July 21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July 23 as winds of 22‚Äì30 knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. The storm attained tropical characteristics near 0000 UTC while situated south of Louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression. Ship communications off the coast on July 24 relayed winds of 23‚Äì50 knots and a barometric pressure of 1007.5 mbar (29.75 inHg), which indicated it was a tropical storm on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. Radar imagery taken near 0733 CST (1333 UTC) from a Dow Chemical plant in Freeport, Texas evidenced that Debra was a full-fledged Category 1 hurricane on the scale, with a prominent spiral appearance that was not perceived by the radar the previous afternoon. As the result of a polar trough aloft in the central United States, Debra curved northward though its winds shifted southward, defying the earlier prediction of a bend west-northwest to northwest. A reconnaissance flight determined the location of its center during the mid-morning, and the hurricane made landfall near its peak intensity between Freeport and Galveston, Texas during the evening of July 24 local time (0000 UTC on July 25). It rapidly weakened on July 26 while it arched west-northwest, though it maintained tropical characteristics until its dissipation on July 28 over central Oklahoma while the system progressed north-northwestward. As it moved inland, moisture along its eastern fringe converged with a front to its northeast, causing heavy rains that were confined to limited areas in northeast Louisiana and southern Arkansas; they eventually traversed east- northeastward over northern Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Moisture and instability from Debra led to high-level thunderstorms in Montana and northern Idaho on July 31 and August 1. Hurricane Debra's development near the coast was unusual, complicating forecasting in addition to its rapid intensification and abnormal direction. The lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from those that were received further complicated Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.  Preparations  The Weather Bureau in New Orleans, Louisiana issued small craft warnings at 1230 UTC on July 24 stretching from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas, while \\"whole gale warnings\\" were posted from Port O'Connor to Matagorda, Texas with regular gale warnings extending north to Freeport, Texas at 1500 UTC. A hurricane warning was later declared for areas between Matagorda to High Island at 2130 UTC, which was published at 2200 UTC. Warnings were widely distributed through radio services (including KGBC, KILE, KTLW, WBRZ, and KIOX), newspapers, bulletin boards, telegraph via the Western Union, regional teleprinters, the Chamber of Commerce's storm board, and storm warning displays. Several thousand citizens sought shelter at public facilities, including schools and courthouses. Approximately 1,000 inhabitants of Surfside Beach evacuated amid the threat of Debra. Between two and three thousand fled to Angleton, and another 1,000 fled to Freeport. An estimate said that at least 2,500 people left the Galveston Bay area; another 1,100 stayed in the Brazoria County Courthouse and 1,000 residents took shelter in public buildings in Galveston. Numerous others moved from resort towns into other areas.  Impact   Texas Rainfall produced by Hurricane Debra The highest reported winds were estimated at 80‚Äì90 mph (130‚Äì150 km/h), with gusts up to 105 mph (165 km/h) at the Brazos River floodgates near Freeport. Tides were to at Galveston Bay; Morgan Point measured the highest tides, at above normal. Overall, the storm surge was about high; near Harrisburg, Houston, its height was approximately ; around the Kemah-Seabrook area, the storm surge was , while along the Dickinson Bayou they were to above average. Alongside the Gulf Coast, especially in Texas, there were widespread measurements of heavy rainfall, which included a total of at Orange, Texas, which led to the inundation low-lying streets; this total was the highest attributed to Debra. A daily rainfall record of was achieved at Beaumont, and hurricane-force winds stretched inland. The simultaneous occurrence of a storm surge and heavy rainfall wrought by Debra led to widespread flooding on highways, including that on Highway 75 northwest of Galveston on July 25 which caused the detachment of Galveston Island from the mainland for several hours. Other major roadways flooded were Highway 6 between Hitchcock and Galveston; Highway 146 from Kemah to Seabrook; and Farm Road 518 extending from Kemah through League City. An unconfirmed report indicated that a funnel cloud briefly touched down roughly northwest of Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport at approximately 0027 UTC, though no damage occurred. A plane thrown into a ditch by the hurricane The majority of private piers situated upon the western and northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed as a result of Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90 cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to the Tabernacle Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants littering the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to sea vessels was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides was evident in the Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised not to touch downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted. One person went missing in Texas City, and several others were unaccounted for at other areas. There, damage to houses and other structures totaled several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although 16 shops were damaged, no homes suffered any damage. Crop damage in Brazoria County also reached hundreds of thousands of dollars. A boat captain was hurt when his vessel crashed into a rock jetty under waves of . A tower tall utilized for the purpose of hoisting storm warning flags in Freeport was demolished, and damage within the city involved broken windows and roof shingles, in addition to the power outages that occurred. Automobiles were blown onto the city's roads, and Second Street, the city's primary street, was below of floodwaters; the costs of the overall effects from Debra in Freeport were estimated at $300,000, although then-mayor Jim Russell claimed that damage could reach $1.5 million. Damage at La Marque (then known as Lamarque) totaled to as much as $1 million. Reports asserted that one person was engulfed and died offshore the Freeport area, but they were unconfirmed; another individual and their daughter previously listed as missing in the city were discovered at Houston. Several other individuals were reported as missing, including four on a vessel offshore Freeport and one in Texas City. Another two were unaccounted for in Green Lake. A night club at Clute burst into flames during the hurricane and winds created the possibility of the blaze spreading, although it was dealt with after several firemen came to the location. Debra destroyed approximately 1,000 piers of a small size at La Porte. A shrimp boat and two other watercraft were known to be in difficult situations, while another sent out a distress call claiming that the boat's fuel tank had dismantled from it and its crew was anticipating an explosion. A Coast Guard aircraft searched for the shrimping boat Rosina after it had begun to dismantle while a Coast Guard buoy identified as the Blackthorn probed for the Cain Hoy, although the three on board the Rosina were later recovered. All vessels reported as missing were recovered by the Coast Guard on July 25. A ship known as Hope with a crew of three was thrown ashore southeast of Freeport, but the United States Coast Guard was incapable of rescuing the craft and its shipmembers. Tornadoes touched down near the then-Jefferson County Airport, Sebastian, and Kenedy, with the first associated with the precursor to Debra. In all, damage in Brazoria, Galveston, and the eastern part of Harris counties totaled $6.7 million, while damage elsewhere increased the total to $7 million. 10 people suffered minor injuries in Brazoria County, in addition to one off the coast.  Elsewhere  In Oklahoma, torrential rainfall produced floods in small areas of the state, especially the southeast, east-, north-, and north-central portions of the state. Two tornadoes touched down in Kiowa and Caddo counties, with the prior tracking , resulting in minimal damage. In Stillwater, three consecutive hours of torrential rains led to an inundation of as observed by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Heavy rainfall also occurred in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. Debra sparked high- level thunderstorms in Montana and northern Idaho, eventually leading to wildfires.  Aftermath  An editorial published in the Houston Chronicle criticized the lack of warnings prior to Hurricane Debra's arrival in Texas, alleging that with radar, aircraft, and communication systems, the Weather Bureau should have been able to give a warning well in advance of the storm. The article remarked that the Bureau \\"seemed almost as uninformed as the ordinary citizen\\" in regards to the forecasting. The chief of the Weather Bureau, Stephen Lichtblau, fired back, saying that \\"we were fortunate to get a warning.\\" He continued \\"had [the Weather Bureau] not had...[such] equipment they are complaining about, we could have [released] nothing,\\" and maintained that warnings were issued promptly. When repairs in Calhoun County, Texas were completed in 1961, Hurricane Carla struck shortly thereafter in September.

Founded in 1946 as the Serbian Writers' Association's (UKS) eatery, over time, the club managed to develop a unique identity outside of its umbrella organization. Originally only accessible to association members who had to show their cards to get in, it eventually became open to the general public. The restaurant is located in the basement of a neoclassical building at 7 Francuska Street, which also houses the Writers Association upstairs. Special part of Klub knji≈æevnika's lore are its famous patrons. In addition to an endless list of Serbian and Yugoslav writers who frequented the restaurant over the years such as Momo Kapor, Bogdan Tirnaniƒá, Ivo Andriƒá, Danilo Ki≈°, Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá, Miodrag Bulatoviƒá, Matija Beƒákoviƒá, Miroslav Krle≈æa, Milo≈° Crnjanski, Borislav Mihajloviƒá Mihiz, Du≈°ko Radoviƒá, Predrag Palavestra, Mirko Kovaƒç, Zuko D≈æumhur, Borislav Pekiƒá, etc., Klub knji≈æevnika was often visited by various other artists, politicians, journalists, and diplomats. Location The 7 Francuska Street building where the restaurant is located was erected during the late 1850s‚ÄûKlub knji≈æevnika‚Äù u Francuskoj ulici dobija novog gazdu;Politika, 2 August 2008 by a wealthy Serbian merchant named Peƒáanac. The building later housed the Turkish embassy, then the American embassy before eventually becoming the Auto Club during interbellum. History Established in 1946, Klub knji≈æevnika initially served as hangout for writers from the association upstairs who used the basement facilities for literary presentations and book promotions. At first only coffee, and occasionally fruit snacks, were served. Sometime in 1952 the menu expanded to include simple soups and salads as food now began to be served on regular basis. Two years later, in 1954, the club opened its doors to the general public. Managed at the time by Ivo Kusaliƒá and Nikola Bosanac it quickly established itself as the place to be among the country's main decision makers, and thus began to be frequented by top Yugoslav communist political and military officials such as the foreign minister Koƒça Popoviƒá, Rodoljub ƒåolakoviƒá, Dra≈æa Markoviƒá, general Peko Dapƒçeviƒá, etc. In 1957 with the arrival of Budimir \\"Buda\\" Blagojeviƒá to the management team, the restaurant got the recognizable duo of Buda and Ivo that would run the place in hands-on manner for the following 30+ years. It would only open at night (operating six days a week, closed on Sundays) with first patrons usually slowly arriving around 8pm. In addition to writers and politicians, the smoke-filled basement facility proved popular with various artists - painters, sculptors, actors, and film directors. Since the demand far outstripped the seating capacity of its facilities, getting a table at Klub knji≈æevnika became a matter of prestige.

The restaurant was often the site of fierce debate. Therefore, like other famous kafane in communist Yugoslavia, Klub knji≈æevnika also featured police informants dressed in civilian clothing, mingling in with other patrons, listening to vox populi and reporting potentially incendiary talk and ideas to their higher ups. In his NIN column from 2009, Momo Kapor wrote about his fellow writer and drinking buddy Miodrag Bulatoviƒá getting detained in 1966 after an informant at Klub knji≈æevnika reported Bulatoviƒá for \\"criticizing the economic reforms introduced in 1964\\".Pesnici pred sudom ;NIN, 15 April 2009 On occasion, a quarrel between writers themselves would cross the line.

Terry Kee Buck Hwa.Lutheran Church in Singapore - Bishop's Message History Early history The Lutheran Church in Singapore shares its early history with the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore (LCMS). In 1960, the American Lutheran mission in Malaya built a church at Duke's Road in Bukit Timah together with two other small Lutheran congregations from the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Huria Kristen Batak Protestant in Singapore. Worship services in English, Chinese, Tamil and Batak were held in the church. With the onset of the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, many of the Batak members returned to Indonesia in 1963 and the remaining Batak parishioners decided to worship at the Methodist Church in Short Street.Warren, Lau: \\"A Heavenly Vision - The Story of the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore, 1952 - 1991\\". 1993, In 1963, a second congregation was established in Queenstown and the mission was able to obtain one of the six religious sites allocated in Queenstown through the help of a member of the Batak congregation. The congregations in Singapore were grouped as the Singapore District, one of the three constituent districts of the LCMS. Towards autonomy By 1973, the then President of the LCMS, Dr. Carl Fisher raised the question of whether the Lutheran churches in Singapore would operate as a national church separate from the LCMS. The matter was not pursued further until 1984, when the matter was brought up again during a meeting with the Singapore District Council of the LCMS. Even then, this matter was again not pursued further. In February 1990, the issue of an independent Lutheran Church in Singapore was again brought into discussion by the Executive Council of the LCMS. This time the issue was given more serious thought, particularly since it was noted that the clergy representing the Singapore District in the LCMS' Executive Council were both not Singaporean citizens. One of the results of this discussion was the establishment of a Restructuring Committee to study the restructuring of the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore. Each district of the LCMS was also to form its own ad hoc committee to study the matter. A meeting was convened on the 1st and 2 April 1991 as the LCMS Restructuring Consultation in Port Dickson, Malaysia to present the combined studies and recommendations. It was agreed in principle that the Singapore District would function as a fully autonomous Singaporean Lutheran Church, working side by side with her Malaysian counterpart. A ten-year time frame was adopted in which the Lutheran Church in Singapore and the Lutheran Church in Malaysia would initially be re- organised as two synods within one Church organisation and move towards independence as two national churches by 2001. Establishment of a national church Despite the ten year time frame, the process was accelerated and in 1997, the Lutheran Church in Singapore was constituted as a separate national body for Lutheran churches in Singapore with the Rt. Rev. John Tan Yok Han elected as the first Bishop of the church.Lutheran Church in Singapore - About Us Structure and Organisation The Lutheran Church in Singapore' structure evolved from being the Southern District of the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore to a national body. The highest decision making body is the Annual Meeting consisting of elected lay and ordained voting members from each congregation that meets annually and headed by a Bishop. When the Annual Meeting is in recess, authority is delegated to the Executive Council. The Ministerium, consisting of the ordained pastors of the church, attends to matters of doctrine, nurture and spiritual care.

The bill passed the U.S. House on December 14, 2011, the U.S. Senate on December 15, 2011, and was signed into United States law on December 31, 2011, by President Barack Obama. The Act authorizes $662 billion in funding, among other things \\"for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad\\".

The Act also increases pay and healthcare costs for military service members and gives governors the ability to request the help of military reservists in the event of a hurricane, earthquake, flood, terrorist attack, or other disaster. The most controversial provisions to receive wide attention were contained in subsections 1021‚Äì1022 of Title X, Subtitle D, entitled \\"Counter- Terrorism\\", authorizing the indefinite military detention of persons the government suspects of involvement in terrorism, including U.S. citizens arrested on American soil. Although the White House and Senate sponsors maintain that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) already grants presidential authority for indefinite detention, the Act states that Congress \\"affirms\\" this authority and makes specific provisions as to the exercise of that authority.Khalek, Rania, \\"Global Battlefield' Provision Allowing Indefinite Detention of Citizens Accused of Terror Could Pass This Week\\", Alternet, December 13, 2011.Library of Congress THOMAS. H.R. 1540 ‚Äì National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 Versions of H.R.1540. The detention provisions of the Act have received critical attention by, among others, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, and some media sources which are concerned about the scope of the President's authority, including contentions that those whom they claim may be held indefinitely could include U.S. citizens arrested on American soil, including arrests by members of the Armed Forces.Carter, Tom \\"US Senators back law authorizing indefinite military detention without trial or charge,\\" World Socialist Web Site, December 2, 2011. The detention powers currently face legal challenge. Detention without trial: Section 1021 The detention sections of the NDAA begin by \\"affirm[ing]\\" that the authority of the President under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF), a joint resolution passed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, includes the power to detain, via the Armed Forces, any person, including a U.S. citizen, \\"who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners\\", and anyone who commits a \\"belligerent act\\" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, \\"without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the [AUMF]\\".

Addressing previous conflicts with the Obama Administration regarding the wording of the Senate text, the Senate‚ÄìHouse compromise text, in sub-section 1021(d), also affirms that nothing in the Act \\"is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force\\". The final version of the bill also provides, in sub-section(e), that \\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States\\". As reflected in Senate debate over the bill, there is a great deal of controversy over the status of existing law. An amendment to the Act that would have replaced current text with a requirement for executive clarification of detention authorities was rejected by the Senate.\\"Senate Poised to Pass Indefinite Detention Without Charge or Trial\\", American Civil Liberties Union, December 1, 2011. According to Senator Carl Levin, \\"the language which precluded the application of section 1031 to American Citizens was in the bill that we originally approved in the Armed Services Committee and the Administration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S. citizens and lawful residents would not be subject to this section\\".Senate Session ‚Äì C-SPAN Video Library The Senator refers to section 1021 as \\"1031\\" because it was section 1031 at the time of his speaking. Requirement for military custody: Section 1022 Camp X-Ray, January 2002. In May 2006, the UN Committee against Torture condemned prisoners' treatment at Guant√°namo Bay, noting that indefinite detention constitutes per se a violation of the UN Convention Against Torture. All persons arrested and detained according to the provisions of section 1021, including those detained on U.S. soil, whether detained indefinitely or not, are required to be held by the United States Armed Forces. The law affords the option to have U.S. citizens detained by the armed forces but this requirement does not extend to them, as with foreign persons. Lawful resident aliens may or may not be required to be detained by the Armed Forces, \\"on the basis of conduct taking place within the United States\\".McGreal, Chris, \\"Military given go-ahead to detain US terrorist suspects without trial,\\" The Guardian, 14 December 2011: .Greenwald, Glenn, \\"Obama to sign indefinite detention bill into law,\\" Salon.com, 14 December 2011: . During debate on the senate floor, Levin stated that \\"Administration officials reviewed the draft language for this provision and recommended additional changes. We were able to accommodate those recommendations, except for the Administration request that the provision apply only to detainees captured overseas and there's a good reason for that. Even here, the difference is modest, because the provision already excludes all U.S. citizens. It also excludes lawful residents of United States, except to extent permitted by the constitution. The only covered persons left are those who are illegally in this country or on a tourist visa or other short-term basis. Contrary to some press statements, the detainee provisions in our bill do not include new authority for the permanent detention of suspected terrorists. Rather, the bill uses language provided by the Administration to codify existing authority that has been upheld in federal courts\\". A Presidential Policy Directive entitled \\"Requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act\\" regarding the procedures for implementing ¬ß1022 of the NDAA was issued on February 28, 2012, by the White House. The directive consists of eleven pages of specific implementation procedures including defining scope and limitations. Judge Kathrine B. Forrest wrote in Hedges v. Obama: \\"That directive provides specific guidance as to the 'Scope of Procedures and Standard for Covered Persons Determinations.' Specifically, it states that 'covered persons' applies only to a person who is not a citizen of the United States and who is a member or part of al-Qaeda or an associated force that acts in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda; and \\"who participated in the course of planning or carrying out an attack or attempted attack against the United States or its coalition partners\\" (see p. 11‚Äì12). Under procedures released by the White House the military custody requirement can be waived in a wide variety of cases. Among the waiver possibilities are the following: * The suspect's home country objects to military custody * The suspect is arrested for conduct conducted in the United States * The suspect is originally charged with a non-terrorism offense * The suspect was originally arrested by state or local law enforcement * A transfer to military custody could interfere with efforts to secure cooperation or confession * A transfer would interfere with a joint trial Actions from the White House and Senate leading to the vote The White House threatened to veto the Senate version of the Act, arguing in an executive statement on November 17, 2011, that while \\"the authorities granted by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, including the detention authority ... are essential to our ability to protect the American people ... (and) Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary and poses some risk\\". The statement furthermore objected to the mandate for \\"military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects\\", which it called inconsistent with \\"the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets\\". The White House may now waive the requirement for military custody for some detainees following a review by appointed officials including the Attorney General, the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security, the chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. During debate within the Senate and before the Act's passage, Senator Mark Udall introduced an amendment interpreted by the ACLU and some news sources as an effort to limit military detention of American citizens indefinitely and without trial. The amendment proposed to strike the section \\"Detainee Matters\\" from the bill, and replace section 1021 (then titled 1031) with a provision requiring the Administration to clarify the Executive's authority to detain suspects on the basis of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.Udall Amendment Text for SA 1107. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 60‚Äì38 (with 2 abstaining).U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 112th Congress ‚Äì 1st Session Udall subsequently voted for the Act in the joint session of Congress that passed it, and though he remained \\"extremely troubled\\" by the detainee provisions, he promised to \\"push Congress to conduct the maximum amount of oversight possible\\".\\"Despite concerns, Udall gives nod to Defense Authorization bill.\\" Denver Post, December 15, 2011.

After a Senate‚ÄìHouse compromise text explicitly ruled out any limitation of the President's authorities, but also removed the requirement of military detention for terrorism suspects arrested in the United States, the White House issued a statement saying that it would not veto the bill. In his Signing Statement, President Obama explained: \\"I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, crucial services for service members and their families, and vital national security programs that must be renewed ... I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists\\".

Barry Wingard, a military attorney representing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp, noted that under the NDAA \\"an American citizen can be detained forever without trial, while the allegations against you go uncontested because you have no right to see them\\". Views of the Obama Administration On December 31, 2011, and after signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 into law, President Obama issued a statement on it addressing \\"certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of terrorism suspects\\". In the statement the President maintains that \\"the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the 2001 AUMF\\". The statement also maintains that the \\"Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens\\", and that it \\"will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law\\". Referring to the applicability of civilian versus military detention, the statement argued that \\"the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa'ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical, guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each system. Otherwise, investigations could be compromised, our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized, and intelligence could be lost\\". On February 22, 2012, the Administration represented by Jeh Charles Johnson, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Defense defined the term \\"associated forces\\". Johnson stated in a speech at Yale Law School: On February 28, 2012, the administration announced that it would waive the requirement for military detention in \\"any case in which officials [believe] that placing a detainee in military custody could impede counterterrorism cooperation with the detainee's home government or interfere with efforts to secure the person's cooperation or confession\\". Application of military custody to any suspect is determined by a national security team including the attorney general, the secretaries of state, defense, and homeland security, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of National Intelligence. On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest issued an injunction against the indefinite detention provisions of the NDAA (section 1021(b)(2)) on the grounds of unconstitutionality; however, this injunction was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the following day and was later reversed. The Administration explained on November 6, 2012, the terms \\"substantially supported\\" and \\"associated forces\\" in its opening brief before the U.S. Second Court of Appeals in Hedges v. Obama. With respect to the term \\"substantially supported\\" the Obama administration stated: And with respect to the term \\"associated forces\\", the Administration cited the above-mentioned Jeh Johnson's remarks on February 22, 2012: The Administration summarized later in its brief that: NBC News released in February 2014 an undated U.S. Department of Justice White paper entitled \\"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa'ida or An Associated Force.\\" In it the Justice Department stated with respect to the term \\"associated forces\\" Legal arguments that the legislation does not allow the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens Mother Jones wrote that the Act \\"is the first concrete gesture Congress has made towards turning the homeland into the battlefield\\", arguing that \\"codifying indefinite detention on American soil is a very dangerous step\\". The magazine has nevertheless contested claims by The Guardian and the New York Times that the Act \\"allows the military to indefinitely detain without trial American terrorism suspects arrested on U.S. soil who could then be shipped to Guant√°namo Bay\\", writing that \\"they're simply wrong ... It allows people who think the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks gives the president the authority to detain U.S. citizens without charge or trial to say that, but it also allows people who can read the Constitution of the United States to argue something else\\". Legal commentator Joanne Mariner has noted in Verdict that the scope of existing detention power under the AUMF is \\"subject to vociferous debate and continuing litigation\\". In the years that followed the September 11 attacks, the AUMF was interpreted to allow the indefinite detention of both citizens and non-citizens arrested far from any traditional battlefield, including in the United States. Other legal commentators argue that the NDAA does not permit truly \\"indefinite\\" detention, given that the period of detention is limited by the duration of the armed conflict. In making this claim, they emphasize the difference between (1) detention pursuant to the \\"laws of war\\" and (2) detention pursuant to domestic criminal law authorities. \\"Rivkin & Casey, Bill's detainee provisions reaffirm the laws of war.\\" David B. Rivkin and Lee Casey, for example, argue that detention under the AUMF is authorized under the laws of war and is not indefinite because the authority to detain ends with the cessation of hostilities. They argue that the NDAA invokes \\"existing Supreme Court precedent ... that clearly permits the military detention (and even trial) of citizens who have themselves engaged in hostile acts or have supported such acts to the extent that they are properly classified as 'combatants' or 'belligerents'\\". This reflects the fact that, in their view, the United States is, pursuant to the AUMF, at war with al-Qaeda, and detention of enemy combatants in accordance with the laws of war is authorized. In their view, this does not preclude trial in civilian courts, but it does not require that the detainee be charged and tried. If the detainee is an enemy combatant who has not violated the laws of war, he is not chargeable with any triable offense. Commentators who share this view emphasize the need not to blur the distinction between domestic criminal law and the laws of war.ICRC official statement: The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism, 21 July 2005 Legal arguments that the legislation allows indefinite detention The American Civil Liberties Union has stated that \\"While President Obama issued a signing statement saying he had 'serious reservations' about the provisions, the statement only applies to how his administration would use the authorities granted by the NDAA\\", and, despite claims to the contrary, \\"The statute contains a sweeping worldwide indefinite detention provision ... [without] temporal or geographic limitations, and can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield\\". The ACLU also maintains that \\"the breadth of the NDAA's detention authority violates international law because it is not limited to people captured in the context of an actual armed conflict as required by the laws of war\\".\\"President Obama Signs Indefinite Detention Bill Into Law\\", ACLU, 31 December 2011. Proposed legislative reforms Following the passage of the NDAA, various proposals have been offered to clarify the detainee provisions. One example, H.R. 3676, sponsored by U.S. Representative Jeff Landry of Louisiana, would amend the NDAA \\"to specify that no U.S. citizen may be detained against his or her will without all the rights of due process\\".Library of Congress: Thomas. Other similar bills in the U.S. House of Representatives have been introduced by Representatives John Garamendi of California and Chris Gibson of New York. The Feinstein-Lee Amendment that would have explicitly barred the military from holding American citizens and permanent residents in indefinite detention without trial as terrorism suspects was dropped on December 18, 2012, during the merging of the House and Senate versions of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Legal challenges to indefinite detention Hedges v. Obama A lawsuit was filed January 13, 2012, against the Obama Administration and Members of the U.S. Congress by a group including former New York Times reporter Christopher Hedges challenging the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The plaintiffs contend that Section 1021(b)(2) of the law allows the detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody in the United States on \\"suspicion of providing substantial support\\" to groups engaged in hostilities against the United States such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In May 2012, a federal court in New York issued a preliminary injunction which temporarily blocked the indefinite detention powers of NDAA Section 1021(b)(2) on the grounds of unconstitutionality. On August 6, 2012, federal prosecutors representing President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, hoping to eliminate the ban. The following day arguments from both sides were heard by U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest during a hearing to determine whether to make her preliminary injunction permanent or not. On September 12, 2012, Judge Forrest issued a permanent injunction, but this was appealed by the Obama Administration on September 13, 2012. A federal appeals court granted a U.S. Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. The court also said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. On October 2, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ban on indefinite detention will not go into effect until a decision on the Obama Administration's appeal is rendered. The U.S. Supreme Court refused on December 14, 2012, to lift the stay pending appeal of the order issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on October 2, 2012. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned on July 17, 2013, the district court's ruling which struck down ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of NDAA as unconstitutional, because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in an order issued April 28, 2014. Critics of the decision quickly pointed out that, without the right to a trial, it is impossible for an individual with legal standing to challenge 1021 without having already been released. States taking action against indefinite detention sections of NDAA As of April 2013, four states have passed resolutions through committee to adjust or block the detainment provisions of the 2012 NDAA and now await a vote. These states are: Arizona, Colorado, Montana, and South Carolina.http://www.pandaunite.org/resources/anti-ndaa-legislativetracking Retrieved 21 May 2013 Pandaunite.org Anti-NDAA legislation has passed the full senate in Indiana by a vote of 31‚Äì17. In Kansas, legislation is waiting for a vote. An additional 13 states have introduced legislation against the detainment provisions: California, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. Counties and municipalities taking action against indefinite detention sections of NDAA Nine counties have passed resolutions against sections 1021 and 1022 of the NDAA. They are: Moffat, Weld, and Fremont counties in Colorado; Harper County, Kansas; Allegan and Oakland counties in Michigan; Alleghany County in North Carolina; and Fulton and Elk counties in Pennsylvania. Resolutions have been introduced in three counties: Barber County, Kansas; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Eleven municipalities have passed resolutions as well. They are: Berkeley, Fairfax, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz, California; Cherokee City, Kansas; Northampton, Massachusetts; Takoma Park, Maryland; Macomb, New York; New Shorehampton, Rhode Island; League City, Texas; and Las Vegas, Nevada (currently waiting on the county to pass a joint resolution). An additional 13 municipalities have introduced anti-NDAA resolutions: San Diego, California; Miami, Florida; Portland, Maine; Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Albany and New York City, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Texas; Springfield, Virginia; and Tacoma, Washington. Northampton, Massachusetts, became the first city in New England to pass a resolution rejecting the NDAA on February 16, 2012. William Newman, Director of the ACLU in western Massachusetts, said, \\"We have a country based on laws and process and fairness. This law is an absolute affront to those principles that make America a free nation\\".Northampton \\"opts out\\" of federal law  WWLP.com Sanctions targeting the Iranian Central Bank As part of the ongoing dispute over Iranian uranium enrichment, section 1245 of the NDAA imposes unilateral sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran, effectively blocking Iranian oil exports to countries which do business with the United States. The new sanctions impose penalties against entities‚Äîincluding corporations and foreign central banks‚Äîwhich engage in transactions with the Iranian central bank. Sanctions on transactions unrelated to petroleum take effect 60 days after the bill is signed into law, while sanctions on transactions related to petroleum take effect a minimum of six months after the bill's signing. The bill grants the U.S. President authority to grant waivers in cases in which petroleum purchasers are unable, due to supply or cost, to significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, or in which American national security is threatened by implementation of the sanctions. Following the signing into law of the NDAA, the Iranian rial fell significantly against the U.S. dollar, reaching a record low two days after the bill's enactment, a change widely attributed to the expected impact of the new sanctions on the Iranian economy. Officials within the Iranian government have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, an important passageway for Middle East oil exports, should the United States press forward with the new sanctions as planned. Military pay and benefits Amendments made to the bill following its passage include a 1.6 percent pay increase for all service members, and an increase in military healthcare enrollment and copay fees. The changes were unanimously endorsed by the Senate Armed Services Committee. See also * Hedges v.

The name Aboakyer translates as \\"hunting for game or animal\\" in the Fante dialect as spoken by the people of the Central Region. The institution of the festival was to commemorate the migration of Simpafo (traditional name given to the people of Winneba). The people migrated from the north-eastern African town of Timbuktu in the ancient Western Sudan Empire to their present land in the central coast of Ghana. The journey from the north-east to the western part of Africa was led by two brothers. The people believed that a god, whom they called Otu, had protected them from all dangers during their migration and to show their appreciation, the people consulted the custodian of the god, a traditional priest who acted as an intermediary between the people and the god, to ask the god for its preferred sacrifice. To their astonishment, the god asked for a human sacrifice, someone from the royal family. This sacrifice went on for some years but was later stopped as the people were no longer interested in human sacrifices. A request was made to the god to change the sacrifice type, as they believed that sacrificing royalty could eventually wipe out the royal family. The god in return asked for type of wild cat to be caught alive and presented to it at its shrine. After the presentation, it was to be beheaded as a sacrifice. This was to be done annually in a festival. Before the festival began the people settled the god at a town called Penkye. After the resettlement, the god became known as Penkyi Otu, to signify the final home for the god. To mark the festival, the people sought out the wild cat, as had been prescribed. Many lives were lost in the process as the animal was to be captured live and transported to Penkye. The people made a second appeal to Penkyi Otu to provide an alternative to the wild cat. That appeal resulted in the decision to accept a mature bushbuck. Two hunting groups, the Tuafo (Number one) and Dentsifo (Number two), have since bore the task of capturing the live bushbuck and presenting it to the people at the durbar. This festival is celebrated in May and it is a major event in Ghana.  How to Watch  watch here Oral tradition The people of Simpa passed on this history to their descendants in the form of songs, and sang it in their war chants and also told it during moonlit nights in story form. This oral tradition went on until the colonial Europeans arrived on the coast of the Gold Coast and with them the English language. Scholars then translated the oral story from the language 'Fante' to English. The festival thumb The festival is celebrated on the first Saturday in May. On the first day of the festival, the two Asaf0Companies (warrior groups) in Winneba take part in a hunting expedition. The first troop to catch a live bushbuck from a game reserve used for this purpose and present it to the chiefs and people at a colorful durbar is declared winner and is highly regarded for bravery. The bushbuck is sacrificed and this signifies the start of the Aboakyer festival. The festival is used also to receive a productive harvest and spiritual guidance from their gods for the coming year.

His paintings, presenting acts of physical, sexual and psychological violence, have raised high emotional responses and controversies. Biography Ophuis lives and works in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam (1988‚Äì1990) and the AKI Academy for Arts and Industrial design in Enschede (1990‚Äì1993). Ophuis often travels to take pictures and to find inspiration for his paintings. In 2003 Ophuis travelled to Srebrenica, where he talked with local people about their situation. The photographs that he made served as inspiration for several paintings. In 2010 he travelled with a camera crew to Sierra Leone, where he interviewed and photographed child- soldiers. This resulted in a series of portraits of child soldiers. Work Representations of pain, suffering and violence, such as the crucifixions, descents from the cross and other biblical scenes have always played a central role in the History of Western Art. The work of Ronald Ophuis can be placed in this Western tradition of painting, but is different in that Ophuis‚Äô scenes take place in our own world, instead of an abstracted, mythical context. In his work Football players I (1996) three young footballers force a teammate to the changing room floor and sodomize him with a Coca-Cola bottle. The recognizable motives such as the changing room, the Coca-Cola bottle and the football clothing make this scene highly familiar to the viewer. Footballers I is one of the works for which Ophuis is mostly known. Other works are Sweet Violence (1996), Birkenau I (2002), Birkenau II (2003), Execution (1995) Those paintings are representing sexual violence or are loaded with sexual tension. Other paintings showing scenes of perpetrating violence can be understood as part of war situations. For example, the Srebrenica series (2004‚Äì2008). A second difference is that many of Ophuis‚Äô works focus predominantly on the perpetrator while in biblical scenes the central figures are victims of violence. In these scenes the viewer can identify with the victim. The scenes are part of a narrative in which the role of the perpetrator and the victim are fixed. The suffering victim is without guilt and therefore posits his viewers also without guilt. In Ophuis‚Äô works the viewers attention is mainly directed to the perpetrators. One is encouraged to imagine oneself in a situation or position one does not want to be in. Also it is not clear whether the paintings celebrate or condemn the violence in the scene. The viewer cannot identify and is first to consider his own moral position. Historical and contemporary examples Ophuis‚Äô paintings can be related to the tradition of history painting in which he follows the Realistic mode. His works shows similarities with works by realistic history painters such as Manet. Like in Manet's painting The Execution of Emperor Maximilian (1867) the Ophuis‚Äô paintings show a single moment in a most neutral way. Not the victim but the perpetrator is in the centre of the scene. Also there are no clues of a pre- history, or of a closure. There is no dramatic lightning that suggests an unfolding of time. In short there are no metaphysical and moral dimensions which are so predominant in a biblical scene. His large works from the last few years demonstrate how he has primarily looked to the nineteenth century for references; to the likes of Goya, G√©ricault, Delacroix, Courbet and Manet (a tradition continued in our century by Picasso, Golub and Richter, with Jeff Wall as the contemporary exponent). In present time Ophuis‚Äô paintings can be compared to David Fincher‚Äôs film Fight Club (1999). Just like the paintings the film gives no answer whether it condemns or celebrates the violence it shows. The film and the paintings get therefore the same critique. The viewer expects a representation to be a sequence of events, or a source of information. In relation to the majority of mass media representations, Ophuis is as exceptional as Fincher. Ophuis is not performing a representational practice in which the viewer is directed in how to process or digest the representation, especially when it concerns issues of violence. Ophuis does not give a direction in his paintings and the viewer is compelled to make his own moral judgement. Usually Ophuis first does stage the scenes with actors and takes pictures of the enacted scenes. Ultimately he transforms the photographs into pictures. Ophuis uses a technique of covering the canvas with paint and after a process of scraping away and building up paint, leaves underlying layers filtering through the upper surface. Ophuis usually presents the violence in a highly direct and confrontational manner.

The site consisted of a low platform mound and an associated village. The majority of the mound was excavated, while the village received little excavation. Sixtoe Field Excavation in Sixtoe Field began in 1962. Excavation covered about , with test pits yielding the existence of a workshop site (9MU100; XU-G).

The site is not a source site of quartz; rather the quartz came from the streambed of the Coosawattee River. A village site was also discovered, as testing with a light steel probe uncovered a \\"hardpan\\", a tough compacted span of soil that is indicative of a floor of a housing structure. Excavation focused on two housing structures, Structure #1 and Structure #2. Structure #1 was most likely a house that was by with rounded corners. There was an entrance on the south side with a central hearth in the middle of the structure. No wall daub was found; rather the walls were most likely made with saplings with upper tapering portions bent and tied in the roof section, with cane mat- ting tied to a supporting framework of small splints inter- woven in the wall fabric. Structure #2 was very similar to Structure #1, but with some variations in post mould patterns. These structures also shared the relative same presence of artifacts and midden on the floor surface. The majority of the sherds found in Structure #1 and Structure #2 were of those were Dallas Plain. The \\"trash pits\\" of the village were able to illustrate what these people were eating. A main component of these middens were animal bones, particularly deer bones. Other small mammal bones along with fish bones and turtle carapaces were found as well. Apart from animal remains, numerous deposits of charred acorns and hickory nuts were found in pockets. What is noted here is that these people lived nearly on a completely traditional diet, with a notable absence of charred corncobs and kernels, which are found in other sites dating to this time period. Sixtoe Mound The majority of the excavation was conducted on the Sixtoe Mound. Sixtoe Mound was apparently a low, extensive platform mound of solid clay or gumbo construction, perhaps originally about above the surrounding terrain and original river levee. This is especially important in that when the Coosawattee River would flood, the mound would become an island until the water receded. The Sixtoe Mound contained various zones of construction. Zone A was a sub-mound soil complex of dark clay with much silt, where the original land surface was uneven and a natural levee on the north bank of the Coosawattee. Zone B was the initial mound-fill that was composed of a dark, almost black clay, with heavy organic content, charcoal, and some scattered midden inclusions. This zone varied in thickness from - and formed the core mound of the structure. Zone C was a small lamination of water-laid yellow- brown sand, ranging from - thick. Zone D consisted of basket-loaded clay, while Zone E was the complex superficies of Sixtoe Mound. The features of initial interest in this mound were the stone boulders, which varied from 2-75 pounds. These boulders formed a continuous mantle along the east escarpment of the mound. This wall was - wide and most likely served as a major factor in stabilizing erosion down slope. The Sixtoe Mound was located over from the village site and most likely served as a ceremonial center, which had large dormitory-like structures, two of which were by , on the mound summit. These structures were not burned down, but were rather built over, or one building would fall apart and a new one was then built over the remains. Unlike the village, midden accumulation in these structures was relatively scarce. Midden was most likely thrown into quarry pits made during construction of the mound and contained little animal bones, ash, or charcoal, which also differed from the village site. Pottery sherds were also found and ¬æ of the pottery was limestone tempered plain and complicated stamped, and this lack of shell tempered or sand tempered pottery as found in other sites in the area is somewhat of an anomaly. A number of non-ceramic artifacts were found, which include shell hoes, bone awls, a rough chipped stone spade, projectile points, flint knives, and a pair of ground stone \\"napkin ring\\" ear spools.

Discovery Kirktonecta is known from the holotype specimen UMZC 2002, a and b, an almost complete skeleton including the skull, and preserved evidence for soft tissues, in part (slab a) and counterpart (slab b). The holotype was collected in the East Kirkton Quarry, near Bathgate of West Lothian, from \\"Bed 82\\" East Kirkton Limestone of the Bathgate Hills Volcanic Formation, dating to the Brigantian substage, of the late Vis√©an stage, of the Dinantian series (Early Carboniferous), about 333-328.3 million years ago. It represents the first microsaur to be discovered in the United Kingdom and the earliest occurrence of a microsaur in the fossil record. The next oldest being Utaherpeton and an unnamed taxon from the Chesterian of Goreville, Illinois. Description Kirktonecta is diagnosed by the following autapomorphies: \\"deep tail, long, posteriorly directed, round-ended haemal spines in contact along their anterior and posterior margins distally, combined with low rounded neural spines; large pes, with tarsus breadth equivalent to the length of 3.5 or 4 presacral vertebrae.\\" Jennifer A. Clack, who named this genus, found it to be most closely related to basal microsaurs, such as Asaphestera, Saxonerpeton, Hyloplesion and Llistrofus. Etymology Kirktonecta was first named by Jennifer A. Clack in 2011 and the type species is Kirktonecta milnerae. The generic name is derived from the name of the East Kirkton Quarry, where the holotype was found, and Greek necta, \\"swimmer\\". The specific name honours the paleontologist Angela C. Milner.

Supporting actors include Eric Wareheim (Tim and Eric), James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem), and Gregg Turkington (better known as Neil Hamburger). The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and screened within such festivals as Maryland Film Festival 2012. The film was distributed by Tribeca Film and was slated for theatrical release on November 9, 2012 and nationwide on demand starting October 24, 2012. Despite the title and use of comedians as actors, Sundance festival chief programmer Trevor Groth says that the film is not a comedy, but instead \\"a provocation, a critique of a culture based at its core around irony and sarcasm and about ultimately how hollow that is.\\" The film was deliberately leaked onto various torrent websites, though the file only shows the first ten minutes before abruptly cutting to Heidecker sitting silently on a boat behind a scrolling anti-piracy statement.  Plot  Swanson (Heidecker) is an aging, upper class hipster who alternately feels apathy and resentment towards his surroundings. He lives on a boat and spends his time partying and wandering around Brooklyn with his equally privileged friends, humorlessly ridiculing the various people they encounter. In the beginning of the film, his father is comatose, and Swanson is set to inherit his estate. He mentions having a brother who is institutionalized, though it is unclear where. The only familial connection he has appears to be his sister-in-law (Liza Kate). The film has no clear narrative, instead showing vignettes of Swanson's offensive behavior as he improvises situations to make strangers and acquaintances uncomfortable. Swanson and his buddies (Eric Wareheim, James Murphy, Richard Swift) continuously mock their less intelligent friend Cargill (Jeff Jensen) after he confesses they are important to him. Cargill continues spending time with them regardless. Swanson flirts with a woman at a party while sarcastically praising Hitler. She's sleeping naked in Swanson's boat the next morning, and he solemnly ferries her back to land. Swanson and his friends visit a church, where they desecrate various objects and cause a scene. Swanson visits a bar in Harlem alone, flaunting his wealth and insulting the African-American patrons by suggesting he gentrify the place. At one point, Swanson pays a cab driver 400 dollars to let him drive the car, only to speed recklessly and harass a woman on the street. Growing bored, Swanson finds part-time work as a dishwasher. His ironic sense of humor attracts the attention of a waitress (Kate Lyn Sheil), who he later takes onto his boat. As Swanson awkwardly fails to make a move, the woman suffers a seizure. Rather than help, he watches her with vague interest. One night, Swanson's friend Van (Wareheim) shows their group a slideshow of photos from his childhood, interspersing vintage pornographic images as a gag. Despite some initial laughs, the group eventually falls silent and everyone appears saddened. In the final sequence, Swanson visits the beach, where he plays in the water with a young child, an activity he seems to genuinely enjoy.  Reception  The film received mixed reviews from critics. It received an aggregate rating of 47% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews, and 46% on Metacritic based on the opinions of 15 critics (indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\"). For example, David Lewis of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film was \\"one of the most self-indulgent, pretentious and unfunny movies of the year\\", while Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film an \\"A‚àí\\" rating, writing that \\"few films have better articulated the limits of irony as a force field against the world\\". At the 2012 Philadelphia Film Festival, Heidecker was awarded the festival's \\"Best Actor\\" prize. The film had a limited theatrical release, grossing $41,113 in four theaters over eight weeks.

It is a colourful festival that features brass band music. History Dutch and British traders at the Winneba seaport began the tradition of the festival in the 19th century. Wearing assorted masks, they danced and drank in white-owned bars celebrating Christmas. Janka Abraham, who hailed from Saltpond, also in the Central Region, and worked as a bar attendant at one of these bars, thought of incorporating the masquerade tradition and festival into local custom. He founded the troop known as Nobles with his friend, pharmacist A. K. Yamoah, in the Alata Kokwado neighborhood around 1923 or 1924. People who belonged to A. K. Yamoah's football club and indoor games groups joined. Membership required the ability to speak the English language. Early days The members of the Nobles would gather before dawn on Christmas Day, dressed up in costumes, such as garb of doctors, nurses, teachers, ministers, pastors, farmers, fishermen, prostitutes, pastors, drivers, cowboys, sailors, angels, or even the white colonial masters. The idea was to imitate the various town professions and parody the Europeans. The troop would then parade through the streets of Winneba, backed by adaha music, and would continue all day into the evening. Name change The name \\"Fancy Dress\\" was used because the Egyaa group, which was made up of fishermen who spoke no English, had a hard time pronouncing the word ‚Äúmasquerade.‚Äù Instead, they used the term ‚ÄúFancy Dress,‚Äù which they pronounced ‚Äúfanti dress.‚Äù Growth of groups After some years, membership in the Nobles was opened to all residents of Winneba. This led to an increase in membership. Based on the activities of the Nobles, in 1926 the paramount chief of Winneba, Nana Kow Sackey (Ayirebi Acquah III), and his friends formed Egyaa, a second group, at Aboadze, a fishing community. The town folks referred to the Nobles as ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù and Egyaa as ‚ÄúNumber Two‚Äù. Formation of Number Three In 1930, members of the Gyateh royal family, who did not approve of Kow Sackey‚Äôs support for the Egyaa group, formed another group in the Gyateh area of Donkoyemu. Called Tumbo rusu (pronounced tumus)‚Äîwhich translates as the sound of the blacksmith‚Äôs anvil‚Äîthe group was led by Gyateh family members Arkoful, a blacksmith, Kweku Akom, and Inkabi. It drew its membership from Catholic youths with little education from local fishing communities, and members of the nearby Winneba Catholic Church. The European priests paid for new costumes each year and for European masks, funding the group so well that it became the most highly esteemed Fancy Dress Company. One of the group's members was enamored of the character of Robin Hood, but accidentally shot the nephew of a priest in the eye with a stray arrow on Christmas Day in 1930. The tragic mishap led the groups to ban portrayal of that character in the Fancy Dress celebrations by anyone over the age of seven. Formation of Number Four One of A. K. Yamoah‚Äôs brothers, A. W. Yamoah, moved to Abasraba, a suburb of Winneba, in 1933. A merchant by trade, he imported masks and brass instruments and founded a Fancy Dress group called Red Cross or Number Four. This group was composed mainly of the town elite, including high school and college youth; prospective members had to pass entrance exams on English language and Ghanaian cultural studies. Adult members of means paid monthly dues, which funded the importing of costumes and Halloween masks from abroad at year's end. Children below eight years of age and poor families did not pay, although they had to accept the attire that paying members chose for them. Brass band music In its early years, the music for all groups in the festival was traditional adaha music. Brass band music had been introduced to the region in 1880s by European missionaries and military groups. In 1934, Catholic priests introduced brass band music to the festival by bringing in a band that had received training from Presbyterian missionaries in the nearby town of Swedru Bibiani. The band was not skilled and it knew only one song (\\"Abaawa Begye Wo Letter Kema Woewuraba\\"; in English \\"Maidservant, This is a Letter for Your Madam\\"), which it played throughout the day. In reaction to the annoyance of hearing one song played continuously, A. W. Yamoah arranged to provide training in brass instruments for some of his family members. The resulting new band was more skilled than the one from Swedru Bibiani. The Nobles group also formed a brass band. However, because most members of these bands preferred masquerading over playing in a band, for festival days bands typically are recruited from outside the local groups. Structure All groups have a common hierarchy: in charge is the group father, previously often a noble but now most likely to be a well-educated male, who manages the finances and venues as well as the welfare of members in general. Under him are the band leader, who organises rehearsals and teaches the music, the Fancy Dress leader, who looks after choreography and interviews potential new members, and the group mother, who looks after food and settles disputes. She is also treated as a biological mother by group members. Cowboys are fit and strong members who are answerable to the Fancy Dress leader and look after general members. Then there are scouts, stilt walkers, and general members under the cowboys‚Äô control. Scouts move ahead and solicit money from onlookers for the group.

Personal life On 28 August 1843, she was married to William II, who was 43 years her senior, in Wilhelmsbad (now part of Hanau). She was his third wife, following the death of his first wife, Princess Augusta of Prussia (the fourth daughter of King Frederick William II of Prussia) in 1841, and his second wife, Countess Emilie of Reichenbach-Lessonitz in 1843. This was a morganatic marriage, because she was considered lesser nobility and therefore not befitting for a sovereign Elector. The couple's main residence was Frankfurt, since the elector had in 1830 and virtually abdicated the government to his son, Frederick William I, from his first, non-morganatic, marriage. In 1844, the Elector elevated Caroline to the \\"Baroness of Bergen\\" and in 1846, she received the Austrian title of \\"Countess of Bergen\\".

Range and habitat This species is distributed in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico along the eastern coasts of North America from Maine to Yucat√°n. It does not occur in the West Indies. It is well known in the Chesapeake Bay, where it is the most abundant fish.Anchoa mitchilli. Field Guide. Chesapeake Bay Program. It occurs in a wide range of water temperatures and salinities, including some hypersaline environments. It does not tolerate low-oxygen waters and easily asphyxiates when deprived of oxygen. This fish spends most of its time cruising the water column. It can also be found over bare substrates at the ocean floor and in tide pools and surf zones. It can live in muddy, brackish waters. It rarely enters waters deeper than 25 meters. Biology and ecology This fish feeds on zooplankton, including copepods, mysids, and crab larvae. It is in turn an important prey item for a variety of larger fish, including weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), chain pickerel (Esox niger), and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). Birds such as royal terns (Thalasseus maximus) and Sandwich terns (T. sandvicensis) feed on it. This species is an important link in the food web in many ecosystems. It is a major pathway by which zooplankton biomass is converted to the biomass of larger fish. The bay anchovy is sexually mature when it reaches about 4 centimeters in length. It spawns in the water column in shallow and deeper waters. In the southern part of its range it spawns year-round, and farther north it breeds during the warmer months. A female can spawn 50 times in one season, producing over 1000 eggs each time. Eggs hatch in 24 hours. Larvae mature in about 45 days. Their growth rates are variable and may depend on the availability of food. Human uses This species is made into anchovy paste and is used as a bait fish. It is harvested as a rough fish and used for fish oil and fish paste. Conservation This fish is not of conservation concern. It has an extensive range, a large and stable population made up of many subpopulations, and no major threats. References Further reading *Jung, S. and E. D. Houde. 2004.

This group includes Americans of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Persons from North Africa have been in the United States since the sixteenth century. Some of the early explorers who accompanied the Spanish on their expeditions in the United States were North Africans, a group that also contributed to the settlement of some Spanish colonies of that country. Currently, the North African population in the United States exceeds 800,000 people. Its largest populations are found in the eastern United States.Egyptian Americans by Mona Mikhail North Africans in the U.S. can be of Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, and Egyptian origin. Sometimes Canarians are also included in this group, because of the geographical location of the Canary Islands in North Africa, and the partly North African ancestry of their population (the Canarians are generally of predominant European ancestry with some Berber extract) are also considered North Africans (although politically are Europeans, and linguistically, being Spanish, Hispanics). Although according to the 2000 census there were 3,217 North Africans in the country, the number of people who indicated some North African specific origin exceeded with many this figure (the Moroccan American, per example were more of 37.000 people in the same census). As of 2008, there were over 800,000 North Africans in the United States hailing from North Africa's the various native ethnics groups. History The first centuries of a North African presence in the U.S. is related to the Spanish colonial period in the Southern part of the present-day United States. Moroccan presence in the United States was rare until the mid-twentieth century. The first North Africa who came to the current United States was probably the Azemmouri or Estevanico¬¥s slave, a Muslim Moroccan pilot boat of Berber origin, who participated in the P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez's ill-fated expedition to colonize Florida and the Gulf Coast in 1527. Only Azemmouri and three of his comrades survived during the eleven- year- long of journey, of 5,000 mile, from Florida to the West Coast, ending the tour in Texas.Se confirma la presencia de musulmanes hispanos en la Am√©rica precolombina (in Spanish: It confirms the presence of Hispanic Muslims in pre-Columbian America) So, in 1534, them crossed the southern from United States until Arizona, being also, more later, one of four men who accompanied Marcos de Niza as a guide in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola, preceding Coronado.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez, Fernando; Canales, Carlos (2009).

EDAF. He was also the first explorer who entered an Indian village. Later, in 1566, forty years before Jamestown, the Spanish founded the colony of Santa Elena, la Florida. The colony grew for over twenty years until it was invaded by the British in 1587. Many of the Santa Elena colonists were Moriscos and Jews. Ethnically, many of the Santa Elena colonists were Muslims of Berber origin and Sephardic Jews, recruited by the Portuguese Captain Joao Pardo in the thick Galician mountains of northern Portugal in 1567, i.e. less than a year before the climax of the Inquisition against Muslims. When Santa Elena fell, its inhabitants-including the converted Jews and Muslims-escaped into the mountains of North Carolina. And there survived, often marrying Native American, and then joining a second group that came to American shores, ironically in 1587, the same year that Santa Elena fell. However, until the second half of the 20th century, most of the North African people who emigrated to the United States came, actually, from the Canary Islands, that politically belong to Spain. They came to some the Spanish colonies of South from United States with the objective to found and repopulate regions for Spain. In 1539, Hernando de Soto recruited some expeditionaries in this archipelago to explore La Florida, and in 1569 embarked another group of Canarian farmers (known in the Americas as Isle√±os) with this destination. During the 18th century other groups of Canarian people arrived to the present United States, and became established in several zones of the South of this country. Thus, in 1731 arrived 16 Canarian families to San Antonio (Texas), between 1757 and 1780, arrived more of 984 Canarian families to Florida (that, although they promoted the agriculture of this state, the most of the settlers of Florida emigrated to Cuba when Florida was sold to the UK in 1763, well as when, after being recovered by Spain, was ceded to the United States in 1819) and between 1778 and 1783 emigrated more of 2,000 Canarians to Louisiana. Thus, more than 3,000 Canarians emigrated to the Spanish colonies in North America during the 18th century.Hern√°ndez Gonz√°lez, Manuel.

First Edition January 2007 However they are Spanish politically. A small community of Moroccan expatriates existed in post- independence South Carolina (then referred to as \\"Moors\\", cf. the Moors Sundry Act of 1790). The continental North Africans have emigrated to United States in significant numbers only since the 1960s. Most have been Egyptian (who fled after the rise of Nasser and the resulting change of government). Until this time, very few continental North Africans arrived to United States, numbering less than 100 people in the first half of the 19th century. Many of the North African emigrants during the first half of the 20th century were Jews.Evertculture:Morocco American. Posted by Elizabeth Shostak Many Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians began to arrive significantly in the 1970s. Sudanese did not start arriving in significant numbers until the 1980s, mostly to escape the civil war in their country.Health and Health-Related Factors of Sudanese Most North Africans emigrate due to economic, religious, educational, or political reasons. Demography North Africans in the United States include Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, Mauritanian, Egyptian and Sudanese immigrants to the United States. The largest such communities live in New Jersey, New York, California, Washington DC and Texas. In California, most North Africans live in around from Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. In Texas, the communities are, mainly, in Dallas, Austin and Houston. There are also important North African settlements in Michigan (mainly in Detroit), Nebraska (Omaha), Florida (in cities such as Miami, Orlando or Jacksonville), Illinois (Chicago) and Virginia (in cities such as Alexandria). Also there Isle√±o communities in Texas, Louisiana and in Florida. While in the first two states, most of the Isle√±os are descended from Canarian settlers; in the third are recent immigrants and their descendants. The ancestries of North Africans in the United States are the next: * Egyptian Americans: 256,070 (2016 census. * Moroccan Americans: 29,461 (2016 Census) * Canarian Americans: 45,000 - 75,000 (2000 statistics) * Libyan Americans: 9,000 (2010 Census) * Algerian Americans: 8,752 (2000 Census) * Tunisian Americans: 4,735 (2000 Census)  Genetics  Most of these populations belong to the E1b1b paternal haplogroup, with Berber speakers having among the highest frequencies of this lineage. Additionally, genomic analysis has found that Berber and other Maghreb communities are defined by a shared ancestral component. This Maghrebi element peaks among Tunisian Berbers. It is related to the Coptic/Ethio-Somali, having diverged from these and other West Eurasian-affiliated components prior to the Holocene people with origins from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. Culture and language Most of North Africans in the United States are Coptic Orthodox Christians (of Egyptian origin), Muslims, Jews and Catholics (Isle√±os). Although there is also a small minority of people with the Berber culture that according to the census of 2000, they were a 1327 people in the U.S. As well as also Jewish minorities originating mainly from Morocco and Egypt. Most of the Muslim are Sunnis. Linguistically, the majority of North Africans in United States speak English, Arabic, Coptic, French (Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians and Mauritanians), Berber, Italian (Libyans) and Spanish (some Isle√±os). While the Arabic language is shared by most North African people ‚Äì although in their particular dialects such as Moroccan Arabic or Tunisian Arabic-, French and Italian are also often used among North Africans from the states that were colonies of France and Italy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Berber also is spoken mainly by many Moroccans (in fact, in Morocco, the people who speak Berber is, according various estimates, between 45% and 60% of the population) and Algerians (in Algeria represent between the 25% and the 45% of population) in United States. The majority of the Isle√±os speak English, but there still some people who speak a Canarian Spanish of the 18th century. The more recent Canarian immigrants; as they are Spanish, they speak Spanish. Organizations Although some organizations created by North Africans in the United States are directed to the Muslim community general (as Association of American Muslims, created by Egyptian groups), there also associations directed specifically to the North African community of United States. This is the case of the Maghreb Association of North America (MANA), an organization created by Moroccan and Algerian Americans in Chicago and that have as goal help new immigrants from North Africa to adapt to American life and maintain, also the basic principles that consists of Islam, particularly the basic principles of the Sunni branch. This organization is particularly directed to North African immigrants because they have not been associated closely with the Muslim people of Middle East. Another important organization is The Amazigh Cultural Association in America (ACAA), a non-profit organization established in the New Jersey state. This organization's goal is to promote the Amazigh (Berber) language and culture in the United States. The United Amazigh Algerian (UAAA), a nonreligious association based in the San Francisco bay area, also have like goal boost the Berber culture in North America and beyond.United Amazigh Algerian Other Amazigh organization is the Amazigh American Association of Washington, DC. However, many organizations are also directed to specific groups as are the Egyptian American Businessmen's Association (in the Greenwich city, Connecticut), Algerian American Association of Houston, Egyptian American Physicians' Association, Egyptian American Professionals' Society (in Westchester County, New York), Friends of Morocco, Algerian American Association of Northern California, the New Sudan-American Hope (NSAH, founded in 1999 by a group of Sudanese from Rochester, Minnesota, to help Sudanese refugees in aspect such as language and skill),New Sudan American Hope .

His brother, Fritz Knothe also played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman. Knothe was known as a sure-handed defensive player. Baseball career Knothe was born in Bayonne, New Jersey and graduated from high school in 1917. He began his professional baseball career in 1922 at the age of 24 with the Newark Bears of the International League. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1925. In 1926, he posted a .354 batting average with the Lawrence Merry Macks of the New England League. In 1928, he had a career year with the Pueblo Steel Workers of the Western League when, he hit .318 in 164 games with 41 doubles, 17 triples, and six home runs. His impressive performance earned him a job with the Kansas City Blues of the American Association. His strong defensive play helped the Blues win the 1929 Little World Series over the Rochester Red Wings. In 1931, the Blues sent Knothe to the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association where, he became known as one of the best defensive shortstops in the league. The Philadelphia Phillies selected Knothe in the Rule 5 draft on September 30, 1931. He made his major league debut with the Phillies at the relatively late age of 34 on April 25, 1932 in a game against the Boston Red Sox that, also featured his brother Fritz playing as the Red Sox third baseman. Four days later at Philadelphia‚Äôs Baker Bowl, he collected his only major-league hit, a double off of Brooklyn pitcher Van Lingle Mungo. The presence of veteran player Dick Bartell relegated Knothe to the role of utility player. After only one month in the major leagues, a new Depression-era rule limiting teams to 23 players would lead the Phillies to send him to the Fort Worth Cats of the Class A Texas League. Knothe returned to play for the New Orleans Pelicans in 1933, helping the team win the Dixie Series against the Texas League‚Äôs San Antonio Missions. He played his final season in organized baseball with the Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association. Knothe continued to play baseball for semi-pro teams until the age of 39. Career statistics In a twelve-year minor league career, Knothe played in 1,131 games, accumulating 1,165 hits in 4,196 at bats for a .277 career batting average, along with 23 home runs. He appeared in 6 major league games, getting 1 hit in 12 at bats and scored 2 runs.

Water for Food, Water for Life, A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. London: Earthscan, and Colombo: International Water Management Institute was published in 2007 by International Water Management Institute and Earthscan in an attempt to answer the question: how can water in agriculture be developed and managed to help end poverty and hunger, ensure environmentally sustainable practices, and find the right balance between food and environmental security? History Compiled after consultation with more than 700 individuals, numerous organisations and networks, it was the first critical evaluation of: * the benefits, costs and impacts of the past 50 years of water development * water management challenges facing communities today * successful methods of managing water in farming around the world. The assessment confirmed that agriculture consumes more water resources than any other sector.Map details global water stress, BBC, 21 August 2006 A key finding was that a third of the world's population live in water-scarce areas. More than 1.2 billion live in areas of physical water scarcity, lacking water resources. Parts of Australia and the United States suffer in this way. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas of economic water scarcity, where there is insufficient human capacity or financial resources for people to effectively make use of water that is available. Here, sub-Saharan Africa is a good example; there is water in the rivers but no dams or pumps to enable people to use it.World water demand surging due to rising population, Alister Doyle, Reuters, 18 September 2006 Trends affecting demands for water The report's authors forecast that the need for water would double within 50 years, due to global population rise, more people choosing to eat a diet of meat and vegetables rather than primarily consuming cereals, and climate change.Need for Water Could Double in 50 Years, U.N. Study Finds, New York Times, August 22, 2006 Generally, about one litre of liquid water gets converted to water vapour to produce one calorie of food. We each consume between 2,000 and 5,000 liters of water every day, depending on our diet and how the food is produced. This is far more than the two to five litres we drink every day. A heavy meat diet requires much more than a vegetarian diet, because water is used to grow food for the animals as well as being used directly to support the livestock. Economic growth fuels changes in diets; for example, per capita meat demand in China has quadrupled over the last 30 years, and milk and egg products are becoming increasingly popular in India. Growing cities, expanding industry and biofuels are increasingly competing for water with an expanding agriculture. How feeding the future world will be possible Irrigation water management in a maize field The conclusion made by the report's authors was that only by changing the way we use water within agriculture would we be able to meet the acute water, environment and poverty challenges facing us over the next 50 years. They suggested that with wise policies and investments in irrigation, upgrading rainfed agriculture, and trade it would be possible to limit future growth in water withdrawals to 13% and the expansion of cultivated land to 9%. However, the effects of climate change and the increased use of biofuels would complicate matters, making actions necessary to address these. The Assessment found the greatest potential lay in rainfed areas of the world housing the highest number of poor people. Upgrading these rainfed lands through better water management held the greatest potential to increase productivity and decrease poverty.Water Management: Urgent Need For More Food With Less Water, Science Daily, March 27, 2007. The technology would not necessarily need to be complex; simple measures such as catching water in huge tubular plastic bags and storing roof and road run-off could double or even triple food production in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia, effectively increasing productivity from each raindrop by that amount.Andy Coughlan, Catch every drop to fight world hunger, New Scientist, August 26, 2006 Shaping future water policy The report recommended eight policy actions: * Change the way we think about water and agriculture. Rain should be viewed as the ultimate source of water to be managed, and agriculture as part of an agro-ecosystem that provides food but also delivers other environmental services, such as maintaining soil fertility. * Fight poverty by improving access to agricultural water and its use. This would be achieved by promoting livelihood gains by smallholder farmers, for example by securing water access through rights and developing multiple-use water supply systems. * Manage agriculture to enhance ecosystem services. This would involve using good agricultural practices to enhance other ecosystem services. * Increase the productivity of water. The outcome would be higher yields and value from smaller volumes of water, thus reducing demand and environmental impacts. * Upgrade rainfed agriculture by improving soil moisture and using supplemental irrigation. This holds the greatest potential for lifting people out of poverty and increasing water productivity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. * Adapt yesterday's irrigation for tomorrow's needs. Modernisation would require a mix of technological and management upgrades. * Reform the reform process, targeting state institutions. Water managements investments should embrace irrigated and rainfed agriculture, plus fisheries and livestock practices. * Deal with trade-offs and make difficult choices. Informed multi-stakeholder negotiations would be essential.

He left Lancashire at the end of the 1988 season and proceeded to join Surrey for the 1989 season, making his debut for the county against Gloucestershire in the Refuge Assurance League. His first-class debut for Surrey came shortly after against Warwickshire in the County Championship.

The expression uses the word \\"done\\" in the sense of \\"finished\\" or \\"settled\\", a usage which dates back to the first half of the 15th century. Meaning It usually means something along the line of: the consequence of a situation (which was once within your control), is now out of your control, that is, \\"there's no changing the past, so learn from it and move on.\\" Etymology One of the first-recorded uses of this phrase was by the character Lady Macbeth in Act 3, Scene 2 of the tragedy play Macbeth (early 17th century), by the English playwright William Shakespeare, who said: \\"Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what's done, is done\\" and \\"Give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone.To bed, to bed, to bed!\\" Shakespeare did not coin the phrase; it is actually a derivative of the early 14th-century French proverb: , which is translated into English as \\"But when a thing is already done, it cannot be undone\\".

It is a perennial, deciduous plant that blooms in mid to early June.ITIS report: Anemone richardsonii Hook Description Yellow thimbleweed is recognized by its small single yellow flowers. These flowers are considered perfect, which means they have both male and female reproductive organs. The flower lacks petals but has yellow sepals that act as petals and it has a superior ovary. The flower sits on a stem that can grow about high, and is pubescent (covered with tiny hairs). Anemonastrum richardsonii has rhizomes (underground stems) which are thread-like with stalked leaves that are palmately lobed. It also has stem leaves that are 3-parted and sharply toothed in a whorled arrangement below the flowers. The flower develops into an achene (a dry fruit), which is generally small, long. It is sub-spherical (nearly round), lacks hairs, and is hooked at the tip. The fruit of the yellow thimbleweed is dispersed by wind and has a style that aids in flight. Habitat Anemonastrum richardsonii prefers subarctic climates and can be found in willow thickets, snow patches, along streams, near peat and mosses, and in moist areas with low drainage. It is capable of growing under a wide range of soil pH. Range Yellow thimbleweed can be found throughout most of Canada, including the Northwest Territories, Yukon, northern Quebec, Labrador, the Nunavut Islands, Melville Island, and Victoria Island Canada, as well as in west Greenland and Alaska (U.S.A.). Importance to ecosystems A. richardsonii's flowers produce much pollen, which attracts some insect pollinators, but they do not produce much nectar; the plant is not generally eaten by vertebrates. Uses Herbalists use the plant to soothe abrasions, toothaches, rheumatism, and depression. Traditionally, the roots were boiled and used in an attempt to treat paralysis, though this was ineffective. The smoke from the cotton of the ripe seeds was also burned and inhaled to relieve headaches. A. richardsonii contains anemonin and protoanemonin, bioactive compounds which have been investigated for potential therapeutic uses; one indication is that anemonin may inhibit pigmentation synthesis. Conservation In British Columbia, A. richardsonii is abundant, secure and widespread; this seems to reflect the status of the species throughout North America, as it is not listed in any vulnerable categories by COSEWIC in Canada or by the United States Department of Agriculture.

The notion \\"that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries\\", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.

These barnacles are found, often in large numbers, attached by their flexible stalks to floating timber, the hulls of ships, piers, pilings, seaweed and various sorts of flotsam. Description Barnacles dangling from a piece of timber, from the Natural History Museum, London The body or capitulum of Lepas anatifera is supported by a long, flexible stalk or peduncle. There are five smooth, translucent plates, edged with scarlet and separated by narrow gaps. The plates have growth lines parallel with their margins and a few faint radial sculpture lines. Inside the capitulum, the barnacle has a head and thorax and vestigial abdomen. A number of brown, filamentous cirri or feeding tentacles project from between the plates. The peduncle is tough and a purplish-brown colour. The capitulum can grow to a length of and the peduncle varies between and .Lepas anatifera Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-12-02. Distribution Lepas anatifera has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. Because it is often attached to objects carried into colder seas by currents, such as the North Atlantic Drift, it is often found well away from its place of origin and in waters too cold for it to reproduce. In this way it has been recorded from Norway, the Shetland Islands, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland and Spitsbergen. Biology Lepas anatifera is a hermaphrodite and starts to breed when it is about 2.5 centimetres (1 in) long. Fertilisation is internal and the eggs are brooded inside the mantle for a week before emerging as free swimming nauplius larvae. After further development, drifting as part of the plankton, these settle onto floating objects.Lepas anatifera Linnaeus, 1758 WallaWalla. Retrieved 2011-12-02. Lepas anatifera has long been known to grow on sea turtles, but in 2008, some small specimens were found attached to an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) on the Pacific coast of Mexico. This crocodile species mostly inhabits mangrove swamps and river estuaries but it is salt tolerant, and is sometimes found in marine environments. In this instance, the size of the goose-neck barnacles indicated that the crocodile must have been in the sea for at least a week. This is the first time that Lepas anatifera has been recorded as an epibiont of a crocodilian. Origin of the name In 13th-century England the word \\"barnacle\\" was used for a species of waterfowl, the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). This bird breeds in the Arctic but winters in the British Isles so its nests and eggs were never seen by the British. It was thought at the time that the gooseneck barnacles that wash up occasionally on the shore had spontaneously generated from the rotting wood to which they were attached, and that the geese might be generated similarly. Credence to the idea was provided by the tuft of brown cirri that protruded from the capitulum of the crustaceans which resembled the down of an unhatched gosling. Popular belief linked the two species and a writer in 1678 wrote \\"multitudes of little Shells; having within them little Birds perfectly shap'd, supposed to be Barnacles [by which he meant barnacle geese].\\"Barnacle American Heritage Dictionary.

A ruana (possibly from Spanish ruana \\"ragged\\" or Quechua ruana \\"textile\\") is a poncho-style outer garment native to the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes. In Colombia, the ruana is the characteristic and traditional garment of the department of Boyac√°, initially made by indigenous and mestizo people, although it is also made in the departments of Cundinamarca, Antioquia, Nari√±o, Bogot√°, Santander (Colombia), Norte de Santander and Caldas. In Venezuela it is widely used and made in the Andean states of T√°chira, M√©rida and Trujillo, used since the colonial times by all Venezuelan inhabitants, currently only in the Andean region its traditional use is maintained. Similar to other poncho-like garments in Latin America, a ruana is basically a very thick, soft and sleeveless square or rectangular blanket with an opening in the center for the head to go through with a slit down the front to the hem. A ruana may or may not come with a hood to cover the head.  Etymology and origin  The word ruana is of unknown origin but likely comes from the Spanish language \\"ruana\\" meaning woollen cloth, ragged, or street-related. However, albeit dubious, according to ProColombia (former Proexport), the official Colombian agency in charge of international tourism, foreign investment, and non-traditional exports, the word ruana comes from the Chibcha ruana meaning \\"Land of Blankets\\", used to refer to the woollen fabrics manufactured by the Muisca and timoto-cuicas natives.Proexport. 'Retrieved December 2, 2011' The ruanas worn by the native Muisca (Chibcha) were apparently made of wool and knee-long, well-suited to the cold temperatures of the region where they were used not only as a piece of garment but also as a blanket for use in bed or to sit on as a cushion of sorts. Many ruanas are handcrafted with sheep's virgin wool. An 1856 watercolor shows an indigenous man in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia weaving a ruana using a large foot-pedaled loom. Nevertheless, the pre- Columbian local origin hypothesis of the ruana is widely unacknowledged among Colombian scholars, noting that although pre-Columbian Muisca (also known as Chibcha) peoples wore garments similar to the ruana, the modern ruana doesn't seem to have evolved from these nor it shows continuity from the regional pre- hispanic garments, rather the ruana appears to have been introduced after the Spanish conquest by the uprooted foreign Quechua yanakuna slave-servants belonging to the defunct Inca Empire who were brought by the local Spanish hacendados in order to work the lands during the early Colonial period.  Colombia  √°.  Boyac√° y Cundinamarca  In Colombia there are two festivals in honor of the ruana, both in municipalities of the department of Boyac√°: the World Day of Ruana, in Nobsa, and the National Festival of Ruana, Pa√±ol√≥n, Almoj√°bana and Amasijo, in Paipa. This unique garment is also a fundamental part of the idiosyncrasy of Boyacense popular music known as Carranga, music that was born in the rural areas of that department and is mainly accompanied by the Tiple, the Guitar and the Tiple Requinto (chordophone) of Colombia. Currently this genre has been renewed with more alternative groups such as the \\"Velo de Oza\\" and the \\"Rolling Ruanas\\".  Antioquia  In Antioquia, the ruana was part of the clothing worn by the peasants of this region, as also was the cabuya espadrilles, Aguade√±o hat, machete, Carriel, the cowhide and of course the ruana. The ruana is made of sheep's wool and has dark colors. Formerly it had as ornament large red and yellow stripes, but day by day the ruana has been made simpler. Over the days the black ruana became very common. Also the dark blue and the dark gray, almost black.  Caldas  In the department of Caldas, the ruana is derived both from the Antioque√±a ruana (poncho) and from the Boyacense ruana made of sheep's wool, thanks to the colonizations that people of these regions made at different times. The ruana is popular and in cold-weather towns such as Marulanda, Manzanares, Letras and in other paramo areas near Nevado del Ruiz.  Venezuela  XIX century, venezuelan hunters wearing ruanas or \\"cobijas\\" In Venezuela it is the typical attire of the Merida mountain range, becoming the characteristic clothing of the \\"gochos\\". In Venezuela, before the \\"Andean hegemony\\", the ruana or blanket was used by the entire population as a garment to protect themselves from the sun in the hot lands or as a garment to protect themselves from the cold in the highlands, as noted by Ram√≥n P√°ez in \\"Wild Scenes in South America; or life in the Venezuelan llanos\\" and Captain Vowels in \\"las sabanas de Barinas\\" XIX century, venezuelan llaneros wearing ruanas. In the Venezuelan Andes they were used without discrimination by all the population, which fascinated the German painter Ferdinand Bellermann. According to the information of the time, the ruana was composed of a single color, and in the Andes they were handcrafted from animal fabrics to protect themselves from the cold, while in the plains it was lighter to protect themselves from the heat. This garment has lost its daily use and now it is only wore culturally or in the upper regions of the Merida mountain range.

This is a complex process that must take into account the complex anatomy of the brain as well as the restrictions imposed by the special junctions of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Anatomy The blood‚Äìbrain barrier is formed by special tight junctions between endothelial cells lining brain blood vessels. Blood vessels of all tissues contain this monolayer of endothelial cells, however only brain endothelial cells have tight junctions preventing passive diffusion of most substances into the brain tissue.Neuroscience, Purves et al. Sinauer Associates, Inc. 2008. The structure of these tight junctions was first determined in the 1960s by Tom Reese, Morris Kranovsky and Milton Brightman. Furthermore, astrocytic \\"end feet\\", the terminal regions of the astrocytic processes, surround the outside of brain capillary endothelial cells\\". The astrocytes are glial cells restricted to the brain and spinal cord and help maintain blood-brain barrier properties in brain endothelial cells. Physiology The main function of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier is to protect the brain and keep it isolated from harmful toxins that are potentially in the blood stream. It accomplishes this because of its structure, as is usual in the body that structure defines its function. The tight junctions between the endothelial cells prevent large molecules as well as many ions from passing between the junction spaces. This forces molecules to go through the endothelial cells in order to enter the brain tissue, meaning that they must pass through the cell membranes of the endothelial cells.Rubin, L. L., & Staddon, J. M. (1999). The Cell Biology Of The Blood‚ÄìBrain Barrier. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 22(1), 11-28. Because of this, the only molecules that are easily able to transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier are ones that are very lipid-soluble. These are not the only molecules that can transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier; glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide are not lipid-soluble but are actively transported across the barrier, to support normal cellular function of the brain.Ramlakhan, N., & Altman, J. (1990). Breaching the Blood‚ÄìBrain Barrier. New Scientist, 128, 52-52. The fact that molecules have to fully transverse the endothelial cells makes them a perfect barricade to unspecified particles from entering the brain, working to protect the brain at all costs. Also, because most molecules are transported across the barrier, it does a very effective job of maintaining homeostasis for the most vital organ of the human body. Drug delivery to the blood‚Äìbrain barrier Because of the difficulty for drugs to pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, a study was conducted to determine the factors that influence a compound‚Äôs ability to transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. In this study, they examined several different factors to investigate diffusion across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. They used lipophilicity, Gibbs Adsorption Isotherm, a Co CMC Plot, and the surface area of the drug to water and air. They began by looking at compounds whose blood‚Äìbrain permeability was known and labeled them either CNS+ or CNS- for compounds that easily transverse the barrier and those that did not.Seelig, A., Gottschlich, R., & Devant, R. M. (1994). A Method to Determine the Ability of Drugs to Diffuse through the Blood- Brain Barrier. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 91(1), 68-72. They then set out to analyze the above factors to determine what is necessary to transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. What they found was a little surprising; lipophilicity is not the leading characteristic for a drug to pass through the barrier. This is surprising because one would think that the most effective way to make a drug move through a lipophilic barrier is to increase its lipophilicity, it turns out that it is a complex function of all of these characteristics that makes a drug able to pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The study found that barrier permittivity is \\"based on the measurement of the surface activity and as such takes into account the molecular properties of both hydrophobic and charged residues of the molecule of interest.\\" They found that there is not a simple answer to what compounds transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and what does not. Rather, it is based on the complex analysis of the surface activity of the molecule as well as relative size. Problems faced in drug delivery Other problems persist besides just simply getting through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The first of these is that a lot of times, even if a compound transverses the barrier, it does not do it in a way that the drug is in a therapeutically relevant concentration.Dadparvar, M., Wagner, S., Wien, S., Kufleitner, J., Worek, F., von Briesen, H., & Kreuter, J. (2011). HI 6 human serum albumin nanoparticles‚ÄîDevelopment and transport over an in vitro blood‚Äìbrain barrier model. Toxicology Letters, 206(1), 60-66. This can have many causes, the most simple being that the way the drug was produced only allows a small amount to pass through the barrier. Another cause of this would be the binding to other proteins in the body rendering the drug ineffective to either be therapeutically active or able to pass through the barrier with the adhered protein.Tamai, I., & Tsuji, A. (1996). Drug delivery through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 19(3), 401-424. Another problem that must be accounted for is the presence of enzymes in the brain tissue that could render the drug inactive. The drug may be able to pass through the membrane fine, but will be deconstructed once it is inside the brain tissue rendering it useless. All of these are problems that must be addressed and accounted for in trying to deliver effective drug solutions to the brain tissue. Possible solutions Exosomes to deliver treatments across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier A group from the University of Oxford led by Prof. Matthew Wood claims that exosomes can cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and deliver siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, chemotherapeutic agents and proteins specifically to neurons after inject them systemically (in blood). Because these exosomes are able to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, this protocol could solve the issue of poor delivery of medications to the central nervous system and cure Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease and brain cancer, among other diseases. The laboratory has been recently awarded a major new ‚Ç¨30 million project leading experts from 14 academic institutions, two biotechnology companies and seven pharmaceutical companies to translate the concept to the clinic.Alvarez-Erviti L, Seow Y, Yin H, Betts C, Lakhal S, Wood MJ.

Drugs can be disguised using more lipophillic elements or structures. This form of the drug will be inactive because of the lipophilic molecules but then would be activated, by either enzyme degradation or some other mechanism for removal of the lipophilic disguise to release the drug into its active form. There are still some major drawbacks to these pro-drugs. The first of which is that the pro-drug may be able to pass through the barrier and then also re-pass through the barrier without ever releasing the drug in its active form. The second is the sheer size of these types of molecules makes it still difficult to pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.Breaching the brain's security system. (2001). Consumers' Research Magazine, 84, 21-21-23. Peptide masking Similar to the idea of pro-drugs, another way of masking the drugs chemical composition is by masking a peptide‚Äôs characteristics by combining with other molecular groups that are more likely to pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. An example of this is using a cholesteryl molecule instead of cholesterol that serves to conceal the water soluble characteristics of the drug. This type of masking as well as aiding in traversing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. It also can work to mask the drug peptide from peptide-degrading enzymes in the brain Also a \\"targetor\\" molecule could be attached to the drug that helps it pass through the barrier and then once inside the brain, is degraded in such a way that the drug cannot pass back through the brain. Once the drug cannot pass back through the barrier the drug can be concentrated and made effective for therapeutic use. However drawbacks to this exist as well. Once the drug is in the brain there is a point where it needs to be degraded to prevent overdose to the brain tissue. Also if the drug cannot pass back through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, it compounds the issues of dosage and intense monitoring would be required. For this to be effective there must be a mechanism for the removal of the active form of the drug from the brain tissue. Receptor-mediated permabilitizers These are drug compounds that increase the permeability of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.Secko, D. (2006). Breaking down the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Canadian Medical Association. Journal, 174(4), 448-448. By decreasing the restrictiveness of the barrier, it is much easier to get a molecule to pass through it. These drugs increase the permeability of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier temporarily by increasing the osmotic pressure in the blood which loosens the tight junctions between the endothelial cells. By loosening the tight junctions normal injection of drugs through an [IV] can take place and be effective to enter the brain. This must be done in a very controlled environment because of the risk associated with these drugs. Firstly, the brain can be flooded with molecules that are floating through the blood stream that are usually blocked by the barrier. Secondly, when the tight junctions loosen, the homeostasis of the brain can also be thrown off which can result in seizures and the compromised function of the brain. Nanoparticles The most promising drug delivery system is using nanoparticle delivery systems, these are systems where the drug is bound to a nanoparticle capable of traversing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The most promising compound for the nanoparticles is Human Serum Albumin (HSA). The main benefits of this is that particles made of HSA are well tolerated without serious side effects as well as the albumin functional groups can be utilized for surface modification that allows for specific cell uptake. These nanoparticles have been shown to transverse the blood‚Äìbrain barrier carrying host drugs. To enhance the effectiveness of nanoparticles, scientists are attempting to coat the nanoparticles to make them more effective to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Studies have shown that \\"the overcoating of the [nanoparticles] with polysorbate 80 yielded doxorubicin concentrations in the brain of up to 6 Œºg/g after i.v. injection of 5 mg/kg\\" as compared to no detectable increase in an injection of the drug alone or the uncoated nanoparticle.Wohlfart, S., Khalansky, A. S., Gelperina, S., Begley, D., & Kreuter, J. (2011). Kinetics of transport of doxorubicin bound to nanoparticles across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Journal of Controlled Release, 154(1), 103-107. This is very new science and technology so the real effectiveness of this process has not been fully understood. However young the research is the results are promising pointing to nanotechnology as the way forward in treating a variety of brain diseases. Loaded microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound Microbubbles are small \\"bubbles\\" of mono-lipids that are able to pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. They form a lipophilic bubble that can easily move through the barrier.McDannold, N., Zhang, Y., & Vykhodtseva, N. (2011). Blood‚ÄìBrain Barrier Disruption and Vascular Damage Induced by Ultrasound Bursts Combined with Microbubbles can be Influenced by Choice of Anesthesia Protocol. Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology, 37(8), 1259-1270. One barrier to this however is that these microbubbles are rather large, which prevents their diffusion into the brain. This is counteracted by a focused ultrasound. The ultrasound increases the permeability of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier by causing interference in the tight junctions in localized areas. This combined with the microbubbles allows for a very specific area of diffusion for the microbubbles, because they can only diffuse where the ultrasound is disrupting the barrier. The hypothesis and usefulness of these is the possibility of loading a microbubble with an active drug to diffuse through the barrier and target a specific area. There are several important factors in making this a viable solution for drug delivery. The first is that the loaded microbubble must not be substantially greater than the unloaded bubble. This ensures that the diffusion will be similar and the ultrasound disruption will be enough to induce diffusion. A second factor that must be determined is the stability of the loaded micro-bubble. This means is the drug fully retained in the bubble or is there leakage. Lastly, it must be determined how the drug is to be released from the microbubble once it passes through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Studies have shown the effectiveness of this method for getting drugs to specific sites in the brain in animal models.

He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers. He spent two seasons with the Cowboys (1991‚Äì1992) and one season with the Detroit Lions in 1993. He is distinguished as being the first Trinidadian to play in the National Football League. Early years Richards was born in Trinidad and Tobago, before his family moved to La Porte, Texas, when he was 10 years old. He attended LaPorte High School where he became a starter as a sophomore and produced 1,577 rushing yards. The next year, he finished with 1,106 rushing yards. As a senior a new wishbone offense was implemented, which in turn impacted his carries and production (811 rushing yards). He also played center fielder in baseball, hitting for a .429 average as a senior. College career Richards accepted a football scholarship form the University of Pittsburgh. He was a third-team running back when his freshman season started. After Adam Walker was injured in the first quarter of the fourth game of the season against Boston College, Richards replaced him and rushed for 202 yards. Not only did he keep the starting job but also became a media sensation, earning the nickname \\"Swervin\\" and being compared to Tony Dorsett and Herschel Walker. He finished the season as the Division I-A leading freshman rusher (1,228 rushing yards) and the second freshman in school history to have a 1,000 yard season (after Dorsett). He also had 3 games where he rushed for over 200 yards. The next year, he registered 1,282 rushing yards, becoming only second player in school history to achieve multiple and back-to-back 1,000 yards rushing seasons (after Dorsett). He rushed for a career-high 264 yards against East Carolina University, at the time the fourth best single- game mark in school history. As a junior, he began the year with three straight 100-yard rushing games, before suffering an ankle injury when a lineman fell on his leg during a practice. He lost three games due to this severe sprained ankle and started only three of the last five games of the season, which made his statistics drop to 682 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. The following season, he was suspended indefinitely by new head coach Paul Hackett for missing team meetings and study hall time. News later surfaced that even though he didn't inform the team, he left to be with his sister who was in a coma with a brain tumor and eventually died. This situation made him decide to declare as an early entry into the NFL Draft. Even though he only played for three years, he left as the school's second career rusher with 3,192 yards (behind Dorsett). Professional career Dallas Cowboys Richards was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (97th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft, after he dropped because of a poor junior year. He was the team's second leading rusher in the preseason and had the Cowboys longest run (a 32-yarder). He made the team as the backup to future Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith, but was placed on the injured reserve list after the second game of the season. During the last game of the 1992 regular season, when the Cowboys were playing the Chicago Bears, the team rested most of its regular players in the fourth quarter (including Smith), to prepare for the upcoming playoffs. Richards saw extensive playing time and scored a touchdown, but also committed two costly fumbles in a 27-14 win. The next day, Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson released him, citing the fact that he could not tolerate a running back with a fumbling problem going into the playoffs, even though he would not be able to replace his roster spot by signing a new player, that he would have to pay him in full for all of the remaining games and eventually would have to give him a Super Bowl ring. Thus, Richards missed the entire 1992 postseason, including the Cowboys' 52-17 win over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII. Detroit Lions In 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Detroit Lions. He was released on August 30 and recalled off waivers the next day. He was cut on September 7, after playing in one game. Sacramento Gold Miners On May 19, 1994, he signed with the Sacramento Gold Miners of the Canadian Football League.

It was originally self-published as a four-issue miniseries under a Komikero Publishing imprint between 2006 and 2008 before being collected in a trade paperback in 2009. In 2010, it was published in France by Editions Ca Et La and North America by Slave Labor Graphics. Elmer is set in a world where chickens suddenly gain human-level intelligence and the ability to speak. It focuses on one particular chicken, Jake Gallo, who is part of the second generation of intelligent chickens. When his father dies, Jake inherits a diary chronicling a struggle for equal rights that spans twenty years. It was favorably compared to George Orwell's Animal Farm and received critical acclaim for its art and seriousness. It won two awards in France and was nominated for one in North America. Publication history Production Alanguilan grew up in San Pablo, Laguna, a city in a fairly rural area of the Philippines where chickens roam freely through the streets. By the mid 1990s, he was established in the American comic industry as an inker for popular artists such as Whilce Portacio and Leinil Yu and his work had been published by DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and Image Comics.Allen, Christopher (2011), \\"Christopher Allen Reviews Elmer,\\" Trouble With Comics. Retrieved January 13, 2017 He had been fascinated by chickens his whole life and had been making comic strips about them since 1997. He distributed these strips as photocopied minicomics under the title Crest Hut Butt Shop. One of the features was \\"Stupid Chicken Stories\\". In 2005, he set out to do a sequel, Ultimate Chicken Story, which he intended to be \\"the most hysterically ridiculous story about chickens ever written.\\" He spent more than a year researching chickens before he began writing, and the idea became more serious as he explored it, developing into \\"an opportunity to tell a story that isn't really about chickens, but of humanity in general, and how we treat each other.\\" The first draft was very different from what was eventually published because he removed parts he felt were too sensational or dramatized. In the first draft, the story was told entirely from the point of view of Elmer, an intelligent chicken who is also an actor. Influenced by David Beauchard‚Äôs Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli‚Äôs City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary and read about the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his \\"fears of losing them as they get older.\\" The original opening scene was a human attacking a chicken before being revealed as a film production. Alanguilan believed the scene was too much of a gimmick and moved it to the middle of the book. Although a comic book about sentient chickens could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided to make it an outright drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience. He began drawing the comic book in early 2005 with traditional art tools such as Mongol pencils and brushes.(January 28, 2009), \\"10 Questions for Gerry Alanguilan,\\" Comics Career.

Retrieved January 13, 2017 To devote time to completing the comic book, he had to quit his job working for US comic companies. As a result, the period between 2006 and 2008 was one of the most financially difficult times of his life. Publication Alanguilan did not expect Elmer to be as successful as it later became, but he knew it was good enough to pay for professional printing. He self-published it in the Philippines between 2006 and 2008 as a four-issue miniseries under the name \\"Komikero Publishing.\\" The second and third issues had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. In 2006, he sent copies of the first issue to online columnists, reviewers, retailers, and industry insiders to let people know it existed. This self- promotion led the book to get good reviews from well-known writers like Steven Grant and Neil Gaiman and a widely read interview with Tom Spurgeon on \\"The Comics Reporter.\\" The Spurgeon interview led the entertainment megastore Forbidden Planet to order copies directly from Alanguilan and promote it with special offers. After the series was complete, Alanguilan offered all four issues in a special box set release, followed by a Filipino edition trade paperback in 2009.Alanguilan, Gerry (2011), from the afterword in the Elmer trade paperback, Slave Labor Graphics When the first edition of the Filipino collection was about to sell out in 2011, National Book Store offered to finance and print a second edition for Alanguilan.

Plot In 1979, an unexplained phenomenon causes the sky to flash white. Afterward, every chicken around the world develops instantaneous intelligence on par with humans. They are also able to speak clearly. In 2003, second-generation intelligent chicken Jake Gallo is struggling to fit into a society he does not believe respects him. When his father, Elmer, falls ill, Jake returns to his childhood home in the remote countryside (hinted though never explicitly stated to be in Alanguilan's native Philippines). He reunites with his mother Helen, his brother Frankie, his sister May, and his parents‚Äô human neighbor and friend, Ben. Elmer, who is in a coma, does not wake up and Jake does not get to say goodbye. Per Elmer's request, Helen gives his diary to Jake. Jake glances through it and realizes it is a record of events after chickens gained human intelligence, beginning with Elmer's memories of the first day. He reads a random section in which Elmer and his brother Joseph were attacked by Ben. Jake confronts Ben and accuses him of only pretending to be his parents‚Äô friend. Ben becomes angry and tells Jake that it was a different time, and that he would not understand. Ben reveals that there were a few chickens who became intelligent prior to 1979, and that he met one at the poultry where he worked. Ben recognized that the chicken was aware, but he beat it to death with a brick out of fear. This filled him with guilt, so when all chickens gained awareness he protected the three he could ‚Äì Elmer, Helen, and Joseph. Ben suggests Jake read the whole diary from beginning and offers to add context if he can. Elmer recounts the initial violent backlash by humanity and how Ben hid the three of them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans to prevent the spread of the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children. While he reads the diary over the course of several months, Jake is confronted by his siblings about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister's human fianc√©e and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father's diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‚Äò‚ÄôGallus Rex‚Äô‚Äô, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake‚Äôs perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary. Jake turns his father‚Äôs diary into a successful book and begins dating the actress he met on the movie set. Critical reception The art in Elmer was praised for its seriousness. Elmer received mostly positive reviews from critics, winning the French ACBD Prix Asie (Asia Prize for Criticism) Award and the Prix Quai des Bulles Award in 2011 and being nominated for the 2011 Best New Graphic Album Eisner Award.Rumpus, Ron (July 18, 2011), \\"RonReads Interview: Gerry Alanguilan,\\" Ron Reads.

Origins Dodderidge was a son of Richard Doddridge, merchant, of Barnstaple. His elder brother was Sir John Dodderidge (1555‚Äì1628), of Bremridge, near South Molton, Devon, Justice of the King's Bench in 1612 and MP for Barnstaple in 1589 and for Horsham in 1604, whose splendid recumbent effigy exists in the Lady Chapel of Exeter Cathedral. 1617 carved oak chimneypiece formerly in the Dodderidge House, Cross Street, Barnstaple, decorated with two strapwork panels inhabited by putti and showing at middle top the date 1617 with to the left the initials \\"PD\\" (for Pentecost Dodderidge (d.circa 1650)) and to right \\"ED\\" (for Elizabeth Wescombe his wife).

Richard Dodderidge was the son of a wool merchant and was born in South Molton, in which town he married. With his wife and eight children before 1582 he moved to Holland Street, Barnstaple and served as Mayor of Barnstaple in 1589.Lamplugh, p. 52 A certain John Dodderidge, perhaps a relation, is recorded earlier in 1579 as mayor of Barnstaple.Lamplugh, p. 156 In 1585 Richard bought a house in Cross Street from his fellow burgess Thomas Skinner, which descended in turn to his sons Sir John and to the latter's brother Pentecost Dodderidge (d. circa 1650.Lamplugh, p.156 This large timber-framed house, known as the \\"Dodderidge House\\" was demolished in about 1900 to make way for a post office, the present large sandstone building with the date \\"1901\\" sculpted on its parapet. A room of ornate carved oak panelling dated 1617 from this house survives in Barnstaple Guildhall, known as the \\"Dodderidge Room\\" and an ornate overmantel displays the date 1617 between the initials \\"PD\\" and \\"ED\\", signifying Pentecost and his wife Elizabeth.Lamplugh, p.134 The room is now used to display the Corporation's silver and the mayor's regalia. Richard entered the shipping business and owned a 100-ton prize-ship named Prudence, a privateer effectively engaged in licensed piracy. She is recorded as having had 80 men on board in 1590, and landed a record prize taken off the Guinea Coast, probably from Spanish galleons from South America, consisting of four chests of gold worth ¬£16,000 with in addition chains of gold and civet-fur. The gold landed at Barnstaple from this voyage weighed 320 lbs. Between June and October 1590 Prudence sent back to Barnstaple two further prizes of unrecorded value and in January 1592 brought in a prize of ¬£10,000. In March 1596 the Privy Council ordered the mayor of Barnstaple to send a ship to challenge two or three Spanish ships in the Irish Sea and the Prudence was selected for this task. She was victualled for five months, for a crew of 40, at a cost exceeding ¬£900, borne by the North Devon population. On 8 August 1596 she returned to Barnstaple, loaded with much pillage taken during the attack on Cadiz conducted by Lords Essex and Howard.Lamplugh, pp. 52‚Äì54 Richard received at some time letters patent as one of six west country merchants licensed to trade with \\"the River of Senegal and Gambia in Guinea\\".Lamplugh, Lois, Barnstaple: Town on the Taw, South Molton, 2002, p.62 Richard presented to the Corporation of Barnstaple \\"a great boale with its covering, wrought in silver and a silver-gilt table lamp\\".Lamplugh, pp.53 Career He was Mayor of Barnstaple in 1611, 1627 and 1637,Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries 1901 and in 1621 was elected Member of Parliament for Barnstaple and was re-elected MP for Barnstaple in 1624 and 1625.Browne Willis Notitia parliamentaria, or, An history of the counties, cities, and boroughs in England and Wales: ...

Early life Pat Montandon was born on December 26, 1928. The daughter of an itinerant Nazarene Church Texas minister, Charles Clay Montandon, and his wife Myrtle Taylor, she grew up in Oklahoma during the peak of the Great Depression. In the 1960s Pat was living in San Francisco,The manuscript version of her birth certificate can be read Patsy Sue or Patsy Lue but the typescript version is Patsy Lue. where she became a columnist and popular television host. During this time Pat became known for her talent giving themed and memorable parties. She once dated Frank Sinatra. Roundtable Luncheons Passionate about facilitating authentic conversation between friends and strangers alike, in the 1970s Montandon began hosting what would soon become a life-long passion and pleasure, her legendary Roundtable Luncheons. Over the years she has welcomed a diverse range of people into her home to break bread and learn from one another. Four decades of hosting her Roundtables has allowed her to forge both professional alliances and lasting friendships with hundreds of guests, including people she'd just met on the street and well-known public figures and celebrities such as Steve Martin, Nancy Pelosi, Betty Friedan, Eldridge Cleaver, Alex Hayley, Gloria Steinem, Billy Graham and many more. Far from meaningless chatter, Pat's Roundtables were places of deep discussion and no topic was taboo. Attendees have discussed topics such as rape, racism, war, writing, childhood trauma and how to make the world a better place. The Roundtables are ongoing. Career In 1960, she moved to San Francisco, where she hosted a TV show and became a newspaper columnist for the San Francisco Examiner. After a summer of managing a Joseph Magnin clothing store, she became a darling of the society columns through her creative skills as a party giver. In 1979, Pat Montandon created the idea for the Napa Valley Wine Auction, which has become the most successful auction of its kind. She consulted with friend and vintner Robert Mondavi to present the idea to area vintners. Her unexpected divorce compelled Montandon to give her idea to the Napa Valley vintners with her portion of the proceeds benefitting two Napa Valley hospitals. She is the author of numerous non-fiction books, including the NY Times bestseller How to be a Party Girl, The Intruders, Whispers from God: A Life Beyond Imaginings, and Oh the Hell of it All. Additionally she wrote a book called \\"Celebrities and Their Angels\\" as well as \\"Making Friends\\" about Katya from Moscow and Star from San Francisco; two eleven-year-old girls discovering America together; this was the first book co-published in both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Her most recent book, a second memoir titled Peeing on Hot Coals, was released in 2014. Humanitarian works Montandon is an activist for women's rights, and in 1970 she founded The Name Choice Center to inform women of their right to keep their own name after marriage. In 1982, Montandon founded a peace group, Children as Teachers for Peace (later renamed Children as the Peacemakers).‚ÄúPeace Organizations, Past and Present; a Survey and Directory‚Äù, by Robert S. Meyer. McFarland, 1988, p. 79. She auctioned her couture wardrobe, jewels and furs to fund the organization and its many accomplishments. Montandon has made 37 international trips with grade-school children, and has had substantive meetings with 26 world leaders such as China's Premier Zhao Ziyang, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Pope John Paul II, the late Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Mother Teresa. She collects letters written by schoolchildren, urging an end to nuclear proliferation, and has delivered food and supplies to needy children in Russia and Ethiopia. In 1987, Montandon designed the Banner of Hope. Now, a mile-long, the red-silk memorial inscribed with the names and ages of children killed in war, was first exhibited in the Kremlin at an International Women's Congress.http://instantweb.com/w/worldtrust/news.html. Retrieved 11.30.11. The Banner was highlighted at opening ceremonies of the United Nations, unfurled on the Great Wall of China, and in 2005, enveloped a school in Beslan, Russia after the massacre there. In 2018 Pat rebranded her organization, now called Peace To The Planet, providing kids a platform to stop gun violence and fight global warming. Peace To The Planet is completing a new banner, similar to the Banner of Hope, showing the faces and names of children killed in gun violence. Awards and honors Montandon was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize three successive years and received the UN Peace Messenger award in 1987. Montandon's peace work has been honored with awards from Turkey, El Salvador, The People's Republic of China, India, and Norway, and she received the Russian Federation‚Äôs Medal in Memory of Anne Frank, Sadako, Tanya Savicheva and Samantha Smith. In 2014 Dr. Jitu Rajgor, a long time admirer and friend of Montandon‚Äôs, founded a women‚Äôs health facility in her honor at his clinic in Ahmedabad, India. At Pat Montandon's Women Health Care clinic they treat women of all ages who have little ability to pay for health care. Personal life Montandon was married three times. Her first marriage, to Howard Groves in 1947, lasted 12 years. In the 1960s she had a short-lived marriage to flamboyant attorney Melvin Belli. In 1969 she married butter baron and billionaire Al Wilsey and the next year she had her only child, best- selling author Sean Wilsey. As a society wife, Montandon \\"acquired a reputation for giving the best parties and round-table luncheons.\\" Wilsey later had an affair with Montandon's married best friend, Dede Traina, before he filed for divorce in 1980 in order to marry Traina. Montandon was devastated and the divorce proceedings played out publicly. Gossip columns raked Montandon over the coals, claiming as unreasonable her right to fairly split the couple's assets and to receive alimony. In 1975, she won a lawsuit she brought against Triangle Publications whose publications impugned her reputation.Newark, Ohio, Advocate, 10-15-75: She received in Triangle Publications vs. Montandon (75-195) a $150,000 judgement for the publication of a statement that was based on two court actions said that she was a call girl.

Until 2007, she was lead hardware engineer for the ISS Health Maintenance System, leading a team of engineers whose job was to provide reliable medical equipment that kept astronauts healthy in orbit. She subsequently served as the lead hardware engineer for the ISS Human Research Facility. She served as an aquanaut on the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations 6 (NEEMO 6) crew in July 2004.  Education  Ruttley was born in Houma, Louisiana, and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana. Since Ruttley had always loved biology and physiology, she started her educational journey focusing on a career in life sciences. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Biomedical Engineering from Colorado State University (CSU), where she was a member of the Class of 2000. She also received a Ph.D in Neuroscience in 2007 from University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Ruttley was a McNair Scholar at CSU. At CSU, Ruttley became involved with the Colorado Space Grant Consortium and the student branch of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). As an undergraduate, and through her participation in student design conferences, she became more interested in the hardware aspects of maintaining optimal crew health in space. Ruttley soon realized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to designing hardware for crew health, so she pursued her master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Ruttley also belonged to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Sigma Xi while attending CSU. Ruttley's master's thesis was the testing of a novel gravity-independent resistive exercise device, the Constant Force Resistive Exercise Unit (CFREU), which she had developed in collaboration with CSU's AIAA student design team. The team had tested one version of the machine in microgravity aboard NASA's KC-135 aircraft. They subsequently received a $70,000 contract from NASA to develop an improved prototype. Ruttley and her husband, Paul Colosky, patented the CFREU design when they graduated from CSU.  NASA career  NEEMO 6 crew. L-R: John Herrington, Ruttley, Nicholas Patrick, Douglas H. Wheelock. Not pictured: support crew members Craig B. Cooper and Joseph March. Ruttley received an offer to work for NASA's Biomedical Systems Division upon graduation. She came to work for NASA in January 2001, where her first project was developing a detector for the presence of hydrazine on astronauts' space suits after EVAs from the ISS. She went on to become a project engineer for the exercise bicycle currently on the ISS. Ruttley subsequently served as lead hardware engineer for the ISS Human Research Facility, and later became Associate Program Scientist for the ISS. In 2010, Ruttley responded to criticisms of the cost of the ISS, saying, \\"I think those who are naysayers haven't given us a chance ‚Äî haven't given us enough time to show what we can do.\\" In a 2011 interview, Ruttley offered reassurance to scientists concerned that the end of the Space Shuttle program would interfere with ISS research projects, saying, \\"If you have an investigation you want to do on the space station, we will get you there.\\" In July 2004, Ruttley became an aquanaut through her participation in the joint NASA-NOAA, NEEMO 6 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. Ruttley and her crewmates lived and worked underwater for ten days. During the NEEMO 6 mission, Ruttley represented the JSC Engineering Directorate as an Engineer/Aquanaut and was in charge of leading the hardware experiments. A redesigned version of the CFREU was evaluated for potential spaceflight use during the NEEMO 6 mission. On the final day of NEEMO 6, Ruttley wrote, \\"The physical and mental challenge for me was the best of my life.\\" Ruttley teaches undergraduate courses in human physiology as an adjunct professor at University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake. In April 2008, she received the Graduate of the Last Decade (GOLD) Award from the Colorado State University College of Engineering. Ruttley is working with the National Science Foundation on an inflatable Antarctic habitat that would serve as an analog for lunar or Martian habitats.  Personal life  Ruttley lives in Virginia, with her husband Paul Colosky, the owner of Valeo Physical Therapy, and daughter Anna-Marie. In her spare time, Ruttley enjoys scuba diving, cooking, home-improvement projects, eating good food, and being with her husband and friends. She has bicycled from Houston to Austin, Texas, for the MS150, a fundraising event for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. She is a certified Emergency Medical Technician and serves as a motivational speaker to undergraduates with the Council for Opportunity in Education.

Baskin The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture p134-135 2011 \\"The biblical law of \\"uncircumcised\\" fruit (orlah) prohibits consuming fruit picked from a tree in the Land of Israel within three years of its planting (Lev 19:23). According to rabbinic interpretation of \\"fourth-year planting\\" (neta revai) ...may only be eaten in Jerusalem unless it is redeemed. The Hebrew word orlah literally means \\"uncircumcised\\". This meaning is often footnoted in English translations: In rabbinical writings the orlah-prohibition (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ô◊°◊ï◊® ◊¢◊®◊ú◊î) is counted as one of the negative commandments among the rabbinical enumeration of 613 commandments. Outside of the land of Israel the prohibition also applies to a certain degree.  Bible  Commentators generally assume that the law was good agricultural practice, and that early harvesting would conflict with careful cultivation and pruning during the first three years in order to insure later good harvests and allow maturing of the trees.The Ivp Bible Background Commentary: Genesis-Deuteronomy p163 John H. Walton, Victor H. Matthews - 2000 \\"Careful cultivation and pruning was necessary during the first three years in order to insure eventual good harvests and proper maturing of the trees. The fruit during this period could not be eaten and was declared unclean (literally, 'uncircumcised.') Grape vines produce fruit in three to six years, almond trees produce some flower buds in the fourth year and some fruit in the fifth, and sources from the Ancient Near East suggest that a good crop of dates was expected in the fourth year.Trees, Earth, and Torah: A Tu B'Shvat Anthology p51 Ari Elon, Naomi M. Hyman, Arthur Waskow - 2000 previously printed in The savage in Judaism: an anthropology of Israelite religion Howard Eilberg-Schwartz - 1990 \\"Grape seedlings produce fruit in three to six years, and almond trees produce some flower buds in the fourth year and some fruit in the fifth (Janick and Moore 1975, 138, 396). Ancient sources confirm that ancient fruit trees produced ... In discussing the commandment that the fruit could not actually be eaten until the fifth year, Rooker (2000) notes that in the Code of Hammurabi a tenant-gardener could not eat of the fruit of an orchard until the fifth year, when he shared the produce with the owner.Leviticus p260 Mark F. Rooker, Dennis R. Cole - 2000 \\"155 In the Code of Hammurabi #60 it was legislated that a gardener who was also a tenant could not eat of the fruit of his orchard until the fifth year, when he shared the produce with the owner.\\"See the Code of Hammurabi, as translated by L. W. King, #60. Rabbinical writings  Mishnah  The Mishna stipulates that Orlah fruit must be burnt to guarantee that no one benefits from them (Mishnah, Temurah 33b), and even a garment dyed by way of pigment derived from orlah is to be destroyed (Mishnah, Orlah 3:1).  Sifra  The Sifra (to Leviticus 19:24) points out that the three year count begins on Rosh HaShana (the Jewish new year) and not \\"tree years\\" (the Jewish agricultural holiday of Tu Bishvat). Thus, the fruit of a tree only two years and 30 days old may not be considered forbidden.  Jerusalem Talmud  The Jerusalem Talmud stipulates that \\"sofek orlah\\" (uncertainty if the product is indeed orlah) is permitted outside of the land of Israel (Orlah (Talmud) 20b). However, Rabbi Yochanan, in a letter sent to Rabbi Yehudah and quoted in the Babylonian Talmud, took a starkly stringent approach to the common practice of diasporic Jewry being overly lenient on \\"safek orlah\\";  Outside of the land of Israel  Although the mitzvah of orlah is listed in the category of prohibitions pertaining to the Land of Israel alone (\\"◊û◊¶◊ï◊ï◊î ◊©◊™◊ú◊ï◊ô◊î ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú\\"), it is the only mitzvah of this category that applies outside of Israel as well - with certain leniencies (mishna, Kidushin ch. 1, Mishna 9). This application is forthcoming due to it being listed as a \\"Halakhah LeMoshe MiSinai\\" (a law given to Moses at Sinai, Sifra, 23:14). The tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus holds the opinion that the prohibition of orlah does not apply outside the land of Israel at all.Tosefta, Orlah, ch. 1  Questionable fruit  Faced with an uncertainty as to whether an item is orlah (or a result of orlah usage such as dye, etc.), the mishna prescribes that such product is permitted for consumption so long as the actual removal of orlah product is not \\"seen\\" being picked (Mishnah, Orlah, ch. 3). The papaya fruit is a subject of rabbinic dispute. Some rabbinic authorities maintain that the papaya is not a tree, thus making it orlah-exempt,Rav Pe‚Äôalim responsa (Vol. 2, Orach Chayim #30), responsa Yechaveh Daath 4:52 whereas most rule that the laws of orlah do apply to the papaya.Shevat Halevi 6:165; Mishpetei Aretz, page 27, quoting Rav Elyashiv; Teshuvos VeHanhagos Papain, (a \\"second crop\\" enzyme extracted from the papaya peel, used in beer, biscuits, and as a digestive aid) is likewise under rabbinic scrutiny as a dilution ratio of 200:1 (200 non-orlah fruit to 1 part orlah) is required to permit orlah, essentially prohibiting benefiting from this enzyme.  Use of the term \\"uncircumcised\\"  The term \\"uncircumcised\\" is explained by Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz as meaning \\"hidden and sealed\\" and it alludes to the creation itself.Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz Keli Yekar on Leviticus 19:23  Practice in modern Israel In the State of Israel the laws of orlah have been observed literally. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel has allowed the sale of such fruit to non-Jews, but the usual policy is to destroy it.Judaism and modernization on the religious kibbutz p127 Aryei Fishman - 1992 For example, the laws of \\"uncircumcised fruit\\" (Leviticus 19:23- 24) have always been observed literally.

It was built on the site of the former Leith Central railway station. It was the only pool in Edinburgh with flumes, and there was also a fast river run. It was closed in January 2012 in order to save funds for the Royal Commonwealth Pool's renovation and re-opening. A campaigning group against the closure, called Splashback, were funded to carry out feasibility studies but the property has been converted into a children's soft-play centre. History The pool opened in 1992, and was then closed in November 1999 after problems were found including tiles coming away from walls, electrical problems and rusting structures. It reopened in 2002 and a new multisensory play area was introduced in 2003. Repairs were estimated to have cost ¬£270,000. There were previous threats to close the pool to save money in 1997 and 2005. On 22 December 2011 Edinburgh Council voted to close the pool. It closed on 8 January 2012. Campaigners continued to protest and lodged an official complaint against the closure. The closed pool became an issue in the Edinburgh 2012 elections, referenced at local hustings. In September 2012, Splashback's bid to reopen the facility was rejected and they were told to come back with a better submission. In May 2013 the decision was made to accept a proposal to redevelop the premises as a soft-play area. Splashback accused Edinburgh councillor Richard Lewis of breaking his word about reopening the pool.

Early life and education Dame Anne Glover Glover was born on 19 April 1956 to Mary Johnstone and Wesley Glover. She was educated at the High School of Dundee and studied at the University of Edinburgh for a BSc (Hons) degree in biochemistry, passing with first class honours in 1978. She went on to study at King's College, Cambridge, where she obtained an MPhil degree in 1979 and a PhD degree in 1981 on the biosynthesis of halobacterial membrane proteins. Career and research From August 2006 to December 2011, she was the first ever Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland, where her role was to further enhance Scotland's reputation as a science nation. She was joint chair of the Scottish Science Advisory Committee and served on the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers until her appointment to the European Commission in 2012. Glover holds a Personal Chair of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Aberdeen, along with honorary positions at the Macaulay and Rowett Institutes, and the University of New South Wales, Sydney. European Commission Chief Scientific Adviser to the European Commission, Anne Glover, visits ESO's Paranal Observatory. Glover's role as Chief Scientific Adviser included provision of independent expert advice on any aspect of science, technology and innovation as requested by the President of the European Commission. She also acted as an ambassador for European science, both promoting and communicating the benefits and values of science in Europe.\\"Appointment of Chief Scientific Adviser\\" , Europa, Brussels, 5 December 2011; retrieved 29 February 2012. She presided over a substantial growth in the role of the Chief Scientific Adviser, from a position with almost no resources to an influential voice in European science policy. She consistently emphasised the need for the European Commission's science policy to be firmly based on evidence. On 13 and 14 November 2014, it was reported by the BBC and The Times that the Chief Scientific Adviser's post would be abolished, following lobbying from nongovernmental organisations, including green groups who disagreed with Professor Glover's support for evidence based policy, including genetically modified crops, after the president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker decided to close the Bureau of European Policy Advisers. An article in New Scientist earlier in the year highlighted the controversy concerning the proposals for abolition. By 2016, the post of Chief Scientific Adviser to the European Commission had been replaced by the Scientific Advice Mechanism, which combined a group of seven Advisors with an independent evidence review process provided by European academies in the SAPEA consortium. Honours and awards Glover was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2005), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (2009; formerly the Institute of Biology) a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (2009) and the American Society for Microbiology (1995).

MICC is dedicated to teaching and preserving the indigenous cultures of M√©xico and the southwestern United States. In 1992 MICC received recognition for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a community based, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that is dedicated to bringing knowledge of the indigenous/Mestizo living traditions of Mexico back to the Chicano/Latino communities of the U.S. Danza Mexi'cayotl, through MICC has collected this knowledge from indigenous and mestizo people that still live the traditional ways of life, as well as from academic, scientific, and artistic sources that have carried out rigorous research using western and non-western hermeneutics and ontologies to document, and teach living mesoamerican cultural, linguistic, and spiritual traditions. Danza Mexi'cayotl is a collective of Chican, Mexicano, and Latinoamericano persons who are interested in creating a \\"third space\\" of an Indigenous community that gives a safe, nurturing place for people who are accepted neither within the dominant U.S. culture, nor the communities of Mexico. Chicanos, because of their skin color, language, and cultural heritage will never be seen as truly \\"American\\" by some members of white U.S. society. And because many Chicanos do not speak Spanish, and are closely identified with the Anglo-Saxon culture of the U.S.,they will always remain as outsiders or \\"gringos\\" to many Mexicans.Aguilar, M.

Danza Mexi'cayotl makes this knowledge, available to students, teachers, and others who want to begin their journey into a more traditional way of life. Danza Mexi'cayotl focuses on serving multicultural youth, especially those low- income families that may not have other opportunities to gain access to traditional and living knowledge. Using traditional media such as oral, musical, and choreographic semiotics, and modern means of communication (websites, Facebook, Adobe Acrobat .PDF files and blogs), Danza Mexi'cayotl, through MICC, has extended is educational outreach to the entire globe.

In the early 1930s she toured the United States with a dance troupe, but left and returned to her native Los Angeles during the Depression. She briefly dated an up-and-coming, but still largely unknown, actor named Anthony Quinn.Dona Hardy profile She was the Executive Director of a United Way affiliate, and retired at age 66, when she looked to begin her acting career.Obituary for Jean Dona Hardekopf Acting career Hardy began her acting career late in life, usually playing sweet, sometimes deceptively harmless-looking old ladies. During her acting career, Hardy bedded John Ritter, kissed Matthew Perry, and, fitted with a walker, was asked by faux- auteur Jerry Stiller (in an episode of The King of Queens) to consider \\"some tasteful nudity\\" for a community theater production of The Gin Game. She worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson in her first film credit, the Stephen King-penned thriller, The Running Man, in which she had played \\"Mrs. McArdle\\" and had to say a certain 12 letter hyphenated vulgarism. \\"There is nothing that people enjoy so much as hearing old people say dirty words....

He is a bilingual author of poetry and prose in English and German. He studied classical philology, with a concentration on ancient Greek, as well as Catholic theology at the National University of Ireland in Maynooth and at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. His work has led him on the search for modern-day mythologies. He describes his approach as mythical realism. Campbell's contributions have been featured and published in German and American literary magazines including Lichtungen, World Literature Today, Hessischer Literaturebote, Akzente, entw√ºrfe, and Cordite Poetry Review.etcetera, etcetera, Jubil√§umsausgabe Nr. 50 , Essay: Literatur vor 2045, November 2012 Personal life Campbell was born 1982 in Boston, Massachusetts, to a former U. S. Army officer and a German nurse. He grew up in Massachusetts and moved with his family to Germany, where he completed his final secondary school examinations (Abitur) in Bavaria. Campbell was born with a serious heart condition and has carried a pacemaker since the age of 24. He also had a life- threatening brain tumor removed at the Boston Children's Hospital at age 10, and has been epileptic ever since. Currently, he is preparing a dissertation in Foundational Theology at the Jesuit Seminary, Sankt Georgen, in Frankfurt/Main, Germany. Works and views For his poetry collection \\"nach den narkosen\\" (German: \\"after anesthesia\\" 2017), he received the Bavarian Arts and Literary Prize. The same book was listed by Gregor Dotzauer at Literaturhaus Berlin as one of the ten best poetry collections in 2017 and recommended by the German Academy for Language and Literature for 2018 by Uljana Wolf. Campbell is primarily a poet. Moving away from themes, such as space exploration, the Pontiac Firebird Trans-Am, New York's A-train, the aircraft carrier or Concorde,Main-Echo, Sprachliche Schwerelosigkeit, May 5, 2012 his poetry now deals with living with disability in terms of living an artificial life. Campbell draws on his personal experience with a major heart defect (univentricle) and his reliance on a pacemaker. In reference to Judith Butler¬¥s notion of heteronormativity, Campbell coined the term \\"salutonormativity\\" which assumes that general discourse is imagined from the perspective of healthy life \\\\- institutions, laws, visions of a good life, and language are dominated by health. In his book \\"after anesthesia\\", Campbell focuses on fragile, insufficient, sick and infected language. His poetry questions the paradigm of healthy language. After working with the Leipzig- based painter Aris Kalaizis for several years, Campbell published several essays on contemporary painting, especially on painters from the former GDR, such as Hartwig Ebersbach, Arno Rink, Michael Morgner, Sighard Gille or Aris Kalaizis. In January 2013, Paul-Henri Campbell was called onto the editorial board of DAS GEDICHT, one of largest poetry magazines in the German language. Together with Michael Augustin and Anton G. Leitner he initiated the annual anthology DAS GEDICHT chapbook. German Poetry Now. Its goal is to present contemporary German poetry to an international audience in English translation.Bamberger Onlinezeitung, Meinen Sie, Z√ºrich zum Beispiel?

Or if it is an obsession, a glitch in the economy of emotions, or even a delusion. True love? ‚Äì No. Certainly not. Thematically, a lot of Campbell's narratives could possibly be found in the work of Raymond Carver. Even though in the case of Carver, the stories would not have the consequences which they have here. Because: Campbell's stories decidedly have consequences. They are not only stories of human relationships that are all somehow instable, abysmally filled by voids and depths, insecurities, false bottoms.

He initially planned to study theology at Innsbruck, but instead enrolled to take classes in medicine, later relocating to the University of Landshut. Political turmoil made his stays at both institutions brief, and in 1809 transferred to the University of Pavia. In 1815 he received his degree in medicine, followed by a doctorate in surgery shortly afterwards. On advice from Antonio Scarpa (1752‚Äì1832), he studied ophthalmology in the clinic of Georg Joseph Beer (1763‚Äì1821) at the University of Vienna, where he obtained a degree in 1817. Following his return to Pavia, he worked as an assistant in the anatomy laboratory of Bartolomeo Panizza (1785‚Äì1867). In 1819 Flarer was appointed professor of theoretical and practical ophthalmology at Pavia. In 1832‚Äì33 he was named university rector, and in 1854 was appointed dean of the medical faculty. Among his written works was a treatise on iritis (De iritide eiusque speciebus earumque curatione) that won an award from the Acad√©mie Royale de M√©decine of Paris in 1836. Another noted work of his was a study of eyelid/eyelash maladies titled Riflessioni sulla Trichiasi, sulla Distichiasi e sull'Entropio, avuto particolare riguardo ai metodi di Jaeger e di Vacc√† (Reflections on trichiasis, distichiasis and entropion, with particular regard to the methods of Friedrich J√§ger von Jaxtthal (1784‚Äì1871) and Andrea Vacc√° Berlinghieri (1772‚Äì1826).

Markeviƒçius. It covers the inspirational story of the 1992 Lithuania national basketball team and their journey to the bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The film not only looks at the Lithuanian team but also at the broader historical events. The fall of the Soviet Union allowed Lithuania to reestablish its independence and enter the Olympics as an independent country. The film includes interviews with many famous basketball figures, such as Arvydas Sabonis, David Stern, Jim Lampley, Bill Walton, and ≈†ar≈´nas Marƒçiulionis. The title is an allusion to the Dream Team, the first American Olympic basketball team to feature active NBA players. Filming Marius A. Markeviƒçius is a Lithuanian-American director. It took him over three years to make this film. The documentary combines historical footage with new interviews. During filming, the Lithuanians were asked to speak in English for the interviews. But because of the emotional nature of the topic, speaking in their native tongue was easier. A series of cutaway scenes follows an up-and- coming Lithuanian player, Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, from his native Utena to the 2011 NBA draft. The documentary also shows Arvydas Sabonis being inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.‚ÄúThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame - Hall of Famers.‚Äù Accessed January 24, 2014. . Content New York artist Greg Speirs wearing the Grateful Dead-inspired \\"Skully\\" tie-dyed T-shirt which he designed and became a symbol of Lithuanian basketball Lithuanian basketball players, notably Arvydas Sabonis and ≈†ar≈´nas Marƒçiulionis, played for the Soviet Union national basketball team in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. There were four starters from Lithuania who were on the Soviet team. The players were promised that they would be permitted to play on western teams if they won gold, which they did with a 76-63 victory over Yugoslavia. Marƒçiulionis became the first Soviet player to join the NBA. Sabonis was actually the first Lithuanian to be drafted onto an American team, but because of the Iron Curtain he was not allowed to leave. Not only that but Americans did not like that he was a \\"Russian\\" player. (During a TV interview featured in the film, Sabonis pointed out that he was not Russian but Lithuanian.) The Lithuanian team had little money allocated to them for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Because of an article written in a local newspaper, the Grateful Dead was moved by the team's plight and funded their trip to the Olympics. Artist Greg Speirs from New York was also moved by the team's plight and created the iconic Slam-Dunking Skeleton on tie-dye shirts which were made in the colors of the Lithuanian flag. The skeleton slam- dunking a basketball symbolized a phoenix rising from the ashes, according to the artist who created it. The Lithuanian team had no illusions of beating the American Dream Team in the semifinals, and the U.S. ended up winning 127-76. In the bronze medal game, however, Lithuania was pitted against the Unified Team, made up of all of the post-Soviet states except the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The game became a larger symbol of a reborn Lithuania fighting for its freedom and recognition. It was a close, nerve- wracking game that the Lithuanians desperately wanted to win. In the end, the Lithuanians defeated the Unified Team 82-78. The team wore their slam dunking skeleton tie-dye uniforms to accept their bronze medals. Reception The movie was an official selection for the Sundance Film Festival and entered in the U.S. Documentary Competition in 2012. It received 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It had a limited theatrical release starting September 28, 2012. It was also nominated for the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary in 2012. Aftermath Not only does the documentary look at the events leading up to the 1992 Olympics, it also shows an up and coming Lithuanian player, Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, before the NBA draft in 2011, presenting his success as the culmination of what his parents fought for. The documentary also shows Arvydas Sabonis being inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. Sales of the tie-dyed T-shirts continued, and the skeleton art's creator, Greg Speirs, donated 100% of his profits, ultimately totaling $450,000, to continue to fund the team as well as Lithuanian children's charities, thus acquiring 'major sponsor' status.

In 1614, he was again sent on a successful mission to France. In 1620, Emperor Ferdinand II made Johann Georg a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and in on 23 March 1623, he was made an Imperial Prince, together with 22 other imperial counts, including the counts of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern-Haigerloch.

Common areas of study include psychosocial development, environmental factors which contribute to the development of a disorder, outcomes of children with medical conditions, treating the comorbid behavioral and emotional components of illness and injury, and promoting proper health behaviors, developmental disabilities, educating psychologists and other health professionals on the psychological aspects of pediatric conditions, and advocating for public policy that promotes children's health.Who We Are. (2012). Retrieved from American Psychological Association Online http://www.apadivisions.org/division-54/about/index.aspx  Role of the pediatric psychologist  The field of pediatric psychology developed to address unmet needs for psychological services in the pediatric setting and the field blends together several distinct areas in psychology (such as behavioral medicine, health psychology, developmental psychology, etc.) (Roberts, Maddux, Wurtele, & Wright, 1982 Roberts, M.C., Maddux, J., Wurtele, S.K., & Wright, L. (1982). Pediatric psychology: Health care psychology for children In T. Millon, C.J. Green, & R.B. Meagher (Eds.), Handbook of clinical health care psychology (pp. 191‚Äì226). New York: Plenum Press.). Pediatric psychology is an integrated field of science and practice in which the principles of psychology are applied within the environment of pediatric health. The Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP, Division 54) resides under the American Psychological Association (APA), see http://www.apadivisions.org/division-54/index.aspx. SPP aims to promote health and psychological well-being of children, adolescents, and their families through the promotion of evidence-based science and practice, education, training, and advocacy. The field was founded in 1969 and includes a broad interdisciplinary foundation, drawing on clinical, developmental, social, cognitive, behavioral, counseling, community and school psychology. Pediatric psychologists work in a variety of settings and fulfill various roles such as (Spirito, 2003 ): (1) Providing psychosocial services for problems related to pediatric health conditions (2) Psychological services for mental health problems appearing in medical settings‚Äîwhich involves mental issues related to medical conditions or the treatment of them, coping related to chronic and acute illnesses, adherence, quality of life, pain, traumatic medical stress, adjustment related issues on the psycho-social continuum, school reintegration, and behavioral problems (3) Psychological services for mental health problems without concomitant health condition (4) Programs for promotion of health/prevention and early intervention (5) Provide assistance for those with Mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities (6) Psychological training and consultation for physicians (7) Public health and public policy. Interventions are not just illness-related, but address behavioral problems as well. The settings that pediatric psychologists work in allows for brief interventions that are economical and time efficient. Collaboration with the health care providers allows for more targeted assessment and interventions. Pediatric healthcare providers seem to value the work of pediatric psychologists (Stancin, Perrin, and Ramirez, 2009):Stancin, T., Perrin, E. C., & Ramirez, L. (2009). Pediatric Psychology and Primary Care In M. C. Roberts, & Steele, R. C (Ed.), Handbook of pediatric psychology (Vol. 4th pp. 630‚Äì646). New York: Guilford. \\"Recently, a surge of interest by pediatricians on the identification and care of children with mental health problems has resulted from the recognition that: ‚Ä¢ Precursors of mental health disorders in adulthood can often be identified in early childhood (e.g. Anda et al., 2007) ‚Ä¢ At least 10% of children and adolescents have functional impairment due to a diagnosed mental health and/or substance abuse disorder (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (1999). Mental health: A Report of the Surgeon General. Washington, D.C: U.S. Government Printing Office.), and up to 25% have clinically significant problems that may not (yet) rise to the level of a diagnosable psychiatric disorder (Briggs-Gowan et al., 2003). ‚Ä¢ There is a shortage of qualified mental health clinicians, especially for children younger than 5, and for families in middle-and-low income groups and/or of minority background. ‚Ä¢ Primary care settings provide the most accessible and least stigmatizing resources for many families who have concerns about their children's developmental and/or behavior.\\"  Scope  According to the work of a recent task force commissioned by the Society of Pediatric Psychology, Division 54 of the American Psychological Association, 12 topic areas adapted from Roberts et al. (1998) were identified as important areas of expertise in pediatric psychology: # Lifespan development # Lifespan developmental psychopathology: the effects of one's disease and medical regimen on emotional, social, and behavioral development; additionally, normal developmental milestones may be used such that preventative efforts can be created and well-child visits can include a psychological-developmental perspective # Child, adolescent, and family assessment: experience with the assessment of health-related concerns such as health promotion, health risk, health outcome, and quality of life #Intervention strategies: Exposure to and experience with empirically supported interventions specifically applicable in pediatric psychology and delivered in health care settings #Research methods and systems evaluation: Exposure to research design issues especially pertinent to pediatric psychology such as health services research and clinical trials #Professional, ethical, and legal issues pertaining to children, adolescents, and families: knowledge and experience with issues such as health care delivery, practice of psychology in medical settings, and rights of caregivers vs. children when making decisions regarding medical care #Issues of diversity: Experience with patients from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as sexual orientations, in health care settings and understanding of nonmainstream health practices influenced by a family's cultural or religious beliefs #The role of multiple disciplines in service- delivering systems: Experience on multidisciplinary teams delivering health care services #Prevention, family support, and health promotion: understanding the principles of behavior change as they relate to healthy development, health-risk behavior, and prevention of disease in adulthood #Social issues affecting children, adolescents, and families: exposure to and experience with advocacy in pediatric health care including social issues that affect health care delivery #Consultant and liaison roles in health care settings: Exposure to different consultation-liaison models and supervised experience providing consultation #Disease process and medical management: A basic understanding of various diseases and their medical management. The field of pediatric psychology recognizes that pediatric conditions have emotional/psychological aspects, the presenting problems require integrated medical-psychological interventions, and traditional pediatric and/or clinical psychology could not meet the needs.  Future issues  Pediatric psychology is a growing field and several topics have been raised that need to be addressed within the field and were discussed in a Delphic Poll on the future of pediatric psychology: 1\\\\. Pediatric psychologists must demonstrate viability through empirical support for treatment interventions, which requires continued efforts to demonstrate improvements in pediatric outcomes (health, quality of life, psychological functioning, development) due to pediatric psychologists' efforts. This also requires evidence of medical cost offset, evidence of the efficacy of the integration of clinical research and practice, and evidence of the effectiveness of psychological interventions in decreasing societal costs related to pediatric conditions. 2\\\\. We must also increasingly integrate psychologist into the pediatric primary care setting by providing mental health services directly to patients in primary care settings, provide consultation and collaborative relationships with pediatricians and allied staff, and conduct clinically based research on primary care barriers in care. 3\\\\. Financial reimbursement policies need to be changed and the responsibility to makes these changes lies within several interacting disciplines‚Äîhealth policy-makers, health care institutions, and pediatric psychologists and their collaborators such as pediatricians. Several factors should be addressed, such as: creating non-DSM categories of reimbursable services, eliminating behavioral health carve-outs, payment for multidisciplinary team services, and developing service systems that recognize the complexity of problems in children and families. Currently, depending on the clinic and hospital that the psychologist is affiliated with, their services may or may not be covered by insurance or the institution's funds and reimbursement issues prevent pediatric psychologists from intervening in the most effective ways. Pediatric psychologists are trained in data analysis and research and so efforts should be made to demonstrate the benefits of pediatric psychologists and pediatricians collaborating such that the necessary reimbursements are instituted (http://www.nextgenmd.org/archives/808). Currently, research findings indicate that psychological interventions can decrease medical costs (Chiles, Lambert & Hatch, 1999Chiles, J. A., Lambert, M. J., & Hatch, A. L. (1999). The impact of psychological interventions on medical cost offset: A meta-analytic review.). Future research should also target patient satisfaction. 4\\\\. Collaboration between pediatricians and psychologists in clinical research and practice activities. 5\\\\. Emphasize importance of prevention of problems in childhood and promotion of optimal physical and mental health Here are a few examples concerning how pediatric psychologists have improved services: Primary Care Example: There are an increasing number of empirically supported interventions available for the treatment of common childhood problems appropriate to treat in the primary care setting (i.e. disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, non-adherence to medical treatments, etc.). For example, Lavigne and colleagues (2008) compared three interventions for Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in primary care. Pediatric practices (N = 24) were randomly assigned to receive (1) nurse-led or (2) psychologist-led group manualized parent training treatment, or (3) minimum intervention in which the treatment book was used. Sustained improvements occurred in all three conditions. However, there were better results for parents who attended more of the intervention sessions. This is evidence that primary care environments are an appropriate setting for delivering services. Prevention/Early Intervention Example: Pediatric psychologists can take a lead both in developing interventions and test their effectiveness in promoting vaccine acceptance and knowledge such that children are more likely to be vaccinated (Short, Rosenthal, Sturm, Zimet, 2009Short, M.B., Rosenthal, S.L., Sturm, L., & Zimet, G.D. (2009). Enhancing Adoption of Prevntive Behaviors: Vaccination as an Example. In M. C. Roberts, & Steele, R. C (Ed.), Handbook of pediatric psychology (Vol. 4th pp. 618‚Äì629). New York: Guilford.). For example, education-based tutorials created by pediatric psychologists to improve providers' knowledge of and comfort with addressing parents' concerns related to childhood immunizations is one promising approach that has been researched and found to be effective (i.e. Boom, Nelson, Laugman, Kohrt, & Kozinetz, 2007; Levi, 2006).  History of pediatric psychology  The \\"official\\" history of pediatric psychology dates to 1968 when the Society of Pediatric Psychology was established within the American Psychological Association. However, its origins date back to the early 1900s and Lightner Witmer. Often considered the father of clinical psychology, Witmer spent a good deal of his time working in tandem with physicians to improve children's behaviors. Considering the roughly 70 years between Witmer and the formation of the SPP, this merging of medicine and psychology was a slow progression. In 1911, the APA conducted a survey of medical schools regarding their view of psychology within medicine. While responses were favorable to the benefit of psychology in the medical school setting, there was no action to implement such teachings. This action started following the Second World War, when there was an increase in federal funding for clinical psychology and the employment of psychologists in medical schools. In fact, 80 percent of schools surveyed in 1951‚Äì1952 reported employing psychologists. However, it was thought that most were in psychiatric settings, not pediatric psychology positions Specific to pediatric psychology, in 1930, Anderson presented to the American Medical Association that he thought pediatrics and child psychology should work together on mutually important issues, but there was apparently limited response. The 1960s saw a growing number of pediatricians fielding questions regarding parent training. As a result, in 1964, the then president of the American Pediatric Society, Julius Richmond, suggested that pediatricians hire clinical psychologists to work with behavioral problems in children. The field was advanced when Kagan identified a number of areas the psychologist could be of help in the \\"new marriage\\" of pediatrics and psychology. He addressed psychologists' role in early identification of disorders and interventions. Much like a clinical-child psychologist, Kagan believed this role included a wide range of psychopathology. Wright, however, had a different idea of what a pediatric psychologists job should address. Narrower in scope, he suggested pediatric psychologists take a more behavioral approach and deal with issues of parent training, child development, and short-term therapy. With the public and professional momentum for pediatric psychology forged by Logan Wright, the APA formed a committee to determine whether a formal organization was needed. The committee, consisting of Logan Wright, Lee Salk, and Dorothea Ross, discovered a need would be filled, and at the annual APA convention in 1968, formed the \\"Society for Pediatric Psychology.\\" The following year, SPP was recognized as an affiliate of APA Division 12 (Clinical Psychology), Section 1 (Clinical Child Psychology) . At the inaugural SPP meeting in 1969, Logan Wright was elected the first president. Medical schools employing psychologists in pediatric settings were also on the rise. This increase in demand resulted in federal funding for the establishment of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 1962. Four years later it helped fund the first pediatric psychology training program at the University of Iowa. Over the next decade, SPP would consider sectionhood with several divisions (12, 37, 38) before officially becoming Section 5 of Division 12 in 1980. .\\" Here it would continue to grow until 2000 when it developed into Division 54 of the APA . By 1984, SPP had a solid foundation with growing membership and journal recognition. While pediatric psychologists work under the science-practitioner model, the trend at this time saw more practitioners. Employed predominantly in medical settings, there was immediate need for clinical application of skills to work with severe behavior problems. Kagan's vision of researcher in this setting would have to wait. Mesibov noted pediatric psychologists worked frequently with developmental disorders in children. Specifically, children with \\"mental retardation, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, autism, and related developmental problems. When not working directly with children, pediatric psychologists role included had a few other components. The demand and importance of parent training for children with developmental problems made it the subject of the SPP programming at the APA convention for 1983. The collaboration with other professionals on site (e.g., speech and language therapists) provided education in outside domains and in working as a member of an interdisciplinary team. Furthermore, pediatric psychologists helped to create programs in the community addressing children's needs. In 1988, then SPP president Walker presented recent survey findings to address current and future trends in the field regarding the areas of research, training, and clinical service. Psychologists surveyed were selected based on either serving on the Journal of Pediatric Psychology review board, or functioning as the director of a pediatric training program. Twenty-seven pediatric psychologists participated in the survey. The top three research trends ranked at the time included: chronic illness, prevention, and cost/benefit of interventions. Walker personally emphasized his concern with parenting practices with regard to prevention. In addressing children's emotional well-being, Walker stated prevention provides the best solution Clinical service trends ranked in order of importance for the future included: pediatric behavioral medicine, effective treatment protocols from common problems, and the role in medical setting. Walker attempted to assuage the contention surrounding the definition of pediatric psychologists role by teasing out the differences from clinical child psychology. Walker noted differences lie in conceptualization, intervention setting, and the intervention course of treatment, among others. While most pediatric psychologists were employed in medical schools and universities, Walker believed future trends would include more pediatric psychologists working as part of a multidisciplinary team in hospitals and health clinics. The final area of interest ranked training areas of importance for future pediatric psychologists. The top three included: brief treatment techniques, residency model, and biological and medical issues. At the time, pediatric psychology was considered a subspecialty within the field of clinical child psychology debating whether to branch out as its own field. In a brief article following his reception of the 1990 Distinguished Service Award from the SPP, Mesibov reflected on three unique, or \\"special\\" characteristics he identified within the field of pediatric psychology. Specifically, he applauded the field's practical application to tackle difficult human needs, multidisciplinary approach, and character of pediatric psychologists he has worked with throughout his career.  History of Journal and Newsletter  The development of SPP produced the need for formal communication among members in the field. Thanks to the work of Allan Barclay and Lee Salk, a newsletter was created. The Pediatric Psychology Newsletter, distributed quarterly, was launched in 1969, with Gail Gardner acting as first editor. However, due to SPP's limited funds in the early years, publication ceased from 1970 to 1972. With the help of growing membership and generous contributions from early members, the newsletter was restarted and saw continued growth from 1972 to 1975. The quality and volume of submissions to the newsletter resulted in the transition to the Journal of Pediatric Psychology (JPP) in 1976. The newsletter per se would not emerge again until 1980, under the leadership of Michael Roberts. The JPP began steady publication in 1973 under the appointment of Diane Willis as editor. A Professor of Psychology at University at Oklahoma and psychologist at the OU Child Study Center, she served as editor from 1973 to 1975, helping create the peer review system in place today, expanding content published, and seeing it go from Newsletter to Journal. In 1976, Don Routh began serving as Editor with Gary Mesibov serving as Associate Editor. He would serve two terms. Although still under financial uncertainty, several important events occurred during this time. In 1976, Psychological Abstracts recognized the JPP. This also marked the beginning of international subscriptions requested. The following year, APA gave JPP status as a division journal. The popularity of the Journal continued to grow. Common topics of the JPP included chronic pain and hyperactivity. The most important event, however, may be the successful contract negotiation with Plenum Publishing in 1979 which helped alleviate the ongoing financial concerns of the organization. The third editor of JPP, Gerald Koocher, served from 1983 to 1987. Michael Roberts became associate editor. The growth of JPP was evident as approximately 100 articles were submitted annually for publication. As a result, the Journal became more selective in its acceptance, at a rate of 29 percent. Furthermore, partnership with Plenum Publishing was renegotiated, and the Editorial Board expanding membership. Chronic illness continued to be topic \\"de jour,\\" but more applied research emerged. Michael Roberts served as editor from 1988 to 1992. Associate editors included Annette La Greca, Dennis Harper, and Jan Wallander. Under Roberts' leadership, JPP transitioned from a quarterly to bimonthly publication. While chronic pain remained the theme of most publications, more publications featured grant-funded research. Annette La Greca followed Roberts as editor, serving from 1993 to 1997. Associate editors across this span included Wallander, Dennis Drotar, Kathleen Lemanek, and later, Anne Kazak. The JPP continued its steady growth, and more papers were dedicated to special themes, explanatory and longitudinal in design, and nonintentional injuries. The submission rate grew and, as a result, only 16‚Äì18 percent submitted were published. Kazak took over as editor from 1998 to 2002. Associate editors included Lemanek, Christine Eiser, Antohony Spirito, Jack Finney, and Robert Thompson. The JPP finished its contract with Plenum Publishing at this time and decided to sign a new contract with Oxford University Press. Her term also saw the journal increase to 8 issues a year and provide online access to its members. Kazak was succeeded by Ron Brown, who served as Editor from 2003 to 2007. Drotar took taking over the editorial reins during 2008‚Äì2012 and Grayson Holmbeck served starting in 2013. Biopsychosocial model and health psychology In the past, most physicians followed the biomedical model which posited that all illness can be explained by improper functioning of the biological systems. By 1977, With the large leaps in medical science forced and changing views of health and illness doctors and psychologists to begin, alike, began to questioning their old methods of treating patients.Taylor, S. (2012). Health psychology. (8 ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages. This new method of thought is the biopsychosocial model and it was heavily influenced by two main issues: the specificity problem and the base rate problem. Specificity problem This problem address the fact one environmental stressor is often associated with many different disorders . An example of this would be work stress. Being stressed out at work can lead to hypertension; however, it can also lead to coronary heart disease. It is nearly impossible to tell which path will be taken as a result of the stress, and it could result in both. Base rate problem This problem states that it is very hard to predict whether the presence of a stressor will lead to the development of a disorder. The reason behind this is that experiencing the environmental stressor may lead to developing the disorder. However, diagnosing a patient on this alone would result in an absurd amount of false positives. An example of this would be smoking and cancer. If doctors were to diagnose everyone who ever smoked a cigarette or a cigar with cancer it would quickly become apparent that it is an ineffective diagnostic criterion because many individuals would not develop lung cancer. Holistic method The main premise of the biopsychosocial model is that you cannot separate the biological factors from the environmental factors when addressing an illness; you must view a person as part of a whole, or a system. The system theory is one of the best methods in which to observe this holistic model. The systems theory states that an individual exists within a hierarchy of subsystems (e.g. cells, person, family, society, etc.), and all of these subsystems interact. For example, if one were to lose a family member the individual may feel stressed which in turn may weaken his immune system and cause him or her to catch a cold. While the cold is considered biological in nature (i.e. a bacterium or a virus), it was aided by outside factors. This is a great example of how the biopsychosocial model approaches medical conditions. In order to effectively assess an illness one must identify and treat all contributing factors as well as the actual biological factors. This need to address physical, mental, and social needs (among many others) lead to health psychology, and from this the field of pediatric psychology.  Origins  World War II gave way to a rise in the amount of psychologists that worked in medical schools. The pediatric population doctors worked with had a variety of problems in addition to their illnessDoctors had children as patients with a variety of problems (e.g., developmental, behavioral, academic). Patients needs, and their families, were not receiving adequate attention from psychology clinics at the time.Aylward, B. S., Bender, J. A., Graves, M. M., & Roberts, M.C. (2009). Historical developments and trends in pediatric psychology. In M.C. Roberts & R.G. Steele (Eds.), Handbook of pediatric psychology (4th ed pp. 3‚Äì18). New York: Guilford Press. To meet the needs of pediatric patients Jerome Kagan requested a \\"new marriage\\" between psychology and pediatrics, stressing early detection of psychopathology and psychosocial problems. Understanding prenatal- and perinatal factors relating to psychological problems was also emphasized. The term \\"pediatric psychology\\" was first used in 1967 by Logan Wright in the article \\"The Pediatric Psychologist: A Role Model,\\" and was defined as \\"dealing primarily with children in a medical setting which is nonpsychiatric in nature\\". Wright emphasized the importance of: * group identity for the pediatric psychology field (formal organization, distributing newsletter) * specifications for training future pediatric psychologists * body of knowledge accumulated by means of applied research  Organizational developments  Pediatric psychologists established a group identity with the Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP). SPP was initially an interest group in the Clinical Child Psychology division of the APA. As membership elevated, SPP was recognized by the APA as a group whose purpose was to \\"exchange information on clinical procedures and research, and to define training standards for the pediatric psychologist\\". With this new-found recognition, division 54 of the APA was created. Some of the main goals of this organization are to promote the unique research and clinical contributions from pediatric psychology. The Journal of Pediatric Psychology was founded in 1976, and it has helped to further the professional recognition of the field. It allowed for clinicians, teachers, and researchers alike to exchange ideas and new discoveries. It is a respected scholarly journal which aims to increase the knowledge regarding children who suffer from acute and chronic illness, and attempt to identify and resolve the contributing factors in order to yield optimal outcomes.  Society of Pediatric Psychology Special Interest Groups The Pediatric Psychology APA Division 54 formed Special Interests Groups (SIGs) and they consist of the following: Adherence Special Interest Group, Consultation and Liaison Special Interest Group, Craniofacial Special Interest Group, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Special Interest Group, Diversity Special Interest Group, Epilepsy Special Interest Group, Obesity Special Interest Group, Pediatric Bioethics Special Interest Group, Pediatric Cardiology Special Interest Group, Pediatric Gastroenterology Special Interest Group. The mission of the SIG groups are to promote evidence- based approaches to research and clinical service targeting the specific interest. Adherence Special Interest Group The Adherence Special Interest Group promotes evidence-based approaches to research and clinical service targeting the assessment and treatment of regimen adherence concerns in youth and families across a variety of chronic health conditions.Special Interest Groups. Retrieved April 15, 2012, from http://www.apadivisions.org/division-54/sigs/index.aspx/ The World Health Organization (2003) World Health Organization (2003). Adherence to Long-term Therapies: Evidence for action. Geneva, Switzerland. has labeled poor adherence to prescription medications and treatment a \\"worldwide problem of striking magnitude\\". Adherence according to the WHO (2003) is defined as \\"the extent to which a person's behavior‚Äîtaking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider\\" (Haynes, 1979;Haynes, R.B. (1979). Determinants of compliance: The disease and the mechanics of treatment. Baltimore MD, Johns Hopkins University Press. Rand, 1993 ). Non-adherence influences health care utilization and costs, morbidity, and health outcomes (Drotar, 2000Drotar, D. (2000). Promoting adherence to medical treatment in childhood chronic illness: Concepts, methods, and interventions. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.). Potentially effective treatments become ineffective by non- adherence and clinical benefits are not received. For example, up to 20% of patients fail to fill new prescriptions and 50% of people with chronic health conditions discontinue their medication within six months. Adherence to behavioral treatments is also poor. For example, no more than 30% of patients quit smoking at their provider's request, even those with lung conditions. At the same rate, the leading causes of death (Heart disease, cancer, stroke and chronic lower respiratory diseases- see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm) contain behavioral related causes and treatments. Therefore, adherence is a lifelong, mortality risk. Additionally, higher rates of adherence result in economic benefits. For example, direct savings may be accrued by reduced use of expensive and sophisticated health services needed in cases of crises, relapse, and worsening disease outcomes due to non-adherence. Research suggests that when self-management and adherence program are combined with regular treatment, there is an increase in health-promoting behaviors and a cost to savings ratio of approximately 1:10 in some cases and results persisted over 3 years (see Holman et al., 1997; Tuldra et al., 2000 Access to medical care is vitally important, but if people do not comply with their professional recommendations, then mere access will not lead to better health outcomes. Thus, generating innovative methods to enhance childhood adherence has become increasingly more important because effective preventive efforts must begin at an early age, starting with healthy lifestyle behaviors and increased adherence. For example, \\"a pediatric psychologist may work with a young child who has cystic fibrosis and who refuses to complete all his daily medical treatments that are essential to his health. The psychologist might work with the child's caregivers on how to interact with the child when he refuses his medical treatments and how to implement a reward system to reinforce his adherence to treatments.\\" http://www.nextgenmd.org/archives/808. Also, challenging family interaction styles can play a role in adherence. In particular, families with divorced parents may struggle with communication concerning a child's illness and treatment. Pediatric psychologists may intervene by working with the parents to find a way to communicate more effective so that barriers to adherence are removed. Craniofacial Special Interest Group The Craniofacial special interest groups consists of members of the Society of Pediatric Psychology who share an interest in craniofacial conditions. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Special Interest Group The Complementary and Integrative Medicine special interest group is a forum for communication and discussion about the role of CIM as it relates to advancing the health and well-being of pediatric populations. Consultation and Liaison Special Interest Group The mission of the Consultation and Liaison Special Interest Group is to promote discussion, education, research, and networking among pediatric psychologists who provided consultation and liaison services to pediatric patients and their families.Consultation and Liaison Special Interest Group. Retrieved April 15, 2012, from http://www.apadivisions.org/division-54/sigs/consultation/index.aspx/ Pediatric Consultation-Liaison is a subspecialty practice of pediatric psychology and represents the most active collaboration between pediatricians and pediatric psychologists.Olson, R., Mullins, L., Chaney, J. M. & Gillman, J. B. (1994). The role of the pediatric psychologist in a consultation-liaison service, In R. A. Olson, L. L. Mullins, J. B. Gillman, & J. M. Chaney (Eds.), The sourcebook of pediatric psychology (pp. 1‚Äì8), Needham Heights, MA.: Allyn and Bacon According to the 2003 Society of Pediatric Psychology Task Force Report: Recommendations for the Training of Pediatric Psychologists, consultation-liaison roles are one of the types of experience most important to developing competencies in pediatric psychology. Pediatric psychologists often consult with pediatricians and providers from other disciplines in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings.Drotar, D. (1995). Consulting with pediatricians: Psychological perspectives. New York: Plentum. They have a working understanding of various consultation models and often consult with and educate patients, their families, physicians, other health-care providers school psychologists, counselors, teachers, and other professionals regarding pediatric illness and accompanying psychosocial issues. Pediatric psychologists also act as liaisons with medical subspecialties and provide support to other professionals for issues related to the management of difficult families, stressful physician and family interactions, professional burnout, bereavement, and negotiating stressful situations. =Consultation- Liaison Models= Consultation vs. Liaison Emphasis Often considered synonymous, the terms \\"consultation\\" and \\"liaison\\" have important distinctions. While many psychologists provide both services, pediatric psychologists acting in a consultant role are directly involved in patient care only at the request of a referring physician or service. In a consultation arrangement, the relationship between the consultant and physicians is often time-limited‚Äîwhen consultation services are terminated, the relationship often ends. Pediatric psychologists in a liaison role are often involved in the day-to-day workings of a particular hospital service or unit and are formally embedded within a department or working service. Psychologists in a liaison role are often involved in all of the systemic and mental health concerns of the unit, not just the concerns of referred patients.Strain, J. S. (2002). Consultation psychiatry. In M. G. Wise & J. R. Rundell (Eds.), The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of consultation- liaison psychiatry: Psychiatry in the medically ill (pp. 123‚Äì150). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing. Patient-Centered vs. Systems- Centered Focus Consultation-liaison models are sometimes differentiated based on whether the focus of the services are primarily on the patient (\\"patient-centered\\") or on the larger system the patient and family must rely on for medical care (\\"systems-centered\\"). In patient-centered services, the primary goal is to evaluate the patient in order to provide direct treatment. In systems-centered services, the focus of the services are on creating change in the professionals requesting the services to make them more effective in the intervention with the case in question, as well as in other similar cases. =Inpatient Pediatric Consultation-Liaison= As an inpatient pediatric consultation‚Äîliaison, the pediatric psychologist advises physicians or other medical professionals or provides direct services to medically hospitalized children regarding behavioral, emotional, or familial aspects of the child's illness and symptoms.Drotar, D., Spirito, A., & Stancin, T. (2003) Professional roles and practice patterns. In M. C. Roberts (Ed.), Handbook of pediatric psychology (3rd ed., pp. 50‚Äì66). New York: Guilford. The consultation-liaison psychologist's primary role includes evaluating children and their families for mental health concerns; recommending and providing treatments; and educating families, staff, and referring physicians on a wide array of factors associated with adjustment to medical illness and injury. Patient interventions include teaching coping skills, evaluating side effects of medication, helping manage physical pain, and addressing physical pain, among others. Defined narrowly, inpatient pediatric consultation-liaison involves a pediatric psychologist providing assessment and guidance to a pediatrician colleague regarding the care of a specific patient. Broadly defined, the pediatric consultation-liaison psychologist is a systems-level catalyst‚Äîin educating and empowering multiple interacting components of the health care system, fostering a responsive environment that maximizes the overall quality of life and psychological adjustment of patients and their families.Carter, B. D., Kronenberger, W. G., Scott, E., & Ernst, M. M. (2009) Inpatient Pediatric Consultation‚ÄîLiaison. In M.C. Roberts & R. G. Steele (Eds.) Handbook of pediatric psychology (4th ed., pp. 114‚Äì129). Research on inpatient pediatric consultation-liaison services There are few studies illustrating the breadth of services provided by pediatric consultation-liaison psychologists. In a survey of 144 children's hospital- based child psychiatry consultation-liaison services, Shaw and colleagues reported that returned surveys (33%) indicated that the most common referral concerns for consultation-liaison services included patient depression, anxiety, suicide risk assessment, and medication evaluation. In the only case- controlled study of pediatric consultation-liaison services, Carter and colleagues (2003) matched 104 referrals with controls for age, gender, and illness type or severity and completed parent- and self-report behavioral rating scales to assess for adjustment. Nurses completed in-hospital ratings of behavioral or adjustment difficulties. Goal attainment and satisfaction ratings were obtained from referring physicians, parents, and the consultant. Results indicated that referrals exhibited more behavior, adjustment, or coping difficulties than nonreferrals by parent-, nurse- and self-report. Referring physician and consultant ratings of goal attainment were high, as were physician ratings of satisfaction and parent or guardian ratings of overall helpfulness of the consultation-liaison services. Referral sources included equal distributions from hematology/oncology, surgery/trauma, pulmonology, and other sources. Reasons for referral included assisting children in coping with physical illness/injury, improving treatment adherence, assessing and treating depression and anxiety, teaching pain management techniques, assisting with parent coping, helping with adjustment to medical diagnoses, and resolving family conflicts. In a review of clinical reports and treatment outcome studies on pediatric consultation-liaison services, Knapp and Harris surveyed illness-specific and general investigations into the psychiatric care of children with medical illnesses. They concluded that pediatric consultation‚Äìliaison services are playing an increasing role in addressing the emotional and behavioral needs of pediatric inpatients by helping patients and their families adapt to stressors associated with chronic illness. Olson and colleagues reviewed the records of 749 inpatient referrals seen by pediatric psychologists at Oklahoma Children's Hospital over a 5-year period. In order of greatest frequency, referrals were for depression or suicide attempt, adjustment problems to chronic illness, and behavior problems. Consultations were most frequently requested by general pediatrics followed by surgery and adolescent medicine. Nearly a third of the referrals were also seen for outpatient follow-up. Health care providers making referrals were generally very satisfied with the services of the pediatric consultation-liaison team and reported a high likelihood of making future referrals. In another study, Rodrigue and colleagues reviewed 1,467 records of referrals (448 inpatient, 1,019 outpatient) to a health sciences center-based pediatric psychology service at the University of Florida Health Sciences Center. The majority of inpatient referrals were from general pediatrics (40%), pediatric hematology or oncology (31%), adolescent psychiatry (15%), pediatric intensive care (5%), and the burn unit (4%). The most common reason for referral (inpatient and outpatient) was assessment of cognitive or neuropsychological functioning. Next were externalizing behavior problems, comprehensive psychological evaluation, pre-surgery or transplant evaluation, and adjustment problems to chronic illness. They also reported that retrospective survey results suggested high overall satisfaction with service quality. In an early study of referral problems for pediatric consultation-liaison services, Drotar reported that referral questions included evaluation of developmental delay, adaptation and adjustment to chronic illness or physical disability, concerns regarding the psychological factors in physical symptom presentation, behavior problems, and managing psychological crises. Five C's of pediatric consultation-liaison services Using an alliterative pneumonic device called the \\"Five C's of Consultation: Crisis, Coping, Compliance (Adherence), Communication and Collaboration,\\" Carter and von WeissCarter, B. D., & von Weiss, R. (2005). Pediatric consultation‚Äîliaison: Applied child health psychology. In R. Steele & M. Roberts (Eds.), Handbook of mental health services for children and adolescents (pp. 63‚Äì77). New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press. characterize the activities of pediatric-liaison services according to overlapping arenas of intervention and practice under which the majority of referrals can be categorized. Crisis Following diagnosis of a potentially serious illness or injury, patients and their families are often in a state of shock and disbelief. At this time, the details and decisions of medical evaluation and treatment may be overwhelming and bewildering.Drotar, D., & Zagorski, L. (2001). Providing psychological services in pediatric settings in an era of managed care. In J. N. Hughes, A. M. La Greca, & J. C. Conoley (Eds.), Handbook of psychological services for children and adolescents (pp. 89‚Äì104). New York: Oxford. Very focused interventions are often needed to help them achieve some sense of basic understanding and control of the situation. Consultation-liaison skills that enable psychologists to act in crisis situations include crisis intervention, needs assessment, providing direction, mobilization of social supports, identifying areas for parental or child control, and interpreting and reframing child or family reactions to staff. A medical crisis counseling model that lends itself particularly well to pediatric crisis situations has been developed by Pollin.Pollin, I. (1994). Taking charge: Overcoming the challenges of long-term illness. New York: NortonPollin, I. (1995). Medical crisis counseling: Short-term therapy for long-term illness. New York: Norton. In this model, the consultant focuses on the patient's medical condition, and directs interventions toward normalizing the patient's and the family's state of emotional distress while helping the patient and family identify concrete actions they can take in order to cope successfully. Coping Children are exposed to many stressors associated with acute and chronic illness and injury during the course of evaluation and treatment.Harbeck-Weber, C., Fisher, J. LO., & Dittner, C. A. (2003). Promoting coping and enhancing adaptation to illness. In M. C. Roberts (Ed.), Handbook of pediatric psychology 3rd ed., pp. 99‚Äì118). New York: Guilford. Acute stressors include short and lengthy medical procedures such as venipunctures, injections, hospitalizations, surgeries and chemotherapy, among others. Other stressors accompanying chronic illnesses may impact the child and family for months, years, or even a lifetime, often with an uncertain prognosis. Pediatric consultation-liaison psychologists need to be aware of individual and developmental factors when designing interventions to help children adapt to the stressors of illness or injury and treatment; for example, limited linguistic and cognitive abilities limit the knowledge and understanding of health concepts of younger children, thus limiting their ability to use internal coping resources and reach out to external supports when compared to older children or adolescents.Harbeck-Weber, C., & Peterson, L. (1993). Children's conception of illness and pain. In R. Vasta (Ed.), Annals of child development (pp. 133‚Äì163). Bristol, PA: Jessica Kingsley. Children's coping styles also differ; for example, some children attempt to gather information and familiarize themselves with upcoming procedures, whereas others avoid discussing stressors and refuse to look at or distract themselves from stressful stimuli. Differences in coping styles have been shown to be associated with the child's adaptation to surgery and hospitalization, lower physiological stress response, and child cooperation pre- and post-surgery. There is evidence suggesting that primary control, strategies whereby a child modifies the objective situation, are most effective when employed to cope with stressors over which the child has control, whereas secondary control strategies, strategies involving the child modifying emotional and behavioral reactions to the stressor, are most effective with uncontrollable stressors.Compas, B., Malcarne, V., & Banez, G. (1992). Coping with psychological stress: a developmental perspective. In B. Carpenter (Ed.), Personal coping: Theory, research and application (pp. 47‚Äì64). Westport, CT: Praeger. Interventions to facilitate child and family coping often begin with providing basic information and education about their illness and treatment procedures, often using videotaped or in vivo models to demonstrate the use of positive coping strategies and teach mastery skills. Other coping interventions include cognitive-behavioral and strength-building interventions, operant reward programs, integrating parent participation, evaluation and mobilization of family and social supports, assisting patient and family in understanding and navigating the medical system, directive and expressive medical play therapy, pain and anxiety management skills training, sensitizing medical staff to patient needs and perceptions, and psychopharmacological interventions. Compliance (Adherence) Adherence to medical treatment regimens is a major pediatric health concern,La Greca, A. M., & Bearman, K. J. (2003). Adherence to pediatric treatment regimens. In M. C. Robers (Ed.). Handbook of pediatric psychology 3rd ed., pp. 99‚Äì118). New York: Guilford with estimates on nonadherence as high as 50% or higher.Rapoff, M. A. (1999). Adherence to pediatric medical regimens. New York: Kluwer/Academic. Children's adherence to their medical regimens is heavily influenced by developmental, as well as family factors. Medical management of chronic and serious pediatric illness often requires stressful role relationship changes within the family that require redistribution of time and redefinition of responsibilities. The impact of these changes can be far reaching, affecting such factors as marital satisfaction and parent adjustment. Nonadherance to prescribed medical regimens can be the result of variety of factors including lack of education and training in the regimen, difficulty in understanding the procedures, fearfulness and anxiety, interference of the treatment with normal activities, and parent or child dynamics, among others. Nonadherence or poor adherence to medical regimens may adversely affect the health of the pediatric patient, resulting in hospitalization to address disease processes and adherence issues. Nonadherence issues include failure to administer medications as prescribed, failure to follow dietary guidelines, defiance of physical activity restrictions, and uncooperativeness with medical procedures. Several methods might be employed the help patients and their families monitor adherence, including direct observations of the patient's behavior; assays of blood, urine, or saliva; self-report, health care provider ratings, pill counts, and a variety of monitoring devices, for example, blood glucose meters. Interventions that can be sued to facilitate patient and family adherence in the inpatient pediatric setting include providing information and education, teaching mastery skills, behavioral management contracting, removing barriers, monitoring and charting performance of medical treatment components, addressing family or health care system dynamics, normalizing or reframing the patient's condition, altering patient or family lifestyle behaviors, altering expectations of family or health care providers to coincide with realistic developmental needs, negotiation and compromise. Communication Pediatric consultation-liaison psychologists often deal with situations wherein medical staff members have made a referral due to behavioral difficulties with the child or their family that are disruptive to the functioning of the hospital unit. Often overwhelmed, bewildered, and at the point of significant frustration and defensiveness, the patient and their family are frequently unaware of the referral, which places the consultant in a potentially volatile situation. Strong diplomatic and communication skills, as well as sensitivity to patient, family, and hospital staff issues, are required in such situationsBrown, R. T., & Macias, m. (2001). Chronically ill children and adolescents. In J. N. Hughes, A. M. La Greca, & J. C. Conoley (Eds.), Handbook of psychological services for children and adolescents (pp. 353‚Äì372). New York: Oxford. By arranging and coordinating staffings on difficult and complex cases, maintaining a regular presence at service rounds and team meetings, fostering ongoing collaborative relationships with hospital staff, promoting ever increasing cultural sensitivity, and respectfully listening to and reframing patient or family and staff behaviors to facilitate understanding across all parties involved, the pediatric consultation-liaison psychologist can do much to defuse potentially volatile situations. Collaboration Carter and von Weiss suggest that while Collaboration is listed one of the five C's, it cannot be emphasized enough because it underlies the potential successfulness of practice in the other four. The relationship between the pediatric psychologist and the referring services has evolved out of shared goals in the areas of research, teaching, and service. Close collaborative relationships have the potential of having a critical impact on the clinical care of patients and their families. Diversity Special Interest Group The Diversity Special Interest Group is committed to promoting diversity in pediatric psychology research and clinical care, to increasing the number of Society of Pediatric Psychology members from diverse backgrounds, and to providing services and resources for members who are from underrepresented groups. Epilepsy Special Interest Group The Epilepsy Special Interest Group's goals are to increase awareness of epilepsy among Society of Pediatric Psychology members, foster communication between and support for pediatric psychologists, and liaison with the American Epilepsy Society. Obesity Special Interest Group The Obesity Special Interest Group provides education, training and mentoring of psychologists in the care of overweight/obese youth and advocacy for public policy. Pediatric Bioethics Special Interest Group The Pediatric Bioethics Special Interest Group provides a forum to discuss challenges, share ideas and resources, and pursue collaborative relationships with a community of other pediatric psychologists. Pediatric Cardiology Special Interest Group The Pediatric Cardiology special interest group promotes the discussion of issues faced by pediatric psychologists who work with children who have congenital heart disease, cardiac transplant, or other cardiac conditions. Pediatric Gastroenterology Special Interest Group The mission of this Pediatric Gastroenterology Special Interest Group is to facilitate the study and discussion of psychosocial aspects of pediatric gastroenterological conditions; develop collaborative relationships among practitioners who carry out psychological interventions with pediatric GI populations, and educate clinical professionals about the psychosocial issues which may affect the child or adolescent with a gastroenterological condition. Pediatric Pain Special Interest Group Pediatric pain is a common condition of childhood/adolescence. As such, many pediatric psychologists research and provide clinical care in this area and specialized programs are developing. The Pediatric Pain Special Interest Group provides a forum for communication and discussion about the many developments in the field. Modern training The road to becoming a pediatric psychologist is long and consists of many years of training. Most clinicians have a strong background in psychology coming out of their undergraduate schooling. It is ideal for prospective students to take courses in developmental psychology, health psychology, developmental psychopathology, abnormal psychology, and many others. In order to be competitive when applying to graduate schools, most students will have a strong background in research either as an assistant in a pediatric psychology lab, conducting independent studies, or both. Student's may also find it beneficial to acquire field experience with children in order to demonstrate that they can become adept clinicians. In addition to this, for admission to graduate school, it is necessary to have a relationship with three or more psychologists in order to provide letters of recommendation. To become a full- fledged pediatric psychologist one must obtain a doctoral degree in the form of either a Ph.D. or Psy.D. in clinical or counseling psychology. Graduate training typically requires 4‚Äì5 years of graduate school and an additional year spent on an internship. Some programs will require the completion of a master's thesis while others will not. All, however, will require that students complete a dissertation consisting of original research. A doctoral program will use the scientist practitioner or Boulder model which emphasizes training in both clinical practice and research methodology, while a PsyD program will likely use the Vail model which emphasizes clinical skills much more than research. Some schools will provide a specialization in child clinical psychology or health psychology which can supplement normal training with a pediatric twist.Hommel, K.A. Commentary on training in pediatric psychology. Unpublished manuscript, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. Another aspect of graduate training is external practicums in settings such hospitals or clinics. Gaining experience working in these areas is essential in order to be prepared to obtain a job after graduate school. In order to help standardize the training each psychologist receives, the Society of Pediatric Psychology task force developed a list of 12 training areas necessary for a specialty in pediatric psychology: # Lifespan development # Lifespan developmental psychopathology # Child, adolescent, and family assessment # Intervention strategies # Research methods and systems evaluation # Professional, ethical, and legal issues pertaining to children, adolescents, and families # Diversity issues and multicultural competence # Role of multiple disciplines in service delivery systems # Prevention, family support, and health promotion # Social issues affecting children, adolescents, and families # Consultation-liaison (CL) roles # Disease process and medical management After graduate school, there are many choices in order to determine the field best suited to one's interests. Some individuals will engage in a fellowship which will allow for increased knowledge in specific areas of clinical psychology and research and may yield more job opportunities. A postdoctoral fellowship may also provide supervised clinical hours which are required in order to become independently licensed in a state. Finally, some pediatric psychologists will go on to engage in clinical practice while others will not. In order to practice as a clinical psychologist one must obtain a doctoral degree from an approved program, complete a required amount of supervised clinical hours, pass the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP), and be knowledgeable of all state regulations. Pediatric Psychologists may choose to become certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) and can apply for advanced credentials through the American Board of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (ABCCAP) or the American Board of Clinical Health Psychology (ABCHP). Research The main goal of pediatric research is to understand child development occurring with health-related issues. Using ecological systems framework, pediatric psychologists discover the ways in which health issues might affect children and their families and ways to promote physical health and psychological adjustment in pediatric-health populations.

More children and adolescents die as a result of an unintentional injury than from all other childhood diseases combined.National Centers for Injury Prevention and Control. (2008). WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System). Retrieved July 14, 2008, from www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars. Health care providers have multiple opportunities to provide prevention materials and injury guidance. Simon et al. (2006) found that less frequent injury guidance results in more frequent medically linked injuries by 16 months of age. Research suggests that counseling increases parental safety behaviors and counseling tailored to risk behaviors of a particular family are most effective. Pediatric psychology has a significant role to play in formulating, implementing, and evaluating injury prevention efforts.  Future research directions  Positive, resilience factors, and quality of life: Pediatric psychologists are increasingly understanding and applying research on resilience factors and protective factors. Researchers have discovered that despite psychological risk factors associated with childhood chronic illnesses, the majority of children with chronic illnesses fare just as well as their peers or even better in some cases.Barakat, L.P., Pulgaron, E.R., Daniel, L.C. (2009). Positive Psychology in Pediatric Psychology. In M. C. Roberts, & Steele, R. C (Ed.), Handbook of pediatric psychology (Vol. 4th pp. 763‚Äì773). New York: Guilford. Furthermore, the study of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is unique to the pediatric setting and encompasses domains of physical, psychological, and social functioning that are directly influenced by chronic illnesses. Researchers have found that pediatric cancer survivors typically report positive outcomes, while lower levels were reported in children and teens with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and asthma, which may be due in part to the intensity and duration of the treatments. Researchers' current goal is to identify areas of functioning that are relatively untouched from the illness and treatment and to focus in on the domains of the HRQOL for which there is an increased risk so that prevention and intervention efforts can target the most valuable domains.

According to the company's website, its goal is to \\"bring the authentic Quebec classic to the rest of the World.\\" History Ryan Smolkin, the founder of Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie, worked alongside Toronto restaurant consultants The Fifteen Group when starting out, in order to gain experience in the restaurant industry. Alongside the help of The Fifteen Group‚Äôs chef, the original gravy recipe was developed. In Toronto in 2008, its premiere location was the first poutine-exclusive restaurant ('poutinerie') in that city. Smolkin was inspired by Montreal restaurant La Banquise, which serves many different kinds of poutine. Smolkin frequents La Banquise whenever he visits Montreal. By 2017, the restaurant had some 150 locations across Canada in Toronto, Hamilton, St. Catharines, Oshawa, London, Guelph, Winnipeg, Kingston, Ottawa, Waterloo, Windsor, Mont-Tremblant, Saskatoon, Regina, Fredericton, Halifax, Calgary, Moose Jaw, Kelowna, Vancouver and St. John‚Äôs and with new franchises in the works in Kingston, Barrie, Edmonton and Whistler.http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/meet-ryan-smolkin-torontos- king-poutine-1034804 In December 2014, Smoke's opened a location in Berkeley, California, its first in the United States. In 2015, the franchise's owners stated that they planned to expand the company internationally and would \\"open 1,300 restaurants around the world by 2020 devoted mainly to fans of poutine.\\" In 2016, Smoke's Poutinerie owned 76 restaurants in Canada and 5 in the United States.  Poutine Eating Championship  The Annual Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie World Poutine Eating Championship crowns a new champion each year, and in 2016 a world record was broken for poutine eating. The event includes 3 levels of poutine eating including amateur, professional, and Destroyer. Throughout the day Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie provides free poutine all day from 10am-4pm, musical entertainment, games, prizes, and giveaways. In 2016, the event focused on raising money for the Friends of We Care charity and raised over $50,000 to send disabled children to camp.  Competition  Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie has experienced increasing competition from other Canadian poutinerie chains over the years including Poutini‚Äôs House of Poutine which opened its second location in Toronto, ON in 2015, and Poutineville which as of May 2019, has 6 restaurants in Quebec. Further competition has come from corporate businesses. In 2013, McDonald's expanded its poutine product from being only in Quebec, Canada, to the entire country of Canada. In 2012, Wendy‚Äôs added poutine to their menu as Canada‚Äôs national dish. Since McDonald's and Wendy‚Äôs, more companies have added poutine to their menus including Burger King, A&W;, KFC, Popeyes and New York Fries to name a few.  Expansion  Smolkin's marketing campaign focuses on \\"word of mouth and publicity stunts instead of traditional advertising. Having some 200 locations in North America already, by 2020 Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie plans to open 1300 restaurants, 800 in the US, and hundreds more across Western Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and in the Asia- Pacific region.http://globalnews.ca/news/3461564/how-to-make-the-perfect- poutine-the-quintessential-canadian-dish/ Using master franchise or license agreements, the plan is to expand over 150 stores internationally starting with the Middle East and the U.K. In the US, they will offer multi-unit agreements. Smoke‚Äôs Poutinerie has already started on this development by having sold locations to American franchisees.

Life Born in Dorset about 1556, he matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, on 20 December 1577. The Principal, Philip Randall, was a Catholic sympathiser, and under his influence Warmington openly espoused Catholicism. He left Oxford, and studied philosophy and theology at Douai. After a brief visit to England in 1579, he was ordained sub-deacon at Douai on 24 February 1580, deacon on 19 March, and priest on 25 May. He was again sent to England on 31 January 1581, was apprehended, and in February 1585 transported to Normandy with threats of more severe treatment if he returned. He was appointed chaplain to Cardinal William Allen. After Allen's death in 1594 he returned to England as an oblate of the Congregation of St. Ambrose. On 24 March 1608, he was apprehended by two pursuivants, and imprisoned in The Clink in Southwark.‚Äô There he decided to take the oath of allegiance to James I. Set at liberty on swearing, Warmington found himself deserted by former friends, and petitioned James I for an allowance.

In a career that lasted from 1885 to 1888 he ran twelve times and won nine races. He was the leading British two-year-old of 1885 and went on to win the Grand Prix de Paris in June 1886. His career was often overshadowed by that of his contemporary Ormonde who defeated him on both of the occasions they met on the racecourse. Background Minting was a ‚Äúgigantic‚Äù bay horse standing just over 16 hands high, bred by the Duke of St. Albans. He was later acquired by Robert Charles de Grey Vyner and sent into training with Mathew Dawson at Heath House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Minting‚Äôs sire Lord Lyon, who died in 1887, was an outstanding racehorse who won the English Triple Crown in 1866. He was not a great success as a stallion: apart from Minting his only notable offspring was the filly Placida, who won The Oaks in 1877. Indeed, Lord Lyon had been almost forgotten before the arrival of Minting. Minting was one of three Classic winners produced by the mare Mint Sauce. She had already foaled The Lambkin who won the St Leger in 1884 and went on to produce the 1000 Guineas winner Minthe. Apart from the obvious reference to his dam, Minting's name also refers to the Lincolnshire village, near which his owner kept a residence called Minting Lodge. Racing career 1885: two-year-old season Minting made his debut at Newcastle, where he won the ¬£470 Seaton Delaval Stakes. At Goodwood in July Minting won the Prince of Wales‚Äôs Stakes in impressive fashion, causing a writer for Bell's Life to predict that he could become one of the best horses ‚Äúwithin men‚Äôs memory.‚Äù In the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster on 15 September he started at odds of 20/55 against five opponents. Ridden by Fred Archer, he took the lead and won very easily by one and a half lengths from Gay Hermit. At Newmarket in October he won a three runner race for the Triennial Produce Stakes and was then sent to contest the Middle Park Plate, at that time the most prestigious two-year-old race of the season. He started at odds of 4/7 with Saraband being regarded as his most serious rival. Minting appeared to be unsuited by the heavy ground, but was driven out to win by a neck from Braw Lass, with Saraband third. Following this victory he ended his first season unbeaten in five races and was quoted at odds of 4/1 for the following year‚Äôs Derby. With the other unbeaten colts Ormonde and The Bard in contention the crop of three-year-old for the following season looked to be the strongest for many years. 1886: three- year-old season Mathew Dawson, Minting's trainer In early 1886 the betting for the Classics was dominated by Minting and the also undefeated Ormonde, In March Minting was 2/1 favourite for the 2000 Guineas with Ormonde on 5/2, while the colts were 11/2 joint favourites for the Derby. On 28 April Minting started the 11/10 the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. The race was run at an exceptionally strong pace and Minting, ridden by John Watts, tracked the leaders in the early stages before moving up to dispute the lead with Ormonde just after half way. Minting went a neck in front as the two colts drew away from the rest of the field, but Ormonde‚Äôs superiority became evident as he pulled away in the closing stages to win by two lengths. There was a gap of ten lengths back to Mephisto in third. Rather than take on Ormonde again in the Derby, Minting‚Äôs connections opted to wait for the Grand Prix de Paris on 6 June. This race, run over 3000m at Longchamp, was the most valuable and important race in France. Minting started at odds of 4/6 in a field which included The Oaks winner Miss Jummy and the French colts Sycamore and Upas, who had dead-heated for the Prix du Jockey Club. Ridden by Archer, Minting was held up at the back of the field in the early stages as the outsider Polyeucte opened up a big lead. 400m from the finish, as other runners began to struggle on the heavy ground, Minting began to make rapid progress, catching Polyeucte in the closing stages and winning by two lengths ‚Äúwithout the semblance of an effort.‚Äù His win was enthusiastically received by the British contingent in the crowd. According to one report, Minting‚Äôs win was so easy that Archer had been able to pull him up to a walk at the line. Minting had been strongly fancied since the start of the season for the inaugural running of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July but on the eve of the race he sustained a tendon injury in exercise, which ruled him out of the event. The injury provoked such ‚Äúsinister rumours‚Äù that Minting‚Äôs connections published the colt‚Äôs veterinary notes to prove their version of events. In fact the injury was so serious that Minting was unable to run again that year. 1887: four-year-old season Minting returned on 7 June at Royal Ascot when he ran in the Jubilee Handicap over one mile. Ridden by the veteran John Osborne, he won easily from St Mirin, who was receiving twelve pounds, with the Eclipse Stakes winner Bendigo finishing a remote third. This performance, together with Ormonde‚Äôs worsening wind trouble (he had become a roarer), made the second meeting between the two colts in the Hardwicke Stakes three days later a much-anticipated one. Minting, starting 7/4 second favourite, took the lead and set a strong pace with the hope of exposing any weaknesses in the favourites breathing. He turned back several challengers before Ormonde moved up alongside him in the straight. A ‚Äúmagnificent race‚Äù ensued, in which Minting was beaten a neck amid scenes of the wildest excitement. 1888: five-year-old season On his five-year-old debut, Minting ran in the Great Jubilee Handicap over one mile at Kempton. He won the race by three lengths ‚Äúin a canter‚Äù carrying 140 pounds, conceding 46 pounds to the runner-up. The win led to Minting being described as the crack horse of the English Turf. Another writer opined that in beating such a strong field, so easily with such a weight was \\"a feat I have never seen, nor shall I ever again.\\" In June he returned to Royal Ascot for a much less competitive renewal of the Hardwicke Stakes in which he had no difficulty conceding 46 pounds to his only opponent, a three-year-old filly named Love in Idleness. He missed his other target at the meeting, the Royal Hunt Cup, having been assigned an unprecedented weight of 156 pounds. When it was announced shortly afterwards that Minting would be retiring to stud at the end of the season, his ‚Äúbook‚Äù of mares was filled within a day. In autumn, he was sent to Newmarket for the Champion Stakes on October 10 against six rivals. He started 60/100 favourite but was beaten half a length by the three- year-old Friar‚Äôs Balsam. Assessment Minting's earnings of ¬£7,396 were the third highest by any horse in 1885. In early 1888 the official handicappers rated Minting fifteen pound superior to the winners of the Derby (Merry Hampton) and the St Leger (Kilwarlin), and he was regarded as the best horse in training. In commenting on the strength of the 1886 three-year-olds it was claimed that Minting could have won the Derby \\"nine years out of ten.\\" Stud career Minting retired to stud at Fairfield, near York at an initial fee of 100 guineas. His most notable progeny was the filly Maid of the Mint, dam of Spearmint. His son Minstrel, won Ascot Derby.

First described from Michigan in 1971, it is found in the eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed. Taxonomy The species was first described by American mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in their 1978 monograph on the boletes of Michigan. The type collection was made by Smith near Ann Arbor, and is stored at the University of Michigan Herbarium. The specific epithet rubroflammeus derives from the Latin words ruber (\\"red\\") and flammeus (\\"flaming\\"). Description All parts of the mushroom stain dark blue if bruised or injured. The shape of the cap of B. rubroflammeus is convex to broadly convex, and reaches a diameter of . The margin of the cap extends slightly beyond the tubes. The cap surface is dry and initially appears appressed-fibrillose (with fibrils pressed down flat against the surface) or has a matted grayish tomentum, but later the hairs slough off and the matted tomentum is present only along the cap margin. In maturity, the center of the caps develop slight cracks. The cap is a deep vinaceous-red color that remains constant throughout the life of the fruit bodies. The flesh is thick, soft, and yellow. Its taste is mild, and it has no distinct odor. On the underside of the cap, the spore-bearing surface comprises vertically arranged minute tubes with pore-like openings. The tubes are yellow, deep, initially adnate (fused) to the stem, but later becoming free from attachment (or nearly so). Individual pores are round and small (about 2 per mm), while the overall pore surface is uneven or pitted. Its color is initially deep red, but fades slightly in maturity; the pore surface quickly turns blue with injury. The stem is long, thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and equal in width throughout to club-shaped. Inside, it is yellowish with reddish streaks. Most of the stem surface is covered with coarse dark red reticulations, although near the top the color is yellow beneath the reticulations. All parts of the mushroom will quickly stain blue when cut, bruised, or otherwise injured. The mushroom is poisonous, and if consumed can cause gastrointestinal distress; typical symptoms include cramping, nausea, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Boletus rubroflammeus produces an olive-brown spore print. The spores are smooth, roughly oblong to slightly ventricose (swollen) in face view, in profile view inequilateral, and have dimensions of 10‚Äì14 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. Spores have a broad and shallow suprahilar depression (a depressed area on the dorsal side of the spore that was once attached to the sterigma). They are yellowish hyaline (translucent) in Melzer's reagent, and pale yellow-orange when mounted in a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped with a long pedicel (stalk), four-spored, and measure 30‚Äì40 by 8‚Äì9 Œºm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the tube faces) are rare to scattered, 28‚Äì37 by 9‚Äì15 Œºm, fusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped) to ventricose, and have a somewhat sharp tip. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges) are abundant, 18‚Äì35 by 5‚Äì9 Œºm, and roughly similar in shape to the pleurocystidia. When mounted in KOH, the cheilocystidia have a dingy orange-yellow color, and walls that are smooth and thin. The tissue of the tubes is bilateral, meaning that they have a central strand of roughly parallel hyphae from which other hyphae diverge. The central strand comprises interwoven hyphae that are floccose and orange-yellow in KOH; the diverging hyphae continue into the hymenium to form a subhymenium that contain smooth hyphae measuring 4‚Äì6 Œºm wide. The cap has a cuticle consisting of tightly interwoven pressed-down hyphae that are usually 3‚Äì5 Œºm wide. The hyphae in the epicuticular zone (a waxy layer on the surface of the cuticle) often have fine granular incrustations that can be seen in both KOH and Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of B. rubroflammeus. Similar species Distinctive field characteristics used to distinguish Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B. flammans is similar in appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R. rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B. permagnificus, has larger spores (13‚Äì16 by 5‚Äì6.5 Œºm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees. In addition to its geographic location, the Colombian species B. pyrrhosceles can be distinguished from B. rubroflammeus by its reddish-brown cap (fading to brownish orange in maturity), a brownish-red to deep red stem that is reticulated only at the top, and shallower tubes‚Äîup to . B. rhodocarpus, known only from Japan where it grows in deciduous forests, differs primarily in having brownish scales on the cap. Habitat and distribution Boletus rubroflammeus is a mycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups on the ground under hardwood trees. The fungus fruits in summer and autumn months, and tends to appear after hot weather and heavy rains. Known only from North America, its range extends from New England south to Tennessee, and west to Michigan. It has also been recorded from Mexico.

Following molecular studies outlining a new phylogenetic framework for Boletaceae, the fungus was transferred to the newly erected genus Exsudoporus in 2014, to which it is the type species. Nevertheless, Wu and colleagues (2016) were reluctant to accept the newly proposed genus due to a lack of sufficient sequences and regarded it a synonym of Butyriboletus.Wu G, Li YC, Zhu XT, Zhao K, Han LH, Cui YY, Li F, Xu J, Yang ZL.

The archaeological findings were dated over four periods from about 3850 to 3060 B.C. Site 5BL70, located near Hungry Whistler at , was used as a campsite and a place to gather wild plants. Stone tools were also made there. It was inhabited twice, once about 3700 B.C. and again about 3400 B.C.Gunnerson, James H. Archaeology of the High Plains.

It was also converted to a number of other home computers in the same year and the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 console in 1991. It is a fictional futuristic sport involving directing a puck to a goal by shooting small balls at it. Gameplay In game shot (Amiga). The black puck has just missed the goal after being deflected by the silver balls.The game is a unique futuristic sport which has been compared variously to pinball, the board game Crossfire and shove ha'penny. The player controls a cursor that can fire a stream of small balls. These are used to direct a puck across a court to score a goal. In the two-player game, this is hindered by your opponent, aiming for the opposite goal. In the single-player game, a form of gravity is the opposition. The game starts with a simple court but it gets progressively more difficult with added obstacles, simple mazes and bonus items. There are 130 courts in total (64 on the C64, 30 on the BBC/Electron). A court is completed when either player scores three goals. If the computer wins in the single-player game, that is game over although the game can be restarted from the same court. Goals can score a range of points depending on how far out they are scored from. The display is an overhead view showing a small section of the court that scrolls to follow the puck. Development and release The game was developed by Martin Edmondson for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was ported to MS-DOS and Commodore 64 with these four versions being published by the Psygnosis sub-label Psyclapse in 1989. It was also converted to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron by Peter Scott and released for those platforms by Superior Software, also in 1989. In 1991, it was released for the TuboGrafx-16 (published by Psygnosis in the US) / PC Engine (published by Coconuts Japan in Japan).

It is operated by Engie (previously known as GDF Suez Australian Energy), which owns 72 per cent of the power station. Mitsui owns the remaining 28 per cent. It burns natural gas in a combined cycle power station, comprising two 160 MW gas turbines and one 165 MW steam turbine, to generate up to 485 MW of electricity. Construction began in 1999. The plant has two GT13E2 gas turbines manufactured by ABB (now Alstom). The plant, including steam turbine and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), was manufactured and constructed by ABB. Fuel is supplied via either the SEAGas pipeline, which runs from the Iona Gas Plant in Victoria to the Pelican Point power station, or the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System (MAPS), which supplies gas from Moomba to Adelaide. Environmental protests In 1999, the proposed development of the Pelican Point Power Station led to widespread protests against its construction on environmental grounds, fearing hot water and chemical waste products from the station could harm local wildlife, in particular the dolphin and pelican populations of the Port River. These protests included a unanimous resolution by the City of Port Adelaide Enfield council to seek a legal injunction against its construction, and the formation of 'Community Action for Pelican Point' (later Community Action for Port and Peninsula), an organisation that organised protest marches both in the local area and at Parliament House, Adelaide, and a long term picket line to block the access road to the construction site. The protests and picket line led to multiple arrests, including that of the Mayor of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, Joanna McCluskey, for failure to comply with police requests to move. Notable participants in the protests included Ms McCluskey, local Kaurna representatives, as well as state and federal Australian Labor Party, Greens, Australian Democrats, and Independent MPs including Nick Xenaphon. Community engagement Since 2002 International Power have allowed school and community groups to tour Pelican Point Power Station. The tours were originally designed and run by The Investigator Science and Technology Centre, and were taken over by SciWorld when the Investigator closed in 2006. Since January 2009 the tours have been operated by Mobile Science Education. Reduced operation Since March 2013 the power station has generally operated at half capacity due to over-capacity in the South Australian region of the National Electricity Market. Grid generation capacity was reduced in early 2016 when the Northern Power Station closed. Generation at Pelican Point was increased to full capacity at the request of the South Australian government for at least a week in July 2016, due to much of the state's wind generation being offline due to damaging high winds, and the Heywood interconnector being unavailable due to works associated with a planned increase in its capacity. It returned to only operating one unit (half capacity) and the owner claimed that the National Electricity Market rules prohibited the second unit from responding to a request for electricity market responses on 8 February 2017. The result was that the extremely hot weather in Adelaide plus little wind to drive wind turbines led to the market operator requiring \\"load shedding\\" for 27 minutes during the evening electricity demand peak. The owner later clarified that it is not allowed to bid into the market if supply cannot be guaranteed, and it did not have a current gas supply contract for the second unit. It was able to respond promptly once directed to do so on 9 February during continuing high temperature weather. Engie advised AEMO on 5 June 2017 that they were currently operating at half capacity (239 MW), but would make full capacity available to the market (479 MW) as of 1 July 2017.

Formation  Macropinosomes have been described to form via a wave-like mechanism or via a tent-pole formation both of which processes require rapid polymerisation of actin-rich structures that rise up from the cell surface before collapsing back down into a macropinosome.  Function  Macropinosomes serve primarily in the uptake of solutes from the extracellular fluid. Once inside the cell, macropinosomes undergo a process of maturation characterized by increasing expression of Rab7 as they progress through the endocytic pathway, until they fuse with lysosomes where the contents of the macropinosome are degraded.  Regulation  PI3K and phosphoinositide phospholipase C activation have been shown to be necessary for macropinosome formation in fibroblasts. Members of the SNX family have also been shown to be important in macropinosome formation. Conversely, cyclic AMP has been shown to promote regurgitation from macropinosomes.  Role in pathogenesis  Because the process of macropinocytosis is non-specific, many pathogens take advantage of macropinosomes to infect their target cells. In this way, pathogens internalized in macropinosomes avoid barriers and obstructions that the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic crowding and cortical cytoskeleton pose when moving deeper into the cytoplasm. One example is Ebola virus, responsible for the devastating ebola virus disease, which stimulates macropinosome formation upon binding to the target cell surface. Vaccinia virus (VACV), a member of poxvirus family, has also been shown to partially utilize macropinocytosis for infectious cell entry. Here, both infectious forms of VACV, mature virion (MV) and enveloped virion (EV), induce their own macropinocytosis by binding to the cell surface and triggering an actin-mediated plasma membrane protrusion that eventually collapses back onto the plasma membrane sealing the attached virion inside a macropinosome, which then goes through a maturation program that leads to core activation and genome release.Rizopoulos Z, Balistreri G, Kilcher S, Martin CK, Syedbasha M, Helenius A, Mercer J. Vaccinia Virus Infection Requires Maturation of Macropinosomes. Traffic. 2015 Aug;16(8):814-31. doi: 10.1111/tra.12290. Epub 2015 May 6. PMID: 25869659; PMCID: PMC4973667.

MacMartin was the sole commissioner nominated by and representing the province of Ontario under provisions which reads: \\"That any future treaties with the Indians in respect of territory in Ontario to which they have not before the passing of the said Statutes surrendered their claim aforesaid shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the government of Ontario.\\" Under the provisions of this clause, the terms of the treaty were fixed by the governments of the Dominion and Ontario; Daniel G. MacMartin and the two other commissioners \\"were empowered to offer certain conditions, but were not allowed to alter or add to them in the event of their not being acceptable to the First Nations.\\" MacMartin's role was to protect the interests of the Ontario government whose agreement to make the treaty had to be sought and in whose jurisdiction reserves will be chosen and surveyed. MacMartin was to ensure that no reserves were located in areas with water power or mineral resources with future potential. MacMartin's incomplete 1905 journal was donated to the Queen's University archives in 1968. Although the journal was accessed by other researchers its significance was not fully recognised until c. 2010. Until the contents of diaries were revealed, details about the signing of the constitutionally recognized agreement were known only through the accounts of Duncan Campbell Scott and Samuel Stewart, commissioners appointed by the Government of Canada. The journals of the other two ‚Äì Samuel Stewart and Duncan Campbell Scott, both former employees of the Department of Indian Affairs, were easily accessible at the National Archives of Canada in Ottawa. MacMartin's diaries provide another perspective on the Treaty 9 tracing the treaty's origins, negotiation, explanation, interpretation, signing, implementation, and recent commemoration. He was a miner from Perth, Ontario and was considered to be an Indian Affairs outsider, albeit someone who was politically well-connected. It was suggested that he probably knew little about the process of treaty negotiations; however, from his journal entries, he seemed to realize that Treaty 9 was an anomaly. He had received the written Treaty prior to negotiations and realized that he had only fixed terms to offer and no authority to bargain. Toronto lawyer Murray Klippenstein, who earlier helped the Mushkegowuk First Nations of western James Bay to challenge the Mike Harris government's workfare legislation and launch their Rupert's Land Protection Pledge suit, also discovered the journal. Klippenstein claimed that in MacMartin's diaries oral promises had been made that contradicted the written Treaties and supports Elders' claims. He quoted from Commissioner MacMartin's diary, \\"it was explained to them that they could hunt and fish as of old\\" and \\"they were not restricted as of territory\\" and \\"they could hunt wherever they pleased.\\" Klippenstein argued that oral promises that are part of the Treaty should override legislation like the Far North Act.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King. The short was released on October 20, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary A tree comes down in a forest and several lumberjacks hack away at it with their axes. To the side, two lumberjacks, one a muscular man, the other one rather scrawny, chop at a tree, but only the larger man makes any progress. The skinny fellow prances off to a tiny sapling and with some effort chops it down, only to end up with pieces of it stuck to his head. The pieces resemble antlers. The lumber men have several inventive methods for chopping trees: one, involving a tractor-like vehicle with a large saw protruding from its side, leads to the felling of a guard tower in the forest! The scene switches to Buddy, who, upon chopping a tree with his axe, sends such a shake upwards that a mother and father bird are forced to remove their nest and babies from the tree top and carry the nest elsewhere. Some time obviously passes, for in the next scene, Buddy has already succeeded in felling the trunk. Merrily whistling away, Our Hero next gently glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk, in the process creating many toothpicks, which he then dumps into a truck, yelling to the driver: \\"Take it away!\\" Using a saw as though it were a jump rope, Buddy cuts a standing tree into several smaller pieces. Buddy so goads a goat that the creature chases him. The goat's horns cut through the suspended logs atop which Buddy runs from the pursuing creature. Eventually, the goat rams headfirst into a tree, and gets incapacitated. Buddy then carries an armful of small logs, but drops them, upon tripping, just perfectly that they are arranged across a wooden stand as a xylophone, which Buddy then plays by means of two axes: a totem pole comes to life and dances for the lumberjacks. The hard-working men are called to supper: enthusiastically, they wash up. A song before the meal: \\"I Open the Old Northwest\\", with Buddy at the piano. Cookie serves the men their spaghetti. As the men enjoy their food, a bear (with ears like those of Mickey Mouse) enters the dining cabin through its chimney; the men disappear (almost inexplicably, through the floorboards), leaving Cookie to scold the unwelcome beast. Having no success, Cookie hides and calls Buddy, who punches the bear in the nose, causing it to fall backwards into a stove and catch a stovepipe on its wounded snout. Now the bear is mad! Buddy throws hot pepper at the incensed creature, causing it to sneeze all of the dishes on the table back into place on a nearby shelf. A chase ensues. Reemerging, Cookie fires a shotgun at the bear's behind, causing the bear's focus to change. Buddy tosses the playing stool (which had been sitting at the piano) at the bear, and, in an inveterate gag, the stool's midsection extends underneath the bear that the invader is lifted out of the building (through the roof); the bear runs off as Buddy & Cookie, at the piano, sing \\"The Bear Went over the Mountain\\". Dating discrepancy The article Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929-1939) & Leonard Maltin's Of Mice and Magic, hereinafter cited, both claim October 20 as this cartoon's release date; however, conflicts arise as to the order in which the cartoons featuring Buddy were released.

It belongs to the Colubridae family. Two subspecies, Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus melanocephalus and Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus satunini, are currently recognized. Description The black-headed ground snake is a small, burrowing snake with a slender body reaching just in total length (body + tail). Its smooth and shiny dorsal scales and almost transparent covering make many of its internal organs quite visible, when observed against a light source. The eyes are small, with black irises. The head is covered with symmetrical large shields. The rostral shield is somewhat enlarged and specialized for digging through soil. The dorsal coloration may vary from tan to orange, with no obvious pattern except on the neck and head. The belly is clear white. The pattern on the neck and head is different in the two subspecies. In the nominate subspecies, Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus melanocephalus, there is no separation between the neck pattern and the head pattern. The upper surface of the head and neck is ash-black. Only the labials, the nasals, and the rostal are white. In R. melanocephalus satunini the neck carries a black semi-collar, and the head pattern consists of three transverse black saddles. The first one is on the rostral. The second spreads over the postnasal, supraorbital, and frontal, and partially over the prefrontal shields from eye to eye. The third saddle covers the parietal shields and some of the surrounding scales. The spaces between the black saddles are white, which makes Rhynchocalamus visually identifiable from similar looking species of the genera Eirenis and Pseudocyclophis, which often occupy the same habitat. Natural history Very little is known about the natural history of the black-headed ground snake. This burrowing species spends most of its life underground, and depends heavily on the soil humidity. It can be found only rarely, mainly under rocks, or extremely rarely on the surface after heavy rains in late spring and early summer. Diet This little predator forages on larvae and eggs of ants, and possibly other invertebrates. Geographic range This snake is known from dry shrublands of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern countries. There are records from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria,Turkey and in July, 2020 was formally noted in Cyprus. The southern part of its range is occupied by the nominotypical subspecies, Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus melanocephalus Jan, 1862. Populations from Armenia, Azerbaijan, northeastern Turkey, and northwestern Iran form the subspecies, Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus satunini Nikolsky, 1899. Habitats and ecology This snake is known from rocky, clayey semideserts. It spends most of its time underground, and rarely may be found under rocks after heavy rains in spring and early summer. Land use and protection Habitats of the black-headed ground snake have been largely irrigated or transformed into urban areas. Also, in many places, semidesert is being used as pasture for domestic goats, sheep, and cattle. Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, but was included in the Red Lists of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the former USSR as an extremely rare species.

Tomczak, Evidence of the barrier layer in the surface-layer of the tropics, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 97 (C5), 7305-7316, 1992. Barrier layer thickness (BLT) The thickness of the barrier layer is defined as the difference between mixed layer depth (MLD) calculated from temperature minus the mixed layer depth calculated using density. The first reference to this difference as the barrier layer was in a paper describing observations in the western Pacific as part of the Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study.Lukas, R., and E. Lindstrom, The Mixed Layer of the Western Equatorial Pacific-Ocean, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 96, 3343-3357, 1991 In regions where the barrier layer is present, stratification is stable because of strong buoyancy forcing associated with a fresh lens sitting on top of the water column. In the past, a typical criterion for MLD was the depth at which the surface temperature cools by 0.2 ¬∞C (see e.g. DT-02 in the Figure). Prior to the subsurface salinity available from Argo, this was the main methodology for calculating the oceanic MLD. More recently, a density criterion has been used to define the MLD, defined as the depth where the density increases from the surface value due to a prescribed temperature decrease of 0.2 ¬∞C from the surface value while maintaining constant surface salinity value. In the Figure, this is defined by Dsigma and corresponds to an isothermal/isohaline layer. The BLT is the difference of the temperature-defined MLD minus the density-defined value (i.e. DT-02 \\\\- Dsigma).  BLT Regimes  Large values of the BLT are typically found in the equatorial regions and can be as high as 50 m. Above the barrier layer, the well mixed layer may be due to local precipitation exceeding evaporation (e.g. in the western Pacific), monsoon related river runoff (e.g. in the northern Indian Ocean), or advection of salty water subducted in the subtropics (found in all subtropical ocean gyres). BLT formation in the subtropics is associated with seasonal change in the mixed layer depth, a sharper gradient in sea surface salinity (SSS) than normal, and subduction across this SSS front.Sato, K., T. Suga, and K. Hanawa, Barrier layers in the subtropical gyres of the world's oceans, Geophysical Research Letters, 33 (8), 2006. In particular, BLT is formed in winter season in the equatorward flank of subtropical salinity maxima. During early winter, the atmosphere cools the surface and strong wind and negative buoyancy forcing mixes temperature to a deep layer. At this same time, fresh surface salinity is advected from the rainy regions in the tropics. The deep temperature layer along with strong stratification in the salinity gives the conditions for BLT formation.Mignot, J., C.d.B. Montegut, A. Lazar, and S. Cravatte, Control of salinity on the mixed layer depth in the world ocean: 2. Tropical areas, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 112 (C10), 2007. For the western Pacific, the mechanism for BLT formation is different. Along the equator, the eastern edge of the warm pool (typically 28 ¬∞C isotherm - see SST plot in the western Pacific) is a demarcation region between warm fresh water to the west and cold, salty, upwelled water in the central Pacific. A barrier layer is formed in the isothermal layer when salty water is subducted from the east into the warm pool due to local convergence and warm fresh water overrides denser water to the east. Here, weak winds, heavy precipitation, eastward advection of low salinity water, westward subduction of salty water and downwelling equatorial Kelvin or Rossby waves are factors that contribute to deep BLT formation.Bosc, C., T. Delcroix, and C. Maes, Barrier layer variability in the western Pacific warm pool from 2000 to 2007, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 114, 2009.  Significance of BLT  Prior to El Nino, the warm pool stores heat and is confined to the far western Pacific. During the El Nino, the warm pool migrates eastward along with the concomitant precipitation and current anomalies. The fetch of the westerlies is increased during this time, reinforcing the event. Using data from ship of opportunity and Tropical Atmosphere ‚Äì Ocean (TAO) moorings in the western Pacific, the east and west migration of the warm pool was tracked over 1992-2000 using sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), currents, and subsurface data on conductivity as a function of temperature and depth taken on various research cruises.Delcroix, T., and M. McPhaden, Interannual sea surface salinity and temperature changes in the western Pacific warm pool during 1992-2000, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 107 (C12), 2002. This work showed that during westward flow, the BLT in the western Pacific along the equator (138oE-145oE, 2oN-2oS) was between 18 m ‚Äì 35 m corresponding with warm SST and serving as an efficient storage mechanism for heat. BLT formation is driven by westward (i.e. converging and subducting) currents along the equator near the eastern edge of the salinity front that defines the warm pool. These westward currents are driven by downwelling Rossby waves and represent either a westward advection of BLT or a preferential deepening of the deeper thermocline versus the shallower halocline due to Rossby wave dynamics (i.e. these waves favor vertical stretching of the upper water column). During El Nino, westerly winds drive the warm pool eastward allowing fresh water to ride on top of the local colder/saltier/denser water to the east. Using coupled, atmospheric/ocean models and tuning the mixing to eliminate BLT for one year prior to El Nino, it was shown that the heat buildup associated with BLT is a requirement for big El Nino.Maes, C., J. Picaut, and S. Belamari, Importance of the salinity barrier layer for the buildup of El Ni√±o, Journal of Climate, 18 (1), 104-118, 2005. It has been shown that there is a tight relationship between SSS and SST in the western Pacific and the barrier layer is instrumental in maintaining heat and momentum in the warm pool within the salinity stratified layer.Maes, C., K. Ando, T. Delcroix, W.S. Kessler, M.J. McPhaden, and D. Roemmich, Observed correlation of surface salinity, temperature and barrier layer at the eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool, Geophysical Research Letters, 33 (6), 2006. Later work, including Argo drifters, confirm the relationship between eastward migration of the warm pool during El Nino and BLT heat storage in the western Pacific. The main impact of BLT is to maintain a shallow mixed layer allowing an enhanced air-sea coupled response. In addition, the BLT is the key factor in establishing the mean state that is perturbed during El Nino/La Nina Maes, C., and S. Belamari, On the Impact of Salinity Barrier Layer on the Pacific Ocean Mean State and ENSO, Sola, 7, 97-100, 2011.

It is a relatively high boiling liquid (boiling point: 85‚àí90 ¬∞C at 13 torr) and is a precursor (via hydrogenation) to the rubber additive bis(tetrahydrofuryl)propane used in the manufacture of high vinyl content rubber for high performance tires.  Synthesis  Furan and ketones react under the action of acidic catalysts yielding difuryl condensation products, higher oligomers, as well as cyclic furan tetramers (tetraoxaquterenes). If the number of furan moieties in the oligomer is denoted as n, the number of isopropylidene moieties (derived from acetone) is n-1. In the case of aldehydes only linear oligomers are formed. The simplest adduct of furan and acetone is 2,2-di-2-furylpropane, the title compound. This molecule is typically synthesized employing two equivalents of furan and one equivalent of acetone employing concentrated hydrochloric acid as the catalyst at ambient temperature and pressure. Alternatively, the reaction may be cooled during the addition of reagents and in the early phases.Rudolf Faust, et al., \\"Silyl- functional living cationic polymers\\", US Patent 6,051,657 (2000) Inasmuch as the two furan moieties in 2,2-di-2-furylpropane may further react, at their respective unsubstituted 5-positions, with additional acetone the formation of oligomers can not be completely suppressed. However, the amount of oligomer is effected by reaction conditions, including the furan to acetone ratio and the amount of hydrochloric acid catalyst employed. Purification 2,2-Di-2-furylpropane may be obtained from crude aqueous acidic reaction mixtures (typically biphasic) by allowing phase separation followed by neutralization of the organic layer.

The EP was released on 4 December 2011.  Album information  The title Brumalia comes from an ancient Roman solstice festival honouring Bacchus, often involving drinking and merriment. The name is derived from the Latin word bruma, meaning \\"shortest day\\" or even \\"winter\\".Robert Mazza, 'Choricius of Gaza, Oration XIII: Religion and State in the Age of Justinian', in Robert M. Frakes, Elizabeth DePalma Digeser, Justin Stephens (ed.), The Rhetoric of Power in Late Antiquity: Religion and Politics in Byzantium, Europe and the early Islamic World (London/New York, Tauris Academic Studies, 2010), 172‚Äì193 (Library of Classical Studies, 2). Each track was written by Wolf throughout 2011, except for the adaptation of Jerusalem. Production and programming took place in The Pool Studios on Bermondsey Street, London in autumn 2011. The EP features one track created on an iPad, whilst Wolf was travelling through Florida.  Album artwork  The artwork for the EP was shot by Patti Smith. Of the artwork, Wolf said, > \\"These are two photos Patti took of me on Cooden Beach on a freezing windy > Winter day earlier this year the day after I played harp and viola for her > at the De La Warr Pavilion. To me the photos sum up the bleakness and > melancholy of England in the Winter months, which was something that > inspired the choice of songs on this EP\\"  Track listing   Reception  The album received mixed to positive reviews. A reviewer at Clixie Music hailed it as a \\"swirl of beautiful melodies driving a highly romantic record, destined for your hearts from very beginning\\" that reads \\"almost like a personal diary from start to finish.\\" Although reviewer Hayley Avron compliments aspects of the individual tracks, she is unimpressed by the EP as a whole, stating that it is overshadowed by the full-length Lupercalia. Avron concludes that although individually strong, the EP as a whole lacks the \\"instant warm appeal of the Lupercalia tracks\\" and \\"as a mini-album,\\" makes for \\"an unsteady journey\\" in which the tracks \\"end up feeling a little like a case of concept over content.\\" Andy Gill from The Independent describes \\"Time of Year\\" as a song with \\"big beats, cheesy honking reeds and a brief rattle of sleighbells,\\" but does not comment on the overall album. Jazz Monroe from NME commends the album for exposing the \\"blemishes\\" otherwise perfected in other artists, but describes much of Wolf's vocals on the album as \\"wailing,\\" \\"whining,\\" \\"warbling,\\" and \\"brooding.\\" He praises the song \\"Jerusalem\\" as a \\"glisteningly elegiac centrepiece\\" for the album. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork sees the album as an attempted reconstruction of Wolf's first two LPs, but states that although the album's tracks are \\"as lavishly produced as his proper records, the little sonic footnotes and specificity give Brumalia a demo-level, real-time immediacy that rarely comes through despite his gregarious persona.\\" Cohen concludes by stating that \\"Wolf remains theoretically fascinating because he tries too hard\\" and that the EP \\"ends up being as frustrating as his previous albums because Wolf appears capable of giving us anything to the point where comfort is not enough.\\" References Category:2011 EPs Category:Patrick Wolf albums ","title":"Brumalia EP"},{"id":"33938639","text":"Marie-√àve Janvier is a Canadian singer from Quebec, born in 1984 in Roxton Pond, Estrie, Quebec.

She has hosted a radio (broadcast on 940 AM) and television program titled Mujer No Est√°s Sola‚Ä¶ ¬°Rompe El Silencio! (or \\"Woman You Are Not Alone ... Break The Silence!\\"). The television program, which started airing on Monday, 15 April 2019, was initially produced by the Puerto Rico Public Broadcasting Corporation and broadcast at 11:00 on WIPR-TV (San Juan) and WIPM (Mayag√ºez). The first episode was dedicated to Jomayra Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, a 13-year-old girl who was burned by her ex-boyfriend, who would die from her wounds a month later. On Monday, June 17, 2019, V√°zquez Nieves hosted an episode titled Elsie‚Ä¶ ¬°No Est√°s Sola! (or \\"Elsie... You Are Not Alone!\\"), named after a mother and daughter who survived an explosion and fire in their home caused by Hurricane Mar√≠a. On 15 July 2020, after having dealt with 545 cases, it as announced that the show would move to WOLE-DT (Univisi√≥n Puerto Rico) and would be broadcast on the 1:30 p.m. time slot. During July 2019, V√°zquez Nieves received a threat through a letter on e-mail to her office in San Juan and later a second one to her Mayag√ºez office, which she turned into a publicity ploy, stating she will not be intimidated, taking legal action and having it reported to local newspapers. The letter contained a quotation from Tom Holland's popular history book Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic. The quote, which alluded to the assassination of Julius Caesar, read \\"Some sixty men stood in a press around him. All of them had drawn daggers from under their togas. All of them were well known to Caesar. Many were former enemies who had accepted his pardon ‚Äì but even more were friends.\\" In her official judicial filing, V√°zquez Nieves stated she felt \\"insecure, worried and threatened,\\" to which, Col. Henry Escalera Rivera, the Commissioner of the Puerto Rico Police Bureau, said the matter will be investigated, however she would not be given a police escort. After the effects of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, V√°zquez Nieves was scheduled to meet with general assistant of the National Guard, Jos√© Reyes and make both a radio telemarathon on the Puerto Rico Public Broadcasting Corporation. After the House of Representatives introduced a measure to increase the minimum wage, Nieves V√°zquez expressed that the minimum wage for private sector employees should be increased from the federal of $7.25 per hours to $9.00. For public sector employees it is $8.25 an hour. On 22 December 2019, she endorsed Governor Wanda V√°zquez's 2020 election campaign, by making a play on Goya Foods slogan, \\"If it's Wanda, it has to be good.\\" Amid rumours that Wanda V√°zquez would transfer control of the Juan A. Rivero Zoo from the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources to the Municipality of Mayag√ºez, under Jos√© Guillermo Rodr√≠guez, V√°zquez Nieves clarified that there was a commitment that by the end of March 2020 the governor would visit the zoo. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico, the meeting was postponed and held on 11 July 2020, where she did not maintain social distance. V√°zquez Nieves was the author of Law 49‚Äì2020, which created a hotline for survivors of domestic abuse under the number code 0-0-0. This was criticized by feminist activists as a duplicity of efforts since this new hotline was attached to the Office of the Women's Advocate, which already has such a hotline. In the aftermath of the Puerto rico earthquakes a report as part of an investigation accused V√°zquez of withholding aid to displaced people and using it as a political tool. V√°zquez Nieves decided to change her aspiration to the senate from a District, to an at-large one. This meant, her votes would come from the whole island instead of a geographical area considered unwinnable from her. On August 16, 2020 she lost the 2020 Primaries of the New Progressive Party as she failed to obtain enough votes to make it to the general election. Personal life V√°zquez started a relationship with entrepreneur Peter Muller around 2009. Muller, who was married at the time, got divorced on grounds of adultery with V√°zquez being singled out as the reason for the divorce. She also has a daughter called Andrea from a previous relationship.Evelyn V√°zquez ‚Äúenchul√°‚Äù de Peter Muller on El Vocero; Santiago T√∫a, Lynet (January 25, 2011)]Piden investigar evento manejado por Peter Muller en Mayag√ºez on Primera Hora (November 22, 2011) She currently resides at 1 Bondad Street at the Para√≠so Urbanization, a gated-community in Mayag√ºez. Her husband owns a mansion in Caguas at 1 Trinitaria Street in the exclusive neighborhood of Alturas de Caguas. On 11 October 2019, she was declared by Mayag√ºez mayor, Jos√© Guillermo Rodr√≠guez as a \\"Favorite Daughter of the City\\" in a ceremony for such purpose held at the Teatro Yag√ºez. In mid 2020, a Twitter thread went viral comparing V√°zquez Nieves' dress sense to that of Peruvian singer La Tigresa del Oriente.  Wedding to Peter Muller Maldonado  During some time before December 2016, Muller Maldonado proposed to V√°zquez Nieves during a formal dinner at the La Concha's Perla Restaurant in Condado. It was revealed two weeks before the ceremony that it would be held at the main plaza of downtown Mayag√ºez, with entertainment by Glenn Monroig and the toast would be made by then-governor-elect, Ricardo Rossell√≥. The menu, which had the initials of the couple on the letterhead and a large clear rhinestone underneath, listed roasted succulent pig shank, pigeons peas, \\"grandma's rice\\" and potato salad. She had always believed that her wedding would be a \\"village wedding\\" and had jointly decided with Muller Maldonado that it would be a \\"Christmas gift, and as a token of appreciation to the constituents\\" and that she would stay with the general public until at least 6:30 pm The ceremony, which was officiated by Pastor Lydia Pag√°n, was held in a blue carpet gazebo in front of the Mayag√ºez City Hall, built especially for the occasion and decorated with white flowers, roses, hydrangeas, calla lilies and petunias, in front of 250 guests. They had music and food for all members of the general public who attended. The ceremony was supposed to start at 4:00 pm on Saturday, December 17, 2016, however, neither the couple nor the guests had arrived since there was some light rain. Special attention was given by the guests to PPD Mayag√ºez mayor, Jos√© Guillermo Rodr√≠guez, who sported a blue shirt and tie, the colors of the PNP, to the ceremony, where afterwards Rossell√≥, who was accompanied by his wife Beatriz Rossell√≥, joked about it. V√°zquez Nieves left the Howard Johnson hotel close by on a white horse drawn buggy to the ceremony, which was hosted by actor Edgardo Huertas. V√°zquez Nieves was escorted down the aisle by her mother, Matilde Nieves and had her daughter, Andrea, as maid of honor. Also in her bridal entourage were her niece, Pamela, her goddaughter, Kathia, as well as her two nephews, Diego and Jos√© Luis. The rings were carried by a younger relation, Destiny. The godparents of the wedding were Yanitzia Irizarry and Efra√≠n Acevedo. Jos√© Juan Ta√±√≥n sang \\"Avemar√≠a\\" and \\"Cu√°n grande es √©l\\" during the ceremony. Throughout the whole event V√°zquez Nieves had three wedding dresses, two of them with mantilla, from Radel's Novia in San Sebasti√°n, and four different hairstyles by Pedro Machado. The wedding reception was held at the old Casino of Mayag√ºez. References External links *Hon.

It was first flown on 19 August 2009 and is built in Slovakia by Shark.Aero s.r.o.. It has optionally fixed or retractable landing gear. Design and development The Shark, which was formally announced at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2007, was designed to fit into both European UL and US LSA categories. Structurally it is a mixture of glass- and carbon-fibre composites (whilst fibreglass is utilised to a very limited extent), with PVC foam filled aramid honeycomb structures sandwiched between panels. The wing main spar is a dismountable two piece carbon fibre beam which joins under the front seat; an auxiliary spar carries the aileron and flap mountings. In plan the leading edge is elliptical and there is slight taper on the outer trailing edge where the ailerons are mounted. Single slotted, electrically operated flaps occupy the rest of the trailing edge. Like the wings, the slightly swept tailplanes are easily detached for storage of transport. There is an electrically operated trim tab in the elevator. The fuselage of the Shark is formed with integral fin, seat backs, floors and instrument panel. The fin, set forward so the rudder trailing edge is above the elevator hinge line, is shaped like a shark's back fin, strongly swept and with a curved leading edge. There is also a small ventral fin. From the fin forward the upper fuselage line rises rapidly to merge into that of the side hinged, single piece canopy. There is a big baggage space behind the cockpit. Both of the adjustable tandem seats have flight controls; the Shark is flown by a sidestick. It is powered by a Rotax 912ULS or Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant, driving a three-blade or a two- blade propeller. The Shark UL has retractable gear and a variable-pitch propeller.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 79. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The prototype Shark, Czech registered as OK-OUR01, first flew on 19 August 2009. The first flight of the UL was expected early in 2010 but had not happened by January 2011. The design entered production in mid-2011. The Shark's wings and tail were adapted for use on the Slovenian OneAircraft One design. Operational history The third Shark was registered in France as 83AJR with callsign F-JSOR in early 2011 but was destroyed whilst competing in the Paris-Madrid air race on 21 June 2011. It appears however that this aircraft was later rebuilt as the callsign was noted using hex-code 381BBD from May 2015. The fourth appears on the Czech register, flying as a demonstrator in Germany. In 2015 the design, equipped with a modified engine and a special DUC propeller, set a world record for class RAL2T (Microlights: Movable Aerodynamic Controls/Landplane/Flown with two persons/Thermal Engine) for speed over a straight course at 303.00 km/h.

Slit refers to a secreted protein that is most widely known as a repulsive axon guidance cue, and Robo refers to its transmembrane protein receptor. There are four different Robos and three Slits in vertebrates: Robo1, Robo2, Robo3/Rig-1, and Robo4, and Slit1, Slit2, Slit3. There are three Robos and a single Slit in Drosophila. The corresponding Slit and Robo homologues in C. elegans are Slt and Sax-3, respectively. Slits are characterized by four distinct domains, each containing variable numbers of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), seven to nine EGF repeats, an ALPS domain (Agrin, Perlecan, Laminin, Slit), and a cysteine knot. Robos are characterized by five Ig-like domains, three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats, a transmembrane portion, and an intracellular tail with up to four conserved cytoplasmic motifs: CC0 (a potential site of tyrosine phosphorylation), CC1 (also a potential site of tyrosine phosphorylation and binds P3 domain of netrin-1 receptor DCC), CC2 (polyproline stretch; consensus binding site for Ena/Vasp proteins), and CC3 (polyproline stretch).  Background and discovery  In the developing nervous system of bilaterians, most axons cross over to the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. What are the genes that ensure that this process occurs appropriately? This fundamental question in axon guidance led researchers to Robo, which was identified in a large-scale screening of Drosophila mutants in the early 1990s. Robo expression was shown to be required for repulsion of axons from the midline, both in ipsilateral axons that never cross the midline and in commissural axons that had already crossed. Another protein Commissureless (Comm) was found to be an essential regulator of Robo: in comm mutants, Robo activity is too high, and no axons cross the midline. Several years later, genetic evidence, biochemical binding experiments, and explant assays identified Slits as the repulsive ligands for Robo receptors in both Drosophila and vertebrates. Slit was also found to act as a repulsive cue in olfactory bulb guidance. The high conservation of Slit and Robo structures and the similarities in their function among vertebrates and invertebrates make a strong case for an evolutionarily conserved requirement for Slit/Robo signaling in the developing nervous system.  Cell signaling pathways   Slit-robo binding  The functional region of Slit proteins is located within the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Slit2 binds Robo1 in a flexible linkage between its D2 domain and the first two Ig-like domains of Robo1. Research suggests that heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are required for Slit signaling in Drosophila, may support this interaction through stabilization of the Slit-Robo complex or by acting as co-receptors that present Slits to Robos.  Intracellular robo-binding events  Function of Slit-Robo signaling is influenced by binding of intracellular factors to the cytoplasmic domains of Robo. = Abelson and Enabled = In Drosophila, the two proteins Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) and Enabled (Ena) mediate cytoskeletal remodeling downstream of Slit-Robo signaling. Abl can phosphorylate Robo's CC0 and CC1 domains thereby down-regulating Robo activity, while Ena interacts with CC0 and CC2 to mediate repulsive signaling. Abl is also thought to promote repulsive signaling by binding to adenylyl cyclase associated proteins (CAP), which regulate actin polymerization. = Rho GTPases = Binding of Slit to Robo induces binding of SrGAP1 to the CC3 domain of Robo1, which leads to downstream deactivation of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase which mediates actin polymerization, and activation of RhoA, a Rho GTPase which mediates actin depolymerization. In Drosophila, the SH3-SH2 adaptor protein Dock binds directly to the CC2 and CC3 domains of Robo, recruiting p21-activated protein kinase (Pak) and Sos, resulting in increased Rac activity. This Robo-Dock association is increased by Slit-Robo binding, as is the recruitment of Sos. Drosophila Robo also directly interacts with the GAP Vilse or CrossGAP, which may function to down-regulate Rac activity. = Netrin receptor DCC = Another way Slit-Robo signaling might mediate repulsion from the midline is by silencing the receptor of the attractive guidance cue netrin-1, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), thereby inactivating netrin-1-mediated attraction to the midline. Robo binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of DCC and experiments with Xenopus explants have shown that this interaction silences netrin-mediated attraction; however, in vivo experiments have not yet confirmed the relevance of this mechanism for commisural axon guidance in embryos.  Interactions with commissureless  Drosophila Commissureless (Comm) is a transmembrane protein expressed in commissural neurons. Comm promotes midline crossing by down-regulating Robo. A LPSY sorting signal motif has been shown to be required for Comm to sort Robo to endosomes, preventing it from accessing the surface of the growth cone. Thus, when Comm is expressed, axons are unaffected by the presence of Slit and are able to cross the midline. Comm expression is tightly regulated to ensure that axons down- regulate Robo at the correct time. In the absence of Comm, Robo is not appropriately down-regulated and all axons fail to cross the midline.  Functions  Slits mediate cell communication in many diverse systems, regulating the guidance, cell migration and polarization of many different cell types.  Axon guidance  Slit-Robo interactions regulate axon guidance at the midline for commissural, retinal, olfactory, cortical, and precerebellar axons. Deletions of individual robos do not phenotypically match Slit mutants, indicating that Robos1-3 play distinct, complementary but not entirely overlapping roles in axon guidance. In Drosophila, Slit interactions with Robo1 and Robo2 function together in determining whether an axon will cross the midline, and both are necessary for proper crossing. Robo2 and Robo3 function together to specify the lateral position of the axon relative to the midline. The overlapping expression gradients of Robos along longitudinal tracts in the Central Nervous System (CNS) have been referred to as the \\"Robo- code,\\" but it is unknown whether the formation of specific longitudinal tracts, mediated in this way by Robo, involves Slit signaling. It has been speculated that homophilic and heterophilic binding among Robos may be sufficient to mediate this effect. In vertebrates, Robo1 and Robo2 work together to mediate repulsion from Slit ligands expressed at the floor plate, while Robo3/Rig-1 has the opposite activity, and functions to promote attraction to the midline (most likely by inhibiting the other two Robo receptors, via an unknown mechanism). Mice lacking all three Robos or all three Slits exhibit a phenotype similar to the Drosophila Slit mutant.  Axonal and dendritic branching  Slit2 and Slit1 have been shown to function as potential positive regulators of axon collateral formation during establishment or remodeling of neural circuits. In fact Slit2-N, an N-terminal fragment of Slit2, has been shown to induce Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) elongation and branching, whereas full length Slit2 antagonizes this effect. In central trigeminal sensory axons, however, full length Slit2, through interactions with semaphorin receptor plexin-A4 regulates axonal branching. Interactions between Slit and Robo in this process are unclear, but DRG express Robo2 and trigeminal axons express Robo1-2. Slit-Robo interactions are highly implicated, however, in the dendritic development of cortical neurons in that exposure to Slit1 leads to increased dendritic outgrowth and branching while inhibition of Slit-robo interactions attenuates dendritic branching.  Topographic projections  Axonal targeting by Slit-Robo appears to play an important role in the organization of topographic projections of axons which correspond to somatosensory receptive fields. In the Drosophila visual system, Slit and Robo prevent mixing of lamaina and lobula cells. Variable expression of Robo receptors on Drosophila olfactory neurons controls axonal organization in the olfactory lobes. In vertebrates, Slit1 plays an important role in vomeronasal organ (VNO) axonal targeting to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). In 2009, a combination of Slit-Robo and Netrin-Frazzled signaling in Drosophila was shown to govern the establishment of myotopic maps, which describe the innervation of motorneuron dendrites in the muscle field.  Cell migration  Slit-Robo has been shown to influence the migration of neurons and glia, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. Slit1 and Slit2 mediate the repulsive activity of the septum and choroid plexus which orient the migration of undifferentiated cells of the subventricular zone (SVZ) on the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate into olfactory neurons. The contribution of Robo signaling in this system is unclear, but it is known that migrating neuroblasts do express Robo2 and Robo3 mRNAs. During the developmental of mouse peripheral auditory system, Slit/Robo signaling imposes a restriction force on spiral ganglia neurons to ensure their precise positioning for correct spiral ganglia-cochlear hair cells innervations.S.Z. Wang, L.A. Ibrahim, Y.J. Kim, D.A. Gibson, H.C. Leung, W. Yuan, K.K. Zhang, H.W. Tao, L. Ma, L.I. Zhang Slit/Robo signaling mediates spatial positioning of spiral ganglion neurons during development of cochlear innervation J. Neurosci., 30 (2013), pp. 12242‚Äì12254  Implications in disease   Cancer and vascular disease  Inhibition of Robo1, which colocalizes with von Willebrand factor in tumor endothelial cells, leads to reduced micro-vessel density and tumor mass of malignant melanoma. Slit2 is known to mediate this effect. Robo4, also known as magic roundabout, is an endothelial specific Robo which, upon binding Slit2, blocks Src family kinase activation, thereby inhibiting VEGF-165-induced migration and permeability in vitro and vascular leak in vivo. This suggests that combined VEGF/Slit2 therapies could be useful in preventing tumor angiogenesis and vascular leak or edema after heart attack or stroke.  Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis  The homozygous Robo3 mutations have been associated with typical ophthalmologic horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis, which is characterized by oculomotor problems and general disturbances in innervation.  Dyslexia  Robo1 has been implicated as one of 14 different candidate genes for dyslexia, and one of 10 that fit into a theoretical molecular network involved in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Slit2 is predicted to play a role in the network.

The cars also had thick carpet. Then came the second series cars, named for their color (i.e. Mariner Gray was called \\"Silver Dragon\\") and vinyl on the roof, which had a different pattern to it than the interior, and so was called Dinosaur. The last series came only in Tropical Green and were called \\"Jade Dragons\\". This option cost $125.  1953  After a year of no Dragons, the 1953 Kaiser Dragon was introduced on Oct. 31, 1952. This time, the Dragon was a separate model, not a trim option. These cars were upscale, and had many high-end standard features, such as an electric clock, a radio, a heater, a \\"Bambu\\" vinyl top that resembled bamboo, 14-karat gold plated hood and fender nameplates, interior trim (including a nameplate on the glove box door that was personalized with the owner's name), and hood ornament, plus power steering and padding in the glove box. They only came as four-door sedans. Safety features were added to what was called \\"The world's first safety first car\\" (even though the Tucker 48, a car known for unique features, including safety items, came out five years earlier). Items like a full padded dash, a pop out windshield, recessed instruments, and a \\"safety angle seat\\" were standard. Front leg room was , with rear leg room at 39.5 inches. These cars were expensive for the time at $3,924 (a comparable 1953 Buick Roadmaster cost $3,358 and came with Buick's 188 hp 322CID V8, vs. the Dragon's 118 hp I6). Along with the expense, 0-60 mph time was a slow 15 seconds (which was slower than a Buick Super). Only 1,277 ended up being sold.

Awesome chapters assume no ownership of the projects they fund and provide the funds with no strings attached. History The Awesome Foundation was founded by Tim Hwang in Boston in 2009. Tim developed the idea along with Emily Daniels and Jon Pierce during a road trip to a meet up at AS220 and soon after sent out the call for the first set of trustees. Less than two weeks after the call, the foundation announced its first trustees. Notable projects The Awesome Foundation has funded a wide range of projects including the arts, science, and social causes. Examples include creating a free library system in Chicago using birdhouses, growing mushrooms from phonebooks in Ottawa and theatre for street youth in Edmonton. The inaugural $1,000 grant from the organization went towards the construction of a giant, long hammock in Boston. The resulting final project set a record for the world's largest portable hammock, using curved steel pipes to frame 4,278 feet of rope fashioned from recycled bottles. A video of Random Swings of Joy, a project funded by the Los Angeles chapter to install $1,000 worth of swings around the city, went viral in June 2011, receiving coverage from the Huffington Post, CBS News, and LAist. Swings have also been installed in The Marshal Islands, Panama, San Francisco, and Toronto. Following the success of the Los Angeles video, Jeff Waldman started a kickstarter project to bring the project to Bolivia, where the median age in 2011 was just 22.5. Chapters There are 96 active chapters of the organization in operation. Chapters are based in cities or small locales around the world with four chapters dedicated to specific causes worldwide. Chapters are autonomous, though the original Boston chapter spearheaded an organizational model of consensus-based decision-making. Chapters have access to all of the applications that the Awesome Foundation receives, though many will first look at applicants in their geographic area. Institute on Higher Awesome Studies The Awesome Foundation is an autonomous collection of chapters, but is loosely shepherded by the Institute on Higher Awesome Studies. The Institute has applied for non- profit 501(c)3 status, and seeks to provide infrastructure (such as the Awesome Foundation website) and spread Awesome as widely as possible.http://blog.awesomestudies.org/about Awesome Foundation trustees and board members include * Dan Barber, chef, Awesome Food trustee * Amanda Hesser, journalist and entrepreneur, Awesome Food trustee * Jennifer 8.

Retrieved December 3, 2011. The Trinidad sites were found in 1962 when Herbert Dick of the Trinidad State Junior College led an archaeological investigation of the Trinidad Reservoir. By 1980, more archaeological studies had been completed of a total of 300 sites. Site 5LA1416 contained evidence of occupation through all three Sopris phases. The architecture may have been influenced by the Plains villagers, Panhandle and Rio Grande cultures. The pottery, though, was decidedly like that of the Puebloans of the Rio Grande area.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 223‚Äì224. . The Leone Bluff (Site 5LA1211) and Site ID 5LA1416 sites had evidence of four dwellings identified as Sopris Phase occupations from about A.D. 1150 to 1300. The pottery remnants were used to identify the Sopris Phase and three subsequent periods of inhabitation: post- Sopris Phase (about A.D. 1300‚Äì1450), historic Spanish-American (about A.D. 1670‚Äì1890) and historic Apache (about A.D. 1750‚Äì1900).Ireland, Stephen K.

Trinchera Cave Archeological District is also a Sopris Phase site. Phases The architecture, pottery and material goods varied greatly during the Sopris Phases. Initial The initial Sopris Phase occurred between 1000-1100 A.D. People dwelled in pit-houses, jacal structures and campsites. Pottery found at initial Sopris sites included Taos gray and distinctly different Sopris plain pottery. Corner-notched points are the most popular projectile points used. Basin metates were used during this time. Early The next period occurred between 1100-1150 A.D. Dwellings were made of adobe or a combination of adobe and jacal construction. Pottery found in early Sopris sites include: Taos gray, Sopris plain pottery, and the appearance of black on white, cordmarked, polished and incised pottery. Material goods included metates, turquoise, beads of stone and shell. Maize was farmed a little during this period. Late The last period occurred between 1150-1250 A.D. Houses were made of sandstone slab masonry, with rounded corners and posts for support. There was a predominance of Taos black on white and Taos gray incised pottery during this time. Grooved mauls and slab metates appeared during this period.

Reeves appears to have known manager J. L. Wilkinson long before the All Nations team was formed, when they both toured with the Des Moines Hopkins Bros. team, the Bloomer Girls. 1913 All Nations In the 1912 and 1913 seasons, Reeves often caught for Negro leaguer John Donaldson in games where the battery racked up an average of 15 strike outs per game. He also caught for Cuban Hall of Fame pitcher Jos√© M√©ndez, and many other well-known pitchers of the day. Throughout the 19-teens, Reeves was very widely known across Iowa as a \\"Wrestling Champion.\\" However, there were no official records kept except through newspaper accounts. Reeves became an auctioneer in 1919, but in the 1920 Census, Reeves listed he was a farmer, renting land in the Graettinger, Iowa area. He started another baseball team in 1920, calling the team the \\"Twilight Stars.\\" The team changed their name to the \\"Wolves\\" by 1922. Reeves continued to wrestle in the early 1920s. And he even brought competition to farming, where in 1924 Reeves claimed he would have a higher yield than his neighbor, Mr. O. R. Gardner.

The population at the 2006 census was 378. After European settlement of the area in the 1840s mixed farming was conducted by many landowners and leasees until the introduction of the milking machine followed by a period where most farms derived a large proportion of their income from dairying. Since 1970 most of the smaller dairies have ceased operating and the few remaining farms are considerably larger in size often using land previously used by smaller dairy farms. Facilities Wangoom hosts a general store and post office (first registered in 1877) which provides a range of services including Tea Rooms. Also located in the main thoroughfare is a memorial town hall, two tennis courts, CFA Fire Station and a disused milk depot. Wangoom General Store est 1908 Wangoom Milk Depot Wangoom Tennis Hardcourts Wangoom Fire Station Wangoom Memorial Hall C1963 The Wangoom Recreation Reserve (c1921) is the home of the Wangoom Cricket Club which has three senior and two junior teams competing in the Grassmere Cricket Association.. The reserve is also used by the Warrnambool Cyclist Club. The reserve was formally the home of the Wangoom Football and Women's Basketball Clubs both now in recess. The Hopkins Falls at Wangoom is a popular tourist attraction and a site to be seen particularly when heavy inflows occur and torrents of water and foam roar over the falls. The Crawley (formally Hopkins Falls ) Bridge which crosses the Hopkins River above the falls at in length and containing six spans was completed in 1938. The Bridge was renamed in 1962 to honour the service to the Warrnambool Shire by members of the Crawley family.

Lake Wangoom was a popular attraction for locals and visitors alike to conduct activities such as fishing and boating in the early days of white settlement however at the turn of the 20th century the lake dried out naturally and could no longer be relied upon as a regular water course. The lake land was sold to adjoining landholders and a pumping station set up to drain water from the lake to the nearby Hopkins River. There is no current public access to the 'lake'. The Wangoom State School (formally National School) operated from 1852 till its closure in 1992. The school building remains on site while the school house was sold and removed to Lake Gillear.

His older brother, Leopoldo Vacc√† Berlinghieri (1768‚Äì1809), was a noted Tuscan military figure. In 1787 he traveled to Paris with his brother in order to study medicine. Here he was a pupil to surgeon Pierre-Joseph Desault (1744‚Äì1795) and obstetrician Jean-Louis Baudelocque (1745‚Äì1810). Two years later he visited London, being interested in the surgical work of John Hunter (1728‚Äì1793). Following his return to Italy, he received his degree in medicine and surgery at the University of Pisa. In 1799 he revisited Paris, where he furthered his studies with Baudelocque, Philippe- Jean Pelletan (1747‚Äì1829), Alexis de Boyer (1757‚Äì1833), and Antoine Dubois (1756‚Äì1837). After his return to Pisa, he became a professor of surgery, an event that is considered to be the start of a new surgical tradition at Pisa. His reputation as a surgeon attracted patients from all over Europe to Pisa, including the Irish aristocrat Margaret King, who had to dress as a man to gain admission to the lectures.

The projects are: * Bank House Farm, Croft, North East Lincolnshire; * French Farm Extension, Thorney, Peterborough; * Grange Farm, Wiltshire; * M48, South Gloucestershire; * Mendennick, Cornwall; * St Breock Repower, Cornwall; * Steadfold Lane, Ketton, Rutland. *Old River Don, Crowle, Lincolnshire *Knockshinnoch, Rankinston, East Ayrshire *Langthwaite, Millom, Cumbria  Controversies  REG Windpower has attracted criticism over their selection of some of their development sites. * Old River Don wind farm - the site chosen for 6 turbines was the site of two World War II graves. A Lancaster bomber crashed in September 1945 and two Australian airmen were never found. The location of one of the turbines was to be close to where the crash site was believed to be. * Knockshinnoch Wind Farm - East Ayrshire Council Planning Committee granted consent for the site on 30 January 2015 despite an objection from West of Scotland Archaeology Service due to the existence of Carline Knowe, a prehistoric cairn sitting just a few metres from the base of the turbines. The site is located 200 metres from the edge of Dunstonhill surface mine which was abandoned following the collapse of Scottish Coal in April 2013. Many local residents were unhappy with further development in this area while Dunstonhill blighted the landscape. The site also sits just 488 metres from the nearest home despite Scottish Government Guidance recommending a minimum separation distance for this size of turbine (126.5 metres height) being 900 metres. In total 26 separate planning policies and guidance were breached however the Planning Committee overturned the advice of the Planning Department to refuse.

Description  The species is one of the largest tarantulas found in the United States, as it commonly reaches a leg span of 5 inches at full maturity with some females reaching a 6-inch span. Like most Aphonopelma species, it has a very slow growth rate and lives for several years before maturing. As in most tarantulas, females are massive as compared to the males with considerably more bulk. Males tend to have longer leg spans, a smaller body, and also have bulbs on the end of their pedipalps once they reach maturity. These are used for mating. As the name suggests, the coloration of A. anax primarily consists of tan colors and dark shades of brown. It is similar in coloration to Aphonopelma hentzi, another common Texas species, but is considerably darker. This species has urticating hairs like many New World tarantulas, but lacks any stridulating hairs on their chelicerae.Smith, Andrew (1994). Tarantula Spiders: Tarantulas of the US and Mexico. London: Fitzgerald Publishing. p. 95. . Distribution and habitat The Texas tan tarantula is found in Southeastern Texas, and has been documented in Cameron County and Kleberg County. They are also found in Northern Mexico.Hamilton, Chris A.; Hendrixson, Brent E.; Bond, Jason E. (2016). \\"Taxonomic revision of the tarantula genus Aphonopelma Pocock, 1901 (Araneae, Mygalomorphae, Theraphosidae) within the United States\\". ZooKeys (560): 1‚Äì340. doi:10.3897/zookeys.560.6264. ISSN 1313-2989. PMC 4768370. PMID 27006611. This puts their range in a semiarid climate, and they can be found in the grasslands and shrub forests that line the region, as well as within cities. This species, like most tarantulas, does not build a typical web and instead lives within a silk-lined burrow. These burrows may be created by the tarantula itself, but in the majority of cases, the tarantula will simply modify a preexisting burrow or other suitable habitat. These kinds of habitats can include dead trees, empty rodent burrows, stacks of wood, or natural crevices.Breene; et al. (1996). \\"Tarantulas of Texas: Their Medical Importance, and Worldwide Bibliography to the Family Theraphosidae\\". The American Tarantula Society: 5‚Äì6.  Life cycle  Females of A. anax can lay hundreds of eggs at a time. The eggs are laid within an egg sac weaved by the female, which is aggressively guarded within the burrow. The female also turns the egg sac to prevent deformations in a process called brooding. Eggs hatch after several weeks, and the spider-lings may stay with the females for some time before dispersing to fend for themselves. Females have been known to live up to 40 years. However, no studies have lasted this long, so the lifespan may be longer. Males rarely live over two years after they have matured.  Behavior   Relations with humans  A typical threat posture by a mature male. (note: not A. anax, but a similar species) Similar to many tarantula species, A. Anax is non-aggressive and avoids confrontations with humans and larger animals. This docile temperament makes it very desirable in the pet trade, along with A. hentzi. If provoked, however, the tarantula will use its hind legs to kick off some of its urticating hairs towards the potential threat. If these hairs reach the mucous membranes or bare skin, they can cause mild swelling and/or a rash. Humans may have an allergic skin reaction which can worsen symptoms. The reactions can last for several hours to weeks.Chao- Kai Hsu, Mark Ming-Long Hsur, Rick C. West, Yau-I Chu: Skin Injury Caused by Urticating Hair of Tarantula. Dermatologica Sinica. September 2007, S. 232-237 In addition to kicking its urticating hairs, A. Anax will rear up on its hind legs and raise its front legs in the typical tarantula \\"threat posture\\".Cott, Hugh B. (1940). Adaptive Coloration in Animals. London: Methuen. p. 215 This is done to intimidate a potential predator.  Mating behavior  A. anax follows the typical mating pattern of tarantulas. Once a male reaches maturity, it begins to weave a web in preparation of its journey to mate. It then rubs its abdomen on top of the web to release semen, which it then absorbs into the tips of its pedipalps. The semen is then kept viable until a mate has been found. When it detects a female, the two spiders then exchange different signals (usually a rhythmic drumming of the legs) to assure that they are the same species. If the female is willing to mate, the male will approach her, lift her upper body up, and then inserts his pedipalps into the female reproductive organ, the opisthosoma, which is located on the abdomen. After mating is complete, the male quickly leaves to avoid becoming a meal for the female. Females do not usually show aggression after mating, but it is known to happen.Fabre, Jean-Henri; Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (1916) \\"The Life of the Spider\\", Dodd, Mead, New York.

Located on the arterial Anna Salai, it was built in 1897. Originally known as Kardyl Building, the building is an example of the Indo-Saracenic architecture, a hybrid of Muslim design with Indian materials. The Madras High Court has stayed demolition of the building following a petition from heritage lovers. History The building with stained glass panels, domes, spires, arches, verandahs and 100-ft minarets was built in 1897. Once a lively commercial centre, it started deteriorating due to poor maintenance. The ownership changed several hands before it came under the possession of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in 1956. In 1998, tenants were asked to vacate the premises due to the weakness of the structure, and LIC planned to demolish the building in 2006. The Madras High Court stayed it after the Indian National Trust for Architectural and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) filed a public interest litigation. INTACH received an interim order to preserve the building. LIC appealed to the Supreme Court which referred the matter back to the Madras High Court. The High Court issued a comprehensive order in 2009, asking the state government to submit a report on the building and also form a conservation committee to handle protection of other heritage structures. The heritage committee said in its report to the High Court that the building should be preserved, reiterating its heritage value. Meanwhile, LIC filed a petition with the Supreme Court in 2010, citing a technical report to argue that the building is structurally unsound and that it should be allowed to redevelop the property so it will resemble the old building in design. It also stated that the building has not been listed as a heritage structure anywhere and proposed an eight-storeyed complex in its place. The government made an announcement in October 2010 about finalising a heritage bill. The Madras High Court in a landmark judgement in 2010 included the building in a set of 400-plus heritage structures that could not be demolished. The grade 'A' certification was also confirmed.

The script is based on the true story of the Battle of Kolwezi that happened in 1978. It was diligently described in a book of the same nameSERGENT Pierre, La l√©gion saute sur Kolwezi : op√©ration l√©opard, Presses de la Cit√©, Paris, 1979, Collection Troupes de choc (n¬∞ 17), 240 p., 24x15x2 cm, by former 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment Captain Pierre Sergent. He published his book in 1979, and the film came out in 1980. Coutard shot the film in a documentary style.  Synopsis  The film is based on true events. In 1978, approximately 3,000 heavily armed fighters from Katanga crossed the border to the Democratic Republic of Congo and marched into Kolwezi, a mining centre for copper and cobalt. They took 3,000 civilians as hostages. Within a few days, between 90 and 280 hostages were killed. The rebels appeared to be unpredictable and are reported to have threatened to annihilate all civilians. Mobutu, Congo's head of state, urged Belgium, France and the United States to help. France sent the Foreign Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, which were flown from Corsica to Kolwezi. Following their arrival, they secured the perimeter, in co-operation with Belgian soldiers from Zaire, and then started to evacuate the civilians. Within two days more than 2,000 Europeans and about 3,000 African citizens were saved. The film strives to depict the events in a dramatised form, concentrating on the Europeans' plight. Production The late Jean Seberg had filmed scenes on location for the film, but her death caused her to be replaced by another American actress, Mimsy Farmer, who reshot Seberg's scenes.

It is the site of a 225,000 hectare cattle station. p. 246 Mundabullangana is more commonly known as Munda Station. In 1872, brothers Roderick Louden MacKay and Donald McDonald MacKay, then their younger brother Donald MacKay and his son, Samuel Peter Mackay, took up a tract of country on the Yule River, where there was a good pool of permanent water, bearing the Aboriginal name Mundabullangana. Although for most of its history Mundabullangana was predominantly a sheep station, in 1985, long after it passed out of the MacKay family, it was destocked in favour of cattle. The station originally occupied an area of and by 1903, following the death of his father, Samuel Mackay became the sole owner of the station. Mundabullangana Station is significant in the occupation of the north-west of Western Australia as the first pastoral lease taken up by European settlers in the Yule and Turner River areas, in the 1870s. It became one of the largest and most successful enterprises of its kind in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and its pastoral use continued through the twentieth century, and into the twenty-first century. In 1898 the station recorded of rain following a cyclone in the area. The Aboriginal Australian workers on the station said the Yule River ran higher than ever before as a result of the deluge. In 1925 the property was sold by the MacKay estate for ¬£87,000, when it occupied an area of and was stocked with 35,000 sheep and 190 horses. It was acquired by the Craig brothers, who also owned Portree, Yalbago, Wandina and Maroonah Stations. The homestead at Mundabullangana Station is a good example of Victorian Georgian style architecture. On 2 March 1984, Mundabullangana homestead was entered on the Register of the National Estate. The nomination lapsed, and it was removed from the Register on 14 May 1991. The lessee in 2015 was Michael Thompson, who also grazes his cattle on neighbouring Boodarie Station. Following a series of incidences of poaching and arson in 2015 costing Thompson $100,000, he closed the gates to Mundabullangana and employed guards to keep the public out.

For most of his career he was a member of the New York Knickerbockers. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the shortstop position, which he used to field short throws from outfielders. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw bat production; he also occasionally acted as an umpire. From 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-inning games. When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' bases should be apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \\"bound rule\\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in The New York Times; by 1993, researcher John Thorn had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \\"first among the Fathers of Baseball\\". A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Medical School, Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the Connecticut legislature. He and his wife had five children. Early life Born in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, on November 1, 1814, Adams was the fourth of Daniel and Nancy Adams' five children. The elder Daniel Adams was a physician and author; he wrote a math textbook that was widely used in the United States in the early- to mid-1800s. After being schooled at Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire from 1826 to 1828 and Amherst, Massachusetts' Mount Pleasant Classical Institution, Adams attended three colleges from 1831 to 1838. He studied at Amherst College for two years, then transferred to Yale University, where he acquired a bachelor's degree upon his graduation in 1835. Nancy Adams, Daniel's sister, indicated in a letter penned in the early 1830s that he began playing with \\"bats and balls\\" by this time. Adams continued his studies at Harvard Medical School through 1838, obtaining an MD. Following his time in college, he joined his father's medical practice. The pair worked in Mont Vernon, before the younger Adams relocated twice, first to Boston and then to New York City. Adams also worked for the New York Dispensaries, which provided medical care to poor residents. He offered his assistance when outbreaks of cholera affected New York City. For providing vaccinations, Adams received yearly pay of $400 for a time. His field of employment gave rise to his nickname of \\"Doc\\", which was given as \\"Dock\\" at the time. Playing career According to baseball historian John Thorn, 1839 is the year Adams became a baseball player. In an 1896 interview in The Sporting News, Adams said that \\"soon after going to New York I began to play base ball just for exercise, with a number of other young medical men.\\" Starting in 1840, he was a player with the New York Base Ball Club. This team had been founded in 1837, eight years earlier than the New York Knickerbockers, who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering the modern version of baseball. Adams played an early form of the game, but Thorn writes that he \\"understood [it] to be baseball, no matter what it was called\\". The Knickerbockers during a practice session, as depicted by alt=A drawing of several members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team. One player is holding a baseball bat, while behind him three members are sitting or standing in front of a house. Adams received an invitation to become a member of the Knickerbockers a month or so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers. Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton, 51‚Äì42. The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19. Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23‚Äì1. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' lineup, he made one out and did not score a run. The Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week. According to Adams, he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games. Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21‚Äì11 and 22‚Äì20. No individual statistics are available for the first game; Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs in a pair of victories. The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game. After splitting the first two contests, their October 26, 1854, game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with the score tied 12‚Äì12; both teams fell short of the 21 runs that were required to win a game under the rules of the time. Following two November games against the Eagle Base Ball Club that Adams is not known to have participated in, he returned to the Knickerbockers' lineup for a June 1, 1855, game against Gotham and scored three times, although Gotham prevailed, 21‚Äì12. He took part in two other 1855 games against Eagle and Gotham, respectively, scoring five runs total as the Knickerbockers won both contests. Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once, lost twice, and had one tie; he scored ten times, and records for two games showed that his defensive position was shortstop. The Knickerbockers had a 2‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in. Playing three times at shortstop and once at first base defensively, he contributed 12 runs offensively, including a six-run effort in the Knickerbockers' 37‚Äì23 victory over the Empire club on June 24. In 1858, Adams made four appearances for the Knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs, but the team went 1‚Äì3 in the games. He varied his defensive positioning between second base, third base, and shortstop. Playing style alt=A diagram of a baseball field and defensive positions, with shortstop highlighted on the left side of the infield. As a player, Adams created the concept of the shortstop position, according to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher- quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps. Adams hit left-handed; he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by the Elysian Fields, the ground in Hoboken, New Jersey, where the Knickerbockers practiced and played. Adams had a long on-field career with the Knickerbockers; he remained a player with the team until 1859. He did not limit his play to shortstop; he fielded at every position except pitcher. Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players, and the game was largely recreational, as opposed to competitive. Thorn speculates that Adams may have been \\"the best player of the 1840s\\", citing his lengthy playing career as evidence. Equipment maker and umpire In addition to playing the game, Adams was involved in the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process. Adams also worked occasionally as an umpire in significant games. One notable example was the final contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29‚Äì18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who refused to swing when \\"good pitches\\" were thrown to them. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence. Knickerbockers and NABBP executive alt=Seven members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team standing on a field. They are wearing white shirts and dark pants. The Knickerbockers held elections annually to determine who would serve as officials. At the club's second election, held on May 5, 1846, Adams was named the Knickerbockers' vice president. At an April 1847 meeting, he became the president of the team, and was re-elected in 1848 and 1849. He was the leader of a \\"Committee to Revive the Constitution and By- Laws\\" of baseball in 1848. Adams was not chosen as an officer in 1851, but the next year was named one of the club's three treasurers; he was elected to the same position the following two years. The number of baseball teams in the New York City area started to grow during the early 1850s, as the Washington Base Ball Club (also known as the Gotham Ball Club) and Eagle Base Ball Club were founded or reorganized. The Eagle Base Ball Club, desiring a unified set of rules, sent a message to the Knickerbockers requesting that a committee be formed. Adams was one of the three Knickerbockers members selected to be on the committee, and the clubs agreed on a set of rules, which were presented at the Knickerbockers' meeting on April 1, 1854. At the same meeting, Adams was voted into the position of club director. After again being named a director in 1855, Adams became president of the Knickerbockers for the fourth time, winning an election held at the club's April 5, 1856, meeting. He remained the team's president in 1857, and after not being named as an officer the next three years, was elected president in 1861. During his time as the club's president, the Knickerbockers' organization was emulated by newly formed teams, and Adams himself was considered a \\"respected\\" figure by members of other clubs. According to author Andrew J. Schiff, Adams was among the most powerful baseball figures of the era. Concurrently, Adams maintained his New York City medical practice. Number of players and game length alt=Duncan Curry in a suit and bow tie. A supporter of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players from outside the Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13‚Äì11 vote, in favor of a rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team). A two-man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed. These changes were incorporated in the \\"Laws of Base Ball\\", written by Adams. He authored the initial draft of the regulations with what The New York Times' Richard Sandomir called \\"an upright script and strong hand.\\" The \\"Laws\\" included regulations governing bat and ball sizes, and a ban on betting by players and umpires. Fellow Knickerbocker William H. Grenelle copied Adams' work onto blue pages, and modifications and notations were made as the convention progressed. Among other changes, part of the rule Adams had written on game length was crossed out; the number nine was replaced with seven, before the motion that settled the issue was introduced. In March, the Knickerbockers changed their rules to match those passed at the convention. In May 1857, Adams presided over a player convention where nine-inning games were officially made part of the rules of baseball for participating teams. Distance between bases and campaign against bound rule In March 1858, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed at another convention. Adams was one of the Knickerbockers' two delegates, having been selected at a February meeting attended by representatives from 25 clubs. He held the chairmanship of the association's rules and regulations committee, and drafted the new organization's initial set of rules. These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between bases, which under Knickerbocker Rules had been set at \\"forty-two paces\\" between home plate and second base, and \\"forty-two paces, equidistant\\" between first and third base. Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly apart, or a shorter distance. Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been \\"an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off',\\" and Adams described the rule as \\"rather vague.\\" At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be \\"securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards.\\" As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them apart. In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm. It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games. Adams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball, involving when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this was known as the \\"bound rule\\". Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule \\"the fly-game\\". Under the style of play he backed, when a fly ball was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in cricket, and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders. The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the \\"fly-catch\\" by 1857. The Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention, with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for foul balls. Despite widespread support from sportswriters, the proposed rule change was voted down. Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \\"the limits of the Knickerbockers' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity.\\" The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass. At the 1858 NABBP convention, a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful. Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times. Despite his support for the fly rule, in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations, including outs on bounces, to apply to the Knickerbockers. He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP. Shortly after his motion, he organized a Knickerbockers meeting to discuss the fly rule and \\"obtain a reconsideration\\" of the newly passed resolution. At the meeting, the Knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported the fly rule. In future years, the club remained an advocate of eliminating the bound rule, but Adams' continued efforts were rejected. A split in the rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting the fly game at the NABBP's 1859 convention, and votes at the 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained the bound rule. Adams' final comments about the regulation at an NABBP convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified. The bound rule started losing support by 1863, after Adams left the Knickerbockers, and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864. Retirement In addition to his other roles, Adams regularly served as a delegate on behalf of the Knickerbockers at the NABBP's annual meetings. He remained with the Knickerbockers in an executive role until March 26, 1862, when he retired having served 12 years overall in various non-playing capacities. Upon leaving his position, the club named him an honorary member. He received a scroll from the Knickerbockers, which referred to him as \\"The Nestor of Ball Players\\", alluding to a mythical king known for offering advice. Adams also resigned from his role as rules committee chairman of the NABBP. Later life Adams and Cornelia Cook married in 1861, and remained together until Adams' death. The couple had five children; the first, a son named Charles, died less than a month after his birth in 1864. The others, two sons (Frank and Roger) and two daughters (Catharine and Mary), were born between 1866 and 1874. Adams continued to maintain his medical practice during his baseball career, but was forced to abandon it in 1865 after he began suffering health issues. After relocating to Ridgefield, Connecticut, he went on to become \\"one of the leading citizens of the Connecticut village,\\" according to author William J. Ryczek. Adams served as a Republican legislator in the Connecticut House of Representatives for the town in 1870. Site does not support direct linking. Search for \\"Adams\\" under \\"Last Name\\" to find results. He contributed to the creation of the Ridgefield Land Improvement Association, and to a committee overseeing construction of a town house. In 1871, he accepted a job with the Ridgefield Savings Bank (later renamed the Fairfield County Bank) as the company's first president. After working there until 1879, Adams took a break from his duties; during this time, he helped found Ridgefield's library and served as its treasurer. In 1884, he returned to the Ridgefield National Bank and remained president there until mid-1886. Adams and his family relocated to a house in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1888. Along with baseball, playing music was among Adams' favorite activities. Occasionally, he and Henry Ward Beecher performed flute duets. Although no longer actively involved in baseball, Adams was still a follower of the sport. He played in an exhibition as late as 1875, and stories exist that he played recreationally into the following decade. Late in his life, he said of the growth of baseball, \\"We pioneers never expected to see the game so universal as it has now become.\\" Adams contracted pneumonia following a bout of influenza, and died on January 3, 1899, at the age of 84. He was buried at New Haven's Evergreen Cemetery. Legacy alt=Abner Doubleday wearing an Army jacket. For decades after Adams' death, his role in codifying baseball's early rules was largely unremembered. Thorn included Adams among a group of \\"powerfully influential figures\\" from the period‚Äîalso including Louis F. Wadsworth and Wheaton‚Äîwho he writes \\"went unrecognized in their lifetimes and became mysteries to future generations.\\" Alexander Cartwright was more widely recognized as a pioneering figure for the sport. The Baseball Hall of Fame has claimed that Cartwright was the inventor of 90-foot (27 m) baselines and the nine-inning game. However, by the time conventions led by Adams had enacted those rules in the late 1850s, Cartwright had traveled to California and was no longer a member of the Knickerbockers. Adams is said to have avoided \\"campaigning for credit\\" for rules changes after he left the Knickerbockers; researcher Gary O'Maxfield said of him that he \\"didn't like to brag.\\" Several of the rules approved at the conventions survived to modern baseball, including the 90-foot (27 m) baseline distance. The 45-foot (14 m) distance from home plate to the pitching mound, however, did not last through the 19th century; it was pushed back in 1880. The shortstop position, which for Adams was located between the infielders and outfielders, was later played in the infield, between second and third base. Dickey Pearce was the first player to field in that area, and his ability to prevent base hits in the formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to employ similar tactics. The Hartford Courant points to 1980 as a year when Adams started to gain greater attention for his achievements. A share of the New York Mets was purchased by a publishing company led by Nelson Doubleday Jr. that year, and claims that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, which are considered flawed by modern researchers, were reported by the media. After the Doubleday reports in 1980, The New York Times received a letter from the great-great-grandson of Adams that the Courant said attempted \\"to try to set the record straight.\\" The newspaper ran the letter in its April 13 issue, and added a 1939 piece by Roger Adams. In 1993, Thorn published research on Adams' contributions in the encyclopedia Total Baseball. The New York Times published an article on Adams on September 23, 2015. Mont Vernon holds an annual baseball game in honor of Adams, which incorporates the rules of his era, as a part of the town's Lamson Farm Day. Various historians have given Adams recognition as an important figure from the early years of baseball. Thorn has written that he \\"may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball.\\" O'Maxfield said of Adams: \\"Without [him], we wouldn't have the game we know and love as baseball today.\\" The \\"father\\" label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a \\"collaborator\\" in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 \\"Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend\\". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, \\"Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together in the early part of baseball.\\" Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction. While Adams' contributions had received notice from historians, Associated Press writer Andrew Dalton called such reports \\"somewhat speculative\\" in nature before 2016. That year, the 1857 \\"Laws of Base Ball\\" authored by Adams were sold at an auction. The documents were included in a batch of historical papers that brought $12,000 in a 1999 sale. Adams' authorship of the papers was unknown at the time, but was confirmed after the owner brought the documents to the attention of an auction house in 2015. An anonymous buyer purchased the \\"Laws of Base Ball\\" in April 2016 for $3.26 million, the most a series of baseball documents had ever sold for.

The band was formed in 1990 as a punk rock project of a few students, but became one of the most successful Bosnian rock bands. The name of the band is translated as Buzz Off! From 1990 they changed line-ups many times, as well as musical styles. Their first songs were parodies of Yugoslavian pop songs. Sikter became the first band from Bosnia and Herzegovina whose video clip Pain In Brain was broadcast on MTV for several months. They recorded four albums: Now, Always, Never in 2000, Queen of the Disco in 2002, My Music in 2005 and Ego Trip in 2009. The album Now, Always, Never was produced by English musician Brian Eno.http://eno-web.co.uk/discog.html History Band Sikter was formed in spring 1990. in Sarajevo. It was created spontaneously at fresh party on Sarajevo Academy of Fine Arts. At the party was supposed to play pop rock band Regina but when they started to play, Enes Zlatar, Igor ƒåamo, Faris Arapoviƒá, and Davor ƒåoliƒá came to the stage and repelled Regina from stage with word Sikter which means Buzz Off and started to play. After that party band was formed and they played a parody of Yugoslavian pop songs with punk rock elements. First two years, the band didn't constant line-up and rehearsals so many musicians played in the band in a period of 1990-1992. By the beginning of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the band started the transformation from punk rock to alternative rock band but still with elements of punk. During the siege, Sarajevo had a large alternative scene and numerous club concerts. Sikter was one of the most active bands during that period. They performed on the Rock Under Siege concert in Sloga club organized by Radio ZID. In 1994, they performed as the opening act at Bruce Dickinson concert in Sarajevo. Also MTV made a reportage from their concert in Obala Arts Center in Sarajevo. In 1995 Haris Pa≈°oviƒá invites band members to join his theatre ensemble. During that time the team of journalists from BBC came to Sarajevo and started to hang out with the band members. They decided to record their first music video for the song Pain in Brain directed by Haris Pa≈°oviƒá. It was aired often on MTV UK during 1995. In April 1995 they came to London with the ensemble to perform on play Silk Drums on festival Memories 45-95 but under certain circumstances, ensemble didn't perform. Because Airport in Sarajevo was closed, ensemble can not be returned in Bosnia and Herzegovina so they must stay in London for a couple of weeks and after that, they went to Amsterdam and the band started to rehearse and play again. They have a lot of concerts in the Netherlands during 1995 and they met Brian Eno in one of the Amsterdam clubs. Dutch saxophonist Jan Kooper also joined the band. In July 1995, Vasco Rossi invites the band to play on his double concert Rock sotto l'assedio which held on San Siro stadium in Milano. After the end of the war, the band returns to Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1996 Vasco Rossi again invites them to join him on his tour across Italy. After Italy, they went on tour in Belgium, France, and the Czech Republic during 1996. By the end of 1996, they started to rehearse and play in Bosnia and planning their debut album. In 1997 they played on the U2 concert in Sarajevo as an opening act. They are invited to open Pavarotti Music Centre in Mostar and perform with Bono Vox, Jovanotti and Brian Eno. Also, they agreed with Brian Eno to come into Mostar and help them to record their debut album. They started to record in the spring 1998 and ended recording of the album by the end of 1998. The album Now, Always, Never was released two years after recording on 21 November 2000. Album was long- awaited in Bosnia and Herzegovina and has received a good reviews. It was distributed internationally by The Orchard. By the end of February 2002 band released a second album Queen of the Disco. Album was not well accepted because of the changing of musical style from alternative rock to disco music. During the 2004 they signed a contract with label Gramofon from Sarajevo which published their third album My Music and single \\"Don't You Miss Me\\". The album was supported with DVD My Documents which was released 2006. On the DVD was also released a film about the band I Was Dreaming About Smirnoff Buffalo directed by Timur Makareviƒá.

Drug charge at law school In 1993, while she was a law student, police raided a house owned by Gobbo and found amphetamines, marijuana, and weapons. Gobbo, her boyfriend, the drug dealer Brian Wilson, and another man were charged with drug possession and pleaded guilty. Gobbo was given a good behaviour bond. Two years later, another raid turned up more amphetamines. Gobbo was concerned that another drug conviction would destroy her law career. No charges were laid, and soon afterwards, she was registered as police informer G395.  1996 election scandal  Gobbo first came to public attention during the 1996 Australian federal election. In the last week of the campaign, Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis used letters purportedly from Jeff Kennett criticising Liberal leader John Howard. The letters were quickly exposed as forgeries. Gobbo, then a Young Labor member, publicly claimed that the forger was then-Liberal staffer and current Senate president Scott Ryan, who had intended for the forgery to pass initial inspection then rebound on Labor. Despite Gobbo‚Äôs signed statutory declaration, Ryan denied the claim.  Witness  Gobbo was a witness against Paul Dale, a former policeman accused of corruption. She asserted that Australian authorities have not fulfilled assurances made to her about protecting her safety. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation repeated that Gobbo asserted she had received death threats due to her planned testimony.  Lawyer X scandal  Between 1995 and 2009, Gobbo was a registered police informant, whilst also working as a defence lawyer for many of Melbourne's organised crime figures. She passed to Victoria Police information about her clients whilst representing them, leading to the prospect of many convictions being overturned. During media coverage of the scandal in 2018 and 2019, Gobbo's identity was subject to a suppression order, and she was referred to in the media only as Lawyer X or Informer 3838. The suppression order was lifted in December 2018 when it was reported that she had represented convicted criminals, Carl Williams and Tony Mokbel. On 3 December 2018, the Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews ordered the Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants. As part of its inquiry, the Royal Commission examined the number of, and extent to which, criminal cases may have been affected by the conduct of Gobbo. The Commission was due to report to the Government in July 2019.; however, as the inquiry proceeded it became clear that this timeline was not achievable. In May 2019 the Commission received $20 million in additional funding and a twelve-month extension to July 2020. In May 2019, it was reported that some of Gobbo's clients who received criminal convictions could be potentially overturned on appeal, on the basis that Gobbo may have provided information to police that led to the conviction of her clients; whilst at the same time representing her clients as their defence lawyer. At the time of lifting the suppression order to reveal Gobbo's identity, the High Court found that [Gobbo] covertly informing on [her] clients was a \\"fundamental and appalling breach\\" of the barrister's obligations. In handing down their decision on appeal from the Supreme Court of Victoria, Appeals Court, the judges commented:  Personal life  When the TV show Desperate Housewives first premiered in Australia in 2004, Gobbo was one of the prominent Australian women from whom The Age sought a reaction. Gobbo's partner is Richard Barkho; the couple have two children. , Barkho was serving a five-year custodial sentence for drug trafficking. Gobbo is the cousin of a Melbourne barrister, Jeremy Gobbo . She is also the niece of Sir James Gobbo , a former Governor of Victoria and a former Supreme Court judge. In popular media Gobbo's involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings has been dramatised in the Nine Network Australian television series Informer 3838, produced by Screentime, which premiered on 20 April 2020.

Its line up currently consists of MCs Alexandrah and Swamburger, poet Tonya Combs and producer/composer Divinci. Solillaquists utilize elements of melody and harmony in their vocals. The two lead vocalists also frequently employ a style of delivering many punctuated syllables in rapid succession sometimes in tight synchronicity. Most of their song lyrics feature socially conscious content based on life-affirming, justice oriented views held by the group. They have attracted a dedicated following in underground Hip Hop for their sophisticated musical compositions as well as their unique vocal delivery and politically aware lyrics. History The group formed in August 2002 in Orlando, Florida. Swamburger and Divinci met through a mutual friend and began recording tracks together. Swamburger had known and collaborated musically with Alexandrah in Chicago and often spoke of a desire to collaborate with her again. At the same time a group of poets and performers were beginning to congeal into a close-knit circle of friends at a local performance venue called Bodhisattva Social Club. This group of people included the poet Tonya Combs who subsequently became romantically involved with Divinci who was already calling himself the Solillaquist of Sound. The group of friends raised funds to visit Alexandrah in Chicago and they all spent time performing for and with each other becoming very energized by the results. Within a week of the group returning to Orlando Alexandrah left her jobs, tied up all of her loose ends in Chicago and drove to Orlando to continue the collaboration. The foursome quickly recorded a full album, 4 Student Counsol, and released it through Nonsense Records, a local Orlando based label before ever having performed in front of a live audience as a group. Divinci, who serves as the group's producer/composer, created hip hop beats in studio with an MPC player for the other group members to layer vocals over. In attempting to figure out how to translate that into a live performance the group went the route of obtaining more MPC players leading to an unusual live performance where Divinci employs three and sometimes four MPC devices weaving together a mixture of improvised electronic instrumentation and prerecorded sound samples in a very animated and impassioned fashion. The group received a phone call from fellow intellectual rapper Sage Francis who had been given a demo CD by Divinci. They performed at a fund raiser with him and were invited on tour where they served as his opening act and back-up band. The group was then signed to ANTI-/Epitaph. In June 2012 the group independently released The 4th Wall (Part 1) on their website. Collaborations The first single from their CD No More Heroes was a tribute to hip hop producer J Dilla called Death of the Muse. It featured J-Live, Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, and J Dilla's mother Maureen \\"Ma Dukes\\" Yancey. The track was made available for download in late 2008 with all proceeds going to J Dilla's mother. News of the tribute track ended up being one of the most viewed stories of 2008 on the prominent hip hop community okayplayer and was called \\"the most awesome song in the history of awesomedom\\" by LA Weekly. Solillaquists of Sound enlisted the aid of fellow Orlando-based artist and frequent collaborator X:144 to create videos for the songs \\"Marvel\\" and \\"Gotham City Chase Scene\\" with low budgets but high production values Image Solillaquists of Sound repeatedly utilize a comic book aesthetic in their album art, website and music videos. Through artistic depictions, cinematic music videos and energetic live performances the quartet exhibit and accentuate their diverse physical characteristics. For example, Alexandrah is unusual among female performers due to her complete baldness.

Adults of all seven species in this genus are phytophagous, feeding primarily on aquatic plants in the family Podostemaceae. The genus name Tometes was coined in 1850 by Valenciennes in reference to the incisiform teeth. When the type species of the genus, T. trilobatus, was described in 1850, it was placed in synonym with Myleus setiger, the type species of the genus Myleus, which is why Tometes and Myleus were considered to be the same genus for a long time. It was just later that the two genera were revalitated and other specimen could be categorized in the genus Tometes. Taxonomy Even today the taxonomic classification of the Serrasalmidae is not an easy task. Many names are placed in synonymy due to a lack of information and insufficient data bases. It was not long ago when it was discovered that Tometes and Myleus are two different genera but that Tometes, Myleus, Mylesinus and Ossubtus share a common ancestor. Typical characters of Tometes coincide with Mylesinus and Ossubtus specimen more than Myleus. It is further known that Tometes live in sympatry with other reophilic Serrasalmidae. Tometes species are also not to be mistaken with pacus, a vegetarian fish, which is often sold as a vegetarian piranha in the corresponding countries. One can easily distinguish one from another by their very different composition of their dentition. Description Depending on the exact species, the maximum length of Tometes is between . They can weigh more than . The body color is generally gray or silvery, showing a brighter color at the bottom side. Their name was given due to their incisiform teeth, which are thicker and lower than in the other related genera. Also the teeth are placed side by side, are weakly attached to the jaw and are primarily used for cutting leaves. Sexually mature male of Tometes differ from females by an additional anal-fin lobe, an elongated dorsal fin or a red pattern on the body. Range, habitat and ecology T. ancylorhynchus, T. kranponhah and T. siderocarajensis are found in clearwater rivers that originate in the Brazilian Shield (Xingu and Tocantins‚ÄîAraguaia basins), T. camunani, T. lebaili and T. trilobatus are found in rivers of the eastern Guiana Shield (Trombetas, Commewijne, Mana, Maroni, Oyapock, Amap√° Grande and Araguari basins), and T. makue is from the Rio Negro and Orinoco basins. These species all live in rapidly moving water with a rocky environment. A dense occurrence of Tometes larvae and juveniles in rapids around Podostemaceae plants, the main food source of adult Tometes, suggests that there is a positive rheotrophism (adaptability to fast-flowing water) in the larval stage. Unlike the strictly phytophagous adults, juveniles also feed on invertebrates. Their association with Podostemaceae plants restricts their distributions, which makes them vulnerable to the loss of rapids by the introduction of hydroelectric dams. In a cultural aspect rheophilic serrasalmids (notably Tometes, Myloplus and Mylesinus) are important in the tradition of local communities. Species There are currently 7 recognized species in this genus: * Tometes ancylorhynchus M. C. Andrade, J√©gu & Giarizzo, 2016Andrade, M.C., J√©gu, M. & Giarizzo, T.

Some are migratory. The largest species is up to in standard length, but most reach up to about of that size or less. They somewhat resemble larger, more elongated hatchetfish, including a keeled chest and large pectoral fins. This leads to the common names narrow hatchetfish and elongate hatchetfish, the latter also used more specifically for T. elongatus. Their shape is an adaption for living near the water surface where they find most of their food such as fruits, seeds, leaves, flowers, other plant material, invertebrates (insects, spiders and alike) and occasionally small fish. Seeds eaten by Triportheus are sometimes crushed, but may also pass undamaged through the fish, making them potential seed dispersers. Species There are currently 18 recognized species in this genus: * Triportheus albus Cope, 1872 * Triportheus angulatus (Spix & Agassiz, 1829) * Triportheus auritus (Valenciennes, 1850) * Triportheus brachipomus (Valenciennes, 1850) * Triportheus culter (Cope, 1872) * Triportheus curtus (Garman, 1890) * Triportheus elongatus (G√ºnther, 1864) (Elongate hatchetfish) * Triportheus guentheri (Garman, 1890) * Triportheus magdalenae (Steindachner, 1878) * Triportheus nematurus (Kner, 1858) * Triportheus orinocensis M.

Closure According to Texas Education Agency (TEA) spokesperson Debbie Ratcliffe, the charter school establishment process was, in 1995, simpler and less arduous compared to the 2015 process, and that therefore many of the earlier charter schools did not have the foundation to ultimately survive. Margaret Downing of the Houston Press wrote that establishing a charter school is \\"an ambitious enterprise for anyone\\" and that since the TEA inspectors meant to oversee the school were \\"overburdened\\", the school \\"didn‚Äôt even get the minimal oversight a school chartered to a local school district would get ‚Äî little attention was being paid to the school as matters continued to spiral out of control.\\" The school's final president of the school's board of directors, Peter Clark, stated that the school had $600,000 in debt in March 2014. Margaret Downing of the Houston Press stated that \\"According to some\\" the school destroyed its financial stability by trying to purchase property, as it was trying to avoid significant expenses in renting property. In December 2014, the TEA announced that the school's performance was insufficient, with a failing academic grade in the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, and that it had insufficient financial performance levels in the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 school years. The agency sought to revoke its charter, and even though the school administration attempted to relieve itself of the debt in attempt to ward off the order, the TEA announced that its revocation was permanent. Ratcliffe stated that the school frequently faced financial problems and instability, and that the agency had on two occasions each attempted to correct it with conservators and monitors, respectively. Of the Houston-area charters the TEA was seeking to close that year, Girls and Boys was the largest. In August 2015 the school owed $157,835 in interest and back taxes from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); The school system closed in August 2015; area parents stated that school officials had promised that the school would still continue, but it ultimately did not. Creditors filed lawsuits against the school upon the closure. The mid-September 2015 balance owed to the IRS was down to $7,148, as Clark stated that the IRS reduced the money owed. Downing concluded that GBPA \\"ultimately sank under the weight of those ambitions in a manner both very public and profound\\". Campuses In 2014 it had three campuses. 8282 Bissonnet Street was the address of the primary campus. One of its other campuses was 8415 West Bellfort. Its campuses were in Brays Oaks and Sharpstown. 11851 South Gessner was to be the school's new campus. In its lifetime the school frequently switched locations. Curriculum The school did not get a standard curriculum until 2008, when the board of directors adopted the one based on that of the Fort Bend Independent School District (FBISD). Demographics Its peak population was 750. In 2012 85% of the students were black and fewer than 13% were Hispanic or Latino. Of the peak population, 90% were classified as economically disadvantaged as they were signed up for free or reduced lunches. In 1997 the school had about 350 students in grades 6 through 12. Most of them were African American.

Michael Juvinall of the Horror Society liked it - \\"a clever mix of horror and humor\\" - with the proviso, \\"We don't see too much of the werewolf in the film and what we do see is CGI, which was a little disappointing for me.\\" A reviewer for GMA News Online was also mostly positive: \\"Add a generous tone of comedy to this naughty UK horror movie and what you've got are well-sketched characters and great plot potential that, unfortunately, just drags in the execution.

The site lies in the Bastion Hills close to the town of Wyndham, a port on the West Arm of the Cambridge Gulf. It is an important site for Gouldian finches. Description The site is characterised by gently sloping ranges, vegetated with tropical savanna woodlands and grasslands, with sandstone outcrops. The woodland has a high density of cavity-bearing old-growth eucalypts suitable as finch nest- sites; the grassland provides food for the birds; and the proximity of Wyndham provides reliable sources of drinking water. The area has a tropical monsoon climate with a mean minimum temperature of 17 ¬∞C in July, a mean maximum of 40 ¬∞C in November, with the mean annual rainfall of 780 mm falling mainly from November to March.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Wyndham. Downloaded from on 2011-12-03. Birds The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports the largest known population of endangered Gouldian finches. It also contains populations of, northern rosellas, white-gaped, yellow-tinted and bar-breasted honeyeaters, silver-crowned friarbirds, masked and long- tailed finches and yellow-rumped munias.  Finch trapping  Eleven Estrildidae finch in the Family Ploceidae are distributed in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Commercial finch trapping in the Kimberley, principally around Wyndham, commenced in 1897. By 1901 finches were trapped around Wyndham and shipped overseas to Europe in consignments of approximately 5,000 by the persons trapping them. All Kimberley finches were partially or fully protected from 1902 under the Western Australian Game Act, 1892. Commonwealth Customs regulations first introduced in 1911 failed to curb large scale exports by private finch traders until 1932. One of the largest commercial traders of wild caught Kimberley finches in the late 1920s and 1930s was the South Perth Zoo which exploited customs' law to export for 'scientific and educational purposes'. Licenses to trap finches in the Kimberley were first issued in or after 1913 and continued until 15 November 1986 when finch trapping was banned by Barry Hodge, the environment minister. Trapping of certain finches ceased before 1986: the yellow-rumped mannikin after 15 November 1975 because of its scarcity; the zebra finch after 15 November 1981 because sufficient numbers were sourced from breeding stocks; and the Gouldian finch after 15 November 1981 because of its decline in numbers. Customs regulations in 1960 prohibited the export of live Australian fauna for commercial purposes and strict standards were applied to exports of specimens of native fauna for scientific research or zoological display. In 1971 Australia became a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 1976 Australia introduced the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations to enforce import and export of species covered by CITES.Finch Trapping in the Kimberley, K H Coate and L H Merritt (2015) References Category:Kimberley (Western Australia) Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands Category:Important Bird Areas of Western Australia ","title":"Wyndham Important Bird Area"},{"id":"33940574","text":"Mar√≠a Paz Azagra Navascues (born 23 August 1982), commonly known as Mari Paz, is a former Spanish football midfielder.

Australian distribution, which is correlated to depth and temperature, ranges from a latitude as far north as approximately 27¬∞ S on the west coast, southwards, then eastwards on the south coast to a longitude of at least 129¬∞ E. The species usually occurs in waters with temperatures of and in depths ranging of on the lower west coast and on the south coast. Body size is inversely related to depth of water. There are only two species in the genus Hypothalassia, and H. acerba is not the same champagne crab as the other Hypothalassia species, H. armata, which is found in Japanese waters. Description The species has well-defined groves on a hexagonal carapace, with a smooth dorsal surface and a spiny anterior surface. Carapace width is 150 mm. Their branchial openings are partially covered by maxillipeds, and have asymmetrical chelipeds with stiff, brown-black spines of various sizes on their walking legs. The frontal region is beige-cream and covered in many short setae. Walking legs have a dactylus of 3.7‚Äì4.3 times as long as wide. Ecology Although life history is not very well known, some data has been collected on reproduction. Hypothalassia acerba reproduction is highly correlated with seasons, due to water temperature fluctuations. Oviposition primarily occurs in the summer between January and March. Females have a tendency to migrate from the south coast eastwards and then northwards to spawn on the lower west coast. The fecundity of this species may be due to its relatively short breeding season, therefore adapting to optimize egg production. Hall et al. (2004) propose that the larvae of this species is planktonic, and is therefore probably carried away from the lower west coast by the Leeuwin Current. Negligible reproduction occurs on the south coast, where maturity is delayed. Capture Hypothalassia acerba was first discovered to have a fishery potential in 1966. Most Hypothalassia acerba are primarily exported to the Chinese market. They are fished using baited traps placed at water depths of in southern and western waters off the coast of Australia. Females with eggs are strictly prohibited from fishing. Females have a tendency to be smaller than males, and thus males are more prevalent in catches than females. Fifty percent size at sexual maturity has been estimated at and is therefore used as the minimum catch size to aid in sustainable stock levels. This estimation may be considerably underestimated due to fishing biases. Between the years 1997 and 1999, champagne crab catch rates escalated to between 30 and 45 tonnes. After the year 2000, stocks dropped to negligible levels which was partially due to a decline in stock as well as a greater demand for another deep-sea crab, Chaceon bicolor. Therefore, management of champagne crabs is now primarily focused on safeguarding the biological sustainability of H. acerba and maintaining breeding stocks rather than establishing a viable commercial fishery on the west coast.

History Aristoi Classical Academy in Katy, Texas is a second-generation public charter school in its 23rd year of operations as of 2019. The school opened in 1996 as \\"West Houston Charter School\\" with an emphasis on fine arts. In 2006, there were many unfilled seats. The school's K-8 enrollment was under 200 students. The original model focused on catering to each student's preferred learning style or styles, with different content for auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learners, respectively.Berryhill, Michael. \\"Think Small.\\" Houston Press. Thursday August 15, 1996. 1. Retrieved on December 2, 2011. After careful deliberation, the school's board of directors voted to transition to a classical school model, an educational option previously available only in area private schools. Enrollment began to increase as families began to seek a tuition-free classical education. In 2010, the school's name was changed. \\"Aristoi\\" (·ºÑœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ) is a Greek term referring to nobility. The school's mission is to \\"provide students with an academically challenging Classical Liberal Arts education that encourages them to develop a passion for learning that gives them the means to become responsible citizens of virtuous character.\\" ACA uses the trivium to organize the stages of learning based on a child's natural stages of intellectual development. The grammar stage (K-4th grade) aims to provide a thorough foundation in phonics, spelling, grammar, literature, vocabulary, history, biology, and basic mathematics. The logic stage (5th-8th grade) focuses on higher-level mathematics and the application of logic to all subjects (e.g., paragraph construction, thesis writing, textual analyses, the scientific method, and historical questions). In addition, the rudimentary skills necessary in logical argument and debate are fostered in this stage. In the rhetoric stage (9th-12th grades), students learn to write at a collegiate level, speak eloquently, and defend original ideas. One of main purposes of this stage is to make public speaking second-nature. Seniors write and publicly defend a thesis as a requirement of graduation. The open-enrollment charter school has become enormously popular in the Katy community. Once permission to add a high school was granted by the state, 9th grade was added in 2014, with a new grade level added each subsequent year. The 2016-17 school year opened with 761 students in grades K-11 and a waiting list totaling 258. In 2018, ACA celebrated its first graduating class. ACA students scored impressively on the 2016 STAAR test. In high school, for example, 100% of ACA students earned Level II (satisfactory) scores for English I, compared to 62% statewide. Similarly, ACA scores for Algebra 1, Biology, and English II were 93%, 95%, and 90%, respectively, compared to statewide scores of 68%, 49%, and 63%. The school outgrew its small campus in historic Katy and had to lease additional space to serve the growing student body. Therefore, 22.16 acres of land was purchased on Morton Road (Katy) to build a K-12 campus. The first phase included a multipurpose facility with a gymnasium, stage, offices, restrooms, locker rooms, an adjacent kitchen and service area, and three modular buildings with space for twelve classrooms each. An athletic field being constructed on the northeast corner of the property will be used for sports and physical education programs. Limitations of charter school funding create financial challenges that traditional public schools do not face. For example, charter schools receive less funding per student as they are ineligible for local tax revenue, and they receive zero funding for facilities. Thus, ACA must rely on philanthropic support in its ambitious efforts to provide children in Katy and West Houston with a classical education and suitable learning environment. In May 2019, Brenda Davidson, the school's superintendent, announced Dr. Terrence O. Moore as the new Headmaster after Matthew Watson serving in the position for five years to develop the high school. On October 18, 2019, Dr. Moore ‚Äútendered his resignation‚Äù as Headmaster. Kathryn Locheed took his place as the interim Head of Upper School. Campus Aristoi Classical Academy has two campuses. Aristoi's Main Campus (5618 Eleventh St.) houses the school's elementary grades‚ÄîKindergarten through 4th Grade. The Morton Road Campus (5610 Morton Rd.) houses 5th through 12th Grades, and the district offices. On December 21, 2018, it was announced that Aristoi will create a campus based in Crossover Bible Fellowship as an effort expand into the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District area. Curriculum Aristoi Classical Academy uses a classical curriculum. The substance of the curriculum traces its roots to ancient Greece and Rome, the civilizations that Aristoi sees as the first to systematically explore the meaning of human existence. The school sees the literature, poetry, philosophy, and political experience of those ancient cultures serve as the foundation of Western civilization and form the basis of classical education. The classical education Aristoi employs aims to recognize ‚Äúthe experiences of historical peoples and societies as a rich source of wisdom for the present.\\" With the exception of Latin, much of the scope and sequence cited below is taken from the Core Knowledge Sequence‚Äînot to be confused with the Common Core standards prohibited in Texas schools. As a public charter school, Aristoi also teaches all subjects and topics required by the State of Texas. For example, while all public schools are required to offer basic \\"social studies,\\" ACA offers that as required in addition to an expanded history of the world and the United States in all grades. This is the classical education method of covering an important subject the school believes is at the depth appropriate for the child's development. Younger students learn basic facts‚Äîsuch as when the Civil War was fought a who fought‚Äîwhile older students learn comprehensive details, such as why the Civil War was fought and how it shaped America's future. Dress-Code Students in grades K-5 wear gray or yellow polo shirts, navy bottoms, white socks and solid-white tennis shoes. In grades 6-8, students wear gray or yellow polo shirts, navy bottoms, and black dress shoes. High school students wear white shirts (polo or button-down), navy or khaki bottoms, and black dress shoes. On Fridays, students may wear school-approved spirit-wear and tennis shoes. The detailed dress code policy can be found at this link: Aristoi Classical Academy - Student Dress Code. The school has casual dress guidelines on days that it is offered. These are typically at the end of each quarter, if the student has had no dress code violations in said quarter. They are also sold on select months for one day.

They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds.Cadogan, 276 Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage,Jones and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown.Cadogan, 276 It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence.Old Man with a Young Boy, Louvre The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.Old Man with a Young Boy, Louvre An extraordinary feature of the painting is the deformity of the man's nose, evidence of rhinophyma. Ghirlandaio has presented the portrait in a naturalistic and sympathetic fashion, at variance with physiognomic theory of the era, which maintained a connection between external appearances and internal truths.Cadogan, 276 Rather than implying a defect of character, An Old Man and his Grandson invites appreciation of the man's virtuousness. The painting depicts a moment of intimacy between an old man and a child, underscored by the placement of the child's hand on the man's chest, and the man's gentle expression. This show of affection endows the picture with emotional qualities beyond those expected from a traditional dynastic portrait.Cadogan, 277 In the words of art historian Bernard Berenson, \\"There is no more human picture in the entire range of Quattrocento painting, whether in or out of Italy.\\"Berenson, 192 The painting's provenance is uncertain until 1880, when it entered the Louvre, and then only after it was rejected by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin out of concern for its condition.Cadogan, 276 Several commentators in the late 19th century reported that the picture had been abraded by overcleaning, and there were disfiguring scratches on the man's face.Cadogan, 276 In 1996 the scratches and areas of discolored inpainting were removed, and the painting was cleaned and retouched.Cadogan, 276 A drawing by Ghirlandaio entitled Head of an Old Man, once owned by Giorgio Vasari, portrays the same man as in the painting. The drawing may have been made while the sitter was asleep, or after his death, in which case it would have served as a graphic death mask.Cadogan, 304 Notes References *Berenson, Bernard.

A number of notable people have lived here, including Hannah Arendt, Grace Zia Chu (culinary figure), Clarence J. Lebel (inventor of fluorescent bulb), and Evelyn John Strachey (British politician), among others. History The building at 370 Riverside Drive was erected in 1922 and 1923 for approximately $800,000. The architects were Simon Schwartz and Arthur Gross. It is located on a hill overlooking the Hudson River, and the Riverside Park. As a pre-war building its floor plans included a number of Classic Six apartments with high ceilings, a roof deck with views of the river, the park and George Washington Bridge. It is close to Columbia University campus. The 16 story building was completed in 1922 and converted to a cooperative in 1973. The building changed ownership a number of times. On September 4, 1944 Samuel Knepper acquired 370 RSD from Pasquale Ferri. The price was not disclosed, but the building had a mortgage of $530,000 and was assessed at $650,000. On November 1, 1944, an investor bought 370 Riverside Drive still assessed at $650,000. On January 27, 1949, it was reported that the US Attorney's office had brought involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against Samuel Bronxmeyer, who was the owner of 370 Riverside Drive. He was charged with milking bankers and other parties by use of his many properties, including the building where he lived. By August 11, 1949, Henry Payson purchased 370 Riverside Drive from H. B. Management Corporation for cash above a $489,000 mortgage. The property was assessed at $605,000. H. B.Management acquired the parcel through foreclosure proceedings on August 3 against Samuel Bronxmeyer. On January 9, the Jason Realty Company bought the rent-controlled 75-apartment 370 Riverside Drive from the estate of Joseph Ross for an undisclosed amount of cash over a $600,000 mortgage. The building sits on an irregular 160 by 71 foot plot with an assessment of $625,000. The building was incorporated as a cooperative apartment building in 1973. The building is particularly notable, being mentioned in The New York Times 68 times.

Following the death of 10-year-old Louis XVII on 8 June 1795, he was responsible for performing the autopsy. In 1804 Jean-Nicolas Corvisart (1755‚Äì1821) had Pelletan appointed consultant-surgeon to the Emperor.

Soviet First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev had sent a letter to U.S. President Ford on December 25, warning that the amendment was unacceptable. The amendment had the opposite effect, with Jewish emigration decreasing by 35% between 1974 and 1975.Robert G. Kaufman, Henry M.

Considered the longest continuous production in film's history, 12 is also the first film to use the aging of its actors as a practical effect. The film received acclaim from such notable publications as Variety, Shoot, and The Los Angeles Times, while playing at over 15 festivals worldwide. Synopsis The film is a postmodern spoof that tells the story of Zeus' modern day illegitimate children, Filmore (Tony Griffin) and his half-sister Marie-Noel (Alison Elliott), who are forced to move from their Channel Island ranch because their neighbors have grown suspicious of the fact they haven't aged for decades. Meanwhile, the U.S. government wants to turn their land into a national park. When the twelve Greek Gods return to Los Angeles for relaxation Zeus expects them to correctly identify the play fated and modeled around their current lives‚ÄîOscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest‚Äîand perform the work flawlessly, in its entirety, for the Gods' entertainment. By such means, as the play's plot unfolds, the children are guaranteed new, credible lives. \\"Act or die,\\" he commands. But if they fail to perform the play to its conclusion, or if they rebel, they will be killed by jealous Hera. The mere existence of these illegitimate children are an outrage to her, representing Zeus' countless infidelities. 12‚Äîwhose title is often mistakenly derived from the number of years it took to create the film (10 actually)‚Äîis described by Variety as \\"equal parts L.A. love story, The Importance of Being Earnest, spoof on Greek gods and personal diary of actual events from 1988 to 1998.\\" The director used more than of film. Cast Production Shot over the course of a decade, Bridges filmed 12 whenever the actors were available and \\"never imposed a deadline\\" on the project. Throughout the course of shooting, Bridges captured footage of natural disasters and major political events, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Malibu fires, four lunar eclipses and two eclipses of the sun and the Rodney King riots, which were all included in the film. Bridges explained, \\"My camera was always loaded and the batteries charged and often it traveled with me in my car to and from work. When there was a disaster, I was always ready to document it.\\" In a rare twist of fate, nearly all of the original actors cast participated in the entire shoot, despite some road blocks along the way. While on a separate commercial shoot in Minneapolis, Allen Lulu suffered a heart attack caused by Phen-Phen. Additionally, Golde Starger' was diagnosed with cancer in the middle of the shoot, and thankfully, recovered. \\"There were divorces and there were babies born. I guess when you look at all the things that could have gone wrong and didn't, I'm a very lucky man,\\" Bridges told Indie Slate. Additionally, Bridges adopted a flexible mentality in regards to continuity. As the actors aged and evolved, the one factor that remained semi-constant was wardrobe. For example, Griffin, who played Filmore, wore the same suite for 10 years. Dramatic hair and weight change was even accounted for in the storyline. The film was shot on 35mm Kodak short ends using Arri cameras and Zeiss Superspeed prime lenses. The short ends were stock test samples from 1989-1999. The production used minimal on-set lighting, mostly opting for available light. The camera dolly used throughout the production of the film was actually a homemade dolly that Bridges converted from a baby stroller. Themes 12 explores a variety of themes and attitudes that relate to a postmodern perspective on Greek mythology set within modern day Los Angeles. The idea of juxtaposition‚ÄîOscar Wilde / Greek mythology, mortals/immortals, grand scenery/run down Los Angeles streets is evidenced throughout. As Bridges himself states, \\"12 is a diary of L.A., a cinematic record of the natural and political convulsions gripping our town during the late-1980s and into the millennium.\\" Bridges explained his rationale in making 12 to Shoot saying,\\"Being the filmmaker, I clearly am defining myself as a radical independent. That's why I made the film. It's anti-everything in Hollywood. Not because of Hollywood--this is what I would do under any circumstance. I'm in love with the aesthetic, poetic and literary potential of film, and that's what I wanted to express.\\" Style More than its plot and themes, 12 is recognized for its unique‚Äîand rarely before seen‚Äîstyle. Drawing inspiration from French New Wave films, poetry and improvisation techniques, Bridges' film is inconsistent in tone, which some believe occurred because of the large span of time in which it was produced. One journalist described 12 as \\"shifting capriciously between the near- profound and the pointlessly silly.\\" The first half of the film especially has been considered nonlinear in regards to its narrative structure. Music None of the music in 12 was original score, yet the film incorporated over 100 different cues of music. More than 60 of those cues were classical in nature, incorporating Mozart, Beethoven, Bach and the like. Also of note is the fact that 12 is the first film for which the composer John Adams has allowed his music to be used. Distribution and publicity Just as the film blurs the boundaries of life and art, so does its distribution. 12 is shown via guerrilla drive-ins, a movement the filmmaker created, which entails projecting the piece on walls of buildings throughout Los Angeles and instructing viewers to tune their car radios to a specified station. Locations have included a Staples store on Sunset Boulevard, a parking lot behind the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood offices and a parking lot near a Sportmart in West Los Angeles, to name a few. Bridges said he created the guerrilla drive-in in an effort to \\"paint the artwork back on the subject of its inception -- projecting what you filmed back on to the wall at night.\\" Although the film was an out of pocket expense for Bridges, he has said he is \\"waiting for the audience to find it, in terms of the marketplace,\\" but also considers 12 to be public art that was privately funded. In 2002, Bridges began a grassroots effort to be considered for Academy awards and passed out 12 T-shirts to members of the Academy. However, police mistook him as a street vagrant and had him taken into custody. Coincidentally, the Los Angeles Times caught the incident on camera and published an image of Bridges being arrested wearing the '12 for Best Picture' shirt. Critical reception Although it never saw commercial success, 12 is considered an underground cult film that has played at more than 15 festivals worldwide and was honored with a \\"Best of Fest\\" award at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival in 2004. It is critically acclaimed for its unique production process, complex and current themes and stunning visuals. LA Weekly film critic Paul Malcolm praised the filmmaker's inventive nature, writing, \\"Bridges, a director of television commercials, has a feel for transformative compositions that can remake even the most familiar environment -- a kitchen pantry, a corner on Wilshire Boulevard -- into a place of wonder.\\" Variety reviewer Robert Koehler applauded Bridges for his \\"dizzying, unforgettable adventure,\\" writing, \\"Griffin and Elliott provide a good grounding for the viewer's attention as the deconstructed stream of images and story roll by, but much of the fascination here is not in the highly uneven perfs, but in pic's raw enthusiasm for the film medium, montage, the juxtaposition of image and sound and the reimagining of Greek classicism in a SoCal setting.\\" Tod Booth of the San Francisco Film Society called 12 \\"ambitious, discursive and hilarious\\" and described the film to be \\"as challenging and sweeping as a Pynchon novel-a Marx Brothers version of a Wagnerian opera, with Jean-Luc Godard mixed in.\\" SF Indiefest 2003 In his monthly Media Matters column on Hollywood Network, Miles Beller wrote, \\"12 is by turns funny and infuriating, loony and inspire. Here is a movie that juggles actualities and artifice with manic glee. [...] [Bridges'] 12 is a daring, new vision of the human condition, a work of art that sublimely shows the folly and fulfillment of the ascent of man.\\" References External links * * Category:2003 films Category:2003 comedy films Category:2003 independent films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American independent films Category:Films based on Greco-Roman mythology Category:Films directed by Lawrence Bridges Category:Films set in Los Angeles ","title":"12 (2003 film)"},{"id":"33940780","text":"Lloyd Borden Waring (born July 13, 1902, died October 30, 1997 in Rockport, Massachusetts) was an American investment banker and political figure who served as vice president of Kidder, Peabody & Co. and chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party.

He is one of the greatest, but also one of the most controversial, personalities in the history of Hungarian zoology because of his Social Darwinist and racialist publications. He had been a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences but renounced his membership. Besides his zoological work he increasingly dedicated his life to the Hungarian racial theory and Turanism. As a result, he was imprisoned after the Second World War and spent his punishment as a war criminal against the people until his death in old age. Life M√©hel√ø was born in Kisfalud-Sz√∂gi (today: Bodrogkisfalud). His father served as a bailiff on the Dessewffy estates in Zempl√©n then S√°ros County. He started elementary school in his birthplace then finished fourth grade in Kassa (today: Kosice, Slovakia). He began the first class of grammar school in Eperjes (today: Pre≈°ov, Slovakia) but graduated from L≈ëcse (today: Levoƒça, Slovakia). He studied chemistry, zoology, and botany at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME). After finishing his studies he worked as an assistant professor beside J√°nos Kriesch, one of his former teachers. After that he taught in Brass√≥ (today: Bra»ôov, Romania) between 1885 and 1896. Here were born his first great works. From 1896 to 1915 he worked for the Department of Zoology in the Hungarian National Museum, and he was the director of the collection of mounted specimens for the last three years. This position was exchanged for his academic teacher's desk until his retirement in 1932. He taught general zoology and comparative anatomy at the Department of Zoology of the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University. He was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) between 1899 and 1931. After the First World War he expanded his Darwinist approach to the human sciences and started dealing with racialist biology. He had devoted his life to this idea, increasingly tightened into the background his former zoological activity. After WW2 he was sentenced to life imprisonment by a People's Tribunal in 1945.

During her tenure, Clusen was instrumental in bringing issues relating to the environment to national attention. She was especially concerned with water purity, a fixation that stemmed from her time spent in Green Bay where water contamination was a problem. Additionally, Clusen fought for women's rights. She was a leading figure in the League's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to ratify an equal rights amendment for women.

The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.

IPO Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and \\"let the storm pass\\", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date. In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire. While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015. On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015. On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. Trading activity Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries. Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments. On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field. When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made a profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day. Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity. In the debate about its near-perfect trading record, Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses. In his research, Laughlin showed that \\"the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses\\", indicating Virtu assumes little market risk. Investigations In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running. In July 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies. The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices. A settlement was announced in 2017.http://www.newsweek.com/wall-street-firm-trump-army-secretary-nominee- violated-trading-rules-538630 John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.

Return of results is particularly discussed in the field of biobanks, where a typical case would be that many members of a community donate biobank specimens for medical research. In the course of the research, especially in human genomics research, scientists may discover personal health information which could influence the behavior of specimen donors if they had this information. For different cases, there are arguments for and against revealing study information to participants and in many cases the morally correct choice is not self-evident. Example situation The following example shows some possible outcomes of trying to fulfill the return of results in genomic research. this example is a restatement of examples given in the article A healthy person donates a biological specimen and agrees to have that specimen and associated data put into a genome-wide association study. The goal of the study would be something unrelated to the donor's identified interests, and may be, for example, to build the base of fundamental research or to study rare disease. The sample is stored for years. Later a researcher gets access to data from the sample, and this data has been de-identified so that the researcher can use the data without invading the research participant's privacy. This researcher finds that the donor's specimen displays biomarkers which indicate that the person is at risk for developing a genetic disease. If an individual's personal physician had this genetic information, the standard of care might be to take action. One outcome of this scenario could be that the researcher contacts the specimen donor, gives this information, and the donor is more informed and happy for this. Another outcome of this situation is that the researcher may not be a medical doctor, and in any case, it is not usual for a person to receive a diagnosis outside of a doctor-patient relationship. Even if the participant understands that the information is not a diagnosis, it can be confusing to know what to do when getting health information from an unknown person. Even if the researcher ought to tell the specimen donor about this development, it may not be the case that the researcher has the means to contact the participant because time has passed since the sample was collected and the means of contacting the participant may be unknown because there are research protections in place to prevent researchers from knowing the identity of the donor for the donor's own sake and right to privacy. The donor, for whatever reason, may not even want to know about a genetic problem, and may find the information unwelcome if tracked and informed. In addition to these stated problems, other problems can arise. Return of individual results There is debate as to whether researchers should give participants in research studies individual results based on their contribution to the study. Some perspectives say that researchers should give individuals all information while others say that researchers generally should not offer this. Arguments in favor Proponents of offering individual results most often cite \\"respect for persons\\" as the ethical basis for this practice. The following reasons support this argument: some studies have shown that participants want such results; returning results is a way of demonstrating respect to for donors' contributions to research; research results, and especially genetic data, can be valuable information for individuals; and when participants have access to more information about themselves it increases their personal autonomy. Aside from medical health, having access to information may have social meaning to participants such as solidifying a cultural identity, membership in an ethnic group, or identifying a non-paternity event. Arguments against The definition of research is a major argument against offering research results. Research is not treatment and guidelines including the Belmont Report distinguish between \\"clinical practice\\" which has the goal of improving an individual's health and \\"research\\" which has the goal of developing general knowledge. Researchers must take care to not allow participants to be confused as to whether they are participating in research or receiving personal clinical care; a researcher is not a study participant's personal health advisor. Study participants often have a tendency to perceive researchers as their physicians and research as personal treatment designed to benefit them. When participants get information from researchers they may interpret it as health advice. The nature of the results is problematic as well. Research data is often not comprehensible to participants and no one would want them to take health action based on unsubstantiated misinterpretations of the data. Alternate uses of term \\"Return of results\\" usually refers to the return of study data of personal or community interest to participants. Research may result in other products besides data, such as the development of commercially valuable product which was a research goal. When the term \\"return of results\\" is used, it usually does not refer to the return of results of research (such as profit generated) other than an explanation of what the research showed. The debate about non-informational study results being returned is discussed as \\"ownership of results\\" or under other headings. Issues relating to return of results There is no universally recognized authoritative policy on whether or how researchers should return results to research participants, and the views and practices of researchers in the field vary widely. Research In September 2011 the National Human Genome Research Institute awarded grants totaling USD 5.7 million to study ethics relating to the return of results.

Life and career Joe Davis was born in New York City. In the late 1910s and 1920s he worked as a songwriter and singer who recorded for Columbia Records. In the mid-1920s he had been responsible for placing dozens of blues and pop singers under his management with major and minor labels, while pursuing a radio and recording career as \\"Joe Davis, The Melody Man\\" and operating Triangle Music Publishing Co., which was founded in 1919 with the help of George F. Briegel (1890‚Äì1968).Triangle Co. Progressing, The Music Trades, pg. 42, February 15, 1919 Fats Waller (1938) He has to be considered as an important influence for Fats Waller, having actually talked the shy, reluctant Waller into considering a performing career. Davis pushed Waller to compose seriously for the piano (as \\"African Ripples\\" 1931). Davis' name was found as 'songwriter' of Waller songs such as \\"Alligator Crawl\\" (1927) and \\"Our Love Was Meant To Be\\", also the Andy Razaf titles \\"Alexander's Back in Town\\" and \\"After I've Spent My Best Years on You\\". Davis managed to cheat Razaf out of royalties to \\"S'posin'\\", which was written to Paul Denniker's music. As a publisher Davis worked with Porter Grainger (\\"Wylie Avenue Blues\\", 1927), Howard Johnson (\\"Florida Flo\\"), Chris Smith, Alex Hill, Spencer Williams, Carson Robison, Tom Delaney, J. C. Johnson, and Claude Hopkins.David A. Jason, Tin Pan Alley: An Encyclopedia of the Golden Age of American Song, pg. 374, Taylor & Francis (2003) () () () Davis dropped the Triangle imprint in the 1930s and replaced it with Joe Davis, Inc. He sold the firm in 1939 and went into the record manufacturing business. Billy Murray (1919) In May 1942, Davis founded his first record label, Beacon Records. On Beacon, Davis published in 1943 and 1944 the music of Billy Murray/Monroe Silver (Casey and Cohen in the Army, 1943), Irving Kaufman with the Buddy Clark Orchestra, and local vocal ensembles as The Red Caps. In 1944 Davis purchased most of the short-lived Varsity label's hundreds of master records when they went bankrupt in the early 1940s, but had with Varsity a tiny shellac ration from which to press the records. Joe Davis then pressed token quantities of records by the State Street Ramblers (Jimmy Blythe), Thomas A. Dorsey (as Georgia Tom), and Bradley Kincaid, using Gennett and Champion masters, also reissues from the 1939-Varsity label by Harry James, Frank Trumbauer, Vincent Lopez, Sammy Kaye, or The Three Suns;. but had a tiny shellac ration from which to press the records. In 1945 he founded the Joe Davis Record Company with the sub labels Beacon, Celebrity and (Joe) Davis Records. The Company was placed in 331 West 49th Street, with subsidiary in Richmond, Virginia. Davis edited pop music, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel and Latin music, by artists such as Coleman Hawkins (\\"On the Bean\\" 1945), the vocal ensemble Five Red Caps (\\"Just for You\\") and singer Una Mae Carlisle (\\"I'm a Good, Good Woman\\" 1945). Joe Davis was making use of her talents as a prolific songwriter and surrounding her once again with musicians including Ray Nance, Budd Johnson and Shadow Wilson (\\"Tain't Yours\\"). Gabriel Brown (1935) Davis edited an album by Otis Blackwell and a compilation with the title World Famous Rhythm and Blues Groups. also in the 1950s on Davis Records swing and jazz recordings by Frank Signorelli, Erskine Butterfield, Lee Castle and Eddie Miller, under Joe Davis Records blues recordings by Walter Thomas, Champion Jack Dupree and Gabriel Brown. Davis worked in the early 1950s for MGM Records and founded the label Jay-Dee in spring 1953; he edited re-issues from The Crickets with the lead singer (Grover) Dean Barlowe, recordings by doo-wop ensembles as The Mellows, with the lead singer Lillian Leach and The Blenders (\\"Don't Play Around With Love\\", 1953), the latter song being also recorded with the 'blue' alternate take (\\"Don't Fuck Around With Love\\" #780-45 (1953) reissued 1973). The Mellows recorded several songs for Jay-Dee, including \\"How Sentimental Can I Be\\" in August 1954, \\"Smoke From Your Cigarette\\" in January 1955, and \\"I Still Care,\\" issued in April 1955 and probably the high point of their career. In 1956 Davis also recorded The Chestnuts (\\"Love Is True\\"). In 1954 Davis reactivated his Beacon label for re-issues of R&B-recordings.; He edited recordings of Dean Barlow & The Crickets and The Deep River Boys. In 1961 Davis also recorded on his Beacon label a session of jazz pianist Elmo Hope, but at this time mostly party music. In the 1960s he led Beacon and Celebrity as his two publishing companies. Davis died on 3 September 1978 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Early life Born in Olympia, Washington, Gundersen is the oldest of five biological and three adopted siblings, in a family that moved to Centralia, Washington to homestead when he was five. Gundersen was home schooled in a conservative Christian household. He took piano lessons at age 13 and later learned to play the guitar. At the age of 18, Gundersen left home to pursue a career in music and began to play at venues around Seattle. As a teenager, Gundersen formed his first band, Beneath Oceans, with a few friends from his high school. The band included Gundersen, Michael Porter on lead guitar, and Keelan O‚ÄôHara on drums. Career In 2008 Gundersen produced his first EP, Brand New World. Early in his career, he began to perform in Seattle. Among others, Gundersen is said to be influenced by Ryan Adams, Dashboard Confessional, and Neil Young. In 2008, Gundersen collaborated with friends and his then-16-year-old sister to form the band The Courage. The group served as his backing band as he performed songs from Brand New World at clubs and cafes around Washington state. The group later recorded a live album, Live at the Triple Door, under the name Noah Gundersen & The Courage in 2008. The band performed at the Sisters Folk Festival in both 2008 and 2010 and evolved further, recording their debut album, Fearful Bones, under the name The Courage in 2010. While also performing and recording with The Courage, Gundersen remained focused on his solo career. His second EP, Saints & Liars, was released in 2009. A rough recording of the EP originally circulated, landing on the desk of producer Daniel Mendez, who mixed the EP for a full release. Mendez then worked with Gundersen to release a follow-up EP, Family in 2011. Launching his career further into the mainstream, Gundersen's title song \\"Family\\" was hand-selected by producer Kurt Sutter for the hit FX TV show, Sons of Anarchy. Sutter again looked to Gundersen and The Forest Rangers to create an original song for the show in 2014, and the song \\"Day Is Gone\\" was later nominated for an Emmy Award for Original Music and Lyrics. The song \\"Family\\" also appeared on The Vampire Diaries on the CW. The track \\"David\\" was also later used in a 2015 episode of the Fox TV series The Following. In 2014, Gundersen self-produced his debut album, Ledges, at Seattle‚Äôs Studio Litho, owned by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. The album addressed themes like faith, death, and past relationships. The debut album propelled Gundersen's career further into indie folk stardom, with his song \\"Poor Man's Son\\" - which was originally recorded for the Live at the Triple Door album with The Courage - receiving a feature on The Originals. While touring his debut album, Gundersen also exclusively sold a five-song EP titled \\"Twenty-Something\\" to concertgoers. Tracks from the EP were later available online through the deluxe edition release of Ledges. Following up his breakthrough album Ledges, Gundersen returned to the studio to record his second LP, Carry the Ghost, which was released in 2015. The album deals with the challenges of success, failed relationships, religion, and sexuality. Gundersen has said he took inspiration from Neil Young's album Tonight's the Night. Later in 2015, Gundersen helped to produce the David Ramirez album Fables, which released on August 28. Returning to his hometown during a lull in his tour schedule, Gundersen reunited with friends from his high school band, Beneath Oceans. Originally reuniting as a joke, the group began to play old songs from their early days. Gundersen said of the reunion, \\"we reconnected to see if the old songs were still any good. They weren‚Äôt, so we started writing new ones.‚Äù On December 1, 2015 the group released their first album, an eponymous EP titled Young in the City. The release was then followed up with live performances in the Seattle area and a second EP titled II on October 7, 2016. In July 2017, Gundersen announced the completion of a new solo LP, White Noise, which was released on September 22, 2017. It was a departure from the style of his previous albums, with a much heavier, more rock-inspired sound. On June 21, 2019, Gundersen announced the forthcoming release of another solo LP, Lover, which was released on August 23, 2019. On the same day, he released a single from the album titled \\"Robin Williams\\".

Goodman wrote Viola \\"had a nasty temper, but [predecessor chairman Lou] Guttman says he didn‚Äôt lose control of his emotions easily\\" and that \\"beneath the spit and polish he was still a tough guy from Brooklyn.\\" In the book, Lou Guttman, the previous chairman at the New York Mercantile Exchange, said Viola \\"exuded leadership. His personality was amazing. He drew people in. He was a phenomenal speaker. Even if he didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about, he sounded like he knew what he was saying. He was an astute businessman and an extreme opportunist.\\" As of October 2020, Viola had a net worth of $2.5 billion, ranking him No. 339 on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America.  Nomination for Secretary of the Army  On December 19, 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Viola for the position of Secretary of the Army. The choice was reported to be concerning to the nominated Secretary of Defense General James Mattis, who was reportedly not informed of the choice prior to the announcement, a position he would directly oversee, and was concerned about potential trading practices which were not yet fully investigated. Viola withdrew himself from consideration for the position on February 3, 2017, citing his inability to comply with Pentagon regulations regarding personal businesses. Military Times reported that Viola had been searching for ways to divest from his business ventures, including transferring ownership of the Florida Panthers to his family members and transferring responsibility for operations to Vice Chairman Douglas Cifu. Philanthropy After the 9/11 attacks, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, and was the principal funder at its creation. Viola founded a technology company, Rowan Technology Solutions, to support cadet education in the areas of military history, military science, and leadership. Viola has endowed the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair in Catholic Theology at Fordham University. Personal life Viola and his wife Teresa have three adult sons, and live in New York City.

Economy and services The area is rich with fish and sharks, and Lonely Planet describes the Maskelynes as 'just gorgeous' and recommends them for snorkelling and diving opportunities - though warning of strong currents between the islands.

Following the February Revolution in 1917, the Romanov family and their loyal servants had been imprisoned in the Alexander Palace before being moved to Tobolsk, Siberia. They were next moved to a house in Yekaterinburg, near the Ural Mountains. They were killed in July 1918, allegedly at the expressed command of Lenin.Pringle, p. 261. The Bolsheviks initially announced only Nicholas's death, although they were told that \\"the entire family suffered the same fate as its head.\\"Wendy Slater, p. 153. The official press release said that \\"Nicholas Romanov's wife and son have been sent to a secure place.\\" For over eight years,Massie, p. 16. the Soviet leadership maintained a systematic web of disinformation as to the fate of the family,Rappaport, p. 218. from claiming in September 1919 that they were murdered by left-wing revolutionaries to denying outright in April 1922 that they were dead. The Soviets finally acknowledged the murders in 1926, following the publication in France of a 1919 investigation by a White √©migr√©, but said that the bodies were destroyed and that Lenin's Cabinet was not responsible.Massie, p. 19. The Soviet cover-up of the murders fuelled rumours of survivors. Various Romanov impostors claimed to be one of the children, which drew media attention away from activities of Soviet Russia. From 1938, Joseph Stalin suppressed any discussion regarding the fate of the family.Rappaport, p. 219. The burial site was discovered in 1979 by Alexander Avdonin, an amateur sleuth. The Soviet Union did not acknowledge the existence of these remains publicly until 1989, during the glasnost period.Rappaport, p. 220. The identity of the remains was later confirmed by forensic and DNA analysis and investigation, with the assistance of British experts. In 1998, 80 years after the executions, the remains of the Romanov family were reinterred in a state funeral in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. The funeral was not attended by key members of the Russian Orthodox Church, who disputed the authenticity of the remains. In 2007, a second, smaller grave, containing the remains of two Romanov children missing from the larger grave, a boy and a girl, was discovered by amateur archaeologists. However, their remains are kept in a state repository pending further DNA tests. The remains of Alexei and a sister have been confirmed by DNA analysis, but the government was allowing the Church to hold Alexei's remains for additional testing. In 2008, after considerable and protracted legal wrangling, the Russian Prosecutor General's office rehabilitated the Romanov family as \\"victims of political repressions\\".Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. 381. A criminal case was opened by the post-Soviet government in 1993, but nobody was prosecuted on the basis that the perpetrators were dead. Some historians attribute the execution order to the government in Moscow, specifically Sverdlov and Lenin, who wanted to prevent the rescue of the Imperial Family by the approaching Czechoslovak Legion during the ongoing Russian Civil War.Robert Gellately. Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe Knopf, 2007 p. 65. This is supported by a passage in Leon Trotsky's diary.King, G. (1999). The Last Empress, Replica Books, p. 358. . An investigation led by Vladimir Solovyov concluded in 2011 that, despite the opening of state archives in the post-Soviet years, no written document has been found that indicates that either Lenin or Sverdlov instigated the orders; however, they did endorse the executions after they occurred. Other sources argue that Lenin and the central Soviet government had wanted to conduct a trial of the Romanovs, with Trotsky serving as prosecutor, but that the local Ural Soviet, under pressure from Left S-Rs and anarchists, undertook the executions on their own initiative due to the approach of the Czechoslovaks. Lenin had close control over the Romanovs, although he ensured his name was not associated with their fate in any official documents.Rappaport, p. 142. In 1998 President Boris Yeltsin described the killings of the royal family as one of the most shameful chapters in Russian history. Background left On 22 March 1917, Nicholas, deposed as a monarch and addressed by the sentries as \\"Nicholas Romanov\\", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo. He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government, and the family was surrounded by guards and confined to their quarters.Tames, p. 56. In August 1917, Alexander Kerensky's provisional government, after a failed attempt to send the Romanovs to Britain, which was ruled by Nicholas and Alexandra's mutual first cousin, King George V, evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk, Siberia, allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. There they lived in the former governor's mansion in considerable comfort. After the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter. Talk in the government of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. Nicholas was forbidden to wear epaulettes, and the sentries scrawled lewd drawings on the fence to offend his daughters. On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldiers' rations. Their 10 servants were dismissed, and they had to give up butter and coffee.Tames, p. 62. As the Bolsheviks gathered strength, the government in April moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria to Yekaterinburg under the direction of Vasily Yakovlev. Alexei, who had severe haemophilia, was too ill to accompany his parents and remained with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia, not leaving Tobolsk until May 1918. The family was imprisoned with a few remaining retainers in Yekaterinburg's Ipatiev House, which was designated The House of Special Purpose (). Anastasia Hendrikova working on a kitchen garden at Alexander Palace in May 1917. The family was allowed no such indulgences at the Ipatiev House.Rappaport, p. 22. The House of Special Purpose The imperial family was kept in strict isolation at the Ipatiev House.Rappaport, p. 20. They were strictly forbidden to speak any language other than Russian.Rappaport, p. 23. They were not permitted access to their luggage, which was stored in an outhouse in the interior courtyard. Their Brownie cameras and photographic equipment were confiscated. The servants were ordered to address the Romanovs only by their names and patronymics.Rappaport, p. 102. The family was subjected to regular searches of their belongings, confiscation of their money for \\"safekeeping by the Ural Regional Soviet's treasurer\\",Rappaport, p. 31. and attempts to remove Alexandra's and her daughters' gold bracelets from their wrists.Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. 372. The house was surrounded by a 4 metre (14 ft) high, double palisade that obscured the view of the streets from the house.Massie, p. 283. The initial fence enclosed the garden along Voznesensky Lane. On 5 June a second palisade was erected, higher and longer than the first, which completely enclosed the property.King, G., and Wilson, P., (year) p. 127. The second palisade was constructed after it was learned that passersby could see Nicholas's legs when he used the double swing in the garden.Rappaport, p. 27. Ipatiev House, with the palisade erected just before Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria arrived on 30 April 1918. On the top left of the house is a attic left belfry aimed at the tsar and tsaritsa's bedroom on the southeastern corner of the house.John Browne, Hidden Account of the Romanovs, p. 471.left The windows in all the family's rooms were sealed shut and covered with newspapers (later painted with whitewash on 15 May).Massie, p. 278. The family's only source of ventilation was a fortochka in the grand duchesses' bedroom, but peeking out of it was strictly forbidden; in May a sentry fired a shot at Anastasia when she looked out.Rappaport, p. 16. After Romanov made repeated requests, one of the two windows in the tsar and tsarina's corner bedroom was unsealed on 23 June 1918.Massie, p. 289. The guards were ordered to increase their surveillance accordingly, and the prisoners were warned not to look out the window or attempt to signal anyone outside, on pain of being shot.Rappaport, p. 17. From this window, they could see only the spire of the Voznesensky Cathedral located across the road from the house. An iron grille was installed on 11 July, after Alexandra had ignored repeated warnings from the commandant, Yakov Yurovsky, not to stand too close to the open window.Rappaport, pp. 118‚Äì119. The guard commandant and his senior aides had complete access at any time to all rooms occupied by the family.Rappaport, pp. 17‚Äì18. The prisoners were required to ring a bell each time they wished to leave their rooms to use the bathroom and lavatory on the landing.Rappaport, p. 29. Strict rationing of the water supply was enforced on the prisoners after the guards complained that it regularly ran out.Rappaport, p. 21. Recreation was allowed only twice daily in the garden, for half an hour morning and afternoon. The prisoners were ordered not to engage in conversation with any of the guards.Rappaport, p. 25. Rations were mostly tea and black bread for breakfast, and cutlets or soup with meat for lunch; the prisoners were informed that \\"they were no longer permitted to live like tsars\\".Rappaport, p. 24. In mid-June, nuns from the Novo-Tikhvinsky Monastery also brought the family food on a daily basis, most of which the captors took when it arrived. The family was not allowed visitors or to receive and send letters. Princess Helen of Serbia visited the house in June but was refused entry at gunpoint by the guards,Rappaport, p. 34. while Dr Vladimir Derevenko's regular visits to treat Alexei were curtailed when Yurovsky became commandant. No excursions to Divine Liturgy at the nearby church were permitted. In early June, the family no longer received their daily newspapers. The Romanov entourage. From left to right: Catherine Schneider, Ilya Tatishchev, Pierre Gilliard, Anastasia Hendrikova and Vasily Dolgorukov. They voluntarily accompanied the Romanov family into imprisonment but were forcibly separated by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg. All except Gilliard were later murdered by the Bolsheviks.Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. 377. To maintain a sense of normality, the Bolsheviks lied to the Romanovs on 13 July 1918 that two of their loyal servants, Klementy Nagorny (Alexei's sailor nanny)Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. xv. and Ivan Sednev (OTMA's footman; Leonid Sednev's uncle),Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. xiv. \\"had been sent out of this government\\" (i.e. out of the jurisdiction of Yekaterinburg and Perm province). In fact, both men were already dead: after the Bolsheviks had removed them from the Ipatiev House in May, they had been shot by the Cheka with a group of other hostages on 6 July, in reprisal for the death of , a local Bolshevik killed by the Whites.Rappaport, p. 157. On 14 July, a priest and deacon conducted a liturgy for the Romanovs.Rappaport, p. 159. The following morning, four housemaids were hired to wash the floors of the Popov House and Ipatiev House; they were the last civilians to see the family alive. On both occasions, they were under strict instructions not to engage in conversation with the family.Rappaport, p. 160. Yurovsky always kept watch during the liturgy and while the housemaids were cleaning the bedrooms with the family.Rappaport, p. 171. The 16 men of the internal guard slept in the basement, hallway, and commandant's office during shifts. The external guard, led by Pavel Medvedev, numbered 56 and took over the Popov House opposite. The guards were allowed to bring in women for sex and drinking sessions in the Popov House and basement rooms of the Ipatiev House. There were four machine gun emplacements: one in the bell tower of the Voznesensky Cathedral aimed toward the house; a second in the basement window of the Ipatiev House facing the street; a third monitored the balcony overlooking the garden at the back of the house; and a fourth in the attic overlooking the intersection, directly above the tsar and tsarina's bedroom. Ten guard posts were located in and around the Ipatiev House, and the exterior was patrolled twice hourly day and night. In early May, the guards moved the piano from the dining room, where the prisoners could play it, to the commandant's office next to the Romanovs' bedrooms. The guards would play the piano, while singing Russian revolutionary songs and drinking and smoking. They also listened to the Romanovs' records on the confiscated phonograph. The lavatory on the landing was also used by the guards, who scribbled political slogans and crude graffiti on the walls. The number of Ipatiev House guards totaled 300 at the time the imperial family was killed.Rappaport, p. 97. When Yurovsky replaced Aleksandr Avdeev on 4 July,Rappaport, p. 140. he moved the old internal guard members to the Popov House. The senior aides were retained but were designated to guard the hallway area and no longer had access to the Romanovs' rooms; only Yurovsky's men had it. The local Cheka chose replacements from the volunteer battalions of the Verkh-Isetsk factory at Yurovsky's request. He wanted dedicated Bolsheviks who could be relied on to do whatever was asked of them. They were hired on the understanding that they would be prepared, if necessary, to kill the tsar, about which they were sworn to secrecy. Nothing at that stage was said about killing the family or servants. To prevent a repetition of the fraternization that had occurred under Avdeev, Yurovsky chose mainly foreigners. Nicholas noted in his diary on 8 July that \\"new Latvians are standing guard\\", describing them as Letts ‚Äì a term commonly used in Russia to classify someone as of European, non-Russian origin. The leader of the new guards was Adolf Lepa, a Lithuanian.Rappaport, pp. 86‚Äì87. In mid- July 1918, forces of the Czechoslovak Legion were closing on Yekaterinburg, to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway, of which they had control. According to historian David Bullock, the Bolsheviks, falsely believing that the Czechoslovaks were on a mission to rescue the family, panicked and executed their wards. The Legions arrived less than a week later and on 25 July captured the city.Bullock, David (2012) The Czech Legion 1914‚Äì20, Osprey Publishing During the imperial family's imprisonment in late June, Pyotr Voykov and Alexander Beloborodov, president of the Ural Regional Soviet,Rappaport, p. 130. directed the smuggling of letters written in French to the Ipatiev House. These claimed to be by a monarchist officer seeking to rescue the family, but were composed at the behest of the Cheka.Rappaport, p. 125. These fabricated letters, along with the Romanov responses to them (written on either blank spaces or the envelopes),Slater, p. 53. provided the Central Executive Committee (CEC) in Moscow with further justification to 'liquidate' the imperial family.Rappaport, p. 120. Yurovsky later observed that, by responding to the faked letters, Nicholas \\"had fallen into a hasty plan by us to trap him\\". On 13 July, across the road from the Ipatiev House, a demonstration of Red Army soldiers, Socialist Revolutionaries, and anarchists was staged on Voznesensky Square, demanding the dismissal of the Yekaterinburg Soviet and the transfer of control of the city to them. This rebellion was violently suppressed by a detachment of Red Guards led by Peter Ermakov, which opened fire on the protesters, all within earshot of the tsar and tsarina's bedroom window. The authorities exploited the incident as a monarchist-led rebellion that threatened the security of the captives at the Ipatiev House.Rappaport, p. 144. Planning for the execution The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on 29 June that the Romanov family should be executed. Filipp Goloshchyokin arrived in Moscow on 3 July with a message insisting on the Tsar's execution.Rappaport, p. 132. Only seven of the 23 members of the Central Executive Committee were in attendance, three of whom were Lenin, Sverdlov and Felix Dzerzhinsky. They agreed that the presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet should organize the practical details for the family's execution and decide the precise day on which it would take place when the military situation dictated it, contacting Moscow for final approval.Rappaport, p. 134. The killing of the Tsar's wife and children was also discussed, but it was kept a state secret to avoid any political repercussions; German ambassador Wilhelm von Mirbach made repeated enquiries to the Bolsheviks concerning the family's well-being.Rappaport, pp. 34‚Äì35. Another diplomat, British consul Thomas Preston, who lived near the Ipatiev House, was often pressured by Pierre Gilliard, Sydney Gibbes and Prince Vasily Dolgorukov to help the Romanovs; Dolgorukov smuggled notes from his prison cell before he was murdered by Grigory Nikulin, Yurovsky's assistant.Rappaport, p. 117. Preston's requests to be granted access to the family were consistently rejected.Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. 378. As Trotsky later said, \\"The Tsar's family was a victim of the principle that forms the very axis of monarchy: dynastic inheritance\\", for which their deaths were a necessity.Rappaport, p. 141. Goloshchyokin reported back to Yekaterinburg on 12 July with a summary of his discussion about the Romanovs with Moscow, along with instructions that nothing relating to their deaths should be directly communicated to Lenin.Rappaport, p. 201. On 14 July, Yurovsky was finalizing the disposal site and how to destroy as much evidence as possible at the same time.Rappaport, p. 167. He was frequently in consultation with Peter Ermakov, who was in charge of the disposal squad and claimed to know the outlying countryside.Rappaport, p. 168. Yurovsky wanted to gather the family and servants in a small, confined space from which they could not escape. The basement room chosen for this purpose had a barred window which was nailed shut to muffle the sound of shooting and in case of any screaming.Rappaport, p. 186. Shooting and stabbing them at night while they slept or killing them in the forest and then dumping them into the Iset pond with lumps of metal weighted to their bodies were ruled out.Rappaport, p. 176. Yurovsky's plan was to perform an efficient execution of all 11 prisoners simultaneously, though he also took into account that he would have to prevent those involved from raping the women or searching the bodies for jewels. Having previously seized some jewelry, he suspected more was hidden in their clothes; the bodies were stripped naked in order to obtain the rest (this, along with the mutilations were aimed at preventing investigators from identifying them). On 16 July, Yurovsky was informed by the Ural Soviets that Red Army contingents were retreating in all directions and the executions could not be delayed any longer. A coded telegram seeking final approval was sent by Goloshchyokin and Georgy Safarov at around 6 pm to Lenin in Moscow.Rappaport, p. 178. There is no documentary record of an answer from Moscow, although Yurovsky insisted that an order from the CEC to go ahead had been passed on to him by Goloshchyokin at around 7 pm.Rappaport, pp. 178‚Äì179. This claim was consistent with that of a former Kremlin guard, Aleksey Akimov, who in the late 1960s stated that Sverdlov instructed him to send a telegram confirming the CEC's approval of the 'trial' (code for execution) but required that both the written form and ticker tape be returned to him immediately after the message was sent. At 8 pm, Yurovsky sent his chauffeur to acquire a truck for transporting the bodies, along with rolls of canvas to wrap them in. The intention was to park it close to the basement entrance, with its engine running, to mask the noise of gunshots.Rappaport, p. 180. Yurovsky and Pavel Medvedev collected 14 handguns to use that night: two Browning pistols (one M1900 and one M1906), two Colt M1911 pistols, two Mauser C96s, one Smith & Wesson and seven Belgian-made Nagants. The Nagant operated on old black gunpowder which produced a good deal of smoke and fumes; smokeless powder was only just being phased in.Rappaport, p. 181. In the commandant's office, Yurovsky assigned victims to each killer before distributing the handguns. He took a Mauser and Colt while Ermakov armed himself with three Nagants, one Mauser and a bayonet; he was the only one assigned to kill two prisoners (Alexandra and Botkin). Yurovsky instructed his men to \\"shoot straight at the heart to avoid an excessive quantity of blood and get it over quickly.\\"Montefiore, p. 644. At least two of the Letts, an Austro-Hungarian prisoner of war named Andras Verhas and Adolf Lepa, himself in charge of the Lett contingent, refused to shoot the women. Yurovsky sent them to the Popov House for failing \\"at that important moment in their revolutionary duty\\".Rappaport, p. 182. Neither Yurovsky nor any of the killers went into the logistics of how to efficiently destroy eleven bodies. He was under pressure to ensure that no remains would later be found by monarchists who would exploit them to rally anti-communist support.Rappaport, pp. 175‚Äì176. Execution left While the Romanovs were having dinner on 16 July 1918, Yurovsky entered the sitting room and informed them that kitchen boy Leonid Sednev was leaving to meet his uncle, Ivan Sednev, who had returned to the city asking to see him; Ivan had already been shot by the Cheka.Rappaport, pp. 179‚Äì180. The family was very upset as Leonid was Alexei's only playmate and he was the fifth member of the imperial entourage to be taken from them, but they were assured by Yurovsky that he would be back soon. Alexandra did not trust Yurovsky, writing in her final diary entry just hours before her death, \\"whether it's true & we shall see the boy back again!\\" Leonid was kept in the Popov House that night. Yurovsky saw no reason to kill him and wanted him removed before the execution took place. Around midnight on 17 July, Yurovsky ordered the Romanovs' physician, Eugene Botkin, to awaken the sleeping family and ask them to put on their clothes, under the pretext that the family would be moved to a safe location due to impending chaos in Yekaterinburg. The Romanovs were then ordered into a semi-basement room. Nicholas asked if Yurovsky could bring two chairs, on which Tsarevich Alexei and Alexandra sat. Yurovsky's assistant Grigory Nikulin remarked to him that the \\"heir wanted to die in a chair.Slater, p. 5. Very well then, let him have one.\\" The prisoners were told to wait in the cellar room while the truck that would transport them was being brought to the House. A few minutes later, an execution squad of secret police was brought in and Yurovsky read aloud the order given to him by the Ural Executive Committee: Nicholas, facing his family, turned and said \\"What? What?\\"100 –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞–∑–Ω–µ–π, M., –í–µ—á–µ, 1999, p. 439 Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and the weapons were raised. The Empress and Grand Duchess Olga, according to a guard's reminiscence, had tried to bless themselves, but failed amid the shooting. Yurovsky reportedly raised his Colt gun at Nicholas's torso and fired; Nicholas fell dead, pierced with at least three bullets in his upper chest. The intoxicated Peter Ermakov, the military commissar for Verkh-Isetsk, shot and killed Alexandra with a bullet wound to the head. He then shot at Maria, who ran for the double doors, hitting her in the thigh.Montefiore, p. 645. The remaining executioners shot chaotically and over each other's shoulders until the room was so filled with smoke and dust that no one could see anything at all in the darkness nor hear any commands amid the noise. Alexey Kabanov, who ran onto the street to check the noise levels, heard dogs barking from the Romanovs' quarters and the sound of gunshots loud and clear despite the noise from the Fiat's engine. Kabanov then hurried downstairs and told the men to stop firing and kill the family and their dogs with their gun butts and bayonets.Rappaport, p. 193. Within minutes, Yurovsky was forced to stop the shooting because of the caustic smoke of burned gunpowder, dust from the plaster ceiling caused by the reverberation of bullets, and the deafening gunshots. When they stopped, the doors were then opened to scatter the smoke. While waiting for the smoke to abate, the killers could hear moans and whimpers inside the room.Rappaport, pp. 189‚Äì190. As it cleared, it became evident that although several of the family's retainers had been killed, all of the Imperial children were alive and only Maria was injured. The basement where the Romanov family was killed. The wall had been torn apart in search of bullets and other evidence by investigators in 1919. The double doors leading to a storeroom were locked during the execution. The noise of the guns had been heard by households all around, awakening many people. The executioners were ordered to use their bayonets, a technique which proved ineffective and meant that the children had to be dispatched by still more gunshots, this time aimed more precisely at their heads. The Tsarevich was the first of the children to be executed. Yurovsky watched in disbelief as Nikulin spent an entire magazine from his Browning gun on Alexei, who was still seated transfixed in his chair; he also had jewels sewn into his undergarment and forage cap.Rappaport, p. 191. Ermakov shot and stabbed him, and when that failed, Yurovsky shoved him aside and killed the boy with a gunshot to the head. The last to die were Tatiana, Anastasia, and Maria, who were carrying a few pounds (over 1.3 kilograms) of diamonds sewn into their clothing, which had given them a degree of protection from the firing.Massie, p. 8. However, they were speared with bayonets as well. Olga sustained a gunshot wound to the head. Maria and Anastasia were said to have crouched up against a wall covering their heads in terror until they were shot. Yurovsky killed Tatiana and Alexei. Tatiana died from a single shot to the back of her head.King, G., and Wilson, P., The Fate of the Romonovs, p. 303. Alexei received two bullets to the head, right behind the ear.Massie, p. 6. Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid, survived the initial onslaught but was quickly stabbed to death against the back wall while trying to defend herself with a small pillow which she had carried that was filled with precious gems and jewels.Radzinsky (1992), pp. 380‚Äì393. While the bodies were being placed on stretchers, one of the girls cried out and covered her face with her arm.Rappaport, p. 194. Ermakov grabbed Alexander Strekotin's rifle and bayoneted her in the chest, but when it failed to penetrate he pulled out his revolver and shot her in the head.Slater, p. 8. While Yurovsky was checking the victims for pulses, Ermakov walked through the room, flailing the bodies with his bayonet. The execution lasted about 20 minutes, Yurovsky later admitting to Nikulin's \\"poor mastery of his weapon and inevitable nerves\\".Rappaport, p. 192. Future investigations calculated that a possible 70 bullets were fired, roughly seven bullets per shooter, of which 57 were found in the basement and at all three subsequent gravesites. Some of Pavel Medvedev's stretcher bearers began frisking the bodies for valuables. Yurovsky saw this and demanded that they surrender any looted items or be shot. The attempted looting, coupled with Ermakov's incompetence and drunken state, convinced Yurovsky to oversee the disposal of the bodies himself. Only Alexei's spaniel, Joy, survived to be rescued by a British officer of the Allied Intervention Force,Rappaport, p. 214. living out his final days in Windsor, Berkshire. Alexandre Beloborodov sent a coded telegram to Lenin's secretary, Nikolai Gorbunov. It was found by White investigator Nikolai Sokolov and reads: Aleksandr Lisitsyn of the Cheka, an essential witness on behalf of Moscow, was designated to promptly dispatch to Sverdlov soon after the executions of Nicholas and Alexandra's politically valuable diaries and letters, which would be published in Russia as soon as possible.Rappaport, p. 195. Beloborodov and Nikulin oversaw the ransacking of the Romanov quarters, seizing all the family's personal items, the most valuable piled up in Yurovsky's office whilst things considered inconsequential and of no value were stuffed into the stoves and burned. Everything was packed into the Romanovs' own trunks for dispatch to Moscow under escort by commissars.Rappaport, p. 200. On 19 July, the Bolsheviks nationalized all confiscated Romanov properties, the same day Sverdlov announced the tsar's execution to the Council of People's Commissars.Rappaport, p. 208. Disposal The bodies of the Romanovs and their servants were loaded onto a Fiat truck equipped with a 60-hp engine, with a cargo area 6 √ó 10 feet in size. Heavily laden, the vehicle struggled for nine miles on boggy road to reach the Koptyaki forest. Yurovsky was furious when he discovered that the drunken Ermakov had brought only one shovel for the burial.Rappaport, p. 196. About half a mile further on, near crossing no. 185 on the line serving the Verkh-Isetsk works, 25 men working for Ermakov were waiting with horses and light carts. These men were all intoxicated and they were outraged that the prisoners were not brought to them alive. They expected to be part of the lynch mob.Rappaport, p. 197. Yurovsky maintained control of the situation with great difficulty, eventually getting Ermakov's men to shift some of the bodies from the truck onto the carts. A few of Ermakov's men pawed the female bodies for diamonds hidden in their undergarments, two of whom lifted up Alexandra's skirt and fingered her genitals.Slater, p. 9. Yurovsky ordered them at gunpoint to back off, dismissing the two who had groped the tsarina's corpse and any others he had caught looting. One of the men said that he could \\"die in peace\\", having touched the \\"royal cunt\\". In the hasty disposal of the bodies, several belongings like these left The truck was bogged down in an area of marshy ground near the Gorno-Uralsk railway line, during which all the bodies were unloaded onto carts and taken to the disposal site. The sun was up by the time the carts came within sight of the disused mine, which was a large clearing at a place called the 'Four Brothers'.Slater, p. 10. Yurovsky's men ate hardboiled eggs supplied by the local nuns (food that was meant for the imperial family), while the remainder of Ermakov's men were ordered back to the city as Yurovsky did not trust them and was displeased with their drunkenness. Yurovsky and five other men laid out the bodies on the grass and undressed them, the clothes piled up and burned while Yurovsky took inventory of their jewellery. Only Maria's undergarments contained no jewels, which to Yurovsky was proof that the family had ceased to trust her ever since she became too friendly with one of the guards back in May.Montefiore, p. 639. Once the bodies were \\"completely naked\\" they were dumped into a mineshaft and doused with sulphuric acid to disfigure them beyond recognition. Only then did Yurovsky discover that the pit was less than 3 metres (9 feet) deep and the muddy water below did not fully submerge the corpses as he had expected. He unsuccessfully tried to collapse the mine with hand grenades, after which his men covered it with loose earth and branches.Rappaport, p. 199. Yurovsky left three men to guard the site while he returned to Yekaterinburg with a bag filled with 18 lb of looted diamonds, to report back to Beloborodov and Goloshchyokin. It was decided that the pit was too shallow.Rappaport, p. 203. Sergey Chutskaev of the local Soviet told Yurovsky of some deeper copper mines west of Yekaterinburg, the area remote and swampy and a grave there less likely to be discovered. He inspected the site on the evening of 17 July and reported back to the Cheka at the Amerikanskaya Hotel. He ordered additional trucks to be sent out to Koptyaki whilst assigning Pyotr Voykov to obtain barrels of petrol, kerosene and sulphuric acid, and plenty of dry firewood. Yurovsky also seized several horse-drawn carts to be used in the removal of the bodies to the new site.Rappaport, p. 202. Yurovsky and Goloshchyokin, along with several Cheka agents, returned to the mineshaft at about 4 am on the morning of 18 July. The sodden corpses were hauled out one by one using ropes tied to their mangled limbs and laid under a tarpaulin. Yurovsky, worried that he might not have enough time to take the bodies to the deeper mine, ordered his men to dig another burial pit then and there, but the ground was too hard. He returned to the Amerikanskaya Hotel to confer with the Cheka. He seized a truck which he had loaded with blocks of concrete for attaching to the bodies before submerging them in the new mineshaft. A second truck carried a detachment of Cheka agents to help move the bodies. Yurovsky returned to the forest at 10 pm on 18 July. The bodies were again loaded onto the Fiat truck, which by then had been extricated from the mud.Rappaport, p. 204. Railroad ties on the Koptyaki Road in 1919. Investigator Nikolai Sokolov took this photograph as evidence of where the Fiat truck had got stuck at 4:30am on 19 July, unaware that it was in fact the second burial site.Massie, p. 26. During transportation to the deeper copper mines on the early morning of 19 July, the Fiat truck carrying the bodies got stuck again in mud near Porosenkov Log (\\"Piglet's Ravine\\"). With the men exhausted, most refusing to obey orders and dawn approaching, Yurovsky decided to bury them under the road where the truck had stalled.Slater, pp. 13‚Äì14. They dug a grave that was 6 √ó 8 ft in size and barely 60 centimetres (2 ft) deep.Rappaport, p. 205. Alexei Trupp's body was tossed in first, followed by the Tsar's and then the rest. Sulphuric acid was again used to dissolve the bodies, their faces smashed with rifle butts and covered with quicklime. Railroad ties were placed over the grave to disguise it, with the Fiat truck being driven back and forth over the ties to press them into the earth. The burial was completed at 6 am on 19 July. Yurovsky separated the Tsarevich Alexei and one of his sisters to be buried about 15 metres (50 ft) away, in an attempt to confuse anyone who might discover the mass grave with only nine bodies. Since the female body was badly disfigured, Yurovsky mistook her for Anna Demidova; in his report he wrote that he had actually wanted to destroy Alexandra's corpse.Massie, p. 27. Alexei and his sister were burned in a bonfire and their remaining charred bones were thoroughly smashed with spades and tossed into a smaller pit. 44 partial bone fragments from both corpses were found in August 2007. Sokolov's investigation After Yekaterinburg fell to the anti-communist White Army on 25 July, Admiral Alexander Kolchak established the Sokolov Commission to investigate the murders at the end of that month. Nikolai Sokolov, a legal investigator for the Omsk Regional Court, was appointed to undertake this. He interviewed several members of the Romanov entourage in February 1919, notably Pierre Gilliard, Alexandra Tegleva and Sydney Gibbes.Rappaport, Four Sisters (2014), p. 379. left The remains of the dog \\"Jimmy\\" found by Sokolov Sokolov discovered a large number of the Romanovs' belongings and valuables that were overlooked by Yurovsky and his men in and around the mineshaft where the bodies were initially disposed. Among them were burned bone fragments, congealed fat,Massie, p. 124. Dr Botkin's upper dentures and glasses, corset stays, insignias and belt buckles, shoes, keys, pearls and diamonds, a few spent bullets, and part of a severed female finger. The corpse of Anastasia's King Charles Spaniel, Jimmy, was also found in the pit.Massie, p. 10. The pit revealed no traces of clothing, which was consistent with Yurovsky's account that all the victims' clothes were burned.Massie, p. 39. Sokolov ultimately failed to find the concealed burial site on the Koptyaki Road; he photographed the spot as evidence of where the Fiat truck had become stuck on the morning of 19 July. The impending return of Bolshevik forces in July 1919 forced him to evacuate, and he brought the box containing the relics he recovered.Massie, p. 123. Sokolov accumulated eight volumes of photographic and eyewitness accounts.Rappaport, p. 212. He died in France in 1924 of a heart attack before he could complete his investigation. The box is stored in the Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Job in Uccle, Brussels.Remnick, Reporting: Writings from the New Yorker, p. 222. Holy Trinity Seminary in Jordanville, New York. On the right is a blouse that belonged to one of the grand duchesses. His preliminary report was published in a book that same year in French and then Russian. It was published in English in 1925. Until 1989, it was the only accepted historical account of the murders. He wrongly concluded that the prisoners died instantly from the shooting, with the exception of Alexei and Anastasia, who were shot and bayoneted to death, and that the bodies were destroyed in a massive bonfire.Slater, p. 45. Publication and worldwide acceptance of the investigation prompted the Soviets to issue a government- approved textbook in 1926 that largely plagiarized Sokolov's work, admitting that the empress and her children had been murdered with the Tsar. The Soviet government continued to attempt to control accounts of the murders. In 1938, during a period of purges, Joseph Stalin issued a clampdown on all discussion of the Romanov murders. Sokolov's report was also banned. Leonid Brezhnev's Politburo deemed the Ipatiev House of lacking \\"sufficient historical significance\\" and it was demolished in September 1977 by KGB chairman Yuri Andropov, less than a year before the sixtieth anniversary of the murders. Yeltsin wrote in his memoirs that \\"sooner or later we will be ashamed of this piece of barbarism\\". The destruction of the house did not stop pilgrims or monarchists from visiting the site. Local amateur sleuth Alexander Avdonin and filmmaker Geli Ryabov located the shallow grave on 30‚Äì31 May 1979 after years of covert investigation and a study of the primary evidence. Three skulls were removed from the grave, but after failing to find any scientist and laboratory to help examine them, and worried about the consequences of finding the grave, Avdonin and Ryabov reburied them in the summer of 1980.Massie, p. 30. The presidency of Mikhail Gorbachev brought with it the era of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (reform), which prompted Ryabov to reveal the Romanovs' gravesite to The Moscow News on 10 April 1989, much to Avdonin's dismay.Massie, p. 31. The remains were disinterred in 1991 by Soviet officials in a hasty 'official exhumation' that wrecked the site, destroying precious evidence. Since there were no clothes on the bodies and the damage inflicted was extensive, controversy persisted as to whether the skeletal remains identified and interred in St. Petersburg as Anastasia's were really hers or in fact Maria's. On 29 July 2007, another amateur group of local enthusiasts found the small pit containing the remains of Alexei and his sister, located in two small bonfire sites not far from the main grave on the Koptyaki Road. Although criminal investigators and geneticists identified them as Alexei and Maria, they remain stored in the state archives pending a decision from the church, which demanded a more \\"thorough and detailed\\" examination. Executioners Peter Ermakov survived the civil war unscathed; however, unlike the other killers, he received no awards or advancements, for which he grew bitter. For the rest of his life,Radzinsky, p. 397. he fought relentlessly for primacy by inflating his role in the murders as well as the revolution.Rappaport, p. 215. Local Communist Party members annually pay tribute to his gravestone on the anniversary of the murders, though on a few occasions it was also vandalized. Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, Grigory P. Nikulin, Mikhail A. Medvedev (Kuprin), Peter Ermakov, Stepan Vaganov, Alexey G. Kabanov (former soldier in the tsar's Life Guards and Chekist assigned to the attic machine gun), Pavel Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. Filipp Goloshchyokin, a close associate of Yakov Sverdlov, being a military commissar of the Uralispolkom in Yekaterinburg, however did not actually participate, and two or three guards refused to take part.Plotnikov, Ivan (2003). –û –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–µ —É–±–∏–π—Ü —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–µ–º—å–∏ –∏ –µ–µ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ª, No. 9 Pyotr Voykov was given the specific task of arranging for the disposal of their remains, obtaining 570 litres (150 gal) of gasoline and 180 kilograms (400 lbs) of sulphuric acid, the latter from the Yekaterinburg pharmacy. He was a witness but later claimed to have taken part in the murders, looting belongings from a dead grand duchess. After the killings, he was to declare that \\"The world will never know what we did with them.\\" Voykov served as Soviet ambassador to Poland in 1924, where he was assassinated by a Russian monarchist in July 1927. The men who were directly complicit in the murder of the imperial family largely survived in the immediate months after the murders. Stepan Vaganov, Ermakov's close associate,Rappaport, p. 127. was attacked and killed by peasants in late 1918 for his participation in local acts of brutal repression by the Cheka. Pavel Medvedev, head of the Ipatiev House guard and one of the key figures in the murders, was captured by the White Army in Perm in February 1919. During his interrogation he denied taking part in the murders, and died in prison of typhus. Alexandre Beloborodov and his deputy, Boris Didkovsky, were both killed in 1938 during the Great Purge. Filipp Goloshchyokin was shot in October 1941 in an NKVD prison and consigned to an unmarked grave. Three days after the murders, Yurovsky personally reported to Lenin on the events of that night and was rewarded with an appointment to the Moscow City Cheka. He held a succession of key economic and party posts, dying in the Kremlin Hospital in 1938 aged 60. Prior to his death, he donated the guns he used in the murders to the Museum of the Revolution in Moscow, and left behind three valuable, though contradictory, accounts of the event. A British officer who met Yurovsky in 1920 alleged that he was remorseful over his role in the execution of the Romanovs.Yakov Yurovsky, a biographical sketch adapted from However, in a final letter that was written to his children shortly before his death in 1938, he only reminisced about his revolutionary career and how \\"the storm of October\\" had \\"turned its brightest side\\" towards him, making him \\"the happiest of mortals\\";Rappaport, p. 216. there was no expression of regret or remorse over the murders. Yurovsky and his assistant, Nikulin, who died in 1964, are buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.Radzinsky, p. 430. His son, Alexander Yurovsky, voluntarily handed over his father's memoirs to amateur investigators Avdonin and Ryabov in 1978.Massie, p. 28. Lenin saw the House of Romanov as \\"monarchist filth, a 300-year disgrace\\", and referred to Nicholas II in conversation and in his writings as \\"the most evil enemy of the Russian people, a bloody executioner, an Asiatic gendarme\\" and \\"a crowned robber.\\"Rappaport, p. 137. A written record outlining the chain of command and tying the ultimate responsibility for the fate of the Romanovs back to Lenin was either never made or carefully concealed. Lenin operated with extreme caution, his favored method being to issue instructions in coded telegrams, insisting that the original and even the telegraph ribbon on which it was sent be destroyed. Uncovered documents in Archive No. 2 (Lenin), Archive No. 86 (Sverdlov) as well as the archives of the Council of People's Commissars and the Central Executive Committee reveal that a host of party 'errand boys' were regularly designated to relay his instructions, either by confidential notes or anonymous directives made in the collective name of the Council of People's Commissars. In all such decisions Lenin regularly insisted that no written evidence be preserved. The 55 volumes of Lenin's Collected Works as well as the memoirs of those who directly took part in the murders were scrupulously censored, emphasizing the roles of Sverdlov and Goloshchyokin. Lenin was, however, aware of Vasily Yakovlev's decision to take Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria further on to Omsk instead of Yekaterinburg in April 1918, having become worried about the extremely threatening behavior of the Ural Soviets in Tobolsk and along the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Biographical Chronicle of Lenin's political life confirms that first Lenin (between 6 and 7 pm) and then Lenin and Sverdlov together (between 9:30 and 11:50 pm) had direct telegraph contact with the Ural Soviets about Yakovlev's change of route. Despite Yakovlev's request to take the family further away to the more remote Simsky Gorny District in Ufa province (where they could hide in the mountains), warning that \\"the baggage\\" would be destroyed if given to the Ural Soviets, Lenin and Sverdlov were adamant that they be brought to Yekaterinburg.Rappaport, p. 139. On 16 July, the editors of Danish newspaper Nationaltidende queried Lenin to \\"kindly wire facts\\" in regards to a rumour that Nicholas II \\"has been murdered\\"; he responded, \\"Rumor not true.

Soviet historiography portrayed Nicholas as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects, while Lenin's reputation was protected at all costs, thus ensuring that no discredit was brought on him; responsibility for the 'liquidation' of the Romanov family was directed at the Ural Soviets and Yekaterinburg Cheka.

The names of Maria (third from right) and Alexei (far left) on the wall do not have a burial date inscribed at the bottom. Early the next morning, when rumors spread in Yekaterinburg about the disposal site, Yurovsky removed the bodies and hid them elsewhere (). When the vehicle carrying the bodies broke down on the way to the next chosen site, Yurovsky made new arrangements, and buried most of the acid-covered bodies in a pit sealed and concealed with rubble, covered over with railroad ties and then earth () on Koptyaki Road, a cart track (subsequently abandoned) north of Yekaterinburg. On the afternoon of 19 July, Filipp Goloshchyokin announced at the Opera House on Glavny Prospekt that \\"Nicholas the bloody\\" had been shot and his family taken to another place.Rappaport, p. 206. Sverdlov granted permission for the local paper in Yekaterinburg to publish the \\"Execution of Nicholas, the Bloody Crowned Murderer ‚Äì Shot without Bourgeois Formalities but in Accordance with our new democratic principles\\", along with the coda that \\"the wife and son of Nicholas Romanov have been sent to a safe place\\".Rappaport, p. 207. An official announcement appeared in the national press, two days later. It reported that the monarch had been executed on the order of Uralispolkom under pressure posed by the approach of the Czechoslovaks. Over the course of 84 days after the Yekaterinburg murders, 27 more friends and relatives (14 Romanovs and 13 members of the imperial entourage and household)King & Wilson, Epilogue section. were murdered by the Bolsheviks: at Alapayevsk on 18 July,Massie, p. 251. Perm on 4 September, and the Peter and Paul Fortress on 24 January 1919. Unlike the imperial family, the bodies at Alapayevsk and Perm were recovered by the White Army in October 1918 and May 1919 respectively.Rappaport, p. 213. However, only the final resting places of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna and her faithful companion Sister Varvara Yakovleva are known today, buried alongside each other in the Church of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. Although official Soviet accounts place the responsibility for the decision with the Uralispolkom, an entry in Leon Trotsky's diary reportedly suggested that the order had been given by Lenin himself. Trotsky wrote: However, , there has been no conclusive evidence that either Lenin or Sverdlov gave the order. V. N. Solovyov, the leader of the Investigative Committee of Russia's 1993 investigation on the shooting of the Romanov family, has concluded that there is no reliable document that indicates that either Lenin or Sverdlov were responsible. He declared: In 1993, the report of Yakov Yurovsky from 1922 was published. According to the report, units of the Czechoslovak Legion were approaching Yekaterinburg. On 17 July 1918, Yakov and other Bolshevik jailers, fearing that the Legion would free Nicholas after conquering the town, murdered him and his family. The next day, Yakov departed for Moscow with a report to Sverdlov. As soon as the Czechoslovaks seized Yekaterinburg, his apartment was pillaged. Over the years, a number of people claimed to be survivors of the ill-fated family. In May 1979, the remains of most of the family and their retainers were found by amateur enthusiasts, who kept the discovery secret until the collapse of Communism.Massie, pp. 32‚Äì35. In July 1991, the bodies of five family members (the Tsar, Tsarina, and three of their daughters) were exhumed.Massie, pp. 40 ff.

Boris Yeltsin and his wife attended the funeral along with Romanov relations, including Prince Michael of Kent. The Holy Synod opposed the government's decision in February 1998 to bury the remains in the Peter and Paul Fortress, preferring a \\"symbolic\\" grave until their authenticity had been resolved. As a result, when they were interred in July 1998, they were referred to by the priest conducting the service as \\"Christian victims of the Revolution\\" rather than the imperial family.Rappaport, p. 221. Patriarch Alexy II, who felt that the Church was sidelined in the investigation, refused to officiate at the burial and banned bishops from taking part in the funeral ceremony. The remaining two bodies of Tsesarevich Alexei and one of his sisters were discovered in 2007. On 15 August 2000, the Russian Orthodox Church announced the canonization of the family for their \\"humbleness, patience and meekness\\". However, reflecting the intense debate preceding the issue, the bishops did not proclaim the Romanovs as martyrs, but passion bearers instead (see Romanov sainthood). Over the years 2000 to 2003, the Church of All Saints, Yekaterinburg was built on the site of Ipatiev House. On 1 October 2008, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled that Nicholas II and his family were victims of political repression and rehabilitated them.BBCNews (1 October 2008). Russia's last tsar rehabilitated. Retrieved on 1 October 2008.Blomfield, Adrian (1 October 2008). Russia exonerates Tsar Nicholas II The Telegraph. The rehabilitation was denounced by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, vowing the decision will \\"sooner or later be corrected\\". On Thursday, 26 August 2010, a Russian court ordered prosecutors to reopen an investigation into the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, although the Bolsheviks believed to have shot them in 1918 had died long before. The Russian Prosecutor General's main investigative unit said it had formally closed a criminal investigation into the killing of Nicholas because too much time had elapsed since the crime and because those responsible had died. However, Moscow's Basmanny Court ordered the re-opening of the case, saying that a Supreme Court ruling blaming the state for the killings made the deaths of the actual gunmen irrelevant, according to a lawyer for the Tsar's relatives and local news agencies. In late 2015, at the insistence by the Russian Orthodox Church, Russian investigators exhumed the bodies of Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra, for additional DNA testing, which confirmed that the bones were of the couple. A survey conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center on 11 July 2018 revealed that 57% of Russians aged 35+ \\"believe that the execution of the Royal family is a heinous unjustified crime\\", 46% among those aged between 18 and 24 believe that Nicholas II had to be punished for his mistakes, and 3% \\"were certain that the Royal family's execution was the public's just retribution for the emperor's blunders\\". On the centenary of the murders, over 100,000 pilgrims took part in a procession led by Patriarch Kirill in Yekaterinburg, marching from the city center where the Romanovs were murdered to a monastery in Ganina Yama. There is a widespread legend that the remains of the Romanovs were completely destroyed at the Ganina Yama during the ritual murder and a profitable pilgrimage business developed there. Therefore, the found remains of the martyrs, as well as the place of their burial in the Porosyonkov Log, are ignored. On the eve of the anniversary Russian government announced that its new probe had confirmed once again that the bodies were the Romanovs‚Äô. The state also remained aloof from the celebration, as Putin considers Nicholas II a weak ruler.

At Munich he was also director of the municipal district maternity hospital and school for midwives. In 1874/75 he served as university rector. From 1877 he worked with Carl Siegmund Franz Cred√© (1819‚Äì1892) and Alfred Hegar (1830‚Äì1914) for the creation of an independent gynecological society, but it wasn't until 1885, three years after his death, when the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Gyn√§kologie was established.

Background Myllar was a burgess of Edinburgh and a bookseller, but perhaps combined the sale of books with some other occupation. On 29 March 1503 the sum of 10 Scots pounds was paid by the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland \\"to Andro Millar for thir bukis undirwritten, viz., Decretum Magnum, Decretales Sextus cum Clementinis, Scotus super quatuor libris Sententiarum, Quartum Scoti, Opera Gersonis in tribus voluminibus.\\" Another payment of fifty shillings was made on 22 December 1507 \\"for 3 prentit bukis to the King, tane fra Andro Millaris wyff.\\" An adjacent tablet commemorates Chepman The first book on which Myllar's name appears is an edition, printed in 1505, of Joannes de Garlandia's Multorum vocabulorum equiuocorum interpretation, of which the only copy known is in the Biblioth√®que Nationale at Paris. It has a colophon which states that Androw Myllar, a Scotsman, had been solicitous that the work should be printed with admirable art and corrected with diligent care. The second book is the Expositio Sequentiarum, according to the use of Sarum, printed in 1506, the copy of which in the British Museum is believed to be unique. The last page contains Myllar's punning device, representing a windmill with the miller ascending the outside ladder and carrying a sack of grain upon his back. Beneath is the printer's monogram and name. These two books were undoubtedly printed abroad. M. Claudin, who discovered them, and Dr. Dickson have ascribed them to the press of Laurence Hostingue of Rouen; but Gordon Duff has produced evidence to show that they should rather be assigned to that of Pierre Violette, another printer at Rouen. It was probably due to the influence of William Elphinstone the Bishop of Aberdeen, who was engaged in preparing an adaptation of the Sarum breviary for the use of his diocese, that James IV on 15 September 1507 granted a patent to Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar \\"to furnis and bring hame ane prent, with all stuff belangand tharto, and expert men to use the samyne, for imprenting within our Realme of the bukis of our Lawis, actis of parliament, croniclis, mess bukis, and portuus efter the use of our Realme, with addicions and legendis of Scottis sanctis, now gaderit to be ekit tharto, and al utheris bukis that salbe sene necessar, and to sel the sammyn for competent pricis.\\" Printing The Porteous of Nobleness Chepman having found the necessary capital, and Myllar having obtained the type from France, probably from Rouen, they set up their press in a house at the foot of Blackfriars Wynd, in the Southgait, now the Cowgate, of Edinburgh, and on 4 April 1508 issued the first book known to have been printed in Scotland, The Maying or Disport of Chaucer, better known as The Complaint of the Black Knight, and written not by Chaucer but by Lydgate. This tract consists of fourteen leaves, and has Chepman's device on the title-page, and Myllar's device at the end. The only copy known has been held in the Library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh since 1788. Bound with this work are ten other unique pieces, eight of which are also from the Southgait press, but two only of all are perfect, The Maying or Disport of Chaucer and The Goldyn Targe of William Dunbar. Four of the tracts bear the devices both of Chepman and of Myllar, and three others that of Myllar alone. The titles of the other pieces, two only of which are dated, are as follows: # The Knightly Tale of Golagros and Gawane, 8 April 1508 # The Porteous of Nobleness, a translation of \\"Le Br√©viaire des nobles\\" by Alain Chartier, 20 April 1508 # Syr Eglamoure of Artoys # The Goldyn Targe, by William Dunbar # Ane Buke of Gude Counsale to the King # The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy # The Tale of Orpheus and Erudices his Quene, by Robert Henryson # The Ballade of Lord Barnard Stewart, by William Dunbar Old Town of Edinburgh Two other pieces, The Tretis of the Twa Mariit Wemen and the Wedo, also by Dunbar, and A Gest of Robyn Hode, are contained in the same volume, but they are printed with different types, and there is no evidence to prove that they emanated from the first Scottish press. About two years later, in 1510, the Aberdeen Breviary, the main cause of the introduction of printing into Scotland, was executed by the command and at the expense of Walter Chepman; but doubt exists as to the actual printer of this, the last but most important work of the primitive Scottish press. Neither in connection with the Breviary nor elsewhere does Androw Myllar's name again occur.
