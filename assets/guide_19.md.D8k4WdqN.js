The band has gone through numerous lineup changes over the subsequent years, with only Kevin Seconds and Steve Youth remaining constant members. The final lineup of 7 Seconds was Kevin Seconds (vocals), Steve Youth (bass), Troy Mowat (drums), and Bobby Adams (guitar). History =Formation= 7 Seconds was formed on January 17, 1980, by two sets of brothers; the Marvelli brothers, using the punk rock names \\"Kevin Seconds\\" and \\"Steve Youth,\\" and the Borghino brothers, who were known as \\"Tom Munist\\" and \\"Dim Menace.\\" Asked about the origins of the band's name in a December 1982 interview with Flipside magazine, Kevin Seconds recalled: > \\"...I was ordering The Dils single \\"198 Seconds of The Dils\\" from Bomp and I > wrote it on a desk and the ink it said 97 Seconds; and then we saw this > movie Day of the Jackals or something and all through it there were > references to 7 Seconds, and the Dils were like our idols...

The band's early releases were several EPs including 1982's Skins, Brains and Guts, most of which were later re-released on the alt.music.hardcore and Old School compilation CDs.Martin C. Strong, The Great Alternative & Indie Discography, Canongate, 1999; pp. 552-553 All three demos were released on a bootleg release named 7 Seconds - Hardcore Rules, 80-82. They also appeared on the 1985 hardcore compilation Cleanse the Bacteria, in addition to numerous other compilations, such as Not So Quiet On the Western Front (Alt. Tentacles, 1982), Something to Believe In (BYO, 1984), Party or Go Home/We Got Power (Mystic, 1983), and Nuke Your Dink (Positive Force, 1984). They became closely associated with the Straight Edge movement and helped start the Youth Crew movement in 1984 with The Crew. Their first full-length album, The Crew, was recorded in 1983-84 and released by BYO Records, as was its successor - the classic hardcore EP Walk Together Rock Together. With the New Wind album, the band dramatically expanded its sound and style with audible elements of a sometimes quieter, slower, more melodic and accessible sound. Many writers have credited this particular period of 7 Seconds' career as being highly influential on many pop punk and indie rock bands that came along much later. Subsequent LPs moved deeper into mainstream territory with a U2-like sound. The 7 Seconds album continued their musical experimentation. The band broke free in 1995 with The Music, The Message, moving back somewhat into their roots. The Music, The Message was released on Sony (BMI), the first release on a major label throughout the band's history. Earlier material was on various homegrown labels, completely self-produced, or put out on Kevin Seconds own label, Positive Force Records (AKA United Front), before BYO Records housed them. However, the band returned to an old-school hardcore sound in 1999 with the Good to Go album. 2005 came the release of Take It Back, Take It On, Take It Over! on SideOneDummy, completing the evolution back to their Hardcore roots. =Legacy= 7 Seconds is believed to be the first band to refer to themselves primarily as hardcore. After their first show on March 2, 1980, in Newsletter NWIN/SPUNK No. 1 they described their band as hardcore new wave. Live at Hadad's Lake, Best Friends Day RVA, 2011 Vocalist Kevin Seconds has gone on to have a lengthy solo career, becoming an important folk punk singer too, doing releases with people including Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio and Mike Scott of Lay It on the Line (band). Dim Menace's fist-brandishing scowl on the cover of the Skins, Brains, & Guts EP is one of the most iconic images in hardcore. Sacramento News & Review speaks at length of their influence in the positive hardcore movement and their positive effect on the punk culture. In May 2013 it was announced that 7 Seconds had signed to Rise Records, with plans to record a new 7\\" and a full-length album that summer in Sacramento. =Break up= On March 20, 2018, 7 Seconds announced their breakup via their official Facebook page.

Early life and education Michaels was born in New York City to Jewish parents; his father was born in Poland. He attended New York University and was awarded a BA degree, and then went on to earn an MA and PhD in English literature from the University of Michigan. After receiving his doctorate, Leonard Michaels moved to Berkeley, California, where he was to spend most of his adult life and become Professor of English at the University of California. Michaels would later explain literary theory to magazine readers across America. Literary career In 1969, Michael's first book was published – Going Places, a collection of short stories. His follow-up book, another collection of short stories, was I Would Have Saved Them If I Could, published in 1975. It was considered by some as strong as Michaels' debut. Michaels' first novel, released in 1981, was The Men's Club. It is story-like comedy that simultaneously attacks and celebrates the absurdities of men as they gather in a kind of urban support group. In 1986, the novel was made into a film, directed by Peter Medak, with the screenplay by Michaels, and starring Roy Scheider, Harvey Keitel, Stockard Channing, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Frank Langella. Michaels' second and last novel was published in 1992. Titled Sylvia, it is a fictionalized memoir of his first wife, Sylvia Bloch, who committed suicide. Sylvia is described in the book as \\"abnormally bright\\" but prone to violent rages, \\"like a madwoman imitating a college student.\\" Sylvia incorporates passages from Michaels' diary, a selection of which was published under the title Time Out of Mind in 1999. Michaels became a regular contributor to the New Yorker magazine in the 1990s. Other information Michaels was a Professor of English at the University of California, Davis. He took part in anti-Vietnam war protests in the San Francisco Bay area, although he also accepted a description of himself as an 'unpolitical man'. He is interred at Oakmont Memorial Park, in Lafayette, California. Michaels had a daughter with his third wife, the poet Brenda Hillman. His son Jesse Michaels (from his second marriage) was the vocalist and primary lyricist in the seminal underground punk rock band Operation Ivy.

He was a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government from 1956 to 1957. He was the father of Dick Spring, who led the Labour Party from 1982 to 1997.  Early Life  Spring was born into a working-class family in Tralee, County Kerry. He left school at the age of 14 and began his working life with a series of low-skilled jobs. When he was working at a mill, he became involved in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) and after a while became a trade union official. He married Anna Laide (1919–1997) in 1943. Spring was a Gaelic football player, and was the captain of the Tralee Kerins O'Rahilly's team with whom he won two Kerry Senior Football Championship titles. He first played with Kerry when he won Munster and All-Ireland Junior titles in 1930.https://munster.gaa.ie/history/junior- football/ and captain of the Kerry county side when they won the All-Ireland final in 1940.  Politics  Through his involvement with the ITGWU he became well-known enough to stand in Kerry North for the Labour Party at the 1943 general election. He was elected as the first Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) in Kerry ever and held his seat until he retired in 1981. In 1944, Spring was among a group of six TDs who broke away from the Labour Party because it was allegedly infiltrated by communists and formed a new party they called the National Labour Party. The Labour Party and the National Labour Party reunited in 1950, having worked alongside each other in the First Inter-Party Government since 1948. In 1956, during the term of the Second Inter-Party Government Spring was promoted to Parliamentary Secretary, which he held until the government ended in 1957. For the rest of his political career Spring never held any significant post on a national level, and as a relatively conservative rural Labour man he fell out of step with the official line of the Labour Party, which moved significantly to the left during the 1960s and 1970s. During a vote on contraception, Spring famously said that on the day of the vote, his constituents would see how he stood on the issue. On the day of the vote, he appeared as a barrister in a court far away from the parliament. Spring concentrated on his constituency work and was returned in every election he stood in until he retired in 1981, his son Dick then successfully contesting the seat.

The system was an amalgamation of a number of railways that were incorporated in 1864, 1865 and 1904. The Cambrian connected with two of the larger railways to give connections to the northwest of England via the London and North Western Railway, and with the Great Western Railway for connections between London and Wales. The Cambrian Railways amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922 as a result of the Railways Act 1921. The name is continued today in the route known as the Cambrian Line.  History  = Creation of the Cambrian Railways: 1864 = The Cambrian Railways Company was created on 25 July 1864 when the Cambrian Railways Act of Parliament received Royal Assent. The new company was formed by amalgamating most of the existing railway companies in mid Wales: the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway and the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway. The shareholders of these constituent companies became the shareholders in the new Cambrian Railways Company. The was not included in the amalgamation because it was still under construction. In all, the new company had lines totalling in length. As well as incorporating existing railways, the new company had agreements to share traffic with the Mid-Wales Railway, the Manchester and Milford Railway and the Great Western Railway. This allowed it to control the transportation of goods and passengers across mid Wales. = Early years: 1864–1869 = The Cambrian Railways system Circa 1921 map of the Cambrian Railways =Constituent railways= The earliest section of the Cambrian was the section from Three Cocks to Talyllyn Junction. This had been opened in 1816 as part of the Hay Railway, a tramroad worked by horses connecting the town of Hay-on-Wye with the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal at Brecon. The western section was sold to the Brecon and Merthyr Railway; the eastern section became part of the Mid- Wales Railway (see below). In the following list the dates are: date of incorporation; opening date * Oswestry and Newtown Railway : 6 June 1855; 1860–61 * Llanidloes and Newtown Railway : 4 August 1853; 1859. Until 1861 this section of the line was isolated * Newtown and Machynlleth Railway : 27 July 1857; 1863 * Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway : 1 August 1861; 1863–1864 * : 26 July 1861; 1863–1869 * Mid-Wales Railway : 1 August 1859; 1 September 1864. This railway was independent of the Cambrian until 1 January 1888, when the latter took over working the line. On 1 July 1904 the two railways amalgamated. * Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway ; opened in 1895. Wrexham was the largest town served by the Cambrian. * Van Railway (serving lead mines) : built 1871 * Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway : gauge: opened 4 April 1903; closed to all traffic on 5 November 1956: reopened as a heritage railway. * Tanat Valley Light Railway (Llynclys to Llangynog) : opened 5 January 1904: closed to passengers 1951 * Mawddwy Railway : incorporated 5 July 1865: closed to passengers 1931; closed 1951 * Vale of Rheidol Railway : gauge: built 1902, absorbed 1913. =Branch lines= * Abermule to Kerry * Barmouth Junction to Dolgellau * Llanymynech to Llanfyllin Branch (The information in this section was taken largely from The Railway Year Book 1912.)

The building still stands today, although detached from modern network main railway lines, and was in use for commercial purposes until 2004. After restoration in 2005, this building was reopened as the Cambrian Visitor Centre in June 2006; but on 11 January 2008 closed due to the terms of the lease not being settled. It has since reopened and, amongst other things, is being used as the headquarters for the newly formed Cambrian Heritage Railways (CHR) restoration project. station in 1962 The largest station premises on the line were at (part of which has been restored and reopened as a J D Wetherspoon in the mid-2000s). Locomotives Former Cambrian Railways workshops, Oswestry. Now an antiques warehouse The \\"latest Cambrian Passenger Express Locomotive\\", circa 1921 On vesting its headquarters in July 1865 in Oswestry, the company built the Cambrian railways works to the north of the station on Gobowen Road. Its construction hastened Oswestry's boom as a railway town, from a population of 5,500 in 1861, to nearly 10,000 in 1901. Built of local red brick and costing £28,000, the locomotive erecting shop had a central traverser which was hand- operated, serving 12 roads on each side. On the far north end of the works, 11 sidings accessed a carriage and wagon works. Power to the machines was provided by a large steam engine via overhead shafting and belts. The chimney is still a local landmark. Whilst many carriages and wagons were built in the workshops, only two locomotives were actually constructed at Oswestry. After the Cambrian Railways was taken over by the GWR on grouping in 1923, the GWR kept the works open as a regional carriage and wagon works, and locomotive repair shop for the associated locomotive shed. In 1911 there were 91 locomotives and one rail motor car in the Cambrian's rolling stock. At grouping in 1922, 94 standard-gauge engines and five narrow-gauge engines were transferred to the GWR, identified by type and builder at Locomotives of the Great Western Railway. After becoming part of the London Midland Region in 1963, the depot closed in January 1965, the works in early 1966. A Grade II listed building, the works today is an antiques centre, small business hub and document storage centre.  Accidents  Bettisfield Station in 1962 *On 1 January 1883, a passenger train was struck by a landslide at Friog, Merionethshire. The locomotive and its tender are pushed into the sea. Both crew were killed. *On 11 June 1897, a passenger train was derailed at Welshampton, Shropshire due to a combination of defective track and excessive speed. Twelve people were killed. *On 17 January 1918, two freight trains were in a head-on collision at Parkhall, Shropshire due to irregular operation of tablet instruments by signalmen at Oswestry North and Ellesmere Junction signal boxes. The design of the circuitry connecting the instruments and the weather were contributory factors. *A head-on collision occurred at Abermule on 26 January 1921, killing 15 passengers, including Lord Herbert Vane- Tempest, chairman of the company and son of the fifth Marquess of Londonderry. The accident was caused by a confusion amongst the staff at Abermule whereby the driver of the train in the station was given back the token he had just handed over, for the section of track he had just travelled over – it would not have been possible to give him the token for the next section. The driver did not check which token he had and set off. He soon collided with the Aberystwyth to Manchester express coming the other way, which had the token for that section. Legacy today A registered museum dedicated to the history of the Cambrian Railways is run by Cambrian Heritage Railways in Oswestry. No. 247 at Chinnor Railway station. A selection of original Cambrian Railways coaches have survived into the present day. Coaches 4, 251 and an unidentified saloon/brake car all stand in private residence. No. 9 is in private storage. No. 110 is being restored to service on the Swindon and Cricklade Railway. No. 238 and an unidentified six-wheel brake resides with the National Museums & Galleries of Wales. No. 247 is currently being used as the café at Chinnor station on the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway and No. 250 as a museum on the neighbouring Cholsey and Wallingford Railway having formerly been the Wallingford station café. Both No. 247 and No. 250 are grounded bodies. An unidentified first class passenger body also stands on the Tanat Valley Light Railway. A full brake car, No. 104, was recovered in August 2018 and currently resides on the Swindon and Cricklade Railway awaiting restoration. No Cambrian standard-gauge locomotives still exist. A road in Brecon which runs off the B4601 and over a part of the former line is known as Cambrian Way in commemoration of it.

It has been the home ground of Scottish Premiership side St Johnstone since its opening in 1989. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of . As well as St Johnstone matches, McDiarmid Park has been chosen to host the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup on nine occasions. It has also been used for rugby union, including a full international between Scotland and Japan in 2004, several Scotland A fixtures, and some home matches of the former Caledonia Reds team. History St Johnstone had played at Muirton Park since 1924, but it had fallen into disrepair by the 1980s. St Johnstone was then a Second Division club and did not have the funds to repair it. In December 1986 the club received the news that Asda wanted to purchase Muirton Park and the adjoining ice rink to build a supermarket on the site. In return, the club would be relocated, at no cost to them, to a brand-new stadium at the western edge of the city. A local farmer, Bruce McDiarmid, donated 16 acres of land at his Newton of Huntingtower Farm, on which the stadium now stands. The going rate for the land at that time would have been approximately £400,000 but Bruce McDiarmid saw a donation of his \\"berry and barley fields\\" as a gift to the people of Perth. At the insistence of St Johnstone he accepted a 20 per cent shareholding and the title of honorary president of the football club. The Taylor Report noted that there had been a happy \\"confluence of factors\\" that allowed St Johnstone to make this development. McDiarmid died in 1999, aged 88.Bruce McDiarmid - The Herald, 22 October 1999 The stadium was designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall and built by Miller Construction.Official match programme: St Johnstone v. Manchester United, 17 October 1989 The stadium was a prototype and based on legislative advice that was soon to become out of date, but a good facility was built for a reasonable cost. Work started on the Tulloch farmland donated by Bruce McDiarmid in December 1988 and was finished in time for the start of the 1989–90 season. Although McDiarmid Park was opened after the Hillsborough disaster, all of the planning and most of the construction work had been done beforehand. Lord Justice Taylor visited the ground as part of his inquiry into the disaster. The first match at McDiarmid Park was played on 19 August 1989, a 2–1 victory for Saints in a First Division match against Clydebank. This league fixture on the opening day of the season was deliberately kept low-key as a glamour challenge match had been arranged for the official opening. On 17 October 1989, St Johnstone lined up against English club Manchester United, who brought a full strength side to Scotland. The Manchester United team, managed by former St Johnstone player Alex Ferguson, included Jim Leighton, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Bryan Robson, Paul Ince, Brian McClair, Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe. McClair scored the only goal of the game, in front of a near capacity (9,780) crowd.Official match programme: St Johnstone v. Partick Thistle, 28 October 1989 The legendary Sir Matt Busby and Bobby Charlton were also in attendance. With just 30 minutes played of the match, the stadium was temporarily plunged into darkness caused by a fault at an electricity substation. Although the stadium's emergency generators were able to provide lighting in the stands, it was 23 minutes before play was resumed. St Johnstone enjoyed great success when the stadium first opened. The club won promotion to the Premier Division in their first season at McDiarmid. In the first season back in the top flight, the average attendance at McDiarmid was 6,000, approximately three times what it had been at Muirton. These high attendances led the club to create space for another 600 seats, raising the capacity to over 10,700. A record home attendance of 10,721 was set by a home game against Rangers on 26 February 1991. McDiarmid Park also hosted matches of the Scotland under-21 team and the Scotland women's national team. By the mid-1990s, however, attendances had drifted down to below 4,000, although this was still nearly double what they had been at Muirton. In 2011, plans to demolish the 2,000 capacity North Stand were publicised. This would have allowed a commuter link road from the neighbouring A9 road to be built. St Johnstone chairman Geoff Brown justified the proposal on the grounds that comparable clubs, such as Inverness and St Mirren, have since built grounds with smaller capacities. The proposals were rejected by Perth and Kinross Council. Structure and facilities Aberdeen at McDiarmid Park in 2001. View is from the North Stand. McDiarmid Park, the first purpose-built all-seater stadium in the United Kingdom, consists of four covered, single-tier stands. Facilities include parking for 1,000 cars and 100 coaches, a synthetic playing surface adjacent to the ground (which is used as the team's training ground), and conference facilities within the Main (West) Stand. The stands are all of a similar height, with the Main Stand, on the western side of the ground, being slightly taller. The Main Stand also has greater leg room between rows of seats and includes an area with padded seats reserved for season-ticket holders, club officials and their guests. In the north-east corner of the ground there is an electronic scoreboard. The floodlights at McDiarmid are the same ones used at Muirton Park. The club also tried to retain the square goalposts used at Muirton, but the timber frames could not be re-erected. The South Stand is named the Ormond Stand, after Willie Ormond, a successful manager of St Johnstone who left the club in 1973 to manage Scotland. The Ormond Stand also houses the club's souvenir shop, which is only open on match days before and after the match. It was formerly nominated as a \\"family stand\\", for home fans and fans of the visiting club to sit together. The club has a number of options for housing visiting fans. Visiting supports of a few hundred or less are housed in a segregated section at the north end of the main stand, with the two end stands closed. Clubs who regularly bring a larger support are also allocated the North Stand. If a very large visiting support is expected the club has a further option to also open the Ormond Stand for away fans. Being a prototype stadium, McDiarmid Park has some faults that critics of seated stadia picked upon. Spectators in the front rows of the stands are not necessarily sheltered, while the stadium has been criticised for lacking atmosphere. St Johnstone are routinely praised for their pricing structure especially for visiting families sitting in the Ormond/Family stand. Other uses A view of McDiarmid Park from the car park, looking north-east =Scottish League Challenge Cup Final= The final of the Challenge Cup is often held at McDiarmid Park because of its capacity and the fair distance it is in relation to most teams who have contested the cup in the SPFL. McDiarmid Park isn't the sole host as finals have also been played at Fir Park (Motherwell), Broadwood Stadium (Cumbernauld), Excelsior Stadium (Airdrie) Easter Road Stadium (Edinburgh), Caledonian Stadium (Inverness), and Almondvale Stadium (Livingston). =Rugby Union= Professional rugby union side Caledonia Reds played some of their home games at McDiarmid Park before they were merged with the Glasgow Warriors in 1998. The merged Warriors initially played some of their 1999 games in Perth, but eventually switched all home games to Glasgow. On 13 November 2004 the Scotland national rugby union team played Japan there in a historic first test match north of the River Forth. The result was a 100–8 scoreline in favour of Scotland, the first time the Scottish rugby team had scored a century. Chris Paterson scored 40 points (three tries, 11 conversions and one penalty). The stadium has hosted several of Scotland's \\"A\\" team: a victory over Italy in 1999, a draw over Argentina in 1999, a win against Samoa in 2000, and a loss to Italy in 2003. On 21 November 2006, Scotland \\"A\\" faced Australia in Perth, their first appearance on home soil in three years. On 23 February 2007, Scotland \\"A\\" hosted Italy at McDiarmid Park.Rugby returns to McDiarmid Park =Non-sporting usage= For many years the stadium hosted the Scottish convention of Jehovah's Witnesses, which brought thousands of worshippers to the local area every summer. In July 2009, a mass baptism was held, which included the use of a pool. Over 8,000 people attended the three-day event. The 2012 convention was their last year at the stadium as the religious organisation opted to use The SSE Hydro arena at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow for their national convention. On 6 July 2008, Elton John became the first musician to play at the stadium.

Origin  During the High Middle Ages, European knights were essentially armoured, mounted warriors; by virtue of its defining characteristic of subinfeudation, in feudalism it was common practice for knights commander to confer knighthoods upon their finest soldiers, who in turn had the right to confer knighthood on others upon attaining command. For most of the Middle Ages, it was possible for private individuals to form orders of chivalry. The oldest existing order of chivalry, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, was formed as a private organization which later received official sanction from church and state. The 13th century witnessed the trend of monarchs, beginning with Emperor Frederick II (as King of Sicily) in 1231, retaining the right of fons honorum as a royal prerogative, gradually abrogating the right of knights to elevate their esquires to knighthood. After the end of feudalism and the rise of the nation- state, orders and knighthoods, along with titles of nobility (in the case of monarchies), became the domain of the monarchs (heads of state) to reward their loyal subjects (citizens) – in other words, the heads of state became their nations' \\"fountains of honour\\". Many of the old-style military knights resented what they considered to be a royal encroachment on their independence. The late British social anthropologist, Julian A. Pitt-Rivers, noted that \\"while the sovereign is the 'fount of honour' in one sense, he is also the enemy of honour in another, since he claims to arbitrate in regard to it.\\"Pitt-Rivers, Julian, \\"Honor and Social Status\\", in Jean G. Peristany, ed., Honour and Shame: The Values of Mediterranean Society, 20-77 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), 30. By the early thirteenth century, when an unknown author composed L'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal),Paul Meyer, L'Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal (Paris: Société de l'histoire de France, 1891–1901), with partial translation of the original sources into Modern French. Edition, History of William Marshal (3 vols): Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3. (a verse biography of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, often regarded as the greatest medieval English knight) Richard W. Kaeuper notes that \\"the author bemoans the fact that, in his day, the spirit of chivalry has been imprisoned; the life of the knight errant, he charges, has been reduced to that of the litigant in courts.\\" Legality of honours today The question whether an order is a legitimate chivalric order or a self-styled order coincides with the subject of the fons honorum. A legitimate fount of honour is a person or entity who holds sovereignty when the order is awarded; ultimately, it is the authority of the state, whether exercised by a reigning monarch or the president of a republic, that distinguishes orders of chivalry from private organizations. Other persons, whether commoners, knights, or noblemen, no longer have the right to confer titles of nobility, knighthood or orders of chivalry upon others. The official website of the British monarchyOfficial Website of the British Monarchy states: \\"As the 'fountain of honour' in the United Kingdom, The Queen has the sole right of conferring all titles of honour, including life peerages, knighthoods and gallantry awards.\\" Some private societies in the United Kingdom (such as the Royal Humane Society) have permission from the monarch to award medals which may be worn by those in uniform provided the private society's medal is worn on the right- side rather than the usual left. In Spain the fount of honour is King Felipe VI as the head of state. In France, only decorations recognised by the Grand Chancery of the Legion of Honour may be worn publicly, and permission must be sought and granted to wear any foreign awards or decorations. Dynastic orders are prohibited unless the dynasty in question is currently recognised as sovereign.Code de la légion d'honneur et de la médaille militaire, article R160 (For example, the Royal Victorian Order is explicitly recognised, whereas the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus is not.) Failure to comply is punishable by law. A non-exhaustive list of collectively authorised orders is published by the government. : \\"These two dispositions are meant to protect the ensemble of authentic national and foreign distinctions by attempting to prevent the attire of fake decorations. These may stem from territorial entities which have not acceded to sovereignty or even from countries, nations, empires or kingdoms that are the pure and simple products of someone's overactive imagination, a fan of fiction or even a megalomaniac, if not purely mercantile acts or even the patent intention to abuse and swindle others.\\" The President of the Portuguese Republic has inherited the duties of fount of honour from the Portuguese monarchs, since, unlike titles of nobility, the Portuguese orders of chivalry were not extinguished with the Republican Revolution in 1910. The current Constitution of Portugal alternatively styles the President as the \\"Grand Master of the Portuguese Honorific Orders\\" (); in this capacity, the President can wear as a private insignia the Sash of the Three Orders, which has become a symbol of the Portuguese presidential magistracy. The Papal Orders of Knighthood comprise five orders awarded directly by the Holy See and two others which it 'recognises and supports': the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In response to queries regarding the Catholic Church's relationship to a large number of self-proclaimed Roman Catholic chivalric orders, the Holy See issued a statement in 2012 stating that any body other than its own seven approved orders, 'whether of recent origin or mediaeval foundation, are not recognised by the Holy See' and that 'the Holy See does not guarantee their historical or juridical legitimacy, their ends or organisational structures... to prevent the continuation of abuses which may result in harm to people of good faith, the Holy See confirms that it attributes absolutely no value whatsoever to certificates of membership or insignia issued by these groups, and it considers inappropriate the use of churches or chapels for their so-called \\"ceremonies of investiture\\".'

Glacier Point is a viewpoint above Yosemite Valley in the U.S. state of California. It is located on the south wall of Yosemite Valley at an elevation of , above Half Dome Village. The point offers a superb view of several of Yosemite National Park's well-known landmarks, including Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls, Half Dome, Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall, and Clouds Rest. Between 1872 and 1968, it was the site of the Yosemite Firefall. Geology The extreme point of the promontory of Glacier Point is wholly bare, but on the slopes below, in the hollow to the west, and on the wooded slope above, glacial material is abundant. Its glacial origin is definitely proved by the presence in it of rocks derived from Little Yosemite Valley and the Sierra Nevada. There are three types of glacially- deposited rock at Glacier Point: #Most plentiful are rounded boulders and cobbles and angular fragments, all deeply weathered, of Half Dome quartz monzonite, the light-colored granite of which not only Half Dome, but all of the Little Yosemite and its surrounding heights are composed. #There are also a few boulders of a coarse-grained, highly siliceous granite, light buff in general tone when fresh but vivid rose when weathered. There is only one place in the High Sierra above the Yosemite from which they can be derived: Mount Clark, the sharp-profiled peak which stands on the east side of the Illilouette Basin, from Glacier Point. #Finally, there are fragments of yellowish quartzite and gray schist whose places of origin have been located on the long northern spur of Mount Clark. Access Location of Glacier Point within Yosemite Glacier Point can be reached from the Valley via Glacier Point Road. During the summer, Glacier Point is often crowded with tourists. Tours by bus are also available and take about four hours. The road is usually open from June through October. In winter, Glacier Point Road closes due to snow, and access to Glacier Point from the Badger Pass Ski Area is only by ski or snowshoe. Glacier Point can also be reached via the Four Mile Trail, which ascends the in . This moderate to strenuous trail can provide access to Glacier Point when the Glacier Point Road is closed. Note, however, that the trail can be extremely hazardous when covered with snow or ice, so it is usually closed by the Park Service from December through May. Another trail runs from Glacier Point down to the Valley, via the Panorama Trail, past Nevada and Vernal Falls. Hikers may also access trailheads to the Panorama trail and the Pohono trail.

Saint Walpurgis Night (or \\"Sankt Walpurgisnacht\\") is the name for the eve of her feast day, which coincides with May Day.  Early life  Walpurga was born in the county of Devon, England, into a local aristocratic family. She was the daughter of Saint Richard the Pilgrim, an underking of the West Saxons, and of Saint Wuna of Wessex, and had two brothers, Saint Willibald and Saint Winibald.Meyrick S.J., Thomas. A Life of St. Walpurg3, 1873  Religious career  Statue of Walburgis at Walburgis Kapelle at Kirchehrenbach, Germany In 721 Richard set out on a pilgrimage to Rome with his two sons. Before leaving he entrusted Walpurga, then 11 years old, to the abbess of the double monastery at Wimborne Abbey in Dorset. She had been there but a year, when she received word that her father had died at Lucca. After seeing to their father's burial in the Basilica of San Frediano, her brothers completed the pilgrimage to Rome, where they both became seriously ill. (Hygeburg, who wrote the Vita S. Willibaldi, says they contracted the Black Death; Francis Mershman suggests malaria).Mershman, Francis. \\"Sts. Willibald and Winnebald.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 Apr. 2019 After recovering, Winibald, who was not of a particularly strong constitution, remained at Rome to pursue further studies, while Willibald set out for the Holy Land. After about seven years of traveling, Willibald returned to Italy and became a monk at Monte Cassino. In 730, Winibald returned to England and engaged a third brother and several amongst his kindred and acquaintance to accompany him in his journey back to Rome to begin a monastic life there.Stevens, Clifford. The One Year Book of Saints, OSV Publishing During this time Walpurga remained at Wimborne where she was educated; and in the course of time became a nun. The nuns of Wimborne were skilled at copying and ornamenting manuscripts; and celebrated for Opus Anglicanum, a fine needlework utilizing gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen, often decorated with jewels and pearls. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe.Brownlow, Canon. \\"The Brother and Sister and Saint Willibald\\", Report and Transactions - The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art, Vol. 23, 1891, p. 228 She spent 26 years as a member of the community. In 737, Walpurga's uncle (her mother's brother), Saint Boniface, was in Rome and recruited his nephews to assist him in his religious work in Germany. Winnebald arrived in Thuringia on 30 November, 740, and after being ordained a priest, was placed in charge of seven churches.Butler, Alban. \\"Saint Winebald, Abbot and Confessor\\". Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 16 December 2013 Willibald, upon arriving at Eichstätt, was ordained by Boniface on 22 July, 741 and began missionary work in the area. Walpurga then travelled with her brothers, Willibald and Winibald, to Francia (now Württemberg and Franconia) to assist Saint Boniface in evangelizing the still-pagan Germans. Because of her rigorous training, she was able to write her brother Winibald's vita and an account in Latin of his travels in Palestine. As a result, she is often called the first female author of both England and Germany. Walpurga became a nun in the double monastery of Heidenheim am Hahnenkamm, which was founded by Willibald. He appointed her as his successor and following his death in 751, Walpurga became the abbess of the monastery. Upon Winibald's death in 760 she also succeeded him as superintendent of the Heidenheim monastery.  Death  Walpurga died on 25 February 777 or 779 (the records are unclear) and was buried at Heidenheim; the day carries her name in the Catholic church calendar. In 870, Walpurga's remains were transferred to Eichstätt. In Finland, Sweden, and Bavaria, her feast day commemorates the transfer of her relics on 1 May.  Veneration  St. Walburga Church in Bruges was originally a Jesuit church Walpurga's feast day is 25 February, but the day of her canonization, 1 May (possibly 870), was also celebrated during the high medieval period, especially in the 11th century under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, so that Walpurgis Night is the eve of May Day, celebrated in continental folklore with dancing. At Eichstätt, her bones were placed in a rocky niche, which allegedly began to exude a miraculously therapeutic oil, which drew pilgrims to her shrine. The two earliest miracle narratives of Walpurga are the Miracula S. Walburgae Manheimensis by Wolfhard von Herrieden, datable to 895 or 896, and the late 10th-century Vita secunda linked with the name of Aselbod, bishop of Utrecht. In the 14th-century Vita S. Walburgae by Phillipp von Rathsamhaüsen, bishop of Eichstätt (1306–22), the miracle of the tempest-tossed boat is introduced, which Peter Paul Rubens painted in 1610 for the altarpiece for the church of St. Walpurgis, Antwerp.the altarpiece is now disassembled. Susanne Heiland, \\"Two Rubens Paintings Rehabilitated\\" The Burlington Magazine, 111 No. 796 (July 1969:421-427) p. In addition, the 19th-century Cardinal Newman declared the exuded oil to be a credible miracle. Statue in Contern church. The earliest representation of Walpurga is in the early 11th-century Hitda Codex, made in Cologne, and depicts her holding stylized stalks of grain. In other depictions, the object has been called a palm branch which is not correct, since Walpurga was not martyred. The grain attribute has been interpreted as an instance of a Christian saint (Walpurga) coming to represent an older pagan concept; in this case, the pagan Grain Mother. Peasant farmers fashioned her replica in a corn dolly at harvest time and told tales to explain Saint Walpurga's presence in the grain sheaf.Pamela Berger, The Goddess Obscured: Transformation of the Grain Protectress from Goddess to Saint, 1985:61-64, gives several examples and bibliographical notes.  Patronage  Walpurga is the patroness of Eichstätt and Weilburg, Germany; Oudenarde, Veurne, Antwerp, Belgium; and Zutphen the Netherlands; and she is invoked as special patroness against hydrophobia, in storms, and also by sailors.Casanova, Gertrude. \\"St. Walburga\\".

Their early teaching efforts later resulted in the establishment and development of Villa Madonna Academy and Thomas More University. The Church of St. Walburge, a Catholic church in Preston, Lancashire, England, is a church famous for its spire. At , the spire is the tallest of any parish church in England, with only the spires of Salisbury and Norwich Cathedrals reaching higher.Morgan, Ann. \\"Local landmarks: St Walburge's\\", BBC, 15 August 2008 The St. Walburg's Hospital, a 220-bed hospital in southern Tanzania was built in 1959.  St. Walburga Church in Antwerp (Belgium)  Central in the first fortified city of Antwerp, from the 11th century, was the church dedicated to St. Walburga. Under French occupation in 1798, the church was confiscated and sold; it served as a warehouse. In 1816, the Dutch government confiscated the church building, and in 1817, it was demolished. The city mayor and aldermen decided to erect a statue of Pieter Paul Rubens on the burg square left after the demolition. In 1880, when the (current) Scheldt quais were built, most of the area of the first fortified city from the 11th century was demolished and even the foundations of the St. Walburga Church disappeared, and the statue was moved to the (current) Groenplaats. Some parts of the interior of that ancient church, which actively served for more than 700 years, were recovered: the altar piece painting The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens) and the predella (foot of the altar) have been reused in the main altar of the Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp). Another altar was moved to the :nl:Heikese kerk in Tilburg where it serves as the main altar.

For comparison, in 1920-1921 the peasants surrendered to the state 367 million poods (6,010,000 metric tons) of cereals through prodrazvyorstka, as opposed to 240 million poods (3,930,000 metric tons) in 1921-1922 through prodnalog. During the first year of introduction of prodnalog, a significant amount of bread and other products remained at peasant households' disposal, which provided an incentive for peasants to develop their own household economy, widen the sowing areas, increase the total number of livestock and productivity of crops. The rate of prodnalog on each kind of agricultural product was determined depending on local conditions and prosperity of a given peasant household. The Soviet state adhered to a policy of progressive taxation; the highest rate of prodnalog had to be paid by the kulak households. In March and April 1921, a number of Soviet Decrees introduced a natural tax on bread, potato, oilseeds, eggs, dairy products, wool, hides, flax and hemp linen, tobacco etc. The collection of agricultural goods in excess of prodnalog, if necessary, was intended to be made on a barter basis by giving peasants manufactured goods. In order to accelerate the expansion of commodity circulation, create necessary conditions for developing farming and industry and speed up the productive forces of the country, the government encouraged small-scale production all over Soviet Union. The introduction of prodnalog revived the trade and created a different kind of relations between the city and the village. By the decision of the 12th Congress of the RCP(b) (April 1923), prodnalog and other taxes in the rural areas were exchanged for a universal direct agricultural tax (decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom on May 10, 1923). The latter would be collected in monetary form starting in 1924, with the establishment of hard currency in the USSR.

It is a sub-prefecture of the Corrèze department. It has around 50,000 inhabitants, while the population of the urban area was 89,260 in 1999. Although it is by far the biggest commune in Corrèze, the capital is Tulle. In French popular culture, the town is associated with a song by Georges Brassens.  History  Even though the inhabitants settled around the 1st century, the city only started to grow much later. From around the 5th century onwards, the original city began to develop around a church dedicated to Saint-Martin-l'Espagnol. During the 12th century walls were built around the city and during the Hundred Years' War a second wall was built. These fortifications no longer exist and have been replaced by boulevards. The commune was named \\"Brive\\" until 1919, when it was renamed \\"Brive-la- Gaillarde\\". The word \\"Gaillarde\\" (still used in current French) probably stands for bravery or strength in the city's name, but it can also refer to the city's walls. Brive now extends outside of its original boundaries into Malemort and Ussac. During World War II, Brive-la-Gaillarde was a regional capital of the Resistance, acting as a seat of several clandestine information networks and several of the principal resistance movements, including the Armée secrète (or “Secret Army”) and the Mouvements Unis de la Résistance (or \\"United Movements of the Resistance\\"). Brive-la-Gaillarde was the first city of Occupied France to liberate itself by its own means, on 15 August 1944. For this, the city received the “Croix de guerre 1939–1945” military decoration. The medieval centre is mainly a commercial district with retail shops and various cafés. It is also the location of the city hall, the main police station, and the Labenche museum. One notable landmark outside the inner city is the Pont Cardinal, a bridge which used to be a crossing point for travelers from Paris to Toulouse.  Climate   Administration  The most recent mayors of Brive-la-Gaillarde were: * 1966–1995: Jean Charbonnel * 1995–2008: Bernard Murat * 2008–present: Philippe Nauche  Population   Transport  Brive-la-Gaillarde railway station offers connections to Limoges, Périgueux, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, and several regional destinations. The A20 motorway connects Brive with Limoges and Toulouse, the A89 with Bordeaux. Brive–Souillac Airport lies south of the city. It was opened in 2010 to replace the older Brive-La Roche Airport.  Sport  The city is home to a rugby union team, CA Brive. It also hosted the 2009 Junior World Rowing Championships.

Rising in the Ochil Hills, it runs through Strathallan to Dunblane and Bridge of Allan before joining the River Forth. It is liable to cause floods in lower Bridge of Allan.Allanwater Herald. Report gives options into flood reduction in Bridge of Allan. 3 July 2013. It shares its name with a tributary of the River Teviot. The name is similar to the Ale Water in Berwickshire, the River Alness in Ross-shire, the Allander Water in Stirlingshire, the River Alne and the Ayle Burn in Northumberland, the River Ellen in Cumbria, and several names in the south of England, Wales and Cornwall. Ptolemy, who wrote his Geography about 150 AD, gave the names of some of these rivers as Alauna or Alaunos.Müllerus, C (Ed) (1883) Claudii Ptolemaei Geographia, Paris. Ekwall says that Alauna or Alaunos are British [i.e. Brythonic or P-Celtic] river names.Ekwall, E (1960) The concise Oxford dictionary of English place-names, 4th edition. London: Oxford University Press. p.7 Nicolaisen says that the name Allan is of Pre-Celtic Indo-European origin. Its original form was Alauna, from the Indo-European root *el-/ol-, meaning \\"to flow, to stream\\". Several European rivers and settlements have names that may come from that root. Others say that Alauna was a Celtic river goddess, also found in Brittany;Monaghan, P (2004) The encyclopedia of Celtic mythology and folklore. New York: Facts on File. p.13 Alaunus was a Gaulish god of medicine and prophesy. Two broadside ballads refer to the \\"Allan Water\\". According to one, a Scottish ballad, the \\"Allan Water's wide and deep, and my dear Anny's very bonny; Wides the Straith that lyes above't, if't were mine I'de give it all for Anny.\\" The other, more familiar, English ballad begins \\"On the banks of Allan Water\\" and relates the death of a miller's daughter whose soldier lover proves untrue. This version, popularised by C. E. Horn in his comic opera, Rich and Poor (1812), is sung by Bathsheba Everdene at the sheepshearing supper in Thomas Hardy's novel Far From The Madding Crowd (1874). A similar rendition was recorded with church organ accompaniment by Italian singer Ariella Uliano in 2008. Industry The river and its tributaries were once extensively used to power mills and factories. The major tributaries, the Muckle Burn and River Knaik, are mainly in hilly sheep farming terrain and no significant industrial use was made of them. The Danny Burn tributary of the Allan, the Wauk Mill N890081 Wauk Mill appears to have been a small corn mill belonging to a local farm. Very little remains. (Pan around the same external link to find the other locations.) Progressing downstream, the mill buildings and weir at Kinbuck NN790051 still exist but are derelict. The weir NN785040 and some large mill buildings NN783038 at Ashfield still exist but are largely derelict. There are two substantial weirs in Dunblane, at NN770017, feeding the Springbank Mill NN770016, which still exists but is no longer a mill, and at NN780014. Downstream of Dunblane, a weir at NS785996 fed the long derelict Lower Keir Mill at NS785994. At Bridge of Allan there are still in existence three very substantial weirs, the upper of which, NS786981, formerly supplied the Airthrey Mills NS786968, while the middle (NS786977) weir was positioned to collect the outfall from the Airthrey Mills as well as the main flow of the river. The lower weir is at NS788976, and the middle and lower weirs supplied a changing assortment of mills and factories as recently as the 1950s. The area is now occupied by housing but many traces of the mill lades can still be seen, and the flow of water over the weirs remains impressive.

It was founded in 1983 to make microcars following the acquisition of Arola. On 11 April 2013, US based Polaris Industries announced that it had acquired Aixam-Mega from previous owners Axa Private Equity. History The company can trace its history back to the establishment of Arola in 1975, which was acquired by Aixam in 1983 out of administration. In 1984 Aixam launched the new 325D, followed by the 400D in 1985. In 1992 they started making a range of standard sized cars under the Mega brand, but by 2002 this brand was just being applied to a diesel and electric range of microvans and light utility vehicles. The company currently produces the Aixam A.7XX series (powered by Kubota diesel engines), a microcar comparable with the Smart. A notable difference is that some of the smaller models are restricted to and can be driven without a driving licence in some European countries (including Belgium, Estonia, France, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and Slovenia). In Britain they are classified as a category L7e quadricycle (quad bike) because of their weight and power output. This requires a category B1 licence to legally drive them. In January 2013, the law changed such that special restricted low power versions of the car (Aixam 400) can now be driven by full AM licence holders in the UK.Driving licence categories: Mopeds: Category AM \\"You can drive 2-wheeled or 3-wheeled vehicles...

It is native to rivers, estuaries and other coastal habitats of East Asia from Korea in the north to Fujian, China in the south. It has also been introduced to Europe and North America, where it is considered an invasive species. Description and ecology This species' distinguishing features are the dense patches of dark setae on its claws. The crab's body is the size of a human palm. The carapace is wide, and the legs are about twice as long as the carapace is wide. Mitten crabs spend most of their life in fresh water and return to the sea to breed. During their fourth or fifth year in late summer, the crustaceans migrate downstream and attain sexual maturity in the tidal estuaries. After mating, the females continue seaward, overwintering in deeper waters. They return to brackish water in the spring to hatch their eggs. After development as larvae, the juvenile crabs gradually move upstream into fresh water, thus completing the life cycle. It moves from freshwater habitats to saltwater habitats once it has reached reproduction maturity. The types of estuaries suitable for the mitten crab is large brackish waters for the larva to develop in, and large shallow waters for the growth of the juvenile crabs. An increase in microplastics has had a significant impact on the population as it effects their metabolism, growth, and oxidative stress response in the liver. The Chinese mitten crab originates from Hong Kong to the border of Korea. It can be found inland but prefers coastal areas. In the Yangtze, the largest river in its native range, Chinese mitten crabs have been recorded up to upstream.Veilleux, É; and de Lafontaine, Y. (2007). Biological Synopsis of the Chinese Mitten Crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Canadian Manuscript Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 2812. It is known to settle in rice fields by the sea and rivers inland. The crab is found in subtropical and temperate regions. Phylogenetically the crab belongs to the Varunidae family which is the newest group of brachyuran crustaceans. Spawning crabs average around in length. Since crabs spawn at the end of their life spans and perish at the end of the breeding cycle, the crabs can live up to 7 (in Germany also 8) years old. The mitten crab diet is omnivorous. Their main prey consists of worms, mussels, snails, dead organic material, and other small crustaceans and fish. =Reproduction= Starts off as a fresh-water organism. In late August the crab’s sexual instinct is awakened and they begin migrating downstream to the sea, away from their feeding grounds. It is during this migration where the crabs reach puberty and develop their sex organs. Late fall is when the crabs begin to breed in the brackish waters. The males arrive first and stay in the brackish waters all winter. The females arrive after the males arrive. The eggs are laid within 24 hours of mating. They are attached to the abdomen of the female crab. After the eggs are attached, the female leaves immediately heading to the mouth of the river. The larvae hatch from the eggs during summer and they float and drift about the brackish waters. Because the journey to breed for crabs is so great, they only breed once during their lifetimes. The breeding age is normally toward the end of their life spans. Since these crabs only breed once, they have very sizeable egg production counts. After the crabs successfully reproduce, they have very little energy and begin to waste away. Different life stages of the mitten crab: 1) Eggs require pure salt water to mature. 2) Larvae hatch from the eggs in brackish waters. 3) The larvae gradually move from brackish water to fresh water. 4) The final stage of the larvae is the megalopa, which is 3-4mm in length. 5) The megalopa then develop into small mitten crabs in the freshwater. =Invasiveness= This certain species of crab has been spread rapidly from Asia (China and Korea) to North America and Europe, raising concerns that it competes with local species, and its burrowing nature damages embankments and clogs drainage systems. The crabs can make significant inland migrations. It was reported in 1995 that residents of Greenwich saw Chinese mitten crabs coming out of the River Thames, and in 2014 one was found in the Clyde, in Scotland.Invasion warning on Scotland's rivers, BBC News, 25 September 2014 The crabs have also been known to take up residence in swimming pools. In some places the crabs have been found hundreds of miles from the sea. There is concern in areas with a substantial native crab fishery, such as the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and the Hudson River in New York (both locations where the crabs were first spotted in 2005), as the impact of the invasion by this species on the native population is unknown. It is generally illegal to import, transport, or possess live Chinese mitten crabs in the United States, as accidental release or escape risks spreading these crabs to uninfested waters. In addition, some states may have their own restrictions on possession of mitten crabs.California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 671 California allows fishing for mitten crabs with some restrictions. The Chinese mitten crab has been introduced into the Great Lakes several times but has not yet been able to establish a permanent population. The Smithsonian is tracking the spread of the Chinese mitten crab and seeking help to determine the current distribution status of the mitten crab in the Chesapeake Bay region. People are encouraged to report any mitten crab sightings, along with details (date, specific location, size) and a close-up photograph or specimen if possible. The first confirmed record along the East coast of the United States was in the Chesapeake Bay near Baltimore, Maryland, in 2005. Chinese mitten crabs have also invaded German waters, where they destroy fishing nets, hurt native fish species and damage local dams, causing damage of up to 80 million Euros. These crabs migrated from China to Europe as early as 1900 and were first documented by official German reports in 1912 from Aller River. After an investigation by German scientists in 1933, it was thought that the crabs migrated to Europe through ballast water in commercial ships. The crabs are the only freshwater crab species in Germany, and their tendency to dig holes has caused damage to industrial infrastructure and dams.3 September 2012, 中国大闸蟹入侵德国水域致德损失达8千万欧元 (Chinese mitten crabs invade German waters, cause damage of 80 million Euros), Sina News The first time the crab was brought to Europe was most likely by commercial vessels. Ships must fill their ballast water tanks and during one of these filling events, it could have been the spawning time for the mitten crab. Since the larvae are free floating and 1.7mm to 5mm in size, it would have been easy for them to be swept into the ballast water tank. Once the ship reached Europe and emptied its tank, the crab larvae were released. Over time, this repetition would allow for a prominent mitten crab population in Europe. The crab has spread and can be found in Continental Europe, Southern France, United States of America (the San Francisco Bay), and the United Kingdom. A 15-year period in Germany when the crabs were gradually entering Europe is known as the \\"establishment phase\\". Culinary Hairy crab is an important part of Shanghai cuisine The crab is an autumn delicacy in Shanghai cuisine and eastern China. It is prized for the female crab roe, which ripen in the ninth lunar month and the males in the tenth. The crab meat is believed by TCM practitioners to have a \\"cooling\\" (yin) effect on the body. Chinese spend hundreds of yuan just to taste a small crab from Yangcheng Lake, which are considered a delicacy. Most of the Yangcheng crabs are exported to Shanghai and Hong Kong, and high-profit foreign markets. Responding to the spread of the crab to the West, businessmen have started seeing it as a new source of crab for the Chinese market. One proposed scheme involves importing unwanted crabs from Europe, where they are seen as a pest, to replenish local pure-bred stock. Mitten crabs have exhibited a remarkable ability to survive in highly modified aquatic habitats, including polluted waters. Like some fish, they can also easily tolerate and uptake heavy metals, such as cadmium and mercury. Therefore, the farming and post-harvesting of the species needs proper management if it is used as a food. Concerns have been raised that the population and origin of the crab may be affected because of overfishing of the species in the Yangtze. Recently, a Chinese businessman introduced vending machines to sell this species of crab in the subways.Associated Press Video The crabs are stored at , which induces a sleep-like state.Gizmodo \\"Vending Machine Sells Live Crabs\\" Management efforts Management efforts have shown to be very difficult. This is due to its abundance, high reproductive rate, and high physiological tolerance. All the following efforts were attempted but showed little improvement: \\"catch as many as you can\\", migration barriers, trapping, raising awareness, electrical screens, and pulses. There has been a discussion of capturing the breeding crabs at the river mouths. There have been difficulties in carrying out this plan though. Other strategies such as capturing them when they pile up at dams have proven somewhat effective. The problem arises when the crabs climb the walls of the dams and over into the rivers behind the dams.

Chimes (1984, Blackwells of Oxford) p84 History The treaty served to end an English invasion of France, launched in order to stop France's support for the pretender Perkin Warbeck. The English had landed at Calais and laid siege to Boulogne. By this treaty, France agreed to expel Warbeck and live in England an indemnity of £159,000. The treaty was ratified in December. The terms of the treaty included the English accepting French control of Brittany, the French withdrawing their support for Warbeck and a war indemnity of 742,000 crowns, payable at 50,000 crowns per annum, equivalent to 5% of the crown's annual income. The treaty could be interpreted as a spectacular success, an English military incursion had forced the French to sue for peace, presenting it as 'the English are great again'. French abandonment of support for Warbeck removed one of Henry VII's key enemies. On the other hand, Henry VII had abandoned the Bretons and went back on the Treaty of Redon. However, this had already happened in 1491, and the benefits seemed to outweigh the costs. He did this whilst maintaining the Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489) with Spain so was therefore not too bothered of the loss of Brittany as a trading partner since the Medina del Campo enabled Henry VII to gain a healthy income. After 1492 a rapprochement between England and France occurred. This improvement continued until the end of Henry VII's reign.

The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by David F. Friedman for Cinépix Film Properties in Montreal. The film stars Dyanne Thorne in the titular role, who is loosely based on Ilse Koch, the wife of a real-life commandant at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Upon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with Gene Siskel calling it \\"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown\\". Particular criticism was directed at the film's graphic violence; which includes depictions of castration, flogging, human experimentation, and many other forms of torture. Word-of-mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of grindhouse and drive-in theatres. The popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film's infamy eventually evolved into a considerable cult following, with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with “strong, aggressive” female authority. The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the Nazisploitation sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the sexploitation sub-genre. Plot Europe, 1945. Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) is Kommandant of a Nazi prison camp, who conducts sadistic scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the ever-depleting German armed forces. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her victims inevitably ejaculate, and promptly has them castrated and put to death. After dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of both male and female prisoners. Though largely dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe (Gregory Knoph); a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi Aryan ideal. Wolfe, a German-American student who had been studying in Berlin before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (Tony Mumolo), one of Ilsa's former victims, that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa's bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to orgasm, becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares. Having entered into Ilsa's confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa's tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa becomes gradually more and more anxious by news of Allied forces breaking through German defenses and ever-encroaching. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa attempts to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The General is roundly impressed and awards Ilsa the Iron Cross for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent urolagnia by giving him a golden shower. With the Germans in retreat, the prisoners finally revolt, managing to kill most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her stockings by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they'll escape punishment, and summarily execute them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They're quickly outgunned by a Waffen-SS tank troupe, who promptly wipes out the small resistance. The Commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up helplessly, he coldly shoots her in the head and kills her, before ordering the razing of the camp to destroy any evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of Ilsa's death camp. Cast Analysis Ilsa is Nazisploitation film, a sub-genre of exploitation and sexploitation film that emphasizes Nazis committing sex crimes, often as camp or prison overseers during World War II. Like many of its counterparts, Ilsa follows a women-in-prison formula, but subverts it by having a female authority figure dominating male submissives. Production =Development= After Lee Frost and David F. Friedman's Love Camp 7 (1969) became successful in Canada, André Link and John Dunning of Cinepix Film Properties sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film. Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain. Dunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from Ilse Koch, wife of the commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and, later, Buchenwald. Nicknamed “The Bitch of Buchenwald”, Koch engaged in several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film's central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal. Link and Dunning approached Love Camp 7 producer David F. Friedman to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous “roughie” sexploitation films, as well as Herschell Gordon Lewis’ seminal Blood Feast. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who’d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following Wild Honey and Tender Loving Care. =Casting= Friedman’s first choice of casting for the lead role was Phyllis Davis. When she proved unviable, he sought out Dyanne Thorne to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime Las Vegas showgirl who had studied under Stella Adler, who at the time was working as a chauffeur. Thorne referred to the script as “awful”, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally. The role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa's diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator George Buck Flower, who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz's appearance is based on that of Magnus Hirschfeld, a pioneering German sexologist (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti- Nazi and anti-fascist). =Filming= The film was shot in nine days. It used the Culver City, California set of the TV series Hogan's Heroes. The series had already been cancelled and the show's producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, thus saving them the cost of having it demolished. Because the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the Canadian Film Development Corporation’s “Capital Gains Allowance”. Link and Dunning chose to both go uncredited in their capacities as executive producers. =Post-production= During editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film's opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential criticism. It reads: \\"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as 'medical experiments' in special concentration camps throughout Hitler's Third Reich. Although these crimes against humanity are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\\" =Use of pseudonyms= Several key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as “Herman Traeger”, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as “Jonah Royston”, and actors George Buck Flower as “C.D. Lafleuer” and Richard Kennedy as “Wolfgang Roehm”. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit, was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and does not hold any other credits of any kind.  Release  Ilsa was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1975 and remains unreleased in the country. It was banned in Australia, Germany, and Norway. In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and grindhouse theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time. Reception Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews. The Independent Film Journal wrote, \\"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \\"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... Ilsa plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \\"see it, because I'm certain they would then remove it.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \\"could possibly be the worst soft- core sex-and-violence film of the decade—and the funniest. It's set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader described the film as \\"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\\", which \\"wasn't notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\\". The A.V. Club gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \\"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\\". The film's director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \\"the worst piece of shit I ever read\\". Accolades Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 AVN awards, ten years after its initial release. Legacy Despite being almost-universally critically derided, the film has gained a significant cult following, in large part due to the endurance of the lead character and Thorne's camp performance. Film scholar Rikki Schubert appraises the character as feminist, writing in her book Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970–2006 “she is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.” The character is considered a quintessential pop cultural depiction of sadomasochism and hypersexuality, with Schubert writing that “The uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a ‘castrating bitch.’ She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.” Sequels Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS was followed by three sequels, all variations on the sexploitation women in prison theme: * Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks (1976) - the only sequel to be directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh’s harem. * Ilsa, the Wicked Warden (1977) - directed by Jesús Franco. Wicked Warden was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being an unrelated European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named ‘Wanda’. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Germany. * Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia (also 1977) - directed by Jean LaFleur. It is the fourth and final entry, and the only entry to be shot on-location in Canada. It is unique among the series for its “two-act” structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian gulag in the Soviet Union, while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day Montreal, where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a brothel on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by Ivan Reitman and Roger Corman under the shared alias “Julius Parnell”. Despite her character being killed off at the end of the first film, Thorne reprised her role in three follow-ups, continuing to depict Ilsa as a sadomasochistic authority figure with an exaggerated German accent. None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation. In popular culture * In Jörg Buttgereit's 1989 horror film Der Todesking, a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo (Vera, the Death-Angel of the Gestapo), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard. * The 2007 film Grindhouse features a faux-trailer for a film called Werewolf Women of the S.S. by Rob Zombie, whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character. *The New York hardcore band Murphy's Law wrote the song \\"Ilsa\\" which was inspired by the movie. *Rob Zombie also used audio clips in the track \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\" in his second solo album The Sinister Urge.

It also refers to staff having binding rights in work councils on issues in their workplace. The practice of board level representation is widespread in developed democracies.See worker-participation.eu The first laws requiring worker voting rights include the Oxford University Act 1854 and the Port of London Act 1908 in the United Kingdom, a voluntary Act on Manufacturing Companies of 1919 in Massachusetts in the United States, and the Supervisory Board Act 1922 (Aufsichtsratgesetz 1922) in Germany, which codified collective agreement from 1918.E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2016) 23(1) Columbia Journal of European Law 135 Most countries with codetermination laws have single-tier board of directors in their corporate law (such as Sweden, France or the Netherlands), while a number in central Europe (particularly Germany and Austria) have two- tier boards. Most laws apply to companies over a certain size, from Denmark at 20 employees, to Germany over 500 (for one-third representation) and 2000 (for just under one half), to France over 5000 employees. Sweden has had a law of codetermination since 1980. Overview In economies with codetermination, workers in large companies may form special bodies known as works councils. In smaller companies they may elect worker representatives who act as intermediaries in exercising the workers' rights of being informed or consulted on decisions concerning employee status and rights. They also elect or select worker representatives in managerial and supervisory organs of companies. In codetermination systems the employees are given seats on a board of directors in one-tier management systems, or seats in a supervisory board and sometimes management board in two-tier management systems. In two-tier systems the seats in supervisory boards are usually limited to one to three members. In some systems the employees can select one or two members of the supervisory boards, but a representative of shareholders is always the president and has the deciding vote. Employee representatives on management boards are not present in all economies. They are always limited to a Worker- Director, who votes only on matters concerning employees. In one-tier systems with codetermination the employees usually have only one or two representatives on a board of directors. Sometimes they are also given seats in certain committees (e.g. the audit committee). They never have representatives among the executive directors. The typical two-tier system with codetermination is the German system. The typical one-tier system with codetermination is the Swedish system. There are three main views as to why codetermination primarily exists: to reduce management-labour conflict by improving and systematizing communication channels;Prominent views of codetermination have thus been \\"social\\" in nature, concerned with expanding democratic participation in new spheres as a good in itself, reducing \\"alienation\\", and smoothing management-labour relations to prevent strong conflicts. A collection of views of this nature are found in Magazin Mitbestimmun to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation;A conservative economic approach views codetermination as not benign: a political means for transfer of wealth from shareholders to employees and to increase power of political and perhaps union actors; as evidence it is noted firms rarely adopt codetermination voluntarily: see Pejovich, Svetozar. The economics of property rights: towards a theory of comparative systems. Chapter 8. Dordrecht, NL: Kluwer Academic, 1990. and to correct market failures by means of public policy.Another economist argues that codetermination in effect corrects several market failures so lack of voluntary adoption cannot be viewed as evidence that codetermination is inefficient: see Stephen C. Smith, \\"On the economic rationale for codetermination law\\", Journal of Economic Behavior and Organisation, Vol. 16 (December 1991), pp. 261-281. The evidence on \\"efficiency\\" is mixed, with codetermination having either no effect or a positive but generally small effect on enterprise performance.For example see Felix R. Fitzroy and Kornelius Kraft, \\"Co-determination, efficiency and productivity\\", British Journal of Industrial Relations, Vol. 43, No. 2 (June 2005), pp. 233-247. Germany The first codetermination plans began at companies and through collective agreements.E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2016) 23(1) Columbia Journal of European Law 135, page 22 At the end of World War I, the Stinnes-Legien Agreement between unions and business agreed that economic power would be shared throughout the economy. In 1920 a work council law was passed, and in 1922 a law to enable representation on company boards was passed. Hitler abolished codetermination, along with free trade unions, from 1933. After the military defeat of the fascist dictatorship in World War II, codetermination was again restored from 1946 through collective agreements.E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2016) 23(1) Columbia Journal of European Law 135, page 33 In 1951, and 1952, the collective agreements were codified into new laws.This was the Mining Codetermination Act 1951 (Montanmitbestimmungsgesetz 1951) and the Work Council Act 1952 (Betriebsrätegesetz 1952). This first affected the coal and steel industries of West Germany, with an equal number of worker and shareholder (or bank) representatives, and one-third representation on other large company boards. The Codetermination Act 1976 (Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976), and the Work Constitution Act 1972 (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz 1972) are the basis for the current law. The 1976 Act requires companies with over 2,000 workers to have just under one-half representation on the supervisory board, which in turn elects the management board. Shareholders (mostly banks) and workers (who can delegate their votes to trade unions) elect members of a supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat). The chairman of the supervisory board, with a casting vote, is always a shareholder representative under German law. The supervisory board is meant to set the company's general agenda. The supervisory board then elects a management board (Vorstand), which is actually charged with the day-to-day running of the company. The management board is required to have one worker representative (Arbeitsdirektor). In effect, shareholder voices still govern the company for a number of reasons, but not least because the supervisory board's vote for the management will always be a majority of shareholders. Co-determination in Germany operates on three organisational levels: *1. Board of directors: Prior to 1976, German coal and steel producers employing more than 1,000 workers already commonly maintained a board of directors composed of 11 members: five directors came from management, five were workers' representatives, with the eleventh member being neutral. (Note: Boards could be larger as long as the proportion of representation was maintained.) In 1976, the law's scope was expanded to cover all firms employing more than 2,000 workers; with some changes concerning to the board structure, which has an equal number of management and worker representatives, with no neutral members (except in the Mining-and-steel industries where the old law remained in force). The new board's head would represent the firm's owners and had the right to cast the deciding vote in instances of stalemate. (The original law comprising coal-and-steel industries thus remained unchanged in force) *2. Management: A worker representative sits with management in the capacity of Director for Human Resources. Elected by a majority of the Board of Directors, the workers' representative sits on the Board and enjoys the full rights accorded to that position. *3. Work councils: The workers committee has two main functions: it elects representatives to the Board of Directors and serves as an advisory body to the trade union regarding plant-level working conditions, insurance, economic assistance and related issues. The committee is elected by all the workers employed in a plant. Thanks to the years during which a co-operative culture has been in place, management requests from workers for proposals to improve operations or increase productivity, for example, are no longer considered mere legal formalities; they represent recognition of the fact that workers play an important part in plant success. In tandem, a practical approach has evolved among both parties, with each aiming to reach decisions based on consensus. In addition, worker representatives no longer automatically reject every proposal for structural reform, increased efficiency or, even, layoffs; instead, they examine each suggestion from an inclusive, long-term perspective. At the core of this approach is transparency of information, such as economic data. Co- determination is thus practised at every level, from the local plant to firm headquarters. Co-determination enjoys intractable support among Germans in principle. In practice, there are many calls for amendments to the laws in various ways. One of the main achievements seems to be that workers are more involved and have more of a voice in their workplaces, which sees a return in high productivity. Furthermore, industrial relations are more harmonious with low levels of strike actions, while better pay and conditions are secured for employees. United Kingdom In the UK, the earliest examples of codetermination in management were codified into the Oxford University Act 1854 and the Cambridge University Act 1856. In private enterprise, the Port of London Act 1908 was introduced under Winston Churchill's Board of Trade.E McGaughey, 'Votes at work in Britain: shareholder monopolisation and the ‘single channel’ (2018) 47(1) Industrial Law Journal 76, page 9. Proposals for codetermination were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the Bullock Report. This was done in 1977 by Harold Wilson's Labour government. It involved a similar split on the board, but its effect would have been even more radical. Because UK company law requires no split in the boards of directors, unions would have directly elected the management of the company. Furthermore, rather than giving shareholders the slight upper hand as happened in Germany, a debated 'independent' element would be added to the board, reaching the formula 2x + y. However no action was ever taken as the UK slid into the winter of discontent and, as Labour lost the next election, two decades of Thatcherism. That tied into the European Commission's proposals for worker participation in the Fifth Company Law Directive, which was never implemented. While most enterprises do not have worker representation, UK universities have done so since the 19th century. Generally the more successful the university, the more staff representation on governing bodies: Cambridge,Cambridge University Act 1856 Oxford,Oxford University Act 1854 Edinburgh, Glasgow and other Scottish Universities,Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016 ss 10-11 have rights for staff election of councils in statute, while other universities have a wide variety of different practices. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2020, listed companies must comply or explain with one of three worker involvement options including having a worker director on board. However, companies have not yet ensured workers have the right to vote for representatives on the board. European Union In the 1970s, the European Community (now the European Union) drafted the 5th Directive on company law, proposing a two-tier board and worker representation on supervisory boards. The law would’ve been similar to Germany’s, but the proposal was not passed. The directive has not yet won widespread support to be brought into force. United States The United States has, in Massachusetts, the world's oldest codetermination law that has been continually in force since 1919, although it is only voluntary and only for manufacturing companies.E McGaughey, 'Democracy in America at Work: The History of Labor's Vote in Corporate Governance' (2019) 42 Seattle University Law Review 697 A large number of universities also enable staff to vote in the governance structure. In the 1970s, a number of large corporations including Chrysler appointed workers to their board of directors pursuant to collective agreement with the labor union. In April 2018, four Senators sponsored the Reward Work Act (S.2605) which would amend federal legislation to require all listed companies to have one-third board representation for workers. Polls showed majority support among Americans for the measure. In August 2018, Elizabeth Warren sponsored a new Accountable Capitalism Act that would require 40% of the board of directors be elected by employees in federal corporations with incomes over $1 billion. New Zealand The Companies Empowering Act 1924 allowed companies to issue shares for labour and have them represented by directors, but it was little used, even its chief promoter, Henry Valder, being unable to get his company board to agree to it. It was consolidated into the Companies Act in 1933. The Law Commission recommended its abolition in 1988 for lack of use. The Companies Act 1993 did not allow for labour shares.

It is near the village of Dorney, Buckinghamshire, and is around 3 km (2 miles) west of Windsor and Eton, close to the River Thames. The lake is privately owned and financed by Eton College, which spent £17 million developing it. Additional grants, totalling £500,000, were obtained from Sport England, UK Sport, the DCMS and SEEDA in order to build the lake's finish tower. The project was completed in 2006, after 10 years of construction.dorneylake.co.uk: \\"History & Future of Dorney Lake\\" Although it is primarily for use by the school, the facilities are hired out for rowing, as well as for canoeing, dragon boating, open water swimming and triathlon. 2012 Olympic venue The lake was used as the 2012 Summer Olympic venue for rowing and canoe sprint, and as the 2012 Summer Paralympic venue for rowing.The Olympic whitewater events took place at Lee Valley White Water Centre in Hertfordshire. For the duration of the Olympics, the lake was officially referred to as Eton Dorney; confusingly, a separate venue in Stratford was called Eton Manor due to 19th-century associations with the school. To provide for Olympic spectators, the existing facilities were enhanced to include 20,000 additional seats; most of these seats were temporary. Construction began in October 2009, following investigations by Oxford Archaeology, of enhancements to Dorney Lake, including a new cut- through between the competition lake and the return lane, a new bridge and an upgraded access road, funded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA).London2012.com: \\"Work starts on time at the London 2012 Rowing and Canoe Sprint venue\\" During the Olympic events, Dorney Lake was staffed by around 3,500 personnel including volunteers; it could accommodate up to 30,000 spectators per day.Dorney Lake and the 2012 Olympics .

Early life Hunzvi was born in Chiminya, Southern Rhodesia on 23 October 1949. He said that he joined the struggle against white minority rule in Rhodesia at the age of 16 taking the nom-de-guerre of \\"Hitler\\". He reported to have been interned in Gonakudzingwa and Wha Wha prisons between 1967 and 1970, and to have been a prominent leader in Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), though these claims have been denied by some other elders of the campaigns. He left the country and having been identified as being bright, was sent to study in Romania, becoming fluent in Romanian and French, and subsequently began medical studies in Poland where he married a Polish woman with whom he had two children. He represented ZAPU while in Poland, and in 1979, during his medical studies, Hunzvi visited London to attend the ceasefire and constitutional negotiations for the Lancaster House Agreement. Hunzvi returned to Zimbabwe in 1990, working initially at Harare Central Hospital, and later founding a medical practice in Budiriro, in the township of Harare. His wife fled Zimbabwe in 1992 to escape violence from her husband. She described Hunzvi as a \\"cruel and vile man who took delight in beating me. And as for the war, he never fired a shot. He saw no action at all.\\" He subsequently remarried and has two other children. Political career Hunzvi was subsequently elected chairman of the Zimbabwean Liberation War Veterans Association in 1997, which was, at the time, a relatively inactive organisation. A born orator, Hunzvi organised rowdy demonstrations demanding gratuities and pensions from President Robert Mugabe, and critiqued the president. The pressure tactics were successful and the 50,000 war veterans were granted one-off payments of US$2,500, as well as monthly pensions of US$100. A compensation fund was also set up to benefit those who were disabled following war service, with the amount paid determined by the degree of disability. The fund was the subject of enormous fraud, with government officials, party officials and others (including Hunzvi) determined to be 117% disabled. Experts have claimed that the settlements were a major factor in the economic crisis in the Zimbabwe. In 1999, Hunzvi was arrested in corruption case regarding the allegedly embezzlement of Z$45m of the war veterans' funds. He was denied bail, due to fear that he would intimidate witnesses or abscond. The actual trial was repeatedly postponed, and the war veterans' leadership voted to remove him from office. In 2000 Hunzvi led the campaign involving war veterans and other supporters of ZANU-PF in the seizure of white-owned land. During parliamentary elections in 1999, he incited followers to intimidate and harass members of the opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change. Calling himself \\"the biggest terrorist in Zimbabwe\\" he was identified by numerous witnesses as participation in beatings and torture, and his medical clinic labelled a \\"torture chamber\\" by Amnesty International in 2000. Hunzvi was elected to parliament in 2000, but died in 2001 in Harare's Parirenyatwa Hospital. His death was variously ascribed to malaria, a heart condition, or AIDS.

After substantial controversy, his death was the subject of an inquest 51 years after the event.  Sarin test and death  Porton Down had been testing sarin on humans since October 1951, but the first adverse reaction was not recorded until February 1953. An even more severe reaction occurred on 27 April when one of six volunteers, a man named Kelly, was exposed to 300 milligrams of sarin and fell into a coma but subsequently recovered. This prompted a reduction in the dose used in this series of experiments to 200 mg. Along with other servicemen, Maddison was offered 15 shillings and a three-day leave pass for taking part in the experiments. He had planned to use the money to purchase an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Mary Pyle. On the day he died, Ronald Maddison entered a gas chamber at 10:00 a.m. along with five other test subjects. They were each to have an identical experiment performed on them, which were part of a series of experiments to determine the lethal dose of sarin when delivered to bare or battle dress-covered skin. The method used was to measure the change in active acetylcholinesterase in red blood cells at small dose levels and extrapolate this to work out what the effect of larger doses would be. Sarin is extremely poisonous because it attacks the nervous system by blocking the activity of cholinesterase enzymes present in it, including acetylcholinesterase. The method was practical because red blood cell membranes contain forms of acetylcholinesterase. The participants were wearing respirators, with woollen hats and oversize overalls but no proper protective clothing. Two technicians were also present to carry out the experiment. The respirators were tested by exposing the men to tear gas in the chamber before the experiment started. Maddison was the fourth to have the drops applied, at 10:17 having twenty 10 mg drops of sarin applied to the two layers of cloth used in uniforms, serge and flannel, which had been taped to the inside of his left forearm. After twenty minutes, Maddison began to sweat and complain that he did not feel well. One eye witness reported at the second inquest that he slumped over the table. The contaminated cloth was removed and he left the chamber, walking (perhaps with help) about 30 metres to a bench. An ambulance was called and shortly afterwards Maddison complained of deafness, collapsed and began gasping for breath and the scientists injected him with atropine after they witnessed an asthma-like attack and convulsions. An ambulance took him to the site's local medical facility, where he arrived at 10:47. Attempts were made to resuscitate him using oxygen, further injections of atropine and anacardone, and finally an injection of adrenaline into his heart just after 11 am. Although he had died at 11 am, less than 45 minutes after being exposed to the poison, he was not formally pronounced dead until 1:30pm. Aftermath The post mortem was carried out in Salisbury Infirmary. On 8 and 16 May 1953, an inquest was held in secret before the Wiltshire Coroner, Harold Dale, who returned a verdict of misadventure. His father was permitted to attend the inquest but warned that he would be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if he informed anyone, including his family, of the circumstances surrounding his son's death. An internal court of inquiry at Porton Down found that Maddison had died because of \\"personal idiosyncrasy\\", either because he was unusually sensitive to the poison or his skin absorbed it faster than in other test subjects. The Ministry of Defence delivered Ronald Maddison's body in a steel coffin with the lid bolted down to maintain secrecy. A large number of samples of body parts including brain and spinal cord tissue, skin, muscle, stomach, lung, and gut were retained without his family's knowledge (and therefore without their permission) and used over several years in other toxicology experiments. Maddison's father, John Maddison, was paid £40 to cover the funeral expenses, made up of £20 for black clothes, £16 for undertaker's fees and £4 for catering. Second inquest  Maddison's death, along with allegations that other British chemical-weapons test participants between 1939 and 1989 were not properly informed, and may have been misled about the experiments and their risks, was the subject of a police investigation, Operation Antler, in 1999–2004. As a result of the investigation, and campaigning by Ronald Maddison's family, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, sitting with Mrs Justice Hallett in the High Court quashed the original inquest verdict in November 2002. The new inquest opened on 5 May 2004 and was the longest held in England and Wales up to that time, hearing around 100 witnesses over 50 days. On 15 November 2004, the inquest jury returned the verdict that Ronald Maddison was unlawfully killed. The Ministry of Defence applied for a judicial review to quash the unlawful killing verdict, although the government announced that whatever the outcome they would look \\"favourably\\" at paying compensation to Maddison's family. In February 2006 an agreement was struck within the framework of the judicial review whereby the MoD accepted the inquest verdict on the grounds that Maddison had died through \\"gross negligence in the planning and conduct of the experiment\\". However, the MoD did not accept that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that Maddison had not given his informed consent to take part. Following this Ronald Maddison's relatives received a total of £100,000 in compensation from the Ministry of Defence. The Crown Prosecution Service had announced in 2003 that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone responsible for the tests but that they would review this decision following the second inquest into Maddison's death. In June 2006, they confirmed that there would be no prosecutions.  References  Books * Tucker, Jonathan B. War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al-Qaeda (1st edition, 2006).

However, they held their position and did not succumb to the siege. One of their chieftains, Urwah ibn Mas'ud, was absent in Yemen during that siege. =Urwah ibn Mas'ud= After Urwah returned from Yemen and learned of the battle that had taken place at Tabuk, he hastened to Medina. Urwah had met Muhammad before as an adversary, but he accepted Islam on this meeting. When he declared his intentions of returning to his city to preach, he was warned by Muhammad that they would fight him. Urwah, however, felt too sure of his position and influence with his people. He answered: :\\"O Prophet of God, my people love me more than they do their own eyes.\\" Upon his return, he was largely avoided by his tribesmen, apparently after concluding a consultation among themselves. The following morning, Urwah gave the call to prayer from his roof. He was then surrounded and shot to death by citizens who had gathered bows and arrows. As his relatives panicked around him, it is related according to Muslim sources that his last words were: :\\"This is indeed an honor granted to me by God, the honor to die as a martyr in His cause. For my case is identical to that of all the other martyrs who gave up their lives at the gates of this city, while the Prophet of God, may God's peace and blessings be upon him, was laying siege to it.\\" He then asked to be buried together with those martyrs who were buried in that area. =Sending Chieftains= Eventually, most of the remaining chieftains went to Mecca to confront Muhammed, and became Muslims after some negotiation, resulting in the destruction of the religion of Allāt. People involved were Abd-Ya-Layl ibn Amr, Mugheera ibn Shu'ba, Khalid ibn Sa'id ibn al-Aas, Uthman ibn Abu-al-Aas and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. =Aftermath= With the dismantling of the popular cult of Allāt and the subsequent conversion of Al'Taw, the conversion of the Hijaz was complete. Muhammad's power expanded from the frontiers of Byzantium in the north to al Yaman and Hadramawt in the south. The territories of Southern Arabia were all being encouraged to join the new religion and integrate themselves into a unified system of defense. It subsequently follows that delegations from all around the region proceeded to Medina to declare allegiance to the new order and to convert to the new faith.

It is found in both Greek and Latin poetry in the classical period. Choliambic verse is sometimes called scazon, or \\"lame iambic\\", because it brings the reader down on the wrong \\"foot\\" by reversing the stresses of the last few beats. It was originally pioneered by the Greek lyric poet Hipponax, who wrote \\"lame trochaics\\" as well as \\"lame iambics\\". The basic structure is much like iambic trimeter, except that the last cretic is made heavy by the insertion of a longum instead of a breve. Also, the third anceps of the iambic trimeter line must be short in limping iambs.

It is named after James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States (1817–1825). The park unofficially demarcates the eastern point of the Fan District and is Richmond's oldest park. Description Monroe Park is pentagonal in shape, with an arrangement of paved paths among lawns and mature deciduous trees, intersecting at a cast iron fountain in the center of the area. This Victorian park is currently in the planning process of a historically sensitive, extensive renovation. The Monroe Park Advisory Council, an organization constituted by Richmond City Councilman William Pantele in 2003, in partnership with the Richmond Department of Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities and Richmond's Department of Community Development are leading the renovation initiative. =Features= Postcard showing the park and statue A bronze statue of Williams Carter Wickham designed by Edward Virginius Valentine was erected in the Park in 1891. The work was the gift of Williams' fellow soldiers and the employees of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. In 2017, Clayton and Will Wickham, two of Wickham's descendants, requested that the city of Richmond remove the statue. In their letter to the city council, the brothers wrote that \\"as a plantation owner, Confederate general and industrialist, General Wickham unapologetically accrued power and wealth through the exploitation of enslaved people\\". Public objections to the sculpture's presence in Monroe Park increased during the 2020 George Floyd protests. In June 2020, protesters toppled the sculpture using ropes. History The land on which the Park is located was purchased by the City of Richmond in 1851 at the cost of $13,592.56. Originally, the land was used as the State Agricultural Fair Grounds in the mid-19th century. During the American Civil War the area was used as a military camp and military hospital. A central stone fountain was donated by U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Albert Ordway in 1872. It was later replaced with the current cast iron fountain in the early twentieth century. Monroe Park was home to the City's first baseball games.http://www.markerhistory.com/monroe-park-marker-sa-67/ References External links * Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Richmond, Virginia Category:Parks in Richmond, Virginia Category:Virginia Commonwealth University Category:Virginia municipal and county parks ","title":"Monroe Park"},{"id":"1149413","text":":See also Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL), vCalendar. vCal is an open source calendar standard for Vision PIM.

Nesbit and first published in 1904. It is the second in a trilogy of novels that begins with Five Children and It (1902), and follows the adventures of the same five children: Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane and the Lamb. Their mother buys the children a new carpet to replace one from the nursery that they have destroyed in an accidental fire. The children find an egg in the carpet, which hatches into a talking Phoenix. The Phoenix explains that the carpet is a magic one that will grant them three wishes a day. The five children go on many adventures, which eventually wears out their magic carpet. The adventures are continued and concluded in the third book of the trilogy, The Story of the Amulet (1906).  Plot summary  This is the middle volume of a trilogy that begins with Five Children and It and concludes with The Story of the Amulet. It deviates from the other two novels insofar as it includes only a brief mention of the Psammead, a magical creature introduced in the first volume, and depicts the five children as living with both of their parents in the family home in London. In the other two volumes, circumstances have forced the children to spend protracted periods away from their home and their father. A continuing theme throughout The Phoenix and the Carpet is the element of fire. The story begins shortly before 5 November, celebrated in Britain as Guy Fawkes Night, when people build bonfires and set off fireworks. The four children have accumulated a small hoard of fireworks for the night, but they are too impatient to wait until 5 November to light them, so they set off a few samples in the nursery. This results in the fire that destroys the original carpet. To replace it their parents purchase a second-hand carpet, which is found to contain an egg that emits a phosphorescent glow. The children accidentally knock the egg into the fire, whereupon it hatches, revealing a golden talking Phoenix. It develops that this is a magic carpet that can transport the children anywhere they wish in the present time, although it is capable of satisfying only three wishes a day. Accompanied by the Phoenix, the children have exotic adventures. There is one moment of terror when the youngest, the baby known as the Lamb, crawls onto the carpet, babbles incoherently and vanishes, but it turns out that the Lamb only desires to be with his mother. At a few points in the novel, the children find themselves in predicaments from which the Phoenix is unable to rescue them by himself, so he goes to find the Psammead and has a wish granted for the children's sake. In addition, at the end the carpet is sent to ask the Psammead to grant the Phoenix's wish. These offstage incidents are the only contributions made by the Psammead to this story. A special edition published by the \\"Phoenix Assurance Company\\" of London in 1956 The Phoenix and the Carpet features depictions of London during the reign of Edward VII. At one point, the children and their supernatural bird visit the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company: the egotistical Phoenix assumes that this is a temple dedicated to him and that the insurance executives must be his acolytes. The children also have an encounter with two older ruffians, Herb and Ike, who attempt to steal the Phoenix. Four of the children (without the Lamb) attend a Christmas pantomime at a theatre in the West End of London, smuggling the Phoenix along inside Robert's coat. The Phoenix is so excited by this spectacle that he unintentionally sets fire to the theatre. All ends well when the Phoenix magically reverses the damage: no one is harmed, and the theatre remains intact. One aspect of The Phoenix and the Carpet that is unusual for children's fantasy fiction is the fact that the magical companion does not treat all the children equally. The Phoenix favours Robert, the child who put his egg in the fire, albeit by accident, over his brother Cyril and their sisters. This is a mixed privilege, as Robert is lumbered with the duty of smuggling the Phoenix past their parents at inconvenient moments. The \\"Phoenix Assurance Company\\"'s bookmark given with the special edition In the novel's final chapter, the Phoenix announces that he has reached the end of his current lifespan and must begin the cycle again, apparently on the grounds that life with the children has left him far more exhausted than he would have been in the wilderness. He lays a new egg from which he will eventually be reborn. Under the Phoenix's direction, the children prepare an altar with sweet incense, upon which the Phoenix immolates himself. The magic carpet has also reached the end of its lifespan, as it was never intended to be walked upon regularly, and, at the request of the Phoenix, it takes the egg to a place where it won't hatch again for 2,000 years. There is a happy ending, with the children receiving a parcel of gifts from an \\"unknown benefactor\\" (the Phoenix, who arranges this gift by means of a wish granted by the Psammead) and Robert receiving a single golden feather. But the feather has vanished by the evening. The last volume in the trilogy, The Story of the Amulet, contains a minor episode in which the children travel thousands of years into the past and encounter the Phoenix, who does not recognise them because the events of the previous book have not happened yet.  Chapter summary  Chapter One: \\"The Egg\\" When their old carpet is destroyed by their fireworks, the siblings get a new nursery carpet and discover a mysterious egg wrapped within it. Robert accidentally rolls the egg into the fire and out hatches the Phoenix, who tells the tale of the magic carpet. Chapter Two: \\"Topless Tower\\" The children go on their first adventure with the carpet and the Phoenix and while they discover treasure they also learn the limitations of the carpet and must get rescued by the Psammead's wish fulfilling abilities. Chapter Three: \\"The Queen Cook\\" While on an adventure to cure the Lamb of whooping cough, the children are forced by circumstances to take along their cook. Once they are on a sunny tropical island, the Cook is thought to be a queen by the natives living on the island and is content to be left behind. Chapter Four: \\"Two Bazaars\\" The children go on an adventure with the carpet to India so they can find items for their mother can sell in her Bazaar, although matters are briefly complicated when the carpet is sold as well. Chapter Five: \\"The Temple\\" After helping the children change the weather to permit an adventure, the Phoenix asks them to take him to one of his temples. At the \\"temple\\", the children and the Phoenix are honoured guests of a ceremony to celebrate the Phoenix, yet once they leave, all the gentlemen believe it to have been a dream. Chapter Six: \\"Doing Good\\" The carpet takes the children abroad to do a good deed; they meet a sad French family and return their family treasure to them (the treasure discovered in Chapter 2). Chapter Seven: \\"Mews from Persia\\" The children are meant to meet their aunt at the train station, but Robert forgot to send his mother's instructions for the aunt to meet them. The children go home alone and break into their own home. The carpet wants to visit its homeland, so the children let it go and the carpet brings back 199 Persian cats. Chapter Eight: \\"The Cats, the Cow and the Burglar\\" The carpet takes away the musk-rats it had brought as food for the cats and brings a cow instead. Jane confronts a burglar, finds him kind, and gives him the cats to sell. Chapter Nine: \\"The Burglar’s Bride\\" The children bring the burglar to the tropical island where their former cook reigns as queen. The cook and the burglar like each other, and the carpet is sent to fetch a clergyman to marry them. Chapter Ten: \\"The Hole in the Carpet\\" Despite the damaged state of the carpet, the children desire to go on one more adventure before their mother returns. Robert and Jane fall through a hole in the carpet, which continues on and takes Cyril and Anthea to their Uncle Reginald. Jane and Robert fall into a house and meet the clergyman who married the cook and burglar, but they are rescued by the Phoenix getting help from the Psammead. Chapter Eleven: \\"The Beginning of the End\\" The children go to the theatre with the Phoenix. The Phoenix flies around the theatre and starts a fire. The carpet brings the children home safely. Chapter Twelve: \\"The End of The End\\" The Phoenix and the Carpet go away, but the Phoenix sends the children all the toys they have ever wanted.  Characters  Main characters: Cyril – the oldest of the five children. He is nicknamed Squirrel. Cyril often takes on the role of leader and is sensible and level-headed. He is also the main decision-maker for the children. Although his decisions are sometimes challenged, he often has the final say in what the children do. Between the two older boys, Cyril is more considerate of morals when making decisions. Anthea – the second oldest of the children. Her nickname is Pantha or Panther. She takes on the role of a mother figure. She is rational, polite, considerate, and well-mannered. She also considers morals when helping to make decisions. Anthea is the one who has the sewing skills to fix the carpet and who demonstrates the most compassion and remorse for it. Robert – the third oldest of the five children. His nickname is Bob or Bobs. The Phoenix is most attached to him because he originally dropped the egg into the fire. Although Robert is one of the younger children, he represents an adult voice in the story – he recollects and tells the other children 'facts' that he gathered from his father over the years. He is also the one child who thinks to bring candles on their adventures after experiencing the dark tower and cave on the first carpet trip. He often takes on the role of protector of his sisters and the Phoenix. Jane – the fourth child in the family. Her nickname is Pussy. She is a stereotypical representation of a nineteenth-century 'girl' child – innocent, afraid, and in need of male protection. She is also the one who persuades the burglar to milk the cow instead of robbing the house. Lamb/Hilary – the baby and youngest of the children. His nickname is Lamb. His given name, Hilary, is revealed in the first book of the trilogy (Five Children and It). He is curious and reliant on others. He also exemplifies childhood innocence. His solo adventure on the carpet is one of the reasons why the children decide that the Phoenix and carpet must go. Phoenix – a vain and arrogant creature, although less so than the Psammead. He hides the fact that he cares for the children until they are in trouble. He is also lonely and in constant search of praise. The Phoenix becomes the primary decision- maker and rescuer for the children when they cannot agree on where to go or how to get out of a situation. He is the only one who understands the carpet. Carpet – a silent figure in the story, and yet one of the most important characters. It cannot think for itself, it is obedient and noble, and it endures the children's abuse. Although the carpet places the children in bad situations, it is also the instrument often used to extract them from those situations. Supporting characters: Father – The father is relatively absent from the story. He shows up to entertain the children but leaves other child- rearing duties to the mother. It is the father who sends the four older children to the playhouse. He is the stereotypical father figure of the nineteenth century. Mother – Mother is the angel of the house. She is most concerned with Lamb and gives the other children more freedom to do what they please. She goes out of the house often to meet with friends and takes part in social activities such as the bazaar. Cook – In the beginning of the story the cook is constantly frustrated, annoyed by the children, impatient, and unpleasant to everyone in the household. She sees the children as a menace and cause of her stress. Once she becomes Queen of the island natives she becomes calm, serene, and cheerful, and she enjoys praise. On the island she never comes to accept reality and instead thinks she is in a long dream. Burglar – The Burglar is simple-minded, kind, and somewhat inexperienced. He is swayed by Jane to milk the cow instead of rob the house. He is even convinced to take the cats that he hates. Although he goes to jail for selling the cats on the street, once he is freed by the children he marries the cook. Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop – The Reverend performs the marriage ceremony for the cook and burglar. He is indecisive, friendly, honest, and curious of things magical or unknown to him. He is also a scientist and botanist. Psammead – The Psammead is a magical figure connected to the children from the first book. It is never seen in the text by anyone but the children. This creature takes on the role of a Deus Ex Machina – it steps in throughout the story to rescue the children from the various situations they find themselves in.  Themes and issues  References to other works: Nesbit alludes to many different works of literature that were familiar to and recognised by children in the early 20th century, including King Solomon's Mines, The Count of Monte Cristo, Rudyard Kipling's tales of India,The Arabian Nights and many others. She also assumes that her readers are familiar with religious works such as the New Version of the Psalms of David and popular magazines such as The Strand, the magazine in which The Phoenix and the Carpet first appeared. Gender roles: Nesbit's Phoenix is referred to as \\"It\\", and is not described in terms of gender. The female children, Anthea and Jane, enjoy a range of activities, and do not appear to be limited by societal restrictions related to gender. Intrusion fantasy: The Phoenix and the Carpet is an intrusion fantasy that includes marvellous creatures, such as the Phoenix, magical objects, such as the flying carpet, and fantastic events, such as flying on the carpet, that intrude into the realistic world in which the protagonists live. Normally characters in intrusion fantasy are surprised by the fantastic elements that enter their world. However, the children in The Phoenix and the Carpet are not surprised because they have encountered fantastic elements in Five Children and It. Adults within the novel are in disbelief of the fantastic elements because they try to rationalise the fantastic as a dream or insanity. Social class: Nesbit wrote for the great middle-class of readers, and this novel contains some stereotypes of both the upper and lower classes. The cook, a lower-class character, does not always use correct grammar; for instance, she says \\"There's that their new carpet in their room\\" (Chapter 3). The upper class, on the other hand, have money, status, education and leisure time to pursue such activities as theatergoing. The children's mother often leaves them behind to attend the theatre. Narration: Nesbit's narrator seems to be an adult voice speaking to the child reader. The narrator comments on the story and asks the reader questions to give a fuller picture. Realistic portrayal of children: Nesbit was known for her well-drawn child characters, described in Norton's Anthology of Children's Literature as \\"believable middle-class children who experience a series of adventures in unforeseen circumstances\\" (Zipes, et al.). They are generally good-natured and well-meaning, but they also quarrel amongst each other and get into trouble. They nearly burn their nursery down by setting off fireworks, call each other names and argue over trivial matters. Still, they did not mean for their fireworks to get out of control, they look out for one another, and they have a strong sense of right and wrong. Nesbit thus gently subverts the Romantic stereotype of children as innocent little angels. Racial issues: Nesbit's work has been criticised by some critics as being racist and having anti-Semitic characterisations. In Chapter 3 of this novel the children encounter people described as having copper-toned skin, whom they immediately assume are savage cannibals.  Typography  A typographic comment: the word \\"Phoenix\\" occurs hundreds of times in the text of this novel and in several different type fonts, including roman, italic, boldface and small capitals. In early editions the word is rendered Phœnix throughout, in the style known as a ligature. However, such ligatures are rare in modern English usage, and most recent editions omit it in favour of using \\"oe\\".  Adaptations  There have been at least four film adaptations of the novel. The BBC produced three television series: one week of Jackanory in 1965, another written by John Tully that aired in 1976, and finally The Phoenix and the Carpet (1997), with a new screenplay by Helen Cresswell. A feature film was released in 1995: The Phoenix and the Magic Carpet written by Florence Fox, directed by Zoran Perisic, starring Peter Ustinov as Grandfather and the voice of Phoenix, and Dee Wallace as Mother.\\"The phoenix and the carpet\\" directory at Internet Movie Database.

As a composer, he was a late member of the Venetian School and had a role in the transformation of the instrumental canzona into the sonata. Biographical details Dario Domenico Castello was born in Venice, where he was baptised on 19 October 1602.Rodolfo Baroncini, \\"Dario Castello\\", p. 66 The title page of the 1621 edition of the first volume of the Sonate Concertate in stil moderno records him as Capo di Compagnia de Musichi d'Instrumenti da fiato in Venetia, indicating that he led a Venetian company of piffari, a band that could include sackbuts, cornetts, shawms, but also violins and viols. On 19 November 1624 he was appointed «sonador di violin» (violin player) of the St. Mark's music chapel, at the time headed by Claudio Monteverdi.Baroncini, \\"Dario Castello\\", p. 73 The title page of the second volume (1629) of the \\"Sonate concertate in Stil moderno\\" lists him as Musico Della Serenissima Signoria di Venetia in S. Marco, & Capo di Compagnia de Instrumenti, indicating that he worked at the great Basilica of St. Mark's where Claudio Monteverdi was maestro di capella. Castello's use of the stile concitato (agitated style) --with quick repeated-note figures-- is consistent with his association with Monteverdi. His brother Francesco (trombonist) and his father Giovanni Battista (violinist) also were working at St Mark's. Dario Castello died in Venice on 2 July 1631 during the great plague of 1630.Baroncini, \\"Dario Castello\\", p. 88. Style Of his music, 29 separate compositions survive. Castello's music is inventive and technically challenging. Strictly worked polyphonic sections alternate with dramatic recitatives over basso continuo, in keeping with the title of the publications \\"in stil moderno\\"; however he also uses some of the older canzona technique, which uses short sections of highly contrasting texture, and active rather than lyrical melodic lines. Unusually for the time, Castello often specifies the instruments for each part, calling for cornetti, violins, sackbuts and dulcians. That these works were still being reprinted in the 1650s attests to Castello's influence. Modern editions of the complete sonatas are published by Ut Orpheus Edizione.

History =12th century= Prior to the building of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held the title of the Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford.Pounds, p.55; Brown (1962), p.191. Hugh Bigod had been one of a group of dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region.Pounds, p.55. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165.Brown (1962), p.191. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173.Brown (1962), pp.53, 191. The Orford site was around from the sea, lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore, about away.Hartshorne, p.60. The design of the keep was unique, and has been termed \\"one of the most remarkable keeps in England\\" by historian R. Allen Brown.Brown (1962), pp.52-3. The 90-foot-high (27-metre) central tower was circular in cross- section with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the 49-foot- wide (15-metre) structure.Heslop, pp.279, 289. The tower was based on a precise set of proportions, its various dimensions following the one-to-the- root-of-two ratio found in many English churches of the period.Heslop, p. 284. Much of the interior is built with high-quality ashlar stonework, with broad, 5-foot-6-inch-wide (1.7-metre) staircases.Heslop, p.283. The best chambers were designed to catch the early morning sun, whilst the various parts of the keep were draught-proofed with doors and carefully designed windows.Heslop, pp.283-4. Originally the roof of the keep, above the upper hall, would have formed a domed effect, with a tall steeple above that.Heslop, p.293. The keep was surrounded by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle.Heslop, p.279; Suffolk HER ORF 054, Heritage Gateway, accessed 23 April 2011. The marshes nearby were drained, turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth.Brown (2004), pp.110-1. Some of the timbers were brought from as far away as Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.Brown (2004), p.111; Suffolk HER ORF 054, Heritage Gateway, accessed 23 April 2011.

The design of the keep has attracted much historical interest.Liddiard (2005), p.47. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation.Liddiard (2005), p.50. The design of the Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example.Liddiard (2005), p.49. Historians have therefore questioned to what extent the design can be seen as legitimately transitional. Instead, historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th-century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links.Heslop, p.288-9. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.Heslop, p.290. =13th to 15th centuries= Watercolour of Orford Castle in 1600, by John Norden By the start of the 13th century, royal authority over Suffolk had been firmly established, after Henry II crushed the Bigods in the revolt of 1173–1174, Orford being heavily garrisoned during the conflict, with 20 knights being based there.Brown (2004), p.136. Upon the collapse of the rebellion, Henry ordered the permanent confiscation of Framlingham Castle. The political importance of Orford Castle diminished after Henry's death in 1189, although the port of Orford grew in importance, however, handling more trade than the more famous port of Ipswich by the beginning of the century.Creighton, p.44. The castle was captured by Prince Louis of France who invaded England in 1216 at the invitation of the English barons who were disillusioned with King John. John Fitz-Robert became the governor of the royal castle under the young Henry III, followed by Hubert de Burgh.White, p.517. Under Edward I governorship of the castle was given to the de Valoines family, and it passed by marriage to Robert de Ufford, the 1st Earl of Suffolk, who was granted it in perpetuity by Edward III in 1336. No longer a royal castle, Orford was passed on through the Willoughby, Stanhope and Devereux families, whilst the surrounding economy of Orford went into decline. The estuary of the River Ore silted up and the Orford Ness spit increased, making the harbour access more difficult, resulting in a decline in trade, reducing the importance of the castle as the centre of local government. Orford Castle and surrounding earthworks The castle and surrounding lands were bought by the Seymour-Conway family in 1754. By the late 18th century only the north wall of the bailey survived and the roof and upper floors of the keep had badly decayed, and Francis Seymour- Conway, the 2nd Marquess of Hertford, proposed destroying the building in 1805.White, p.516; Orford Castle, National Monuments Record, accessed 12 May 2011. He was prevented from doing so by the government, on the grounds that the keep formed a valuable landmark for ships approaching from Holland, wishing to avoid the nearby sandbanks. Francis's son, also called Francis, undertook conservation efforts in 1831, installing a new, relatively flat, lead roof and a replacement upper floor.Hartshorne, p.61; White, p.516. Francis furnished the top of the keep for use as an apartment by guests.White, p.516. By the 1840s, however, all of the surrounding bailey wall and mural towers had almost vanished, having been quarried for stone, and the foundations could only just be seen.Hartshorne, p.61; Orford Caste, National Monuments Record, accessed 12 May 2011. =Modern period= Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928 and gave the property to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. In 1930 the castle opened to the public.James, p.100; Brindle, p.40. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep.Suffolk HER ORF 001, Heritage Gateway, accessed 23 April 2011. The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment.Orford Castle, National Monuments Record, accessed 2 June 2020. These buildings were removed at the end of the conflict. Orford Castle was given to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now maintained by English Heritage.Orford History, Orford and Gedgrave Parish Council, accessed 24 April 2011. The keep of the castle is the only part of the structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible. Some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks are not medieval but results of later quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally.The Museum, Orford Museum Trust, accessed 24 April 2011. Archaeological work to interpret the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003.Suffolk HER ORF 054, Heritage Gateway, accessed 23 April 2011. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. Wild Man of Orford Orford Castle is associated with the legend of the Wild Man of Orford. According to the chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, a naked wild man, covered in hair, was caught in the nets of local fishermen around 1167.Thompson, p.30. The man was brought back to the castle where he was held for six months, being questioned or tortured. He said nothing and behaved in a feral fashion throughout.Varner, p.78. The wild man finally escaped from the castle. Later accounts described him as a merman, and the incident appears to have encouraged the growth in \\"wild men\\" carvings on local baptismal fonts—around twenty such fonts from the later medieval period exist in coastal areas of Suffolk and Norfolk, near Orford.

During his Ministry of Defence (MoD) career he occupied a wide range of analytical and management positions in the DIS and elsewhere, including three tours in the Cabinet Office, culminating as Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). Morrison ended his official career as the senior civilian intelligence professional in the Defence Intelligence Staff, serving four years as Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence and Head of the Defence Intelligence Analysis Staff. During this period he represented the MoD and DIS as a member of the JIC, UK representative to the NATO Intelligence Board and Head of Profession for MoD Intelligence Analyst classes. He was awarded the US Defence Intelligence Agency's Director's Award in 1999. On leaving the DIS and the civil service in 1999, Morrison was selected by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) to be its first Investigator. He held this position until 2004, when his contract was prematurely terminated by the Committee after he appeared on the UK BBC television programme Panorama and maintaining that Saddam Hussein was not in fact a threat to the UK. Morrison is a joint author of The Open Side of Secrecy: Britain's Intelligence and Security Committee, the first in-depth study of the ISC.

His films include One Day in September (1999), a documentary about the 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes, the climbing documentary Touching the Void (2003), the drama The Last King of Scotland (2006), the political thriller State of Play (2009), the Bob Marley documentary Marley (2012), the post-apocalyptic drama How I Live Now (2013), the thriller Black Sea (2014), and the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney (2018). Personal life Macdonald was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His maternal grandparents were the Hungarian-born British filmmaker Emeric Pressburger and English screenwriter and actress Wendy Orme. He was brought up on a sheep farm in Gartocharn, Dunbartonshire. He was educated at Glenalmond College, and St Anne's College, Oxford. His brother Andrew is a film producer. In 1999, he married Tatiana Lund, with whom he has three sons. He lives in North London. Career Macdonald began his career with a biography of his grandfather, The Life and Death of a Screenwriter (1994), which he turned into the documentary The Making of an Englishman (1995). After making a series of biographical documentaries, Macdonald directed One Day in September (1999), about the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Possibly the most striking feature of this film was the lengthy interview with Jamal Al-Gashey, the last known survivor of the Munich terrorists (it has been suggested recently in Aaron Klein's book Striking Back that another, Mohammed Safady, might also still be alive). Macdonald found Al- Gashey through intermediaries, and was able to convince him that the film would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. Since the former terrorist was convinced that Israeli authorities were still hunting him (he had been in hiding ever since being ransomed for a hijacked aeroplane less than two months after the Munich massacre), Al-Gashey agreed to the interview only on condition that he would be disguised, his face would be shown only in shadow or blurred out, and that the interview would be conducted by a person and in a place of Al-Gashey's choosing (which turned out to be Amman, Jordan), although Al-Gashey agreed that Macdonald could be present. Since the interview was conducted entirely in Arabic (even though Al-Gashey was known to be fluent in English, having been interviewed in the language in 1972), and Al-Gashey (through paranoia or annoyance) frequently stormed out of the interview room, Macdonald did not know if he had anything usable until he returned to London and hired an Arabic translator. The film won an Oscar for Best Documentary. His next film was Touching the Void, which told the story of two climbers' disastrous attempt to scale the Siula Grande in the Andes in 1985. The film won the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film at the 2003–04 BAFTA Awards – coincidentally, it was Korda who had given Macdonald's grandfather his first job when he had arrived in Britain in 1935. Next was The Last King of Scotland, which Forest Whitaker receive widespread acclaim and won multiple acting awards including Academy Award for Best Actor. He has also directed a number of television commercials with Rogue Films who represent him for all his TV commercial work worldwide. Macdonald directed the film adaptation of hit BBC television drama State of Play, starring Russell Crowe. He then directed The Eagle, an adaptation of the book The Eagle of the Ninth, about a Roman Legion in 2nd century A.D. in Scotland. Bobby Fischer Goes to War, his next project, is a film about the 1972 World Chess Championship in Reykjavík, Iceland, in which Bobby Fischer took on the entire Soviet chess establishment. Macdonald made the film Life in a Day with producer Ridley Scott. The footage was filmed by thousands of people all around the world about their life in one day and posted on YouTube. The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival to a global live audience, on 27 January 2011. Macdonald worked with the film production team Altitude, who created the commercially and critically acclaimed Amy Winehouse documentary film Amy (2015), on a Whitney, a 2018 documentary based on Whitney Houston's life and death. This was the first Whitney Houston documentary to be officially authorized by the estate, and includes never-before-seen footage of Houston, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances and interviews with luminaries like Clive Davis. Macdonald stated, \\"The story that is never told about Whitney is just how brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung - bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists don't sell.\\" Filmography As director: * The Making of an Englishman (1995), about the filmmaker Emeric Pressburger * Chaplin's Goliath (1996), about the actor Eric Campbell * The Moving World of George Rickey (1997) * Howard Hawks: American Artist (1997) * Donald Cammell: The Ultimate Performance (1998, also producer), about the film director Donald Cammell * One Day in September (1999) (won an Academy Award) * Humphrey Jennings (2000) * A Brief History of Errol Morris (2000), interview with Errol Morris * Being Mick (2001), a fly- on-the-wall documentary following Mick Jagger * Touching the Void (2003) * The Last King of Scotland (2006) * My Enemy's Enemy (2007) * State of Play (2009) * The Eagle (2011) * Life in a Day (2011) * Marley (2012) * How I Live Now (2013) * Black Sea (2014) * 11.22.63 (2016) (episode 1, \\"The Rabbit Hole\\") * Sky Ladder - The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang (2016) * Oasis (2017) (originally intended as a TV series pilot) * Whitney (2018) * Untitled Kevin Macdonald project (TBA) Bibliography * Emeric Pressburger: The Life and Death of a Screenwriter by Kevin Macdonald.

This gene is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family and is located in the 'cluster RCA' region of chromosome 1. The gene encodes a monomeric single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein found on erythrocytes, leukocytes, glomerular podocytes, hyalocytes, and splenic follicular dendritic cells. The Knops blood group system is a system of antigens located on this protein. The protein mediates cellular binding to particles and immune complexes that have activated complement. Decreases in expression of this protein and/or mutations in its gene have been associated with gallbladder carcinomas, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with a reduction in Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, conferring protection against severe malaria. Alternate allele-specific splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. Additional allele specific isoforms, including a secreted form, have been described but have not been fully characterized. In primates, CR1 serves as the main system for processing and clearance of complement opsonized immune complexes. It has been shown that CR1 can act as a negative regulator of the complement cascade, mediate immune adherence and phagocytosis and inhibit both the classic and alternative pathways. The number of CR1 molecules decreases with aging of erythrocytes in normal individuals and is also decreased in pathological conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV infection, some haemolytic anaemias and other conditions featuring immune complexes. In mice, CR1 is an alternatively spliced variant of the complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene. Certain alleles of this gene have been statistically associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Gene region In humans, the CR1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at band 32 (1q32) and lies within a complex of immunoregulatory genes. In 5’-3’ order the genes in this region are: membrane cofactor protein – CR1 – complement receptor type 2 – decay-accelerating factor – C4-binding protein. * Membrane cofactor protein is a widely distributed C3b/C4b binding regulatory glycoprotein of the complement system; * decay-accelerating factor (DAF: CD55: Cromer antigen) protects host cells from complement-mediated damage by regulating the activation of C3 convertases on host cell surfaces; * complement receptor 2 is the C3d receptor. Factor H, another immunoregulatory protein, also maps to this location. Gene structure and isoforms The canonical Cr2/CD21 gene of subprimate mammals produces two types of complement receptor (CR1, ca. 200 kDa; CR2, ca. 145 kDa) via alternative mRNA splicing. The murine Cr2 gene contains 25 exons; a common first exon is spliced to exon 2 and to exon 9 in transcripts encoding CR1 and CR2, respectively. A transcript with an open reading frame of 4,224 nucleotides encodes the long isoform, CR1; this is predicted to be a protein of 1,408 amino acids that includes 21 short consensus repeats (SCR) of ca. 60 amino acids each, plus transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Isoform CR2 (1,032 amino acids) is encoded by a shorter transcript (3,096 coding nucleotides) that lacks exons 2–8 encoding SCR1-6. CR1 and CR2 on murine B cells form complexes with a co- accessory activation complex containing CD19, CD81, and the fragilis/Ifitm (murine equivalents of LEU13) proteins. The complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene of primates produces only the smaller isoform, CR2; primate CR1, which recapitulates many of the structural domains and presumed functions of Cr2-derived CR1 in subprimates, is encoded by a distinct CR1 gene (apparently derived from the gene Crry of subprimates). Isoforms CR1 and CR2 derived from the Cr2 gene possess the same C-terminal sequence, such that association with and activation through CD19 should be equivalent. CR1 can bind to C4b and C3b complexes, whereas CR2 (murine and human) binds to C3dg-bound complexes. CR1, a surface protein produced primarily by follicular dendritic cells, appears to be critical for generation of appropriately activated B cells of the germinal centre and for mature antibody responses to bacterial infection. The most common allelic variant of the human CR1 gene (CR1*1) is composed of 38 exons spanning 133kb encoding a protein of 2,039 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 220 kDa. Large insertions and deletions have given rise to four structurally variant genes and some alleles may extend up to 160 kb and 9 additional exons. The transcription start site has been mapped to 111 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG and there is another possible start site 29 bp further upstream. The promoter region lacks a distinct TATA box sequence. The gene is expressed principally on erythrocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and B cells but is also present on some T lymphocytes, mast cells and glomerular podocytes.  Structure  The encoded protein has a 47 amino acid signal peptide, an extracellular domain of 1930 residues, a 25 residue transmembrane domain and a 43 amino acid C terminal cytoplasmic region. The leader sequence and 5'-untranslated region are contained in one exon. The large extracellular domain of CR1, which has 25 potential N-glycosylation sites, can be divided into 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs) (also known as complement control protein repeats (CCPs) or sushi domains), each having 60 to 70 amino acids. The sequence homology between SCRs ranges between 60 and 99 percent. The transmembrane region is encoded by 2 exons and the cytoplasmic domain and the 3'-untranslated regions are coded for by two separate exons. The 30 or so SCRs are further grouped into four longer regions termed long homologous repeats (LHRs) each encoding approximately 45 kDa of protein and designated LHR-A, -B, -C, and -D. The first three have seven SCRs while LHR-D has 9 or more. Each LHR is composed of 8 exons and within an LHR, SCR 1, 5, and 7 are each encoded by a single exon, SCR 2 and 6 are each encoded by 2 exons, and a single exon codes for SCR 3 and 4. The LHR seem to have arisen as a result of unequal crossing over and the event that gave rise to LHR-B seems to have occurred within the fourth exon of either LHR-A or –C. To date the atomic structure have been solved for SCRs 15–16, 16 & 16–17. Alleles Four known human alleles encode proteins with predicted molecular weights of 190 kDa, 220 kDa, 250 kDa and 280 kDa. Multiple size variants (55–220 kDa) are also found among non-human primates and a partial amino-terminal duplication (CR1-like gene) that encodes the short (55–70 kDa) forms expressed on non human erythrocytes. These short CR1 forms, some of which are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored, are expressed on erythrocytes and the 220-kDa CR1 form is expressed on monocytes. The gene including the repeats is highly conserved in primates possibly because of the ability of the repeats to bind complement. LHR-A binds preferentially to the complement component C4b: LHR-B and LHR-C bind to C3b and also, albeit with a lower affinity, to C4b. Curiously the human CR1 gene appears to have an unusual protein conformation but the significance of this finding is not clear. The mean number of complement receptor 1 (CR1) molecules on erythrocytes in normal individuals lies within the range of 100–1000 molecules per cell. Two codominant alleles exist – one controlling high and the other low expression. Homozygotes differ by a factor of 10–20: heterozygotes typically have 500–600 copies per erythrocyte. These two alleles appear to have originated before the divergence of the European and African populations. Rosetting Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) interacts with uninfected erythrocytes. This 'stickiness', known as rosetting, is believed to be a strategy used by the parasite to remain sequestered in the microvasculature to avoid destruction in the spleen and liver. Erythrocyte rosetting causes obstruction of the blood flow in microcapillaries. There is a direct interaction between PfEMP1 and a functional site of complement receptor type 1 on uninfected erythrocytes. Role in blood groups The Knops antigen was the 25th blood group system recognized and consists of the single antigen York (Yk) a with the following allelic pairs: * Knops (Kn) a and b * McCoy (McC) a and b * Swain-Langley (Sl) 1 and 2 The antigen is known to lie within the CR1 protein repeats and was first described in 1970 in a 37-year-old Caucasian woman. Racial differences exist in the frequency of these antigens: 98.5% and 96.7% of American Caucasians and Africans respectively are positive for McC(a). 36% of a Mali population were Kn(a) and 14% of exhibited the null (or Helgeson) phenotype compared with only 1% in the American population. The frequencies of McC (b) and Sl (2) are higher in Africans compared with Europeans and while the frequency of McC (b) was similar between Africans from the United States or Mali, the Sl (b) phenotype is significantly more common in Mali – 39% and 65% respectively. In Gambia the Sl (2)/McC(b) phenotype appears to have been positively selected – presumably due to malaria. 80% of Papua New Guineans have the Helgeson phenotype and case–control studies suggest this phenotype has a protective effect against severe malaria.

As a delegate to the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, he was a signatory to the Continental Association and the United States Declaration of Independence. Morton provided the swing vote that allowed Pennsylvania to vote in favor of the United States Declaration of Independence. Morton chaired the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation. Early life Birthplace of John Morton Morton was born in Ridley Township, in Chester County, present-day Delaware County, in 1725, the exact month is unknown. His father, John Morton (Senior), was Finnish, who originated from Finland, then a part of the Realm of Sweden, with his great- grandfather, Martti Marttinen,U.S. Embassy Photo GalleryJohn Mortonin jalanjäljillä Philadelphiassa (in Finnish)YLE: John Mortonin syntyperä syynissä Raytalammilla (in Finnish) or Måns Mårtensson (name alternated for Swedish military records, later anglicized as Morton), himself a native of Juva, Finland, who had arrived in the Swedish colony of New Sweden in 1654. His mother, Mary Archer, was also of Finnish descent. Morton was the only son of his father who died in 1724 before Morton was born. When Morton was about seven years old, his mother married John Sketchley, a farmer of English ancestry, who educated Morton. About 1748, Morton married Ann Justis, the great-granddaughter of Finnish colonists to New Sweden. The couple would have eight children. Morton was an active member of the Anglican Church in Chester County. Political career Morton was elected to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1756. The following year he was also appointed justice of the peace, an office he held until 1764. He served as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. He resigned from the Assembly in 1766 to serve as sheriff of Chester County. He returned to the Assembly in 1769 and was elected Speaker in 1775. Meanwhile, his judicial career reached its pinnacle with his appointment as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1774. Morton was elected to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775. He cautiously helped move Pennsylvania towards independence, though he opposed the radical Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. When in June 1776 Congress began the debate on a resolution of independence, the Pennsylvania delegation was split, with Benjamin Franklin and James Wilson in favor of declaring independence, and John Dickinson and Robert Morris opposed. Morton was uncommitted until July 1, when he sided with Franklin and Wilson. When the final vote was taken on July 2, Dickinson and Morris abstained, allowing the Pennsylvania delegation to support the resolution of independence without dissent. Morton signed the Declaration on August 2 with most of the other delegates. Morton was chairman of the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation, although he died, probably from tuberculosis, before the Articles were ratified. Legacy St. Paul's Church Burial Ground, Chester, Pennsylvania. He was the first signer of the Declaration of Independence to die and was buried in Old St. Paul's Church Burial Ground (also known as the Old Swedish Burial Ground) in the city of Chester, Pennsylvania. Morton's grave remained unmarked until October, 1845, when the present-day 11-foot marble obelisk was erected by his descendants. The inscription on the west side of the memorial reads: The inscription of the east side of the memorial reads: The inscription on the south side of the memorial reads: The inscription on the north side of the memorial reads: In 2013 University of Turku established the John Morton Center for North American Studies, after it was concluded that the field of studies regarding North America was fragmented and a national institute was needed. Personal life Morton married Ann Justis of Chester County, Pennsylvania and together they had three sons and five daughters; Aaron, Sketchley, John, Mary, Sarah, Lydia, Ann and Elizabeth. Morton's second son, Sketchley, was a Major in the Pennsylvania Militia of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. References * Purcell, L. Edward.

At the time of the 2019 census, the population of the municipality was 19,339, with 16,907 inhabitants living in Amorebieta. The mayor is Andoni Agirrebeitia. Geography Aerial view Amorebieta-Etxano is an inland town in the comarca of Duranguesado in the province of Biscay in northern Spain. It is about east of Bilbao and close to the European route E70 which runs along the north coast of Spain. It is located in the valley of the River Ibaizabal; this river joins the River Nervión a few kilometres to the north, after which it is sometimes called the \\"Nervión-Ibaizabal\\" because the two rivers are very similar in size. Amorebieta-Etxano is situated among rugged mountains and has a rich historical heritage. History The municipality of Amorebieta-Etxano came into being on 26 January 1951 as the result of a merger between Amorebieta and Etxano, two communities in the historic administrative district of Merindad de Zornotza. The other parts of the district were merged into the neighbouring municipality of Muxika. The new coat of arms shows the union between Amorebieta and Etxano. In the 2014 census, Amorebieta had a population of 16,907 while that of Etxano was 221. The town 250px The town is divided into several districts. The church of Santa María de la Asunción is in the centre of Amorebieta on the banks of the Ibaizaba. It is a large Renaissance building started in 1555 and opened for worship in 1608 and is noted for its altarpiece. Another Renaissance church is the Parroquia de San Juan Bautista de Larrea. This dates back to 1647, and in 1704 it was given to the Carmelite Order to found a convent. In San Antonio is the hermitage of San Miguel de Dudea, and nearby is the Neoclassical López Palace.

After the Second World War, the Viking was an important airliner with British airlines, pending the development of turboprop aircraft like the Viscount. An experimental airframe was fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets and first flown in 1948 as the world's first pure jet transport aircraft. Military developments were the Vickers Valetta and the Vickers Varsity. Design and development The Ministry of Aircraft Production ordered three prototype Wellington Transport Aircraft to Air Ministry Specification 17/44 from Vickers-Armstrongs Limited. The specification was for a peacetime requirement for an interim short-medium haul passenger aircraft to serve until the more advanced designs specified by the Brabazon Committee (in particular, the Airspeed Ambassador and Armstrong Whitworth Apollo) could be developed.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 396–398.Taylor 1983, pp. 38–39. To speed development the aircraft used the wing and undercarriage design from the Wellington but the fuselage was new.Jackson 1988, p. 215. Although the original contract referred to Wellington Transport Aircraft, on completion, the name Viking was chosen. The first prototype (designated the Type 491 and registered G-AGOK) was built by the Vickers Experimental Department at its wartime Foxwarren dispersal site and was first flown by 'Mutt' Summers at Wisley Airfield on 22 June 1945.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 398. This aircraft crashed on 23 April 1946 due to a double engine failure; no fatalities occurred as a result of the crash. Following successful trials of the three prototypes the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) ordered 19 aircraft. The first BOAC aircraft flew on 23 March 1946. The prototypes were then used for trials with the Royal Air Force which led to orders for military versions (the Viking C2 (12 ordered as freighter/transports) and the modified Valetta C1). Nene Viking G-AJPH The initial 19 production aircraft (later designated the Viking 1A) carried 21 passengers, they had metal fuselages and - except for the wing inboard of the nacelles - fabric-clad geodetic wings and tail units. Following feedback from customers, the next 14 examples, known as the Viking 1, featured stressed-metal wings and tail units. The next variant, the Viking 1B, was 28 in (71 cm) longer, carrying 24 passengers with up-rated Bristol Hercules piston engines, achieved a production run of 115. One of this batch was changed during production to so that it could be fitted with two Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engines, with its first flight on 6 April 1948. On 25 July 1948, on the 39th anniversary of Blériot's crossing of the English Channel, the Type 618 Nene-Viking flew Heathrow–Paris (Villacoublay) in the morning carrying letters to Bleriot's widow and son (secretary of the FAI), who met it at the airport. The flight of took only 34 minutes. It then flew back to London in the afternoon. It obtained a maximum speed of at and averaged . In 1954 it was bought from the Ministry of Supply and underwent the substantial conversion to Hercules 634 piston engines by Eagle Aviation to join their fleet. Production finished in 1948, including 16 for the RAF of which 4 were for the King's Flight,Owen Thetford 'Aircraft of the Royal Air Force' 1988 8th Ed, p. 649. but in 1952 BEA adapted some to a 38-passenger layout, taking the maximum payload up from 5,500–7,200 lb (2,500–3,300 kg). All Vikings featured a tailwheel undercarriage. The 58th Viking (c/n 158) became the prototype of the military Valetta, of which 262 were produced for the RAF. When production of this strengthened but externally similar type ended in 1952, a flying classroom version with tricycle undercarriage was already being delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF), called the Varsity.Green and Pollinger 1955, p. 184. All but one of those entered RAF service, the other example going to the Swedish Air Force. The production of 161 Varsities kept the Hurn works busy until January 1954, and they enjoyed a long service life. Examples are preserved at Brooklands Museum, the Imperial War Museum Duxford and the Newark Air Museum. Operational history BEA Vickers Viking 1B G-AHPO \\"Venturer\\" at Manchester Airport in 1952 The first Viking was flown from Vickers' flight test airfield at Wisley, Surrey, by chief test pilot Joseph \\"Mutt\\" Summers on 22 June 1945 and the third aircraft built was delivered to BOAC at Hurn near Bournemouth on 20 April 1946. Upon the delivery of nine examples to BOAC for development flying, including the two remaining prototypes, British European Airways (BEA) was established on 1 August 1946 to operate airliners within Europe and these first VC.1 Vikings were transferred to the new airline.Taylor 1983, p. 39. After a trial flight from Northolt to Oslo on 20 August 1946 by the newly formed BEA, the first regular Viking scheduled service commenced between Northolt and Copenhagen Airport on 1 September 1946.Chorlton Aeroplane Monthly Winter 2013, p. 81. In all 163 Vikings were built. The initials \\"VC\\" stood for Vickers Commercial,Flight 24 May 1945 echoing the \\"VC\\" precedent set by the earlier Vimy Commercial of 1919. Vickers soon ceased to use the 'VC' letters, instead using type numbers in the 49x and 600 series, which indicated the specific customer airline. Viking 1B of the Arab Legion Air Force (Jordan) at Blackbushe Airport, Hants, in April 1955 BEA operated their large fleet of Vikings on many European and UK trunk routes for eight years. From 1951, the remaining fleet was modified with 36, instead of 27 seats, and named the \\"Admiral Class\\". BEA operated the Viking until late 1954, when the last was displaced by the more modern and pressurised Airspeed Ambassador and Vickers Viscount. BEA sold their Vikings to several UK independent airlines for use on their growing scheduled and charter route networks. Some were sold to other European operators. An ex-BEA Viking 1B was fitted out as a VIP aircraft for the Arab Legion Air Force, mainly for the use of the King of Jordan.Martin 1975, p. 26. Most Vikings had been retired from service by the mid-1960s and the sole surviving example in the UK is owned by Brooklands Museum where it is under long term restoration.

Before that, he was elected to the Florida Territorial Council and as a delegate to the U.S. Congress from Florida. In the mid-1830s, he developed two plantations in Leon County, Florida, one of several thousand acres. In 1860 he held more than 120 slaves and was the third-largest slaveholder in the county.Thomas Blake, \\"Largest Slaveholders from 1863 Slave Census Schedules\\", Free pages, Rootsweb Early life and education Richard Call was born to William and Helen Meade Walker Call and was the nephew of another Richard Call, a Revolutionary War hero.\\"Call and Brevard Family Papers\\" , Florida Memory, State Library and Archives of Florida Call was born in Pittsfield, Prince George County, Virginia. Shortly after 1800, his widowed mother brought her children and six slaves across the Appalachian Mountains into Kentucky. She eventually settled on land owned by her brother Senator David Walker in Russellville, Kentucky, where Call spent most of his remaining childhood. Following the death of his mother in 1810, Call settled near another uncle in Tennessee in order to receive a formal education. In 1813 he left college to take part in the Creek War, which occurred during the period of the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Call was the uncle of Wilkinson Call, who much later became a U.S. Senator. War and politics Richard Call came favorably to the attention of General Andrew Jackson, a leader during the war. In 1814, Call was commissioned as a first lieutenant and went to Florida to serve as Jackson's personal aide. He returned with General Jackson in 1821 to establish the territorial government after the United States acquired Florida from Spain by the Adams-Onís Treaty. After resigning from the Army in 1822, Call decided to make Florida his home and opened a legal practice. Call was a delegate to the 1856 Know Nothing convention in Philadelphia, but walked out over the North vs. South split over slavery (demanding that Section 12 in support of the Kansas-Nebraska act be restored). Marriage and family In 1824 Call married Mary Letitia Kirkman of Nashville. Her parents were enemies of Jackson and opposed the marriage. The young couple was married at General Jackson's home, the Hermitage. Of their several children born, two daughters: Ellen Call Long and Mary Call Brevard, survived to adulthood. Florida Call made the rest of his life in Florida. He was appointed as receiver in the land office, giving him insight into developing areas. He was elected to the Legislative Council of the territory and served as a Delegate to the U.S. Congress. In the 1830s, he bought and developed two plantations in Leon County. One had nearly 9,000 acres and the other, The Grove Plantation, was a square mile in northern Tallahassee. On March 16, 1836, he was appointed by President Andrew Jackson as the governor of the territory. During his first term, as brigadier general of the territorial militia, he led forces in fighting the Seminole Indians, winning victories at the second and third Battles of Wahoo Swamp in the Seminole War. President Martin Van Buren replaced him as governor with Robert R. Reid on December 2, 1839 following a dispute with Federal authorities over their assistance during the war. In the 1840 presidential campaign, Call crossed party lines to assist Whig William Henry Harrison, who won and appointed him again as governor of Florida. During this second term, which began on March 19, 1841, Call moved the territory closer to statehood. He worked to minimize the financial problems that Florida suffered due to bank failures and a national business depression. He left office on August 11, 1844. In 1845, Florida became a state and Call sought election as governor. His role in supporting the election of President Harrison caused him to lose. Planter and slaveholder During the 1830s, he had developed two plantations on land that he purchased in Leon County. Orchard Pond Plantation had more than 8,000 acres and was located north of Tallahassee. The Grove Plantation was located on Tallahassee's northern outskirts, where the Governor's Mansion was later constructed. By 1860, Call had more than 100 slaves at Orchard Pond Plantation and was the third-largest slaveholder in the county. He died at The Grove on September 14, 1862. The Grove Plantation was purchased in 1942 by future Florida governor LeRoy Collins, and his wife Mary Call Darby Collins, a great-granddaughter of Richard Call. Collins later was elected for two terms as governor. Today the Call-Collins Mansion at the Grove is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Collinses sold the house and property to the state for use as a historic house museum. Legacy Several streets in Florida are named after Richard K. Call. Call Streets are in Tallahassee, Starke, Jacksonville, Hollywood, and High Springs. The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor. References *Morris, Allen and Joan Perry Morris, compilers.

The town is the seat of the Manawatu District Council. Feilding has won the annual New Zealand's Most Beautiful Town award 16 times. It is an Edwardian-themed town. The town is currently extending its CBD beautification featuring paving and planter boxes on the footpaths on the main streets in the CBD, including the realignment and beautification of Fergusson Street to the South Street entrance of Manfeild Park. The town is a service town for the surrounding farming district. The Feilding Saleyards have been a vital part of the wider Manawatu community for over 125 years. As transport systems improved and farming practices changed, the need for small, local saleyards all but disappeared, leaving few major selling complexes in New Zealand. Manawatu is a diverse and fertile farming area with high production, high stock-carrying capacity and a stable climate. These factors make Feilding Saleyards a popular medium for many farmers. A unique aspect of Feilding Saleyards is their location in the centre of town.\\"Feilding Saleyards 125 Years of Success 1880–2005\\" (June 2005) Adapted by Foreword authored by Ian McKelvie. The Manawatu Plains, on which the town is sited, are very fertile land, and as such it is a prosperous agricultural area. Being located on the floodplain of a major river has its problems, however, and in February 2004 the town suffered extensive flooding. In 2009 the Horizons Regional Council commissioned a new flood protection scheme to prevent extensive flooding in the future. Feilding Hotel Feilding Clocktower A reminder to keep Feilding's tidy and attractive image History =European settlement= The town was named after Colonel William H. A. Feilding, a director of the Emigrants and Colonists Aid Corporation Ltd. who negotiated the purchase of a 100,000 acre (400 km²) block of land from the Wellington provincial government in 1871. The first European settlers arrived from Great Britain on 22 January 1874. The Feilding Edwardian Project Inc. was established in September 1993 by local businesses with the aim of revitalising the central business area of Feilding. Many of the commercial buildings were built in the 1900s (Edwardian era) and have been restored and preserved over time. Feilding is home to a number of historic collections, buildings, monuments and museums, including THE Coach House Museum, St Johns Church, Feilding Club, Feilding Hotel, AND Feilding & Districts Steam Rail Society. =Military presence= In recent years there has been a steady increase in military families from the Royal New Zealand Air Force buying property and living in Feilding, mainly due to the close proximity of RNZAF Base Ohakea. In 2017 it was announced that the Republic of Singapore Air Force was looking to establish a permanent F-15 fighter jet training base at Ohakea, but this was scrapped in December 2018 due to \\"excessive costs involved\\". =Marae= Feilding has two marae, connected to the Iwi of Ngāti Kauwhata: Aorangi Marae and its Maniaihu meeting house; and Kauwhata Marae or Kai Iwi Pā and its Kauwhata meeting house. In October 2020, the Government committed $1,248,067 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kauwhata Marae and 5 others, creating 69 jobs.  Demographics  The Feilding urban area had a usual resident population of 15,990 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,521 people (10.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,352 people (17.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 7,704 males and 8,286 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female. Of the total population, 3,252 people (20.3%) were aged up to 15 years, 2,817 (17.6%) were 15 to 29, 6,570 (41.1%) were 30 to 64, and 3,354 (21.0%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 87.0% European/Pākehā, 19.5% Māori, 2.5% Pacific peoples, 3.2% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). Economy Employing about 30 people with a payroll of $1.5m in 2015, Proliant, an Iowa based firm privately held by the father and son team of Wally and Nix Lauridsen, constructed a $24m factory on the outskirts of Feilding for the production of a byproduct from cattle blood plasma, bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is used in pharmaceuticals, vaccines and medical research.

It stands on the densely forested ', sometimes also called the Teutberg or Teut, a hill (elevation 386 m) in the Teutoburger Wald (Teutoburg Forest) range. The monument is located inside the remains of a circular rampart. The monument was constructed between 1838 and 1875 to commemorate the Cherusci war chief Arminius (in German, Hermann) and his victory over Rome at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. When the statue was built, its location was believed to be near the original battle site, although experts now consider it more likely that the battle took place near Kalkriese, about 100 km to the north-west. Background In 9 AD, Roman-educated Arminius, a member of the Cherusci people, turned against his former Roman allies and led an alliance of Germanic tribes to defeat three legions under Publius Quinctilius Varus. The legions were completely destroyed, and the remains of some 20,000 Roman troops, along with Varus, were left to decay in the forest. To Rome and its Emperor Augustus the loss was a catastrophe; it is often called the \\"Varian disaster.\\" This event later came to be seen as a vital turning point in Middle-European history as it may have been instrumental in limiting the advance of the Roman Empire into Germania. In the 16th century, Arminius was (mis-)translated into German as Hermann in the writing of Ulrich von Hutten (1529) and this name became established. Germany was among those countries where nationalism became a rising force in the 18th century as opposition to aristocratic rule increased. Equating the nation with all of its people rather than just with its rulers was a revolutionary idea at the time. In Germany, it became entwined with the hopes of many for an end to the disunity that had ruled the Holy Roman Empire at least since the Peace of Westphalia. Nationalists wanted one of the German princes to unite all of Germany under a single rule. In this regard, Arminius came to be seen as a symbol, since he allegedly had \\"united\\" the Germanic tribes. Reports by Roman historians on internecine fighting among the tribes were deliberately ignored. Arminius (or \\"Hermann\\") thus became a subject of popular literature such as Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock's three dramas on this topic (1769, 1784 and 1789). However, Heinrich von Kleist likely did most to popularise Arminius in Germany with his Hermannsschlacht (1808). At that point, the old Empire had been dissolved, the Kingdom of Prussia had been defeated and partially dismembered by Napoleon and all hopes of a German Great Power emerging in the foreseeable future seemed lost. In this situation, Arminius served as an historical role model (\\"Father of the German Nation\\") for those willing to continue the fight against the Empire of France, which was seen as the latest successor of the Roman Empire as an external enemy (via the Medieval Popes and the early modern Kingdom of France). The Congress of Vienna, which re-ordered Europe after Napoleon's final defeat, disappointed hopes for a unified Germany as the princes were mostly able to retain their independent powers in the new Deutscher Bund. History of the monument The Hermannsdenkmal circa 1900 The statue up close. The sword has a length of 7 meters and weighs ca. 550 kg Hermann monument in Detmold, North Rhine-Westphalia =Construction= Hermannsdenkmal in 2016 Hermannsdenkmal in 2016 from the back Against this backdrop Ernst von Bandel came to the Teutoburg Forest in 1836 to put into action his life's dream of erecting a monument to Arminius. He considered building it near the Externsteine, but eventually settled on the Grotenburg, locally also sometimes referred to as Teutburg or Teutoburg. In 1837, an association called Verein für das Hermannsdenkmal was established at Detmold with the goal of funding the project, so Bandel could focus on the work of designing rather than on fundraising. Similar organisations were founded in other parts of Germany and donations started to come in. That same year, Prince Leopold II gave his permission to build the monument, but only for the Grotenburg location, thereby settling the issue. He also provided the property rights for the project. The local residents agreed to forfeit their wood pasture rights on the peak. Bandel's family moved to Detmold. In 1838, Bandel changed his original draft idea for the figure of 1834 to take into account that a pedestal would be needed in this location, to make the statue visible from afar. Earthworks began in July 1838, and the foundation stone was laid in October 1838. Bandel then traveled to Italy and met King Ludwig I of Bavaria en route, who promised him financial support but also asked for a design change. Thus the rock that was supposed to cap the temple and serve as the base for the figure was to be replaced by a dome surrounded by a gallery. Bandel included this in his final draft of 1840. Problems emerged as Bandel's designs were subject to criticism and the financial viability of the project came to be questioned. Thus, in 1839, Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Christian Daniel Rauch presented an alternative design. The Prussian king preferred Bandel's more martial design. Yet despite an ample flow of donations, financial difficulties continued. An initial celebration on occasion of the finished base vault on 8 September 1841 already gave rise to some fervent anti-French rhetoric. In 1844, the pedestal was completed, but it had overshot cost estimates by 4,000 thaler. This caused a rift between the Verein and Bandel, who moved back to Hanover in 1846. After the German revolution of 1848 failed to create a unified German state, the flow of donations for the monument became a trickle and work ceased. Bandel now used his private wealth to continue the work. By 1860, the design for the statue's internal iron frame had been created. A supportive Verein was founded in Hanover. From 1862, Bandel worked on the copper plates at a workshop in Hanover. In 1866, Prussia defeated Austria and German nationalism once again was on the rise. It became more associated with authoritarianism than with the liberal ideas of 1848 and also more anti-French. That year, Prussia annexed the Kingdom of Hanover and its king once again took an interest in the project. In 1869, William I of Prussia visited Bandel's workshop. After the German victory over the French in the Franco-Prussian War and the creation of the new German Empire, Bandel's Arminius monument perfectly captured the mood of the times and work advanced rapidly. The new Reichstag allocated 10,000 thaler. From August 1871, Bandel once again worked on the site and in 1872 moved there with his wife. In September 1873, the workshop in Hanover was closed and the finishing touch to the monument (the attaching of the Emperor William relief) was applied in July 1875. The monument was inaugurated on 16 August 1875, in the presence of Emperor William I and the crown prince, Frederick, which made this an event of national importance. Around 20,000 to 30,000 people participated in the festivities. Although it was \\"given\\" to the German people in that ceremony, the Verein remained the legal owner of the monument. The Verein was dissolved in 1881 and transferred responsibility for it to the government of the Principality of Lippe. After a long legal process, ownership passed to the foundation Hermannsdenkmal-Stiftung in 1928, which remains the caretaker today. After 1945, the foundation was linked closely to the '. =Later reception= From its inauguration, the monument served as a memorial for the war against and victory over France. At the same time, Prussia and Germany were in the middle of Kulturkampf, a fight against the power of the Roman Catholic Church, thus Arminius became a convenient symbol of \\"another victory over Rome\\". In the Empire, the Hermannsdenkmal was indeed treated as a national monument, but it remained controversial. At first it was Catholics, but later social democrats, unionists and communists who failed to identify with the monument. Until 1909 no large-scale events took place there, but the location was used for numerous private occasions in memory of the 1870/71 war. In 1881, Detmold was connected to the railway and tourists started to arrive, initially numbering just a few hundred per year, but by 1895 there were 20,500 visitors. In 1909, the 1900th anniversary of Arminius' battle was celebrated with a multi-day event (14 to 23 August), involving parades, costumes and re- enactments of the battle. Around 30,000 people attended the celebration on 15 August at the Grotenburg. Historian Hans Delbrück gave the keynote speech and the newly built Bandel Bench (financed by individual donations) was inaugurated. Missing from the scene was the Kaiser, however. Due to a past argument over the succession in the Principality of Lippe, the current Prince, Leopold IV had asked for the Emperor to be omitted from the list of guests. The day ended with an outdoor staging of a new play by August Weweler, Hermann der Cherusker. This started an annual tradition of such theatrical events, known as the Hünenring-Festspiele after the setting, the Kleiner Hünenring. It was to last until the end of the Empire in 1918. During World War I the monument became an instrument of military propaganda, which implied that the current war would end with a German victory like the battle fought by Arminius or the war of 1870/71. In 1915, the number of annual visitors exceeded 50,000 for the first time. In the Weimar Republic the monument became a popular meeting point for associations and societies of the nationalist, monarchist and reactionary right whilst the government kept its distance. The 50th anniversary of the statue's inauguration from 1 to 19 August 1925 thus was an event dominated by the political right. On 8/9 August, around 50,000 visitors attended a procession. Another highlight was a long-distance relay race called Hermannslauf beginning at 16 different points all over Germany (such as Kulm, the Zugspitze or Flensburg) and in which 120,000 runners participated. The final runners arrived at the Grotenburg on 16 August. The keynote speech of the celebration on 9 August was given by the head of the right-wing Der Stahlhelm, and other nationalist groups such as the Jungdeutscher Orden were also prominent. Tourism flourished in the Weimar years: 1920 96,000 people climbed the monument, by 1925 that number had increased to 120,000. Adolf Hitler visited the monument in 1926 and after 1930 the Lippe NSDAP used the location for a number of assemblies. After the Machtergreifung of 1933, the Detmold government tried to have the Hermannsdenkmal declared the official Wallfahrtstätte der deutschen Nation (pilgrimage site of the German nation) but was turned down by the Nazi government in Berlin. The Nazi leadership preferred to organise events at locations of its own choosing, with better transport facilities. The monument featured as a symbol in Nazi propaganda material, but as a place for assemblies it was mostly used only by the Hitlerjugend and local branches of the various Nazi organisations. In 1936, the monument had 191,000 visitors. Events in 1935 (the monument's 60th anniversary) and 1941 (100 years since the foundation stone was laid) were smaller than the 1909 and 1925 celebrations and focused on glorifying Hitler and glamorizing him as the successor of Arminius. Post-1945, attempts were made to de-politicise the monument. The 75th anniversary celebrations in 1950 were relatively low key, even though they lasted longer than any previous ones, from 6 July to 20 August. They mostly served to promote the region as a tourist destination. Annual visitor number rose to 400,000 in the 1960s and 1970s, but the focus shifted towards the view and the monument as a purely touristic sight, while the political connotations were pushed into the background. Events in 1975 and 2000 (100th and 125th anniversary) for the first time included critical debate of the 19th-century views of Arminius and the role of the monument in shaping the public's reception of the Germanic past. Description =Location= The monument stands on the peak of the wooded hill known as Grotenburg, 386 m above NHN. The hill is part of the Teutoburg Forest. It is located south of the Stadtteil of Detmold. To the southwest lies the Sennelager Training Area. =Overall dimensions and materials= The monument rises a total of 53.44 m. The statue accounts for 24.82 m (including the sword). Pedestal and base of the statue make up the difference. The statue was made from around 200 copper plates riveted together and supported by an iron frame. The copper weighs an estimated 11.8 metric tons. The pedestal is made of local sandstone, quarried on the hill nearby. =Statue= The statue faces west. This reflects the idea that Varus' troops were coming from this direction. It is also intended to confront France, considered to be the Erbfeind (sworn enemy) of Germany in the 19th century. The subject wears clothes deemed historically accurate at the time and has a body shape which the designer considered to be \\"typically Germanic\\". The right arm holds the sword pointing upward. The left is supported by a large shield. The statue's left foot rests on a Roman Eagle, the standard of the Roman Legions. Next to it lies a fasces, the symbol of Roman judicial authority. The figure's position is known as contrapposto, with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. Arminius is shown wearing trousers, a short skirt reaching to the upper thighs, a tabard held closed by a fibula and boots. On the bearded head with short curly hair sits a winged helm. Bandel knew that Germanic tribes did not use winged helmets but wanted to show the eagle as a heraldic symbol of Germany. The sword has the following inscription in gold letters: :DEUTSCHE : EINIGKEIT : MEINE : STAERKE MEINE : STAERKE : DEUTSCHLANDS : MACHT :German unity (is) my strength – my strength (is) Germany's might. On the shield is written Treufest (roughly \\"always faithful\\"). =Pedestal= The pedestal is shaped like a monopteros, a Classical round temple. This is surrounded by ten columns, supporting Gothic arches. At the time of construction, the Gothic style (which actually originated in France) was deemed a \\"true German\\" style. Inside the pedestal is a spiral staircase of 75 steps leading up to a round platform encircling the dome on which stands the statue. Three of the niches created by the columns contain inscriptions: The first shows a Latin quotation from Tacitus' Annals, describing Arminius as the liberator of Germany (Germaniae). The second refers to the Befreiungskriege against Napoleon. It blames the prior defeats in the Napoleonic Wars on the help France received from some German states and celebrates Prussia as the leader and liberator of Germany. It also gives the dates of the Battle of Leipzig, the Treaty of Paris, the Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Issy (i.e. the fall of Paris in 1815). The third niche contains a relief of Emperor William I, celebrating his victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 and his role as unifier of Germany as the first Emperor of the German Empire. He is explicitly equated with Arminius in the inscription. Underneath, an inscription states that Napoleon III declared war on Prussia in July 1870, which resulted in \\"utter defeat\\" for France at the hand of the combined German states and the establishment of the Unification of Germany. =Stairway and Bandel Bench= These structures were added in 1908/09, based on an overall design by architect Wilhelm Kreis. The stairs lead up from a small landing to the statue from the front. The landing ends at the Bandel Bench, a semi-circular stone bench decorated with carvings of trophies taken from the Romans by the victorius Germans (designed by sculptor Wilhelm Albermann). In its centre sits a copper monument commemorating Bandel, designed by . Other nearby structures Near the monument stands the Bandelhütte, the historic hut where Bandel lived during the final years of construction (1872–75). Today, it features a small exhibition on the monument. A bit further away is the Bismarckstein monument, dedicated to Otto von Bismarck in 1895. Grotenburg The hill also features two circular ramparts. One, around 300 m from the monument, is known as the Kleiner Hünenring. The other, larger one, surrounds the monument and is known as Grotenburg or Großer Hünenring. The latter had a total size of around 11 hectares. It likely was one of a number of similar structures built and used from the 3rd to 1st century BC by local tribes at the northern edges of the German Mittelgebirge, apparently inspired by Celtic hilltop settlements further south. The Grotenburg walls probably were of a type made up of earth and supported by timber, but not much is known about their construction. Almost nothing of the structure remains visible today, as the terrain has been altered by the building of the monument, the parking area and other touristic infrastructure. No archaeological findings have been made, with the exception of a possible Iron Age (Roman) spear head. Hermann Monument in New Ulm A similar Hermann Monument was built in the 1890s in New Ulm, Minnesota, a town settled by German immigrants. Today Detailed view of the statue: recognizable are the riveted copper-plates. The statue is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Germany with over 530,000 visitors a year.

He was a leading expert on machine guns; he was killed in action during the Battle of Belleau Wood. Biography Cole was born in on September 23, 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts to Charles and Mary Lyon (Ball) Cole. He graduated from Harvard University in 1902, where he was a member of the Owl Club.Malcolm, The Hingham Journal, 2001. Cole was one of the United States' leading experts on machine guns and had published several articles and a book on the subject -- Field Book for Machine Gunners (1917). He received a direct commission in the Marine Corps in World War I. Cole received the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during the Battle of Belleau Wood in which he was mortally wounded on June 10, 1918. On that day, while he was leading an attack on enemy machine guns a German hand grenade wounded him in the foot. When a second grenade landed in front of him, he grabbed it to throw it back and protect his men -- it exploded in his hand. He crawled back to his men under rifle fire. He died from his wounds on June 18, 1918, in a field hospital near Coulommiers, France, with his brother, U.S. Army Brigadier General Charles H. Cole at his side. He is buried in the Aisne-Marne Cemetery, Belleau, France. His decorations included the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross; as well as the French Légion d'Honneur and the Croix de Guerre. Citations For his actions on June 10, 1918 during the Battle of Belleau Wood, Cole received both the Navy Cross and the Army Distinguished Service Cross. Cole's Navy Cross citation reads: :In the Bois de Belleau, France, on June 10, 1918, his unusual heroism in leading his company under heavy fire enabled it to fight with exceptional effectiveness. He personally worked fearlessly until he was mortally wounded. His Distinguished Service Cross citation reads: :In the Bois de Belleau, on June 10th 1918, displayed extraordinary heroism in organizing positions, rallying his men and disposing of his guns, continuing to expose himself fearlessly until he fell.

DTMB is a field activity of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. History In 1896, David Watson Taylor designed and supervised construction of the Washington Navy Yard's Experimental Model Basin which was at that time the best facility in the world. That facility was a significant design testing capability before, during, and after World War I. Inadequacies in that facility led the navy to look for a new model capability. The new navy modeling facility - named for David Taylor - was built in 1939 in today's community of Carderock just west of Bethesda, Maryland in Montgomery County. The Carderock facility contains multiple test basins designed for a variety of testing capabilities. DTMB has strongly influenced naval architecture for 70 years. Technical capabilities Three adjoining sections comprise the Shallow Water Basin: deep water, shallow water, and a -shaped turning basin used for steering maneuvers. Its carriage can provide speeds up to 18 knots. The Deep Water Basin has a pneumatic wavemaker located at one end, and a wave absorbing beach at the other. This capability allows modeling of regular or irregular sea states. Located behind a movable section of the beach is a fitting out dry dock. Its carriage can provide speeds up to 20 knots. The High-Speed Basin comprises two adjoining sections: a deep water section and a shallow water section. Wavemaking capability exists in this basin, and there are three large underwater viewing windows at different elevations which are set into the wall about mid-length. The high-speed carriages can provide complex motions for the model at speeds up to 50 knots. Computing The David Taylor Model Basin was an early adopter of computers, and an active site for computer technology. Represented by Betty Holberton, it was one of three government agencies present at the 1959 meeting where the computer language COBOL was created. It also had one of the two UNIVAC LARCs that were built.

Shoehorns have the same basic shape but the length or strength of the handle varies. Long-handled shoe horns are necessary for longer boots, while shoe horns with sturdy handles are useful for putting on boots or heavy iron shoes. They are sometimes used by people who, because of less flexible joints, wish to reduce straining or bending. Originally, shoehorns were made from animal horns,Evans, 282 hooves, or glass; luxury shoehorns were made of ivory, shell, silver, or bone. Although shoehorns made of bulls’ hooves are still available, metal, plastic, and wood are most often used. History Shoehorns appear to have originated in the late Middle Ages or Renaissance; in English a \\"schoying horne\\" is mentioned in the 15th century, though the French word chausse-pied is only found during the last half of the 16th century.Costume historian; Evans, 282 Elizabeth I of England bought 18 shoe horns from her shoemaker Garrett Johnson between 1563 and 1566, then in 1567 ordered four more in steel from the blacksmiths Gilbert Polson and Richard Jeffrey, and then needed no more until 1586. Presumably these were used by many people in her household.Victoria and Albert Museum; Costume Historian A group of more than 20 known English shoe horns are all signed and dated,Catalogue; Evans has only seven or so - her wording is not wholly clear as to whether the five in the Drane collection and those in the Evans collection overlap. See also the list of names near the end. to between 1593 and 1613,1612 per Evans, 282; 1613 per Robinson; the Victoria and Albert Museum says 1623, a typographic error confirmed in private correspondence with the MoL dated 4 June 2015. and made by Robert Mindum. All also are inscribed with the names of their owners; These include both men and women, including \\"JANE HIS WIFE\\" in 1612.Catalogue, 1612 The inscription on one is typical: \\"THIS IS AMBRES BVCKELLS SHOING HORNE MADE BY ROBART MINDVM ANNO DOMINI 1598\\". There is also other engraved decoration on all, including heraldic medallions, geometric designs and flowers, covering most of the surfaces, in a style characteristic of later scrimshaw. Their shape is very similar to modern examples, and the longest is 11 inches long; five are turned back at the narrow end in a kind of hook. Several have holes pierced in them, presumably for a cord or leather thong used for pulling them out of the shoe or hanging them up. One owner (\\"Hamlet Radesdale\\", 1593) is described as a citizen of London who is a cooper; none of the owners seem to be recorded otherwise. Joan Evans suggested, given the nature of the inscriptions, that Robert Mindum made them as a hobby and gave them to his friends. A powder horn similarly inscribed and decorated by him also survives.Evans, 282-283 The British Museum also has a similar inscribed and decorated horn by another maker.British Museum; the example Evans (p. 282) thought was in the British Museum but \\"inaccessible\\" does not seem to appear in the current online database of their collections.Robinson suggests Evans may be referring to the 18th century shoehorn by Thomas Genn. British Museum accession number, 1889,0930.5  Turn of phrase  \\"Shoehorning\\" has come to mean, mostly in American English, the act of coercing or pressuring an individual into a situation which does not leave enough room, either literally or figuratively. Shoehorning in a conversational context means to force someone to take one of a limited number of positions, neither of which may adequately express what the individual wants to say (a \\"For me or against me\\"-scenario). Shoehorning in a more literal sense can express itself as pushing a number of individuals into an overfilled enclosure of space, such as a theater or a bus (\\"the usher shoehorned us into the back of the crowded theater\\"). Shoehorning can also refer to an unnatural-seeming inclusion of something for reasons which may range anywhere from demographic-pleasing or political correctness (for example, a token character in a television show or film). In this context, Shoehorning can also refer to including or forcing characters into a plot who have little to no reason to be there except for appeal or marquee value. It can also refer to fitting something where it does not easily fit. The shortened expression honking (as in honking around town) derives from this term, referring to inserting one's self into a place or situation where one does not easily fit or is not welcome.

Open shop vs closed shop The major difference between an open and closed shop is the requirement for union membership.Pynes, Joan. Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations. 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. There are a variety of opinions regarding the benefits and negatives of open shops. =Pros vs. cons of open shops= In the United States, the introduction of 'right to work' laws has been linked with lower overall benefits but higher economic growth by some proponents. Such conclusions are debatable, however, as employment, investment, and income in traditionally unionized sectors of the economy cannot be correlated to passage of such laws. =Union arguments= Open shop means a factory, office, or other business establishment in which a union, chosen by a majority of the employees, acts as representative of all the employees in making agreements with the employer, but in which union membership is not a condition of being hired. Unions have argued against the open shop adopted by United States employers in the first decade of the twentieth century, seeing it as an attempt to drive unions out of industries. For example, construction craft unions have always relied on controlling the supply of labor in particular trades and geographical areas as a means of maintaining union standards and establishing collective bargaining relations with the employers in that field. In order to do that, unions argued, construction unions--and to a lesser extent unions representing musicians, longshore workers, restaurant employees, and others who work on a transitory and relatively brief basis--must require that employers hire only their members. The open shop was also a key component of the American Plan introduced in the 1920s. In that era the open shop was directed not only at construction unions but also unions in mass production industries. Unions again felt that these proposed policies would give employers the opportunity to discriminate against union members in employment and would also lead to a steadfast opposition to collective bargaining of any sort. The legal status of the open shop The term open shop is also used similarly in [Canada], mostly in reference to construction contractors that have at least a partially non-union workforce. Canadians enjoy the freedom to associate, guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, inherently including the right not to associate.Decided in a Quebec Supreme Court case R. v. Advance Cutting & Coring Ltd., in which eight of the nine judges concluded that the freedom to not associate was a logical corollary to the freedom of association. United States labour law outlaws the open shop in its extreme form: it prohibits private sector employers from refusing to hire employees because they are union members just as it prevents discrimination against employees who do not wish to join unions. The open shop in its milder form, in which the open shop represents only an employer's refusal to favor union members for employment, is legal. Although the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter into pre-hire agreements, in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union, employers are under no legal compulsion to enter into such agreements. Non-union construction employers have also adopted the phrase \\"merit shop\\" to describe their operations. In many connotations, the terms are interchangeable, however it may be used differently by different sides of the open shop issue. The open shop is also the legal norm in those states that have adopted right-to-work laws. In those cases, employers are barred from enforcing union security arrangements and may not fire an employee for failure to pay union dues. =Canada= In various Canadian provinces, certain 'open shop' organizations have formed. Many of these organizations claim that small contractors are not adequately protected by current labour legislation. As labour law is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada, the laws vary from province to province. However, there is some common ground. Despite opposition from open shop contractors, in Ontario, the Liberal government recently reinstituted the card-based certification system that was in place for most of the post-World War II period. Card-based certification was reinstated only for the construction industry. It allows workers to certify an exclusive bargaining agent on the basis of membership, sometimes known as \\"majority sign-up.\\" Some observers claim that this system creates a risk of employees being misled by business agents. Others assert that it overcomes the natural advantage that employers in opposition to unionization have over their employees. Some of these associations permit construction contractors that are unionized to join. Several companies whose employees are represented by the Christian Labour Association of Canada or CLAC, a union with non-traditional rules of membership, are members of the association. CLAC's roots trace to the Christian labour movement in the Netherlands.  Janus v. AFSCME  Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, _ US _ (2018) is a US labor law case, concerning whether governments violate the First Amendment when they require their employees to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment. In February 2015, Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner filed suit, claiming that fair-share agreements are unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. In March 2015, three government workers from Illinois represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case. In May 2015, Rauner was dropped from the case, after a federal judge ruled that the governor did not have standing to bring such a suit, but the case proceeded under a new name, Janus v. AFSCME. The case is named after Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees.https://ljc- assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/Rauner-v.-AFSCME-120-First-Amended- Complaint-2015.06.01.pdf This became permissible after a 1977 decision by the US Supreme Court in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. The outcome of the case was in favor of Janus and as such non-union members cannot be compelled to pay fees in accordance with a given fair-share agreement that is in place with respect to a union.

He was regarded as one of the Four Masters of Ming painting. Biography Wen Zhengming was born Wen Bi near present-day Suzhou on November 28, 1470. He would later be known by his courtesy name, Zhengming. He had an elder brother, Wen Gui, who was born in 1469. When Zhengming was two years old, his father, Wen Lin, passed the imperial examination with the highest possible rank, jinshi. Wen Lin was assigned a government position as a magistrate in Yongjia County in Zhejiang province, and left for his job, leaving his two sons in the care of his wife, Qi Shenning. In 1476, Qi died of an illness at the age of 32. Wen Lin commissioned the noted scholar Li Dongyang to write an inscription for her tomb. Wen Zhengming's family was originally from a line of military men who lived in Hengshan County, Hunan province. At the time of his great-great- grandfather Wen Dingcong, the family moved to the city of Changzhou in the Suzhou area. Zhengming was a distant relative of the Song dynasty official Wen Tianxiang, through an ancestor who lived in Hengshan. From this he derived his hao (art name), Hengshan, which he used to sign many of his works. His father Wen Lin and his grandfather Wen Hong (Gongda) were both interested in painting. Wen Lin was also a patron of Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming's contemporary and fellow member of the \\"Four Masters of the Ming dynasty\\". In 1489, Wen Zhengming began studying under Shen Zhou, the eldest of the Four Masters and founder of the Wu school of painting, of which Wen himself later became a leading figure. Zhengming's father Wen Lin died in 1499, while working as prefect of Wenzhou. At Zhengming's request, Shen Zhou provided a written account of Wen Lin's life for the funeral. Wen Zhengming married the daughter of a high-ranking official and jinshi named Wu Yu around the year 1490. Her uncle was the artist Xia Chang, whose paintings of bamboo may have influenced Wen's own work. Little is known about Wen's wife herself, whose personal name was not recorded. After she died in 1542, Wen painted Wintry Trees after Li Cheng for a guest who arrived with a gift to mourn her death. Around 1509–1513, Wang Xianchen, a friend of the Wen family, began construction on the Humble Administrator's Garden, generally considered one of China's greatest classical gardens. The garden is the subject of some of Wen Zhengming's poems and paintings, including an album of thirty-one views painted in 1535 and a second of eight views in 1551. Wen Zhengming's brother Wen Gui died in 1536. Zhengming's eldest son, Wen Peng, was a noted seal- engraver. His second son. Wen Jia, was also an artist, as was his nephew Wen Boren (son of Wen Gui). His great grandson, Wen Zhenheng, a noted garden designer, rebuilt the Garden of Cultivation in Suzhou. His great- granddaughter, Wen Shu, was a popular and respected professional painter of flowers and insects. Style Wen Zhengming was one of a number of Ming dynasty literati artists who set themselves in opposition to the professional, academy-influenced style favored in the region of Zhejiang. Wen and other amateur artists of the Wu school (named after the region around Suzhou, where many of them were based) carried on the wenren () scholar-artist tradition of the preceding dynasties. Eschewing official sponsorship and hostile to the politics of the imperial court, these artists sought private patrons and the respect of their peers, frequently painting works in the style of older masters. Wen studied under the founder of the Wu school, Shen Zhou, whose style he was deeply influenced by. He sometimes added his own poetry to Shen Zhou's paintings, thereby benefitting from the latter's established reputation. After he achieved fame in his own right, Wen's many colophons to Shen Zhou's works often lent them authenticity in the eyes of collectors. Wen and his mentor both revered the artists of the preceding Song and Yuan dynasties, though he rarely imitated them directly. He produced works in a number of styles, and has been called a \\"chameleon\\" whose works could easily be misidentified. Wen's paintings were highly sought after by wealthy collectors throughout the 16th century, and counterfeits of his works were common during the late Ming. Wen Zhengming was also a prolific and well-known writer, whose poems often touched on the subject of painting. He regarded art and nature as being inseparable, and frequently wrote about and painted nature scenes, as well as private gardens such as the Humble Administrator's Garden. In addition to his poetry and painting, Wen Zhengming was also known for his calligraphy. As a young man, Zhengming was introduced by his father Wen Lin to a leading calligrapher of the Suzhou area. By 1541, he was thought to be the greatest calligrapher in China, particularly in the kaishu (regular script) and xingshu (semi-cursive script) styles. As a calligrapher, his technique was influenced by that of the Song dynasty master Huang Tingjian.

Born in Blackpool and raised in Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, Cynthia was accepted into the Junior Art School at the age of 12 and later enrolled at the Liverpool College of Art. Lennon also attended the college, and a meeting with Cynthia in a calligraphy class led to their relationship. When John was performing in Hamburg with the Beatles, Cynthia rented his bedroom at 251 Menlove Avenue in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton from his aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith. After Cynthia became pregnant, she and John married on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant register office in Liverpool and the couple lived at Kenwood in Weybridge from 1964 to 1968, where she kept house and participated with her husband in a London-based social life. In 1968, Lennon left her for Japanese artist Yoko Ono; as a result, the couple's divorce was legally granted on 8 November 1968 on the grounds of adultery. She married Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini in 1970, divorcing him in 1976. In 1978, she married English engineer John Twist, but divorced him in 1982. After her divorce from Twist, she changed her name back to \\"Lennon\\" by deed poll and met Jim Christie, her partner for the next 17 years. She was later married to Noel Charles, a night club owner from Barbados, from 2002 until his death in 2013. She published a book of memoirs, A Twist of Lennon, in 1978, and a more intimate biography, John, in 2005. Over the years, she staged several auctions of memorabilia associated with her life with Lennon. She lived in Calvià in Majorca until her death from cancer in 2015. Early years Cynthia Powell was born in Blackpool on 10 September 1939, the youngest of three children of General Electric Company employee Charles Powell and his wife Lillian (née Roby), who already had two sons named Charles and Anthony. Her parents were from Liverpool, but her mother (along with other pregnant women) was sent to the safer area of Blackpool after World War II had been declared and lived in a small room in a bed-and-breakfast on the Blackpool seafront. After the birth, with Liverpool becoming a frequent target of German air raids, the Powell family moved to a two-bedroomed semi- detached house in Hoylake, a middle-class area on the Wirral Peninsula which was (and still is) considered \\"posh\\" by those in Liverpool. At the age of 11, Cynthia won an art prize in a competition organised by the Liverpool Echo. A year later, she was accepted into Liverpool's Junior Art School, which was also attended by Bill Harry, later the editor of Liverpool's Mersey Beat newspaper. Art college When Powell was 16, her father died from lung cancer after a long illness. Before he died, he told her she would have to get a job to support her mother, and would not be able to go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four apprentice electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: \\"Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia.\\" Powell once overheard Lennon give a compliment to a girl with blonde hair in the college, who looked similar to the French actress Brigitte Bardot. The next Saturday, Powell turned up at the college with her hair several shades blonder. Lennon noticed straight away, exclaiming, \\"Get you, Miss Hoylake!\\" (Lennon's nickname for her, along with \\"Miss Powell\\" or \\"Miss Prim\\"). Dressed like a Teddy Boy, he sometimes brought a guitar with him into class, and once sang \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" directly to Powell. =Relationship with John Lennon= After a college party to celebrate the end of term, Lennon asked Powell if she would like to \\"go out\\" with him. She quickly replied that she was engaged to a young man in Hoylake; he replied, \\"I didn't ask you to fucking marry me, did I?\\" He later approached her and asked if she would go to the Ye Cracke pub. She was confused when he ignored her all evening, but eventually invited her into the group with a joke. The Ye Cracke public house They began dating, with Lennon now referring to her as \\"Cyn\\". In the autumn of 1958, she ended her engagement to be with him, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when he slapped her across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, she broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology. Her work at art school began to suffer, and teachers told her the relationship with Lennon was doing her no good. Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards her, later saying, \\"I was in sort of a blind rage for two years. I was either drunk or fighting. It had been the same with other girl friends I'd had. There was something the matter with me.\\" Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon's since his youth—later said: \\"Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [Lennon] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential. He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side.\\" The Beatles' first Hamburg residency took place in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon's aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for spending a lot of money on a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as \\"a gangster's moll\\", and was often unpleasant towards her. The Beatles went to Hamburg for a second time in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney's girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother's house. After the trip to Hamburg, Powell's mother Lillian said Powell's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new-born baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. After her student grant had run out, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool in order to pay the rent. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in ). from his aunt Elizabeth Sutherland (whom he called \\"Mater\\") who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams. When Lennon went to Hamburg again in April 1962, she found a bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was pregnant with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and did not think about it at the time. When she told Lennon he said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn, we'll have to get married\\". Marriage to Lennon and birth of Julian Powell and Lennon were married on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because as soon as the ceremony began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a pneumatic drill that drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them. During Powell’s pregnancy, Epstein offered her and Lennon the use of his flat at 36 Falkner Street, and later paid for a private hospital room when the pregnancy was coming to term. Although still completely unknown outside Liverpool, by now the Beatles had a fanatical following among girls within the city. Epstein had one condition which the Lennons had to follow: the marriage and the baby were to be kept a close secret, so as not to upset any of these fans. One time when news of the wedding leaked out, the group denied it. Cynthia was happy to keep a low profile, not wanting to be the subject of public attention the way her husband was. The Lennons' son, Julian, was born at 7.45 am on 8 April 1963, in Sefton Hospital. Lennon, being on tour at the time, did not see his son until three days later, and when he finally arrived at the hospital, said: \\"He's bloody marvellous, Cyn! ... Who's gonna be a famous rocker like his Dad then?\\" He then explained that he would be going on a four-day holiday to Barcelona, with Epstein. Lennon later referred to Julian as a \\"Saturday night special; the way that most people get here\\", or said that his son \\"came out of a whisky bottle,\\" suggesting this as explanation for his poor parenting of Julian as compared to his second son, Sean Lennon: \\"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child.\\" Beatlemania Around the time of Julian's birth, the Beatles became a pop sensation across Britain, a phenomenon which became known as Beatlemania. That one of the members was married and had a son was not publicly known at the time; a 1963 \\"Lifelines of the Beatles\\" page in the New Musical Express detailed over 25 biographical facts about each member of the group, but never gave any hint Lennon was married, even reporting \\"girls\\" as one of his hobbies. The press heard rumours about Lennon's wife and child at the end of 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and neighbours protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Brian Epstein told the other Beatles to make the best of the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping out in the hallway, and have to push through them when leaving or arriving. She accompanied Lennon to the United States in the first Beatles' tour there, with Lennon allowing the press to photograph them together, which infuriated Epstein, as he had wanted to keep their marriage a secret. On the tour, she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly ushered into a car, and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was. Lennon's response was, \\"Don't be so bloody slow next time—they could have killed you\\". It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them. At the Emperor's Gate address the situation grew worse, with fans sticking chewing gum in the lock of the flat and tearing at any article of clothing when she or Lennon were leaving or arriving. American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John; the women in the lives of the other Beatles received equivalent missives. As late as 1967, Beatles' wives were still dealing with occasional physical danger from female Beatles' fans, with Cynthia being kicked in the legs by one who demanded she \\"leave John alone!\\" As Lennon was either touring or recording, supposed family holidays in 1966 were skiing in St. Moritz, with producer George Martin and his girlfriend, or staying at a castle in Ireland, with George Harrison and Pattie Boyd (Harrison's wife). Even these were subject to being discovered by fans, and Cynthia and Pattie had to escape the Irish location dressed as maids. As a result of the long recording sessions and tours, Lennon usually slept for days afterwards. When Lennon started filming How I Won the War in Almeria, Spain, he promised his wife and son they could join him there after two weeks of filming. The small apartment they were allocated was swiftly replaced by a villa when Starr and his wife joined them. Kenwood =Domestic life= The Beatles' accountant told Epstein the group members should move to houses near his in Esher, so Lennon bought a house called Kenwood in July 1964. It was a mock-Tudor-style house on three acres in Weybridge, where Cliff Richard already lived. Lennon then spent twice the original £20,000 purchase price (equivalent to £ in ) on renovations for Kenwood, reducing its 22 rooms to 17. The new kitchen was so modern and complicated, someone had to be sent to explain how everything worked, and during the extensive renovations the couple had to live in the attic bedroom for nine months. Although Cynthia enjoyed entertaining in the larger rooms, Lennon could usually be found in a small sunroom at the back of the house overlooking the swimming pool, which was similar to his aunt's conservatory in Liverpool. They had a cat called \\"Mimi\\", named after Lennon's aunt. Cynthia took care of Julian herself, without a nanny, although babysitters were frequently employed. She also did the cooking herself, but employed a housekeeper, gardener, and chauffeur, who lived off the premises. When she passed her driving test, Lennon serially bought her a white Mini, a gold Porsche, a red Ferrari, and a green Volkswagen Beetle, usually as surprises without consulting her first. Cynthia enjoyed the closeness of Pattie Boyd (George Harrison's wife) and Maureen Starkey (Ringo Starr's wife), as both lived nearby, often going on holiday together or shopping. She was often photographed at Beatles' movie premieres and special occasions, and sometimes with Lennon and Julian at home, which meant she had the role of a Beatle wife, as well as being a mother. The Lennons often went to a nightclub in central London until nearly dawn, after which she took Julian to school. Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians, and total strangers who Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs. In 1965, she opened the front door of Kenwood to see a man who \\"looked like a tramp\\", but with her husband's features. He explained that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling her for the first time that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, \\"Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me\\". =Drugs= Cynthia knew her husband took drugs like Preludin, and regularly smoked cannabis but thought of them as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, at a dinner party given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10 mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip. Lennon then started taking LSD on a regular basis in addition to his daily use of cannabis. After much encouragement from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, on the way to a party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: \\"It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love\\". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: \\"I used to just eat it all the time\\". In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple. On 22 July 1967, Harrison, Boyd, Starr, and assistant Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed overnight. Lennon also set off for Athens with his wife and son, McCartney, and Jane Asher (McCartney's girlfriend), Boyd's 16-year-old sister, Paula, roadie Mal Evans, and publicist Alistair Taylor. Looking for an island they could buy to live on together, they chartered a yacht, the MV Arvi. McCartney later said that whilst sailing around Greek islands, everybody just \\"sat around and took LSD\\". Lennon and the other Beatles publicly renounced drugs—although never completely—after their initial meetings with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London, and Bangor, Wales. By 1967, Lennon's aggressive edges from his childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours on end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another). Cynthia once complained, saying: \\"What I'd like is a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me\\". Lennon replied with, \\"OK, I know, we'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?\\" Then adding, \\"No, I've got these bloody songs to write. I have to work, to justify living.\\" She understood his temperament, but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background. =India and Ono= The Beatles were scheduled to fly to India to visit the Maharishi for two or three months of Transcendental Meditation. Before they left, Cynthia found letters from Yoko Ono to Lennon which indicated he had had contact with her over a period of some time. Lennon denied he was involved with Ono, explaining that she was just some \\"crazy artist\\" who wanted to be sponsored, although Ono kept up a stream of telephone calls and visits to Kenwood. On 15 February 1968, the Lennons flew to India, followed by the other Beatles and their partners four days later: Boyd, Asher, and Maureen Starkey (Starr's wife). The division between the sexes was emphasised by the male musicians sitting outside at night composing songs, while their partners gathered together in one of their rooms, often talking about life as the wife or partner of a Beatle. The Lennons shared a four-poster bed at the ashram, with Lennon playing guitar and Cynthia drawing and writing poetry between their long sessions of meditation. \\"Magic Alex\\" (Greek-born Alex Mardas, who controlled Apple Electronics) arrived later, smuggling in alcohol from the nearest village as it was not allowed in the ashram. After two weeks Lennon asked to sleep in a separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: \\"I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end\\". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: \\"I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras\\". =Divorce= During the flight back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed that he had been involved with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and \\"thousands\\" of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon's confession, she knew women were attracted to him, \\"like moths to a flame\\". Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away. Lennon seemed absolutely normal when she returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: \\"It's you I love Cyn ... I love you now more than ever before\\". Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and \\"send her back to Hoylake\\". She said in 2005: \\"The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [Mardas] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy\\" ... [for Lennon and Ono] \\"to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad.\\" As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: \\"Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?\\" When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in ), telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in ), £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in ), and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in ) was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in ). She lived for a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but returned to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no \\"innocent little flower\\". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became \\"Hey Jude\\". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: \\"We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\\". Cynthia recalled, \\"I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\\" She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: \\"It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days\\". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" about an affair he was having, but rendered it in \\"gobbledegook\\" so Cynthia would not know. Subsequent life On 31 July 1970, Cynthia married Bassanini, whom she had started dating after parting with Lennon; the couple divorced in 1976. She then opened a restaurant in Ruthin, Wales, called Oliver's Bistro, which also had a B&B; above the premises. She enrolled her son into the Ruthin School and he later joined the local Combined Cadet Force. During Lennon's separation from Ono in 1973/74, his partner at the time, May Pang, actively tried to get Lennon to spend more time with his son, forming a friendship with Lennon's ex-wife in the process, which continued even after Lennon and Ono were reconciled. A meeting during this period was the last time Cynthia saw John. Previously, Julian had been allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself, but Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex-wife also wanted to be present, saying: \\"She [Cynthia] thought she could walk back in 'cos I wasn't with Yoko!\\" After his reconciliation with Ono, he complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him. On 1 May 1978, Cynthia married John Twist, an engineer from Lancashire. She published a memoir during their time together, A Twist of Lennon, in 1978, telling about her life before and with Lennon, and containing her own illustrations and poetry. Lennon tried to stop the publication of the book after an excerpt was published in a newspaper. On 9 December 1980 (UK time), whilst staying at the home of Ringo Starr's ex-wife, Maureen, she received a phone call from Starr, two hours after Lennon had been fatally shot in New York. \\"The memory of Ringo's words, the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line, is crystal clear: 'Cynthia, I'm so sorry, John's dead'. I had only one clear thought. My son, our son, [Julian] was at home in bed, I had to get back to Ruthin so that I could tell him about his father's death.\\" Cynthia's memoir gained renewed interest and went to a third printing of 200,000 copies in the weeks after Lennon's death. She and Twist separated in 1981 and were divorced in 1982. She sold the Bistro and changed her name back to Lennon by deed poll, later commenting about why it was financially necessary: \\"Do you imagine I would have been awarded a three-year contract to design bedding and textiles [for Vantona Vyella in 1983] with the name Powell? Neither did they. When it is necessary to earn a living, it is necessary to bite the bullet and take the flack.\\" She began a relationship with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981, who became her partner for 17 years as well as her business manager, living in Penrith, Cumbria. She said at the time: \\"Jim has never felt he's living in John Lennon's shadow. He's four years younger than me and wasn't really part of that whole Beatles' scene.\\" They later lived on the Isle of Man and then in Normandy for some years, but separated in 1998. She had kept mementos of Lennon for years, but began auctioning them off after his death. This included a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. With her finances in an unsteady state – she would say in 1999 that \\"Apart from John, the men I have fallen in love with have never been good at earning a living\\" – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. She said at the time, \\"I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change.\\" Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, \\"I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When you have to pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you.\\" Over the years she entered some failed business ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as Rubber Sole (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it was considered to be far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her. The Beatles' Hamburg days were the subject of the 1994 film Backbeat, with Jennifer Ehle portraying Cynthia Powell. The film characterises Lennon and Cynthia's relationship as one that will eventually be doomed by their wanting different things from life, but with Lennon not wanting to hurt her. Cynthia later complained that the film made her out \\"as a clingy, dim, little girlfriend in a headscarf\\". In another film covering the early years of the pre-fame Beatles, the 1979 Birth of the Beatles, she was portrayed by Wendy Morgan.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078865/?ref_=nm_knf_t3 She was portrayed in 2000 television film In His Life: The John Lennon Story by Gillian Kearney; the negative aspects of John's treatment towards her were not overlooked. Cynthia was subsequently portrayed in the troubled, Ono-centric 2005 American musical Lennon, with her character – played by Julia Murney – gaining a little more prominence during one of the show's rewrites. Her life had a more central role in the 2010 BBC Four film Lennon Naked, with Claudie Blakley playing the part. However, her character was absent from the 2009 British film Nowhere Boy, which purported to cover the story of Lennon from 1955 to 1960 but focused on his relationships with his aunt and mother. In 1995, Cynthia made her recording début with a rendition of \\"Those Were the Days\\" which, produced by McCartney, had been a number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968. It failed to chart. Whilst she was living in Normandy, an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road's KDK Gallery in 1999. By the 1990s, she was appearing at some Beatles conventions, but appeared ambivalent about doing so. At times she maintained she was moving on with her life and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable. The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile, \\"In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost in spite of herself – got caught up with one of the most extraordinary men of modern times. More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended, she is as entangled as ever.\\" Later years and death Cynthia and Julian Lennon at the unveiling ceremony of the John Lennon Peace Monument in Liverpool, 9 October 2010, John Lennon's 70th birthday In 2002, she married Noel Charles, a Barbadian night club owner.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/cynthia- lennon-the-first-wife-of-john-lennon-whose-steadfastness-was-rewarded-by- cruel-treatment-at-10150200.html In September 2005, she published a new biography, John, re-examining her life with Lennon and the years afterwards, including the events following his death. Michel Faber, writing in The Guardian, said of the book: \\"John is Cynthia's attempt to prove how much more she was worth. In theory, the disclosures of Lennon's loyal partner from 1958 to 1968 cannot fail to be valuable. On the page, the potential withers\\". In 2006, she and her son attended the Las Vegas premiere of the Cirque du Soleil production of Love, which marked a rare public appearance with Ono. In 2009, she and her son opened an exhibition of memorabilia at The Beatles Story exhibition in Liverpool, and she and Pattie Boyd staged a first-ever joint appearance at the opening of the Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Yerevan, Armenia. On 30 September 2010, Julian opened his \\"Timeless\\" exhibition of photographs at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York. In attendance were Cynthia, Julian, Ono, Sean, and Pang, which was the first time all five had been in the same room together. The John Lennon Peace Monument was unveiled by Cynthia and Julian at a ceremony in Chavasse Park, Liverpool, on 9 October 2010 to celebrate the anniversary of Lennon's 70th birthday. Cynthia lived with her husband, Noel, on the island of Majorca in Spain until his death on 11 March 2013.https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/obituary- cynthia-lennon---beautiful-8966003 She died on 1 April 2015 at her home in Majorca, Spain, at the age of 75 after a short struggle with cancer, with her son Julian by her side. Public messages of condolence were made by McCartney and Starr, with the former saying \\"She was a lovely lady who I've known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all ...\\" and the latter \\"Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia\\". Ono also issued a statement, emphasizing the position she held in common: \\"Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy. Cynthia and I understood each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future.\\" Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, who had spent considerable time with her and John in the 1960s while researching his book, remembered her as \\"a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet, reserved and calm.\\"  References  Sources    * Also adapted for publication in         External links * The Beatles First Wives Club * Memorial Page Category:1939 births Category:2015 deaths Cynthia Category:People from Blackpool Category:People from Hoylake Category:English women writers Category:Alumni of Liverpool College of Art Category:Transcendental Meditation practitioners Category:English expatriates in Spain Category:Deaths from cancer in Spain Category:British writers Category:Wives of the Beatles ","title":"Cynthia Lennon"},{"id":"1149625","text":"Nalcrest is a retirement community in Polk County, Florida, United States.

It was the brainchild of William Doherty, the first United States Ambassador to Jamaica and NALC President from 1941–1962. Construction began on the community in July 1962 and the community opened in 1963. Initially, due to HUD regulations, residency was open to both NALC members and others, but when the mortgage was paid in 2002, the HUD restrictions were removed and residency is now limited to NALC retirees in good standing only. The community consists of , of which are developed into 500 garden-style apartments. The remaining are undeveloped and includes a manmade lake of 15 acres around which the community is developed, and that is connected to the 7,500 acre Lake Weohyakapka. The apartments are a mix of efficiency and one-bedroom units, and all are on ground level. Units are leased on an annual basis and the rental rate includes water, sewer, trash removal, basic cable TV, interior/exterior maintenance, and use of the community's recreational facilities (but not electricity). Pets are not permitted. In addition to being NALC retirees in good standing, tenants must also be able to care for themselves and for housekeeping chores, as the community is not an assisted living facility and does not have an on-site physician.Nalcrest information from NALC Prospective tenants must pay the first month's rent and a security deposit. Previously, the only form of payment accepted was a postal money order, but now checks and all types of money orders are accepted. Many residents vote by mail. Among the most interesting features of the community is that, despite being a retirement community for postal letter carriers, there is no home mail delivery - residents must pick up their mail at the post office in the Town Center.

He is best known as the radio voice of the Lone Ranger. The Lone Ranger Brace Beemer became the third radio voice of the Lone Ranger on April 18, 1941, after the death of Earle Graser and remained so until the series' last new episode on September 3, 1954. During the 13 years that Beemer played the title character, he was required by contract to restrict his radio acting to that one role until the program left the air. The experienced and popular Western film actor, Clayton Moore, was chosen to take over the role for the television series. Although Beemer had the right voice and had made many public appearances as the Ranger, he had no experience as a film actor, as he preferred live action to television. However, Beemer's voice as the character was so familiar that Moore imitated his sound in the earliest TV episodes. Other roles Beemer also portrayed Sergeant William Preston of the Yukon on Challenge of the Yukon, for a brief time after the Lone Ranger series ended. Beemer's last TV appearance was an interview with former film actor Bill Kennedy on his At the Movies show on CKLW TV9 from Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Beemer died the next day. Early years Brace Bell Beemer was born at his home on Cherry Street in Mount Carmel, Illinois on December 9, 1902, the son of Joseph D. Beemer and Bertina (Bell) Beemer. He attended high school in Vincennes, Indiana, leaving school to enlist in the military. When Beemer was 14, he misrepresented his age to participate in World War I. He served with \\"Battery E, 150th field artillery, and was wounded in action in France May 27,\\" 1918. He was said to be the youngest sergeant in that war. Later years Beemer resided in Oxford Township, Michigan. He raised thoroughbred horses on his 300-acre ranch, Paint Creek Acres.

The government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not to exceed 75% of the premium for any one plan (calculated separately for individual and family coverage). The FEHB program allows some insurance companies, employee associations, and labor unions to market health insurance plans to governmental employees. The program is administered by the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). History The program was created in 1960. Employer sponsorship of health insurance in the United States became prevalent during World War II, as one of the few ways by which employers could escape wage and price control limitations on employee wages. The government originally proposed a system that would revolve around a dominant government-directed plan, but unions and employee associations, which had sponsored their own plans, protested. Reflecting the political pressure thus created, the Congress modified the Executive Branch proposal and all existing plans were \\"grandfathered\\" into the program.Odin Anderson and Joel May Thus, through what was essentially a historical accident and a political compromise, a system of competition among health plans driven by consumer choices was created. Plans Choices among health plans are available to employees during an \\"open enrollment\\" period, or \\"open season,\\" after which the employee will be covered fully in any plan he or she chooses without limitations regarding pre-existing conditions. After the annual enrollment, changes can be made only upon a \\"qualifying life event\\" such as marriage, divorce, adoption or birth of a child, or change in employment status of a spouse, until the next annual open season, during which employees can enroll, disenroll, or change from one plan to another. The exact dates of the open season change from year to year, but are usually from the Monday of the second full week in November through Monday, the second full week of December. Enrollment begins at or near the beginning of the calendar year, and lasts until a different plan choice is made in a subsequent open season or through a qualifying life event. In practice, there is a great deal of inertia in enrollment, and only about 5 percent of employees change plans in most open seasons. Premiums vary from plan to plan and are paid in part by the employer (the U. S. government agency that the employee works for or, for annuitants, OPM) and the remainder by the employee. The employer pays an amount up to 72 percent of the average plan premium for self-only or family coverage (not to exceed 75 percent of the premium for the selected plan), and the employee pays the rest. This dollar amount is recalculated each year as health care costs and plans' premiums increase. Certain employees (such as postal workers) have a higher portion of their premiums paid as the result of collective bargaining agreements. The precise percentage of the average paid by the employer is relatively unimportant to the design of this program and has changed over time to become more generous. What is important is that it is a \\"capped premium\\" design, in which the entire marginal cost of joining a plan with a premium near, at, or above the all-plan average is borne by the enrollee. In other words, enrollees pay the entire cost of their costly choices, but reap rewards if they make frugal choices. This creates constant pressure on the plans, since to attract enrollees they must hold down costs, while balancing this incentive against benefit offerings and customer service, to reach a position that will maximize their enrollment revenues and profits. This feature of the program is arguably its greatest strength and the primary reason that one expert summarized it as having \\"outperformed Medicare every which way—in containment of costs both to consumers and to the government, in benefit and product innovation and modernization, and in consumer satisfaction,\\" decade after decade.Harry Cain, p. 30. In 2010 about 250 plans participate in the program.Walton Francis and editors, p. 4. About 20 plans are nationwide or almost nationwide, such as the ones offered by some employee unions such as the National Association of Letter Carriers, by some employee associations, and by national insurance companies such as Aetna and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association on behalf of its member companies. There are about 230 locally available plans, almost all HMOs. The FEHB program is open to most federal employees. For example, as of 2014 members of the United States Congress and their staff are excluded from the FEHB and required to purchase health insurance through the health care exchange due to the Affordable Care Act. However, the federal government provides a premium contribution for the purchase of this health insurance. The FEHBP's cost is about $40 billion in 2010, including both premiums and out-of-pocket costs. It enrolls about four million employees and annuitants and, with their dependents, eight million persons in total. While its enrollment is about one-fifth that of the nation's largest health insurance program, Medicare, it spends less than one-tenth as much because most enrollees are below age 65 and cost far less on average than the elderly and disabled who constitute Medicare's enrollees. The FEHB program relies on consumer choices among competing private plans to determine costs, premiums, benefits, and service. This model is in sharp contrast to that used by original Medicare. In Medicare, premiums, benefits, and payment rates are all centrally determined by law or regulation (there is no bargaining and no reliance on volume discounts in original Medicare; these parameters are set by fiat). Some have criticized the FEHB model because neither the monopsony power nor purchasing power of the federal government is utilized to control costs. This controversy is similar to that which surrounded legislation for the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage passed during the George W. Bush administration. Over time, however, the FEHB program has outperformed original Medicare not only in cost control, but also in benefit improvement, enrollee service, fraud prevention, and avoidance of \\"pork barrel\\" spending and earmarks.Walton Francis, p. 193. (Medicare Part D has also controlled costs far better than originally forecast through a competitive, consumer-driven system of plan choices similar to and modeled after the FEHB program.) One of the most prominent features of the FEHB program is the choices it allows. There are three broad types of plans: fee-for-service and preferred provider organization (PPO), usually offered in combination; HMOs; and high-deductible health plans and other consumer-driven plans. In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, plans open to all federal employees and annuitants include 10 fee-for-service and PPO plans, seven HMOs, and eight high-deductible and consumer-driven plans.Walton Francis and editors, p. 23. A similar number of choices is offered in almost all large metropolitan areas, and in many smaller cities and rural areas. The program is sometimes criticized for offering this broad array of choices, but there are many ways enrollees can obtain advice and assistance, including advice from office colleagues and friends, newspaper and magazine articles in both the general press and publications that specialize in federal employees or retirees, OPM publications and Web site, and several online tools that compare plans' costs, benefits, and services. As a noticeably consumer-friendly service, OPM requires that all plans publish brochures that describe benefits in plain English and in a standardized format that facilitates plan comparison and that can easily be downloaded in PDF format.U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web Site for Federal Employee Health Plans; Walton Francis and editors online version. Almost all plans provide Web sites that provide detailed information not only on their benefits, but also on their provider panels and their drug formularies. There is no published evidence that either in the FEHB program or in the other two federal programs that offer a wide range of plan choices, the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug programs, consumer confusion is a serious problem, or that health insurance choices are any more complicated to deal with than other consumer choices among complex products or services, such as choices as to automobile purchase or service, choice among physicians, or choice among life insurance and other insurance products. One study found that on the whole Medicare beneficiaries, who are both elderly and far less educated than the population at large, nonetheless were able to substantially reduce their drug costs by choosing, albeit imperfectly, Medicare prescription drug plans that reduced their drug costs from what would have been considerably higher costs.Jonathan Gruber. A recent evaluation of the FEHB program found that Open Season movement reduces premiums on average by about 1 percent compared to prior enrollment patterns, despite the tendency of enrollees to remain in current plans without considering alternative choices.Walton Francis, p.49. In the FEHB program the federal government sets minimal standards that, if met by an insurance company, allows it to participate in the program. The result is numerous competing insurance plans that are available to federal employees. Local plans have ready access to participation in the program, but the underlying statute prohibits entry of new national plans. Because OPM requires plans to price offerings closely to the health care costs of enrollees, and to offer comprehensive benefits, there is broad similarity in plan offerings. However, total premiums can vary substantially, and in 2010 the lowest cost plan option has a self-only premium cost of about $2,800 and the highest cost plan option for self-only enrollment is about $7,200.Walton Francis and editors, p. 54. As an example of benefit variation, a cap of about $5,000 a year on potential out-of-pocket costs for self-only enrollment is found in a number of plans, but in some plans the cap may reach $15,000 or more (HMOs typically have no cap, but control potential cost exposure by using copayments). The underlying legislation for the FEHB program is minimal and remarkably stable, particularly in comparison to Medicare. The FEHB statute is only a few dozen pages long, and only a few paragraphs are devoted to the structure and functioning of the program. Regulations are minimal; only another few dozen pages. In contrast, the Medicare statute found in title 18 of the Social Security Act is about 400 pages long and the accompanying regulations consume thousands of pages in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. The FEHB program has often been proposed as a model for national health insurance and sometimes as a program that could directly enroll the uninsured. These proposals began within its first decadeOdin Anderson and Joel May and have continued ever since.Walton Francis, pp. 4–6. Notable economist Alain Enthoven explicitly built a proposal for a system of \\"managed competition\\" as a national health reform decades ago, and has continued promoting the idea ever since.Alain Enthoven A version of this proposal was recently adopted by the Netherlands. In the 2004 presidential campaign, Senator John Kerry proposed opening enrollment in this plan to all Americans. In enacting the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, the Congress explicitly modeled the reformed Medicare Advantage program and the new Medicare Part D Prescription Drug program after the FEHB program.Walton Francis, pp. 8–9. One of the prominent proposals for health reform in the United States, the proposed bipartisan Wyden-Bennett Act is largely modeled after the FEHB program, as have recent \\"Republican Alternative\\" proposals by Representative Paul Ryan.

Rising nearly 300 feet (91 m) above the surrounding North Platte River valley, the peak of Chimney Rock is above sea level. The formation served as a landmark along the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail during the mid-19th century. The trails ran along the north side of the rock, which remains a visible landmark for modern travelers along U.S. Route 26 and Nebraska Highway 92. History Prior to exploration and settlement by European immigrants, the Native Americans of the areamainly the Lakota Siouxwould refer to this formation by a term which meant \\"elk penis\\".Chimney Rock, (Atlas Obscura, retrieved on November 21st, 2015). The first non-natives to see the pillar were probably the Astorians of Robert Stuart in their eastward journey from the Pacific Ocean in 1813. Chimney Rock was recorded in many journals after the Stuart expedition.Chimney Rock National Historic Site, Nebraska, National Park Service, 1964 The name \\"Chimney Rock\\" probably originated from early fur traders.\\"Chimney Rock History\\" The first recorded mention of \\"Chimney Rock\\" was in 1827 by Joshua Pilcher. Pilcher had journeyed up the Platte River valley to the Salt Lake rendezvous of the Rocky Mountain fur trappers. The formation went through a variety of names before becoming Chimney Rock such as Chimley Rock and Chimney Tower, as well as euphemisms based on the original Native American name, such as Elk's Peak and Elk Brick. A small town named Chimney Rock once stood near the base of the formation. A post office was established at the town of Chimney Rock in 1913, and remained in operation until 1922. Based on sketches, paintings, written accounts, and the 1897 photograph by Darton, Chimney Rock was taller when it was first seen by settlers, but has since been reduced in height by erosion and lightning. Geology Chimney Rock consists primarily of Brule clay interlayered with volcanic ash and Arikaree sandstone. The harder sandstone layers near the top have protected the pillar since it broke away from the retreating cliff line to the south. Chimney Rock rises approximately above its surroundings. Today A Close-Up of Chimney Rock Chimney Rock from the north (2016) Chimney Rock was designated a National Historic Site on August 9, 1956, and is a National Park Service designated area, though it is maintained and administered by History Nebraska. Chimney Rock and Independence Rock further west in Wyoming are two of the prominent features along the Oregon Trail.

Baron François Joseph Bosio (19 March 1768 – 29 July 1845) was a Monegasque sculptor who achieved distinction in the first quarter of the nineteenth century with his work for Napoleon and for the restored French monarchy.His brother Jean-François Bosio (1764–1827) was a pupil of David, whose son Astyanax-Scévola (died 1876) trained as a sculptor in the studio of his uncle François-Joseph. See James David Draper, \\"Thirty Famous People: Drawings by Sergent-Marceau and Bosio, Milan, 1815–1818\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal 13 (1978), pp. 113–130 Biography Portrait of Bosio by Julien-Léopold Boilly Born in Monaco, Bosio was given a scholarship by prince Honoré I to study in Paris with the eminent sculptor Augustin Pajou. After brief service in the Revolutionary army he lived in Florence, Rome and Naples, providing sculpture for churches under the French hegemony in Italy in the 1790s. He was recruited by Dominique Vivant Denon in 1808 to make bas-reliefs for the monumental column in the Place Vendôme in Paris and also to serve as portrait sculptor to Emperor Napoleon I and his family. It was in this capacity that he produced some of his finest work, notably marble portrait busts of the Empress Josephine, which was also modelled in biscuit Sèvres porcelain, and of Queen Hortense (about 1810), which was also cast in bronze by Ravrio.An example is conserved at Malmaison. Louis XVIII made Bosio a Knight of the Order of Saint Michael in 1821 and appointed him premier sculpteur du Roi. In 1828, Bosio saw his grandiose equestrian sculpture of Louis XIV erected in the Place des Victoires in Paris and was made an Officier of the Légion d'honneur. He was made a baron by Charles X of France in 1825. Though under Louis-Philippe he was stripped of his titles, he continued to receive official commissions, as the ablest portrait sculptor in Paris, and created the statue of Napoleon for the Column of the Grande Armée in 1840 under Napoleon III. He died in Paris. Apart from the imperial busts and the statue of Louis XVI, other important works included the quadriga of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and the statue of Hercules fighting Acheloos transformed into a snake (illustration) in the Louvre. Many of his most important sculptures and statues can today be found in the Louvre museum in Paris. A study of Bosio was published by L. Barbarin, Etude sur Bosio, sa vie et son oeuvre (Monaco) 1910.

The CD36 antigen is an integral membrane protein found on the surface of many cell types in vertebrate animals. It imports fatty acids inside cells and is a member of the class B scavenger receptor family of cell surface proteins. CD36 binds many ligands including collagen, thrombospondin, erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum, oxidized low density lipoprotein, native lipoproteins, oxidized phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids. Work in genetically modified rodents suggest a role for CD36 in fatty acid metabolism, heart disease, taste, and dietary fat processing in the intestine. It may be involved in glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiomyopathy and Alzheimer's disease.  Structure  = Primary = In humans, rats and mice, CD36 consists of 472 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 53,000 Da. However, CD36 is extensively glycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight of 88,000 Da as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. = Tertiary = Using Kyte-Doolittle analysis, the amino acid sequence of CD36 predicts a hydrophobic region near each end of the protein large enough to span cellular membranes. Based on this notion and the observation that CD36 is found on the surface of cells, CD36 is thought to have a 'hairpin-like' structure with α-helices at the C- and N- termini projecting through the membrane and a larger extracellular loop (Fig. 1). This topology is supported by transfection experiments in cultured cells using deletion mutants of CD36. Based on the crystal structure of the homologous SCARB2, a model of the extracellular domain of CD36 has been produced. Like SCARB2, CD36 is proposed to contain an antiparallel β-barrel core with many short α-helices adorning it. The structure is predicted to contain a hydrophobic transport tunnel. Disulfide linkages between 4 of the 6 cysteine residues in the extracellular loop are required for efficient intracellular processing and transport of CD36 to the plasma membrane. It is not clear what role these linkages play on the function of the mature CD36 protein on the cell surface. = Posttranslational modification = Besides glycosylation, additional posttranslational modifications have been reported for CD36. CD36 is modified with 4 palmitoyl chains, 2 on each of the two intracellular domains. The function of these lipid modifications is currently unknown but they likely promote the association of CD36 with the membrane and possibly lipid rafts which appear to be important for some CD36 functions. CD36 could be also phosphorylated at Y62, T92, T323, ubiquitinated at K56, K469, K472 and acetylated at K52, K56, K166, K231, K394, K398, K403. = Protein-protein interactions = In the absence of ligand, membrane bound CD36 exists primarily in a monomeric state. However exposure to the thrombospondin ligand causes CD36 to dimerize. This dimerization has been proposed to play an important role in CD36 signal transduction.  Genetics  In humans, the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at band 11.2 (7q11.2) and is encoded by 15 exons that extend over more than 32 kilobases. Both the 5' and the 3' untranslated regions contain introns: the 5' with two and the 3' one. Exons 1, 2 and first 89 nucleotides of exon 3 and as well as exon 15 are non- coding. Exon 3 contains encodes the N-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The C-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions is encoded by exon 14. The extracellular domain is encoded by the central 11 exons. Alternative splicing of the untranslated regions gives rise to at least two mRNA species. The transcription initiation site of the CD36 gene has been mapped to 289 nucleotides upstream from the translational start codon and a TATA box and several putative cis regulatory regions lie further 5'. A binding site for PEBP2/CBF factors has been identified between -158 and -90 and disruption of this site reduces expression. The gene is the transcriptional control of the nuclear receptor PPAR/RXR heterodimer (Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor – Retinoid X receptor) and gene expression can be up regulated using synthetic and natural ligands for PPAR and RXR, including the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs and the vitamin A metabolite 9-cis-retinoic acid respectively.  Tissue distribution  CD36 is found on platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, differentiated adipocytes, skeletal muscle, mammary epithelial cells, spleen cells and some skin microdermal endothelial cells.  Function  The protein itself belongs to the class B scavenger receptor family which includes receptors for selective cholesteryl ester uptake, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMP-II). CD36 interacts with a number of ligands, including collagen types I and IV, thrombospondin, erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum, platelet-agglutinating protein p37, oxidized low density lipoprotein and long-chain fatty acids. On macrophages CD36 forms part of a non-opsonic receptor (the scavenger receptor CD36/alphaV beta3 complex) and is involved in phagocytosis. CD36 has also been implicated in hemostasis, thrombosis, malaria, inflammation, lipid metabolism and atherogenesis. On binding a ligand the protein and ligand are internalized. This internalization is independent of macropinocytosis and occurs by an actin dependent mechanism requiring the activation Src-family kinases, JNK and Rho-family GTPases. Unlike macropinocytosis this process is not affected by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Na+/H+ exchange. CD36 ligands have also been shown to promote sterile inflammation through assembly of a Toll-like receptor 4 and 6 heterodimer. Recently, CD36 was linked to store-operated calcium flux, phospholipase A2 activation, and production of prostaglandin E2 CD36 function in long-chain fatty acid uptake and signaling can be irreversibly inhibited by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), which binds lysine 164 within a hydrophobic pocked shared by several CD36 ligands, e.g. fatty acid and oxLDL. Recent researches concluded that the CD36 is involved in the fat taste transduction (olegustus).  Clinical significance  = Malaria = Infections with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are characterized by sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature forms of the parasite and CD36 has been shown to be a major sequestration receptor on microvascular endothelial cells. Parasitised erythrocytes adhere to endothelium at the trophozoite/schizonts stage simultaneous with the appearance of the var gene product (erythrocyte membrane protein 1) on the erythrocyte surface. The appearance of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the erythrocyte surface is a temperature dependent phenomenon which is due to increased protein trafficking to the erythrocyte surface at the raised temperature. PfEMP1 can bind other endothelial receptors - thrombospondin (TSP) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) – in addition to CD36 - and genes other than PfEMP1 also bind to CD36: cytoadherence linked protein (clag) and sequestrin. The PfEMP1 binding site on CD36 is known to be located on exon 5. CD36 on the surface of the platelets has been shown to be involved in adherence but direct adherence to the endothelium by the infected erythrocytes also occurs. Autoaggregation of infected erythrocytes by platelets has been shown to correlate with severe malaria and cerebral malaria in particular and antiplatelet antibodies may offer some protection. Several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in CD36 are protective against malaria: mutations in the promoters and within introns and in exon 5 reduce the risk of severe malaria. Gene diversity studies suggest there has been positive selection on this gene presumably due to malarial selection pressure. Dissenting reports are also known suggesting that CD36 is not the sole determinant of severe malaria. In addition a role for CD36 has been found in the clearance of gametocytes (stages I and II). CD36 has been shown to have a role in the innate immune response to malaria in mouse models. Compared with wild type mice CD36 (-/-) mice the cytokine induction response and parasite clearance were impaired. Earlier peak parasitemias, higher parasite densities and higher mortality were noted. It is thought that CD36 is involved in the Plasmodium falciparum glycophosphatidylinositol (PfGPI) induced MAPK activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. When macrophages were exposed to PfGPI the proteins ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and c-Jun became phosphorylated. All these proteins are involved as secondary messengers in the immune response. These responses were blunted in the CD36 (-/-) mice. Also in the CD36 (-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less TNF-alpha on exposure to PfGPI. Work is ongoing to determine how these exactly how these responses provide protection against malaria. = CD36 deficiency and alloimmune thrombocytopenia = CD36 is also known as glycoprotein IV (gpIV) or glycoprotein IIIb (gpIIIb) in platelets and gives rise to the Naka antigen. The Naka null phenotype is found in 0.3% of Caucasians and appears to be asymptomatic. The null phenotype is more common in African (2.5%), Japanese, and other Asian populations (5-11%). Mutations in the human CD36 gene were first identified in a patient who, despite multiple platelet transfusions, continued to exhibit low platelet levels. This condition is known as refractoriness to platelet transfusion. Subsequent studies have shown that CD36 found on the surface of platelets. This antigen is recognized by the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) OKM5 and OKM8. It is bound by the Plasmodium falciparum protein sequestrin. Depending on the nature of the mutation in codon 90 CD36 may be absent either on both platelets and monocytes (type 1) or platelets alone (type 2). Type 2 has been divided into two subtypes - a and b. Deficiency restricted to the platelets alone is known as type 2a; if CD36 is also absent from the erythoblasts the phenotype is classified as type 2b. The molecular basis is known for some cases: T1264G in both Kenyans and Gambians; C478T (50%), 539 deletion of AC and 1159 insertion of an A, 1438-1449 deletion and a combined 839-841 deletion GAG and insertion of AAAAC in Japanese. In a study of 827 apparently healthy Japanese volunteers, type I and II deficiencies were found in 8 (1.0%) and 48 (5.8%) respectively. In 1127 healthy French blood donors (almost all of whom were white Europeans) no CD36 deficiency was found. In a second group only 1 of 301 white test subjects was found to be CD36 deficient. 16 of the 206 sub-Saharan black Africans and 1 of 148 black Caribbeans were found to be CD36 -ve. Three of 13 CD36 -ve persons examined had anti CD36 antibodies. In a group of 250 black American blood donors 6 (2.4%) were found to be Naka antigen negative. CD36 deficiency may be a cause of post transfusion purpura. = Blood pressure = Below normal levels of CD36 expression in the kidneys has been implicated as a genetic risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure). = Fatty acid uptake = An association with myocardial fatty acid uptake in humans has been noted. The data suggest a link between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and CD36 but this needs to be confirmed. = Tuberculosis = RNAi screening in a Drosophila model has revealed that a member of the CD36 family is required for phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into macrophage phagosomes. = Obesity = CD36's association with the ability to taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the obese and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in the obese mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats. There has been some investigation into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between the high and low groups. This study demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future. = Establishment of cellular senescence = Upregulation of CD36 could contribute to membrane remodeling during senescence. In response to various senescence‐inducing stimuli, CD36 stimulate NF-κB‐dependent inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, a phenomenon known as the senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This secretory molecule production leads to the onset of a comprehensive senescent cell fate. Cancer CD36 plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis, which may be a therapeutic strategy for controlling the spread of cancer. Some data from in vitro and animal studies suggested that fatty acid uptake through CD36 may promote cancer cell migration and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and potentially other cancers; there was limited data from observational studies in people that low CD36 may correlate with a slightly better outcome in glioblastoma.  Interactions  CD36 has been shown to interact with FYN. Related proteins Other human scavenger receptors related to CD36 are SCARB1 and SCARB2 proteins.

Taxonomy The diederik cuckoo was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Cuculus caprius in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The diederik cuckoo is now placed in the genus Chrysococcyx that was erected by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The species is monotypic. The generic name Chrysococcyx combines the Ancient Greek khrusos meaning \\"gold\\" and kokkux meaning \\"cuckoo\\". The specific epithet caprius is from the Latin cupreus meaning \\"coppery\\". The common name \\"diederik\\" is from Afrikaans \\"diedrik\\", an onomatopoeic rendition of the bird's call. Description At Rietvlei Nature Reserve, Gauteng, South Africa The diederik cuckoo is a smallish cuckoo at 18 to 20 cm. Adult males are glossy green above with copper-sheened areas on the back and whitish underparts. They have a broken white eye-stripe and a short, green malar stripe. All remiges have three to four white spots on the inner vanes. The four green outer tail feathers are tipped white, and the outermost pair are spotted white on both vanes. Females show more copper above, and have coppery barring on the flanks. The underparts are often washed brownish. Juveniles have a red bill, streaky throat and a white wing-bar. They are more copper-coloured above and browner below than the females, and the flank markings are brown blotches. Behaviour =Breeding= The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite. It lays a single egg mostly in the nests of weavers, especially the village weaver and the bishops in the genus Euplectes. For example, it has been recorded in red-collared widowbirds. =Feeding= The diederik cuckoo takes a variety of insects and caterpillars. It is a noisy species, with the persistent and loud deed-deed-deed-deed-er-ick call from which it gets its name. Usually four clear, roughly identical, notes followed by a little twitter. Distribution and habitat It is a common resident breeder in Sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula. It has been recorded as far north as Cyprus (1982). It is a short-distance seasonal migrant, moving with the rains. It is a solitary bird, found in open woodland, savanna and riverside bushes.

It is part of the municipality of Het Hogeland. Warfhuizen consists of two man-made mounds, called wierden, designed to escape the floodwaters of the Wadden, which flooded the whole region several times a year before dykes had been coed. The smaller mound was originally raised to protect a separate village called Burum. The village church stands on the larger mound. The Church \\"Our Lady the Garden Enclosed\\", statue in the hermitage church of Warfhuizen. The church belongs to the hermitage of Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden, one of the few hermitages in the Netherlands still inhabited by a hermit. The church, which was first constructed in the 13th century, was replaced by a neo-classical building in 1858. Only the bell survived the ages and is even one of the oldest churchbells in the Netherlands. The building is dedicated to Saint Ludger and Our Lady under the title of \\"the Enclosed Garden\\". The present organ was built in 1910, but was in fact reconstructed from two organs of a much earlier date (17th and 18th century.) The church is especially known for its statue of the Mother of Sorrows, sculpted by one of the renowned procession-sculptors of Seville, Miguel Bejarano Moreno. It is because of this very Andalusian image that some Spaniards living in the Netherlands use Warfhuizen as a place of (unofficial) pilgrimage. In the last years their habit spread to all Catholics in the region and even beyond: Warfhuizen became the northernmost Marian sanctuary of continental Europe. A peculiar custom, unique for this shrine, is 'the trading of the handkerchief'. It is said that visitors bring a new white handkerchief and ask the hermit to swap it with the one held by the sorrowful Virgin whose handkerchief is then presented to someone sick, lonely or elderly in the audience. Little is documented about this alleged custom. The origins of this particular custom are unknown, although a widespread rumor tells that it started with catholic pilgrims from the south of India and Sri Lanka, but the reasons behind this rumor are unexplained.

Knurling method: left/right with tips raised, spiral angle: 30°, pitch: 1 mm, profile angle: 90° Knurling is a manufacturing process, typically conducted on a lathe, whereby a pattern of straight, angled or crossed lines is rolled into the material.  Etymology  The terms knurl and knurled are from an earlier knur ‘knot in wood’ and the diminutive -le, from Middle English knaur or knarre ‘knot in wood; twisted rock; crag’. This descends from Old English cnearra but the vowel in Middle English may have been influenced by Old Norse knǫrr ‘merchant ship’ which was known as cnearr in Old English. The modern gnarl is a back-formation of gnarled which itself is first attested in Shakespeare’s works and is apparently a variant of knurled.  Uses  Two examples of the use of knurling in hand tools The operation is performed for producing indentations on a part of a workpiece. Knurling allows hands or fingers to get a better grip on the knurled object than would be provided by the originally smooth metal surface. Occasionally, the knurled pattern is a series of straight ridges or a helix of \\"straight\\" ridges rather than the more-usual criss-cross pattern. Knurling may also be used as a repair method: because a rolled-in knurled surface has raised areas surrounding the depressed areas, these raised areas can make up for wear on the part. In the days when labor was cheap and parts expensive, this repair method was feasible on pistons of internal combustion engines, where the skirt of a worn piston was expanded back to the nominal size using a knurling process. As auto parts have become less expensive, knurling has become less prevalent than it once was, and is specifically discouraged by performance engine builders.Monroe, Tom. \\"Engine Rebuilder's Handbook\\". HPBooks, New York, 1996. Page 48. Knurling can also be used when a component will be assembled into a low precision component, for example a metal pin into a plastic molding. The outer surface of the metal pin is knurled so that the raised detail \\"bites\\" into the plastic irrespective of whether the size of the hole in the plastic closely matches the diameter of the pin. Tool handles, mechanical pencils, the grips of pistols, barbell bars, and the control knobs on electronic equipment are frequently knurled. Knurling is also used on the grips of dartsHow It's Made - Darts (knurling wheels at 2:50) and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Found in many surgical instruments, with use in instrument identification, and the ease of brushing clean. The knurled nut is another application, having a knurled finish instead of hexagonal or square edges to help in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The knurled surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small-diameter bolts. Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles. Aside from adding functionality to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being some of the most common), knurling also adds a decorative pattern to the material.  Process  A single wheel knurling tool A diamond knurling tool with two of the interchangeable rollers shown above it More common than knurl cutting, knurl rolling is usually accomplished using one or more very hard rollers that contain the reverse of the pattern to be imposed. It is possible for a \\"straight\\" knurl (not criss-crossed) to be pressed with a single roller, however the material needs to be supported adequately to avoid deformation. A criss-cross pattern can be accomplished using any of: * A single roller that contains the reverse of the complete desired pattern. These are available to form either \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" patterns, * A left-handed straight roller followed by a right-handed straight roller (or vice versa), or * One or more left-handed rollers used simultaneously with one or more right-handed rollers. A popular myth is that rolled knurls are somewhat more complicated to design than cut knurls because the outer diameter of the workpiece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece; in practice if the knurl is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper knurl on any diameter of work. The integer number of knurls for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom to the top of the pattern. By comparison, for cut knurls, the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece. Hand knurling tools are available. These resemble pipecutters but contain knurling wheels rather than cutting wheels. Usually, three wheels are carried by the tool: two left-handed wheels and one right-handed wheel or vice versa. Cut knurling often employs automatic feed, the tooling for cut knurling resembles that for form knurling with the exception that the knurls have sharp edges and are presented to the work at an angle allowing the sharp edges to cut the work, angled, diamond and straight knurling are all supported by cut knurling Cut-Knurling tools It is impossible to cut knurling \\"Like extremely coarse pitch threads\\" both because lathe gear trains will not support such longitudinal speeds and because reasonable cutting speeds would be impossible to achieve.

He is regarded as one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism, sometimes called \\"Neo-Mu’tazilism\\" after the medieval Islamic school of theology based on rationalism, Muʿtazila.Ahmed H. Al-Rahim (January 2006). \\"Islam and Liberty\\", Journal of Democracy 17 (1), pp. 166-169. He also wrote, among other things, \\"Treatise on the Oneness of God\\", and a commentary on the Quran. He briefly published, alongside Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, the Pan-Islamist anti-colonial journal Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa.  Biography  Muhammad Abduh was born in 1849 to a Turkish father and Egyptian mother in the Nile Delta. He also had Kurdish roots.Arthur Goldschmidt, Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt, Lynne Rienner Publishers (2000), p. 10 His family was of the Egyptian elite. His father was part of the Umad, or the local ruling elite. His mother was part of the Ashraf. He was educated in Tanta at a private school. When he turned thirteen, he was sent to the Aḥmadī mosque, which was one of the largest educational institutions in Egypt. A while later Abduh ran away from school and got married. He enrolled at al-Azhar University in 1866.Kügelgen, Anke von. \\"ʿAbduh, Muḥammad.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, v.3. Edited by: Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas and Everett Rowson. Brill, 2009. Syracuse University. 23 April 2009 Abduh studied logic, philosophy and Sufism at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo. He was a student of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani,Kedourie, E. (1997). Afghani and 'Abduh: An Essay on Religious Unbelief and Political Activism in Modern Islam, London: Frank Cass. . a philosopher and Muslim religious reformer who advocated Pan-Islamism to resist European colonialism. Under al-Afghani's influence, Abduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination in Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghani taught Abduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world and about the technological achievements of the West. In 1877, Abduh was granted the degree of 'Alim (\\"teacher\\") and he started to teach logic, theology and ethics at al-Azhar. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo's teachers' training college Dar al-Ulum, later incorporated into Cairo University. He was also appointed to teach Arabic at the Khedivial School of Languages. Abduh was appointed editor-in-chief of al-Waqāʾiʿ al- Miṣriyya, the official state newspaper. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child’s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child’s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich. In 1879, due to his political activity, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani was exiled and Abduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms. He was exiled from Egypt by the British in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist revolt led by Ahmed Orabi in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances. Abduh spent several years in Ottoman Lebanon, where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to Paris, France where he joined al-Afghani in publishing The Firmest Bond (al-Urwah al- Wuthqa), an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views. Abduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of Egypt and Sudan with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in England and Tunisia, he returned to Beirut, as a teacher, and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay there he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. When he returned to Egypt in 1888, Abduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal. In 1899, he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt, the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died. As a judge, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views endeared him to the British, in particular Lord Cromer; however they also caused a rift between him and the khedive Abbas Hilmi and the nationalist leader Mustafa Kamil. While he was in Egypt, Abduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences and worked towards reforming al-Azhar University by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum and the working conditions for both professors and students. In 1900 he founded The Society for the Revival of Arabic Literature.Brockett, Adrian Alan, Studies in two transmissions of the Qur'an, p11 He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in Cambridge and Oxford. He studied French law and read a great many European and Arab works in the libraries of Vienna and Berlin. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers. Muhammad Abduh died in Alexandria on 11 July 1905. People from all around the world sent their condolences. Thought Work of Muhammad Abduh, translated in Old Tatar language and published in tatar city Kazan in 1911 Muhammad Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics; they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.Gelvin , J. L. (2008). The Modern Middle East (2nd ed., pp. 161-162). New York: Oxford university Press. His Muslim opponents refer to him as an infidel; however, his followers called him a sage, a reviver of religion and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the epithets “al-Ustādh al-Imām” and “al- Shaykh al-Muftī”. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. Abduh does not advocate returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against polygamy if it resulted in injustice between wives. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement and abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination. Abduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between Sunnis and Shias. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as superstitions coming from popular Sufism.Benzine, Rachid. Les nouveaux penseurs de l'islam, p. 43-44. As Christianity was the second biggest religion in Egypt, he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend Copts. During the Urabi revolt, some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger against European colonialism. Abduh also had meetings in Baghdad with the son of the Baháʼí Faith's founder and then spiritual leader, Abdu'l Baha, who he had a generally positive view of - although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic religious scripture or status of Baha'ullah as a prophet in the faith and viewed it as a reformation of Shi'ism.Juan R.I. Cole. Muhammad \`Abduh and Rashid Rida: A Dialogue on the Baháʼí Faith. World Order Vol. 15, nos. 3-4 (Spring/Summer 1981):7-16. Abduh's collected works have been compiled and published in five volumes by Muhammad Imarah.  Freemasonry  At the age of 28, Abduh became a Freemason and joined a Masonic lodge, the Kawkab Al-Sharq (Planet of the East). Its members included Prince Tawfiq, the Khedive's son and heir, leading personalities such as Muhammad Sharif Pasha, who had been a minister, Sulayman Abaza Pasha and Saad Zaghlul. A. M. Broadbent declared that \\"Sheikh Abdu was no dangerous fanatic or religious enthusiast, for he belonged to the broadest school of Moslem thought, held a political creed akin to pure republicanism, and was a zealous Master of a Masonic Lodge.\\" In line with Masonic principles, Abduh sought to encourage unity with all religious traditions. He stated that, \\"I hope to see the two great religions, Islam and Christianity hand-in-hand, embracing each other. Then the Torah and the Bible and the Qur'an will become books supporting one another being read everywhere, and respected by every nation.\\" He added that he was “looking forward to seeing Muslims read the Torah and the Bible.\\"Muhammad 'Abduh, \\"Islam and Christianity,\\" in Waqf Ikhlas, The Religion Reformers in Islam, Istanbul, 1995, p. 117 'Abduh was asked why he and (his teacher) Afghani had become Masons. He replied that it was for a \\"political and social purpose\\".Rida, \\"Tatimmat,\\" p. 402. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 92, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1972), pp. 25–35  Abduh and the Baháʼí Faith  Like his teacher, Abduh was associated with the Baháʼí Faith, which had made deliberate efforts to spread the faith to Egypt, establishing themselves in Alexandria and Cairo beginning in the late 1860s. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, \`Abdu'l-Bahá would attend Abduh's study sessions. The two men met at a time when they had similar goals of religious reform and were in opposition to the Ottoman ulama. Regarding the meetings of \`Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad 'Abduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that \\"His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.\\" Remarking on \`Abdu'l-Bahá’s excellence in religious science and diplomacy, Abduh said of him that, \\"[he] is more than that. Indeed, he is a great man; he is the man who deserves to have the epithet applied to him.\\"  Works  * Comments on Peak of Eloquence *Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa Other works by Muhammad \`Abduh *(1897) Risālat al-tawḥīd (“Treatise on the oneness of God;” first edition) *(1903) Tafsir Surat al-\`Asr, Cairo. *(1904) Tafsir juz’ \`Amma, al-Matb. al-Amiriyya, Cairo. *(1927) Tafsir Manar, 12 volumes *(1944) Muhammad Abduh. \\"Essai sur ses idées philosophiques et religieuses\\", Cairo *(1954-1961), Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Hakim al-Mustahir bi Tafsir al-Manar, 12 vols. with indices, Cairo. *(1962 or 1963) (Islamic year 1382), Fatihat al-Kitab, Tafsir al-Ustadh al-Imam…, Kitab al- Tahrir, Cairo. *(no date), Durus min al-Qur'an al-Karim, ed. by Tahir al- Tanakhi, Dar al-Hilal, Cairo. *(1966) The Theology of Unity, trans. by Ishaq Musa'ad and Kenneth Cragg.

Ridenour held this post since the organization's founding in 1982 until her death. She wrote a syndicated op-ed column from 1997 and was a frequent radio and television guest. Background According to Nina Easton's Gang of Five, Amy Moritz was a veteran organizer of the College Republican National Committee. She was a candidate in 1981 for election as national chairman of the organization, opposed by Jack Abramoff. Abramoff, Ralph Reed, and Grover Norquist persuaded Moritz to drop out of the race by promising her the appointed position of executive director. With the only serious competitor out of the way, Abramoff won the election easily. Although Moritz was later rebuffed by the \\"Abramoff-Norquist-Reed triumvirate\\" and only given the titular position of \\"deputy director\\", she continued to work with the group and became a good friend of Norquist. Abramoff would also later become a director of the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Moritz later married fellow College Republican David A. Ridenour. National Center for Public Policy Research Ridenour was a founding chief executive officer of the NCPPR in 1982. The NCPPR claims to promote \\"the conservative and free market perspective on US domestic, foreign and defense policy issues.\\" Ridenour's husband David A. Ridenour is vice president of the organization. NCPPR bulletins have been heavily cited by conservative members of Congress, sometimes apparently being copied entirely with little more than a change in letterhead. An example from House member Richard Pombo: *\\"Earth Day 2002 Fact Sheet Myths and Facts About the Environment\\" from NCPPA *\\"Earth Day 2002 Myths & Facts\\" from Richard Pombo . Pro-tobacco, anti- environmental positions During the national tobacco litigation, a memo from Philip Morris executive Frank Gomez revealed that Ridenour (under her maiden name of Amy Moritz) had offered \\"to use any information we can provide re the current anti-tobacco onslaught...\\" Ridenour wrote many op-eds attacking the filing of lawsuits by state attorneys general against tobacco firms and on tobacco policies, such as \\"Ironies of the Tobacco Wars,\\" \\"Federal Tobacco Lawsuit Could Pave Way for Litigation Tax on Other Industries,\\" \\"Latin America Go Home: Tobacco Policies in Foreign Countries Should Be Made by Foreign Countries, Not in U.S. Courts\\" and \\"Lawyers' Fees in Tobacco Case Should Be Capped.\\" Ridenour said that such lawsuits were improper, that regulation of tobacco was the province of legislatures, not law enforcement, and that private attorneys were using the suits to enrich themselves by many millions of dollars. Environmentalists also claimed articles by Ridenour skeptical of the global warming theory were written only because NCPPR received support from ExxonMobil. Ridenour, writing on her blog, countered that her writing on the issue began in 1992, predating by many years her institution's receipt of any funding from fossil fuel industries. She also claimed that total fossil fuel funding of NCPPR in 2004 amounted to six-tenths of one percent of her organization's total funding. An examination of ExxonMobil grant reports in 2011 on the ExxonMobil website showed NCPPR had not received any grants from ExxonMobil for at least several years. Abramoff connections =Support for Abramoff clients= In a series of editorials between 1999 and 2001, Ridenour attacked efforts to expand federal immigration laws to the Commonwealth of the Marianas Islands, defended the islands' meager wages, and attacked Clinton Administration attempts to tighten labor laws. Ridenour also lent her support to the Western Pacific Economic Council, a trade group composed of Marianas garment manufacturers. Her group’s name appeared in a Saipan newspaper backing the Council in 1999. Both the Marianas and the Economic Council were clients of Jack Abramoff at the time. The Marianas paid Abramoff’s firm Preston Gates $1.9 million in 1999 and 2000 and his second firm, Greenberg Traurig, $1.1 million in 2001. The Western Pacific Economic Council paid Preston Gates $2.3 million in 1999 and 2000. In August 2001, Ridenour wrote an editorial in the Washington Times, \\"The U.S. Must Tread Carefully to Avoid Creating More Fundamentalist Islamic Governments,\\" warning of the dangerous possibility that Malaysia could become a third Iran or Afghanistan, with what she called \\"ferocious and fanatical hatred aimed against the West generally and the United States in particular\\" and in the case of Afghanistan sheltering \\"the world's most notorious - and dangerous - international terrorist, Osama bin Laden.\\" She warned about Islamic fundamentalist support for Anwar Ibrahim, the main political rival of Abramoff’s then-client, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed. Of Malaysia, she wrote, \\"in recent years Malaysia has made extraordinary strides in its development as a prosperous, stable and democratic state\\" but \\"its levels of economic freedom, regulations on trade and limits on private property rights led the Heritage Foundation to conclude in 2001 that its economy is 'mostly unfree.'\\" Abramoff was paid $1.2 million to arrange a meeting between the Prime Minister and President Bush. =Funding of Abramoff-sponsored trips= Ridenour has come under fire for allegedly using the NCPPR as a clearinghouse for clients of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff to pay for a luxurious golf trip to St. Andrew's in Scotland, attended by congressman Tom DeLay and others. Ridenour was called to testify on this matter before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on June 22, 2005. Records showed that Abramoff directed one of his clients to donate to the NCPPR; the NCPPR then paid an equivalent amount to provide most of the funding for the golf trip, which was described in required House filing paperwork as for \\"educational purposes\\". Two months after the trip, DeLay voted against legislation opposed by the client. DeLay and Ridenour have both defended the propriety of the arrangement, asserting that the donation was in no way connected to the trip, nor were the donation or the trip connected to the vote. DeLay was admonished three times last year by the House ethics committee for infringing rules governing lawmakers' activities and their contacts with registered lobbyists. House ethics rules bar the payment by lobbyists for any lawmaker's travel-connected entertainment and recreational activities costing more than $50; they also require that lawmakers accurately report the sponsor of their trips and the full cost. In an article last month about the same trip by DeLay, The Post reported that an Indian tribe and a gambling services company made donations to the National Center for Public Policy Research that covered most of the expenses declared by participants at that time. The article also said these payments were made two months before DeLay voted against legislation opposed by the tribe and the company. DeLay has said the vote was unrelated to the payments. The article also reported that Abramoff submitted an expense voucher to Preston Gates seeking a reimbursement of $12,789.73 to cover expenses for meals, hotels and transportation during the London and Scotland trip incurred by DeLay; his wife, Christine; and his two aides. The new receipts add more detail about these expenses, make clear that the total expenses for all of the participants were at least $50,000 more than was previously known, and connect Abramoff directly to the payment of some charges.\\"DeLay Airfare Was Charged To Lobbyist's Credit Card\\", The Washington Post, April 24, 2005. Ridenour also attended the 1997 DeLay-Abramoff trip to Russia funded through NCPPR by the Russian energy giant Naftasib.\\"A 3rd DeLay Trip Under Scrutiny\\", The Washington Post, April 6, 2005.

The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (which translates as 'god-born devil-dung'),\\"The full name, Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, God-born Devil's Dung, indicates the combination in one person of the half malicious Swiftian satire with the ethereal idealism of a Fichte or a Goethe. Carlyle calls attention to this twofold nature of his hero in numerous places. In the chapter on Reminiscences the editor remembers seeing in his eyes 'gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire'; in the chapter on Characteristics we are told that his voice screws itself aloft 'as into the song of spirits, or else the shrill mockery of fiends,' that at times we distinguish 'gleams of an ethereal love, 'soft wailings of infinite pity,' and at others \\"some half invisible wrinkle of a bitter sardonic humor\\" so that 'you look on him almost with a shudder, as on some incarnate Mephistopheles.' His eyes again are described as sparkling with lights, which 'may indeed be reflexes of the heavenly stars, but perhaps also gleams from the region of Nether Fire'.\\" — Johnson, William Savage (1911). \\"Sartor Resartus.\\" In: Thomas Carlyle: A Study of his Literary Apprenticeship, 1814-1831. New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 113–114. author of a tome entitled Clothes: Their Origin and Influence, but is actually a poioumenon.Fowler, Alastair. The History of English Literature, p. 372 Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA (1989) Teufelsdröckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a sceptical English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German Idealism more generally. However, Teufelsdröckh is also a literary device with which Carlyle can express difficult truths. Background Archibald MacMechan surmised that the novel's invention had three literary sources. The first of these was A Tale of a Tub by Jonathan Swift, whom Carlyle intensely admired in his college years, even going by the nicknames \\"Jonathan\\" and \\"The Dean\\". In that work, the three main traditions of Western Christianity are represented by a father bestowing his three children with clothes they may never alter, but proceed to do so according to fashion. Carlyle's second influence, according to MacMechan, was his own work in translating Goethe, particularly Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and Faust, all of which Carlyle quotes and explicitly refers to, especially when Teufelsdröckh's names his own crisis \\"The Sorrows of Young Teufelsdröckh.\\" The third major influence was Tristram Shandy from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and he referred to earlier in his letters.\\"My first favourite books had been Hudibras and Tristram Shandy.\\" qtd in Craigenputtock House Carlyle worked on an earlier novel, Wotton Reinfred which Macmechan refers to as \\"[t]he first draft of Sartor.\\" Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert, who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses speculative philosophy with him. At this point, the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around Kant. Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle's wife Jane, Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle's death. MacMechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle's frustration and scorn due to the \\"zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction\\" he speaks of in his letters of the time. Numerous parts of Wotton appear in the biographical section of Sartor Resartus, in which Carlyle humorously sentences them to the bags containing Teufelsdröckh's autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains are overly fragmented or derivative of Goethe. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form; several passages were moved verbatim to Sartor Resartus, but with their context radically changed. Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel, and he began composing it as an article in October 1831 at Craigenputtock.Fred Kaplan, \\"Carlyle, Thomas (1795–1881)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., 2008, accessed 10 Jan 2011. Fraser's Magazine serialised it in 1833–1834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson's savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation, which the novel did not attain in Britain. The first British edition would be published in London in 1838.Campbell, Ian. \\"Thomas Carlyle\\". Victorian Prose Writers Before 1867. Ed. William B. Thesing. Detroit: Gale Research, 1987. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 55. Literature Resource Center. Web. 10 Jan. 2011. Plot The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English Publication Fraser's Magazine (in which the novel was first serialized without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is, upon request, reviewing the fictional German book Clothes, Their Origin and Influence by the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (Professor of \\"Things in General\\" at Weissnichtwo \\"Know not where\\" University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing as well, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdröckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book's philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests back to Teufelsdröckh's office in Germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdröckh's book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor's many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations from Goethe and Shakespeare. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor's frustration at the philosophy, and his desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received word from Teufelsdröckh's office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organized into bags based on the signs of the Latin Zodiac) on which are written autobiographical fragments. Room in which Sartor Resartus was written. At the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organized the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdröckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl (\\"Duck-Pond\\"); his father a retired Sergeant of Frederick the Great and his mother a very pious woman, who to Teufelsdröckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdröckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdröckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (slap-behind) Gymnasium. While there, Teufelsdröckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent: glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character, as regarding both his own treatment and his education's application to politics. While at University, Teufelsdröckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post and some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdröckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (Goddess of Flowers; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdröckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, and leaves the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated Everlasting No, disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdröckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a \\"Centre of Indifference\\", and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in \\"The Everlasting Yes\\". The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdröckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy. =Characters= Diogenes Teufelsdröckh: (Greek/German:\\"God-Born Devil-Dung\\") The Professor of \\"Things in General\\" at Weissnichtwo University, and writer of a long book of German idealist philosophy called \\"Clothes, Their Origin and Influence,\\" the review of which forms the contents of the novel. Both professor and book are fictional. The Editor: The narrator of the novel, who in reviewing Teufelsdröckh's book, reveals much about his own tastes, as well as deep sympathy towards Teufelsdröckh, and much worry as to social issues of his day. His tone varies between conversational, condemning and even semi-Biblical prophecy. The Reviewer should not be confused with Carlyle himself, seeing as much of Teufelsdröckh's life implements Carlyle's own biography. Hofrath: Hofrath Heuschrecke (i. e. State-Councillor Grasshopper) is a loose, zigzag figure, a blind admirer of Teufelsdröckh's, an incarnation of distraction distracted, and the only one who advises the editor and encourages him in his work; a victim to timidity and preyed on by an uncomfortable sense of mere physical cold, such as the majority of the state- counsellors of the day were. Blumine: A woman associated to the German nobility with whom Teufelsdröckh falls in love early in his career. Her spurning of him to marry Towgood leads Teufelsdröckh to the spiritual crisis that culminates in the Everlasting No. Their relationship is somewhat parodic of Werther's spurned love for Lotte in The Sorrows of Young Werther (including her name \\"Goddess of Flowers\\", which may simply be a pseudonym), though, as the Editor notes, Teufelsdröckh does not take as much incentive as does Werther. Critics have associated her with Kitty Kirkpatrick, with whom Carlyle himself fell in love before marrying Jane Carlyle.Heffer, Simon (1995). Moral Desperado – A Life of Thomas Carlyle. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 48. \\"East Did Meet West – 3,\\" by Dr. Rizwana Rahim. Towgood: The English Aristocrat who ultimately marries Blumine, throwing Teufelsdröckh into a spiritual crisis. If Blumine is indeed a fictionalization of Kitty Kirkpatrick, Towgood would find his original in Captain James Winslowe Phillipps, who married Kirkpatrick in 1829. =Locales= Dumdrudge: Dumdrudge is an imaginary village where the natives drudge away and say nothing about it, as villagers all over the world contentedly do. 'Weissnichtwo:' In the book, Weissnichtwo (weiß-nicht-wo, German for \\"don't-know-where\\") is an imaginary European city, viewed as the focus, and as exhibiting the operation, of all the influences for good and evil of the time, described in terms which characterised city life in the first quarter of the 19th Century; so universal appeared the spiritual forces at work in society at that time that it was impossible to say where they were and where they were not, and hence the name of the city, \\"Don't-know-where\\" (cf. Sir Walter Scott's Kennaquhair). Themes and critical reception Sartor Resartus was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where \\"truth\\" is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier in Tristram Shandy, to which it refers. The imaginary \\"Philosophy of Clothes\\" holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over time, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith- systems. The book contains a very Fichtean conception of religious conversion: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to see Sartor Resartus as an early existentialist text. One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as Teufelsdröckh's publisher being named Stillschweigen and Co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdröckh's father is introduced as an earnest believer in Walter Shandy's doctrine that \\"there is much, nay almost all in Names.\\" According to Rodger L. Tarr, \\"The influence of Sartor Resartus upon American Literature is so vast, so pervasive, that it is difficult to overstate.\\" Upon learning of Carlyle's death in 1881 Walt Whitman remarked: 'The way to test how much he has left us all were to consider, or try to consider, for the moment the array of British thought, the resultant and ensemble of the last fifty years, as existing to-day, but with Carlyle left out. It would be like an army with no artillery.'\\" Tarr suggests the influence of Sartor Resartus on American writers including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Margaret Fuller, Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain. Both Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, however, read and objected to the book. Jorge Luis Borges greatly admired the book, recounting that in 1916 at age 17 \\"[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.\\"Jorge Luis Borges, This Craft of Verse, Harvard University Press, 2000. pp. 104. Word Music and Translation, Lecture, Delivered February 28, 1968. Many of Borges' first characteristic and most admired works employ the same technique of intentional pseudepigraphy as Carlyle, such as \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\" and \\"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\".

Early life and education Strong was born in Portland, Oregon. He initially studied zoology, but he changed his focus to anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, under the influence of Alfred L. Kroeber, who became his \\"principal teacher, mentor, and friend\\". Strong completed his doctorate in 1926. Career Strong's doctoral dissertation, \\"An Analysis of Southwestern Society\\", was published in American Anthropologist. A related study of his, Aboriginal Society in Southern California, presenting his detailed fieldwork among the Serrano, Luiseño, Cupeño, and Cahuilla peoples, has been characterized as \\"one of the earliest and one of the best efforts by a United States anthropologist to combine structural-functional analysis with historical data and interpretation\\". Strong also conducted ethnographic field research among the Naskapi of Labrador. Most of Strong's anthropological contributions were specifically in archaeology. His 1935 study, \\"An Introduction to Nebraska Archaeology\\", is credited with providing a major impetus for the direct historical approach in archaeology. In the 1930s, Strong, Waldo Rudolph Wedel and A. T. Hill found archaeological evidence in Nebraska different from the prehistoric Central Plains and Woodland traditions. The evidence was attributed to a new culture called the Dismal River culture, or Dismal River aspect, for its location on the Dismal River basin of Nebraska, dated between 1650-1750. Strong performed pioneering fieldwork in California's San Joaquin Valley, the Pacific Northwest, the American Great Plains, Labrador, and Honduras, where he sought the legendary La Ciudad Blanca. In Peru, he developed statistical methods to seriate pottery styles and is credited with the discovery of the tomb of the war god Ai apaec in 1946. Strong held academic positions at the University of Nebraska and Columbia University. Among his notable students were the archaeologists Waldo Wedel and Gordon Willey.

W. Abel, was an American labor leader. Early life and career Abel was born in Magnolia, Ohio, in 1908, to John Franklin Abel, a German blacksmith, and Mary Ann (née Jones) Abel, the daughter of a Welsh coal miner. He attended local public school and graduated from Magnolia High School in 1925. He attended college at Canton Actual Business College in Canton, Ohio, but he did not graduate. In 1925, he worked as a molder for the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company (now U.S. Steel) in Canton. He switched jobs often and found employment at the Canton Malleable Iron Company, the Timken Roller Bearing Company and the Colonial Foundry. Abel married Bernice Joseph in 1930. The couple had two children. She died in 1982, and Abel married Martha Turvey a few years later. Laid off during the Great Depression, Abel worked at a brickmaking company loading a kiln at less than a quarter his former pay. Convinced that a union would have protected him from losing his job, he became active in the American labor movement. Union career In 1936, Abel found work again at Timken Roller Bearing and, with the assistance of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), he organized Steel Workers Local 1123. He remained a member of the local until his death. He proved an effective and strong negotiator and union president, and in one year alone, he led 42 wildcat strikes. Abel was an active participant in the Little Steel Strike in 1937. His skilled leadership during the strike brought him to the attention of national SWOC officers and staff. In 1937, Abel was hired by SWOC head the national union's organizing staff. Abel became a protégé of Philip Murray, president of SWOC. When SWOC merged with the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers in 1942, to form the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), Abel was appointed director of the Canton District of the USWA and became a member of the executive council of the Ohio CIO Council. During World War II, Abel served on the National War Labor Board, representing the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). =Challenging McDonald= Murray died in 1952. USWA secretary-treasurer David J. McDonald was elected president as his successor, and Abel was elected secretary-treasurer. Unlike the flamboyant and vocal McDonald, Abel remained in the background as the union's secretary- treasurer. He was appointed to the CIO-PAC, the CIO's political action committee. He spent most of his time visiting local unions and listening to members. In the early 1960s, Abel was angered by what he perceived as McDonald's weakness in winning new national contracts for steelworkers. When McDonald altered the union's constitution to permit him to serve two more four-year terms, Abel decided to challenge McDonald in the 1965 presidential election. Abel accused McDonald of being too cozy with employers by substituting fringe benefit gains for wage increases and ignoring members' concerns. The election took place on February 9, 1965. Voting irregularities and challenged ballots delayed a final result until April 30. Abel relied heavily on voting and ballot-challenging procedures established under the relatively new Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (or \\"Landrum- Griffin Act\\"). Without the assistance of the new law, it is unclear that he would have won. However, union officials and federal monitors eventually declared Abel the winner by a razor-thin margin of 10,142 votes, out of 600,678 cast, and on May 20, McDonald declined to challenge the result. Over 7,000 of the votes came from Canadian locals, and Abel spent a greater amount of time than had any of his predecessors protecting the interests of Canadian steelworkers locals. Abel was sworn in as USWA president on June 2, 1965. =President of USWA= Abel was elected a vice president of the AFL-CIO following his election and served on the federation's executive council. In 1968, he was elected president of the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO. During Abel's presidency, membership in the USWA rose by more than 500,000, as he engineered mergers with the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers in 1967; the United Stone and Allied Product Workers of America in 1971; and District 50 of the Allied and Technical Workers of America in 1972. Abel also broadened the union's inclusiveness. He encouraged open discussion of controversial issues among the staff and membership and decentralized a number of union functions. He also worked to increase minority participation in local, regional and national union affairs and to end job discrimination by local steelworker unions. His reforms were not enough. Workers sued the union for race and sex discrimination numerous times in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, Abel was forced to sign a consent decree to alter seniority rules that discriminated against women and minority workers. Abel actively sought new federal laws to protect union workers as well. He was a vigorous proponent of workplace health and safety and worked to help pass the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970. He was also a strong advocate of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which protected the interests of participants in private pension plans and established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Abel also won several strong national steel and other metals contracts. He established the union's first strike fund and quickly amassed an $85 million balance. He resumed coordinated bargaining with the major steelmakers and established separate bargaining councils for aluminum and other metals industries. In 1971, record imports of foreign steel led to 108,000 steelworkers being laid off. Although a new national steel contract was reached without a strike the same year, Abel and the USWA executive council realized that the steel industry's tendency to stockpile steel in anticipation of a strike led to a boom-and-bust cycle, which hurt workers. To counteract the cycle, in 1973 Abel negotiated the Experimental Negotiating Agreement (ENA) with the major steelmakers. Abel agreed not to strike during the 1974 contract talks and agreed to binding arbitration for any bargaining issues that led to impasse. The ENA proved a great success during the 1974 national steel contract talks. Abel won a $2.00 an hour raise over three years. The union also won the right to engage in local strikes over noneconomic working conditions, which the union had agreed to ban in previous contracts. The ENA contributed to a second round of successful contract talks in 1977, but employers unilaterally withdrew from the pact in 1980 after the steel industry recession of 1979. On January 11, 1977, Abel was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford. =Other roles= In 1967, he was appointed an alternate representative of the US delegation to the United Nations. Abel's strong advocacy of the rights of minorities within the union led him to be appointed a member of the Kerner Commission in 1968, which investigated the 1967 race riots. In 1971, Abel was appointed to the Economic Stabilization Program, President Richard Nixon's wage and price restraint board. He resigned in 1972 over the program's decision for strict limits to wage increases for workers. =Internal opposition= Various union leaders and members began to criticize Abel after the 1977 contract. Despite Abel's successes at the bargaining table, steelmakers continued to cut back production, and union membership sank by 650,000. Also, older union members were angry over the 1974 consent decree, which had stripped them of their seniority. One Abel's most prominent critics was Edward Sadlowski, the director of District 31, then the union's largest district. Sadlowski, a member of the union's Rank and File Caucus, had mounted an insurgent campaign for the post of director of District 31 in 1973. Although he was unsuccessful, he sued to have the election overturned on the grounds that it violated the fair election procedures of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. The election was rerun, with Sadlowski winning in 1974. Sadlowski was widely considered to be a challenger to Abel in the 1977 presidential election. =Retirement= However, Abel had announced his retirement instead. An Abel protégé, Lloyd McBride, the director of District 34, ran as Abel's successor. Sadlowski ran for the presidency. Abel spent a significant amount of time campaigning for McBride. The election was a bitter one, but McBride won. After his retirement, Abel moved to Sun City, Arizona. In 1984, he and his new wife moved to Malvern, Ohio. Death Abel died of cancer at his home in Malvern in 1987; he would have turned 79 one day later. References Sources *\\"Abel Is Sworn In By Steelworkers.\\" New York Times.

The plants grow close to the ground with leaves formed around each other in a rosette, and propagating by offsets. The \\"hen\\" is the main, or mother, plant, and the \\"chicks\\" are a flock of offspring,https://www.yakimaherald.com/magazine/home_and_garden/master- gardener-sedums-succulents/article_71fa3d98-4197-11e8-8134-1f6fef7ee414.html which start as tiny buds on the main plant and soon sprout their own roots, taking up residence close to the mother plant. Plants commonly referred to as \\"Hens and chicks\\" include ground-hugging species of Sempervivum (houseleeks) such as Sempervivum 'Pekinese', S. arachnoideum (cobweb houseleek), and S. tectorum (common houseleek), as well as members of the related genus Jovibarba. The name is also used for some species of Echeveria, Sedum and Bergenia although these plants differ significantly from Sempervivum and Jovibarba, and may require different cultivation and care. Care Hen and chicks is popular in gardens for its varied and interesting appearance and hardiness. It is grown as container planting or in rock gardens. It does best in well-drained, rocky soil; if they are kept wet, the outer leaves will rot. Planting them in cactus or succulent soil will prevent your plant from sitting in water and meeting an untimely end. Commercial succulent soil is a good choice. Although it does best in sun, it will grow in light shade.

John Abel was born in Sarnesfield, Herefordshire. He was a Catholic recusant, along with his wife Johanna. In 1618 he was brought before a church court to answer for his recusancy and also for his secret marriage to Johanna. The case against him was eventually dismissed, but his name can be found on a list of Catholic recusants from 1640. Abel married twice, but there is no record of his second wife except on his table tomb in Sarnesfield. He had one son, named John, who later became churchwarden of Sarnesfield. Work Very little is known about Abel's work, and some local traditions attribute buildings to him that are impossible in terms of their date. Abel's first known commission was in 1625 when he was contracted to build Lady Hawkins' grammar school in Kington. The contract was to fit into the terms of the will of Lady Margaret Hawkins. It is known that Abel supplied all the materials and that he was paid £240. The house design differs significantly from his later work in that it was built partially of stone. The stone window and ceiling beams of the house still survive, though the rest of the building was demolished. In March 1633, it is known that Abel was contracted again, this time by John, 1st Viscount Scudamore, to renovate Abbey Dore Church, a former Cistercian monastery in Herefordshire.Colvin, \\"The restoration of Abbey Dore Church in 1633-34\\", Transactions of theWoolthorpe Naturalists' Field Club32 1948:235-37 The work was completed in March 1634, in time for the reconsecration of the building. Though there have been some minor alterations made to his work, the church remains the most intact example of Abel's work available today as well as one of the best preserved examples of Laudian architecture. There is no record of Abel's work for another eighteen years, until in 1652, he was contracted to create a new building for which he was paid £30. 'The modell of ye New Building' still exists and is currently kept at Tyberton Court, where the work was originally done. Abel is also known to have built market houses in Brecnoc (1624), Kington and Lemster (1634). The Lemster (now Leominster) market house originally stood in Broad Street, but was rebuilt in 1855 by John Arkwright who bought the building for £95. He offered the building to the council if they would re-erect it but they refused. He moved the building himself and rebuilt it in 1856. It remained as a private house until the 1930s. It now stands next to the priory church and is currently used as council offices. It is widely regarded as one of Abel's finest works and is built in the Renaissance tradition. It is now known as Grange Court. In 2001, a campaign was started to raise money to restore the building to its original state. The building is Grade II listed. The Kington market hall was demolished in 1820 and no record of its appearance remains. All of Abel's market houses are known to have been built in timber and were known to contain lengthy religious inscriptions in their walls, some borrowing from both St Jerome and Cato the Elder. Some of these inscriptions can also be found on his work at Dore Abbey. In spite of the intricacies of his work, Abel's style has still been described as 'restrained'. Based on the consistency of Abel's style, scholars tentatively attribute the restoration of Vowchurch in 1613 and Monnington Court on the Wye to him. =Military work= In 1645, during the middle of the civil war, Abel was in Hereford when the Scots besieged it. With Charles I and his soldiers inside the city walls, mills were important to ensure the food supply lasted, and powder mills to make gunpowder. The Roundheads had burnt down the mills the town had previously owned. However, Abel was able to design and build another one. Records differ but because of this the King granted Abel the title of either Master Carpenter or the King's Carpenter. Sir Barnabus Scudamore went further in his estimation of Abel, saying that he was the only man in England who was able to create powder mills. Abel is also known to have created a wooden tank called the Sow which Scudmore deployed against the parliamentary garrison at Canon Frome in October 1645. Unfortunately the device was never used in combat as it was surprised by Parliamentarian raiders. Myths Abel is frequently connected to the Hereford Market Hall (which was partially demolished in 1862), though historical evidence suggests that the building was not created by him. In 2008, English Heritage's Inspector of Historic Buildings, Nick Molyneux, was noted as saying that the style of the architecture was different from Abel's. Though historical records clearly show otherwise, legend states that Abel found, felled and used all the timber used in Dore Abbey Church in less than five months. In spite of a lack of evidence that he had a hand in the architecture, John Abel was associated with buildings in: Weobley, Abbey Dore, Tyberton, Stretford, Orleton, Pembridge, Ross-on-Wye, Ledbury and Hereford. Death Abel died in January 1675 and was buried at Sarnesfield on 31 January. He was 97 years old. He wrote his own epitaph and built his own tomb. His tombstone read: In the Victorian era, the tomb was restored by the National Society for Preserving the Memorials of the Dead and the epitaph was slightly altered. In 2001 a campaign was started to restore Abel's tomb.

He established the pharmacology department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1893, and then became America's first full- time professor of pharmacology. During his time at Hopkins, he made several important medical advancements, especially in the field of hormone extraction. In addition to his laboratory work, he founded several significant scientific journals such as the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Early life and education John Jacob Abel was born in 1857 to George M. and Mary (Becker) Abel near Cleveland, Ohio. He earned his Ph.B. (Bachelor of Philosophy) from the University of Michigan where he studied with Henry Sewall in 1883. But, during this time he took several years off to serve as a principal of the high school in La Porte, Indiana. There he taught many subjects ranging from chemistry and physics to Latin. He then went to Johns Hopkins University, where he studied under Henry Newell Martin, a cardiac physiologist and professor of biology. He then left for Europe, starting in Leipzig studying medical sciences, then traveling to Strasbourg where he was about to receive his Ph.D., but instead decided to receive an M.D. in 1888 from the University of Strasbourg. After his doctorate, Abel worked mostly in clinical studies and took clinical courses, focusing on biochemistry and pharmacology. He traveled around Europe, mostly in Germany and central Europe, conducting research in biochemistry. During this time, Abel had a number of mentors that inspired his work and exposed him to a number of disciplines that eventually prompted him to work in biochemistry and pharmacology. Starting in 1884, Abel worked with doctors Ludwig von Frey in physiology and histology, Rudolf Boehm in pharmacology, Adolph Strümpell in pathology, and Johannes Wislicenus in organic and inorganic chemistry. All of this work was done in Leipzig until 1886, until Abel moved on to Strasbourg, where he again worked in various fields: internal medicine with Adolph Kussmaul, and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in infectious disease and pathology. Eventually, Abel moved back to Strasbourg where he worked more with Oswald Schmiedeberg among others. Schmeidberg, however, sparked his interest in pharmacological research. Lastly, he worked in a biochemical laboratory in Berne, where he met one Arthur Robertson Cushny, who eventually worked with him at Michigan. Career Finishing his time in Europe, Abel returned to the University of Michigan as the chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics. There, he played an important role in developing the first pharmacology department in North America. He only was at the University of Michigan until 1893, when William Osler of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine asked Abel to come to the school and accept a Professorship of Pharmacology. At Johns Hopkins, Abel was the chair of pharmacology and biological chemistry, until the departments split in 1908, when Abel became the chair solely of the Department of Pharmacology. At Johns Hopkins, Abel performed his most groundbreaking research and held the position of chair of the department until he retired at the age of 75 in 1932. = Isolation of epinephrine = Ever since his early years in Europe, Abel showed great interest in isolating pure form of internal gland hormones. The first work that led to his international reputation as a pharmacologist and biochemist was the isolation of epinephrine from adrenal medulla. However, he was only able to isolate a monobenzoyl derivative of epinephrine. While he was improving his processes on decomposing the benzoyl derivative to obtain salts of epinephrine using saponification, a Japanese chemist J. Takamine, who had visited his lab, was able to successfully isolate the neutral base of epinephrine by adding ammonium to highly concentrated extract, a method Abel himself tried but failed due to the use of low concentration of extract. After Takamine's success, Abel himself remarked, with great candor, \\"The efforts of years on my part in this once mysterious field of suprarenal, medullary biochemistry, marred by blunders as they were, eventuated, then, in the isolation of the hormone not in the form of the free base but in that of its monobenzoyl derivative.\\" Macnider, WM. National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir of John Jacob Abel. The National Academies Press. pp. 11, 16, 17. = Devising early form of dialysis machine = Together with L.G. Rowntree and B.B. Turner, Abel devised what they called a \\"vividiffusion\\" apparatus, consisting of a series of tubes surrounded by fluid. They first demonstrated the apparatus at the Physiological Congress in Groningen in 1914. By allowing arterial blood to enter at one end of the connection, and later return to circulation through the venous connection after dialysis, they were able to demonstrate the existence of free amino acids in blood. By isolating these amino acids from blood circulation, Abel conducted various subsequent researches on the structure of proteins in the blood. Not only did Abel use the apparatus for his research work, he also realized the great clinical potential such dialysis machine would have on managing the damaging effects of renal failure.\\"\\"Abel, John Jacob.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography.\\". Encyclopedia.com. The vividiffusion apparatus Abel devised is the precursor to the modern day dialysis machine. He summarized his work in a paper published in 1913, \\"On the Removal of Diffusable Substances from the Circulating Blood by Means of Dialysis\\" by Transfusion Science. = Crystallization of insulin = 296x296px Abel's work on insulin started with an invitation from his old friend Arthur A. Noyes at California Institute of Technology. Noyes had just received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation for research on insulin, and he thought that Abel would be the right person to lead that research. After some preliminary experiments on the subject, Abel decided to take on the research, and replied to his friend, \\"Will attack insulin. Writing. J. J. Abel.\\"Jane H. Murnaghan, Paul Talalay. John Jacob Abel and the Crystallization of Insulin, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 10, Number 3, pp. 340, 343, 345, 346, 368, 369. Johns Hopkins University Press. Abel invested the next few years on purifying insulin. While he was trying various means to purify insulin, he had the idea to measure sulfur content of his extracts and found that the higher the sulfur content, the greater the activity. The discovery not only significantly precipitated progress on extracting active fractions but also offered the very first concrete information on the structure of insulin—sulfur is an integral part of insulin molecules. Continuing with his research on extracting insulin, on November 1925, Abel finally was able to witness one of the most beautiful sights of his life, \\"glistening crystals of insulin forming on the sides of a test tube\\". While at the California Institute of Technology, Abel completed an article in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences entitled \\"Crystalline Insulin\\" in 1926. Although Abel's work received great compliments from the media and the science community, some doubted the purity of his crystals as preliminary tests revealed that they were in fact proteins. The test result was contrary to the dominant view at the time on proteins—proteins were considered as unlikely to have such highly specific physiological activity shown by a hormone such as insulin. In 1927, he was published in the journal Science for this work with a paper entitled \\"Chemistry in Relation to Biology and Medicine with Especial Reference to Insulin and Other Hormones\\". At the time, Abel's laboratory was no doubt the center of insulin research in the United States. A lot of young scientists came to his lab and worked under Abel to study the newly crystallized hormone. Abel himself gradually withdrew from the actual experimental work on insulin after the first four years, but he continued to guide the scientists in his lab to unravel more and more about the structure of insulin molecule. = Founding scientific journals = Despite his great dedication to experimentation work, Abel's historical significance is certainly not restricted to his research work. He was also the founder of a number of influential scientific journals. As more and more research was conducted in the field of biochemistry, Abel realized the importance of having a platform that allowed scientists all around the world to publish their work and report on their findings. He therefore asked his friend Dr. C. A. Herter, Professor of Pharmacology at Columbia University, for help on founding a scientific journal on biochemistry. Together as joint editors, Abel and Herter established the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The first issue of the journal appeared in 1905. Motivated by the very same goal of trying to create an outlet for a wide dissemination of new scientific findings, he later founded the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in 1908. = Publications = * Abel JJ, Rowntree LG, Turner BB.

Although his music is more death metal than doom metal, he is one of the first musicians that blended the two styles. He played drums on the Death debut album, Scream Bloody Gore. Since he parted ways with Chuck Schuldiner in 1987 after Schuldiner moved back to Florida, Reifert decided to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in 1987 he formed his own band, Autopsy. In this band, he played not only drums but handled the vocals as well. After several albums, Autopsy split up in 1995 and Reifert and bandmate Danny Coralles began playing in their side-project, Abscess, full- time. After Abscess dissolved in 2010, Autopsy reformed and is currently planning to tour and record new material. Chris Reifert is also known for his many side-projects, including the Ravenous, Doomed, Eat My Fuk, and Violation Wound. He has also performed guest vocals on Machetazo's Sinfonias del Terror Ciego and the Autopsy-inspired Murder Squad's Ravenous, Murderous, with further guest appearances for Immortal Fate, Nuclear Death, and \\"Cathedral of the Damned\\" on Cathedral's final album, The Last Spire. He is also known for his album cover art. His interviews are noted for his sharp wit and off-the- wall humor.

Together with Louis Dollo, he was the founder of \\"paleobiology\\" and studied the life and environment of fossilized organisms.  Life  Abel was born in Vienna, the son of the architect Lothar Abel. Abel earned a PhD, after studying both law and science, from the University of Vienna. He remained there as an assistant to Alpine geologist Eduard Suess, before being appointed a professor of paleontology. Three years later, he finished his habilitation thesis as a paleontologist at the University of Vienna. From 1900 to 1907, he worked at the Geologische Reichsanstalt. In 1907, Abel became an extraordinary professor in Vienna, and from 1917 to 1934 he was a regular professor of paleontology in Vienna. As such, he led several expeditions that gave him broad recognition, such as the Pikermi-expedition to Greece in 1912, an American expedition (1925) and one to South Africa (1929). Abel became a member of the Leopoldina academy in 1935. From 1935 to 1940, he was a professor at Göttingen University, after which he was retired, age 61. In 1942, he was appointed an honorary member of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft.  Scientific activity  Abel mainly studied fossil vertebrates. He was a supporter of Neo-Lamarckist evolution. His main contribution to the field, however, was the formulation, together with Louis Dollo, of paleobiology, which combines the methods and findings of the natural science biology with the methods and findings of the earth science paleontology. From 1928 onwards, Othenio Abel was the publisher of a journal dedicated to paleobiology, Paläobiologica. In 1914, Abel proposed that fossil dwarf elephants inspired the myth of giant Cyclopes, because the center nasal opening was thought to be a cyclopic eye socket.Adrienne Mayor, The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times (Princeton University Press) 2000. In 1920 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He also showed great interest in cave bear remains at the so-called \\"Dragon's Cave\\" near Mixnitz. Abel was an advocate of orthogenesis, he believed that there were trends in evolution that were internally programmed.Peter J. Bowler. (1996). Life's Splendid Drama: Evolutionary Biology and the Reconstruction of Life's Ancestry, 1860-1940. University Of Chicago Press. p. 358.  Political attitude and National Socialism  Already as a student, Abel took part in anti-semitic riots at the University of Vienna, during the Badeni-crisis of 1897. After the First World War, now a professor, he gave voice to his fear of a power takeover by \\"Communists, Social Democrats and Jews and more Jews tied to both\\". As the journalist Klaus Taschwer publicized in 2012, Abel was responsible for the founding of a secret group of 18 professors that sought to frustrate the research and careers of left-wing and Jewish scientists.\\"Hochburg des Antisemitismus\\", Der Standard, 12. Juni 2012Klaus Taschwer, \\"Othenio Abel, Kämpfer gegen die \\"Verjudung\\" der Universität\\", Der Standard, 9. Oktober 2012 The rise in violence of National Socialist student groups towards Jewish students in 1934 were met with sympathy by Abel. When such attacks began to be directed at Catholic and international students as well, Abel, now the university rector, was forced into early retirement by the Austrofascist board. This caused him to emigrate to Germany and accept the post in Göttingen. He visited Vienna again in 1939, after the Anschluss with Nazi Germany. After seeing how the Nazi flag was shown at the university building, he pronounced this the \\"Happiest moment of his life\\". The new regime honored him with the newly created post of \\"Honorary Senator\\" of the University - an honour that was rescinded after the Second World War, in 1945. A letter of recommendation for the Goethe Prize points out how Abel had always \\"fought in the first line\\" against the \\"Judaification\\" of the University.Ute Deichmann: Biologen unter Hitler, As cited in: Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

He traveled to Oregon Country as a secular member of the Methodist mission, where he became involved in politics and helped found the first American newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains. Early life Abernethy was born on October 7, 1807 in New York City.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He was of Scottish descent. He received his education in New York as well as learning the commercial trade. In 1830, Abernethy married Anne Pope. Missionary Jason Lee recruited Abernethy in 1839 to join him at the Methodist Mission in Oregon Country. He, his wife, and two children joined the Great Reinforcement that sailed on the ship Lausanne around Cape Horn to the Pacific Northwest. Oregon Arriving on June 1, 1840, Abernethy was placed in charge as Steward of the Oregon Mission,Gatke, Robert M. A Document of Mission History, 1833-43. Oregon Historical Quarterly 36, No. 1 (1935), pp. 71-94. focusing on the Mission's mercantile business in Oregon City. His specific instructions from the Methodist board requested an annual > account of all the goods, merchandise, clothing, farming and mechanical > utensils, the produce of the farms, and the mechanical shops, the stock on > the farm at a fair valuation, together with the worth of the houses, barns, > mills, and shops, or whatever else may belong to the Mission, and likewise > charge to each member of the Mission family the article or articles he or > she may take from the store or farms for his or her use ... Among his early accomplishments were establishing the first newspaper (the Oregon Spectator) in the Oregon Territory and establishing good business relations with the British Hudson's Bay Company. Abernethy was also a member of the Oregon Lyceum in Oregon City. In 1842 he introduced a resolution there to hold off forming an independent country. This was adopted and counter-acted a resolution introduced by Dr. John McLoughlin of the HBC that had earlier been adopted by the Lyceum. =Governor= On June 3, 1845, Abernethy was elected to serve as Provisional Governor of the Oregon Country, defeating Osborne Russell, a member of the outgoing Executive Committee. Abernethy and his supporters were American loyalists who believed that the Provisional Government was strictly interim until the question of U.S. and British claims on the Oregon Country were finalized. Russell, however, headed up the \\"Independents\\" faction which wished to create a Republic of the Pacific. As provisional governor, Abernethy worked to build roads, levied the first property taxes, and sent representatives of the Provisional Government to Washington, D.C. to lobby for official U.S. territorial status. He was reelected in 1847 with the endorsement of the influential Dr. John McLoughlin over Asa Lovejoy, co-founder of Portland. Among the more interesting prerogatives of Abernethy was his solution to the shortage of U.S. currency throughout the territory. He and eight other leading citizens established the Oregon Exchange Company, which became the de facto territorial mint for a short time. The organization minted the now-rare five dollar and ten dollar \\"Beaver Coins\\", making Oregon one of the few U.S. territories to ever mint its own currency. The Abernethy administration technically ended when efforts to gain territorial status came to fruition on August 14, 1848. President James K. Polk signed the Oregon Territory Act, and appointed General Joseph Lane as the first official territorial governor. Abernethy continued to carry out his duties until Governor Lane arrived at Oregon City March 3, 1849. Later life and legacy Advertisement for steamer Lot Whitcomb, naming George Abernethy as agent After leaving office, Abernethy continued doing well in his business. Among other things he served as the Oregon City agent for the pioneer steamer Lot Whitcomb, the first steam-powered vessel built on the Willamette River and the second one built in the entire Oregon Country. Abernethy's assets were destroyed during the flood of 1861. He moved to Portland shortly after. He died in 1877 at 70 years of age. Abernethy was buried at River View Cemetery. Today, the Abernethy Bridge in Oregon City is named in his honor. The end of the Oregon Trail, also in Oregon City, lies near an area known as Abernethy Green. Several other public works (and natural features such as streams) in Oregon are also named in his honor; though several are given the variant spelling of Abernathy.

This methodology involves taking an archaeological site that has historical accounts relating to recent periods of occupation and then excavating it to establish continuity back into prehistoric times. The historical data then becomes the basis of analogy and homology for the study of the prehistoric communities at both the particular site and other sites in the region. The main issue with the approach is that in many parts of the world there is no direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region.http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?category=&where;=headword&terms;=direct+historical+approach Background In the nineteenth century, the archaeological record of the Americas was viewed as an extension into the past of the ethnographically documented record. Human behaviors of the archaeological past were seen as nearly identical to those described ethnographically and thus, they could be studied with minimal training in archaeology. The result of this particular view was the development and regular use of what came to be known as the direct historical approach. Roland B. Dixon was seen as an early proponent of this approach. In his presidential address to the American Anthropological Association he stated: “one would logically proceed to investigate a [number of sites of known ethnic affiliation], and work back from these,” because it “is only through the known that we can comprehend the unknown, only from a study of the present that we can understand the past.” Strong, who later became attributed to this particular methodology, argued that Dixon set forth the procedure of the direct historical approach. Strong would later go on to say that “once the archeological criteria of [a historically documented] culture had been determined, it [is] then possible to advance from the known and historic into the unknown and prehistoric.”http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf Oddly, the direct historical approach rarely appears in histories of American anthropology. Similarly, very few texts point out that the direct historical approach was used for three distinct purposes. In American archaeology these were: (1) to identify the cultural association of an archaeological manifestation; (2) to construct relative chronologies of archaeological materials; and (3) to understand the human behaviors that were thought to have produced particular portions of the archaeological record. The Direct Historical Approach as a Cultural Identifier After the peak of the direct historical approach, Willey wrote about its use as a means of assigning ethnic identity to archaeological phenomena. He explained: “through a series of successive periods prehistoric cultures were linked to proto-historic, historic, and modern descendants. This type of study, sometimes called the ‘direct historical approach,’ has a theoretical basis in cultural continuity. Starting with known, documented habitation sites, certain cultural assemblages were identified and associated with particular tribal groups. Earlier archaeological assemblages were then sought which were not too sharply divergent from the known historic ones, and the procedure was followed backwards in time…The establishment of prehistoric-to-historic continuity is of utmost importance as a springboard for further archaeological interpretation, and, along with general chronological and distributive studies, it is one of the primary historical problems for the American archaeologist.”http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf Most famously, Cyrus Thomas used the reasoning of the direct historical approach to demonstrate that various earthworks scattered across the eastern and midwestern portions of America (mounds) were produced by the direct genetic and cultural ancestors of historically documented ethnic groups (the indigenous peoples of the Americas). The Direct Historical Approach in Establishing Chronology In much the same way that the direct historical approach was used to demonstrate ancestor-descendant relationships, it was also used to measure the passage of time (also called chronology). This process involves creating time-based sequences of artifacts by starting with a list of cultural traits related to specific artifact types and then working into the past by determining which traits/artifact types were held by archaeologically represented cultures. Through this theoretical sorting, one can study more than ethnic identification by establishing time-based sequences. After ethnic identification and chronology has been established, the direct historical approach becomes the basis of analogy.http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf Issues with the Direct Historical Approach There are large parts of the world that are without direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region. Without this connection, the direct historical approach lacks purpose and is unable to enhance archaeological study. If this is the case, archaeologists rely on other archaeological theories and methods.

The country people took her support for her husband as a dominant nature, but with the passage of time, Queen Aishwarya's dominance over her husband reportedly mellowed down and she was seen as a caring companion for her husband, whose popularity increased with time. Literary works She was interested in literature under the pen-name Chadani Shah, wrote dozens of poems which have been collected under the title Aphnai Akash Aphnai Paribesh. The anthology is prefaced with criticisms about Chadani Shah's writing by veteran critics of Nepalese Literature. She was also a famous song composer and her songs were frequently aired by Radio Nepal and Nepal Television. Death Queen Aishwarya was shot dead along with her husband, King Birendra; her son, Prince Nirajan; her daughter, Princess Shruti; and seven other royal family members. It is widely believed that the motive for the murder was the strong opposition to the Crown Prince's proposed marriage to Devyani Rana. Queen Aishwarya's face was so badly disfigured by the gunshot wound that, for the widely attended state funeral procession, it was covered by a porcelain mask bearing her likeness.Amy Willesee & Mark Whittaker (2004).

On November 9, 2011, in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, Spanier and longtime football coach Joe Paterno were “removed from their positions” by the Penn State board of trustees. Spanier is currently president emeritus, university professor, and professor of human development and family studies; sociology, demography, and family; and community medicine. He had a one-year post- presidential sabbatical leave following his resignation as president of Penn State in November 2011. He was later convicted on March 24, 2017, of one misdemeanor charge of child endangerment. The conviction was overturned by a federal district judge on April 30, 2019. Early life and education Graham Basil Spanier was born to Rosadele Lurie and Fritz Otto Spanier in Cape Town, South Africa and came to Chicago as an infant when his parents immigrated, concerned by parallels they saw between apartheid in South Africa and fascism in Germany. His father had previously escaped Nazi Germany in 1936; much of his father's extended family perished during the Holocaust. The family moved to a working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, living there until 1956. Spanier's father worked in a nuts, bolts and screws warehouse loading and unloading trucks; his mother worked in a clerical position. The family moved to the suburb of Highland Park, where Spanier graduated from Highland Park High School in 1966. His father became postmaster of Highland Park in 1962 and retired from that position in 1975. Spanier has revealed that his father was physically violent with all three of his children. His sister Anita told The New York Times that Graham received the most violent beatings, leaving him with lifelong complications. \\"I've had to have four operations to correct serious deformities inside my head from beatings my father gave me,\\" Spanier said. \\"They had to rebuild me from the inside out.\\" As a teenager, Spanier largely supported himself financially, working part-time jobs at a radio station, a children's clothing store, a legal office, and saving for college by mowing lawns and baby-sitting. He was president of J&A; Radio Productions, a Junior Achievement company that produced a weekly show called \\"Variety\\" targeted to Chicago-area youth. Along with Brian Ross, he co-founded a radio news service that covered the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He attended Iowa State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in three years (in 1969) and continued his education to earn a master's degree (1971). As a graduate student, he taught undergraduate classes in marriage and family sociology while on an assistantship. During college, Spanier served as a head resident in the residence halls and worked in radio and television at WEEF (Chicago), KASI (Ames, Iowa) and WOI-TV (Ames, Iowa). He had summer jobs as a radio announcer, news director, pizza maker, bank teller and public relations officer. He received numerous honors while a university student for his leadership in student government and campus activities, including the Gold Key of the Cardinal Key Honor Society. Iowa State later honored him with the Distinguished Achievement Citation and an honorary doctorate (2004).Graham Spanier note 4 Following his graduation from Iowa State, Spanier attended Northwestern University, where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, and earned his Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. Career Prior to his tenure as president of Penn State, Spanier served as: * Member of the Penn State faculty and served in three administrative positions in the College of Health and Human Development: professor of human development and family studies; sociology, demography; and family and community medicine (1973–82). *Vice provost for undergraduate studies at Stony Brook University (1982–86) *Provost and vice president for academic affairs at Oregon State University (1986–91) *Chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (1991–95) =16th President of The Pennsylvania State University= Spanier in 2005 During his presidency, Spanier set goals to make Penn State the \\"top student-centered research university in America\\" and for the university to lead the nation in \\"the integration of teaching, research, and service.\\" Spanier created the Penn State World Campus, the Schreyer Honors College, the Presidential Leadership Academy, the College of Information Sciences and Technology, the School of International Affairs, and programs in forensic sciences and security and risk analysis. He oversaw the merger with the Dickinson School of Law, creating an accredited and acclaimed two-campus law school. He was recognized by the American Institute of Architects for \\"Outstanding Contribution to the Profession by a Non-Architect\\" (2006) and with the Elizabeth Holtzman Award for his improvements to campus landscaping, master planning, and community relations. During his tenure, applications exceeded 120,000 per year, enrollment grew to 97,000, and the academic standing of dozens of programs rose in national and international rankings. As president, Spanier made a commitment to spend time with students. He performed with Penn State's Musical Theatre students and occasionally with Penn State's marching band, the Glee Club, and the Chamber Orchestra. He and his racquetball partner were 11-time Penn State co-ed intramural racquetball champions. He hosted \\"To the Best of My Knowledge,\\" a live call-in program on public television and radio, and \\"Expert Opinion,\\" a sports topic television program on the Big Ten Network. =Board memberships= Schreyer Honors College Dean Christian Brady (left) and Graham Spanier (right), at the Schreyer Honors College medal ceremony on December 17, 2010. Spanier has served as a board member for the following national boards of directors/trustees: *Association of American Universities, where he served as chair, 2007–08 *Association of State Universities and Land- Grant Colleges, where he served as chair, 2001–02 *Big Ten Conference Council of Presidents/Chancellors, where he served as chair *National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I, where he served as chair and was a member of the Association's Executive Committee, 1997–2001 *Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities for the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, where he served as chair, 1996–2000 *University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (Internet2), where he was a founding member, 1997–2000 *Child Fund International (formerly Christian Children's Fund), 1985–94; chair, 1992–94 *Worldwide Universities Network, where he served as a founding member and vice-chair, 2000–07 *National 4-H Council, 1997–2000 *National Council on Family Relations, where he served as president from 1987–88 *Universities Research Association, 2001–05 *Business Higher Education Forum, 2005–11 *Council on Competitiveness, 1998–2011 *United States Department of Education Commission on Opportunity in Athletics], 2002–03 *Presidential Policy Advisory Board on Information Technology, Chair, 1997–99 *Joint Commission on Accountability Reporting in Higher Education, 1994–97 *Association of Academic Health Centers Council on Health Sciences and the University, where he served as co-chair, 1996–99 *Joint Committee on Higher Education and the Entertainment Communities, where he served as co- chair, 2002–06 *National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, where he served as chair, 2005–11 *United States Steel Corporation, where he served as independent director and was a member of both the Audit Committee and the Corporate Governance & Public Policy Committee, 2008–11 *Citizens Financial Group, where he served as director, 2002–11 *National Counterintelligence Working Group, 2005–11 *Junior Achievement Worldwide, where he served on the Board of Governors, 2003–2011 *FM Global Insurance Company, where he served as director, 2010–12 *Bowl Championship Series, where he served as chair of the Presidential Oversight Committee In addition, Spanier served on the board of advisers for the President at the Naval Postgraduate School and Naval War College. Penn State child sex abuse scandal =Resignation from Penn State= During the investigation into allegations of child sex abuse by former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, dozens of individuals were interviewed by prosecutors, and many were called to testify before a Grand Jury. Those interviewed included Penn State football coaches, staff members and university administrators. Among them were Senior Vice President Gary Schultz, Athletic Director Timothy Curley, Spanier and Head Football Coach Joe Paterno, whose testimony lasted seven minutes. As a result of grand jury testimony, Curley and Schultz were charged with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse. Spanier issued a statement the day the charges came to light in which he said Curley and Schultz had his \\"complete confidence\\",Pérez-Peña, Richard, \\"Rich in Success, Rooted in Secrecy\\", The New York Times, November 21, 2011. Retrieved November 23, 2011. and they \\"operate at the highest levels of honesty.\\"Spanier: Curley, Schultz 'Operate at the Highest Levels of Honesty' Spanier was criticized for expressing support for Curley and Schultz, and failing to express any concern for Sandusky's alleged victims. After this, he largely dropped from public view. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the Board of Trustees ordered him to keep silent. Paterno's son, Jay Paterno, reported that the board of trustees chair, John P. Surma, then ordered that Coach Paterno's weekly press conference be canceled. On Nov. 6, 2011, a Facebook group titled “Fire Graham Spanier” was created by a Penn State alumnus to pressure the board of trustees. The group never achieved more than 100 members. Also on Facebook, an event titled \\"Sit in Silence during the Alma Mater\\" encouraged attendees of the final home football game of the season on Saturday, Nov. 12 to sit in silence while the Penn State Blue Band performed the Alma Mater. An online petition calling for Spanier's ouster was created at change.org by a professional blogger and self-described \\"reality-based charismatic/Pentecostal Christian\\" who had no connection to the university. It garnered over 1,800 signatures in four days before closing. At emergency meetings on Nov 5 and 6, Spanier briefed the board of trustees. The board decided that they alone wanted to manage the unfolding crisis. On the night of November 9, the board announced that Spanier had resigned and Paterno had been fired — in both cases, effective immediately.Penn State trustees oust football coach Joe Paterno, president Graham Spanier Several Penn State sources told StateCollege.com and The Patriot-News of Harrisburg that Spanier and Board of Trustees vice chairman John Surma mutually agreed that the best way forward for all involved would be for Spanier to resign \\"voluntarily and with grace.\\"Former Penn State president Graham Spanier volunteered to resign, wasn't fired, report says. The Patriot-News, Retrieved November 17, 2011.Smeltz, Adam. Sources: Spanier Volunteered to Step Aside at Penn State, Was Not Fired. StateCollege.com, November 16, 2011. Other sources said the decision was not entirely voluntary; earlier that day The Express-Times of Easton reported the Board of Trustees had given Spanier an ultimatum—resign before that night's meeting or be fired. A member of the board later told The Morning Call of Allentown that the board was very angry about his statement of unconditional support for Curley and Schultz.Kennedy, Sam; McGill, Andrew. Trustee: Media frenzy forced board's hand. The Morning Call, Retrieved November 10, 2011. ABC News reported that Spanier had submitted a letter of resignation earlier in the day on Nov. 9. Provost Rodney Erickson was named his successor. In the wake of the Sandusky investigation, a Phoenix, Arizona private investigator named Paul McLaughlin publicly alleged he had been sexually abused by Penn State Professor John R. Neisworth and two other men in the late 1970s and early 1980s. McLaughlin claimed to possess a tape of telephone conversations with university officials, including Spanier, to verify that he had tried twenty years later to inform the university, but he later had to file an affidavit acknowledging that he did not have such tapes. The charges filed against Neisworth and the two other men in 2005 were dropped that same year for lack of evidence. =The Freeh Report and related lawsuits= In November 2011 the Penn State Board of Trustees hired former FBI Director Louis Freeh to conduct an external investigation into the handling of the Sandusky matter. Released on July 12, 2012, the Freeh report concluded that Spanier, Curley, Schultz and Paterno \\"concealed Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities.\\" In addition, the report said the four men \\"exhibited a striking lack of empathy for Sandusky's victims by failing to inquire as to their safety and well- being\\" and that they allowed him \\"to have continued, unrestricted and unsupervised access to the University's facilities and affiliation with the University's prominent football program.\\" Spanier and his attorneys disputed the accuracy of Freeh's findings, alleging it contained \\"many, many errors.\\" A later report commissioned by the Paterno family by former U.S. Attorney General and former Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, concluded that the Freeh report was \\"seriously flawed\\" and a \\"failure.\\" Freeh's firm was reportedly paid $6.5 million by the Penn State trustees to compile the report. Subsequent billings have raised the amount to $8.2 million. A ruling by an arbitrator for the State Employee Retirement System, in an appeal pertaining to the revocation of Sandusky's pension in June 2014, also called into serious question the credibility of the Freeh Report. Earlier that month, on July 11, one year after the release of the Freeh report, Spanier's attorneys filed a lawsuit against Freeh and Freeh's firm, Sporkin & Sullivan, citing slander, libel and defamation. The suit demanded monetary damages and a jury trial. In two rulings in Centre County Court, and in a subsequent appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, Freeh's efforts to force Spanier to file the details of his formal complaint were turned down as premature. On February 25, 2014, over the objections of Louis Freeh and his law firm, Spanier was granted a stay in his defamation lawsuit until his criminal case is resolved. On February 10, 2016, Spanier filed separate lawsuits against Freeh and Penn State, claiming university trustees and Freeh colluded in placing blame for Sandusky's sexual misconduct on lack of action by Paterno, Schultz, Curley and Spanier. Spanier seeks a damage judgment against Freeh for defamation, and against the university for breaching terms agreed to upon his resignation in 2011. =Criminal charges= On November 1, 2012, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly announced that Spanier had been indicted for grand jury perjury, obstruction of justice, child endangerment, failure to report child abuse and conspiracy in connection with the scandal. The charges were partially based on findings in the Freeh report. Curley and Schultz were also indicted for these charges in a superseding indictment. On July 30, 2013, the charges formally moved ahead following a preliminary hearing by District Judge William Wenner. Pretrial hearings in the case against Spanier began on December 17, 2013. Dauphin County Judge Todd Hoover ruled at that time that Spanier's attorneys would not be allowed to call to the stand Cynthia Baldwin. Baldwin, who had been an attorney for Penn State, had accompanied Spanier, Schultz and Curley to their grand jury appearances in 2011. All three men would testify they believed Baldwin was their legal representation. Later, under the protection of a proffer agreement—a form of immunity—with the attorney general, Baldwin testified against the three men in her grand jury testimony. Attorneys for Spanier, Curley and Schultz asserted this was a violation of attorney-client privilege and their clients' civil rights. Elizabeth Ainslie, one of Spanier's attorneys, said, \\"I was never notified that Ms. Baldwin was going to testify against Graham Spanier, and neither was he. [Baldwin] says different things at different times about who she represented.\\" On January 22, 2016, a three judge panel of the Pennsylvania Superior Court unanimously overturned a decision by Judge Hoover and threw out charges of perjury, obstruction and conspiracy against Spanier and Schultz, and charges of obstruction and conspiracy against Curley. The court found that Baldwin breached attorney-client privilege by testifying as to confidential communications between her and Spanier to the grand jury. =Trial and overturned conviction= Shortly before their cases were to go to trial, Curley and Schultz accepted plea deals for one misdemeanor count each of endangering the welfare of children. Spanier refused a similar deal and went to trial on March 20, 2017 on two counts of endangering the welfare of children and one charge alleging conspiracy with Curley and Schultz to cover up a molestation allegation against Sandusky; both Curley and Schultz testified at Spanier's trial. On March 24, Spanier was found not guilty of the conspiracy charge and one of the endangerment counts. He was, however, found guilty of one count of endangerment in a split verdict. His attorney indicated they would appeal the guilty verdict. On June 2, 2017, Spanier was sentenced to two months jail and two months house arrest. Additionally, Spanier was ordered to pay a $7,500 fine and perform 200 hours of community service. Curley and Schultz began serving their sentences on July 15,http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/penn-states-spanier-sentenced- to-jail-for-role-in-sandusky-scandal-20170602.html but Spanier remained free while he appealed his conviction. On June 26, 2018 his appeal to the Superior Court was rejected by a vote of two to one. One of Spanier's attorneys said that Spanier would pursue a further appeal. On April 30, 2019, one day before Spanier was to have reported to Centre County Correctional Facilityhttp://centrecountypa.gov/index.aspx?NID=226 to begin serving a two- month sentence, his conviction was overturned. U.S. Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick ruled the conviction \\"was based on a criminal statute that did not go into effect until six years after the conduct in question, and is therefore in violation of Spanier’s federal constitutional rights.” Selected publications Spanier has published more than 100 scholarly publications, including 10 books. He was the founding editor of the Journal of Family Issues, an associate editor of the Journal of Marriage and the Family, and a member of the editorial advisory board of the Journal of Marriage and Family Counseling.

Independent kindreds are more typical within the US than elsewhere. Internal structure Kindreds are often composed of hearths or families as well as individuals, and the members of a kindred may be related by blood or marriage, or may be unrelated. The kindred functions as a religious group, and often also as an extended family. Membership is managed according to the legal organization of the group, which may range from an Unincorporated Associations to various forms of Corporate bodies. Kindreds usually function as cell groups, but sometimes as formal churches, study groups, or clubs. There is a prevalent interest in communal philosophy (called tribalism within Asatru), but no kindreds are known put that practice into action through land ownership. =Gothar= The kindreds usually have a recognized (priest) or (priestess) to lead religious rites Historically, most gothar are ordained by the religious groups that recognize them through a process alone, based on who is judged by the group to be a spiritual leader.

The VX800 was designed at U.S. Suzuki's Design Studio in Brea, California from 1986 to 1989, and produced in the years 1990 to 1997. Lackluster sales in the United States brought the model to an end in 1993, the European version was produced until 1997. Concept and prototype Among others, the design team consisted of Don Presnell, Lead Designer-styling, Aki Goto as Lead Engineer and Sam Yamazaki for frame and engine engineering. Sam Yamazaki and Aki Goto were the inspired R&D; engineers who started putting together a crude prototype at the Brea Studio utilizing a 750 cc Intruder engine in a modified Intruder frame. The rake and trail were modified on that prototype, as were the footpeg/shifter positions. The prototype was finished off with a hand- hammered aluminum tank mastered by Sam Yamazaki. The first full scale clay modeling of the VX750 was done by Don Presnell at the Brea facility. A quote by Don Presnell on the changes made in Japan on the concept. \\"The original full-scale clay model that I accompanied over to Japan had a rear fender/seat more like the first sketch. It's true that Japanese management did want to play it safe, so they went with the more traditional styling on the rear fender. Many times a transportation Designer's sketches/models get compromised when it gets to the Marketing Dept. stage!\\" The suspension, engine work and final touches on the frame were done in Hammamatsu, Japan, once the concept & design direction were established, at this point it was out of the hands of the U.S. development team. Variations There were four variations of the VX800: *the Japanese version featured a slightly shorter frame. *the European version was equipped with the pre-production 75-degree crank pin offset for smoother operation at high engine speeds.Cycle, July 1990, pg 60 *the American version was offered from 1990 to 1993 only. It was equipped with the Intruder's 45-degree crank pin offset as American Suzuki tests riders claimed the 75-degree crank offset made the engine feel dull and lifeless at US speeds. It also makes for a more charismatic exhaust cadence. American Suzuki also requested that the overall gearing be lower for better acceleration. The USA version has a secondary reduction of 1.133, where other markets have a 1.096 secondary reduction. *the California version was the same as the USA version, but with additional anti-smog equipment. Engine The engine for the VX800 was derived from the Intruder 750, with a 3 mm larger bore to increase displacement, and larger 36 mm carburetors replacing the 34 mm units.

Rotary converters were used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), or DC to AC power, before the advent of chemical or solid state power rectification and inverting. They were commonly used to provide DC power for commercial, industrial and railway electrification from an AC power source. Rotary converters are still used as frequency converters. Principles of operation Wiring schematic for a simplified bipolar field Gramme ring single-phase to direct current rotary converter. (In actual use, the converter is drum-wound and uses a multipolar field.)Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1459, fig. 2034 two-phase to direct current rotary converter, with the second phase connected at right angles to the first.Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1460, fig. 2035 three-phase to direct current rotary converter, with the phases separated by 120 degrees on the commutator.Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1461, fig. 2036 The rotary converter can be thought of as a motor-generator, where the two machines share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the rotary converter consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator. The device can be reversed and DC applied to the field and commutator windings to spin the machine and produce AC power. When operated as a DC to AC machine it is referred to as an inverted rotary converter. One way to envision what is happening in an AC-to-DC rotary converter is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could rectify the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch. The rotary converter is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the rotary converter avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical. The advantage of the rotary converter over the discrete motor- generator set is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum. In this first illustration of a single-phase to direct-current rotary converter, it may be used five different ways:Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1461 * If the coil is rotated, alternating currents can be taken from the collector rings, and it is called an alternator. * if the coil is rotated, direct current can be taken from the commutator, and it is called a dynamo. * If the coil is rotated, two separate currents can be taken from the armature, one providing direct current and the other providing alternating current. Such a machine is called a double current generator. * If a direct current is applied to the commutator, the coil will begin to rotate as a commutated electric motor and an alternating current can be taken out of the collector rings. This is called an inverted rotary converter (see Inverter). * If the machine is brought up to synchronous speed by external means and if the direction of the current through the armature has the correct relationship to the field coils, then the coil will continue to rotate in synchronism with the alternating current as a synchronous motor. A direct current can be taken from the commutator. When used this way, it is called a rotary converter. =Self-balancing dynamo= The self-balancing dynamo is of similar construction to the single- and two- phase rotary converter. It was commonly used to create a completely balanced three-wire 120/240-volt DC electrical supply. The AC extracted from the slip rings was fed into a transformer with a single center-tapped winding. The center-tapped winding forms the DC neutral wire. It needed to be driven by a mechanical power source, such as a steam engine, diesel engine, or electric motor. It could be considered a rotary converter used as a double current generator; the AC current was used to balance the DC neutral wire. History Railroad Rotary Converter from Illinois Railway Museum The rotary converter was invented by Charles S. Bradley in 1888.Hughes, Thomas Parke. Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press - 1993, pp=120–121 A typical use for this type of AC/DC converter was for railway electrification, where utility power was supplied as alternating current but the trains were designed to work on direct current. Before the invention of mercury arc rectifiers and high-power semiconductor rectifiers, this conversion could only be accomplished using motor-generators or rotary converters. Rotary converter soon filled the need to combine all the competing electric power delivery systems that cropped up in the 1880s an early 1890s. These included single phase AC systems, poly- phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars.Garud, Raghu; Kumaraswamy, Arun; Langlois, Richard (2009). Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations. New York: John Wiley & Sons. p. 249Hughes, Thomas Parke. Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press - 1993, pp=120–121 Most machinery and appliances at that time were operated by DC power which was provided by rotary converter substations for residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Rotary converters provided high current DC power for industrial electrochemical processes such as electroplating. Steel mills needed large amounts of on-site DC power for their main roll drive motors. Similarly, paper mills and printing presses required direct current to start and stop their motors in perfect synchronization to prevent tearing the sheet. =Obsolescence= The stopgap of needing to use rotary converters was slowly overcome as older systems were retired or upgraded to match the newer AC universal system. AC to DC synchronous rotary converters were made obsolete by mercury arc rectifiers in the 1930s and later on by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous rotary converters operated until 1999. Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury arc and semiconductor rectifiers did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance. AC replaced DC in most applications and eventually the need for local DC substations diminished along with the need for rotary converters. Many DC customers converted to AC power, and on-site solid-state DC rectifiers were used to power the remaining DC equipment from the AC supply.

An associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and director of the Immunobiology Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, her work specializes in diabetes mellitus type 1 (formerly called juvenile diabetes) and other autoimmune diseases. She has worked at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston since 1985. Education and career Faustman was born in Royal Oak, Michigan in 1958. In 1978, she received her BS in zoology and chemistry from the University of Michigan. She earned a Ph.D. in transplantation immunology in 1982 and an MD in 1985 from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. She did her internship and residency in medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Research Faustman's current research is based on the observation that autoreactive T cells (T cells that mistakenly attack the body's own cells and tissues) are more sensitive than normal T cells to the effects of TNF-alpha (TNF-α), a cytokine that influences the immune system. Under some conditions, TNF-α causes T cells to undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Faustman's hypothesis is that certain autoimmune diseases can be treated by stimulating TNF-α to trigger apoptosis in autoimmune T cells. Prior to entering human clinical trials, Faustman's approach was tested in non-obese diabetic mice (NOD mice), a strain of mice that spontaneously develops type 1 diabetes. Injecting the mice with a common inflammatory agent that increases the production of TNF-α, called complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and a preparation of spleen cells reversed type 1 diabetes in mice with end-stage disease and allowed the beta islet cells to regenerate. Faustman hypothesized that this regeneration may be attributed in part to the re-differentiation of the spleen cells – that although the splenic stem cells were not obligatory for regeneration to occur, these cells could hasten regeneration. The source of islet cell regeneration is debated. Faustman's team was the first to document type 1 diabetes reversal in mice and in a subsequent phase I trial demonstrated successful human clinical results who had received the BCG vaccination. Researchers from three laboratories funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation confirmed that Dr. Faustman's protocol can successfully reverse type 1 diabetes in end-stage mice; however, they did not find that the splenic cells played a role and suggested that the source of islet cell regeneration was proliferation of existing pancreatic islet cells. A research group led by a researcher from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) replicated Faustman's work in mice with type 1 diabetes. =Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine= Former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, whose wife died of type 1 diabetes complications and who has declared a desire to see the disease cured in his lifetime, is a patron of her work. The Iacocca Foundation helped raise the $11.5 million needed to support a Phase I human clinical trial (for safety) at Massachusetts General Hospital to test vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a weakened strain of bacteria that is used in the prevention of tuberculosis and in the treatment of bladder tumors and bladder cancer, as a potential treatment for advanced type 1 diabetes. Like CFA in the mouse (not approved for use in humans), BCG induces TNF-α production in humans. In some human trials, BCG was not found to prevent type 1 diabetes, or lead to type 1 diabetes remission in those who are newly diagnosed, although one study from Israel showed disease remission in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, and an observational study from Turkey suggestsed that multiple doses of the BCG vaccine in childhood may protect against the development of type 1 diabetes. Faustman hypothesizes that the optimal dose of BCG was not utilized in previous trials. Faustman hypothesizes that BCG could induce a permanent gene expression that restores regulatory T cells (Tregs), helping to prevent the immune system attack which characterizes type 1 diabetes. =Clinical trials= Faustman and co-workers published efficacy data from the Phase I trial NCT00607230ClinicalTrials.gov: Determination of Dosing and Frequency of BCG Administration to Alter T-Lymphocyte Profiles in Type I Diabetics, Last updated: November 4, 2013 in 2012. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study, six participants with long-term (mean duration of disease 15 years) type 1 diabetes were randomized to repeated BCG vaccinations (n=3) or placebo (n=3). The participants were matched to control subjects without diabetes (n=6) and also compared to reference subjects with and without the disease. Blood samples were monitored weekly for 20 weeks. Two of the three BCG-treated participants experienced a transient but statistically significant rise in C-peptide levels compared to reference subjects. Participants who received BCG vaccination also experienced a transient increase in the number of circulating dead autoreactive T cells against insulin. One participant who was randomized to the placebo arm also had similar rises in C-peptide and dead autoreactive T cells after unexpectedly developing an acute infection with the Epstein-Barr virus; it, like the BCG vaccination, is known to induce TNF. Faustman et al. concluded that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies advanced type 1 diabetes. The data from the Phase I trial has sparked some controversy regarding the scientific rigor of the study, and the JDRF and the ADA made a joint statement listing concerns with the trial.

Pupils from Bristol also attend the school. There are around 1,189,pupils, including 360 in the sixth form. The main school site on Park Road has seen additions in recent years including the community sports centre, and the Octagon art gallery and classroom. The Gloucester Road buildings approximately half a mile away are primarily used as the sixth form centre, but also house the vocational faculty used by lower years. Former headmaster Adrian Verwoert was awarded a CBE for services to education in May 2004. Joining the school in 1980, he was appointed as head in 1988. He was succeeded by Melanie Warnes in September 2004. She left in 2014. History In 1862, Handel Cossham, a local preacher, built the original village school, a British School, at Gillingstool. Some years later, because of overcrowding, a new infant school building was added adjacent to the original school. In 1952 the school was separated into infants, juniors and seniors and the latter formed the Thornbury County Secondary school. Before this it was an 'all-age' school taking pupils up to age thirteen, known as Thornbury Council School. In 1962, during the headship of Mr Cliff J. Martin, plans were drawn up for a new building to house the expanding secondary school. Building work started the following year on Park Road, the site used as the school's playing field. In 1965, the building was opened under the new name of The Castle School, which reflected the school's new position adjacent to Thornbury Castle, whilst keeping the same initials (TCS). The official opening ceremony took place in 1966, attended by the Duke of Beaufort, Chancellor at the University of Bristol at the time. The county infant and junior schools at Gillingstool later formed the Leaze School, which is now known as Gillingstool Primary School. The school became a comprehensive in 1972, the same year that Thornbury Grammar School moved from its site on Gloucester Road to new buildings in Alveston (also becoming a comprehensive with the new name of Marlwood School). The Castle School took over the Gloucester Road buildings which now form its Sixth Form Centre.

Most viewfinders are separate, and suffer parallax, while the single- lens reflex camera lets the viewfinder use the main optical system. Viewfinders are used in many cameras of different types: still and movie, film, analog and digital. A zoom camera usually zooms its finder in sync with its lens, one exception being rangefinder cameras. History Before the development of microelectronics and electronic display devices, only optical viewfinders existed. =Direct optical viewfinders= Direct viewfinders are essentially miniature Galilean telescopes; the viewer's eye was placed at the back, and the scene viewed through the viewfinder optics. A declining minority of point and shoot cameras use them. Parallax error results from the viewfinder being offset from the lens axis, to point above and usually to one side of the lens. The error varies with distance, being negligible for distant scenes, and very large for close-ups. Viewfinders often show lines to indicate the edge of the region which would be included in the photograph. Some sophisticated 20th century cameras with direct viewfinders had coincidence (split-image) rangefinders, initially with separate windows from the viewfinder, later integrated with it; they were called rangefinder cameras. Cameras with interchangeable lenses had to indicate the field of view of each lens in the viewfinder; more usually, interchangeable viewfinders to match the lenses were used.

Such viewfinders were integrated into box cameras, and fitted to the side of folding cameras. These viewfinders were fitted to inexpensive cameras. File:Hasselblad 1600F.jpgHasselblad File:Ansco Panda.jpgChild's waist-view box camera File:Mamiya 645 1000s waist level finder.JPGMamiya 645 1000s waist level finder File:Robot Royal III camera with Zeiss Ikon waist level viewfinder attachment.jpgRobot Royal III camera with Zeiss Ikon waist level viewfinder attachment =Sportsfinder (sports viewfinder)= For many sports and press applications optical viewfinders gave too small an image and were inconvenient to use for scenes that were changing rapidly. For these purposes a simple arrangement of two wire rectangles, a smaller one nearer the eye and a larger one further away, was used, with no optics; the two rectangles were aligned so the smaller one was centred in the larger, and the larger rectangle would give an indication of what would be included. This was fast and convenient to use, but not particularly accurate; cameras with sportsfinders usually had optical viewfinders too. A sportsfinder is sometimes known as an Albada finder. It is a \\"viewfinder used with a camera held at eye level; the field of view is enclosed by a white frame that is made to appear very distant by reflection from the rear surface of the objective lens\\". =Twin-lens reflex viewfinders= Using a TLR Twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras had a large lens above the taking lens, and a large mirror at 45°, projecting an image onto a ground glass screen viewable from above, with the camera at waist level. The viewfinder lens was of similar size and focal length to the taking lens, though the optical quality was less critical; the mirror was of similar size to the film. These cameras were relatively expensive; the Rolleiflex and cheaper sister Rolleicord were the pioneers. Both single- and twin-lens reflexes allowed focussing by adjusting the lens until the image was sharp. =Single-lens reflex viewfinders= Mamiya 645 1000s AE finder Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras viewed the scene through the taking lens. Early SLRs were plate cameras, with a mechanism to insert a mirror between the lens and the film which reflected the light upwards, where it could be seen at waist level on a ground glass screen. When ready to take the picture, the mirror was pivoted out of the way (without moving the camera). Later SLRs had a mechanism which flipped the mirror out of the way when the shutter button was pressed, followed immediately by the shutter opening. Instead of a waist-level arrangement, a prism was used to allow the camera to be held to the eye. The big advantage of the SLR was that any lens, or other optical device, could be used; the viewfinder always showed exactly the image that would be projected onto the film. The live preview feature of digital cameras share this advantage of the SLR, as they also show the image exactly as it will be recorded, with no additional optics or parallax error. Contemporary viewfinders Viewfinders can be optical or electronic. An optical viewfinder is simply a reversed telescope mounted to see what the camera will see. Its drawbacks are many, but it also has advantages; it consumes no power, it does not wash out in sunlight, and it has \\"full resolution\\" (i.e. the resolution of the photographer's eye). An electronic viewfinder (EVF) is a CRT, LCD or OLED based display device, though only the LCD is commonplace today due to size and weight. In addition to its primary purpose, an electronic viewfinder can be used to replay previously captured material, and as an on-screen display to browse through menus. A still camera's optical viewfinder typically has one or more small supplementary LED displays surrounding the view of the scene. On a film camera, these displays show shooting information such as the shutter speed and aperture and, for autofocus cameras, provide an indication that the image is correctly focussed. Digital still cameras will typically also display information such as the current ISO setting and the number of remaining shots which can be taken in a burst. Another display which overlays the view of the scene is often provided. It typically shows the location and state of the camera's provided auto-focus points. This overlay can also provide lines or a grid which assist in picture composition. SLR viewfinder information View through a Pentax K20D viewfinder (without lens) It is not uncommon for a camera to have two viewfinders. For example, a digital still camera may have an optical viewfinder and an electronic one. The latter can be used to replay previously captured material, has an on-screen display, and can be switched off to save power. A camcorder may have two viewfinders, both electronic. The first is viewed through a magnifying eyepiece, and due to a rubber eyepiece it can be viewed perfectly even in bright light. The second viewfinder would be larger, of a higher resolution, and may be mounted on the side of the camera. Because it consumes more power, a method is often provided to turn it off to save energy. In late 2010, Fujifilm announced hybrid viewfinder of optical viewfinder and electronic viewfinder in one viewfinder for its highend compact cameras. There is a half mirror prism that reflect data from LCD to the optical viewfinder, so we can see both the shooting frame and the shooting data. A button can change the hybrid function to electronical viewfinder by blocking the image through the optical viewfinder with moving a half mirror prism to be a straight up mirror. Some special purpose cameras do not have viewfinders at all. These are, for example, web cameras and video surveillance cameras. They use external monitors as their viewfinders.

Saliagos island is the most ancient settlement in the Cyclades, and Despotiko, an uninhabited island in the southwest of Antiparos, is a place of great archaeological importance. The Community of Antiparos was founded in 1914 and was promoted to a municipality in 2010 with the implementation of the Law \\"Kallikrates\\", under the principle of \\"each island a municipality\\". It occupies an area of 45.182 square km, including the island of Antiparos and Despotiko. It has, according to the 2011 census, 1,211 permanent residents and a density of 27 inhabitants per km². The island's economy is based on tourism, fishing, farming and less on agriculture in the plains. It is known for its white houses, cobbled streets and the flowers that thrive in the yards of the houses. It is a tourist resort in the summer for Greeks and European visitors, as well as land investors from the United States. The main settlement lies at the northeastern tip of the island, opposite Pounda on the main island of Paros, whence a ferry sails for Antiparos harbour. The historical center is located in the Venetian castle of Antiparos, which is connected through the shopping streets in the picturesque coastal street. Other settlements are the resort of St. George in the southwest edge, Soros and Kampos. Beaches in the wider area of the center are Psaralyki, the Sifneiko, Ag Spiridon and the camping beach. Other beaches include: Soros, Glyfa, Apantima, Monastiria. Etymology The ancient name of the island was \\"Oliaros\\", a word probably of Phoenician origin meaning \\"wooded mountain.\\" Later the island was named \\"Antiparos\\" Situated within walking distance from Paros. Geography and topography eastern coast of Antiparos The island of Antiparos is located 0.8 nautical mi (1.5 km) southwest of Paros, separated by the Strait of Antiparos, known as Amfigeio. It lies from the port of Parikia from which the passenger ferry runs. The maximum length of the island is from north to south, while the maximum width reaches . The total area is estimated at . And the highest peak, St. Elias, in the middle of the island, is at 308 m. The main town is called simply Antiparos. Antiparos is a volcanic rock and dry climate with high moisture, and morphology favors the development of strong winds. The flowers thrive in the region are mainly bougainvillea that adorn the gardens, houses and shops. The morphology of Antiparos is characterised essentially flat, with many small hilly peaks, while the vegetation of the island is low. The island of Antiparos is surrounded by many small uninhabited islands with great historical and archaeological interest, such as Tsimintiri the Round, the Double, snow, Revmatonisi, the Red and Black Tourlos. Particularly well known in the international community is Despotiko, an uninhabited island west of Antiparos, where in recent years excavations of great archaeological importance have been carried out. Economy Antiparos stores The island economy is based largely on tourism: the income from visits to the Cave of Antiparos form a very big part of the budget of the municipality. Most people work in the shops, restaurants and accommodation on the island during the tourist season from Easter to October, with the remainder funded by the Employment Service, or undertaking technical and manual jobs. The island's economy is also helped by agriculture and animal husbandry, and fisheries. Since the 1970s and 1980s, Antiparos has become a popular holiday destination, particularly for nudists, attracted by the remote and sandy beaches. The best known is the Camping, or Theologians beach, at the north of the island, opposite the uninhabited island of Diplo. The far end of the town beach is also nudist, as is the Perigiali beach. However most of the other beaches on Antiparos are textile. Since the 1990s there has been a steady development due to its proximity to Paros, and the infrastructure has been improved to accommodate the growing influx of tourists. Archaeology Exhibits at the local museum There are extensive Neolithic remains on the island. It seems the first excavations were those made by the traveller Theodore Bent, with his wife Mabel, in early 1884, opening up some 40 graves in two cemeteries. See J.T. Bent ‘Researches among the Cyclades’. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1884, Vol. 5, 42-59. In 1889 Christos Tsountas excavated in Despotiko, revealing Cycladic cemeteries. From 1964-5 a Neolithic settlement was excavated on the island of Saliagos by Colin Renfrew and J D Evans for the British School at Athens. Stone foundations of buildings, obsidian arrowheads and pottery were found, together with a marble figurine known as the Fat lady of Saliagos. Classical remains are concentrated on the island of Despotiko. The Isle of Antiparos was identified with ancient Prepesintho, according to the extant writings of Strabo and Pliny. In 1959 Nikos Zafiropoulos began excavations at Zoumparia and Mantra, on the northeast coast, where there were architecturally Doric temples from the ancient times, dating to 500 BC. In 1997, the archaeologist Yiannos Kourayos began new excavations at Mantra, bringing to light some of the ancillary buildings of a sanctuary. The temple itself has not so far been discovered, though a number of architectural elements from an early Doric temple have been discovered built into later walls. The main finding so far has been an elongated building, consisting of five consecutive parallel rooms. In the southern room archaic materials of Eastern Aegean, Rhodian, Cypriot and Egyptian origin have been discovered. Many marble sculptures were found, including two archaic kouros heads, a naked male statue, part of the Archaic period perirrantiriou inscribed with the inscription \\"Marda anethiken\\". Among the significant findings include the built-square marble altar dedicated to Hestia Isthmus of classical times and which is testimony to one of the deities worshiped in the Cyclades. History The \\"Camara\\" (entrance to the Kastro) The island, under the name Oliarus or Oliaros, was noted by several ancient authors including Pliny the Elder, Strabo, Virgil, and Stephanus of Byzantium. According to Heraclides Ponticus, it was colonised by Sidonians. During Byzantine times and down to the 13th century, information about the history of Antiparos is scarce. However, in 1207, Antiparos was seized by the Venetian nobleman Marco I Sanudo, and it remained under the house of Sanudo down to the second half of the 14th century, when it passed to the House of Sommaripa. In 1480 it passed to the Venetian house of the Pisani. The Venetian episode came to an end in 1537, when Antiparos and the rest of the Cyclades fell to the Ottomans, and it remained under Ottoman rule until the Greek War of Independence in 1821, apart from a period of the Orlov Revolt in 1770–74 when it was ruled by the Russians, who removed many of the magnificent stalactites from the cave to the Hermitage Museum in Russia. In 1770 the French botanist Joseph Tornefort reported that Antiparos numbered 78 houses about 200 residents The \\"Ksopyrga\\" The major catastrophe was in 1794, when Kefalonians and Mani pirates arrived on the island and plundered, and kidnapped the daughter of the Venetian vice- Consul. The Antiparians were among the first in the Cyclades to take part in the War of Independence and in 1832 officially became part of the Greek state. During World War II, the southwestern tip of the island near the Agios George, was used as a secret submarine base, but after the war it became once more a tranquil place, though now growing as a tourist village. Antiparos was known to the wider Greek public in 1960 and through the Greek cinema, where workshops hosted by Finos Films in the heart of the movie \\"Madalena\\" by helping to enhance its natural beauty and historical landscape. Since then, the island became a tourist destination for Greek and foreign tourists in the summer and the economy of the town started oriented tourism development. Architecture Kastro architecture The architecture, like all the Cycladic islands, requires strict regulations to preserve the uniformity of the Cyclades, which is composed of the typical white houses with blue doors and windows, yard and gardens decorated with bougainvillea and other flowers. Often these characteristics are consistent with the existence of stone or alleys of the neighborhood or the fences of the churchyard. The castle was built in 1440 and seems to have a very specific and unique style of architecture. The houses form a compact complex with 24 two-story houses forming the outer zone, while at the centre there is a motte or mound, till recently occupied by a water reservoir. Among the houses there are three churches and the old aqueduct. The houses have mostly been turned round to face outwards where they act as shops. Sights The church of Saint John, \\"O Spiliotis\\" In the center of the island is the cave of Antiparos, one of the most beautiful and mysterious caves in the world. The cave has been used as a natural shelter from the Neolithic period onwards. The area was also used for pottery, and for the worship of the goddess Artemis, while at the entrance to the site is the church of Agios Ioannis Spiliotis. The Antiparos cavernSigns and scratches on the stalactites and stalagmites attest to the passers, as the inscription on the altar of the generals of Alexander the Great and King Otto. =The cave of Antiparos= The cave is very extensive, and extends at several levels. The lyric poet Archilochus of Paros is said to have left an inscription in the cave. In 1673, marquis de Nointel, French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, visited the cave for three days with numerous companions and celebrated mass on Christmas Day in it. Later visitors who carved their names include Lord Byron and the first modern King of Greece, Otto. During the German occupation, part of the cave was destroyed. The cave was renovated extensively in the second half of the 20th century, using funds from the EU by erecting barriers, building adequate steps, installing lighting, security cameras and loudspeakers to inform visitors. =Castle (Kastro) of Antiparos= The castle tower The Venetian Castle of Antiparos is a typical example of the fortified settlements established in the Cyclades during the period of the Latins in 13th-16th century. Its construction dates to the mid-15th century when the Venetian Giovanni Loredano decided to marry Mary Sommaripa of Antiparos. The original version had a ‘motte’ (mound) at the centre and houses round the perimeter. The houses were built as one continuous block construction, the outer walls providing both the defensive wall of the fortified settlement. The only entrance was at the south wing. Inside the main settlement the houses developed as three-storey structures, each having a separate entrance which leads to an external staircase. In the course of the settlement was extended outside the south wing to form a rectangular ring called \\"Xopyrga\\" and within the original enclosure around the base of the circular tower. Castle house blocks and the church of Christ In modern times, the original architectural style of the castle has altered, with the church of Christ being inserted as a religious element, while the central mound was used as a water tank tower. Today, the homes retain a satisfactory level of their original features, despite the collapse of the upper floors, and any intervention required permission from the archaeological department. Today most homes are developed in one with two floors and have a maximum ground-like trapdoor. Many now face outwards and have become shops facing onto the main street. An integral part of the castle of Antiparos are the small bats that come with dusk and fly around the tower to the east. Infrastructure Antiparos Municipality Hall The town hall of Antiparos lies with the Multi- alley clinic in a commercial road just before the castle, near the Plaza Roussos which took its name from the writer of film \\"Madeleine.\\" Any waste transported to the island a special place in Paros and sewerage and biological treatment have been included in the NSRF to sponsor the Egnatia Odos. The island has a modern road construction and rehabilitation of the coastal road. The focus of artistic and political events is the stone square of Agia Marina. The elementary school has a youth club for young people. Church The Antiparos church belongs to the Bishopric Paronaxia.

Women were primarily desired as police radio dispatchers because LAPD psychologists thought that women's voices would have a more soothing and calming effect over the airwaves. The idea was that, should an officer (male) have been pinned down by gunfire and/or wounded, yet was still within radio contact, hearing the female dispatcher's tone would help keep the officer from panicking until back-up arrived at the scene. Her husband was an LAPD motorcycle officer. For a time from the late 1960s into the late 1970s, Claridge was a voice actress credited with primarily providing police dispatch voice work for Adam-12 and also a few other television shows (i.e., Dragnet, Lou Grant and Columbo). Her voice work as the police dispatcher (\\"1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the man . . .\\") was featured in all but three episodes of Adam-12 (Elegy for a Pig, Hollywood Division and Clinic on Eighteenth Street). She was seen onscreen once in her role as a dispatcher in the fifth-season episode Suspended in which she has a brief conversation with Officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner). However, it appears that certain steps were taken to ensure that she wouldn't be recognized, such as the camera angles used in the sequence: when Milner first walks into the room, the camera is across said room and only her left profile is seen at a distance. But for the close-up, the camera is positioned above Claridge's head, over her left shoulder, and aimed down and diagonally to make it hard for the viewer to make out much in the way of her facial features. She is also said to have been wearing a wig for the scene . This was presumably done to protect Claridge due to her position as a real LAPD dispatcher, not a voice actress only. In the 1983 suspense/action movie Blue Thunder, starring Roy Scheider, Claridge's voice was again heard as an LAPD dispatcher in an uncredited role. She also voiced police dispatch in the 1970 Disney film \\"The Boatniks\\". Following Milner's death on September 6, 2015, Claridge broadcast the \\"End of Watch\\" transmission over the LAPD radio recognizing Milner's performance as Officer Pete Malloy in Adam-12. Marriages On January 12, 1963, she married Frank Walter Claridge. That marriage was later dissolved. On March 17, 1980, she wed Rodney Snead, to whom she remains married.

He is now remembered mostly for the three-volume collection of the works of William Blake he edited with W. B. Yeats. It is now criticised, however, for weak scholarship, and preconceptions. Life Ellis was a son of Alexander John Ellis. He was a long-term friend of John Butler Yeats, sharing an interest in aesthetics, and from 1869 a London studio in Newman Street; but was not on good terms with Susan his wife. Ellis was in an association with John Trivett Nettleship, and Sydney Hall, also followers of Blake, as well as John Butler Yeats and George Wilson (1848–1890, a Scottish Pre-Raphaelite inspired artist). Called The Brotherhood, the group was set up in 1869, with Hall leaving early. When the Yeats family moved to Bedford Park in London, which occurred in 1879, Ellis met the son William Butler Yeats. W. B. Yeats became close to the \\"vague and depressive\\" Ellis in 1888. Their joint study of Blake began in 1889, and resulted in a major textual discovery, the manuscript of Vala, or the Four Zoas. Ellis took part in the gatherings of the Rhymers' Club, and contributed to their anthologies. R. F. Foster describes his relationship to W. B.

Earlier in his career he was a Representative from Georgia and held several judicial positions. Robert Reid was born in Prince William Parish, Beaufort District, South Carolina, in 1789. He was educated at the University of South Carolina and studied and practiced law in Augusta, Georgia. Reid began public service at age 27 as a judge and later served Georgia as an at-large Representative from Georgia to the 15th, 16th, and 17th United States Congresses and served from February 18, 1819, to March 3, 1823. He also held several judicial positions including judge in the superior court of Georgia, circuit court judge for Middle Georgia, city judge for Augusta, Georgia. In May 1832, he was appointed United States judge for the district of East Florida by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. Reid's life was marked by personal tragedy. He married three times, was widowed twice and lost numerous children and grandchildren. With his first wife Anna Margaret McClaws, whom he married in 1811, Reid had five children: Janet, James, Florida, Rosalie, and Robert Raymond III. Anna Margaret McClaws died in 1825. Children Janet and James both drowned in a sailing accident in 1839. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Napier D. Randolph in 1829. She died in childbirth in 1832. In 1836, he married Mary Martha Reid, who later became known for her nursing work during the American Civil War. They had two sons, William and Reymond \\"Jenks.\\" U.S. President Martin Van Buren appointed Reid governor of Florida in December 1839. Reid presided at the convention that drafted Florida's first constitution and advocated a vigorous prosecution of the Second Seminole War. He died at his home in Blackwood near Tallahassee, Florida, on July 1, 1841, a victim of a yellow fever epidemic. His granddaughter Rebecca Black and daughter Janet Black were also victims of the 1841 yellow fever epidemic that struck Florida's Panhandle.

It was subsequently ported in Japan to the Nintendo GameCube, and then later to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows PCs. The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 2 by XS Games as Castle Shikigami 2, and in Europe as Castle Shikigami 2: War of the Worlds. XS Games also published the first game in the series in North America and Europe, but under the name of Mobile Light Force 2. Gameplay The game mechanisms are generally carried over from the original Shikigami No Shiro, with the addition of more playable characters. The game consists of five stages, each with two parts, with a boss at the end of each part. At the end of each stage, dialogue between the player character(s) and the bosses are shown in cut scenes; a unique sequence of dialogue is shown for every different character or combination of two characters. Each character has a primary weapon, used by tapping or holding one firing button; holding the button for more than a few seconds, however, will switch to the character's secondary \\"Shikigami\\" weapon. This tends to be more powerful, but limited in range or utility, and also slows character movement. Each character's weapons are different, sometimes dramatically, in terms of pattern and power; in addition, each Shikigami weapon is available in one of two modes, chosen at the start of each new game. Bombs are also available, and each character's bombs function differently as well. The leveling up of weapons from the original game is the only mechanic eliminated in the sequel. Five difficulty levels are available, for both the regular game and the \\"extreme mode\\", in which enemies release additional fire when destroyed. An alternate soundtrack, \\"S2MIX\\", consisting of rearranged music tracks from the first game, is also available; the original soundtrack has been completely replaced with brand new tracks in the PAL PS2 release, for undisclosed reasons. =Tension Bonus System= As with many shooters, the game places emphasis on obtaining high scores, which is facilitated by the Tension Bonus System (TBS). The TBS causes a player's score received to multiply, by factors of up to eight times, based on the player character's proximity to enemy bullets or enemies themselves; this is characteristic of the \\"grazing\\" mechanics found in games of the bullet hell genre. By staying close to hazardous objects, multipliers can be maintained for extended periods of time. In addition, destroyed enemies release coins that give extra points, which are also affected by the multiplier. The player's weapons also play a part in the TBS; when the multiplier is at maximum, the primary weapon increases in power and range for as long as this is maintained. In addition, coins released by enemies destroyed with the Shikigami weapon are automatically collected. Plot The backstory has the events of the game set in December 2006, as the castle of the title appears in the sky above Tokyo. In the beginning of the story, a giant castle appeared from above the city of Tokyo sometime during 2006. At 40 km, the ship-shaped castle was known as Nejireta castle. The battle between mankind and the gods is about to begin. =Characters= The game includes eight playable characters, including all five from the original; however, the secret character from the original has been removed. * Kohtarou Kuga (玖珂 光太郎) * Sayo Yuhki (結城 小夜) * Gennojo Hyuga (日向 玄乃丈) * Fumiko O.V. (Odette Vanstein) (ふみこ・オゼット・ヴァンシュタイン) * Kim Dae-jeong (金 大正) The two new characters are: * Niigi G.B. (Gorgeous Blue) (ニーギ・ゴージャスブルー) * Roger Sasuke (ロジャー・サスケ) The super deformed Fumiko also exists as a secret character. =Release= Due to the disparity in publishers, as well as release times, each port of the game has different cover artwork, and some releases contained additional content as well. The limited edition of the Dreamcast port included a soundtrack CD and trading cards (and even a telephone card with direct orders from Sega), the limited edition of the PlayStation 2 port included a figurine of Fumiko, and the limited edition of the Nintendo GameCube port included a figurine of Niigi and Neko, her cat. The North American release used original cover artwork based on the Japanese character designs, while the European release used yet another original image depicting an aerial dogfight. Within the game, new play modes were also introduced with new releases. New features added following the arcade version include story recollect mode, which allows cut scenes to be replayed, and gallery mode, a game artwork viewer. The Xbox port introduced practice mode, and, in a more significant addition, provided additional downloadable artwork and an online scoreboard, available through Xbox Live; this was one of the first examples of Xbox Live content exclusive to Japan, rather than North America. The American release, Castle Shikigami 2, was known for its Engrish dialogue, produced as a result of overly literal translation combined with stilted and generally unemotional voice acting. The dialogue for every character and two-character combination was dubbed into English, though exclamations made by characters during gameplay were not translated. Dialogues are not available at all in the PS2 PAL release. =Other media= A number of tie-in novels and manga volumes were produced, expanding the story of the game. *Novels: ** 玖珂家の秘密 (Secret of Kuga House) (2003, ) ** 陽の巻 (Book of Light) (2003, ) ** 陰の巻 (Book of Shade) (2003, ) ** Paradise Typhoon (2004, ) *Manga anthologies ** Anthology 1 (2003, ) ** Anthology 2 (2004, ) Magazine ZKC serialization compilations: ** Book 1, volume 1 (2004, ) ** Book 1, volume 2 (2004, ) ** Book 1, volume 3 (2005, ) ** Book 2, volume 1 (2005, ) ** Book 2, volume 2 (2005, ) ** Book 2, volume 3 (2006, ) ** Book 2, volume 4 (2006, ) Other products released, typical of Japanese video game franchises, include an art book, a standalone soundtrack CD, a set of illustrated telephone cards, plastic models of two of the characters, and the \\"Appreciate DVD\\", a disc of gameplay footage similar in concept to the Ikaruga Appreciate DVD. Sequels 2005 saw the release of Shikigami No Shiro: Nanayozuki Gensoukyoku, a spin-off adventure game in the visual novel style with shooting elements, as well as the arcade release of the proper sequel, Castle of Shikigami III, which expands the roster to nine or ten playable characters while removing two old characters.

Generally, Christians believe that the promised New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John includes the New Commandment. Based on the Bible teaching that, \\"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth\\", Protestants tend to believe that the New Covenant only came into force with the death of Jesus Christ. The commentary to the Roman Catholic New American Bible also affirms that Christ is the \\"testator whose death puts his will into effect\\". Christians thus believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the Blood of Christ shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant. There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant. For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the future external world as well. The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as in the statement: \\"this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\\". Christianity The key New Testament chapter for the Christian concept of the New Covenant is Hebrews chapter 8, a portion of which is quoted below: That full quotation, with partial quotations of the same text in other New Testament passages, reflects that the authors of the New Testament and Christian leaders generally, consider Jeremiah 31:31–34 to be a central Old Testament prophecy of the New Covenant. Here is the key text: Some Christians claim that there are many other passages that speak about the same New Covenant without using this exact wording. Some passages speak of a \\"covenant of peace\\",, , , others use other constructions; some simply say \\"covenant\\", but the context may imply that the New Covenant is at issue; and some claim metaphorical descriptions, for example that \\"Mount Zion\\" is really a metaphor for the New Covenant. =New Testament texts= The occurrence of the phrase \\"new covenant\\" varies in English translations of the Greek New Testament. The King James Version sometimes uses testament for covenant, with the words new covenant together only occurring in , and while in the New International Version \\"new covenant\\" occurs at , , , , and as a translation of some form of and or . Luke 22:17–20 (part of the Last Supper) is disputed. Six forms of the text have been identified; for example, the Western text-type such as Codex Bezae omit verses 19b–20.See Bruce M. Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament for details. The Daniel 9:27 commentary found in the 1599 Geneva Bible connects the verse with the New King James Version translation of Matthew 26:28. In this interpretation, the angel Gabriel reveals the coming New Blood Covenant of the Messiah, which is the fulfillment of the promise that through Abraham's seed all the nations would be blessed. (Galatians 3:16, 26-29)Who Confirmed the Covenant? http://christianmediaresearch.com/node/1023 =Christian view= Christians view the New Covenant as a new relationship between God and humans mediated by Jesus upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God. The New Covenant also breaks the generational curse of original sin on all children of Adam if they believe in Jesus Christ, after people are judged for their own sins, which is expected to happen with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. A dispensationalist Christian view of the nature of Israel is that God's promises to Israel are distinct from the Church. The Church, in this present age, is in no way a \\"spiritual Israel\\".C. C. Ryrie, Dispensationalism Today (Evanston, IL: Moody Press, 1973), p. 154. Cited in Hans K. LaRondelle, \\"Is the church spiritual Israel?\\" Ministry Magazine, September 1981. https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1981/09/is-the- church-spiritual-israel Some Christians, however, believe that the Church has inherited and absorbed God's promises to Israel, and that Israel is primarily a spiritual nation composed of Jews who claim Jesus as their Messiah, as well as Gentile believers who through the New Covenant have been grafted into the promises made to Israelites. This spiritual Israel is based on the faith of the patriarch Abraham (before he was circumcised) who was ministered by the Melchizedek priesthood, which is understood to be a type for the Christian faith of believing Jesus to be Christ and Lord in the order of Melchizedek. The Apostle Paul says that it is not \\"the children of the flesh\\" who are the children of God, but \\"the children of the promise\\". While Christ came as a priest in the order of Melchizedeck, which is to say without precedence, and fulfilled God's promise of a Messiah to the entire world whosoever believes, Dispensationalists believe that the body of God's promises concerning the future of Israel were to Israel alone, and should not be interpreted as being superimposed on the Church in the present age. God's remaining promises to Israel will come to fruition in the Millennium, the 1,000 year reign of Christ on Earth. =Membership= Among Christians, there are significant differences on the question of membership in the New Covenant. These differences can be so serious that they form a principal reason for division i.e., denominationalism. Christian denominations exist because of their answer to this question. The first major split is between those who believe that only believers are members of the New Covenant, and (reflecting the idea of the Jewish covenants as national or community covenants) those who believe that believers and their childrenThe reference here is to children that have not themselves made a profession of Christian faith. For those that hold the paedobaptist view, the reception of believers' children into the covenant, via baptism, typically happens before the child is even able to express faith (usually as an infant, hence the name). are members of the New Covenant. These differences give rise to different views on whether children may be baptised: the credobaptist view and the paedobaptist view. Secondarily, there are differences among paedobaptists as to the nature of the membership of children in the covenant. =Knowledge of God= Another difference is between those who believe the New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning a member of the New Covenant no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God). This division does not just break down along Jewish v. Christian lines (as the previous difference did). In general, those that are more likely to lean toward the \\"already view\\", or salvific knowledge view, are those Christians that do not believe in the indivisible Church (the indivisible Church is a belief of Catholics and Orthodox) and Christians that practice believer's baptism, because both believe the New Covenant is more present reality than future reality. Also in general, those that lean toward the \\"not yet view\\", or complete knowledge view, practice infant baptism for covenantal reasons, and dispensationalistic Christians (even though they tend to practice believer's baptism), because they believe the New Covenant is more future reality than present reality. =Christian supersessionism= Supersessionism is the view that the New Covenant replaces, fulfills or completes God's prior covenants with the Israelites. The most common alternatives to Supersessionism are abrogation of old covenant laws and dual covenant theology. Writers who reject the notion of supersessionism include Michael J. Vlach,Has the Church Replaced Israel?: A Theological Evaluation (B&H; Publishing Group 2010 ), p. 164 Walter Brueggemann,An Introduction to the Old Testament: the Canon and Christian Imagination (Westminster John Knox Press 2003 ), p. 189 and The Theology of the Book of Jeremiah(Cambridge University Press 2007 ), p. 191 Roland Edmund Murphy,101 Questions & Answers on the Biblical Torah: Reflections on the Pentateuch (Paulist Press 1996 ), p. 110 Jacques B. Doukhan.The Mystery of Israel Review and Herald Publishing Association 2004 Judaism Moses Speaks to the Children of Israel (illustration from Hartwell James's The Boys of the Bible) The only reference in the Hebrew Bible that uses the wording \\"new covenant\\" is found in : This prophet's word refers to the Messianic Age to come (or World to come), in which the eternal Mosaic covenant with Israel will be confirmed. Of this Mosaic covenant between God and Israel the Shabbat is declared to be the sign forever ().JewishEncyclopedia.com - COVENANT \\"Eternal as the covenant with heaven and earth is God's covenant with the seed of Jacob (Jer. xxxiii. 25 et seq.). Christianity, however, interpreted the words of the prophet in such a way as to indicate a new religious dispensation in place of the law of Moses (Heb. viii. 8–13).\\" The Tanakh describes Shabbat as having the purpose as a \\"taste\\" of Olam Haba (the world to come, the Hereafter) following the Messianic Age (the End of Days). The Jewish view of the mere wording \\"new covenant\\" is no more than a renewed national commitment to abide by God's laws. In this view, the word new does not refer to a new commitment that replaces a previous one, but rather to an additional and greater level of commitment.Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament : \\"The idea of the new covenant is based chiefly upon Jer. xxxi. 31–34 (comp. Heb. viii. 6–13, x. 16). That the prophet's words do not imply an abrogation of the Law is evidenced by his emphatic declaration of the immutability of the covenant with Israel (; comp. ); he obviously looked for a renewal of the Law through a regeneration of the hearts of the people.\\" Because Jews view the Mosaic covenant as applying only to Jews and any New Covenant merely a strengthening of the already existing one, Jews do not see this phrase as relevant in any way to non-Jews. For non-Jews, Judaism advocates the pre-Sinaitic Seven Laws of Noah. \\"Unlike Christianity, Judaism does not deny salvation to those outside of its fold, for, according to Jewish law, all non-Jews who observe the Noahide laws will participate in salvation and in the rewards of the world to come\\".The Torah, W. G. Plaut, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York, 1981; p. 71. In his 1962 work The Prophets Abraham Joshua Heschel points out that prophecy is not the only instrument of God to change the hearts of Israel, to know that he is God. He tells how the prophet Jeremiah complains that Israel is circumcised in body but \\"uncircumcised in heart\\" (9:26), that Jeremiah says \\"wash your heart from wickedness\\" (4:14). Heschel analyses that, while the prophet can only give Israel a new word, it is God himself who will give man a new heart: The \\"new covenant\\" will accomplish the complete transformation of every individual.Abraham J. Heschel, The Prophets, Harper Collins Publishers, New York, 2001; p.162ff. Compare with: The Jewish Encyclopedia's \\"New Testament\\" article states: It is mentioned several times in the Mishna and Talmud, and had been used extensively in kabbalistic literature due to the gematria value of 135 being equal to the word HaSinai (הסיני) in . Brit also has the numeric value of 612, which is suggested by some to mean that it is the \\"first\\" mitzvah which is true for the Jewish life cycle. The other use is in relationship to the merit of Ruth being an ancestor to King David, with the name again having same gematria as Brit, linking Davidic covenant with that of all previous, since Ruth was a Moabite by birth, and related to Noah also.

These three demands are often referred to as the \\"three Cs\\" of Roosevelt's Square Deal. Thus, it aimed at helping middle class citizens and involved attacking plutocracy and bad trusts while at the same time protecting business from the most extreme demands of organized labor. He explained in 1901-1909: > When I say that I am for the square deal, I mean not merely that I stand for > fair play under the present rules of the game, but that I stand for having > those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of > opportunity and of reward for equally good service. A progressive Republican, Roosevelt believed in government action to mitigate social evils, and as president he in 1908 denounced \\"the representatives of predatory wealth\\" as guilty of \\"all forms of iniquity from the oppression of wage workers to unfair and unwholesome methods of crushing competition, and to defrauding the public by stock-jobbing and the manipulation of securities.\\" During his second term, Roosevelt tried to extend his Square Deal further, but was blocked by conservative Republicans in Congress. Press usage of term =Earliest appearances= The press was using the term \\"Square Deal\\" as early as 1871 in a New York Times local news article that reads \\"Many of the inscriptions on the front of trucks, drays, and other vehicles are quite amusing. On one there is a picture of a hand containing four aces, and over it is inscribed square deal.\\" In 1888, in \\"letters from the people\\" (letters to the editor), one writer signed off as \\"Square Deal\\". In 1890, the phrase started to appear in headlines, e.g., \\"Give China a Square Deal\\" and \\"Not a Square Deal\\". =Roosevelt's usage in press= An early usage of \\"square deal\\" by Theodore Roosevelt in the press occurred in 1899, when The New York Times quoted his saying, \\"I did not appoint a man because he came from Dr. Wall's or any other church; I gave each man a square deal on his own account. That is what I mean by Americanism.\\" In 1901, he declared \\"a square deal for every man, big or small, rich or poor\\" during a speech in Lynn, Massachusetts, recorded by stereograph (photo) image. In a 1903 speech in Springfield, Illinois, he stated, \\"It seems to me eminently fitting that the guard around the tomb of Lincoln should be composed of colored soldiers. It was my own good fortune at Santiago to serve beside colored troops. A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.\\" In October 1904, while Roosevelt was readying publication of his book A Square Deal for Every Man (Chicago, R. J. Thompson, 1905), The New York Times reported: > No sooner have the Democrats concluded their task of going through the > President's many books with a fine-tooth comb to ferret out campaign > material, than Republicans come forth with a pamphlet of about the same > size, and prepared on a somewhat similar plan, making conspicuous Mr. > Roosevelt's sentiments on numerous civic and governmental questions.

Some imitate the form of proverbs. During 1905, Roosevelt capitalized on his slogan in the newspapers, who added \\"square deal\\" to headlines: * \\"A 'Square Deal' for the Negro\\" (January 17) about \\"negro suffrage\\" * \\"A Square Deal for the South\\" (January 27) * \\"Talks of Square Deal: President's Address at Press Club Banquet\\" (February 14) * \\"Upholds the President: Mormons Know He Will Give Them a Square Deal\\" (April 10) * \\"The 'Square Deal' Defined: President Offers Some Explanations of the Meaning of the Term\\" (April 15) * \\"The Square Deal\\" (May 18) The press praised Roosevelt's Square Deal: > His explanation of that is entirely plain and understandable. It > contemplates no injury to any interest, but an opportunity for all on > absolutely equal terms. That is a principle the justice of which is > universally recognized, and which ought to be more generally acknowledged in > this country than in any other. The press also criticized him for it: > In his insistence upon \\"a square deal for all,\\" President Roosevelt uses a > phrase which is as catchy and as impracticable as either of those > \\"glittering generalities\\" or the Declaration of Independence that have been > shining and ringing all over the civilized world for a hundred and twenty- > nine years and bid fair to serve for centuries to come as a potent > inspiration in every struggle against tyranny and oppression, every movement > toward greater liberty. Other politicians tried to capitalize on the phrase, too, e.g., U.S. Representative Henry Sherman Boutell of Illinois. Legislation In 1903, with Roosevelt's support, Congress passed the Elkins Act. This stated that railroads were not allowed to give rebates to favored companies any longer. These rebates had treated small Midwestern farmers unfairly by not allowing them equal access to the services of the railroad. The Interstate Commerce Commission controlled the prices that railroads could charge. Legislation was passed which specified that meat had to be processed safely with proper sanitation. Foodstuffs and drugs could no longer be mislabeled, nor could consumers be deliberately misled. Roosevelt gave high priority to environmental conservation, and safeguarded millions of acres of wilderness from commercial exploitation.Douglas Brinkley, The wilderness warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the crusade for America (2009). Roosevelt's conservation efforts were driven by practicality as well as by a love for nature. Influenced by early wise-use advocates like Gifford Pinchot, Roosevelt believed that nature existed to benefit humanity. In a conserved wilderness, water could be taken to irrigate farmland, sport could be had, and timber could be harvested. Acting on these beliefs, Roosevelt set up the federal Reclamation Service in 1902. The agency, through the use of dams and irrigation, created arable land in areas that had been too dry to farm, and the Reclamation Service eventually brought millions of acres of farmland into service. During Roosevelt's time in office, 24 reclamation projects were set up, and 150 national forests were created. Second term Roosevelt, moving to the left of his Republican Party base, called for a series of reforms that were mostly not passed. He sought a national incorporation law (all corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state). He called for a federal income tax, but the Supreme Court had ruled in 1895 that any income tax would require a constitutional amendment. Roosevelt sought an inheritance tax so the great family fortunes could not be inherited without tax for generations. In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes (injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business). He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws). He called for an eight-hour law for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a postal savings system to provide competition to local banks, and, finally, campaign finance reform. He secured passage of the Hepburn Act in 1906, which increased the regulating power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Eventually many of the proposals he championed were enacted under Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When Roosevelt ran for president on an independent Progressive Party ticket in 1912, in addition to these policies he proposed stringent new controls on the court system, especially state courts, to make them more democratic. His court policies in particular caused his anointed successor, William Howard Taft, to lead a counter-crusade that defeated Roosevelt in 1912.Stephen Stagner, \\"The Recall of Judicial Decisions and the Due Process Debate,\\" American Journal of Legal History 24#3 (1980), pp. 257-272 in JSTOR Labor Labor unions in the age of Samuel Gompers were generally on the Democratic side, but Roosevelt felt that favorable policies toward them would gain votes or at least neutralize their opposition.Stephen J. Scheinberg, \\"Theodore Roosevelt and the AF of L.'s entry into politics 1906–1908.\\" Labor History 3#2 (1962): 131-148. He had opposed unions in 1896, when they supported William Jennings Bryan, then came to appreciate their value after 1900. He played a central role in negotiating a compromise to end the Coal strike of 1902, which was threatening the nation's energy supply.Robert H.

Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect archaeological sites such as geomorphology, the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and artifacts post-deposition. Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying soil and sediments as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, geographic information systems (GIS) and digital elevation models (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences.Ghilardi, M. and Desruelles, S. (2008) “Geoarchaeology: where human, social and earth sciences meet with technology”. S.A.P.I.EN.S. 1 (2) Geoarchaeology is important to society because it informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediment, and rocks on the buried sites and artifacts they are researching. By doing this, scientists are able to locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how \\"prehistoric\\" they really are. Geoarchaeology is considered a sub- field of environmental archaeology because soil can be altered by human behavior, which archaeologists are then able to study and reconstruct past landscapes and conditions. Techniques used =Column sampling= Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a section for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions. =Loss on ignition testing= Loss on ignition testing for soil organic content – a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's horizons may not be visible in section and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an area's potential for prehistoric surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces. = Near-surface geophysical prospection = Geophysical archaeological prospection methods are used to non-destructively explore and investigate possible structures of archaeological interest buried in the subsurface. Commonly used methods are: * magnetometry * ground-penetrating radar * earth resistance measurements * electromagnetic induction measurements (including metal detection and magnetic susceptibility surveys) * sonar (sidescan, single-beam or multibeam sonar, sediment sonar) in underwater archaeology Less commonly used geophysical archaeological prospection methods are: * reflection or refraction seismic measurements * gravity measurements * thermography offset column sampling of the soil profile =Magnetic susceptibility analysis= The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for: * Site prospection, to identify areas of archaeological potential prior to excavation. * Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits. * Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging). The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to: * Identify buried soils in depositional sequences. * Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments etc. =Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry= Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62 kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650 g of (500 g–80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and 'fixed', where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150 kg ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn't take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different 'pools' in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating. Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the 'molybdate blue' reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart. Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape. =Particle size analysis= The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, gravel and sands, sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodium pyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, clays). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles. The results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters. The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples. =Trace element geochemistry= Trace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material. Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to \\"fingerprint\\" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact. =Clay mineralogy analysis= Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.Druca, I. C. and Q. H. J. Gwynb (1997), From Clay to Pots: A Petrographical Analysis of Ceramic Production in the Callejón de Huaylas, North-Central Andes, Peru, Journal of Archaeological Science, 25, 707-718. =Ostracod analysis= Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities. This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.^ Manuel R.

(a merchant banking firm) and has sat on the Board of Directors of Process Capital, Nordex Explosives and Oxygen and Prescott Paper Products, as well as the Mississauga Hospital Foundation. Peterson is the brother of two prominent Liberal politicians: former Premier of Ontario David Peterson and former federal cabinet minister Jim Peterson. He was the last of the three brothers to enter political life. Politics Peterson was elected in the 2003 provincial election as a Liberal in the riding of Mississauga South. He beat incumbent Progressive Conservative Margaret Marland by 234 votes. The Liberals under Dalton McGuinty formed a majority government and Peterson was named parliamentary assistant to Jim Bradley, the Ontario Minister of Tourism and Recreation. In 2006 he was appointed as parliamentary assistant to George Smitherman, the Ontario Health and Long-Term Care. On March 29, 2007, Peterson resigned from the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent. He felt the McGuinty was not paying enough attention to issues in his Mississauga riding. He stated that he would run as the PC candidate in the October 2007 election. Liberal party insiders claimed that Peterson was dissatisfied with not being given a cabinet position. Minister of Finance Greg Sorbara said, \\"It's just common knowledge around our caucus that Tim has been disappointed for quite some time about the role he had been assigned within our government.\\" On June 6, 2007, he officially joined the PC caucus. In June 2007, Peterson was acclaimed as the Ontario PC candidate for Mississauga South. However, his candidacy was not without controversy. The local riding association objected to the former Ontario Liberal member's nomination. They unsuccessfully tried to stop it.

This can involve an increase in muscle mass, fat deposits, excess fluids such as water or other factors. Weight gain can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.  Description  Weight gain occurs when more energy (as calories from food and beverage consumption) is gained than the energy expended by life activities, including normal physiological processes and physical exercise. If enough weight is gained due to increased body fat deposits, one may become overweight or obese, generally defined as having more body fat (adipose tissue) than is considered good for health. The Body Mass Index (BMI) measures body weight in proportion to height, and defines optimal, insufficient, and excessive weight based on the ratio. Having excess adipose tissue (fat) is a common condition, especially where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary. Overweight and obesity may increase the risk of several diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers, and may lead to short- and long-term health problems during pregnancy. Rates of obesity worldwide tripled from 1975 to 2016 to involve some 1.8 billion people and 39% of the world adult population. A commonly asserted \\"rule\\" for weight gain or loss is based on the assumption that one pound of human fat tissue contains about 3,500 kilocalories (often simply called calories in the field of nutrition). Thus, eating 500 fewer calories than one needs per day should result in a loss of about a pound per week. Similarly, for every 3500 calories consumed above the amount one needs, a pound will be gained. The assumption that a pound of human fat tissue represents about 3500 calories in the context of weight loss or gain is based on a review of previous observations and experiments by Max Wishnofsky published in 1958. He noted that previous research suggested that a pound of human adipose tissue is 87% fat, which equals 395 grams of fat. He further assumed that animal fat contains 9.5 calories per gram. Thus one pound of human fat tissue should contain 3750 calories. He then critically analyzed the relevant literature and applied a number of additional assumptions, including that the diet contains sufficient protein and that the person is in glycogen and nitrogen (protein) equilibrium, leading to most weight loss stemming from the catabolism of fat. He concluded that a 3500 calorie excess or deficit for a person meeting his assumptions, would lead to the gain or loss, respectively, of one pound of body weight. He noted that if the assumptions he made are not met, a deficit of 3500 calories would not necessarily equate to a pound of weight loss. Wishnofsky did not take into account numerous aspects of human physiology and biochemistry which were unknown at the time. The claim has achieved the status of a rule of thumb and is repeated in numerous sources, used for diet planning by dietitians and misapplied at the population level as well.  Causes  In regard to adipose tissue increases, a person generally gains weight by increasing food consumption, becoming physically inactive, or both. When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (when the body is in positive energy balance), the body can store the excess energy as fat. However, the physiology of weight gain and loss is complex involving numerous hormones, body systems and environmental factors. Other factors beside energy balance that may contribute to gaining weight include: = Social factors = A study, involving more than 12,000 people tracked over 32 years, found that social networks play a surprisingly powerful role in determining an individual's chances of gaining weight, transmitting an increased risk of becoming obese from wives to husbands, from brothers to brothers and from friends to friends. The human microbiota facilitates fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs, contributing to weight gain. A change in the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may determine host's risk of obesity. =Sleep and stress= Lack of sufficient sleep has been suggested as a cause for weight gain or the difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight. Two hormones responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism are leptin, which inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, and ghrelin, which increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Studies have shown that chronic sleep deprivation is associated with reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin, which together result in increased appetite, especially for high fat and high carbohydrate foods. As a result, sleep deprivation over time may contribute to increased caloric intake and decreased self-control over food cravings, leading to weight gain. =Hormone and neurotransmitter imbalances= Weight gain is a common side-effect of certain psychiatric medications. =Pathologies= Pathological causes of weight gain include Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, insulinoma, and craniopharyngioma. Genetic reasons can relate to Prader–Willi syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, Cohen syndrome, and Carpenter syndrome.  Effects  Excess adipose tissue can lead to medical problems; however, a round or large figure does not necessarily imply a medical problem, and is sometimes not primarily caused by adipose tissue. If too much weight is gained, serious health side-effects may follow. A large number of medical conditions have been associated with obesity. Health consequences are categorised as being the result of either increased fat mass (osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, social stigma) or increased number of fat cells (diabetes, some forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). There are alterations in the body's response to insulin (insulin resistance), a proinflammatory state and an increased tendency to thrombosis (prothrombotic state).

She is a two-time Olympic champion in the individual sabre (2004 and 2008) and the first American to win a gold medal in Olympic fencing. She was Team USA flag bearer in the 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. She has two Olympic bronze team medals in (2008 and 2016) and is a four-time Olympian (2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016).https://www.teamusa.org/usa-fencing/athletes/Mariel-Zagunis Biography Zagunis' parents, Robert and Cathy (née Menges) Zagunis, were collegiate rowers at Oregon State University and Connecticut College, respectively. They both competed with the U.S. rowing team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Her older brother Marten and younger brother Merrick also fence sabre. She grew up in Oregon and attended Valley Catholic from kindergarten to 12th grade, and the University of Notre Dame where she majored in anthropology. Zagunis is of Lithuanian descent by paternal side and was raised in the Catholic faith. Early career Zagunis was the first American fencer to hold the Jr. World Cup Champion title (2002), and she did so three years in a row (2002, 2003, 2004). She is the youngest fencer ever to win the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) World Championship gold, and the youngest fencer to win three FIE medals in one season. Zagunis won the FIE over-all medal three years in a row. She was the first fencer in the history of the sport to hold more than two World Champion titles in one season (2001: Cadet, Jr. and Jr. Team titles). She entered the University of Notre Dame in 2004 on an athletic scholarship. In October 2005, Zagunis won her seventh World Champion title at the Leipzig, Germany World Championships, in the women's team event. A year later at the 2006 World Fencing Championships she won the silver, after losing the final to Rebecca Ward. She is the second U.S. fencer in history to have won the World Cup total-points Title from the FIE. In 2009 Zagunis captured the last individual World title to have eluded her when she won the World Championships in Antalya, Turkey, defeating Ukrainian Olga Kharlan 15–6 in the final. She repeated as World Champion one year later, again winning the individual sabre title, defeating the Ukraine's Olga Khomrova 15–11 in the final. 2004 Athens Olympics The Women's Sabre event was being contested for the first time at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Zagunis did not directly qualify to fence in the tournament. However, Nigeria decided not to send their qualifying fencer to the tournament, and as the next highest seeded fencer in the world, Zagunis was selected to represent the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She received one of eight byes offered in the first round, entering the tournament in the Round of 16, where she defeated Japanese fencer Madoka Hisagae, 15–13. In the quarterfinals, she defeated Elena Jemayeva of Azerbaijan, 15–11. In the semifinals, Zagunis clinched at least a silver medal by defeating Romania's Cătălina Gheorghițoaia, 15–10. Zagunis faced Chinese fencer Xue Tan in the finals, defeating her 15–9 and becoming the first American to win an Olympic fencing gold medal in 100 years. Previously the only American Olympic fencing gold medalist was Albertson Van Zo Post. In the 1904 Summer Olympics he had been the gold medalist in the individual singlestick event and in the team foil event, where he had joined two Cuban fencers to make up a combined Cuba/U.S. team. Because fellow American Sada Jacobson had become the first U.S. woman to be ranked #1 in the world in women's sabre (in 2003), the US Fencing Association had touted Jacobson as the potential gold medalist in the 2004 games, especially at the Fencing Summer Nationals in Austin, Texas that same year. Zagunis' win as the underdog surprised the elite in the fencing world. (Jacobson earned the bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics.) 2008 Beijing Olympics =Individual Event= Zagunis entered the 2008 Summer Olympics seeded sixth. She received a bye in the first round, entering the tournament when there were 32 fencers remaining. She trailed at the break in her round of 32 match against Sandra Sassine 8–7, but scored eight of the last ten touches to win 15–10. She then defeated Bogna Jozwiak 15–13 in the Round of 16. She beat Bao Yingying in the quarterfinals, 15–9. Zagunis then faced her training partner from the Oregon Fencing Alliance, Rebecca Ward, in the semifinals and defeated her 15–11. In the gold medal match, Zagunis faced the other top seed in the tournament, Sada Jacobson, and won, 15–8. With Ward's victory in the bronze medal match, fencers from the USA had won all three medals in the individual event. =Team Event= In the women's sabre team event, the U.S. was heavily favored to win. Zagunis teamed up with Jacobson and Ward to defeat the South African team in the quarterfinals, 45–8. In the semifinals, they fenced the team from Ukraine. The Ukrainian side, seeded fifth in the tournament, defeated the U.S. team 45–39, denying them a gold medal, and placing them in the bronze medal bout against France. The U.S. team rebounded from their semifinal loss by defeating the French team 45–38 for the bronze medal. 2012 London Olympics On July 25, 2012, Zagunis was elected by Team USA to be the national flag bearer in the Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. Zagunis failed to win a medal at these games. She lost to South Korea’s Kim Jiyeon, 15–13; then lost to Ukraine's Olga Kharlan in the bronze medal match, 15–10 Outside the fencing arena On March 3, 2017, Zagunis was announced as one of 16 celebrities participating in a cooking competition on the Food Network TV series Chopped. She was featured in the \\"Star Power: Culinary Muscle\\" episode, alongside former NFL player LaMarr Woodley, former gold medalist figure skater Dorothy Hamill, and current female UFC fighter Paige VanZant. Zagunis was the second contestant eliminated from the competition in her heat.

In October 2003, as a member of the FIE ad hoc committee on saber fencing, Korfanty spearheaded the change with the International Fencing Federation (FIE) in the timing in which the lights for recording a touch fired. The change shortened the time in which the second light could fire (close out time) from 300 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds, 180 milliseconds faster than the previous rule. The change was implemented in October 2004, immediately following the Athens Olympics.

Lennon filled it with forty singles to accompany him on tour. John Lennon's Jukebox also refers to the compilation CD album closely based on the jukebox's musical contents. The jukebox surfaced in an auction of Beatles memorabilia at Christie's and was sold for £2,500 ($4,907) to Bristol-based music promoter John Midwinter. Midwinter spent several years restoring the box and researching the discs, which had been catalogued in Lennon's handwriting. As Midwinter's health began to deteriorate, he became anxious that a story of the jukebox and its music should feature in a documentary. Eventually, The South Bank Show broadcast a documentary on the jukebox in 2004 in which many of the represented artists, along with Sting, were interviewed. The project (which was commissioned only a few days after Midwinter died) was developed by Steve Day for the British television production company Initial, headed by Malcolm Gerrie, and commissioned by Melvyn Bragg. Album The 2004 Compilation album named John Lennon's Jukebox contains thirty-four of the singles' A-sides and seven of their B-sides. The album contains several songs that are believed to be part of John Lennon's original choice. The album is subtitled \\"a collection inspired by music from his own collection\\" and some of the songs on the album are different versions from the ones that could have been included in the jukebox. For instance, the version of \\"Some Other Guy\\" by The Big Three is not the one that was in the original jukebox; instead it is a mid-1970s recording by the same group in the style of the Richie Barrett original (including the use of an electric piano). =Disc one= # \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" by Wilson Pickett # \\"Rescue Me\\" by Fontella Bass # \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles # \\"My Girl\\" by Otis Redding # \\"1-2-3\\" by Len Barry # \\"Hi-Heel Sneakers\\" by Tommy Tucker # \\"The Walk\\" by Jimmy McCracklin # \\"Gonna Send You Back to Georgia\\" by Timmy Shaw # \\"First I Look at the Purse\\" by The Contours # \\"New Orleans\\" by Gary U.S. Bonds # \\"Watch Your Step\\" by Bobby Parker # \\"Daddy Rollin' Stone\\" by Derek Martin # \\"Short Fat Fannie\\" by Larry Williams # \\"Long Tall Sally\\" by Little Richard # \\"Hey!

Early life Madison Starke Perry was born in Lancaster County, South Carolina, the youngest child of Benjamin Perry and his wife Mary Starke. He attended South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. He moved to Florida at the age of 31, arriving in 1845 and helping to found the village of Rochelle in Alachua County. He acquired a plantation to cultivate cotton, the major commodity crop, and became a leader among the planters in Alachua County. He was elected in 1849 to represent the county in the Florida House of Representatives. The following year he was elected to the Florida Senate. Perry as governor Perry ran for and was elected governor in 1856, assuming office on October 5, 1857. As Florida's fourth governor, Perry helped bring about the settlement of a long-standing boundary dispute with Georgia and encouraged the building of railways in the state. During the years before the Civil War, Governor Perry foresaw the possibility that Florida might secede from the Union, and in 1858 he urged the reestablishment of the state's militia. Florida did secede three years later, on January 10, 1861. Perry then called for the evacuation of all federal troops from Florida, intending to replace them with the militia. Last years After his term as governor ended on October 7, 1861, Perry served as colonel of the 7th Florida Infantry Regiment until illness forced his resignation on April 30, 1863.

In the book, Priscilla talks about meeting Elvis Presley, their marriage, and the factors and issues that led to the couple's divorce. The book rights were purchased in 1987, and in 1988 it was made into a television movie written by Joyce Eliason, directed by Larry Peerce, and starring Dale Midkiff as Elvis and Susan Walters as Priscilla.  Elements in the story  =Memphis: Elvis' family and Graceland= Priscilla wrote that Elvis did not approve of his father Vernon's relationship with divorcee Dee Stanley and did not attend their wedding. After the marriage Elvis bought a home on Dolan Drive in Memphis where Vernon and his new wife resided. On the rare occasions Dee Stanley-Presley came to Graceland, Elvis did his best to at least be civil towards his stepmother. Priscilla describes how her father reluctantly allowed her to live in Memphis, Tennessee to be near Elvis. The initial arrangement was that Priscilla would live with Vernon and Dee while attending a Memphis Catholic school. Contrary to this arrangement, Priscilla gradually moved in with Elvis. =The nights with Elvis= Priscilla's descriptions of the nights she spent with Elvis before their marriage suggest that the star was not overtly sexual towards her. The couple kissed and engaged in petting, but Elvis always stopped the make-out sessions before it led to actual intercourse. While describing a \\"cleansing period\\" in Elvis's life, Priscilla claims that \\"Any sexual temptations were against everything he was striving for, and he did not wish to betray me, the girl waiting for him at home who was preparing to be his wife.\\" According to her account, Elvis told Priscilla that they had to wait until they were married before having sex. He said, \\"I'm not saying we can't do other things. It's just the actual encounter. I want to save it.\\" Priscilla adds, \\"Fearful of not pleasing him—of destroying my image as his little girl—I resigned myself to the long wait. Instead of consummating our love in the usual way, he began teaching me other means of pleasing him. We had a strong connection, much of it sexual. The two of us created some exciting and wild times.\\" =Daily life with Elvis= Priscilla notes that prescription drugs were present from the first time she visited Elvis in America. He took placidyls to get to sleep in ever-increasing doses. Elvis would wake up at his normal time around 4:00 in the afternoon, but would be groggy and irritable for a few hours from the heavy dose of pills. He then began taking Dexedrine in order to wake up. Elvis liked old movie classics revolving around family or struggles to survive in the world such as Les Misérables, Wuthering Heights, It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Skeffington, Miracle on 34th Street, Letter from an Unknown Woman and his favorite, The Way of All Flesh, the story of a self-sacrificing father. Priscilla also describes several episodes involving Elvis' explosive temper and his jealous nature; including the time he went into a rage and threatened to fire a male employee (Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling), who supposedly acted too \\"friendly\\" with Priscilla. =Affairs with other women= Conversely, she writes about Presley's double standard for his own behavior. His promiscuity with other women led to several confrontations. Priscilla says she was aware he had been dating Anita Wood, a girl from Memphis, when they first met in Germany and that he had continued the relationship for nearly two years following his discharge from the Army. When he asked Priscilla to move to Memphis he told her the relationship with Wood was over, but she describes later finding a packet of love letters from Wood in the attic at Graceland. However, according to Elvis's own words, he did not make love to Anita Wood the whole four years he was with her. \\"Just to a point,\\" he said, \\"then I stopped. It was difficult for her too, but that's just how I feel.\\" Presley admitted he had a number of affairs with some of the women who co-starred in his films, but all the relationships were before he met Priscilla and \\"meant nothing.\\" Nevertheless, she understood these affairs were going on while he was professing love to Anita Wood. In a televised interview on January 14, 2005, with Larry King on CNN's Larry King Live, Anita Wood said that following media reports of a girlfriend in Germany, Elvis \\"had me believing that she (Priscilla) was just a friend and her daddy was in the Army with him, and there was nothing to it whatsoever.\\" Priscilla also writes of other times she became suspicious of Elvis' faithfulness. One such time was when Elvis released \\"(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame\\", Priscilla wondered at that time if Elvis was dating a girl named Donna Marie. =The Ann-Margret affair= Of the many women involved with Elvis, the one whom Priscilla felt that her relationship with Elvis was most threatened by was actress/singer Ann-Margret, who co-starred with Elvis in the film Viva Las Vegas. In her book, Priscilla devotes four pages to the subject (175 to 178). There was a lot of publicity about a romance between Elvis and Ann-Margret during the 1963 filming, and in the following weeks when Elvis returned to record music and prepare for his next film. Despite his denials of an affair, Priscilla went to Los Angeles and stayed with him. Aware Priscilla was there, Ann-Margret took matters into her own hands and suddenly announced to the Los Angeles press that she was engaged to Elvis Presley. The news was picked up by every major newspaper in America and Elvis informed Priscilla that he and Colonel Tom Parker thought it best for her to \\"go back to Memphis till it calms down.\\" Outraged, Priscilla picked up a vase and hurled it across the room, screaming that Ann-Margret should \\"keep her ass in Sweden where she belongs.\\" But desperate to please him, she went back to Graceland the next day. Elvis returned two weeks later, admitted to the affair, but promised it was over. Of all the movie stars Elvis Presley worked with, Ann-Margret was the only one to attend his funeral. The very next line of Priscilla's book says that after the Ann-Margret ordeal she soon suspected there were other women. She began traveling with him but says she would still \\"get crazed with worry.\\" She was afraid that the moment she was away from him, another woman could slip in. Priscilla relates how her insecurities would lead her to imitate the other woman's appearance (changing her clothes, hairstyle and makeup), to hopefully please him. If she forcefully challenged Presley on her suspicions he would threaten to send her home to her parents. One such confrontation (over Shelley Fabares, another Presley film co-star) led to a screaming match where he told her to get out. Bags packed, chauffeur ready to take her to the airport, Elvis changed his mind at the last minute and she willingly stayed. (In the TV movie, the confrontation was portrayed over the Ann-Margret affair, not over Fabares as written in the book). Priscilla writes that it was years later before she realized his tactics were part of a need to control her. This pattern began before they were married, but in her 2005 made-for-television documentary titled Elvis by the Presleys, she admitted he had affairs with other women during their marriage. =The Beatles' shadow, mysticism and drugs= By 1965, The Beatles had overwhelmed the music industry and Presley’s record sales declined noticeably. Uncertain about who he was and where his career was going, Elvis turned to spiritualism, dragging an uninterested Priscilla with him. He had not performed live for several years and labeled most of his movies a joke. By the time filming was to begin on Clambake (released 1967), Presley's growing distress with the quality of his films led to a despondency accompanied by overeating and his normal 170 pound (77 kg) weight ballooned to 200 lb (91 kg). The movie studio ordered him to lose the weight in a hurry, marking the introduction of diet pills to the already excessive regimen of placidyls and Dexedrine which would eventually kill him. In his search for a \\"higher state of consciousness\\" Presley became fascinated with the occult and metaphysical phenomena. During his spiritual quest everyone around them saw Presley's personality change dramatically from vibrant and playful, to passive and introverted. Presley went through a period of celibacy, in keeping with the teachings of an Indian guru. \\"He was going through a cleansing period, physically and spiritually... He loved me and deeply wanted to be faithful to me but never felt certain that he could resist temptation. It was a persistent battle, and it even got to the point where he felt he had to resist me.\\" For the next few weeks, Elvis felt the need to withdraw himself from the temptations of sex. He said, \\"We have to control our desires so they don't control us. If we can control sex, then we can master all other desires.\\" When they were in bed, \\"he took his usual dose of sleeping pills, handed me mine, and then, fighting off drowsiness from the pills, pored over his metaphysical books.\\" Priscilla was not interested, and recalled Elvis saying \\"Things will never work out between us, Cilla, because you don't show any interest in me or my philosophies.\\" When this phase of his life passed, she and Elvis had a bonfire and burned the stacks of magazines and books he had accumulated on the subject. They tried marijuana during this time, but did not like it as it made them ravenously hungry. Although Presley abhorred street drugs, Priscilla tells how they used LSD. While they both thought it had been an \\"extraordinary experience,\\" they were afraid of it and experimented that one time only. =Marriage, family, and the Nancy Sinatra factor= Elvis and Priscilla were married on May 1, 1967 in Las Vegas, Nevada. She wrote that being called \\"Mrs. Elvis Presley\\" sounded better than live-in Lolita, teen heartthrob or the other labels given her in the past by some of the press. After the wedding ceremony, Frank Sinatra's private jet flew them to their Palm Springs, California home. Being the romantic that he was, Elvis carried his new bride across the threshold singing \\"The Hawaiian Wedding Song\\", then carried her straight to the bedroom. After a second wedding reception at Graceland for friends and Memphis locals, Elvis and Priscilla went to his ranch near Horn Lake, Mississippi where they locked themselves away for several days of much needed privacy. However, the press and the curious lined a fence on the property's perimeter and stood on the tops of cars to take photos. Elvis Presley and Priscilla with newborn Lisa Marie, February 1968 While they planned on having children, Elvis and Priscilla had hoped to wait awhile, and Priscilla was not prepared for her pregnancy. She considered an abortion, in part because Elvis had made derogatory comments in the past about \\"women using pregnancy as an excuse to let themselves go.\\" Feeling insecure, she dieted to the point that by the time she gave birth, she then weighed less than she had before becoming pregnant. During Priscilla's pregnancy, she and Elvis made love passionately until she began hearing rumors about Elvis and Nancy Sinatra, his co-star in the film Speedway. When Priscilla confronted Elvis about the stories he dismissed them out of hand, telling her she was being overly sensitive due to her \\"condition\\" (pregnancy). However, six months into her pregnancy, Nancy Sinatra telephoned Priscilla and said she wanted to give her a baby shower. Priscilla was apprehensive about such a request coming from a woman she hardly knew, but Elvis convinced her to accept the offer. Priscilla went along with it and she and Sinatra got along well together. Everything seemed fine until a week or so later, when Elvis informed Priscilla that he needed time to think and wanted a trial separation. Devastated, all she could say was: \\"You've got it. Just tell me when to leave.\\" She lived in agony for days, but Elvis changed his mind without ever saying a thing. Two months later, their daughter Lisa Marie was born in Memphis on February 1, 1968. =The '68 Comeback Special to the end= Free to shape his own career after the MGM motion picture contract expired in 1968, although still required to complete two more films, Presley accepted an offer from the NBC network to do a television special. NBC executives offered \\"open development\\" along with a young director named Steve Binder, who was receptive to presenting Presley in a way he could be himself. Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special was an enormous success, the highest-rated television special of the year and his closing song titled \\"If I Can Dream\\" became his first million-selling record in several years. The television special motivated Elvis and he began recording at the American Sound Studios in Memphis owned by Chips Moman. Filled with new energy, he recorded so many songs, that RCA Records needed a year and a half to release them all. Included in these sessions were hits such as \\"Suspicious Minds\\" which went to No.1 on the Billboard Charts, \\"In the Ghetto\\" and \\"Kentucky Rain.\\" He was signed on to perform for a month at the then-new and just-completed International Hotel in Las Vegas. Every show was sold out with thousands being turned away at the door. This success led to a five-year contract for appearances twice a year, with the largest fee ever paid to any singer in history. Unfortunately, his renewed popularity brought a large increase in the number of death threats, requiring a significant increase in personal security. After years of personal unhappiness due to the state of his career, for a time his triumphant return to a live stage brought new vitality to their marriage. However, the renewed stardom, with regular touring around the United States and appearances in Las Vegas, meant he was away from his family more, and renewed the problem of other women in his life. When Elvis suggested Priscilla cut back on her visits to see him, it only added to her anxieties. Things grew worse when she returned to their Palm Springs home and found a number of letters from girls showing they had obviously been there. Priscilla Presley admits she had two affairs of her own, and the up and down marriage was irreparably broken down by 1972. The last straw came when Elvis, possibly having learned of the second affair with her karate instructor Mike Stone, forced himself on her in his Las Vegas hotel room, telling her, \\"This is how a real man makes love to a woman.\\" Separated on February 23, 1972, the Presleys divorced amicably on October 9, 1973, mutually agreeing to share custody of their daughter. Elvis had made another televised special called Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii in January 1973, but after not seeing him for several months prior to the actual court hearing, Priscilla was bewildered by his physical appearance. She remarked on how swollen his hands were when she held them in hers. Less than four years later, Elvis died. After his death, his father Vernon agreed to have Elvis's body reburied to deter thieves. A different view in Suzanne Finstad's book In Suzanne Finstad's book, Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley (1997), a completely different account of Priscilla Presley's life, painted her in a rather negative light and described her as a \\"wild child\\" and \\"sexpot\\". The sources of this book are several people who knew Elvis and Priscilla well, among them: many friends from Priscilla's childhood and adolescence, Elvis' stepbrother Rick Stanley, Mike Edwards, Elvis' ex- girlfriends and the wives of the Memphis Mafia men. The author writes that Priscilla promised sexual favors in exchange for meeting Elvis with Currie Grant, a married, 27-year-old former Army buddy of the singer, and that she was not a virgin on her wedding night, as she and Elvis had slept together on their second date. The book also says that Priscilla did not want to come to live with Elvis, but that her marriage was part of a mastermind for fame hatched by Priscilla and her mother, and that she never loved Elvis. Finstad takes many quotes that Priscilla has made and calls them a web of lies. Priscilla denied Currie's allegations and successfully sued him for defamation.\\"Elvis' Widow Wins Defamation Suit\\" CNN.com August 26, 1998 She won more than £46,000 in the lawsuit. She had wanted £6m from Grant.. Finstad, \\"too, had been threatened with suits from Priscilla Presley and her church (of Scientology).\\". Notwithstanding, neither Finstad nor her publisher was a party to the lawsuit. Personal Jesus The song \\"Personal Jesus\\" by Depeche Mode (#368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \\"The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".) was inspired by Elvis and Me..

It is composed of mudstone, sandstone, siltstone, and limestone and is light gray, greenish gray, or red. Most of the fossils occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones, relics of the rivers and floodplains of the Jurassic period. It is centered in Wyoming and Colorado, with outcrops in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Equivalent rocks under different names are found in Canada. It covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles), although only a tiny fraction is exposed and accessible to geologists and paleontologists. Over 75% is still buried under the prairie to the east, and much of its western paleogeographic extent was eroded during exhumation of the Rocky Mountains. It was named after Morrison, Colorado, where the first fossils in the formation were discovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877. That same year, it became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. In Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, the Morrison Formation was a major source of uranium ore.  Description  = Geologic history = According to radiometric dating, the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3 ± 2 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 ± 1 million years old at the top, which places it in the earliest Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the late Jurassic. This is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. The age and much of the fauna is similar to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal.Mateus, O. 2006. Late Jurassic dinosaurs from the Morrison Formation, the Lourinhã and Alcobaça Formations (Portugal), and the Tendaguru Beds (Tanzania): a comparison. in Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S. G. R.M., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36: 223-231. Throughout the western United States, it variously overlies the Middle Jurassic Summerville, Sundance, Bell Ranch, Wanakah, and Stump Formations. At the time, the supercontinent of Laurasia had recently split into the continents of North America and Eurasia, although they were still connected by land bridges. North America moved north and was passing through the subtropical regions. The Morrison Basin, which stretched from New Mexico in the south to Alberta and Saskatchewan in the north, was formed during the Nevadan orogeny, a precursor event to later orogenic episodes that created the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east- facing drainage basins, carried by streams and rivers from the Elko Highlands (along the borders of present-day Nevada and Utah) and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains, became the Morrison Formation. In the north, the Sundance Sea, an extension of the Arctic Ocean, stretched through Canada down to the United States. Coal is found in the Morrison Formation of Montana, which means that the northern part of the formation, along the shores of the sea, was wet and swampy, with more vegetation. Aeolian, or wind-deposited sandstones, are found in the southwestern part, which indicates it was much more arid—a desert, with sand dunes. = Stratigraphy = In the Colorado Plateau region, the Morrison Formation is further broken into four sub-divisions, or members. From the oldest to the most recent, they are: Bluish beds of the Brushy Basin Member containing alkali minerals deposited in Lake T'oo'dichi' Reddish mudstones of the Tidwell Member underlying the whitish sandstones of the Saltwash Member, south of Cisco, Utah. Brushy Basin Member on the Colorado Plateau \\"Popcorn\\" texture due to bentonite, formed from volcanic ash, characterizes the Brushy Basin Member # Windy Hill Member: The oldest member. At the time, the Morrison basin was characterized by shallow marine and tidal flat deposition along the southern shore of the Sundance Sea. # Tidwell Member: The Sundance Sea receded to Wyoming during this member and was replaced by lakes and mudflats. # Salt Wash Member: The first purely terrestrial member. The basin was a semi-arid alluvial plain, with seasonal mudflats. # Brushy Basin Member: Much finer- grained than the Salt Wash Member, the Brushy Basin Member is dominated by mudstone rich in volcanic ash. Rivers flowed from the west into a basin that contained a giant, saline alkaline lake called Lake T'oo'dichi' and extensive wetlands that were located just west of the modern Uncompahgre Plateau. In the San Juan Basin, there is an additional Jackpile Sandstone Member above the Brushy Basin Member. This is primarily a whitish crossbedded subarkose sandstone with a clay matrix. It is interbedded with variegated, pale-green to red, bentonitic mudstone lenses. Deposition in the Morrison Formation ended about 147 Ma. The latest Morrison strata are followed by a thirty-million-year gap in the geologic record. The overlying units are the Lower Cretaceous Cedar Mountain, Burro Canyon, Lytle, and Cloverly Formations.  Fossil content  Though many of the Morrison Formation fossils are fragmentary, they are sufficient to provide a good picture of the flora and fauna in the Morrison Basin during the Kimmeridgian. Overall, the climate was dry, similar to a savanna but, since there were no angiosperms (grasses, flowers, and some trees), the flora was quite different. Conifers, the dominant plants of the time, were to be found with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetail rushes. Much of the fossilized vegetation was riparian, living along the river flood plains. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and mammaliforms. The dinosaurs were most likely riparian, as well. Hundreds of dinosaur fossils have been discovered, such as Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus, Saurophaganax, Camptosaurus, Ornitholestes, several stegosaurs comprising at least two species of Stegosaurus and the slightly older Hesperosaurus, and the early ankylosaurs, Mymoorapelta and Gargoyleosaurus, most notably a very broad range of sauropods (the giants of the Mesozoic era). Since at least some of these species are known to have nested in the area (Camptosaurus embryoes have been discovered), there are indications that it was a good environment for dinosaurs and not just home to migratory, seasonal populations. However, the large body mass of the sauropods has been interpreted as an adaptation to migration in times of drought. Sauropods that have been discovered include Diplodocus (most famously, the first nearly complete specimen of D. carnegii, which is now exhibited at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Camarasaurus (the most commonly found sauropod), Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus, Brontosaurus, Barosaurus, the uncommon Haplocanthosaurus and Supersaurus. The very diversity of the sauropods has raised some questions about how they could all co-exist. While their body shapes are very similar (long neck, long tail, huge elephant-like body), they are assumed to have had very different feeding strategies, in order for all to have existed in the same time frame and similar environment. = Sites and quarries = Workers inside the Dinosaur Quarry building, at the Dinosaur National Monument Locations where significant Morrison Formation fossil discoveries have been made include:  Colorado  Fruita Paleontological Resource Area. One of the sites is denoted by the arrow. * Garden Park, Colorado: One of the three major sites excavated by the paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope during the Bone Wars in 1877, though most of the specimens were too incomplete to classify (nomina dubia). In 1992, a specimen of Stegosaurus stenops was discovered with its armor still in place, which confirmed that the dinosaur had two rows of plates on its back. * Dry Mesa Quarry, Colorado: A wide variety of fauna, as well as the most diverse set of dinosaurs from any Morrison Formation quarry. The first dig was in 1972, by researchers from Brigham Young University. Unique specimens include the longest dinosaur known, Supersaurus, the chimeric Ultrasauros, and the largest carnivore on the continent, Torvosaurus. * Fruita Paleontological Resource Area: Badlands sites located south of Fruita, were actively worked by George Callison from California State University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Numerous specimens of mammals, lizards, and crocodiles were found. Most recently, Fruitafossor windscheffelia and the new dinosaur Fruitadens were described from the area. * Purgatoire River track site, Otero County.  Utah  * Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Utah: First excavated by geologists from the University of Utah in the late 1920s. William Lee Stokes led an expedition from Princeton in 1939. During the Jurassic, the quarry was a mudhole where several enormous sauropods got stuck and apparently caused a feeding frenzy that lured and trapped many carnivorous dinosaurs. Most of the allosaurs are from this site, as well as the unique Stokesosaurus and Marshosaurus. * Dinosaur National Monument, Utah: First excavated by Earl Douglas working for the Carnegie Museum in 1909 with the purpose of finding sauropods from the Morrison Formation for public display. Monument also has fossilized dinosaurs from the Cedar Mountain Formation. * Hanksville-Burpee Quarry, Hanksville  Wyoming  * Bone Cabin Quarry, Wyoming * Como Bluff, Wyoming: One of the most renowned fossil sites in North America. It was first worked by Cope and particularly Marsh in 1877 and has been the source of many different sauropods and non-dinosaur species. The Cloverly Formation from the Cretaceous and some Triassic strata are also exposed at this location. * The Wyoming Dinosaur Center, Thermopolis * Ten Sleep, including Dana Quarry from where at least 12 sauropods and theropods are recovered.Saleiro, A., & Mateus O.

He was the 27th Governor of Wisconsin and 29th Governor of Wisconsin, as well as one of the founders of the Wisconsin Progressive Party. Early life and family La Follette was born in Madison, Wisconsin, a member of the politically prominent La Follette family. He was the son of Wisconsin Congressman, Governor, and U.S. Senator Robert M. \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette, Sr., and Belle Case La Follette, brother of U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr., brother of Fola La Follette, whose husband was the playwright George Middleton, and uncle of Wisconsin Attorney General Bronson La Follette. La Follette served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Infantry in 1918, during World War I. In 1919 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Wisconsin and in 1922 a Bachelor of Laws degree. He married Isabel Bacon (1898-1973) in 1923. They had three children. Son Robert (c. 1927), and daughters Judith (c. 1929) and Sherry (1936). Political career He was the district attorney for Dane County, Wisconsin, from 1925 to 1927. La Follette was Governor of Wisconsin from 1931 to 1933 and 1935 to 1939. He was first elected as a progressive member of the Republican Party in the 1930 election. After a defeat in the 1932 Republican Primary, however, La Follette, along with his brother, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., created the Wisconsin Progressive Party and both ran successfully under its ticket in 1934. The gregarious governor was known as \\"Phil\\" on the streets of Madison during his governorship, much as his father had been known as simply \\"Bob.\\" His governorship saw the implementation of many of the progressive measures of the New Deal, with La Follette being responsible for the implementation of some of them on the state level before the Roosevelt Administration could do so on the national level. La Follette was defeated seeking reelection as governor in 1938. That spring he had attempted to launch the National Progressive Party of America in an attempt to create a national third party (as the La Follettes had helped create in Wisconsin) in anticipation of Franklin D. Roosevelt not seeking a third term for President. The plan for a new national Progressive Party never materialized at the time, and Roosevelt soon decided to defy convention and precedent and seek a third term; La Follette never again sought public office for himself. Later life and career Much as his father opposed U.S. entry into World War I, Phil La Follette strongly opposed, like most other Americans, U.S. entry into World War II. Once war was declared, he abandoned his opposition and joined the U.S. Army, serving on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He would later spearhead a slate of delegates to the 1948 Republican National Convention supporting MacArthur's nomination for the presidency. From 1955 to 1959, La Follette served as president of Hazeltine Electronics, and made his home in Douglaston, New York. He later returned to Wisconsin, wrote his autobiography, and was active in the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. He died in Madison, Wisconsin.

Early life Born in Budapest, Hungary, Elthes earned a degree in law from University of Budapest in 1936. In 1956, political turmoil in Hungary caused him to leave his wife and two daughters and flee to the west via the Brücke von Andau. He arrived in the United States and was detained for sixty days. In the USA Determining that he would not be able to find work as a lawyer in the United States, he decided that fencing might be a good way to make a living. Investigating the competitions of the time, he realized that while American foil fencing was already at a fairly high level (he cited Albie Axelrod and Daniel Bukantz in particular), there were opportunities in sabre and epee, and he quickly found employment at the salle of maestro Giorgio Santelli in New York City. Elthes and Santelli were largely (but not solely) responsible for making the New York City area the center of US sabre fencing for most of their careers; Elthes was a US Olympic coach from 1964 to 1984, and as late as 1992, the entire US Olympic sabre team was based at NYC salles and clubs. Elthes generally gave lessons both at the Fencers Club and at the New York Athletic Club. For at least three years (1968-1971) he was the fencing coach at Pace University. Teaching style In his teaching, Elthes stressed balance and footwork, and treated fencing as an intellectual pursuit as well as an athletic one. When teaching, he often gave very few verbal instructions, indicating that the student should attempt to strike by exposing a potential target, or illustrating the weakness of a student's attack with a well-placed stop-cut. The Hungarian school of instruction practiced by Elthes was famed for discipline, sarcasm and competitiveness, but always making it clear that there was respect between teacher and student (as exemplified by Elthes frequently calling students \\"Mr. Sir\\" (pronounced \\"Meester Sore\\" due to his heavy Hungarian accent), which tended to create fierce loyalty. Students got more instructor time the better their performance. Former student and longtime friend of Elthes, Robert Blum noted \\"Occasional verbal insults were received as gratuities!\\" Personal courage and disregard for discomfort were also part of the formula; for very advanced students, Elthes sometimes gave lessons without a mask, and nearly all serious students were disciplined by being hit with a sabre, sometimes hard enough to draw blood; Danny Bukantz' son Jeff, a student from the 1970s, notes \\"I think I may have been the only student that Csaba didn't hit. I always thought it might have been because my father was his dentist\\". Peter Westbrook quit working with Elthes after three months in 1972, unwilling to tolerate the maestro's teaching style. The following year, Westbrook began working with Elthes again, and Elthes no longer struck him, coaching him to his first of 13 US National Sabre titles in 1974. Of him, Westbrook wrote; > \\"Csaba believed in me and worked me like a dog, goading me, inspiring me, > always pushing me beyond what I thought I could or would do. I was lucky to > have had 8 years with Csaba in his prime before his stroke in 1980. The > stroke paralyzed his right hand so he taught w/his left until he recovered > some use in his right.

In 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow. Elthes and the US Fencing team instead went on a state department sponsored trip to China, spending 3 weeks traveling through 4 different provinces competing against China's top teams. Later that year, Elthes suffered a stroke, paralyzing his right hand, but he learned to teach with his left until he had recovered some use of the right, and switched hands as needed for the rest of his career. In 1981, his student Michael Lofton becomes US Junior Olympic sabre champion, beginning a very successful career as one of the United States' top fencers. His passion for fencing and competition never wavered; in 1994, he convinced Peter Westbrook to train for and participate in the 1995 Pan American Games, where Westbrook won a gold medal at the age of 42. Elthes died of a stroke in 1995 when visiting his home city of Budapest. He was survived by his second wife, Baba, who resides in New York. Among Elthes' students are US Olympic competitors Marty Lang, Al Morales, Paul Apostol, Westbrook, Mika'il Sankofa (formerly Michael Lofton), Steve Mormando, and Jeff Bukantz, as well as Olympic fencing referee (certified at a record-setting age 18) and Maccabiah Games medalist Russell Wilson.

Instant-on technology is today mostly used on laptops, netbooks, and nettops because the user can boot up one program, instead of waiting for the PC's operating system to boot. This allows a user to launch a single program, such as a movie-playing program or an internet browser, without the need of the whole operating system. There still remain a few true instant-on machines such as the Atari ST, as described in the Booting article. These machines had complete Operating Systems resident in ROM similar to the way in which the BIOS function is conventionally provided on current computer architectures. The \\"instant-on\\" concept as used here results from loading an OS, such as a legacy system DOS, with a small hard drive footprint. Latency inherent to mechanical drive performance can also be eliminated by using Live USB or Live SD flash memory to load systems at electronic speeds which are orders of magnitude faster.

Pros and cons An instant-on operating system is like those used by 1980s home computers such as the Commodore 64. This offers many advantages over a standard modern operating system: * faster booting; * less vulnerable to malware as the system is mostly read-only; * allows for diskless computers; * lighter; * lower power consumption. However, this comes at the price of having limited local functionality, while focusing on web / cloud services. Consumer electronics In the past, consumer electronics manufacturers would emblazon radios and television sets with \\"Instant On\\" or \\"Instant Play\\" decals. In series filament sets, instant-on was accomplished by adding only a silicon diode across the power switch to keep tube filaments lit at 50% power; the diode was placed such that the typical half wave rectifier of the day was reverse-biased. Instant-on advantages included near-instant operation of the television or radio and potentially longer vacuum tube life; disadvantages included energy consumption and risk of fire. Most solid state consumer electronics are inherently instant-on, so the moniker survived into the early solid state era to differentiate a product from its vacuum-tube based brethren (with CRTs being a notable exception).

Formally, the Turing machine has two tapes, one of which encodes the input and can only be read, whereas the other tape has logarithmic size but can be read as well as written. Logarithmic space is sufficient to hold a constant number of pointers into the input and a logarithmic number of boolean flags, and many basic logspace algorithms use the memory in this way. Complete problems and logical characterization Every non-trivial problem in L is complete under log-space reductions,See , Theorem 7.13 (claim 2), p. 179. so weaker reductions are required to identify meaningful notions of L-completeness, the most common being first-order reductions. A 2004 result by Omer Reingold shows that USTCON, the problem of whether there exists a path between two vertices in a given undirected graph, is in L, showing that L = SL, since USTCON is SL-complete. One consequence of this is a simple logical characterization of L: it contains precisely those languages expressible in first-order logic with an added commutative transitive closure operator (in graph theoretical terms, this turns every connected component into a clique). This result has application to database query languages: data complexity of a query is defined as the complexity of answering a fixed query considering the data size as the variable input. For this measure, queries against relational databases with complete information (having no notion of nulls) as expressed for instance in relational algebra are in L. Related complexity classes L is a subclass of NL, which is the class of languages decidable in logarithmic space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. A problem in NL may be transformed into a problem of reachability in a directed graph representing states and state transitions of the nondeterministic machine, and the logarithmic space bound implies that this graph has a polynomial number of vertices and edges, from which it follows that NL is contained in the complexity class P of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time., Corollary 8.21, p. 299. Thus L ⊆ NL ⊆ P. The inclusion of L into P can also be proved more directly: a decider using O(log n) space cannot use more than 2O(log n) = nO(1) time, because this is the total number of possible configurations. L further relates to the class NC in the following way: NC1 ⊆ L ⊆ NL ⊆ NC2. In words, given a parallel computer C with a polynomial number O(nk) of processors for some constant k, any problem that can be solved on C in O(log n) time is in L, and any problem in L can be solved in O(log2 n) time on C. Important open problems include whether L = P, and whether L = NL., p. 297; , p. 180. It is not even known whether L = NP.https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/103073/is-it-possible-that-l-np The related class of function problems is FL. FL is often used to define logspace reductions. Additional properties L is low for itself, because it can simulate log-space oracle queries (roughly speaking, \\"function calls which use log space\\") in log space, reusing the same space for each query. Other uses The main idea of logspace is that one can store a polynomial-magnitude number in logspace and use it to remember pointers to a position of the input. The logspace class is therefore useful to model computation where the input is too big to fit in the RAM of a computer. Long DNA sequences and databases are good examples of problems where only a constant part of the input will be in RAM at a given time and where we have pointers to compute the next part of the input to inspect, thus using only logarithmic memory.

Examples of this can include twitching or spastic tendencies, which are indicative of upper motor neuron disease as well as the lessening or loss of control ordinarily exerted by higher brain centers of lower neural pathways (disinhibition). See Autonomic dysreflexia. The most common cause of hyperreflexia is spinal cord injury (see autonomic dysreflexia). Standard stimuli like the filling of the bladder can cause excessive responses from the nervous system, such causes are not known. But hyperreflexia can be developed via many other causes, including medication and stimulant side effects, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, serotonin syndrome, severe brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, Reye syndrome, and preeclampsia. Treatment depends on diagnosing the specific pathology causing this symptom. Should it be caused by use of stimulants or other substances, then it may involve removing these drugs from use. Recovery of hyperreflexia can occur between several hours to several months after a spinal cord injury; however, the phase of recovery is likely to occur in stages rather than on a continuum.Little, J., Ditunno, J. F., Stien, S., A., Harris, R. M. (1999). Incomplete spinal cord injury: Neuronal mechanisms of motor recovery and hyperreflexia. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 80(5): 587-599. The late stage can be defined as between two weeks and several months. Individuals with a severe spinal cord injury (SCI) mainly present with a later stage of recovery because during the early stages they present with spinal shock.

He studied at famous Italian schools, including the Scuola Magistrale of Rome (Scuola Magistrale Militare di Roma), where he graduated in 1889.Gaugler, William M. The History of Fencing: Foundations of Modern European Swordplay. Laureate Press, 1998, p. 217. In 1896 Santelli was considered an established fencing master, and Santelli moved to Budapest together with brother Otello, also a fencer, and his wife. Santelli had his son, Giorgio, in Hungary in 1897, who always kept his Italian citizenship, before leaving for the USA. It was in Hungary that Italo Santelli began to create a new style of sabre fencing. The style involved a much more quick defense than classical training called for, and became known as the \\"modern style\\" of Santelli. Santelli displayed this modern style at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris on the Italian team. He came in 6th at the foil competition, but took home a silver medal in sabre, his teammate Antonio Conte taking the gold. He later coached George Worth, born Gyorgy Woittitz, the Hungarian-born American Olympic medalist fencer, in Budapest. Post-Olympics At the 1924 Summer Olympics, Kovacs, a Hungarian judge, made a controversial call in a fencing match, siding with France over Italy. An Italian fencer, Aldo Boni, verbally attacked the judge for the ruling and refused to apologize when asked. Santelli was called in as a witness to Boni's outbreak, and the Italian team was forced to resign from the competition. Once in Italy, the Italian team's captain, Adolfo Cotronei, accused Santelli of speaking out against Boni to remove them from the competition, supposedly fearing they would eliminate his adopted nation of Hungary, who would go on to take the bronze at the 1924 Games. Cotronei challenged Santelli, already past 60 years of age, to a duel. Giorgio Santelli, under the rules of the \\"code duello\\", took his father's place in the fight, and won the duel with a riposte to Cotronei's face. Santelli went on to coach numerous notable fencing students over the course of his career. Santelli died on February 8, 1945, at the age of 78, in Livorno, Italy.

His original personal name was Zhao Zongshi but it was changed to \\"Zhao Shu\\" in 1062 by imperial decree. He reigned from 1063 to his death in 1067. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Emperor Shenzong. Family Background Emperor Yingzong was the 13th son of Zhao Yunrang (趙允讓; 969–1059), who was a first cousin of Emperor Renzong and was posthumously known as \\"Prince Anyi of Pu\\" (). Emperor Yingzong's grandfather, Zhao Yuanfen (趙元份; 966–1005), was a younger brother of Emperor Renzong's father, Emperor Zhenzong, and was posthumously known as \\"Prince Gongjing of Shang\\" (). Emperor Yingzong's mother, whose maiden family name was Ren (), was the concubine of Zhao Yunrang. She held the title \\"Xianjun of Xianyou\\" ().  Early life  In 1055, Emperor Yingzong's predecessor, Emperor Renzong, became critically ill and started to worry about having no successor because his sons all died prematurely. Acting on the advice of his ministers, Emperor Renzong agreed to bring two of his younger male relatives into his palace. One of them was the future Emperor Yingzong, who was eventually chosen and designated as the Crown Prince. Yingzong had his name changed to \\"Zhao Shu\\" in 1062 when he was officially designated as the Crown Prince. This name became his official name when he ascended the throne in the following year after his adoptive father Emperor Renzong died in 1063. Reign Emperor Yingzong's empress consort was Empress Gao, a niece of Empress Dowager Cao who was the widow of Emperor Renzong. As Emperor Yingzong was severely sickly shortly after his coronation, Empress Dowager Cao served as his regent. However, Empress Dowager Cao held onto power even when Yingzong recovered until the Prime Minister Han Qi removed the screen from the audience hall making it impossible for Empress Dowager Cao to attend. She was forced to give power back to Yingzong. Emperor Yingzong's reign is known for controversy over the correct rituals to be performed by the emperor for his father. Emperor Yingzong had been adopted by Emperor Renzong, so Emperor Renzong was nominally Emperor Yingzong's father. However, biologically, Zhao Yunrang was Emperor Yingzong's father. Some officials suggested that Emperor Yingzong honour his biological father with the title \\"Imperial Uncle\\", but the emperor agreed with Ouyang Xiu and others and decided to honour his biological father as his parent. This was not only an early sign of more conflict during Emperor Xiaozong's reign but also the Great Rites Controversy of the Ming dynasty. On April 7, 1063, Yingzong sent gifts including calligraphy made by Emperor Renzong to the Vietnamese King Ly Thanh Tong.Anderson (2008), 200. Later, Than Thieu Thai raided Guangnan West Circuit prompting local officials to seek help from Yingzong but he ignored them leaving defences up to them although he branded Than Thieu Thai as \\"reckless and mad.”Anderson (2008), 201. In 1065 AD, Emperor Yingzong ordered the great historian Sima Guang (1019–1086 AD) to lead with other scholars such as his chief assistants Liu Shu, Liu Ban and Fan Zuyu,Xu Elina-Qian, p.20 the compilation of a universal history of China. He died in 1067, caused by an illness that Yingzong contracted in 1066.Other sources say he collapsed. He was succeeded by his son Zhao Xu who took the throne name Emperor Shenzong. Emperor Yingzong had always been mentally ill, often distracted, physically weak, and depressed causing him to have health problems which contributed to his death at a young age.

The company grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s, implementing key systems such as the accounting system for New York City and The Standard Procurement System for the United States Department of Defense. The company was acquired by CGI Group in 2004, with AMS's federal defense business being acquired by CACI. History AMS was founded in 1970 by five former Defense Department \\"Whiz Kids\\": Charles Rossotti, Ivan Selin, Frank Nicolai, Patrick W. Gross, and Jan Lodal. The company's initial headquarters were in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Arlington, Virginia. From its inception, much of AMS's revenue was derived from contracts with federal agencies. The company grew quickly during the 1970s. During its first decade of operation, AMS focused its business on consulting and selling customized software to large government and corporate organizations. The company grew to over nine thousand employees, with many offices in both the United States and other countries. At one point in the 1990s, one quarter of the company's revenue, albeit none of the profit, came from Europe. Much of its business centered on creating large computer systems for various government entities. It created a large accounting system for New York City during the city's recovery from its fiscal crisis in the late 1970s, and won an award for the Defense Department's Standard Procurement System in 1997. = Telecom Practice = In the late 1990s and early 2000s, American Management Systems was among the main telecom consulting companies in the United States. The company grew aggressively because of professional talent in the emerging Competitive Local Exchange Companies. As a result, AMS was a market leader to offer its telecom client Kenan's Arbor-B/P, the award-winning convergence Billing Solution. = AMS in Europe = At the beginning of the 1990s, AMS provided the PRISM billing solution for the American cellular network operator PacTel Cellular, who later became AirTouch. Following the expansion of the GSM standard in Europe, AirTouch International invested in a number of foreign GSM providers. This led to the expansion of the AMS billing solution, re-branded as Spectrum 2000, into Europe. In 1992 AMS was in a unique position as provider of the billing system to the emerging mobile telco market in Europe, making AMS a major player in the European Market. AMS expanded into Portugal, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, and Poland. Despite this success, the company did not develop sufficient service delivery and business development units. Instead, it decided to commit to a huge (over 100M$) investment in the development of the sophisticated Customer Care and Billing System Tapestry for German fixed-wire telecom Arcor. Lack of commitment to marketing of this system contributed to the problems that led to significant layoffs in Europe in 2002. Furthermore AMS lost prestige when D2 chose Amdocs for its billing solution. By 2002, AMS had approximately 6300 employees, 986 million in revenue and 21 million in income and 51 offices worldwide. = Lawsuits, divestiture, and sale = In 1999, the state government of Mississippi terminated an $11.2 million contract with AMS to modernize the state's tax system and sued the company for $985 million in damages. A jury awarded the state $474.5 million in actual and punitive damages in August 2000, causing a drop in stock price from 44 3/8 to 14. The company subsequently settled the suit for $185 million. Another customer, the Federal Thrift Investment Board, cancelled a contract in 2000 for a system to make Thrift Savings Plan data available online. The subsequent lawsuit was settled for $5 million in June 2003. A subsequent United States Senate investigation authored by senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman identified various reasons for four years of delays and cost overruns, including lack of formal agreement on a detailed design and problems with the structure of the contract. In December 2002, AMS sold its Global Energy Group to Bangalore, India-based Wipro Technologies. New CEO Alfred T. Mockett was hired by AMS in 2001 to grow the company's sales from $1.1 billion to $3 billion a year, with a goal of becoming a top tier system integrator through growth and acquisitions, with an eventual goal of a \\"big bang merger of equals.\\" When this strategy proved unsuccessful, Mockett negotiated a sale of the firm. CGI, a Canadian company, was the primary purchaser, paying $858 million for the commercial business and all government business not related to national defense. The defense portion of AMS could not be sold to a foreign-based company so CACI purchased the defense and intelligence practice for $415 million. The sale to CGI and CACI was announced in March 2004. The AMS brand was retained by CGI for a time and the AMS website directed users to the CGI site. CGI's United States headquarters are in Fairfax, Virginia. Location For the first 20 or more years of its existence, the company was based in Arlington, Virginia on the banks of the Potomac River with a commanding view of Washington DC. In the early 1990s, AMS moved its corporate headquarters to Fairfax, Virginia. List of chief executive officers of AMS * Ivan Selin - 1970 to late 1980s * Charles O.

Although its autofocus mechanism is slow in comparison to modern standards, it was an improvement on Nikon's first attempt at an autofocus SLR - the F-501 (N2020 in North America), and proved to be reliable and durable, typical of Nikon's cameras. Features Despite being designated in the number range usually reserved for amateur cameras (indicated by the non-single digit after the F, eg. not F3), the F-801 was built to a high standard and incorporated a number of professional features: * A Depth of Field preview button allows temporary stopping down to the shooting aperture to check DOF. * A Multiple Exposure facility allows up to nine shots within one frame. * A unique 'two shot' self-timer. This allowed a second shot to be taken by the self-timer a couple of seconds after the first, giving a more 'relaxed' and unposed picture. * Fully programmed automatic exposure, Aperture priority, Shutter priority and fully manual exposure control. * 30-second to 1/8000-second shutter speed range with bulb mode. * Film-speed setting from DX code or by manual override (ISO 6 to 6400). * 1/250-sec. flash synchronisation. * Evaluative 2D Matrix and 75% Centre-Weighted Average metering modes. * Compatibility with the Nikon Multi-Control Back MF-21, allowing freeze-focus, data imprinting, and automatic exposure bracketing. Compatibility Nikon N8008 top panel View Like the Nikon F4, the F-801 is broadly compatible with most Nikon AI and AF F-mount lenses, though some features are unavailable depending on the lens type. All features are available when used with AF-type lenses. Non-CPU (AI and AI-S) lenses are supported, but only Manual and Aperture-Priority exposure programs are available, using centre-weighted metering. Autofocus is not supported with AF-I and AF-S lenses, and Vibration Reduction (VR) is not available regardless of the lens. Newer G-type lenses are usable with the Program and Shutter- Priority exposure programs (though it is possible to use them in Manual or Aperture-Priority programs, but only at minimum aperture). The F-801 continued the trend established by earlier Nikon cameras such as the F-301/N2000 and F-501/N2020 in not being provided with an ISO-standard cable release socket. Instead, all remote interaction with the camera is carried out via the two-pin remote terminal on the front of the body. One can use an ISO cable release with the body by purchasing a Terminal Release MR-3 and fitting it to the remote terminal. Despite the camera's complexity (900 parts, two microcomputers, and eight ICs), both the F-801 (N8008) and its successor the F-801s (N8008s) enjoy an enviable reputation for extremely reliable performance and durability, a weak point of many mid-level AF SLR cameras. Related models The F-801 provided a semi-professional autofocus successor to the manual-focus Nikon FE2 SLR, which had been manufactured until 1987. The success of the F-801 led to an updated version of this camera in 1991, which was designated the F-801S/N8008S. It had improved autofocus performance and incorporated spot metering, but retained the original model's reputation for reliability.

His recent publications, in the field of epistemology, have defended a version of rationalism.  Biography  Son of the British theologian and biochemist Arthur Peacocke, he was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics as an undergraduate, winning both the Webb Medley Prize in Economics and the Henry Wilde Prize in Philosophy in 1971, and graduated with a first class degree. Later that year he was awarded a Kennedy Memorial Trust scholarship to study at Harvard University. He then continued at Oxford gaining a BPhil (1974) and DPhil (1979) in Philosophy, the latter under the supervision of Michael Dummett. He was Visiting Lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, 1975-6, and in 1975 elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He was the Susan Stebbing Professor of Philosophy at King's College London from 1985 to 1989 and Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Oxford University from 1989 to 2000, at which time he moved to New York University (NYU). He joined the Philosophy Department at Columbia University in 2004, where he is now Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy. In 2007 he was named to the Richard Wollheim chair in philosophy at University College, London, where he taught in the third (summer) term each year until 2015. He lives with his wife and he has two adult children. He is also Visiting Professor of Philosophy at New College of the Humanities.  Philosophical work  Of his earlier work, he is perhaps best known for the first chapter of his 1983 book, Sense and Content, entitled \\"Sensation and the Content of Experience.\\" In this chapter, Peacocke defends the claim that perceptual experience, over and above its intentional content, has certain \\"sensational properties\\". He gives three different examples of visual scenarios where intentional content alone cannot capture every aspect of the experience. Those aspects which elude intentional content are thought to be the sensational properties of the experience. Some of those who defend qualia have used these examples as evidence of their existence. Several philosophers have criticized these examples (Michael Tye, Fred Dretske), claiming that the supposed extra quality can indeed be captured in terms of intentional content. In Sense and Content, Peacocke assumed that the intentional content of mental states is exclusively conceptual content, i.e. the content is such that the subject of the state needs to possess all the concepts that specify the intentional content in question. From about 1986 and onwards, Peacocke abandoned this assumption, arguing that some mental states, in particular perceptual experiences and representational states implicated in subpersonal information processing (for example, in the subconscious parsing of heard speech), have non-conceptual intentional content. Peacocke is now often seen as a leading proponent of this notion of non-conceptual intentional content. In his 1992 book A Study of Concepts, Peacocke gives a detailed exposition of a philosophical theory of concept possession, according to which the nature and identity conditions for concepts may be given, in a non-circular way, by the conditions a thinker has to satisfy in order to possess the relevant concepts. The theory is a version of a so-called \\"conceptual\\" or \\"inferential role\\" theory of concepts.

He served in the Florida Territorial Legislature and the Florida State House of Representatives. He served as the sixth Governor of Florida, at the end of the American Civil War.  Early life  Allison was born in Jones County, Georgia, on December 10, 1814,verified by census records of 1850, 1870, 1880 and 1885 to Captain James and Sarah Fannin Allison. After he graduated from school, he worked as a merchant in Columbus, Georgia, and in Henry County, Alabama.Morris pg. 299 He then moved to Apalachicola, Florida, where he served as the city's first mayor. He also served as the first county judge of Franklin County and as Clerk of the United States Court. He was a member of the Territorial Legislature. In the Seminole War, he was captain of the Franklin Rifles. He moved to Quincy, Gadsden County in 1839 and there commenced the practice of law. In 1843, he built a Georgian colonial home in Quincy. In 1989 it became the Allison House Inn, a bed and breakfast.  Early political career  He was again elected to the Territorial Legislature, and represented Gadsden County in the State Legislature in 1845, 1847 and 1852. As Speaker of the House, he assumed the duties of acting Governor on September 16, 1853, because both Governor Thomas Brown and Senate President R. J. Floyd were out of the state. He gave up the office on the inauguration of James E. Broome on October 3. Allison did not exercise executive powers and merely held himself in readiness should a need arise. He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1861. He served during the Confederacy in the Florida State Senate from 1862 through 1864.  Governorship and later life  After Governor John Milton died on April 1, 1865 either from an accident or suicide, Allison, as the state senate president, assumed the office of Governor. He resigned his office on May 19, 1865, and went into hiding the day before Federal troops formally occupied Tallahassee. He was captured by Union forces on June 19, 1865, and held for several months at Fort Pulaski. After his release, he returned to Quincy to practice law. During the election of 1870, Allison led a band of armed men to block black voters from the polls until they closed. This nearly eliminated the Republican majority in Gadsden County. In 1872, he was convicted of \\"intimidating Negroes\\" for this incident and jailed for six months and fined. He died in Quincy, Florida, on July 8, 1893.

Prior to 1937, Regency Acts were passed only when necessary to deal with a specific situation. In 1937, the Regency Act 1937 made general provision for a regent, and established the office of Counsellor of State, several of whom would act on the monarch's behalf when the monarch was temporarily absent from the realm. This Act forms the main law relating to regency in the United Kingdom today. An example of a pre-1937 Regency Act was the Act of 1811 which allowed George, Prince of Wales to act as regent while his father, King George III, was incapacitated. George ruled as the Prince Regent until his father's death, when he ascended the throne as King George IV. History Prior to 1937, there was no permanent, general provision in British law for a regent to be appointed if the British monarch were incapacitated or absent from the country. Nor was there a general provision for a regent to rule on behalf of an heir apparent or heir presumptive who succeeded to the throne as a minor. Before the Glorious Revolution, it was up to the sovereign to decide who would be regent in any event, although this decision was often implemented by legislation. For example, section XI of the Treason Act 1554 made King Philip, husband and co- ruler of Queen Mary I, regent in the event that Mary died and her heir was male and under 18, or an unmarried female under 15. By the Act of Settlement 1701, Parliament passed the line of succession to Electress Sophia of Hanover; this decision was confirmed and extended to all of Great Britain by the Acts of Union 1707. With the doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy firmly established in British law, it became possible for Parliament to pass legislation to determine who would act as regent during the absence, incapacity or minority of the ruling monarch. Since then several Regency Acts have been passed. File:The Rt. Honble. Thomas Ld. Parker Barn. of Macclesfield and Ld.

The Regency Act 1705 was passed \\"to put it [the succession] in such a method as was not to be resisted but by open force of arms and a public declaration for the Pretender\\".Geoffrey Holmes, British Politics in the Age of Anne. Revised Edition (London: The Hambledon Press, 1987), p. 84. The Act required privy counsellors and other officers, in the event of Anne's death, to proclaim as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and made it high treason to fail to do so. If the next Protestant successor was abroad at the death of Anne, seven great Officers of State named in the Act (and others whom the heir-apparent thought fit to appoint), called \\"Lords Justices\\", would form a regency. The heir-apparent would name these others through a secret instrument which would be sent to England in three copies and delivered to the Hanoverian Resident, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chancellor.Wolfgang Michael, England Under George I. The Beginnings of the Hanoverian Dynasty (London: Macmillan, 1936), pp. 4–5. The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662. Two years later, after the union of Scotland and England, the new Parliament of Great Britain passed the Succession to the Crown Act 1707, reaffirming the above procedure and modifying it slightly. Under the act, if the monarch died while the heir to the throne was overseas, the government would be run until the new monarch returned by between seven and fourteen \\"Lords Justices\\". Seven of the Lords Justices were named in the Act, and the next monarch could appoint seven more, who would be named in writing, three copies of which were to be sent to the Privy Council in England.Sections 12 and 13 of the Act The Act made it treason for any unauthorized person to open these, or to neglect to deliver them to the Privy Council.Section 14 The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.Section 17 Upon Queen Anne's death in 1714, George I, the new king, was in his home realm of Hanover. In accordance with the Succession to the Crown Act, Thomas Parker, Lord Chief Justice, became head of the regency. He served for a little over a month. =Regency Act 1728= The second Act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to deal exclusively with a regency was in 1728, the Regency During the King's Absence Act 1728 (2 Geo. 2 c. 27). The Act specified that Queen Caroline would act as regent in the absence of her husband King George II rather than the Prince of Wales, whom he despised. The Act was necessary because George II was also Elector of Hanover and was returning to his homeland for a visit. =Minority of Successor to Crown Act 1751= In 1751, Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son and heir apparent of King George II, died. This left Frederick's eldest son, Prince George, as the new heir apparent. But George was only 12 at the time of his father's death. If the King were to die before Prince George turned 18, the throne would pass to a minor. Consequently, Parliament made a provision for a regent by passing the Minority of Successor to Crown Act 1751 (24 Geo. 2 c. 24).Text of Minority of Successor to the Crown Act 1751 This Act provided that George's mother, Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, would act as regent. The Act also specified that a Council of Regency be put in place to rule alongside Princess Augusta. The Council of Regency was to act as a brake on the regent's power; some acts of the royal prerogative, such as declarations of war or the signing of peace treaties, would require a majority vote of the council. The provisions of this act actually never came into force, since Prince George had already come of age at the time of the death of his grandfather. =Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765= In 1760, King George III ascended the throne, with his brother Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, as heir presumptive. However, the new King soon married and had several children. By 1765, the King had three infant children in the order of succession. Parliament again passed a Regency Act to provide for a regent in the event of the King's death. The Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3 c. 27)Text of Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765 provided that either the King's wife, Queen Charlotte, or his mother, Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, would act as regent. This Act also required the formation of a Council of Regency. As with the previous act, the provision of this act actually never came into force, since the eldest son of George III was already 57 when his father died. =Regency Bill 1789= The Regency Bill of 1789 was a proposed Act of Parliament to provide that King George III's eldest son George, Prince of Wales, would act as regent due to the King's incapacity through mental illness. With no legislation already in place, there was no legal basis for providing a regent, and the King was in no fit state to give Royal Assent to the Act. Parliament decided to have the Lord Chancellor (Lord Thurlow) approve the bill by fixing the Great Seal of the Realm to give Royal Assent. However, the King recovered in time before the bill could be passed. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, and others thought the Act illegal; but following his recovery, the King declared that the government had acted correctly. The King's continuing mental problems throughout the rest of his life confirmed the need for a suitable Regency Act to be in place. However, the King was hostile to the passing of such an Act while he was of sound mind. =Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811= In late 1810, King George III was once again overcome by mental illness, following the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1789: without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners. Such letters patent were irregular, because they did not bear the Royal Sign Manual, and only Letters Patent signed by the Sovereign himself can provide for the appointment of Lords Commissioners or for the granting of Royal Assent. However, because the King was already incapacitated de facto, resolutions by both Houses of Parliament approved the action, directing the Lord Chancellor to prepare the Letters Patent and to affix the Great Seal to them even without the signature of the monarch. The Lords Commissioners thus appointed, in the name of the King, signified the granting of the Royal Assent to a bill which became the Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811 (51 Geo. 3 c. 1). Under this Act, the King was suspended from the personal discharge of the royal functions, and George, Prince of Wales discharged those functions in the name and on behalf of the King from 1811 until 1820, when the King died and the Prince of Wales succeeded to the throne. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act. The 1811–1820 period is known as the Regency era. The importance of this Regency Act was that it did not require a Council of Regency, as required by previous legislation. One reason for this was that the Prince Regent was heir apparent to the throne in any case, and would assume full powers upon his father's death. =Regency Act 1830= In 1830 the throne passed to George IV's younger brother (George III's third-eldest son), King William IV. But William IV had no legitimate children, and given the age of his wife, Queen Adelaide, he was unlikely to have any in the future. The heir presumptive to the throne was his niece, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria) who was only eleven. As Victoria's father was dead, and Parliament mistrusted the younger sons of George III, the Act (1 Will. 4 c. 2) placed any potential regency caused by the King's death before Victoria had reached 18, in her mother, the Duchess of Kent. However, if Queen Adelaide gave birth to a child, that child was to become king or queen instead of Victoria, and Adelaide would become regent. If such a birth occurred after the King's death, his child was to immediately succeed Victoria, in Victoria's lifetime, as king or queen. The Act prohibited either monarch from marrying during the regency without the Regent's consent, and made it high treason to marry the monarch without such consent, or to assist in or be concerned in the marriage. The Act also prohibited the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne, or to repeal or alter the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.\\"A Collection of the Public General Statutes Passed in the First and Second Years of the Reign of His Majesty King William the Fourth, 1830, 1831.\\" London: J. Richards, 1834. However, since Victoria became queen aged 18, and Queen Adelaide had no more children, a regency was unnecessary and the Act never came into force. =Lords Justices Act 1837= In 1837 Princess Victoria of Kent succeeded her uncle to become Queen Victoria. She became monarch aged 18, while she was still unmarried and without children. The next in the line of succession was her uncle, the 66-year-old Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who succeeded King William IV in the Kingdom of Hanover as Salic Law prevented Victoria becoming Queen of Hanover. Thus Ernest August departed the United Kingdom to take up his role in Hanover. This meant that until the Queen married and had legitimate children, the heir presumptive to the throne and his children would reside abroad. Although they would almost certainly return to the United Kingdom in the event of Victoria dying without an heir, it would take some weeks for this to happen using nineteenth century transport. To provide for the continuation of government in such an instance, Parliament passed the Lords Justices Act 1837 (7 Will. 4. & 1 Vict. c. 72, long title: An Act to provide for the Appointment of Lords Justices in the Case of the next Successor to the Crown being out of the Realm at the Time of the Demise of Her Majesty). This Act did not provide for a specific regent to be appointed, as it was expected that the new monarch would arrive in the country within a reasonable time. Thus the Act provided only for Lords Justices, including such people as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, to take up some of the monarch's duties. Unlike the powers granted to prospective regents in previous legislation, the powers of the Lords Justice were more limited; for example, they could not dissolve Parliament or create peerages. =Regency Act 1840= By 1840, Queen Victoria had married her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and soon gave birth to The Princess Victoria. It was expected that the Queen would have many other children; however, they would be in minority for at least the next 18 years, and Parliament again would have to provide for a regent in the event of Victoria's death. The previous Lords Justices Act 1837 would not apply to the Queen's children, as they resided in the UK. Parliament therefore passed the Regency Act 1840 (3 & 4 Vict. c. 52) which provided for Prince Albert to rule as regent until the eldest child reached the age of 18. The Act did not require a Regency Council to operate alongside Prince Albert, potentially giving him more power than earlier proposed regents. The Act was fairly controversial at the time, as the British people were suspicious of Prince Albert and he was generally unpopular in Parliament. However Victoria lived until 1901 and, in any case, Albert predeceased her, so he did not become regent. The Act would have prohibited the monarch from marrying during the regency without written consent from the Regent and both houses of Parliament, and made it high treason to marry the monarch without such consent, or to assist in or be concerned in the marriage. The Act also prohibited the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne, or a bill to repeal or alter the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.\\"A Collection of the Public General Statutes Passed in the Third and Fourth Year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, 1840.\\" London: Eyre & Spottiswoode (1840), pp. 301–304. =Regency Act 1910= In 1910 Queen Victoria's grandson, King George V, succeeded to the throne. However, his children were all under the age of 18. Therefore, Parliament passed a new Regency Act (10 Edw. 7 & 1 Geo. 5 c. 26) in 1910, that named the King's consort, Queen Mary, as regent. No regency council was provided for, following the Regency Act 1840. Once again, the provisions of this Act never came into operation, as the Prince of Wales was well over 18 by the time George V died. Acts currently in force governing the establishment of a Regency The Acts currently in force governing the cases in which a Regency shall come into existence and when a Regency shall cease, the determination of who shall be Regent and the powers of such Regent are the Regency Act 1937, the Regency Act 1943, and the Regency Act 1953, jointly referred to as the \\"Regency Acts 1937 to 1953\\". =Regency Act 1937= In 1936, George VI (George V's second son) had become King, with his elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, as heir presumptive. However, Elizabeth was under the age of 18, leading to the need for a new Regency Act. Rather than pass a specific Regency Act relating to the death or incapacity of George VI only, Parliament passed the Regency Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6 c. 16), which provided for the incapacity or minority of all future monarchs. It also repealed the Lords Justices Act 1837, and established in statute the office of Counsellor of State, to be appointed during the monarch's absence abroad, or temporary illness not amounting to complete incapacity. The Act required that the regent should be the next person in the line of succession who was: * over the age of 21, * a British subject domiciled in the United Kingdom, and * capable of succeeding to the Crown under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701. The Counsellors of State were to consist of: * the consort of the monarch and * the next four people in the line of succession over the age of 21, excluding any person who is disqualified from being Regent. Thus, at the time of the passing of the Act, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester would have become Regent in the event that King George VI died while The Princess Elizabeth was still a minor. The current prospective regent under the Act, who would assume the functions of Regent should Queen Elizabeth II become incapacitated, would be her eldest son Charles, Prince of Wales. Section 4 of the Act prohibits the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the British throne or to repeal or alter the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707. =Regency Act 1943= This Act (6 & 7 Geo. 6 c. 42) modified the Regency Act 1937 so that counsellors of state who were absent during the Sovereign's absence would not be listed among the appointments. It also declared that the heir-apparent or presumptive to the throne (first in the line of succession) only had to be 18 to be a counsellor. =Regency Act 1953= In 1952 King George VI died and was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. With her eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Charles, under the age of 21, the Regency Act 1937 would provide for the next person over the age of 21 in the line of succession, the Queen's sister Princess Margaret, to act as regent. However, although a regency was already provided for, Parliament made a new law creating a provision specific to the scenario of the succession to the throne of a son or daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, while still under the age of 18 years. That provision, which ceased to have any relevance in law once all children of Elizabeth and Philip reached adulthood, was to the effect that Prince Philip, if living, would act as regent in case of an underage succession to the Crown by one of the children born of his marriage to Queen Elizabeth II. Furthermore, if a regency was necessary during Elizabeth II's reign, the Duke of Edinburgh would act as regent if the Queen had no eligible children or grandchildren. At the bill's second reading, David Maxwell-Fyfe, the Home Secretary, explained: The Act also allowed the Queen's mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, to become a Counsellor of State again, a position she had lost on the death of her husband King George VI. Most of the provisions of the Regency Act 1953 (2 & 3 Eliz. 2 c. 1) ceased to be applicable as the Queen's children came of age. The sole provision of the 1953 Act that is still relevant is section 2, which reduced to 18 the age at which the heir to the throne could become Regent. This was done to remove the perceived anomaly that a person aged 18 could become a counsellor of state and could, upon accession to the throne, personally discharge the royal functions, but could not act as a regent until 21. In fact, this had been intended in 1937. In 1937, when the bill was still in committee, the attorney-general had said: > There might well arise a case where the heir to the Throne was under 18 > years of age and where it would be necessary to have a Regent, but that such > Regent would only be a few months older. It would then be rather absurd to > appoint as Regent someone only six months older than the King. Consequently > ... there should be a minimum difference of three years.Hansard, 4 February > 1937, column 1829. Situations in which the royal functions are transferred to a Regent According to the Regency Acts 1937 to 1953, presently in force, there is provision for the establishment of a regency either on account of the minority of the monarch or of the absolute incapacity of the monarch to discharge the Royal Functions. =Regency in the case of the minority of the Sovereign= According to the Regency Acts in force, if the monarch is under the age of 18 years when he or she succeeds to the Throne, a regency is automatically established, and, until the monarch attains the age of 18 years, the royal functions are discharged by the regent in the name and on behalf of the monarch. In that case, any oaths or declarations required by statute to be taken by the Sovereign on or after succeeding to the Crown are postponed until the sovereign's personal assumption of the royal functions, and for the purpose of all such enactments regarding oaths and declarations that the new monarch must make upon accession \\"the date on which the Sovereign attains the age of eighteen years shall be deemed to be the date of His Accession\\". =Regency in the case of infirmity of mind or body or of unavailability for a definite cause= Unlike any of the preceding Regency Acts, the Regency Act 1937 (which is still in force) established in law a procedure for determining the incapacity of the Sovereign due to infirmity of mind or body or due to the monarch's unavailability for another definite cause. When a declaration of incapacity is made in accordance with the procedure set out in the Regency Act 1937 a Regency is established and the royal functions are transferred from the Sovereign to a Regent, who discharges them in the name and on behalf of the monarch until a declaration is made in accordance with the said Act to the effect that the monarch's incapacity has ceased. Declarations of incapacity and capacity According to section 2 of the Regency Act 1937, the people who can make a declaration of incapacity (or a declaration that the incapacity has ended) are the consort of the Sovereign, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chief Justice of England, and the Master of the Rolls. these positions were held by, respectively, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Robert Buckland; Sir Lindsay Hoyle; Lord Burnett of Maldon; and Sir Terence Etherton. Any declaration of incapacity or of cessation of incapacity needs to be signed by three or more of them. Declarations based on the monarch's unavailability for a definite cause need to be supported by evidence, and declarations attesting the Sovereign's incapacity by reason of infirmity of mind or body need to be supported by evidence including evidence provided by physicians. A declaration of incapacity or of cessation of incapacity needs to be made to the Privy Council and communicated to the governments of the Dominions. Incapacity of the Regent Under the Regency Act 1937, a declaration of incapacity can also be made with respect to the regent. Thus, if the person serving as regent becomes incapable of discharging the royal functions, either on account of an infirmity of mind or body, or because the regent has become, for a definite cause, unavailable to perform the said functions, the same group of people who can make a declaration of incapacity regarding the sovereign (the wife or husband of the monarch, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chief Justice of England and the Master of the Rolls) are empowered to make a declaration of incapacity regarding the regent. The requirements for that declaration of incapacity are the same ones that are valid with regard to a declaration affecting the sovereign: the incapacity of the regent must be attested by evidence; in the case of infirmity that evidence shall include evidence provided by physicians; the declaration needs to be signed by at least three of the people empowered by law; and it needs to be lodged with the Privy Council. Under section 3, subsection 5, of the Regency Act 1937, when the regent is the object of a declaration of incapacity, he or she ceases to be the regent, as if he or she were dead, and the person next in line capable of discharging the regency becomes regent in his or her place. When a regent is removed from office by a declaration of incapacity and subsequently the incapacity ceases to exist, the regent can be restored to office by means of a declaration of cessation of incapacity. In that case upon the declaration of cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with the person who has a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the declaration of incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for declaration of cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a declaration of cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign. Assumption of office by the Regent: oaths to be taken before the Privy Council Whenever a regency is established, either on account of incapacity of the sovereign (duly declared in accordance with the procedure prescribed in statute), or on account of the minority of the Sovereign, and also when there is a change of regent, the new \\"Regent shall, before he acts in or enters upon his office,\\" take the oaths required by the Regency Act 1937; accordingly, a new regent only enters into the execution of his office by taking the oaths, and therefore cannot discharge any of the royal functions before taking them. The oaths required to be taken by a new Regent upon his assumption of office are as follows: The said oaths need to be taken and subscribed by the new Regent before the Privy Council, and the Regency Act, 1937 specifies that \\"the Privy Council are empowered and required to administer those oaths and to enter them in the Council Books\\". Guardianship of the Sovereign during a Regency Unlike the situations of minor infirmity or of travel abroad that allow for the possible delegation of the royal functions by the monarch to counsellors of state (as authorised by section 6 of the Regency Act 1937), the establishment of a regency carries with it the notion that the sovereign is not fit and able to administer the affairs of his own person, so that he needs a legal guardian. The guardianship of the monarch, however, is not governed by the same ordinary body of laws that regulate the appointment of legal guardians to people in general. Instead of the legal guardian of the Sovereign being appointed by a court based on the recommendations of the social services, the guardianship of the monarch is provided for directly by Regency Act 1937, presently in force. Because the sovereign in his or her private capacity is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, the institution of a regency remains the sole method of placing the person of the sovereign under legal guardianship. And, according to the provisions of the Regency Acts in force, the creation of a regency to discharge the royal functions and the legal guardianship of the monarch go hand in hand: the monarch is only subject to legal guardianship when there is a regency, and always when there is a regency the monarch is placed under legal guardianship. The legal guardianship of the person of the monarch (with the corresponding power to administer the private property of the sovereign) does not necessarily rest with the regent. However, if the none of the prospective guardians provided for in the statute exist, then, also according to the statute, the regent becomes the guardian of the sovereign. Accordingly, during a regency, the regent is the person invested with the royal authority, that discharges the royal functions on behalf of the monarch. The guardian, on the other hand, has the legal custody of the sovereign (who is either a minor or an incapacitated person) and the duty to care for the monarch's personal well being. The two roles may or may not be combined. According to section 5 of the Regency Act 1937,http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Edw8and1Geo6/1/16/section/5 if the monarch is under the age of eighteen years and unmarried, then his or her mother, if living, shall have the guardianship of the monarch's person. On the other hand, if the sovereign is married, but is still under the age of eighteen years, or if the sovereign is a married adult, but has been declared incapable for the time being of performing the royal functions, then the wife or husband of the sovereign, if of full age, shall have the guardianship of the person of the monarch. In all other cases except the two situations described above (that is, if the sovereign is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, but his mother is no longer living; or if the sovereign is married, but the wife or husband is not of full age; or if the sovereign has been declared incapable of performing the royal functions, but does not have a wife or husband), then the regent shall be the legal guardian of the monarch and shall have custody of his or her person, and the property of the sovereign, except any private property which in accordance with the terms of any trust affecting it is to be administered by some other person, shall be administered by the regent. Current position =Regency= , under the provisions of the Regency Acts in force, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, would act as regent in the event of the incapacity of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The next person in the line of succession, the Prince of Wales' elder son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, would also be able to succeed without necessitating a regency and would be eligible to be regent for his grandmother or his father. , the first person under the age of 18 in the line of succession to the throne is William's son Prince George of Cambridge, who is third in line to the throne after his grandfather and father. If the prince were to succeed to the throne before his 18th birthday on 22 July 2031, his uncle, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (the Prince of Wales' younger son), would serve as regent (if domiciled in the United Kingdom, as required by the 1937 Act), as George's younger siblings Charlotte and Louis (currently fourth and fifth in line, respectively) would also be minors. In the event that Prince Harry would be unable to serve as regent, the next in line would be his uncle (Prince George's grand-uncle) Prince Andrew, Duke of York, followed by the Duke of York's elder daughter Princess Beatrice. =Legal guardianship= Currently, if Elizabeth II were to be declared incapable of discharging the royal functions, the legal guardianship of the incapacitated monarch would be vested in her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. If, however, the Duke of Edinburgh were to predecease his wife or be otherwise unable to carry out the duties of legal guardian, the guardianship of the Sovereign would then be vested in the sitting Regent. Prince George of Cambridge, should he ascend to the throne prior to his 18th birthday, is the first person in the present line of succession who would require Regency and Legal Guardianship, until he was 18. According to the Regency Acts as currently in force, should this occur, his legal guardianship would be vested in his mother, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. If she were to be unable to carry out the duties of legal guardian, they would then revert to the sitting Regent.

She was known as \\"Canada's Conscience\\". Callwood achieved acclaim and a loyal following for her articles and columns written for national newspapers and magazines, including Maclean's and Chatelaine. She solidified her name by founding charities focused on certain communities in Canada, including Nellie’s, one of Canada’s first shelters for women in crisis, Jessie’s Centre for Teenagers, now the June Callwood Centre for Women and Families, and Casey House, Canada’s first HIV/AIDS hospice.  Childhood  Callwood was born in Chatham, Ontario and grew up in nearby Belle River, with her younger sister Jane. Her mother was the daughter of a Métis bootlegger and her father was the son of a magistrate. Her parents' marriage was deeply troubled, and despite the affection shown to her by her grandparents, Callwood's childhood was marked by adversity. They were desperately poor, moving at night from one house to another. Finally her childhood came to an abrupt end when her father left the family and she was forced to drop out of high school to earn an income. Career Callwood began her journalism career at her high school, Brantford Collegiate Institute, where she was editor of the school paper. She later worked for the Brantford Expositor, as a cub reporter. During this time, in the midst of World War II, June was earning $7.50 a week, half of which she gave to her mother for rent. In 1942, she was offered a job with The Globe and Mail and moved to Toronto. She married journalist Trent Frayne two years later, but continued to use her own surname because The Globe and Mail at that time did not employ married women. Callwood left The Globe and Mail to raise a family but later resumed her career by becoming a freelance journalist, writing books and magazine pieces, many for Maclean's. In the spring of 1957, she interviewed Elvis Presley in Toronto, during the singer's first tour of Canada. Soon after, she ghost-wrote autobiographies for such prominent Americans as broadcaster Barbara Walters, film director Otto Preminger and Dr. Charles William Mayo. Frayne and Callwood also hosted the CBC Television talk show The Fraynes in the 1954-55 television season. Callwood later entered television journalism, hosting the series In Touch on CBC Television from 1975 to 1978. She also hosted two series, National Treasure and Caregiving with June Callwood, for Vision TV. Callwood's career was marked by a strong concern for social justice, especially on issues affecting children and women. She became one of Canada's most famous social justice activists, founding or co-founding over 50 Canadian social action organizations including youth and women's hostels. She founded Casey House (a Toronto hospice for people with AIDS), Jessie's (now called Jessie's: The June Callwood Centre for Young Women), PEN Canada, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and Feminists Against Censorship. In 2004, Callwood went public about her battle with cancer. She refused treatment and continued to be active until she succumbed to the disease in the morning of April 14, 2007. Callwood was last seen on TV on April 2, 2007 in the CBC show The Hour, interviewed by George Stroumboulopoulos. A biography, written by Anne Dublin and entitled June Callwood: A Life of Action, was published in March 2007.  Activism  Despite her rich career, Callwood felt the strong urge to not simply write about the injustice she came across as a journalist, but also to intervene. Charities Callwood founded include: * Digger House (established in the 1960s), a shelter for homeless youth * Nellie's (1974), one of Canada's first shelters for women in crisis * Jessie's Centre (1982), a centre for pregnant teens and young mothers *Casey House (1988) a residence fr patients with HIV/AIDS. At the beginning of its establishment, Casey House was the first hospice in the world to provide support and palliative care for people with HIV/AIDS. Callwood was also a founding member of PEN Canada and Maggie's Toronto Prostitutes' Community Service Project. She fought for women's right to reproductive choice at a particularly contentious time. She also co-founded the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and Feminists Against Censorship, wading into three bitter debates about pornography and freedom of expression. Honours In 1978, Callwood was made a member of the Order of Canada. She was promoted to Officer in 1985, and promoted again to Companion in 2000. In 1988, she was awarded the Order of Ontario. She was inducted into the Etobicoke Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2004, the City of Toronto noted its intention to name a street in Callwood's honour. Callwood requested that an existing street not be renamed for her, and specified that it be a new or currently unnamed street near a school or a playground. June Callwood Way is in the neighbourhood of Queen Street East and Broadview Avenue. June Callwood was named Toronto Humanist of the Year 2004 by The Humanist Association of Toronto. This yearly honour is presented by H.A.T. to men and women who, in their actions, and creative endeavours, exemplify the principles of Humanism: a commitment to reason, compassion, ethics and human dignity. In July 2005, a Toronto park Toronto names park after June Callwood was named after Callwood. A professorship in social justice was also established at Victoria College, University of Toronto in her honour.Callwood honoured with professorship In 2008, Premier Dalton McGuinty declared June 2 of every year to be June Callwood Day. In 2011, June Rose Callwood Public School, located at 84 Edward Street in St. Thomas, Ontario, was named in her honour. Personal life Callwood and Frayne had four children together: two daughters and two sons. The daughters are noted authors Jesse and Jill Frayne, and the elder son is Brant Frayne. The second son and youngest child, Casey Frayne, was killed on April 19, 1982, when he was 20 years old, by a drunk driver on Highway 401 as he returned home from Queen's University. Callwood's death came only days before the 25th anniversary of her son's death. Despite Callwood's accomplished activism career, she faced obstacles that attacked her public image. In 1968 she was arrested and briefly spent time in the Don Jail after siding with homeless Yorkville kids in a battle with police. But her most painful passage was in 1991, while on the board at Nellie's, when a number of women she considered friends failed to stand up for her in the face of unfounded allegations of racism. \\"Nobody asked what happened,\\" says Callwood, \\"you didn't have to do anything in those days. You just had to be in the way of legitimate rage. It woke people up...but a few of us got our heads kicked in.\\"This controversy forced June to withdraw from public life for a time. Although many who knew her defended her vigorously, and some vindication came her way when she was awarded the Harmony Award in 2003 for her work in fighting discrimination, she was deeply wounded. Callwood eventually returned to work despite the damage done to her reputation, focusing most particularly on being spokesperson for the Campaign Against Child Poverty. During this low period of forced withdrawal from the public, at age 70 Callwood obtained her pilot's licence and maintained the licence throughout her life. \\"I wanted something to get above the muck and I guess I did it more literally than most people,\\" June said. In response to all of the honours Callwood had received, she was known to laugh at the irony of all these accolades for a high-school dropout \\"with a criminal record,\\" she was always quick to add. Although Callwood was regularly dubbed \\"Canada's Conscience,\\" \\"Canada's Mother Theresa\\" and \\"Saint June\\" by the media, she generally shied away from organized religion. \\"I am missing a formal religion, but I am not without a theology, and my theology is that kindness is a divinity in motion,\\" she said in a 2005 speech delivered as the first lecture in the June Callwood Professorship in Social Justice at Victoria College at the University of Toronto.

He has the record of being the 2nd all-time leading scorer for the Ecuador national football team with 26 goals in 74 caps.rsssf: Ecuador record international footballers He has played for teams in his home nation as well as Mexico, the United States, Scotland, Switzerland, Chile and Argentina. He was one of the early stars of America's Major League Soccer (MLS) scoring the second most goals in the league's opening season and helping the Los Angeles Galaxy make a run for the playoffs. He was active for nearly 20 years, retiring at age 40 in 2010. Career Hurtado, nicknamed El Tanque (\\"The Tank\\") for his towering frame and his aggressive playing style (trying to roll over everything in his path), has played for many teams in different countries. His first teams were now defunct Valdez Sporting Club from Milagro and Emelec from Guayaquil, in his native Ecuador, and he also had stops in Switzerland, Chile, Mexico, the United States, Argentina, and Scotland. He later returned to Ecuador. =Major League Soccer= Hurtado was one of the early stars of Major League Soccer (MLS). In 1996, the league's first year, he finished second in goals, scoring 21 for the Los Angeles Galaxy. He added three in the playoffs as Galaxy fell short in the MLS Cup final and was named to the MLS Best XI after the season. After only eight goals in 1997, Hurtado was traded to the MetroStars two games into the 1998 season and finished the year with 11 goals and 15 assists (10 and 14 of those for the Metros), plus added a goal in the playoffs. And then 1999 came. After scoring two goals in the Metro season opener, Hurtado scored just five the rest of the way. Playing for one of the worst teams in league history, he was the epitome of everything wrong with the squad, missing easy sitters and empty nets game after game. El Tanque became known as El Tanque, and the Metros let him go on waivers after the season. The New England Revolution picked him up, but he only lasted three goalless games there before getting his release. =Post-MLS Career= Since his departure from MLS, Hurtado played for Liga Deportiva Universitaria, Argentinos Juniors and then Hibernian, where he joined international teammate Ulises De La Cruz. Hurtado's spell with Hibernian was an unhappy one, as he was signed by Alex McLeish, who soon left the club to join Rangers. Hurtado was ineffective and was given a free transfer by Bobby Williamson. He then played for Barcelona S.C., El Nacional, the team of Universidad de Concepción, and Audaz Octubrino from Machala. In 2004, he came back to the United States to play indoor soccer, signing with the Cleveland Force of the MISL in December. However, he couldn't adjust to the indoor game and was released in less than a month, going back to Ecuador to play for Olmedo, in 2006 he played for the 2nd Division club Norte America. He surprisingly announced that he would transfer to Colombian football to sign for the 1st Division Club Deportivo Pereira. The Recordman said: \\"I feel like I'm 20 years old, I want to score in Colombia\\" in an interview with a local TV. In 2008, he plays in San Camilo of Ecuadorian Second Division. Finally he decided to play his final season at 40 years old with the oldest team in Ecuador, Club Sport Patria in the Second Division.

Dawson played An Evening of Awesome at Carnegie Hall with John Green and Hank Green on January 15, 2013. On February 11, 2013, Dawson released her first music video as The Uncluded on YouTube, a group featuring Aesop Rock and herself. The single is titled \\"Earthquake\\". Their debut album Hokey Fright was released on May 7, 2013. The video for their third single \\"Delicate Cycle\\" has a cameo of Lil Bub. Personal life A sometime resident of Bedford Hills, New York, Dawson moved in December 2005 — with her mother, father, brother, Akida Junglefoot Dawson, and nephew — to Seattle, Washington. She went to the University of California, Los Angeles and participated in improv comedy on UCLA's Rapid Fire Improv. In 2006, she married musician Angelo Spencer. In July 2006, Dawson gave birth to a child, Panda, and in November 2006 she moved with her new family to Olympia, Washington. Dawson is good friends with WWE wrestler Bryan Danielson (aka Daniel Bryan), who appears as a guest artist on the Thunder Thighs track \\"Captain Lou\\", a cover of a NRBQ song written in homage to wrestling manager Lou Albano. On Christmas Day in Port Townsend, Washington in 1998, Dawson accidentally overdosed on whiskey and prescription pills. She suffered a grand mal seizure and vomited blood, which she then inhaled. To the surprise of her doctors, she woke up from a coma in a hospital the next day. Dawson once inadvertently started a rumor that she was a cousin of The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti.Dawson’s Crack (Interview w/Kimya Dawson). Monsterfresh.com (March 19, 2008).

History 937\\\\. The town of Kirchhain was built by Margrave Gero. A document written in 1005 mentions the town Doberlug (Dobraluh) for the first time. In 1165 the Cistercian Dobrilugk Abbey was founded by Margrave Dietrich of Landsberg. 1235\\\\. Kirchhain received market-rights. In 1431 the Hussites destroyed the town of Doberlug and the abbey was devastated. In 1637 and 1643 the Swedes destroyed Kirchhain. 1848\\\\. The jurisdictions of Doberlug and Kirchhain were unified, but the actual merger of the two towns did not take place until over one hundred years later, in 1950. During World War II, Kirchhain was taken by the Red Army on 23 April 1945. On August 28, 1992, the Amt Doberlug-Kirchhain was created to streamline the administration of the town together with the surrounding 8 small municipalities. Nexdorf and Frankena later joined as well. The municipalities incorporated into the town were Frankena (2000), Dübrichen, Hennersdorf, Nexdorf, Prießen and Werenzhain (2001), and Buchhain (2002). The remaining three municipalities Arenzhain, Trebbus and Lugau were incorporated on October 26, 2003, thus ending the history of the Amt.

Although concentrated in Europe, they are found in many parts of the world, probably because of their simple construction and universal purpose. In Britain, most of them were built between 2200BC and 1100BC. https://heritagecalling.com/2015/07/10/a-brief-introduction-to-bronze-age- barrows/. This was the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age. Later Iron Age barrows were mostly different, and sometimes square.Two Iron Age round barrows and a Bronze Age round barrow  Description  At its simplest, a round barrow is a hemispherical mound of earth and/or stone raised over a burial placed in the middle. Beyond this there are numerous variations which may employ surrounding ditches, stone kerbs or flat berms between ditch and mound. Construction methods range from a single creation process of heaped material to a complex depositional sequence involving alternating layers of stone, soil and turf with timbers or wattle used to help hold the structure together. The center may be placed a stone chamber or cist or in a cut grave. Both intact inhumations and cremations placed in vessels can be found. Many round barrows attract surrounding satellite burials or later ones inserted into the mound itself. In some cases these occur hundreds or even thousands of years after the original barrow was built and were placed by entirely different cultures. Numerous subtypes include the bell barrow, bowl barrow, saucer barrow and disc barrow.  Examples  = Scandinavia =  Denmark  Denmark has many tumuli, including round barrows. The round barrows here, were built over a very broad span of time and culture, from the Neolithic Stone Age to the Viking Age and show a large variation of construction design, while sharing a common exterior look.Dictionary: Rundhøj Alt om Fortidsminder (Denmarks' Cultural Heritage agency) Tumulis were protected by law in 1937. File:Loddenhøj.jpgLoddenhøj near Aarhus. Many smaller round barrows in Denmark are encircled by agricultural fields. File:Tinghøj Hammershøj Kvorning 2010-01-08 2.jpgTinghøjen near Randers. Many barrows are overgrown by shrubs or trees. File:Jelling church and burrows.jpgThe two round barrows at Jelling from the Viking Age, are the youngest in Denmark. = Britain = In Britain round barrows generally date to the Early Bronze Age although Neolithic examples are also known. Later round barrows were also sometimes used by Roman, Viking and Saxon societies. Examples include Rillaton barrow and Round Loaf.

It is six kilometres (four miles) southwest of Lybster on the A9 road to Helmsdale, near the junction with the A99 road to Wick, which lies in the equally small village of Latheron. The village is at the mouth of a wide valley, through which flows a small river called the Burn of Latheronwheel. It was built on the land of one Captain Dunbar (who had actually wished for it to be called Janetston, after his wife). It was a planned settlement, begun in 1835 with the building of a hotel (then known as 'Dunbar's Hotel' but today as 'The Blends' - due to its proprietor in the 1890s penchant for blending whisky from stills of dubious legality). In the beginning, tenants of the settlement were allocated and the right to fish from the harbour. The harbour was constructed around 1840, with a small lighthouse (soon disused) built on the southern headland. At one time was the home of 50 boats although few now remain. Initially salmon was caught, but this gave way to herring. The village is home to the four star Craiglea holiday complex which includes a swimming pool, something unique to this area of Scotland.

It lies on the left bank of the River Seine, some eight kilometres from the centre of Paris in the north- western suburbs of the French capital. Name Avenue de la Marne Asnières- sur-Seine was originally known simply as Asnières. The name was recorded for the first time in a papal bull of 1158 – as Asnerias, from Medieval Latin asinaria, meaning \\"donkey farm\\". The poor soil of Asnières, where heather grew in medieval times, was probably deemed suitable only for the breeding of donkeys. By the early 20th century it had become a favourite boating centre for Parisians, and its industries included boat building. On 15 February 1968 the commune was officially renamed Asnières-sur-Seine to distinguish it from other French communes also called Asnières. Demographics =Immigration= Departmental representation The commune is divided between two cantons (departmental constituencies): *Asnières-sur-Seine: composed of part of the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Currently represented by Josiane Fischer (UDI) and André Mancipoz (LR). *Courbevoie-1: composed of part of the commune of Courbevoie and of the remainder of the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine.

Line 1 of the Île- de-France tramway also serves the metro station at Les Courtilles, connecting it to Noisy-le-Sec. Trains on Lines J (Gisors) and L (Cergy) of the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail network call at Asnières-sur-Seine station, while those on Line L (Cergy) also serve Bois-Colombes station which lies just outside the western limit of the commune. A number of bus routes – lines 140, 165, 175, 177, and 276 – run through Asnières and connect it to its neighbouring communes. =Roads= Car traffic in Asnières is difficult. Most of the traffic is on the banks of the Seine around the city. The crossing of the Asnières bridge is extremely crowded and slow during peak hours. The Grand rue Charles-de-Gaulle then the Avenue d'Argenteuil are also difficult to pass because serving Bois-Colombes and northern towns. Moreover, the city has very few parking spaces, and garages and private parking spaces are scarce and expensive. Between 2010 and 2013, there was a development plan to change the streets of the city being one-way and become practicable in both directions for bicycles. Sport In addition to the Courtilles ice rink, the town has ten gyms, six stadiums, a shooting range, two tennis clubs (Azur Tennis Club and the Tennis Club du Ménil), a skate park, a Parisian boules court and a swimming pool. The Asnières Volley 92 participates in Ligue B (2nd national level) and plays at the Courtilles gymnasium. The city also has a handball club in agreement with neighboring cities. For the 2017-2018 season, the first team evolves in Pool 2 in National 2. Finally, the city counts, with the Molosses, an American football club, created in 1992, evolving in Casque d'Or (D2), 2-time vice-champion of France of D1 (1999, and 2014). A full-contact club, known as ABC (Asnieres Boxing Club) is also managed by a coaching team composed with ex-France and European champions. Around 100 members take part in trainings three times a Week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The judo and jujitsu club Arts Martiaux d'Asnières uses several of the town's gyms. Asnières in art =Georges Seurat= Bathers at Asnières by Georges Seurat depicts a scene of 19th century leisure and developing industry in this suburb of Paris. Between 1884 and 1886 Seurat painted Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte, using a new technique – which came to be known as pointillism – of forming an image from patterns of tiny coloured dots. =Vincent van Gogh= Vincent van Gogh made a series of paintings of Asnières. Influenced by impressionism and pointillism, he modified his traditional style and used vivid colour, shorter brushstrokes, and perspective to engage the viewer. His views of the banks of the Seine represent an important progression towards his later landscape paintings. In Asnières, within walking distance of his brother Theo's flat in Montmartre, van Gogh painted parks, cafés, restaurants, and the river.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a Bronze Age round barrow in Cornwall, UK. The site is on the eastern flank of Bodmin Moor in the parish of Linkinhorne about four miles (6 km) north of Liskeard.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston Rillaton Barrow was excavated in 1837 and found to contain a centrally-placed inhumation beneath the 25m wide barrow. The burial had been placed in a stone cist measuring 2m by almost 1m. Human remains were found along with grave goods including the Rillaton Gold Cup, a bronze dagger, beads, pottery, glass and other items. Rillaton Gold Cup Most notably, the burial contained the Rillaton Gold Cup, a biconical gold vessel, about 90 mm high, with a handle attached with rivets. The cup resembles a late Neolithic (approx 2300 BC) ceramic beaker with corded decoration and until 2007 was thought to date to a much later period of c. 1650-1400 BC. In 2001 the similar Ringlemere Cup was found which has a similar corded style termed grooved ware, though it was (and remains) crushed nearly flat. Subsequent theories that it might have been deposited as a votive offering have now been abandoned in favour of it being part of the original grave goods in the Ringlemere barrow. It has been suggested that the cup shows an Aegean style and resembles similar finds from the Greek site of Mycenae, suggesting cultural and trading links with the Eastern Mediterranean. The Rillaton Cup and the Pelynt Dagger are two artefacts that have been found in Cornwall that have been claimed to show contact with the Mycenaean world.Christie, P. M. \\"Cornwall in the Bronze Age\\" in: Cornish Archaeology; 25 However a 2006 study by Stuart Needham and others sees no reason to look so far afield for parallels, and locates them in a group with other \\"unstable\\" cups (round-bottomed and unable to stand up) in precious materials found in north-western Europe.Needham et al., 53-63 They propose a date around 1700 BC for the Rillaton Cup, though it may have been buried a long time after it was made.Needham et al., 60-63 In contrast, the Pelynt Dagger might actually be Mycenaean. After their discovery in 1837 the finds were sent as Duchy Treasure trove to King William IV, and remained in the royal household. After the death of King George V in 1936 the importance of the cup and associated dagger came to be appreciated, leading to their loan to the British Museum,The Rillaton Gold Cup British Museum. where the cup remains on show next to the similar Ringlemere Cup, though still belonging to the Royal Collection. The other objects found with the cup have now disappeared, and \\"no useful descriptions or depictions are known\\"; they might well have helped assess the date.Needham et al., 61, and catalogue entry A replica of the cup is in the Royal Cornwall Museum at Truro. A legend associated with the cup is that Rillaton is haunted by the spirit of a druid priest, who offers travellers a drink from an undrainable cup. One night a traveller threw the cup's contents at the ghost, and was later found dead in a ravine.

It was commissioned by Empress/Tsarina Catherine II (Catherine the Great) (1729–1796, reigned 1762–1796), built nearby the earlier Catherine Palace for her favorite grandson, Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, the future emperor (tsar/czar) Alexander I of Russia (1777–1825, reigned 1801–1825), on the occasion of his 1793 marriage to Grand Duchess Elizaveta Alexeievna, born Princess Luise Marie Augusta of Baden. The Neoclassical edifice was planned by Giacomo Quarenghi and built between 1792 and 1796. It was agreed that the architect had excelled himself in creating a masterpiece.The Alexander Palace by I.Bott & V.Faybisovich 1977 In 1821, a quarter of a century later, the architect's son wrote: Home of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Alexeievna Alexander used the palace as a summer residence through the remainder of his grandmother's and his father, Paul's, reign. When he became emperor, however, he chose to reside in the much larger nearby Catherine Palace. Under Nicholas I Emperor Nicholas I by Franz Krüger The Dowager Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in 1860, the year of her death Alexander I gave the palace to his brother, the future Nicholas I, for summer usage. From that time on, it was the summer residence of the heir to the throne. From 1830 to 1850, extensive redecoration was carried out according to designs by D.Cerfolio, A.Thon, D.Yefimov, A.Stakenschneider and others in keeping with rapidly changing tastes. The appearance of the formal and private rooms of the palace during Nicholas' reign can be seen in exquisite watercolors by E. Hau, I. Premazzi and I. Volsky from 1840 to 1860.The Alexander Palace The famous Mountain Hall which had a large slide built in for the children of Nicholas I was built during this time. Nicholas I and his family lived in the palace from the early spring till the end of May and after a short period at Krasnoye Selo during manoeuvres returned to the palace to spend their time there until the late autumn. In 1842, the Imperial couple celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with a series of galas including a medieval jousting tournament. Two years later, the family mourned the death of Nicholas's daughter Grand Duchess Alexandra (1825–1844), who was born at the palace and lived the last few months of her life there. On 19 October 1860, the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna also died at the palace. Under Alexander III and Maria Feodorovna Alexander III and his Danish born wife Maria Feodorovna had their apartments in the right-hand or western wing of the palace near the gardens. Before their accession to the imperial throne, Maria gave birth to their eldest child, the future Nicholas II, at the Alexander Palace. In his diary, the then Tsarevich Alexander recorded the momentous event of the birth of his first child, Empress Maria Feodorovna on holiday in Copenhagen in 1893. The entire imperial family was present at the birth of Alexander and Maria's first child. In a letter to her mother, Queen Louise, the Tsarevna wrote, After Alexander III's death, Maria Feodorovna would stay at the palace in their rooms while visiting her son (Tsar Nicholas II) and daughter-in-law (Alexandra Feodorovna). As the estrangement with Alexandra Feodorovna became more apparent, the visits of the Dowager Empress became fewer. Under Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna The Russian Imperial Family, 1913.

Members of the Imperial family in Kegresse track car at Alexander Palace, January 1917 The palace is most famous though for the role it played in the reign of the last tsar, Nicholas II. He and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna always loved the palace and decided to make it their permanent residence after the events of Bloody Sunday, which made the Winter Palace dangerous for them. They remodeled the former two-story ballroom into the Maple Room and the New Study and added rooms for their children on the floor above. To the horror of the court, Alexandra, and her architect Meltzer, chose a then-modern style of decoration, Jugendstil or Art Nouveau, considered by the aristocracy to be \\"middle class\\" and less than \\"Imperial\\". One of these most famous rooms is Alexandra's Mauve Room . tiny model of the palace, by Peter Carl Fabergé During the reign of Nicholas II, the palace was wired for electricity and equipped with a telephone system. In 1899, a hydraulic lift was installed connecting the Empress' suite with the children's rooms on the second floor. Furthermore, with the advent of motion pictures, a screening booth was built in the Semicircular Hall to show films. During the stormy years of war and revolution, the monumental walls of the Alexander Palace sheltered the Imperial Family from the outside world. Pierre Gilliard, tutor to Nicholas II's son, had free access to this inner sanctum. In his memoirs, the tutor later described that the family life at Tsarskoe Selo was less formal than at other residences. Apart from a few exceptions, the court did not reside at the palace. The Imperial Family would gather informally around the table at mealtimes without attendants, unless relatives were visiting.Emperor Nicholas II and His Family (Leningrad 1990) p. 59 Romanovs under house arrest One of the last photographs taken of Nicholas II, showing him at Tsarskoye Selo after his abdication in March 1917 Nicholas II abdicated the throne of Russia on 2 March 1917. Thirteen days later, he returned to the Alexander Palace not as Emperor of Russia, but as Colonel Romanov. The Imperial Family were now held under house arrest and confined to a few rooms of the palace and watched over by a guard with fixed bayonets.Nicholas II by O. Barkovets and V. Tenikhina (St. Petersburg 2004) The regime of their captivity, worked out by Alexander Kerensky himself, envisaged strict limitations in the life of the Imperial Family: an isolation from the outer world, a guard during their promenades in the park, prohibition of any contacts and correspondence apart from approved letters. Gillard noted, Due to an increasingly precarious situation in St. Petersburg, the leader of the provisional government, Alexander Kerensky, made the decision to move the Romanov family out of the palace into internal exile in Tobolsk in far away Siberia. There had been calls for the prisoners to be housed in the prison at the notorious Fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul in St. Petersburg. To avoid this on the morning of 1 August 1917, a train took the family away. They were never to return. After the Romanovs Not long after the departure of the Romanovs for Siberia, a museum was established within the Alexander Palace. It operated until the beginning of the Second World War. At the beginning of the war, the most valuable furnishings were evacuated to the interior of the country. The remaining parts of the collection were hidden in the basement. German occupation during the Second World War During the Nazi German occupation, the palace was used as headquarters for the German military command. The area in front of the palace was turned into a cemetery for SS soldiers. Artistically and historically unique collections were partially destroyed. As the German forces were leaving the Soviet Union, many of the former imperial palaces were set ablaze. The Alexander Palace was spared. After the war After the expulsion of the German forces, the palace was used as a depot for artworks coming back into the area. The neighbouring Catherine Palace had been looted and mostly destroyed. For a time it was planned to restore the interiors of the Alexander Palace, but this decision was reversed. As interest in Nicholas II and his family was discouraged by the Soviet regime, so too was interest in the palace that had been their residence. The new plan was to create a museum to Pushkin. With the exception of the heavily damaged Reception and New Study, the private rooms of the imperial family were altered to plain exhibition halls. The museum plan was then shelved, and the palace was handed over to the Soviet Navy. Many of the palace's former collections still existed, but were relocated to other museums such as the Pavlovsk Palace. The Alexander Palace was seen as little more than an enhancement to the beautiful Alexander Park.  Recent history  When it appeared that the Soviet Navy intended to vacate the complex, the Alexander Palace was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund (WMF). With funding from American Express in the same year, WMF helped with emergency renovations to the roof over the Nicholas II left wing of the palace, comprising approximately one-third of the building's total roof structure. Portrait of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, 1907 by Nikolai Bodarevsky The Semi-Circular Hall, after the 2010 restoration In the summer of 1997, a permanent exhibition was opened dedicated to the imperial family. Certain elements of the Reception Room, Nicholas II's New Study and Alexandra Feodorovna's Drawing Room were recreated to provide a backdrop for exhibitions of historical costumes, weapons and objects of applied art. A portrait of Alexandra Feodorovna by Friedrich von Kaulbach was returned to its original position. Clothing worn by the last imperial family and uniforms related to the court of Tsar Nicholas II were also placed on display. Much of this clothing only survived because it had been used as packing case wadding for more precious objects when the palace was evacuated in World War II. In 2010 the three largest public rooms in the middle wing were reopened, following partial restoration: the Semi-Circular Hall, the Portrait Hall and the Marble Drawing Room. However, despite the best efforts of curators, limited restoration funds, dispersed collections, and the absence of the palms and flowers – from now vanished imperial hothouses – that had once lushly decorated several of the rooms, meant that the presentations were somewhat sparse and of varying quality. In 2014 the Russian government finally allocated significant funds to enable a more complete and authentic restoration of the quarters of the imperial family. This will include the Art Nouveau Maple Room, and the celebrated Mauve Room of Alexandra. In September 2015 the palace closed to the public for this major multi-year project.

Starting at SR 424 (Edgewater Drive) just north of Orlando city limits, the road runs north as Forest City Road through Forest City before dropping the name at the Seminole County line. SR 434 continues north and east through Altamonte Springs and Longwood before turning south and east through Winter Springs and Oviedo. SR 434 is called Central Avenue when it first turns south towards downtown Oviedo. After going through downtown Oviedo, SR 434 is called Alafaya Trail from its intersection with Mitchell Hammock Road south to the Orange County line to its end at SR 50 (Colonial Drive). The road continues south as Alafaya Trail only without the state road designation. Alafaya meets with State Road 50 in Union Park, FL. West of Oviedo SR 434 is signed east- west, south of Oviedo it is signed north-south. Route description In Seminole County, official maps show SR 434 as being named Sanlando Springs Road through Longwood and Sanford-Oviedo Road through Winter Springs. The road is referred to locally as simply State Road 434, Highway 434, Route 434 or just as 434. SR 434 is called Alafaya Trail from Mitchell Hammock Road in Oviedo, continuing south into Orange County, to its end at SR 50 (Colonial Drive). Alafaya Trail continues south of Colonial Drive without the SR 434 designation. In the 1883 plat of Forest City Orange Park, a section of what is now SR 434 south of its intersection with SR 436 was named Bay Street. History SR 434 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as from a point on SR 436 South for approximately one mile then Northeast to Forest City, thence North and Northeasterly to Longwood, thence South to intersection with SR 436 East of Altamonte Springs; thence Southeasterly to intersection with SR 426 South of Gabriella. SR 431 was defined as from a point on the old Orlando- Apopka Road near the N.E. corner of Section 4, T. 22 S - R. 29 E. Northerly to intersection with SR 436 at Forest City The original route of SR 434 had it begin at SR 436 and Bear Lake Road, run south on Bear Lake Road, northeast on Bunnell Road, along the current SR 434 to Longwood, south on CR 427 and Anchor Road, southeast on current SR 436, south on Lake Howell Road, and east on Howell Branch Road to end at SR 426. At some point, Alafaya Trail from Oviedo south to SR 50 was added as an extension of SR 520. Also around the same time, SR 434 west of Forest City and east of Longwood was removed, and SR 434's east end was extended to SR 419. Eventually, around 1985, SR 434 was extended in both directions, south from the west end along SR 431 and east and south from the east end along SR 419 and SR 520 (which had, in the meantime, become County Road 520 on Alafaya Trail). In 2013, a short extension of SR 434 opened, connecting the road directly to SR 423 (John Young Parkway) via a flyover bridge across U.S. Route 441 (US 441 or Orange Blossom Trail). A major goal of this extension was to alleviate I-4 traffic. On June 2, 2018, a section of SR 434 in Oviedo was closed after an old drainage structure below the road collapsed and caused a wide hole to open up. The road reopened to traffic on June 8, 2018 after repairs were made.

He was the second Albertan appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, taking the place of Justice Nolan, who died after only a short time on the Court. Family life and education Ronald Martland was born in Liverpool, England in 1907. His family immigrated to Canada in 1911, when he was four years old.Alberta Order of Excellence citation He graduated from high school at the age of 14, but was too young to attend university, so he worked as a page in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for two years.Supreme Court of Canada biography Martland attended the University of Alberta and obtained a B.A. in 1926 and an LL.B in 1928. At law school, he led his class each year, and won the Chief Justice Harvey Gold Medal in his final year. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Hertford College, Oxford University. He received an additional BA in 1930 and a BCL in 1931. He was the first Canadian recipient of the Vinerian Prize. While at Oxford, he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. In 1935, he married Iris Euphemia Bury. They had three children: Patricia (b. 1936), John Gordon (b. 1942), and Bridget Elizabeth (b. 1945).The Peerage: Ronald Martland M, #361360 Career as a lawyer Martland was called to the bar of Alberta in 1932 and practised law at the firm of Milner, Carr, Dafoe & Poirier for over 25 years. He became a leading counsel in the courts of the province, as well as appearing before the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court for the British Commonwealth. He was a bencher of the Law Society of Alberta between 1948 and 1958. Supreme Court Justice Martland was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on January 15, 1958, on the nomination of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. He served on the Court as Puisne Justice for 24 years, participating in over 1,700 cases. Of these, he wrote the decision for the majority in some 230 cases and concurring judgments in more than 70 cases. He wrote dissenting judgments in some 40 cases. One of his most significant dissents, co-authored with Justice Ritchie, was in the Patriation Reference, where they argued that as a matter of constitutional law, the federal Parliament did not have the authority to unilaterally request that the British Parliament enact the proposed patriation constitutional amendments.Reference Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution (Patriation Reference), [1981] 1 SCR 753.Noel Lyon, \\"Constitutional Theory and the Martland-Ritchie Dissent\\" (1981) 7 Queen's L.J. 344. Although in dissent on the legal issue, Martland and Ritchie were in the majority on the second issue in the Reference, the existence of a constitutional convention which required a significant degree of provincial support for major constitutional amendments. In late 1973, Chief Justice Fauteux announced his retirement from the Court. Justice Martland was the senior puisne justice, and the long-standing tradition was that the most senior judge on the bench would be appointed chief justice. (At that time, the only exceptions to this custom were in 1906 and 1924, when the senior puisne justice had been passed over.) However, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau chose instead to appoint Bora Laskin as Chief Justice. Laskin was the second-most junior judge of the Court, and the appointment created considerable comment. It was said that Justice Martland had been given very little notice that he would be passed over, and was upset by it. The Finance Minister, John Turner, was rumoured to be furious at the departure from the traditions of the Court.James G. Snell and Frederick Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada: History of the Institution (Toronto: The Osgoode Society, 1985), pp. 224-225.

Close-up of the electrodes and the safety warning A germicidal lamp is an electric light that produces ultraviolet C (UVC) light. This short-wave ultraviolet light disrupts DNA base pairing, causing formation of pyrimidine dimers, and leads to the inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. It can also be used to produce ozone for water disinfection. There are four common types available: * Low-pressure mercury lamps * High-pressure mercury lamps * Excimer lamps * LEDs Low- pressure mercury lamps Low-pressure mercury lamps are very similar to a fluorescent lamp, with a wavelength of 253.7 nm (1182.5 THz). The most common form of germicidal lamp looks similar to an ordinary fluorescent lamp but the tube contains no fluorescent phosphor. In addition, rather than being made of ordinary borosilicate glass, the tube is made of fused quartz or vycor 7913 glass. These two changes combine to allow the 253.7 nm ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc to pass out of the lamp unmodified (whereas, in common fluorescent lamps, it causes the phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light). Germicidal lamps still produce a small amount of visible light due to other mercury radiation bands. An older design looks like an incandescent lamp but with the envelope containing a few droplets of mercury. In this design, the incandescent filament heats the mercury, producing a vapor which eventually allows an arc to be struck, short circuiting the incandescent filament. As with all gas-discharge lamps, low- and high-pressure mercury lamps exhibit negative resistance and require the use of an external ballast to regulate the current flow. The older lamps that resembled an incandescent lamp were often operated in series with an ordinary 40 W incandescent \\"appliance\\" lamp; the incandescent lamp acted as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. High-pressure mercury lamps High-pressure lamps are much more similar to HID lamps than fluorescent lamps. These lamps radiate a broad- band UVC radiation, rather than a single line. They are widely used in industrial water treatment, because they are very intense radiation sources. High-pressure lamps produce very bright bluish white light. Excimer lamps Excimer lamps emit narrow-band UVC and vacuum-ultraviolet radiation at a variety of wavelengths depending on the medium. They are mercury-free and reach full output quicker than a mercury lamp, and generate less heat. Excimer emission at 207 and 222 nm appears to be safer than traditional 254 nm germicidal radiation, due to greatly reduced penetration of these wavelengths in human skin.  Light emitting diodes (LEDs)  UVC LED lamp with heatsink and power source Recent developments in light-emitting diode (LED) technology have led to the commercial availability of UVC LED sources. UVC LEDs use semiconductor materials to produce light in a solid-state device. The wavelength of emission is tuneable by adjusting the chemistry of the semiconductor material, giving a selectivity to the emission profile of the LED across, and beyond, the germicidal wavelength band. Advances in understanding and synthesis of the AlGaN materials system led to significant increases in the output power, device lifetime, and efficiency of UVC LEDs in the early 2010s. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices. Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications. By 2019 LEDs made up 41.4% of UV Light Sales, up from 19.2% in 2014 The UV-C LED global market is expected to rise from $223m in 2017 to US$991m in 2023. Uses Germicidal lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. If the quartz envelope transmits shorter wavelengths, such as the 185 nm mercury emission line, they can also be used wherever ozone is desired, for example, in the sanitizing systems of hot tubs and aquariums. They are also used by geologists to provoke fluorescence in mineral samples, aiding in their identification. In this application, the light produced by the lamp is usually filtered to remove as much visible light as possible, leaving just the UV light. Germicidal lamps are also used in waste water treatment in order to kill microorganisms. An EPROM. The small quartz window allows UV light to enter during erasure. The light produced by germicidal lamps is also used to erase EPROMs; the ultraviolet photons are sufficiently energetic to allow the electrons trapped on the transistors' floating gates to tunnel through the gate insulation, eventually removing the stored charge that represents binary ones and zeroes. Ozone production For most purposes, ozone production would be a detrimental side effect of lamp operation. To prevent this, most germicidal lamps are treated to absorb the 185 nm mercury emission line (which is the longest wavelength of mercury light which will ionize oxygen). In some cases (such as water sanitization), ozone production is precisely the point. This requires specialized lamps which do not have the surface treatment. Safety concerns Short-wave UV light is harmful to humans. In addition to causing sunburn and (over time) skin cancer, this light can produce extremely painful inflammation of the cornea of the eye, which may lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment. For this reason, the light produced by a germicidal lamp must be carefully shielded against direct viewing, with consideration of reflections and dispersed light. A February 2017 risk analysis of UVC lights concluded that ultraviolet light from these lamps can cause skin and eye problems.

History On the outskirts of Farley Green, lies Farley Heath where one of Surrey's few Roman remains, a temple, can be found. The open heathland was the site of the largest Romano-British settlement in Surrey. The site was excavated in 1848 by Martin Tupper, an antiquarian and poet, who lived in nearby Albury. Some of his finds are now housed in the British Museum. A Romano-Celtic Temple was in use some time before the end of the 1st century AD and was believed to be destroyed by fire around 450 AD. A number of pottery kilns, dating to the third or fourth centuries were also found. A subsequent excavation took place in 1926 led by S.E.Winbolt. The most recent archaeological excavation was undertaken by Surrey County Archaeological Unit, funded by English Heritage, in 1995. The full report was published in Surrey Archaeological Collections in 2007. The outline of the temple can still be seen and is marked out by stones set in concrete. The pond located on the green was used as a latrine pit by those living in the temple. Topography The village houses spread mostly along Shophouse Lane which then becomes steep and narrow towards Winterfold Forest which ascends to more than 200 metres Above Ordnance Datum. The forest which climbs right to the summit of the Greensand Ridge is part of the Hurtwood and is where some of the Great Train Robbery proceeds were discovered, buried. The whole undulating area covering the south of Albury parish had been the haunt of smugglers in the distant past.The Good Move guide The hamlet has its own Anglican chapel, dedicated to St Michael, which is in a 19th-century barn built by the Albury Estate. It was later sold and the widow gave the barn to Albury parish. Edgeley Caravan Park is located off the main road in landscaped grounds. Notable residents * C. J.

It is a combination of two terms: \\"wire work\\" and \\"kung fu\\". Wire fu is used to describe a subgenre of kung fu movies where the stuntmen's or actor's skill is augmented with the use of wires and pulleys, as well as other stage techniques, usually to perform fight-scene stunts and give the illusion of super-human ability (or qinggong). It is exemplified by the work of Tsui Hark, Yuen Woo-ping, and Jet Li. Hollywood has subsequently adapted the style for the American film industry. Almost all modern wuxia movies fall in this category. Not all martial arts films use wire work. In practice The basic concept is not very complex and originates in the mechanical effects of stagecraft. Planning and persistence is important, as it often requires many takes to perfect the stunt. Typically, a harness is hidden under the actor's costume, and a cable and pulley system is attached to the harness. When live sets are used, wire removal is done in post-production. Another later- developed technique of creating wire fu is using a greenscreen and post- production special effects. Greenscreening the wire work is done for more complex stunts and camera angles. The actors are suspended in the air by green wires, which are then erased digitally during the post-production process. The process by which this was done in older (pre-digital) movies was to use film coloration techniques in a method similar to animation; artists (usually animators), would painstakingly go frame by frame over the raw footage and color in the wires to match the background. Wire work is often used in kung fu movies to simply allow actors to perform stunts beyond their physical abilities. In films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it is used to create a more dramatic effect and adds magical realism to the world in which the film takes place.

Early life and career Walker was born near Russelville in Logan County, Kentucky. He attended private schools in Kentucky and Tennessee and studied law. He moved to Florida in 1837, settling in Leon County. His father was David Walker, a prominent early Kentucky politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives. David S. Walker was a cousin and close business and political confidante of Florida territorial governor Richard K. Call. He was also related to Florida Senator Wilkinson Call, who was Walker's law partner for several years in the 1850s and 1860s in Tallahassee. Walker entered politics as a Whig, and was elected to the first session of the Florida State Legislature in 1845, serving Wakulla and Leon Counties as senator. In 1848, he was elected by Leon County to the Florida House of Representatives. In 1849 he was appointed Register of Public Lands and was ex officio State Superintendent of Public Instruction, positions he held until 1854. He advocated and promoted interest in public schools. His efforts resulted in the creation of public schools in Tallahassee. He served as Mayor of Tallahassee. He was the Know Nothing gubernatorial candidate in 1856 but lost to Democrat Madison S. Perry by 2.6 points. In 1859, he became a Florida Supreme Court Justice. Walker is also known for establishing Tallahassee's first library in the mid-1800s through his private funds in a time where money was not allocated to libraries outside of urban areas, especially in a \\"rural\\" state.Springtime Tallahassee, “About Us,” http://www.springtimetallahassee.com.Pearia, A. A. (2007). Preserving the past: Library development in Florida and the New Deal, 1933-1942. Electronic Theses, Treatises and Dissertations. Paper 2058. Florida State University. Governorship Prior to the Civil War, Walker was a Constitutional Unionist and so had opposed secession. However, when Florida seceded from the Union in 1861, he supported his state. Following the war, on November 29, 1865, Walker was elected governor unopposed, in an election in which newly freed slaves were not allowed to participate. He was inaugurated on December 20 and took office January 18, 1866. During his governorship, Florida transitioned from the federal oversight and military occupation of Reconstruction to readmission into the Union, but Walker was a conservative who attempted to minimize changes to the antebellum social, political, and economic system. He protested the election of the 1868 Constitutional Convention, which was convened to adopt a new government that the Republican U.S. Congress would approve, but ultimately supported the 1868 Constitution when it turned out to be less protective of blacks than originally anticipated. He ran for reelection in 1868 as an Independent Republican, but lost to Republican Harrison Reed, coming in third place with under 10% of the vote. After leaving the governor's office on July 4, 1868, he returned to practicing law. In 1878, he was appointed circuit court judge, a position he held until his death on July 20, 1891.

The game was written by Dave Lebling and inspired by the horror fiction writings of H. P. Lovecraft (including his Cthulhu Mythos). Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several platforms simultaneously thanks to the Z-machine. The original release included versions for DOS, the Apple II, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Later, it was ported to the Amiga with the addition of sound effects, making it the first title with that feature. The effects would play at appropriate times in the game in an effort to intensify the horror atmosphere. This marked one of the few major additions to the Z-machine with the exception of graphics; traditionally, Infocom had eschewed such changes in favor of expanding the parser capacity and overall size of game files. It was Infocom's 26th game; Infocom rated it as \\"Standard\\" in terms of difficulty. Lurking Horror was the only horror game ever released by Infocom. Plot The game starts with the player trying to finish a term paper at G.U.E. Tech, a large MIT-like American university. The player has braved a snowstorm to travel to the school's computer lab to work on the report. The document is now mangled beyond repair, however; with the help of a hacker, the player finds that the file has been partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy's files. Although the game begins as a quest to try to salvage the term paper, alarming events soon unfold, revealing a powerful evil within the school's depths. What began as a mere snowstorm has strengthened into a full-force blizzard. The player must traverse the University grounds in an attempt to recover the term paper's data. Much of the campus is deserted and covered in snowdrifts, rendering walkways impassable. The only accessible avenues are steam tunnels and a small complex of buildings. In the course of unraveling the mystery, the player encounters demons, zombies, and sinister references to a recent campus suicide. Failing to set things right in the hidden passages beneath the school will result in a literal fate worse than death. Development and release The name of the university, G.U.E. Tech, is an obvious nod to Infocom's Zork games, which are set in the Great Underground Empire. In The Lurking Horror, G.U.E. Tech is an abbreviation for \\"George Underwood Edwards Institute of Technology\\". Many features of G.U.E. Tech, including the steam tunnels, are modeled after MIT, which many of Infocom's developers attended. In particular, the Infinite Corridor is a central feature of the MIT campus, and a door marked \\"Department of Alchemy\\" actually exists in Building 2 thanks to a late-20th-century hack. All of Infocom's game packages since Deadline included extra content in their game packages called \\"feelies\\". The feelies for The Lurking Horror included: a student ID card; \\"G.U.E. at a Glance\\", a guide for freshmen of the school, including maps of the campus and buildings and background information on the school; a rubber centipede-like creature reminiscent of one of the monsters in the game (this was not mentioned on the package, and made for a creepy moment even before the user played the game). In addition to maps and other information necessary to complete the game, the \\"G.U.E. at a Glance\\" booklet contains many jabs at technology-oriented schools like MIT and Caltech. These straight-faced jokes include \\"In spite of what your roommate will tell you, G.U.E. Tech does not have the highest suicide rate in the country\\" and \\"Women: There's no need to go anywhere. With a male/female ratio of 6:1, someone WILL say hello to you.\\" G.U.E. Tech's motto, seen on the student ID card in the feelies, is \\"Omne ignotum pro magnifico\\", a Latin phrase meaning \\"Everything unknown is taken for magnificent.\\", taken from Tacitus (Agricola), Book 1, 30. Reception The game was very well received. Computer Gaming World wrote of Lurking, \\"Stephen King couldn't have done it better\\". In 1996, Next Generation ranked it as the 24th top game of all time, calling it \\"the best adventure game of all time,\\" as well as \\"one of only two in the horror genre that has ever seemed genuinely scary (Resident Evil is the other).\\" They elaborated that \\"Not only are the puzzles spot on genius, the writing is fantastic - a brilliant combination of the realism of Stephen King ... and the nameless, strangling horrors of H.P. Lovecraft.\\"Next Generation 21 (September 1996), p.63. In 1999, Next Generation listed The Lurking Horror as number 35 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Literate gamers not afraid of their keyboards will find an amazing world inside this text-only adventure game.\\" In 2004, The Lurking Horror ranked number 10 on GameSpy's list of the scariest games of all time.GameSpy: Top 10 Scariest Games References External links * *The Lurking Horror on the Amiga at the Hall of Light (HOL) *The Lurking Horror information from the Infocom Gallery with photos of the entire contents of the game (manual, feelies, etc.) *The Lurking Horror information from Infocom-if.org *More information on the game, including a transcript of typical gameplay and complete InvisiClues Category:1980s interactive fiction Category:1987 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Amstrad PCW games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari ST games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Horror video games Category:Infocom games Category:Mac OS games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"The Lurking Horror"},{"id":"1150159","text":"Six ships of the Royal Navy, have been named HMS Leander after the Greek hero Leander: * was a 52-gun fourth rate launched in 1780.

Career Jolley led Kempsville High School to back-to- back Virginia state championships. After playing college soccer at College of William and Mary, Jolley was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy with the ninth overall pick of the 1997 MLS College Draft. He spent the next three years in Los Angeles, switching from the midfield into defense as time went on. The lowlight of his Galaxy career came in the 1999 MLS Cup, when Jolley had to come into the game just nine minutes from the start for the injured Robin Fraser. Jolley scored four goals during his time with the Galaxy. He was traded to the MetroStars for a second-round draft pick after playing just four minutes for the Galaxy in 2000. He combined with Mike Petke and Daniel Hernández on an excellent three-man backline that helped the Metros rise in the MLS standings. Jolley would play every possible Metro minute of the 2000 and 2001 seasons. He finished his Metro career in 2003 with 104 league games and 129 in all competitions (both numbers third in team history), seven goals (eight in all competitions) and six assists. He also became prominent in the community and earned MLS Humanitarian of the Year honors in 2002 in part for his effort for 9/11 related charities. Jolley was traded to the then-Dallas Burn before the 2004 season for Tenywa Bonseu. He became a regular for Dallas, scoring one goal and starting almost every game, but also had a dubious distinction of scoring two own goals in one game (for Jolley, only one of those was attributed to him). After losing his starting job with the club in 2005, he was traded back to the MetroStars before the 2006 season. At the end of the year, he was waived by the team, which had become known as New York Red Bulls. After a brief retirement from soccer, he returned in 2007 to play for the Long Island Rough Riders in the Premier Development League.

A medicine wheel may also be a stone monument that illustrates this metaphor. Historically, the monuments were constructed by laying stones in a particular pattern on the ground oriented to the four directions. Most medicine wheels follow the basic pattern of having a center of stone, and surrounding that is an outer ring of stones with \\"spokes\\" (lines of rocks) radiating from the center to the cardinal directions (east, south, west, and north). These stone structures may or may not be called \\"medicine wheels\\" by the people whose ancestors built them, but may be called by more specific terms in that nation's language. Physical medicine wheels made of stone were constructed by several different indigenous peoples in North America, especially those of the Plains Indians. They are associated with religious ceremonies. As a metaphor, they may be used in healing work or to illustrate other cultural concepts. The medicine wheel has been adopted as a symbol by a number of pan-Indian groups, or other native groups whose ancestors did not traditionally use it as a symbol or structure. It has also been appropriated by non-indigenous people, usually those associated with New Age communities.  Nomenclature  Medicine Wheel in Bighorn National Forest, Wyoming The Royal Alberta Museum (2005) holds that the term \\"medicine wheel\\" was first applied to the Big Horn Medicine Wheel in Wyoming, the southernmost archeological wheel still extant.Source: (accessed: January 2, 2008) The term \\"medicine\\" was not applied because of any healing that was associated with the medicine wheel, but denotes that the sacred site and rock formations were of central importance and attributed with religious, hallowed, and spiritual significance. As a metaphor, the concept of the sacred hoop of life, also used by multiple Nations, is sometimes conflated with that of the medicine wheel. A 2007 Indian Country Today article on the history of the modern Hoop Dance defines the dancer's hoop this way: > The hoop is symbolic of \\"the never-ending circle of life.\\" It has no > beginning and no end.Zotigh, Dennis (30 May 2007). \\"History of the modern > Hoop Dance\\". Indian Country Today. Retrieved 12 February 2014.  Exegesis  = Stone structures as sacred architecture = Intentionally erecting massive stone structures as sacred architecture is a well-documented activity of ancient monolithic and megalithic peoples. What sets them apart from many of the other megalithic peoples is how non-intrusive and environmentally sensitive the footprint and fabrication of their structures were. Unlike some of the grand and towering stone monoliths found in Europe, the indigenous peoples of North America usually laid down smaller stones on the earth, rather than digging deep pits and erecting huge stones, such as at Stonehenge. The Royal Alberta Museum posits the possible point of origin, or parallel tradition, to other round structures such as the tipi lodge, stones used as \\"foundation stones\\" or \\"tent-pegs\\": > Scattered across the plains of Alberta are tens of thousands of stone > structures. Most of these are simple circles of cobble stones which once > held down the edges of the famous tipi of the Plains Indians; these are > known as \\"tipi rings.\\" Others, however, were of a more esoteric nature. > Extremely large stone circlessome greater than 12 meters acrossmay be the > remains of special ceremonial dance structures. A few cobble arrangements > form the outlines of human figures, most of them obviously male. Perhaps the > most intriguing cobble constructions, however, are the ones known as > medicine wheels. = Locality, siting and proxemics = Stone medicine wheels are sited throughout the northern United States and southern Canada, specifically South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Alberta and Saskatchewan. The majority of the approximately 70 documented stone structures still extant are in Alberta, Canada. One of the prototypical medicine wheels is in the Bighorn National Forest in Big Horn County, Wyoming. This wheel has 28 spokes, and is part of a vast set of old Native American sites that document 7,000 years of their history in that area. Medicine wheels are also found in Ojibwa territory, the common theory is that they were built by the prehistoric ancestors of the Assiniboine people. Larger astronomical and ceremonial petroforms, and Hopewell mound building sites are also found in North America. = Structure, fabrication and patterning = In defining the commonalities among different stone medicine wheels, the Royal Alberta Museum cites the definition given by John Brumley, an archaeologist from Medicine Hat, that a medicine wheel \\"consists of at least two of the following three traits: (1) a central stone cairn, (2) one or more concentric stone circles, and/or (3) two or more stone lines radiating outward from a central point.\\" From the air, Medicine wheels often look like a wagon wheel lying on its side. The wheels can be large, reaching diameters of 75 feet. The most common variation between different wheels are the spokes. There is no set number of spokes for a medicine wheel to have although there are usually 28, the same number of days in a lunar cycle. The spokes within each wheel are rarely evenly spaced, or even all the same length. Some medicine wheels will have one particular spoke that is significantly longer than the rest. The spokes may start from the center cairn and go out only to the outer ring, others go past the outer ring, and some spokes start at the outer ring and go out from there. Sometimes there is a passageway, or a doorway, in the circles. The outer ring of stones will be broken, and there will be a stone path leading in to the center of the wheel. Some have additional circles around the outside of the wheel, sometimes attached to spokes or the outer ring, and sometimes floating free of the main structure. While alignment with the cardinal directions is common, some medicine wheels are also aligned with astronomical phenomena involving the sun, moon, some stars, and some planets in relation to the Earth's horizon at that location. The wheels are generally considered to be sacred sites, connected in various ways to the builders' particular culture, lore and ceremonial ways. Other North American indigenous peoples have made somewhat- similar petroforms, turtle-shaped stone piles with the legs, head, and tail pointing out the directions and aligned with astronomical events. = Cultural value, attribution and meaning = Stone medicine wheels have been built and used for ceremonies for millennia, and each one has enough unique characteristics and qualities that archaeologists have encountered significant challenges in determining with precision what each one was for; similarly, gauging their commonality of function and meaning has also been problematic. One of the older wheels, the Majorville medicine wheel located south of Bassano, Alberta, has been dated at 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful stratification of known artifact types.The Majorville Cairn and Medicine Wheel Site, James M Calder, National Museum of Man Series, Archaeology Survey of Canada No. 62, Ottawa, 1977 Like Stonehenge, it had been built up by successive generations who would add new features to the circle. Due to that and its long period of use (with a gap in its use between 3000 and 2000 years ago, archaeologists believe that the function of the medicine wheel changed over time. Astronomer John Eddy put forth the suggestions that some of the wheels had astronomical significance, where spokes on a wheel could be pointing to certain stars, as well as sunrise or sunset, at a certain time of the year, suggesting that the wheels were a way to mark certain days of the year.Alice B. Kehoe and Thomas F. Kehoe, 1979, Solstice-Aligned Boulder Configurations in Saskatchewan. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper No. 48, Mercury Series, National Museum of Man, Ottawa. (Translated into French by P. Ferryn, published 1978 Kadath 26:19-31, Brussels, Belgium) In a paper for the Journal for the History of Astronomy Professor Bradley Schaefer stated that the claimed alignments for three wheels studied, the Bighorn medicine wheel, one at Moose Mountain in southeastern Saskatchewan, and one at Fort Smith, Montana, there was no statistical evidence for stellar alignments.  Medicine Wheel Park, Valley City, North Dakota, US  Joe Stickler of Valley City State University, North Dakota, with the assistance of his students, began the construction of Medicine Wheel Park in 1992. The Park showcases two solar calendars: \\"a horizon calendar (the medicine wheel) and a meridian or noontime calendar.\\" According to the Medicine Wheel website, the \\"large circle measures 213 feet around. The 28 spokes radiating from its center represent the number of days in the lunar cycle. Six spokes extending well beyond the Wheel are aligned to the horizon positions of sunrises and sunsets on the first days of the four seasons.\\"  New Age views  New Age writers tend to center the idea of the medicine wheel as an individualistic tool of personal development. This redefinition is in stark contrast to the indigenous view of ceremony and sacred sites being rooted in the community rather than the individual.Aldred, Lisa, \\"Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality\\" in: The American Indian Quarterly issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352.

New Place () was William Shakespeare's final place of residence in Stratford-upon-Avon. He died there in 1616. Though the house no longer exists, the site is owned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which maintains it as a specially-designed garden for tourists. Early history The house stood on the corner of Chapel Street and Chapel Lane, and was apparently the second largest dwelling in the town. It was built in 1483 by Sir Hugh Clopton, a wealthy London mercer and Lord Mayor. Built of timber and brick (then an innovation in Stratford) it had ten fireplaces, five handsome gables, and grounds large enough to incorporate two barns and an orchard. In 1496 Sir Hugh Clopton left New Place in his will to his great-nephew William Clopton I ('my cousin William Clopton') and the male heirs of the lordship of Clopton. In his will William Clopton I (d. 29 May 1521) granted his wife, Rose (d. 17 August 1525)Rose later married Sir Giles Greville; . a life interest in the property, with the reversion after her death to his son, William Clopton II. In November 1543 the latter leased it for forty years to a surgeon, Thomas Bentley (d.1549), who left his wife, Anne, a life interest in the lease during her widowhood. Anne remarried, however, and after she became the wife of Richard Charnock, William Clopton II retook possession of New Place. By his wife Elizabeth Grey, the daughter of Sir Edward Grey of Enville, Staffordshire, William Clopton II had a son, William Clopton III (1537–1592), to whom he left New Place by will in 1560. On 20 December 1563, hard-pressed for money to pay his sisters' marriage portions and continue travelling in Italy, William Clopton III sold New Place to William Bott, who had already resided in it for several years. In 1567 Bott sold New Place to William Underhill I (c. 1523 – 31 March 1570), an Inner Temple lawyer and clerk of assizes at Warwick, and a substantial property holder in Warwickshire. Sale to Shakespeare The final concord (a conveyance in two parts) between William Shakespeare and Hercules Underhill, confirming Shakespeare's title to New Place, Michaelmas 1602 At his death in 1570, Underhill left New Place to his son, William Underhill II (d.1597), who in 1597 sold it to William Shakespeare for £60. He (William Underhill II) died two months later, and it emerged that he had been poisoned by his eldest son and heir, Fulke Underhill. According to some sources, Fulke Underhill died in May 1598 while still a minor and before the fact that he had murdered his father was discovered. According to other sources, however, Fulke Underhill was hanged in 1599 for his father's murder and attainted for felony, whereby his property, including New Place, was forfeit to the crown. In 1602 the Court of Exchequer appointed a commission to \\"obtain an account of the possessions of Fulke Underhill of Fillongley, county Warwick, felon, who had taken the life of his father, William Underhill, by poison\\". When Fulke's younger brother, Hercules Underhill, came of age in 1602, his father's former properties were regranted to him, and he and Shakespeare negotiated a confirmation of the sale.'Final Concord Between William Shakespeare and Hercules Underhill', World Digital Library Retrieved 20 December 2013. After Shakespeare's death In 1616 the house passed to his daughter Susanna Hall, and then his granddaughter, Elizabeth Hall, who had recently remarried after the death of her first husband, Thomas Nash, who had owned the house next door. After Elizabeth died, the house was returned to the Clopton family. In 1702 John Clopton radically altered, or rebuilt, the original New Place – contemporary illustrations suggest the latter. In 1756 then-owner Reverend Francis Gastrell, having become tired of visitors, attacked and destroyed a mulberry tree in the garden said to have been planted by Shakespeare. In retaliation, the townsfolk destroyed New Place's windows. Gastrell applied for local permission to extend the garden. His application was rejected and his tax was increased, so Gastrell retaliated by demolishing the house in 1759. This greatly outraged the inhabitants and Gastrell was eventually forced to leave town. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust acquired New Place and Nash's House in 1876. Today the site of New Place is accessible through a museum that resides in Nash's House, the house next door.British Archaeology The Voice of Archaeology in Britain and Beyond. Issue 113 July/August 2010 The site received 109,452 visitors during 2018. Archaeological excavations Excavations in the grounds of Nash's House were carried out during 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Birmingham Archaeology. Archaeologists from Time Team visited the dig during 2011 and a special programme on the subject, \\"Searching for Shakespeare's House\\", was transmitted on 11 March 2012. BBC One National Treasures broadcast a live programme from the site in August 2011. Findings from the excavation indicated the presence of a Tudor structure but were inconclusive as to the ground plan of Shakespeare's original house. =Clay pipe fragments at Stratford-upon-Avon= Clay pipe fragments unearthed in recent years in Shakespeare's Stratford-upon- Avon garden were found to possibly contain traces of cannabis, along with tobacco and camphor, based on the results of a study published in the South African Journal of Science. This has fuelled speculation by some that Shakespeare may have possibly smoked cannabis, which is known to have been used to treat certain medical conditions at the time by Elizabethans, as well as in the manufacture of materials such as sails, rope, and clothing, and may have also been used for purposes of pleasure. The pipe fragments, however, could have belonged to any number of other persons besides the famous playwright, and cannot be definitively dated to the periods of his residency there.

He is pictured as an anthropomorphic blue parrot with a yellow beak wearing a black beret and a pair of red and black checkered trousers. He was created by the Swiss cartoonist Robert Lips, as an advertising character for the Swiss department store Globus in 1932 for the company's 25th anniversary. He was originally planned to be called \\"Kimbukku\\", but later renamed Globi after the local Basel German (Baseldytsch) dialect word for the department store that created him. History He initially appeared in a cartoon strip called \\"Der Globi\\", and later appeared in a cartoon picture-book form called \\"Globi's World Voyage\\" in 1935. By 1944, the character gained so much popularity that Globus created a separate company for it, and in 1948 Globi had sold over one million picture books. He was introduced in other markets such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil, but did not do as well. In the 1970s, he was accused of being sexist, racist, and promoting violence, which was based on the attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s, but the articles in question were then withdrawn and revised. Present He is one of the most popular characters in the German-Speaking part of Switzerland, with sales of over 9 million books. However, he stays mostly unknown in the French and Italian speaking parts of the country. In October 2003, a full-length film, \\"Globi and the Stolen Shadows\\" was made which was based on him. It was directed by Robi Engler in Anime-style. Beside the books, there is a lot of Globi merchandise, including cuddly toys, crockery, cutlery, clocks, school equipment, card games, food. From December 2008, the Swiss town of Engelberg hosts a Globi theme park.

She served on the West Coast of Africa, West Indies, and the Halifax station. During the French Revolutionary Wars she participated in the Battle of the Nile before a French ship captured her. The Russians and Turks recaptured her and returned her to the Royal Navy in 1799. On 23 February 1805, while on the Halifax station, Leander captured the French frigate Ville de Milan and recaptured her prize, . On 25 April 1805 cannon fire from Leander killed an American seaman while Leander was trying to search an American vessel off the US coast for contraband. The resulting \\"Leander Affair\\" contributed to the worsening of relations between the United States and Great Britain. In 1813 the Admiralty converted Leander to a hospital ship under the name Hygeia. Hygeia was sold in 1817. Early service She was commissioned in June 1780 under Captain Thomas Shirley.She was the first Royal Navy vessel to be named for the Leander of the Greek myth of Hero and Leander. Leander cruised for some time in the North Sea. At the end of 1781 Leander and the sloop-of-war sailed for the Dutch Gold Coast with a convoy, consisting of a few merchant-vessels and transports. Britain was at war with the Dutch Republic and Shirley launched an unsuccessful attack on 17 February on the Dutch outpost at Elmina, being repulsed four days later. Leander and Shirley then went on to capture the small Dutch forts at Moree (Fort Nassau - 20 guns), Kormantine (Courmantyne or Fort Amsterdam - 32 guns; 6 March), Apam (Fort Lijdzaamheid or Fort Patience - 22 guns; 16 March), Senya Beraku (Berricoe, Berku, Fort Barracco or Fort Goede Hoop - 18 guns; 23 March), and Accra (Fort Crèvecœur or Ussher Fort - 32 guns; 30 March).Crooks (1973), pp.51 and 62. Leander also destroyed the French store-ship , off Senegal, supposed to be worth £30,000. Shirley garrisoned those facilities with personnel from Cape Coast.Creek, p. 62 Shirley sent two sets of dispatches back to Britain. One set went in the transport sloop Ulysses, which was under the command of Captain Frodsham. The French frigate Fée captured Ulysses and took her into Brest, but not before her captain had weighted the dispatches and thrown them overboard. Shirley's first lieutenant, Mr. Van court, took the second set in the cartel transport Mackerel, which also carried the Dutch governors of the forts to Europe. Shirley then sailed to the West Indies where towards the end of 1782 as senior captain he became commanding officer prior to the arrival of Admiral Hugh Pigot. Pigot promoted him to captain of the 90-gun . Pigot appointed Captain John Willet Payne to replace Shirley. On 18 January 1783, Leander was escorting a cartel when the two vessels encountered a large French warship at midnight. After an inconclusive engagement of two hours, Leander and her opponent separated. Pigot reported that the French vessel was probably a 74-gun ship of the line. Furthermore, rumour had it that she was the Couronne and that she had gone on to Puerto Rico. On 4 March Leander captured the brig Bella Juditta. Leander was one of the five warships and the armed storeship Sally that shared in the proceeds of the capture on 23 March of the ship Arend op Zee. Captain J. Reynolds took command briefly in 1784 before Leander was paid-off in Portsmouth in April. She was recommissioned in August 1786, after repairs in 1785. Captain Sir James Barclay commissioned Leander in August 1786 and then sailed her for Nova Scotia on 9 April 1787. She served as flagship for Sir Herbert Sawyer in 1788 until paid off in September. Captain Joseph Peyton, Jr. immediately recommissioned her as the flagship for his father Rear-Admiral Joseph Peyton, Sr. She sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 December. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars Leander was recommissioned in May 1795 under Captain Maurice Delgano. On 12 May 1796 she was part of Admiral Duncan's squadron, when , of the squadron, captured the Dutch frigate Argo and the brig Mercury. The Royal Navy took both Argo and Mercury into service: Argo became and Mercury became . Leander shared by agreement in the proceeds of the capture of the Vrow Hendrica, captured on 22 October. In November 1796 Leander came under the command of Captain Thomas Boulden Thompson. She then escorted a convoy to Gibraltar on 7 January 1797. Leander joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent, and was assigned to the squadron under Horatio Nelson. Thompson took part in Nelson's attack on Santa Cruz in July 1797. Thompson was among the leaders of the landing parties, under the overall direction of Nelson and Thomas Troubridge. Wind hampered the initial attempts to force a landing; the Spanish defenders immediately subjected the successful landing in the evening of 22 July to heavy fire. Still, Thompson's party were able to advance and spike several of the enemy's cannon. However, the British forces had become dispersed throughout the town, and were forced to negotiate a truce to allow them to withdraw. Thompson himself was wounded in the battle. Leander lost seven men killed, 6 wounded (including Thompson), and one missing. =Nile= Under Captain Thomas Thompson Leander took part in the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. She was able to exploit a gap in the French line and anchor between Peuple Souverain and , from which position she raked both enemy ships while protected from their broadsides. In the battle she suffered only 14 men wounded. =Capture= Carrying Nelson's dispatches from the Nile and accompanied by Sir Edward Berry, Leander encountered the 74-gun French third rate off Crete on 18 August 1798. In the subsequent action, Leander lost 35 men killed and 57 wounded, including Thompson. The French suffered 100 killed and 180 wounded, but captured Leander. The French took her into service under her existing name. The French treated the prisoners badly and plundered almost everything but the clothes the British had on their backs. When Thompson remonstrated with Captain Lejoille of Généreux, Lejoille answered nonchalantly, \\"J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage.\\" (\\"It makes me angry, but the fact is, the French are good at pillaging.\\")James (1837), Vol.2, pp.234-236. They refused treatment for Thompson, who had been badly wounded. Leanders surgeon, Mr. Mulberry, was able to remove a musket ball from Thompson's arm only after the vessels reached Corfu on 1 September and he was smuggled aboard the vessel where the French were holding Thompson. Most of the officers returned to Britain on parole but the French detained a number of seamen, and in particular Thomas Jarrat, the carpenter, after he refused to reveal to them the dimensions of Leanders masts and spars. Captain Lejoille tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to get some of the British crew that he had detained to assist him when a Turko-Russian fleet appeared off Corfu. The British refused. The subsequent court-martial aboard at Sheerness most honourably acquitted Thompson, his officers, and his crew. The court also thanked Berry for the assistance he gave during the battle. As Thompson was rowed back to shore, the crews of all the ships at Sheerness saluted him with three cheers.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.87. He was subsequently knighted and awarded a pension of £200 per annum.(Obituary) Leander was at Corfu when a joint Russian and Ottoman force besieged the island. On 28 February 1799, the Russians and Ottomans attacked Vido, a small island (less than a kilometer across) at the mouth of the port of Corfu. A four-hour bombardment by several ships suppressed all five shore batteries on the island. Leander and the corvette Brune tried to intervene but were damaged and forced to retreat to the protection of the batteries of Corfu. The Russians and Turks recaptured Leander and Brune when Corfu capitulated to them on 3 March 1799. The Russians restored Leander to the Royal Navy.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.377. They also gave Brune to the Ottomans. =Return to British service= Leander was recommissioned in the Mediterranean under Commander Adam Drummond in June 1799. In September Captain Michael Halliday took command. From July 1801 to June 1802 she refitted at Deptford. She recommissioned in May under Captain James Oughton as flagship for Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell. In July she sailed for Halifax. Captain Francis Fane took command a year later, in August 1803, with Captain Alexander Skene replacing him in November. On 16 August 1804 Leander was in company with when they recaptured Hibberts. She then had three more captains within the year: George Ralph Collier, Oughton again, and from November, John Talbot. On 23 February 1805, while on the Halifax station, Leander discovered the French frigate Ville de Milan, under Captain Pierre Guillet, and the British , which Ville de Milan had captured the day before. The engagement between Ville de Milan and Cleopatra had left both ships greatly damaged. Consequently, when they encountered Leander they struck to Leander without a fight. Leander came upon Cleopatra first, and as soon as she struck, the British prisoners on board her, i.e., her original crew, took possession of her. She then followed Leander towards Ville de Paris, which too struck. The Navy took Ville de Milan into service as . On 3 June Leander captured Nancy. Three days later she captured Elizabeth. The next day Leander captured Volunteer. On 12 October, Leander captured Vengeance. Thereafter, in recognition of the capture of Ville de Milan and the recapture of Cleopatra, the Admiralty promoted Talbot to command of ship of the line .Talbot, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 25 May 2008 The Leander Affair An engraving depicting the incident. HMS Leander then came under the command of Captains William Lyall and Henry Whitby. Leander, under Slingsby Simpson, and , under John Nairne, were repeatedly stationed off Sandy Hook, ostensibly to keep watch on two French frigates that had taken refuge in the harbour. However, in the summer of 1804, the warships began stopping and boarding all American ships going into New York just outside the United States's three-mile territorial limit, and searching them for any French goods. If anything suspicious was found, the ship was detained and taken to Halifax. On 25 April 1806, Leander fired a warning shot over the bow of a merchantman, signalling it to stop. The cannonball passed into the harbour, decapitating John Pierce, the helmsman of the Richard, a small coasting sloop inside the harbour. The sloop's captain, who was Pierce's brother, made his way to New York City, where he gathered a mob that paraded Pierce's body and head through the streets. The next day, an angry mob intercepted a party from Leander returning to their ship with a load of provisions; the mob seized the provisions and placed them on twenty carts, the lead one bearing a pole flying an American flag and a British one below it. The carts were wheeled around the city as members of the mob beat drums. When the crowd reached Alms House, the provisions were given to the poor, and the British flag was burned. Protest meetings were held over the incident. John Pierce was given a large public funeral. Four of Leanders officers caught ashore were imprisoned for their own protection, and were later secretly released. New York Times synopsis of the book The seventh Regiment.Budiansky, Stephen: Perilous Fight: America's intrepid war with Britain on the high seas, 1812-1815 On 14 June President Thomas Jefferson issued a proclamation against Captain Whitby. He ordered Leander, Driver and Cambrian immediately to quit US waters and forbade them ever to return. He extended the same prohibition to all vessels that Captains Whitby, John Nairne and Simpson might command.Draft of Proclamation concerning \\"Leander\\" - Thomas Jefferson, The Works of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 10 (Correspondence and Papers 1803-1807) [1905], Ed.

On 26 April Leander, Cambrian and Driver captured the American ship Aurora. In May Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys took command of Leander at Halifax as she became the flagship for Admiral George Berkeley.Captain Richard Raggett then sailed her back to Britain in 1807. Fate By 1807 Leander was out of commission at Portsmouth. In 1808 she was in Plymouth. In October 1810, Leander was fitted as a medical depot ship at Portsmouth. In 1813 the Admiralty commissioned a new so the old Leander was given the name Hygeia. Hygeia was sold on 14 April 1817 to a Mr. Thomas for £2,100.

Leander and her near sister were a new type of ship in the Royal Navy, being exceptionally large and powerful frigates. They were ordered in response to the threat posed by the heavy American spar-decked frigates, during the War of 1812. Leander proved a successful ship, which operated in squadrons which chased the American frigates, but ultimately failed to catch them before the war ended. Refitted to serve as flagships for admirals on foreign stations, Leander saw action with Admiral Edward Pellew's fleet at the bombardment of Algiers in 1816, firing over 3,000 round shot and sustaining severe casualties. She spent some time as the flagship on the North American Station, followed by in the East Indies, before returning to Britain in 1822 and being laid up the following year as a receiving ship. She spent the rest of her career in this role, until being broken up in 1830. Construction and commissioning HMS Leander was ordered from the Blackwall- based firm of Wigram, Wells & Green on 6 May 1813. She was laid down in June 1813 and built of pitch pine to a design by Sir William Rule. Built of softwood to get her into service as quickly as possible, Leander was launched on 10 November 1813, less than five months after laying down. She was moved to Woolwich Dockyard and completed there by 18 February 1814. The construction of fourth rates, a type that had fallen out of favour prior to the French Revolutionary Wars, was a response to the American spar-decked frigates, like . A spar-decked frigate was one with a continuous row of cannon on the uppermost deck, conventional frigates had an open waist amidships where no guns were mounted. Ordered alongside Leander was the similar 50-gun . Leander was a spar-deck frigate, designed to carry thirty 24-pounder guns on her main deck, and twenty-six 42-pounder carronades on her spar deck, with four 24-pounders on her forecastle. This nominal armament was slightly altered during her 1813–18 commission, when two extra 24-pounders replaced two of the carronades on the spar deck. She was reported to be fast, exceeding 13 knots, but had a reputation for heavy and violent movements, probably due to poor stowage; this was fixed in her 1820 commission. In 1815, after the War of 1812 and Napoleonic Wars, Newcastle and Leander were fitted with accommodation for a flag officer with a poop deck built over the quarterdeck, and were mostly used as flagships on foreign stations, replacing older 50-gun ships that had previously filled this role. Both ships were re-rated as 60-gun fourth rates in February 1817. George Collier, Leanders first commander, by William Beechey. A star frigate captain with distinguished service off the Spanish coast to his credit, Collier's failure to catch a fleeing American frigate during his time in command of Leander was ultimately his downfall. Leander was commissioned under her first commander, Captain George Collier, in December 1813. Collier had commissioned Newcastle the previous month, but then moved to Leander. Service off America Leander went out to North America under Collier's command, and formed part of a powerful squadron assigned to deal with the American super-frigates. Collier had previously served with distinction off the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, and the highly sought-after posting reflected the Admiralty's approval of these efforts. He captured the on 22 June 1814. Collier sought battle with the , but the American ship escaped from Boston and evaded him. He gathered a squadron consisting of the Leander, Newcastle and the 40-gun , and set off in pursuit. He almost caught up with the Constitution off St Jago, but failed to close on her, later claiming the weather frustrated his attempts. The Constitution was at the time sailing with two captured British prizes, the former and . Collier's three ships gave chase and were overhauling the Constitution, when, having allowed the Cyane to escape, the Levant broke away and Collier followed her. In doing so he retook the Levant,Copy of a Letter sent to Sir Alexander Cochrane, signed on-board HMS Leander but allowed Constitution to escape. Collier continued to cruise in the area, but before he had another opportunity to pursue the Constitution, news reached him that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed and that the war was over. Leander recaptured the British merchant vessel John on 4 January 1815, just before the end of the war. Later service The bombardment of Algiers, on the far left is HMS Leander, stationed ahead of the flagship , painting by Thomas Luny Leanders next commander, from August 1815, was Captain William Skipsey. She underwent a repair and refit at Woolwich between August 1815 and February 1816, after which she went out to the Mediterranean under Captain Edward Chetham. She was active in the Second Barbary War, as part of the British fleet under Admiral Edward Pellew. She took part in the bombardment of Algiers on 27 August 1816, firing 3,680 round shot and sustaining casualties of 17 men killed and 118 wounded. Leander then became the flagship of the commander of the North American Station, Rear-Admiral Sir David Milne in 1817, and was based at Halifax.She was repaired at Portsmouth between July and November 1819, and recommissioned that year under Captain Charles Richardson. Richardson took her out to the East Indies as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood.

SS-340, originally named Chickwick, was renamed Entemedor on 24 September 1942 and launched on 17 December 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. E. V. Izac; and commissioned on 6 April 1945, Lieutenant Commander W. R. Smith, Jr. in command. Service history =United States Navy= World War II Entemedor reached Pearl Harbor on 29 June 1945 from New London, en route to Midway Atoll for advanced training and to prepare for war patrols. She put to sea on her first war patrol on 24 July, and served as lifeguard for air strikes on Marcus Island before sailing on to patrol off Japan. When hostilities ceased, she was ordered to Saipan, where she arrived 17 August. Post-War The submarine returned to Seattle on 22 September 1945, and began a program of training operations along the west coast from San Diego. In 1946-1947, she made extended cruises in the Far East, basing at Subic Bay. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 10 December 1948. Recommissioned on 24 October 1950, Entemedor trained off the coast of California, and on 2 January 1951 sailed for New London and through the remainder of the year operated in the Atlantic. On 31 January 1952, she entered the Electric Boat Co.'s yard for an extensive GUPPY IIA modernization, was placed in commission in reserve on 28 February 1952, and returned to active status 17 October 1952. Every second year beginning in 1953, Entemedor deployed to the Mediterranean to serve with the 6th Fleet, and from her home port at New London also sailed for a midshipman cruise to northern European ports in the summer of 1958, and the Isle of Portland, England, in February 1960. Her stateside operations included participation in large-scale exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean, and serving as target for Task Force \\"Alfa\\", in development of antisubmarine warfare techniques. Through 1962 she continued to operate from New London. =Turkish Navy= Entemedor was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1972. She was transferred (sold) to Turkey - under the terms of the Security Assistance Act- on 24 August 1972, renamed TCG Preveze (S 345), the second submarine of that name. She was decommissioned and struck from the Turkish Naval rolls in 1987. See also See TCG Preveze for other ships of the same name.

In the late '80s Joe produced, engineered or mixed (for other labels) Schoolly, the 7A3, Steady B, Blackmale, Roxanne Shante and many others, establishing his rap rep. After foundering under an onerous distribution deal with Enigma Records in 1987 and 1988, Ruffhouse came to fruition when distribution was switched to Columbia. The label's first release was Cheba's The Piper in 1990, and their first hit was Tim Dog's Fuck Compton (with Joe mixing) which topped the rap charts in 1991 and fueled the East/West rap wars. The label came into its own with the release of the first Cypress Hill album, a double-platinum slice of THC-soaked L.A. Latino rap, exec-produced and mixed by Joe.

There are a number of popular shopping destinations located on Westbourne Grove and adjoining streets, pre- eminently: Portobello Market, Queensway and Ledbury Road. On 9 August 1997, authoritative weekly newsagent-magazine Time Out featured West London, selecting Westbourne Grove as the half-city's representative: \\"Seeking a key shopping road symbolic of western aspirations, we decided that preposterously fashionable Westbourne Grove, or 'Westbourne Village', has it all.

Around 2007, the road's eastern Bayswater-end, underwent a rapid period of transformation, east of Chepstow Road. Upon lease expiry, rents increased significantly and pricing-out many incumbent family businesses, which were replaced by fashionable / prestige restaurants and shops. History Westbourne Grove Church (2009) The development of Westbourne Grove began in the 1840s and proceeded from the east (which lay in Bayswater) to the west, where it became the principal east–west artery into the Ladbroke Estate. The far western end of the street only became known as Westbourne Grove relatively recently in 1938, having previously been called Archer Street. In 1929, the novelist A.J. Cronin opened his own medical practice at 152 Westbourne Grove. Westbourne Grove takes its name from Westbourne Green - a settlement that developed to the west of the bourne that later took the name River Westbourne.Paddington - Westbourne Green  British History Online This river currently runs underground at Ossington Street. The area is first recorded in 1222 as Westeburn. Westbourne Green is first recorded as Westborne Grene in 1548. Westbourne Green formed part of the parish of Paddington. There was a small settlement to the north of what is now Westbourne Grove at Westbourne Green. It had five main houses. The largest of these was Westbourne Place or Westbourne House, which was rebuilt in 1745 by the architect Isaac Ware as an elegant Georgian mansion of three storeys with a frontage of nine windows divided into three parts. The central third was topped by a large pediment and contained the main door, which also had a pediment over it. The lower two storeys were formed into bays at each end, which contained three windows each. Amongst the well-known residents of this house were Sir William Yorke, baronet; the Venetian ambassador; the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (a great great nephew of the diarist Samuel Pepys); and the General Commander in Chief of the Army, Viscount Hill, who left in 1836 (and who gave his name to the modern road bridge north of Westbourne Grove called Lord Hill's Bridge). The house was demolished in 1836 to make way for the houses and gardens of what is now Westbourne Park Villas. Thomas Hardy lived in this area, mainly at no 16 Westbourne Park Villas, which was his home 1863–67. Also north of what is now Westbourne Grove was Westbourne Farm which was the home, between 1815 - 1817, of the actress Sarah Siddons, who lived there with her daughter. The Farm was at the point where the Harrow Road, the Westway and the canal converge. Mrs Siddons was buried at St Mary's Church, the main church of Paddington, on Paddington Green, where her grave can still be seen. Though now popular and expensive for home-buyers, much of the area had become run-down in the 1950s, when it was the centre of the activities of notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman, after whom the phrase \\"Rachmanism\\" was coined. He was known for his violent evictions of tenants with legally fixed rents. He replaced them—in what had become overcrowded multi-occupied housing—mainly with recent migrants from the West Indies who, because of discrimination and council tenant restrictions, could not find accommodation. He operated from an office in Westbourne Grove.British History Online - Paddington & Westbourne Green Part of the area, including streets between Ledbury Rd & Shrewsbury Road to the south of Westbourne Park Road, became derelict and was consequently compulsorily purchased and demolished.Flickr photo-set illustrating aftermath of Rachmanism in Westbourne Park area of London Notting Hill Post Office, in Westbourne Grove, finally closed in a storm of controversy during early 2005.

This extreme arched pose is an extrapyramidal effect and is caused by spasm of the axial muscles along the spinal column. It has been shown to occur naturally in birds, snakes suffering from advanced boid inclusion body disease, and placental mammals, among existing animals; it is observed in some articulated dinosaur fossils. Causes Opisthotonus is a symptom of some cases of severe cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury or as a result of the severe muscular spasms associated with tetanus. It can be a feature of severe acute hydrocephalus, poisoning, and drowning. =Infants= Opisthotonus is more pronounced in infants. Opisthotonus in the neonate may be a symptom of meningitis, tetanus, severe kernicterus, or the rare maple syrup urine disease. This marked extensor tone can cause infants to \\"rear backwards\\" and stiffen out as the mother or nurse attempts to hold or feed them. Individuals with opisthotonus are quite challenging to position, especially in wheelchairs and car seats. Opisthotonus can be triggered by any attempt at movement, such as smiling, feeding, speech, or by involuntary movement, such as seizures. A similar tonic posturing may be seen in Sandifer syndrome. =Poisoning= Opisthotonus can sometimes be seen in lithium intoxication. It is a rare extrapyramidal side effect of phenothiazines, haloperidol, and metoclopramide. Opisthotonus with the presence of the risus sardonicus is also a symptom of strychnine poisoning and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) poisoning. =Drowning and the \\"dinosaur death pose\\"= Opisthotonus is seen with drowning victims – called the \\"opisthotonic death pose\\". This pose is also common in complete dinosaur skeletal fossils and it has been suggested that this is due to the animal drowning or being immersed in water soon after death. =Vivisection= Opisthotonus can be produced experimentally in animals by transection of the midbrain (between the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus), which results in severing all the corticoreticular fibers. Severe \\"arching\\" (hyperextension) occurs due to stimulus by the anterior reticulospinal tract caused by the loss of the balancing inhibitory counter-stimulus of corticoreticular fibers, which normally act upon the pons reticular formation. =Other causes= Opisthotonus is also described as a potential CNS symptom of heat stroke along with bizarre behavior, hallucinations, decerebrate rigidity, oculogyric crisis, and cerebellar dysfunction. Opisthotonus is a symptom of \\"lavender foal syndrome\\", a lethal genetic disorder in horses. Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, introduced thiamine-deprived pigeons as a model for understanding how thiamine deficiency can lead to the pathological- physiological symptoms of beriberi. Indeed, feeding the pigeons upon polished rice leads to an easily recognizable behavior of head retraction, a condition called opisthotonos. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine at the stage of opisthotonos led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were observed in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical lesion.

Antonov designed a number of known Soviet aeroplanes (such as the Antonov An-2, Antonov An-12) and numerous gliders for both civilian and military use. Early life Antonov was born on 7 February 1906 in Troitsy, Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire (now Podolsky District of the Moscow Oblast), Russian Empire of Russian Ethnicity.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=10127 In 1912, the Antonovs moved to Saratov, where he attended the non-classical secondary school (now gymnasium №1) and secondary school (now school №23). From an early age, Antonov was fascinated with aviation and spent much of his spare time at the local airfield. Early engineering career At the age of 17, Antonov founded the \\"Amateur Aviation Club\\" and later joined the \\"Organization of Friends of the Air Force\\". Later he designed the OKA-1 \\"Pigeon\\", a glider that was entered in a competition in Moscow where he won the first prize, a flight on a Junkers 12 aircraft. In 1930, Antonov graduated from the Kalinin Polytechnical Institute in Leningrad. He continued to design gliders and in 1931 Antonov became the chief designer at the Moscow Glider Factory. During the next eight years, he designed 30 different gliders including the Standard-1, Standard-2, OKA-6 and the large \\"City of Lenin\\" glider. Due to a requirement that all pilots in the Soviet Union had to begin their flight training in gliders, Antonov was able to produce up to 8,000 gliders per year. In 1938, after an incident when an instructor defected to the West using a glider, the Soviet government reversed its decision regarding glider training, banned the sport of gliding and shut down the Moscow Glider Factory. Professional designer career and World War II Following the closure of the glider factory, Antonov was appointed chief designer for the Yakovlev Design Bureau. In 1940 a new aircraft design bureau under his own management was established in Leningrad. During World War II, Antonov designed the A-7 military glider used for airbridge supply of the Soviet partisans behind the front lines, and the KT \\"Kryl'ja Tanka\\" (\\"Tank Wings\\") biplane glider that was designed to airlift tanks. In 1943, Antonov returned to Yakovlev’s design bureau to fill a vacancy as Yakovlev’s deputy. Much of his time and energy was devoted to the improvement of the Yak series, one of the most mass-produced fighter aircraft types of World War II.\\"Biography of Oleg K.

An-124-100 Ruslan civil certificated version of strategic airlifter. After the war, Antonov requested that Yakovlev let him work independently, heading Yakovlev’s subsidiary design office at the aircraft manufacturing factory at Novosibirsk. On 31 May 1946, Antonov was appointed head of the newly redesignated facility (subsequently known as the Antonov Research and Design Bureau), which was later moved to Kiev, Ukraine. In September 1946, Antonov, in addition to his management of the design bureau, became the director of the Siberian R&D; Institute for Aeronautics. The first of the Antonov Bureau's designs was the SKh-1 (Se'lsko Khozyaystvennyi- pervoy - agricultural-first one) agricultural aircraft, later redesignated An-2, designed to meet a 1947 Soviet requirement for a replacement for the Polikarpov Po-2 which was used in large numbers as both an agricultural aircraft and a utility aircraft. Antonov designed a large single- bay biplane of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit and a cabin accommodating 12 passengers. A series of significant transports followed under Oleg Antonov's direction. Antonov aircraft (design office prefix An-) range from a rugged An-2 (which itself is comparatively large for a biplane) through the An-28 reconnaissance aircraft to the massive An-124 Ruslan strategic airlifter. The quad-turboprop An-12 and its derivatives became the primary Soviet military transport from 1959 onward. While less well known, the An-24, An-26, An-30 and An-32 family of twin-turboprop, high winged, passenger/cargo/troops aircraft predominate in domestic/short-haul air services in the former Soviet Union and parts of the world formerly under Soviet influence. Antonov also oversaw development of the mid-range (An-72/An-74 jet airplanes family. The world's largest production aircraft, the An-124 Ruslan, flew for the first time in 1982, and its specialised shuttle-carrying/extra-heavy cargo derivative, the An-225 Mriya entered development, still under Antonov's guidance, but did not make its maiden flight until 1989 after the death of Antonov. In November 2004, FAI placed the An-225 in the Guinness Book of Records for its 240 records. Some of Antonov's designs are also built abroad, such as the Shaanxi Y-8.

His appointment to the position was formally announced on April 26, 2006. His selection was initially criticized because of some of his past comments about Bush. Bush acknowledged Snow's criticisms during the announcement of Snow's appointment, saying that Snow was \\"not afraid to express his own opinions\\". Snow began his new press secretary duties on May 8, 2006. He decided to leave the position of press secretary after new White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten asked all staff members to either commit to staying through the end of Bush's second term, in January 2009, or to leave by Labor Day of 2007.

Reed became active in the Republican Party and in 1861 he began his political career, moving to Washington, DC for a patronage job in the Treasury Department. In 1863 he was appointed as the Tax Commissioner of Florida, to oversee confiscation and sales of Confederate properties in Union-occupied areas. In 1865 he was appointed as Postal Agent for the state. In 1868 he was elected as Governor under the new constitution, which enfranchised freedmen. He served one term, with challenges by factions of the Republican Party resulting in two attempts in the state senate at impeachment. He strongly supported public education, where the growth in new schools served one-quarter of the children by 1872. Early life and education Harrison was one of eight Reed children, born on August 26, 1813, in Littleton, Massachusetts, to parents Seth Reed (1781-1848) and Rhoda (Finney) Reed (1781-1874). The Reed family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1836, where his siblings contributed to the newly developing areas and two brothers became politicians. His brothers were Herbert Reed, who became a grocer in Milwaukee and married Phebe Adeline Brisbane; Orson Reed of Summit, Wisconsin, who married Agnes Fairservice; Curtis Reed, who served as a state legislator; and George B. Reed, who became a judge and politician in Wisconsin. His sisters married substantial men: Mary Augusta Reed (1811-1866) married Judge Abram Daniel Smith (1811-1865); Martha (1817-1902) married Alexander Mitchell (1817-1887),, who became a banker and railroad tycoon; and Julia Ann married Dr. Thomas J. Noyes, who became the first president of the Milwaukee Academy of Medicine. At age 16, Harrison had been apprenticed to a printer, but health problems caused him to quit. When his family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he became a merchant there, opening the first general store. He also started the first Sunday school. After his business failed in the Panic of 1837, he took a turn at farming. He also became an early owner and editor of the Milwaukee Sentinel in the city, publishing it from December 1837 until May 1842. He co-published the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison with David Atwood from 1859-1861. On August 12, 1841, he married Amanda Anna Louisa Turner in Milwaukee. Together, they helped settle the towns of Neenah and Menasha. They had four children, one of whom died before the age of two. Politics and moves After joining the Republican Party in 1861, Reed moved to Washington, D.C., for a job that he had obtained at the Treasury Department. While they were living in Washington, his wife Amanda died on October 13, 1862. In 1863, Reed was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to be the Tax Commissioner in Florida to deal with sales and disposition of confiscated Confederate property. While working as Tax Commissioner, Reed traveled to Fernandina Beach on Amelia Island, which was occupied by Union forces, to oversee use of Confederate properties. There he met Chloe Merrick, who was teaching freedmen children, and was working to set up an orphanage. The widower was very impressed with Merrick, a young teacher from Syracuse, New York.Sarah Whitmer Foster and John T. Foster, Jr., \\"Chloe Merrick Reed: Freedom's First Lady\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly Vol. 71, No. 3 (Jan., 1993), pp. 279–299; via JSTOR In 1869, Reed encountered Chloe Merrick again, who had moved to North Carolina for her health and was again teaching freed children. He proposed marriage to her. They were married at the home of Merrick’s sister and brother-in-law in Syracuse, New York, on August 10, 1869. They had a son Harrison, Jr. together. In 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Reed as the Postal Agent for Florida. He continued to be involved with postwar development in the state. During the Reconstruction era, in 1868 Florida enacted a new constitution, which extended the franchise to freedmen. Most joined the Republican Party, which had emancipated them. Reed was elected governor under the new constitution. He assumed office on June 8, 1868. The results were disputed by the Democrats. It was not until July 4, 1868, that the federal commander of military forces in Florida for Reconstruction recognized the constitution and the election as valid. Florida was readmitted to the Union at that time. Reed appointed Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs as Florida's first African-American Secretary of State, and also commissioned Gibbs as a lieutenant colonel in the Florida State Militia. He had a tumultuous tenure, with opposition from factions of the Republican Party. They made two attempts to pass impeachment resolutions in the state senate against him. In the first effort, the state senate voted for his impeachment in November 1868, and William Henry Gleason, his lieutenant governor from 1868 to 1870, proclaimed himself as Governor. The state adjutant general and the county's sheriff supported Reed and organized an effort to deny Gleason access to the Capitol. On November 24, 1868, the Florida Supreme Court held that the Senate had lacked a quorum at their vote and could not have impeached Reed. Gleason was forced out. During the Senate's second attempt to impeach Reed, Lieutenant Governor Samuel T. Day claimed to be Acting Governor from February 10 to May 4, 1872, while the senate was conducting hearings and voting. While his impeachment was pending, Reed had felt he was disqualified from holding office, and left the capital. The Legislature adjourned without bringing him to trial, which he construed as equivalent to acquittal. While Day was in Jacksonville for a party caucus, Reed returned to Tallahassee, declared himself Governor, and appointed a new Attorney General. Reed's proclamation was approved by the Secretary of State and upheld by the State Supreme Court.Davis, William Watson.

Tallahassee. 2007. Softcover Hardcover Reed served as governor until January 7, 1873. He is believed to have been influenced by his wife's interest in education and alleviating poverty. After their marriage, he supported founding a state university, and gave strong support to public education. It was established for the first time in the state by the Reconstruction legislature. From 1870 to 1872, the number of public schools in the state increased from 270 to 444, and the number of children served grew from 7500 to 16,258, roughly one-quarter of the population of student age. After holding office, Reed acquired a farm south of Jacksonville, along the St. Johns River. He returned to journalism, editing a local magazine, The Semi-Tropical. Although he struggled financially, he and Chloe Merrick Reed were active in civic affairs. In 1889 Reed was appointed as US Postmaster of Tallahassee by President Benjamin Harrison, serving for the remainder of his administration. Reed's final public service was to represent Duval County in Florida’s House of Representatives until his death in Jacksonville on May 25, 1899. Honors Reed Street in Jacksonville, Florida, is named for him.

She was the lead ship of a class of eight ships, the Leander-class light cruiser and was initially named HMS Leander.  History  Leander was launched at Devonport on 24 September 1931. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Leander on 24 March 1933. Along with she served in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. In August 1937 HMS Leander, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and on each island a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: \\"This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI.\\" In 1941 the New Zealand Division became the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and she was commissioned as HMNZS Leander in September 1941. Italian ship Ramb I sinking after the engagement with Leander In World War II, Leander served initially in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Commander Stephen Roskill, in later years the Royal Navy's Official Historian, was posted as the ship's executive officer in 1941. In action on 27 February 1941, she sank the Italian armed merchantman near the Maldives, rescuing 113 of her crew and taking slight damage. On 23 March 1941, Leander intercepted and captured the Vichy French merchant Charles L.D. in the Indian Ocean between Mauritius and Madagascar. On 14 April, Leander deployed for support of military operations in Persian Gulf and, on 18 April, joined the aircraft carrier and the light cruiser . On 22 April, Leander was released from support duties in the Persian Gulf and took part in search for German raider south of the Maldives. In June 1941, Leander was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and was active against the Vichy French during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. After serving in the Mediterranean, Leander returned to the Pacific Ocean in September 1941. On 13 July 1943, Leander was with Rear Admiral Walden Lee Ainsworth's Task Group 36.1 of three light cruisers: Leander and the US ships and . The task group also included ten destroyers. At 01:00 the Allied ships established radar contact with the , which was accompanied by five destroyers near Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands. In the ensuing Battle of Kolombangara, Jintsu was sunk and all three Allied cruisers were hit by torpedoes and disabled. Leander was hit by a single torpedo just abaft 'A' boiler room. 26 crew from the boiler room and the No.1 4-inch gun mount immediately above were killed or posted missing. The ship was so badly damaged that she took no further part in the war. She was first repaired in Auckland, then proceeded to a full refit in Boston. She returned to the Royal Navy on 27 August 1945. In 1946 she was involved in the Corfu Channel Incident. She was scrapped in 1950. The superyacht Leander G, owned by Sir Donald Gosling, is named after HMS Leander, the first naval vessel on which he served. In 2020 Fiji will commission the RFNS Savenaca, a patrol vessell named after Savenaca Naulumatua, a sailor from Fiji who lost his life while serving on the Leander during the Battle of Kolombangara.

Description Illinois Eastern Community Colleges District #529 (IECC) is located in a area of southeastern Illinois near the Illinois-Indiana border. The multi-college District includes Frontier Community College at Fairfield, Lincoln Trail College at Robinson, Olney Central College at Olney, and Wabash Valley College at Mt. Carmel. Bordered on the east by the Wabash River, the District is located in a scenic section of the state, with wooded areas, golf courses, and recreational lakes scattered throughout the region. The District includes all or parts of 12 counties and has a total population of 111,000. Because the college District is one of 39 tax-supported community college districts in the State of Illinois, the cost is very affordable. In addition, the District has purposely held the line on costs to assure that all students have equal access to higher education. (IECC's tuition rate is one of the lowest in the tri-state area.) A diversified base of agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, processing, and distributing provides employment for citizens throughout southeast Illinois in such industries as Automotive Technology Systems, Marathon Petroleum Refining, Champion Laboratories, Hella Electronics, North American Lighting, Wal-Mart Distribution Center, and various healthcare centers. Each of the colleges is located in a small-town setting, with convenient access to larger cities in Illinois and Indiana. The colleges serve as centers for educational and cultural excellence, attracting not only recent high school graduates but also many adult students who are upgrading their skills, earning the first two years of a four-year degree, or participating in plays, concerts, and seminars. The college District also includes a highly successful Workforce Education program which provides short-term training for some 10,000 employees each year at plant sites throughout the State of Illinois and in other states and countries as well.

F. Skinner's attempt to develop a pigeon-controlled guided bomb. Overview The testbed was the same National Bureau of Standards-developed, unpowered airframe that was later used for the US Navy's radar-guided \\"Bat\\" glide bomb, which was basically a small glider, with wings and tail surfaces, an explosive warhead section in the center, and a \\"guidance section\\" in the nose cone. The intent was to train pigeons to act as \\"pilots\\" for the device, using their cognitive abilities to recognize the target. The guidance system consisted of three lenses mounted in the nose of the vehicle, which projected an image of the target on a screen mounted in a small compartment inside the nose cone. This screen was mounted on pivots and fitted with sensors that measured any angular movement. One to three pigeons, trained by operant conditioning to recognize the target, were stationed in front of the screen; when they saw the target, they would peck at the screen with their beaks. As long as the target remained in the center of the screen, the screen would not move, but if the bomb began to go off track, the image would move towards the edge of the screen. The pigeons would follow the image, pecking at it, which would move the screen on its pivots. The sensors would detect the movement and send signals to the control surfaces, which would steer the bomb in the direction the screen had moved. As the bomb swung back towards the target, the pigeons would again follow the image, bringing the screen back to the centered position again. In that way, the pigeons would correct any deviations in the course and keep the bomb on its glide path. Early electronic guidance systems use similar methods, only with electronic signals and processors replacing the birds in detecting the target and preventing deviation from the glide path. The National Defense Research Committee saw the idea to use pigeons in glide bombs as very eccentric and impractical, but still contributed $25,000 to the research. Skinner, who had some success with the training, complained: \\"our problem was no one would take us seriously\\". The program was canceled on October 8, 1944, because the military believed that \\"further prosecution of this project would seriously delay others which in the minds of the Division have more immediate promise of combat application\\". Project Pigeon was revived by the Navy in 1948 as \\"Project Orcon\\"; it was cancelled in 1953 when the reliability of electronic guidance systems was proven.

Although Reaction released only three albums, one EP and eighteen singles in its brief existence, its roster included two of the most popular British bands of the time, The Who and Cream. The label's first single, The Who's \\"Substitute\\", was released several times with different B-sides due to the band's legal dispute with their former record producer, Shel Talmy. This experience could be seen as one of the deciding factor in the Who's manager's Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp deciding to form their own Track Records label which was also distributed by Polydor Records. Polydor's involvement with these two labels (as well as Giorgio Gomelsky's Marmalade label) can be seen as a learning process by Polydor who were interested in expanding their base and had little or no experience in the 1960s pop/rock market; at the time, most of their business was done in the easy listening genre, as exemplified by Bert Kaempfert. Stigwood operated the RSO Records label in the 1970s and 1980s. As with Reaction, RSO was distributed through Polydor Records.

Photo: Mike Kay The Beat Hotel was a small, run-down hotel of 42 rooms at 9 Rue Gît-le-Cœur in the Latin Quarter of Paris, notable chiefly as a residence for members of the Beat poetry movement of the mid-20th century.First Chapter The Beat Hotel: Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Corso in Paris, 1957-1963, by Barry Miles. 2001. The New York Times Overview It was a \\"class 13\\" hotel, meaning bottom line, a place that was required by law to meet only minimum health and safety standards. It never had any proper name – \\"the Beat Hotel\\" was a nickname given it by Gregory Corso, which stuck.This Is the Beat Generation: New York-San Francisco-Paris, by James Campbell. Published by University of California Press, 2001. . Page 221.Nothing is True - Everything is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin, by John Geiger. Published by The Disinformation Company, 2005. . Page 121. The rooms had windows facing the interior stairwell and not much light. Hot water was available Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The hotel offered the opportunity for a bath – in the only bathtub, situated on the ground floor – provided the guest reserved time beforehand and paid the surcharge for hot water. Curtains and bedspreads were changed and washed every spring. The linen was (in principle) changed every month. The Beat Hotel was managed by a married couple, Monsieur and Madame Rachou, from 1933. After the death of Monsieur Rachou in a traffic accident in 1957, Madame was the sole manager until the early months of 1963, when the hotel was closed. Besides letting rooms, the establishment had a small bistro on the ground floor. Due to early experiences with working at an inn frequented by Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, Madame Rachou would encourage artists and writers to stay at the hotel and even at times permit them to pay the rent with paintings or manuscripts. One unusual thing that appealed to a clientele of bohemian artists was the permission to paint and decorate the rooms rented in whichever way they wanted. Fame with the Beat Generation The hotel gained fame through the extended 'family' of beat writers and artists who stayed there from the late 1950s to the early 1960s in a ferment of creativity. Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky first stayed there in 1957 and were soon joined by William S. Burroughs, Derek Raymond, Harold Norse and Gregory Corso, as well as Sinclair Beiles. It was here that Burroughs completed the text of Naked Lunch Ecstasy of the Beats: On the Road to Understanding, by David Creighton. Published by Dundurn Press Ltd., 2007. . Page 126. and began his lifelong collaboration with Brion Gysin. It was also where Ian Sommerville became Burroughs' 'systems advisor' and lover. Gysin introduced Burroughs to the Cut- up technique and with Sommerville they experimented with a 'dream machine' and audio tape cut-ups. Here Norse wrote a novel, Beat Hotel, using cut-up techniques.Notebooks, by Tennessee Williams, Margaret Bradham Thornton. Published by Yale University Press, 2006. . Page 420. Ginsberg wrote a part of his moving and mature poem Kaddish at the hotel and Corso wrote the mushroom cloud-shaped poem Bomb. There is now a small hotel, the four-star Relais du Vieux Paris, at that address. It displays photographs of several Beat personalities and describes itself as \\"The Beat Hotel\\". In July 2009, as part of a major William Burroughs symposium, NakedLunch@50, a special tribute was held outside 9 Rue Gît-le-Coeur, with Jean-Jacques Lebel unveiling a plaque commemorative, now permanently hammered to the outside wall next to the main entrance, honoring the Beat Hotel's seven most famous occupants: B.

He was the manager of The Fortunes, Pinkerton's Assorted Colours, Screaming Lord Sutch, and other pop groups. In 1964, after hearing Radio Caroline, he decided to start his own pirate radio station, and made use of an old World War II fort in the Thames Estuary. Originally, the station was called Radio Sutch, and it started broadcasting on 27 May 1964, on 1542kHz. They had a summer of fun, but when Sutch decided to return to performing, Reg Calvert carried on, renamed it Radio City, and put it onto a more professional footing. Calvert was shot and killed by Oliver Smedley, the former owner of a rival offshore station, Radio Atlanta, who was later acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence. Radio City  Calvert established the pirate station Radio City, which broadcast from a Second World War marine fort off the Kent coast, seven miles from Margate. Radio Atlanta, the second pirate radio station, ran out of money and merged with Radio Caroline, which had also run out of money. It was decided that Calvert would be asked to amalgamate with them and they would pay the bills, giving Calvert 50% of the profit. After a couple of months, Radio Atlanta was again in financial difficulty and not paying bills or wages, so Calvert resumed control. Later in 1965, Major Oliver Smedley and Allan Crawford approached him again to go into partnership, on the proviso that they would provide a new transmitter. In December 1965, the transmitter arrived from Texas. It was old and very large, and the wrong sort of transmitter. The power pack fell in the sea as they tried to hoist it onto the station, and although it was dried out, the transmitter used too much power and was unsuitable. Neither Radio City nor Atlanta engineers could get it to work properly. Shortly afterwards, Atlanta sent Radio City a bill of £600 for the transport from Texas. Calvert returned it to Atlanta, on the grounds that the transmitter was its responsibility and could be collected at any time. Smedley approached Calvert again, saying he had someone interested in buying the station, and came to the office with a Mr Fablon to go through the accounts. By May 1965, Radio City was one of the few very profitable stations. Nothing further was heard from Fablon, but unknown to Calvert, Smedley had put together a company and, as chairman, was trying to sell shares in Radio City without Calvert's knowledge. In June 1966, Calvert agreed to go into partnership with another pirate station, Radio London. When Smedley telephoned Calvert to tell him he again had some buyers interested, Calvert explained he was entering into a partnership with Radio London instead. Smedley shouted abuse down the telephone and decided to take over Radio City with a boarding party in the middle of the night. Allan Crawford from Radio Atlanta refused to join in the boarding party. He tried to persuade Smedley not to go ahead with his plan, and told him not to use the name of Atlanta. Smedley's response was to hire a group of riggers, who boarded Radio City on 20 June and put the station's transmitter out of action. First Smedley contacted Phillip Birch from Radio London and demanded £5,000 and half the profits to take his men off. Birch accused him of blackmail and refused to pay. Next, Smedley demanded the same of Calvert, who also refused. News from Radio City was that the boarders were armed and would destroy all the equipment if Calvert or anyone else tried to evict them. Calvert went to the police to ask for their support, but they refused as it was outside their legal jurisdiction. They suggested he should sort it out with Smedley. Calvert tried repeatedly to do so but Smedley was never available - he was trying to sell the station to Radio 390. Homicide On 21 June, Calvert visited Smedley's home at Wendens Ambo, Essex, to request the removal of the raiders and the return of vital transmitter parts. Calvert was shot dead by Smedley in what has been described as a \\"violent row\\".

Forest Press, 1996, p. 139 Smedley claimed that he feared Calvert was there to kill him and he was acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence. Calvert was buried on 1 July 1966 at St Peter's, Dunchurch. Screaming Lord Sutch and members of the group Pinkerton's Assorted Colours were among the mourners at the funeral. Critical response Partly in response to the sensational death of Calvert, and lurid tales of piracy, the British government passed the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, which made offshore broadcasting a criminal offence as of 15 August 1967. Radio City stopped broadcasting after Calvert's wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1946,General Register Office indices of Birth, Marriages and Deaths appeared in court charged under the older Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, because the station was sited within the limit. Radio City closed down shortly after Dorothy Calvert lost the case. Personal life His wife Dorothy Rowe Calvert died on 21 February 2010. Her funeral and interment, also at St Peter's, Dunchurch, took place on 5 March 2010.

Historically the street was a location for toll gates, from which it derives its modern name.  Location  At Ossington Street/Kensington Palace Gardens, the Bayswater Road becomes Notting Hill Gate, continuing westward until it becomes Holland Park Avenue, just before it reaches Ladbroke Grove. Notting Hill Gate is distinct from Notting Hill, although the two are often confused, with \\"Notting Hill\\" being used as an abbreviation of \\"Notting Hill Gate\\" and \\"Notting Hill Gate\\" suggesting to outsiders that it is the full description of Notting Hill. In fact, however, the street named Notting Hill Gate is well to the south of the hill (with its summit at the junction of Ladbroke Grove and Kensington Park Gardens) which gives its name to the area known (long before the establishment of the Notting Hill toll gate) as Notting Hill.  Character  Notting Hill Gate is home to a variety of stores, restaurants, cafés and estate agents as well as more specialist stores which include rare records and antiques, as well as two historic cinemas, the Coronet (originally opened as a theatre in 1898) and the Gate, as well as also several bars and clubs.  1950s redevelopment  Much of the street was redeveloped in the 1950s with two large tower blocks being erected on the north and south sides of the street. At this time Notting Hill Gate tube station was also redeveloped linking two stations on the Circle and District and Central lines which had previously been accessed on either side of the street with an entirely underground station enabling interchange between the deep level Central Line and the sub-surface Circle and District Lines. The new tube station also acts as a pedestrian subway under the widened Notting Hill Gate, the subway leading to the ticket office, a toilet (now closed) and a newsagent (now closed). Not all of Notting Hill Gate's original features were lost when it was redeveloped however, one good example of this being the Notting Hill Coronet.Coronet website Previously a theatre, it was converted into a cinema in 1923, and was saved from demolition by local activists in 1972 and 1989. In 2004, its long- term future was secured by the Kensington Temple who acquired the site with the intention of continuing to provide independent cinema. The Coronet is one of two famous cinemas on Notting Hill Gate, the other being the GateThe Gate history which opened in 1911 and still retains its Edwardian plasterwork, including a heavily coffered ceiling.  Transport links  Notting Hill Gate tube station northeastern entrance Notting Hill Gate is the site of Notting Hill Gate tube station which is on the Central, District and Circle lines. It is also on the route of the 27, 28, 31, 52, 70, 94, 148, 328, 390, 452, N28, N31, N52 and N207 buses as well as the 24-hour Oxford Tube (coach) service. There are several bus stops along both sides of Notting Hill Gate. Although there are no taxi ranks on Notting Hill Gate itself it is easy to hail a black cab anywhere on the street.  Environs  To the south of Notting Hill Gate lies Kensington Church Street, with its restaurants and antique shops, Hillgate Village (a name given to the area immediately south of Notting Hill Gate with its multi-coloured houses) and Campden Hill Road. North from the tube station lies Pembridge Road, which leads to Westbourne Grove. This area is often packed with tourists heading to the nearby Portobello Road market, or to spot locations from the film Notting Hill. The Notting Hill Gate Improvement GroupNotting Hill Gate Improvement Group website aims to improve the environment of Notting Hill Gate and neighbouring streets, working in partnership with the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and Land Securities and Delancey plc, which own many of the 1950s buildings. However, the London Evening Standard reported on 17 May 2010 that Land Securities and Delancey have put their Notting Hill Gate estate up for sale, with an asking price of £130 million. The freehold estate includes about two- thirds of Notting Hill Gate and part of Kensington Church Street. Land Securities, which has owned it since the '50s, in partnership with Delancey Estates since 2004, decided to sell after plans to brighten up the area foundered in 2005 in the face of local and council opposition.

This system, called \\"The Kabbalah of the Nine Chambers\\" by later authors, used the Hebrew alphabet rather than the Latin alphabet, and was used for religious symbolism rather than for any apparent cryptological purpose.Agrippa, Cornelius. \\"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\\", http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp3c.htm#chap30 Variations of this cipher were used by both the Rosicrucian brotherhoodPratt, pp. 142-143 and the Freemasons, though the latter used the pigpen cipher so often that the system is frequently called the Freemason's cipher. Hysin claims it was invented by Freemasons.Hynson, Colin. \\"Codes and ciphers.\\" 5 to 7 Educator 2006.14 (2006): v-vi. They began using it in the early 18th century to keep their records of history and rites private, and for correspondence between lodge leaders.Kahn, 1967, p.~772Newton, 1998, p. 113 Tombstones of Freemasons can also be found which use the system as part of the engravings. One of the earliest stones in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City, which opened in 1697, contains a cipher of this type which deciphers to \\"Remember death\\" (cf. \\"memento mori\\"). George Washington's army had documentation about the system, with a much more randomized form of the alphabet. And during the American Civil War, the system was used by Union prisoners in Confederate prisons. Example Using the Pigpen cipher key shown in the example above, the message \\"\`X MARKS THE SPOT\`\\" is rendered in ciphertext as An example pigpen message Variants The core elements of this system are the grid and dots. Some systems use the X's, but even these can be rearranged. One commonly used method orders the symbols as shown in the above image: grid, grid, X, X. Another commonly used system orders the symbols as grid, X, grid, X. Another is grid, grid, grid, with each cell having a letter of the alphabet, and the last one having an \\"&\\" character. Letters from the first grid have no dot, letters from the second each have one dot, and letters from the third each have two dots. Another variation of this last one is called the Newark Cipher, which instead of dots uses one to three short lines which may be projecting in any length or orientation. This gives the illusion of a larger number of different characters than actually exist.Glossary of Cryptography Another system, used by the Rosicrucians, used a single grid of nine cells, and 1 to 3 dots in each cell or \\"pen\\". So ABC would be in the top left pen, followed by DEF and GHI on the first line, then groups of JKL MNO PQR on the second, and STU VWX YZ on the third. When enciphered, the location of the dot in each symbol (left, center, or right), would indicate which letter in that pen was represented. More difficult systems use a non-standard form of the alphabet, such as writing it backwards in the grid, up and down in the columns, or a completely randomized set of letters. The Templar cipher is a method claimed to have been used by the Knights Templar. It uses a variant of a Maltese Cross.

He also became manager of George Lazenby, who played James Bond in one film. Biography =Background= O'Rahilly was born in Dublin, the third of five children. His parents owned the private port at Greenore, County Louth, on Carlingford Lough. His grandfather Michael O'Rahilly (The O'Rahilly) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of Ireland, a leader in the Easter Rising, who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916. O'Rahilly described himself as a rebel who had been expelled from school seven times. He started living in London at the age of 17. \\"'The station revolutionised radio for a generation': Ronan O'Rahilly, founder of Radio Caroline, dies aged 79\\", The Journal, 21 April 2020. Retrieved 21 April 2020 =London club scene= Before he founded Radio Caroline, O'Rahilly started training in method acting in London, frequented nightclubs and became acquainted with such entertainment industry figures as Giorgio Gomelsky and Simon Dee. He then ran a night club, the Scene, off Great Windmill Street in Soho, London, where in 1963 the Rolling Stones played, amongst others including Zoot Money and Chris Farlowe. He became the manager of musicians, such as Alexis Korner and Georgie Fame, Alexis Petridis, \\"Ronan O'Rahilly, Radio Caroline founder who inspired UK pop and pirate radio, dies aged 79\\", The Guardian, 21 April 2020. Retrieved 22 April 2020 and helped to persuade the Animals to move to London. Alan Price said of O'Rahilly: \\"Ronan knew how things were done; he was very hip, he really fancied himself, but he had a lot of 'get up and go' and verve. He helped to launch the Animals\\". He tried to persuade radio stations to play a promotional acetate record by Georgie Fame, a practice that was almost unheard of at the time. He took the record to the BBC to try to get it played, and discovered that the record industry was dominated by EMI and Decca. He then tried to get it played on Radio Luxembourg and again found that the shows were \\"owned\\" by major labels EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips. They were essentially \\"payola\\" shows, featuring only music from labels willing and able to pay for them to be played. He said \\"I have recorded the guy, so I can't get it played, so we have to start a radio station.\\" =Radio Caroline= He then set about creating the pirate radio station Radio Caroline, which began broadcasting in 1964 from a ship, the MV Caroline, anchored in international waters off the coast of Essex, eastern England.\\"The Ship that Rocked the World\\" by Tom Lodge, Paperback: 164 pages, Publisher: Umi Foundation (July 1, 2003), Language: English, , The idea for the station was based partly on a plan by Australian music publisher Allan Crawford (who had spent almost two years planning the launch of Radio Atlanta) and also on Radio Veronica, which had been broadcasting off the Netherlands since 1960. Radio Caroline was largely funded by financier John Sheffield (great uncle of Samantha Cameron) and Carl Ross (creator of the Ross fishery frozen food business and grandfather of David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse) and publisher Jocelyn Stevens. In 1965, the Caroline and Atlanta companies merged under the Radio Caroline name, their two ships giving greater coverage of the United Kingdom. Broadcasts ceased in 1968, the ships' operations having been hampered by UK legislation in the previous year, which also saw new competition from the BBC's Radio 1. O'Rahilly was involved in the reappearance of Radio Caroline in several forms during the 1970s and 1980s. = Other initiatives = In 1966, O'Rahilly gave businessman Phil Solomon a share in Radio Caroline, and with him set up Major Minor Records, whose acts including The Dubliners and David McWilliams were then promoted by the station. O'Rahilly also attempted, but failed, to set up a Caroline TV station. In 1968, he became involved in the production of a number of films, including as executive producer on the Marianne Faithfull film The Girl on a Motorcycle and on Two Virgins featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono. O'Rahilly became manager of the Australian model-turned-actor George Lazenby, who played James Bond in one film. During production of the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, O'Rahilly talked Lazenby into refusing a seven-film Bond contract on grounds that the James Bond character was out of touch with the times, and would not successfully continue into the 1970s.Masheter, Philip George Lazenby Interview The Making of On Her Majesty's Secret Service Movie Collector Magazine Vol Two Issue Two Of this advice, Roger Moore said in his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, \\"George took some bad advice ... I knew George then and have met him many times since. He admits he made a mistake\\". O'Rahilly also appeared in Lazenby's film Universal Soldier where both men were credited as executive producers. O'Rahilly briefly managed the American rock band The MC5 in the early 1970s. Later in the decade, claiming that people \\"found it easier to talk about hate than love\\", and influenced by spiritual leader Ram Dass, he developed the philosophy of \\"Loving Awareness\\", which was then heavily promoted on Caroline. In 1976 an album of songs based on the concept was recorded by the Loving Awareness Band, a group assembled by O'Rahilly for the purpose. Several members of the band went on to form the Blockheads. =Later life= In December 2007, O'Rahilly was inducted as a Fellow of the Radio Academy. O'Rahilly was inducted into the Hall Of Fame at the PPI Radio Awards, held at the Lyrath Hotel, Kilkenny, Ireland, on 12 October 2012.Radio Academy Honours Offshore Pioneers Radio London – Current Happenings Q4 2007The Radio Academy \\"Fellows\\" In 2012, O'Rahilly was diagnosed with vascular dementia and returned to live in County Louth, Ireland, in sight of the port of Greenore where Radio Caroline was \\"born\\" in the 1960s. He lived in a nursing home at Carlingford. He died on 20 April 2020, at the age of 79. Personal life O'Rahilly married Catherine Hamilton-Davies in 1993.

A quarterback sneak is a play in gridiron football in which the quarterback, upon taking the center snap, dives ahead while the offensive line surges forward. It is usually only used in very short yardage situations. The advantages of this play are that there are no further ball exchanges beyond the center snap, and that the quarterback receives the ball almost at the line of scrimmage so that it is unlikely that significant yardage could be lost on the play. However, it is also very unlikely that the play will gain more than one or two yards. For this reason, it is almost solely used when the ball is very close to the goal-line or on third and fourth down with a yard or less to go. The origins of this play date back to 1912 where standout Yale quarterback Graham Winkelbaum first used it in a game against rival Harvard. Quarterback sneaks are statistically the most likely plays to convert short yardage situations, though each situation varies. Many football statistics sites advocate for increased usage of the play. QB sneaks have drawbacks in that they tend to expose the quarterback to hits from opposing defensive backs. Often quarterbacks do not wish to expose themselves to the increased risk of injury associated with the play. This is especially prevalent in elite pocket passing quarterbacks, such as Drew Brees or Tom Brady. Perhaps the most famous quarterback sneak in football history was executed by Bart Starr of the Green Bay Packers in the famous \\"Ice Bowl\\" National Football League championship game against the Dallas Cowboys on December 31, 1967. Despite the \\"sneak\\" moniker, the play is often expected in situations where a short gain is needed.

Early life Smedley was born in Godstone, Surrey, on 19 February 1911, the son of William Herbert and Olivia Kate Smedley. His father was a director of the Gramophone Company. Military Smedley enlisted on 17 April 1939 in the Royal Artillery and was commissioned in April 1940. He served in Iraq, North Africa, Sicily and Italy before D-Day. He won the Military Cross in December 1944 for his actions on 11 July 1944 at Audrieu in the battle for Normandy. He became a paratrooper and participated in Operation Market Garden. Politics and economics Smedley described himself as an \\"uncompromising free-trader and libertarian\\".Cockett, p. 125. In opposition to Clement Attlee's Agriculture Act 1947, Smedley helped to found, and become Secretary of, the Farmers' and Smallholders' Association in 1947. Its first President was the Conservative MP Waldron Smithers.Cockett, p. 126. In 1952 Smedley resigned from his job as a chartered accountant and campaigned for economic liberalism from his office in EC2. S. W. Alexander, editor of the City Press, used the newspaper to publicise Smedley's campaigns. Smedley later described himself and Alexander as \\"the only active free-traders left in England in the 1950s\\". His main campaigning organisation was the Cheap Food League which was against all types of protection and subsidy in agriculture, especially marketing boards. During a potato shortage in 1955, Smedley said: \\"The NFU statement confirms my view that the union leaders care not whether the people starve, provided the potato growers are permanently protected from the cold wind of overseas competition. Such callous irresponsibility has been unknown in the land since the days of the Corn Laws\\".Norman McCord, The Anti-Corn Law League (London: Unwin University Books, 1975), p. 211. In a protest against high taxation he founded the Council for the Reduction of Taxation in 1954. Then in 1955, whilst a member of the Society of Individualists, Smedley met Antony Fisher and together they founded a new research institute to propagate economic liberalism, called, on Smedley's suggestion, the Institute of Economic Affairs.Cockett, p. 130. However, Fisher and Ralph Harris (director of the IEA) were concerned with Smedley's links with the Liberal Party and in 1959 Harris moved the IEA's office from Smedley's EC2 office to Hobart Place.Cockett, p. 137. Smedley took over the Free Trade League and the Cobden Club in 1958. Smedley was also a Liberal politician, standing against Rab Butler in Saffron Walden in the general elections of 1950 and 1951. In all he contested eighteen Parliamentary elections. According to Richard Cockett Smedley and Alfred Suenson-Taylor \\"sought to keep the flames of Gladstonian Liberalism burning within the [Liberal] Party\\" and to oppose the influence of William Beveridge and John Maynard Keynes.Cockett, p. 127. Smedley was a critic of what he considered to be the Liberal Party's abandonment of free trade and self-improvement. In a speech in Westminster on 8 November 1952 Smedley said: > It surely becomes clearer every day that no significant issue really divides > the front benches of the House of Commons...A tremendous responsibility > therefore rests on Liberals inside the House and out, to tell the people the > truth. Members of the other parties cannot bring themselves to do so...We > must warn the people that there can be no hope of survival in an intensely > competitive world if our energies, enterprise and adaptability continue to > be fettered by the outmoded trappings and controls of the centrally planned > economy. He left the Liberal Party in 1962 due to his opposition to their favourable attitude to British membership of the European Economic Community. He founded the Keep Britain Out campaign to oppose British membership of the EEC. The Times claimed that Smedley \\"believed that the EEC undermined the sovereignty of Britain and he was relentless in his efforts to save Britain from the high food prices of the protectionist common agricultural policies\\". In 1982 he founded the Free Trade Liberal Party with Alexander. Bars and nightclubs Smedley also owned and ran a bar and nightclub in Albufeira, Portugal, called the Seven and the Seven and a Half. Tom Jones and others performed there, as well as his son Charles Smedley (he had two children, the other is Emma Currie). Pirate radio In 1964, with Alan Crawford, Smedley helped to form the British company Project Atlanta Limited that successfully launched Radio Atlanta, Britain's second full-time offshore commercial pirate radio station. The station used a ship that had once been the home of Radio Nord. Radio Atlanta eventually merged with the Caroline Organization led by Irishman Ronan O'Rahilly, and changed its name to Radio Caroline South. When Reginald Calvert, manager of The Fortunes pop group, founded a rival pirate station Radio City, Smedley tried to persuade Calvert to amalgamate with Radio Caroline in exchange for a new transmitter. The transmitter turned out to be antiquated and did not work properly (one of its sections had been accidentally dropped into the sea prior to being installed, though it is uncertain as to whether this was responsible for its malfunctioning) and Calvert refused to pay for it. Smedley in response hired a group of riggers to board Radio City and retrieve the transmitter.BBC, Adam Curtis, 13 September 2011: Back Stories – The Curse of Tina The next day (21 June 1966) he received threatening phone calls from Calvert and that night Calvert went to Smedley's house at Wendens Ambo, Essex.

Vivo Software designed the Vivo Video/Audio platform, including its encoding tools and end-user VivoActive Player. The Vivo format, obsolete today, was one of the first to be designed and used for internet streaming. The Vivo platform was a well-known player when streaming media was in its infancy and was deployed mainly on erotic sites during the mid-1990s. Since then RealPlayer, QuickTime and Windows Media have evolved as the dominant platforms. The development of Vivo ceased in 1997 to be replaced by RealPlayer from RealNetworks.

The Vivo format is based upon H.263 video and G.723 ADPCM audio (not the G.723.1 speech codec). It uses inter-frame coding, but does not insert any key frames, except at the beginning of the clip, which effectively disables the possibility of seeking to specific locations in the stream.

It occurs when the lymphocyte is activated by an antigen (from antigen-presenting cells) and increased in volume by nucleus and cytoplasm growth as well as new mRNA and protein synthesis. The lymphoblast then starts dividing two to four times every 24-hours for 3-5 days, with a single lymphoblast making approximately 1000 clones of its original naive lymphocyte, with each sharing the originally unique antigen specificity. Finally the dividing cells differentiate into effector cells, known as Plasma Cells (for B cells), Cytotoxic T cells, and Helper T cells.Janeway's Immunobiology, 9th edition, Chapter 1, page 23 Lymphoblasts can also refer to immature cells which typically differentiate to form mature lymphocytes. Normally lymphoblasts are found in the bone marrow, but in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblasts proliferate uncontrollably and are found in large numbers in the peripheral blood. The size is between 10 and 20 μm. Although commonly lymphoblast refers to a precursor cell in the maturation of leukocytes, the usage of this term is sometimes inconsistent. The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium defines a lymphoblast as \\"A lymphocyte that has become larger after being stimulated by an antigen. Lymphoblasts look like immature lymphocytes, and were once thought to be precursor cells.\\"CRC - Glossary L Commonly, when speaking about leukemia, \\"blast\\" is used as an abbreviation for lymphoblasts. Lymphoblasts can be distinguished microscopically from myeloblasts by having less distinct nucleoli, more condensed chromatin, and an absence of cytoplasmic granules. However these morphologic distinctions are not absolute and a definitive diagnosis relies on antibody immunostaining for the presence of unique cluster of differentiation receptors. 8th edition.

Ossington Street forms part of the border between the boroughs City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, with the east side of the street belonging to Westminster and the west side to Kensington. It is possible that the street was named after Viscount Ossington. Despite its minor nature, Ossington Street is one of the more notable 'runs' of The Knowledge in the area, as a route for taxi drivers to get from Westbourne Grove to Notting Hill Gate. The nearest Tube station to Ossington Street is Notting Hill Gate, followed by Queensway and Bayswater.  History  Ossington Street was originally laid out from the then Uxbridge Road to Moscow Road on part of Gravel Pit field in the 1830s. It was known at the time as Victoria Grove, and was renamed to Ossington Street in 1837 and transferred to Kensington. The buildings to the west side were in the form of terraced cottages of two storeys and basement, with a mews behind. Victoria Grove Mews retains its name to this day. Several of the terraced houses to the south were leased to William Ward, a Marylebone builder, who also filled a space along the Uxbridge Road between Victoria Grove and the then boundary of Paddington with an inn and five shops, nos. 1 to 6 Wellington Terrace, around 1840. By 1865, almost all of Bayswater had been built up and the only sites for infilling were south of Moscow Road and in particular along the east side of Victoria Grove.

Generally a reel has a cylindrical core and walls on the sides to retain the material wound around the core. In some cases the core is hollow, although other items may be mounted on it, and grips may exist for mechanically turning the reel. Construction The size of the core is dependent on several factors. A smaller core will obviously allow more material to be stored in a given space. However, there is a limit to how tightly the stored material can be wound without damaging it and this limits how small the core can be. Other issues affecting the core size include: * Mechanical strength of the core (especially with big reels) * Acceptable turning speed (for a given rate of material moving on or off the reel a smaller core will mean that an almost empty reel has to turn faster) * any functional requirements of the core e.g. ** For a reel that must be mechanically turned the size of the grips that mount it on the mechanical turning device. ** The size of the mountings needed to support the core during unwinding. ** Anything mounted on the cores (e.g. the sockets on an extension reel) With material such as photographic film that is flat and long but is relatively wide, the material generally is stored in successive single layers. In cases where the material is more uniform in cross-section (for example, a cable), the material may be safely wound around a reel that is wider than its width. In this case, several windings are needed to create a layer on the reel. Uses A badge reel Examples include: * A fishing reel is used on a fishing rod to wind the fishing line up * Many audio recordings of the late 20th century (and some today) use reel-to-reel magnetic tape * Kite lines are frequently operated from reels * Specialized reels for holding tow line for hang glider, glider, and sailplane launching * Laying of communications table use giant reels * Winches wind cables on reels * Webbing barriers that allow mobile post positions collect tensionally excess webbing * Tow trucks hold steel cable on reels * Garden hoses reeled solve hose kink problems * Rope, wire and electrical cable is often supplied on reels * Badge reels are used to hold badges, ski passes and the like * A cave diving reel is safety equipment used for running a guideline (also known as a distance line) Motion picture terminology 35mm film reels and boxes 16mm empty film reel with its metal container It is traditional to discuss the length of theatrical motion pictures in terms of \\"reels\\". The standard length of a 35 mm film reel is , which runs approximately 11 minutes for sound film (24 frames per second)Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Volume 26. Ed. Society of Motion Picture Engineers, 1936. P. 93 and about 15 minutes for silent film at the more-or-less standard speed of 16 frames per second. Most films have visible cues which mark the end of the reel. This allows projectionists running reel-to-reel to change over to the next reel on the other projector. A so-called \\"two-reeler\\" would have run about 15–24 minutes since the actual short film shipped to a movie theater for exhibition may have had slightly less (but rarely more) than on it. Most modern projectionists use the term \\"reel\\" when referring to a \\"two-reeler\\", as modern films are rarely shipped by single reels. A standard Hollywood movie averages about five 2,000-foot reels in length. The \\"reel\\" was established as a standard measurement because of considerations in printing motion picture film at a film laboratory, for shipping (especially the film case sizes) and for the size of the physical film magazine attached to the motion picture projector. Had it not been standardized (at of 35 mm film) there would have been many difficulties in the manufacture of the related equipment. A 16 mm \\"reel\\" is . It runs, at sound speed, approximately the same amount of time (11–12 minutes) as a 35 mm reel. A \\"split reel\\" is a motion picture film reel in two halves that, when assembled, hold a specific length of motion picture film that has been wound on a plastic core. Using a split reel allows film to be shipped or handled in a lighter and smaller form than film would on a \\"fixed\\" reel. In silent film terminology, two films on one reel. As digital cinema catches on, the physical reel is being replaced by a virtual format called Digital Cinema Package, which can be distributed using any storage medium (such as hard drives) or data transfer medium (such as the Internet or satellite links) and projected using a digital projector instead of a conventional movie projector. A newsreel is a short documentary film. A showreel or demo reel is a short film showcasing a person's or an organization's previous work.

It was formed in 1879 as the United African Company and renamed to National African Company in 1881 and to Royal Niger Company in 1886. In 1929 the company became part of the United Africa Company, which came under the control of Unilever in the 1930s and continued to exist as a subsidiary of Unilever until 1987, when it was absorbed into the parent company. The company existed for a comparatively short time (1879–1900) but was instrumental in the formation of Colonial Nigeria, as it enabled the British Empire to establish control over the lower Niger against the German competition led by Bismarck during the 1890s. In 1900, the company-controlled territories became the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, which was in turn united with the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914 (which eventually gained independence within the same borders as the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1960). United African Company  Richard Lander first explored the area of Nigeria as the servant of Hugh Clapperton. In 1830, he returned to the river with his brother John; in 1832, he returned again (without his brother) to establish a trading post for the \\"African Steamship Company\\" at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers. The expedition failed, with 40 of the 49 members dying of fever or wounds from native attacks. One of the survivors, Macgregor Laird, subsequently remained in Britain but directed and funded expeditions to the country until his death in 1861. He opposed the failed Niger expedition of 1841 but the success of the Pleiad’s first mission in 1854 led to annual trips under Baikie and the 1857 foundation of Lokoja at the Niger–Benue confluence. There were no voyages for the three years following Laird's death, but the establishment of the was soon followed by several other firms. The competition reduced prices to the point that profits were minimal. Arriving in the region in 1877,Máthé-Shires, László. \\"Lagos Colony and Oil Rivers Protectorate\\" in the Encyclopedia of African History, Vol. 3, pp. 791–792. Accessed 5 Apr 2014. George Goldie argued for the amalgamation of the surviving British firms into a single monopolistic chartered company, a method contemporaries supposed had been buried with the ultimate failure of the East India Company following the Sepoy Rebellion. By 1879, he had helped combine James Crowther's WAC, David Macintosh's , and the William Brothers' and James Pinnock's firms into a single ; he then acted as the combined firm's agent in the territory. Almost immediately, the firm saw renewed competition as two French firms—the French Equatorial African Association and the Senegal Company—and another English one—the Liverpool and Manchester Trading Company—begin establishing posts on the river as well.McPhee, Allan. The Economic Revolution in British West Africa, pp. 75 ff. Frank Cass & Co. Ltd. (Abingdon), 1926 and reprinted 1971. Accessed 4 Apr 2014. A native attack on the UAC's outpost at Onitsha in 1879 was repulsed with help from HMS Pioneer but the Gladstone administration subsequently denied Goldie's attempt to procure a government charter in 1881, on the grounds that the international rivalry might occasion unnecessary conflict and that the united firm was undercapitalized for the expense of genuine colonial administration. National African Company George Goldie in 1898. Goldie first began addressing the administration's concerns by increasing the company's capitalization to £100 000\\\\. He then managed to corral £1 000 000 in investments in a new concern—the —which bought up the UAC and its interests in 1882.\\"Chartered Companies\\" in the Encyclopædia Britannica, 10th ed. The death of Léon Gambetta the same year deprived the French companies of their support within the French government and the strong subsidies it had been providing them. Goldie's cash-flush NAC was then able to maintain 30 trading posts along the riverGeary, Sir William N.M. (1927), pp. 174 ff. and ruin its competition in a two-year price war: by October 1884 all three had permitted him to buy out their interests in the region and the NAC's annual report for 1885 was able to crow that it \\"remained alone in undisputed commercial possession of the Niger–Binué region\\". This monopoly permitted Britain to resist French and German calls to internationalize trade on the Niger river during the negotiations at the 1884–1885 Berlin Conference on African colonization. Goldie himself attended the meetings and successfully argued for including the region of the NAC's operations within a British sphere of interest. Pledges from him and the British diplomats that free trade (or, in any case, non- discriminatory tariff rates) would be respected in their territory were dead letters: the NAC's over 400 treaties with local leaders obliged the natives to trade solely with or through the company's agents. Large tariffs and license fees eliminated competing firms from the area. The terms of these private contracts were made into general treaties by the British consuls, whose own treaties expressly incorporated them.Geary, Sir William Nevill Montgomerie. Nigeria under British Rule, p. 95\\\\. Frank Cass & Co, 1927. Accessed 5 Apr 2014. Similarly, when King Jaja of Opobo organized his own trading network and even began running his own shipments of palm oil to Britain, he was lured onto a British warship and shipped into exile on Saint Vincent on charges of \\"treaty breaking\\" and \\"obstructing commerce\\". Despite treaties extending British control over the tribes of the Cameroons, however, Britain was willing to recognize the German colony that usurped the area in 1885 as a check on French activity in the upper Congo and Ubangi watersheds. The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming The Royal Niger Company Chartered and Limited (normally shortened to the Royal Niger Company), with Lord Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor. Niger Company It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence its charter was revoked in 1899 and, on 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British Government for the sum of £865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of northern and southern Nigeria. The company changed its name to The Niger Company Ltd and in 1929 became part of the United Africa Company. The United Africa Company came under the control of Unilever in the 1930s and continued to exist as a subsidiary of Unilever until 1987, when it was absorbed into the parent company.

He is best known for using his pirate wealth to found a short-lived kingdom on Madagascar. History Plantain was English, born in Jamaica, and served as a sailor aboard Edward England’s pirate flotilla (having once served on Christopher Condent's Dragon) which captured the East India Company ship Cassandra from Captain James Macrae in 1720. After looting the ship the collected pirates sailed to Madagascar, divided their plunder, and sailed their separate ways. Plantain and a number of others remained behind, some voluntarily and some not. With two others he moved to Ranter Bay (site of modern Rantabe), spending his plunder and befriending the Malagasay natives to build a settlement. He styled himself “King of Ranter Bay.” He organized the locals to make war against their neighbors, using firearms to swing the battles his way. He kept himself and his allies supplied by trading with passing ships, offering food, water, supplies, and slaves taken as captives in wars against his neighbors in exchange for guns, gunpowder and shot, clothes, and other goods. The pirates, Plantain included, took multiple Malagasay wives and lavished them with treasures. He demanded the granddaughter of a neighboring king as his wife; the king refused, setting off a series of wars and counter-raids, from which Plantain eventually emerged victorious. A Royal Navy squadron visited Madagascar in 1722 looking for Richard Taylor, Olivier Levasseur, and England. Plantain advised them that the pirates had long since departed and invited the officers to visit his settlement. Reportedly England himself was present, haggard and near death; he had been deposed from command by Taylor on the grounds of being too kind to the Cassandra’s Captain. Having made too many enemies on Madagascar Plantain took his favored wife and moved to India in 1728, serving in the Maratha navy under Koli Admiral Kanhoji Angre. Plantain’s ultimate fate is not known. When he left to fight various battles he generally buried his wealth on the island and dug it up when he returned, but rumors of Plantain’s buried treasure persisted.

In the period 1964-1968 regular jazz performances were organized by Novum Jazz, which attracted an artistic and progressive crowd to Wolbodo. Whereas for most student societies the membership ends with the finishing of the study (whether the student has graduated or not) at a certain point in time Wolbodo decided that one should be able to be a member whenever one thought of Wolbodo as a place to feel at home. Influenced by changing attitudes in the 1970s, Wolbodo started calling itself a people society (mensenvereniging) instead of student society and dropped the St in front of the name. Nowadays most people prefer to write it as Menschen Vereeniging, the same words, written in pre-WWII Dutch. Although Wolbodo isn't a student only society, there is still a strong connection to the Delft University of Technology and Delft student life. In 2010 Wolbodo had about 80 members. Structure In contrast to most student societies that are highly hierarchically structured, Wolbodo is horizontally structured. This is a preciously cultivated form of anarchy within the society. The only form of organisation within the society is the presence of a board. Residence Wolbodo's residence is a building located at the Verwersdijk in Delft and is called Novum (new). The main area of this building is the parlor, which can hold up to 100 individuals in the bar. Novum is the property of a foundation, Intra Muros (between walls), better known as IM. The foundation also provides for the necessary maintenance of the building.

Born in Jacksonville to Isaiah Hart, one of the city's founders, he was raised on his father's plantation along the St. Johns River. He was a lawyer in Jacksonville. He moved to a farm near Fort Pierce, Florida in 1843, and was a founding member of the St. Lucie County Board of Commissioners.Shofner, Jerrell H., History of Brevard County volume 1 In 1845, Hart became Florida State Representative for St. Lucie County.

Hart owned slaves prior to the Civil War.Tampa in Civil War and Reconstruction by Carter Brown Jr. Page 12 Despite his upbringing, Hart became a Republican and openly opposed secession from the United States, causing some difficult times for him during the American Civil War. Following the war, he helped reestablish the governments of the state and of the city of Jacksonville. In 1868, he was appointed a justice of the Florida Supreme Court. In 1870, he ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress, only to be elected governor two years later on January 7, 1873. He appointed Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs as Florida's first African-American Superintendent of Public Instruction. During his tenure, \\"limited civil rights legislation was passed, and some improvements were made in the state's weakened finances.\\" Weakened by the campaign, he fell ill with pneumonia and died in Jacksonville.

Archaeologist Chapuruka Kusimba contends that the Mijikenda formerly resided in coastal cities, but later settled in Kenya's hinterlands to avoid submission to dominant Portuguese forces that were then in control. Historically, these Mijikenda ethnic groups have been called the Nyika or Nika by outsiders. It is a derogatory term meaning \\"bush people.\\" The nine Ethnic groups that make up the Mijikenda peoples are the Chonyi, Kambe, Duruma, Kauma, Ribe, Rabai, Jibana, and Giriama. They are the northern Mijikenda while the Digo are southern Mijikenda. the Digo are also found in Tanzania due to their proximity to the common border. Culture Replica of a Giriama hut Each of the Mijikenda groups has a sacred forest, a kaya, which is a place of prayer. Eleven of the approximately 30 kaya forests have been inscribed together as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests. Mijikenda people are also known for creating wooden kigango funerary statues which have been displayed in museums around the world and sold in the international art market. These artifacts were at one time legally sold by reputable art galleries and curio shops during the early 1970s to the 1990s; however, other kigango statues were found to have been stolen from cultural sites and illegally sold. Each Mijikenda ethnic group has its own unique customs and dialects of the Mijikenda language, although the dialects are similar to each other and to Swahili.  History and ethnography of the Mijikenda peoples  = Origins = The orthodox view of the Mijikenda's origins is that the Mijikenda peoples originated in Shungwaya (Singwaya) and various other parts of the northern Somali coast, and where pushed south by the Galla (Oromo) and reached Kenya around the 16th century. This view of the origins of the Mijikenda people was argued by Thomas Spear in the book The Kaya Complex, and was also confirmed by many Mijikenda oral traditions. Furthermore, oral tradition states that the precise reason for the Galla pushing the Mijikenda from Singwaya was the murder of a Galla Tribesman by a Mijikenda youth, and the Mijikenda tribes subsequent refusal to pay compensation to the Galla.Republic of Kenya. NOMINATION DOSSIER FOR INSCRIPTION ON THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST THE SACRED MIJIKENDA KAYA FORESTS. Unesco.org. THE WORLD HERITAGE CONVENTION, Jan. 2008. Web. 17 Oct. 2016. Pg. 51 - Pg. 61 However it has also been theorized that the Mijikenda peoples may have originated in roughly the same places they currently reside. One possible explanation for this is that the Mijikenda peoples adopted the Singwaya narrative in order to create an ethnic identity that allowed them to create a relationship to the Swahili who also claimed Singwaya origins.Bresnahan, David P. Sacred Spaces, Political Authority, and the Dynamics of Tradition in Mijikenda History. Thesis. 2010. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. Oral tradition also states that the Mijikenda peoples split into six separate peoples during this southern migration after they were driven out of Singwaya. These six groups would go on to settle the original six kaya. At the turn of the 17th century the Mijikenda settled six fortified hilltop kaya, where they made their homesteads. These original six kaya were later expanded into nine kaya. The origin legend serves as a narrative of a real migration that happened at a specific point in time to a real place, but also serves as a narrative of a mythical migration that took place through a cultural time from a common origin. It promotes a higher unity among the group of the nine individual ethnic groups that makes up the Mijikenda peoples. Singwaya is considered by the Mijikenda to be their common origin point, and the birthplace of their language and traditions. This origin legend also defines some of the relationships of the ethnic groups that make up the Mijikenda peoples, for example one version of the oral tradition states that the Digo were the first to leave Singwaya and thus are accepted as the other groups as senior, then the Ribe left, followed by the Giriama, the Chonyi, and the Jibana. = Kayas = thumb The kayas were the first homesteads of the Mijikenda peoples after their exodus from Singwaya. Oral tradition states that it was the Digo who were the first to migrate southward and establish the first kaya. The period after the establishment of the kaya and was portrayed as a time of stability by these oral traditions, this period ended in the mid to late 19th century with the rise of colonialism. The kaya also represented an important political symbol to the Mijikenda peoples, as well as being an important cultural symbol to the Mijikenda peoples. The political symbolism of the kaya also played a part in the resistance to colonialism for the Mijikenda peoples. Sometime during the late 19th century the Mijikenda peoples began leaving their kaya homesteads and settling areas elsewhere. The layout of the kaya settlements usually had centrally positioned areas devoted to leadership and worship, with other areas devoted to initiation ceremonies, areas for developing magic and medicine, and areas devoted to burials and entertainment placed around them. The forests of the kaya surrounding the settlement acted as a buffer between the settlement itself and the outside world. As the populations of these kaya grew, security grew which lead to a period of stability which allowed the Mijikenda people to spread outwards along the coasts and southwards along the border of Tanzania. Eventually all nine of the original kaya were abandoned as the Mijikenda settled elsewhere, however the importance of these kaya did not diminish, and they were still held as sacred sites. = Slavery = During the precolonial period the Mijikenda people were horticulturalists and pastoralists, And had well established trade with the coastal Swahili peoples. The Hinterland people (The Mijikenda, Pokomo, and Segeju peoples) grew food that the coastal Swahili people depended on. This trade relationship was based on economic, military, and political alliances. The Mijikenda peoples even participated in Mombasa politics. However, during the colonial period under the British power was given to the Coastal Swahili peoples and the Arab peoples of the area. The Coastal strip of land near the Hinterlands was recognized as belonging to the Sultan of Oman, subsequently the Mijikenda people could only go there as squatters and were in danger of expulsion at any time. The colonial power over the coastal areas also extended to the Hinterland regions where the Mijikenda people resided. One group of Mijikenda peoples, Known as the Giriama peoples were mistrustful of the British outsiders, with good reason, prior to the colonization of the coastal and hinterland areas this group had had its people captured by Arab/Swahili slave traders during the 19th century. Differing accounts of this period exist, with some sources stating that these enslaved Giriama peoples participated in a complex patron-client relationship which was important for the establishment of large scale plantations on the East African coast. This account goes on to say that these enslaved Giriama peoples were integrated into Swahili and Arab land owning families and were sometimes referred to as dependents rather than slaves. Overall the treatment of these slaves was not very harsh, due to the ease of escape, the kin-based patron-client system, and Islam's prohibition of harsh treatment of slaves. This is contrasted by the treatment of the slaves on the nearby islands such as Pemba or Zanzibar where slaves were treated more harshly. As slave ownership declined on the East African coast many of the Ex- slaves moved on to find employment as manual laborers on their former master's plantations and were paid a portion of the crop as compensation in a similar patron-client relationship as before. However some accounts state that the slavery that the Giriama people endured was harsher than was previously believed. Enslaved Giriama people were known to have fled by the hundreds to any sanctuary they could, in some cases seeking refuge in Christian Missionary stations, in other cases fleeing to runaway slave settlements. Additionally the idea that the transition from ex-slave to manual laborer was made difficult due to the British's fear that the fugitive and freed slaves would start a rebellion.

It is the administrative headquarters of Wardha district. Wardha gets its name from the Wardha River which flows at the north, west and south boundaries of district. Founded in 1866, the town is now an important center for the cotton trade. It was an important part of Gandhian Era. History Wardha was included in the empire of the Mauryas, Shungas, Satavahanas and Vakatakas. Pravarapura, modern Pavnar, was once the capital of the Vakataka dynasty. Vakatakas were contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya), was married to the Vakataka ruler Rudrasena. The period of the Vakatakas was from the 2nd to the 5th century CE. The empire stretched from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east, and from the Narmada River in the north to the Krishna-Godavari delta in south. Later on, Wardha was ruled by the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahamani Sultanate, the Muslim ruler of Berar, Gonds and Marathas. Raja Bakht Buland Shah of Gond Dynasty, Raghuji of Bhonsale were the prominent rulers in the Medieval period. During the 1850s Wardha district, (then a part of Nagpur district) fell into the hands of the British who included Wardha in the Central Province. In 1862 it was separated for convenient administrative purposes and Kawatha near Pulgaon was the district headquarters. In 1866, the district headquarters moved at Palakwadi village. The huts in the village were destroyed and a new city was constructed by English town-planner Sir Bachelor and Sir Reginald Craddock. This new city was named Wardha after the river Wardha which flows through the district. Wardha has an adjacent city Sevagram and both were major centers for the Indian Independence Movement, especially as the location for an annual meeting of the Indian National Congress in 1934, and Mahatma Gandhi's Ashram. Wardha was one of the pre-planned cities of British India. The town-planners were Sir Reginald Craddock and Sir Bachelor. In Craddock's memory, his name was given to the district's biggest school and an important road was named after Sir Bachelor in the British period. The Craddock School was renamed Mahatma Gandhi School. The District Hospital was named King George Hospital, but was renamed later on. The stone in which the old name was carved was at main gate for more than century. It was hidden by a new name board reading District Hospital. There are many buildings of the British period in the city which include Z.P. old building, the Central Jail, the Church at Bajajwadi, the Christian cemetery etc. The ancestors of powale group of industries lived here & the present owner of powale group of industries lives in wardha Geography and climate Wardha is located at .Wardha District at a Glance .

Thurber established the National Conservatory of Music of America in 1885—the first of its kind and an endeavor that some say ushered in the first orchestral music with a distinctively American sound. But in a very radical stance for the day, Thurber championed the rights of women, people of color and the handicapped to attend her school, sometimes on full scholarship. This was 1885—not too long after the Civil War—and her school was racially integrated, promoted women, and had an inclusive stance toward the handicapped. Thurber founded the school in part because of her belief that a nation should cultivate its own unique music—an unusual stance when the prevailing attitude was that all cultured art, especially orchestral music, came from Germany or Italy. While running the school, she sponsored competitions for American musicians to develop American music. “The National Conservatory of Music of America was the outstanding institution for professional musical preparation in the United States for some 25 years or more. At its height in the 1890s it boasted a faculty of international renown…and initiated a course of studies whose features became a basis for the curriculum now taken for granted in the colleges and conservatories of this country. Its achievements resulted from the endeavors of a single visionary: Jeannette M Thurber, a wealthy, idealistic New Yorker who devoted most of her life to the school…Although her innovative design for the Conservatory was influential in shaping the course of American music for the 20th century, Mrs. Thurber and her school have slipped into undeserved obscurity.” Life Jeannette Meyers was the daughter of Henry Meyers, an immigrant violinist from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Annamarie Coffin Price. She was educated at the Paris Conservatory, which inspired her to advocate for government funding of her school, as was done in France. On September 15, 1869, at the age of 19, she married Francis Beatty Thurber (Delhi, November 13, 1842 – Manhattan, July 4, 1907), who would later become a millionaire grocery wholesaler. The couple had two daughters, Marianne and Jeannette. The family had a summer home at Onteora Park in the Catskill Mountains.\\"F. B. Thurber Dead\\", obituary in The New York Times, July 5, 1907\\"W. E. Connor to Wed\\", The New York Times, April 24, 1913 The National Conservatory of Music of America building In 1884 Thurber sponsored New York City's first Wagner festival. In 1885 she founded the National Conservatory of Music of America and its adjunct American Opera Company, both in New York.\\"The Deal That Brought Dvořák to New York\\" by Michael Cooper, The New York Times, August 23, 2013 In 1888/89 she sponsored the New York debut of the Boston Symphony. But the Conservatory seemed to be her real love, and she grew it from 84 students when it opened to 3,000 students in 1900. Her success was due, in part, to her conviction that her school required an outstanding and publicly-celebrated faculty: its first director was Jacques Bouhy, a world- renowned baritone. In 1892, she was responsible for bringing the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák to the United States to head her conservatory, where he remained until 1895. Dvořák, who refused her offer several times, was ultimately persuaded by his wife, Anna Dvorak, when she learned of the staggering annual salary of $15,000, which was 25 times his current income. He was to receive four months' summer leave in exchange for three hours of daily teaching and six annual concerts. It was there that he met 26-year-old African-American student Harry Burleigh. Burleigh, who mopped floors to pay for his tuition, sang spirituals as he worked and drew the interest of Dvorak. Burleigh's rendering of African-American spirituals had a profound effect on Dvorak’s compositions and served as the basis for one of his best-known symphonies, (with a title suggested by Thurber, it’s said), “From the New World.” Dvorak said \\"In the Negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music. Burleigh went on to assist Dvorak in copying sections of his work as his amanuensis, and ultimately became a well-known baritone and composer in his own right, as well as a faculty member at the Conservatory. In addition to race and gender issues, Thurber championed the idea of a federally-funded Conservatory and was very pointed about the fact that the United States was the only industrialized nation that did not provide government monies for the arts. Thurber “precipitated public debate over the appropriateness of a federally funded Conservatory of music in a capitalist society.” In fact, the Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York, chartered in 1904 with the backing of Andrew Carnegie, was a privately funded institution and became her chief competition, and there’s no indication in the public record that they accepted blacks, the handicapped or even women. The school ultimately morphed into the Juilliard School. (Carnegie also was a founding patron of Thurber’s Conservatory though some research suggests that other than a small amount from L. Horton and Andrew Carnegie, Thurber is the only one who contributed financial backing.) Jeannette Meyers Thurber in her office Thurber’s continuing difficulties in securing funding for her school—either public or private—and her flagging energy as she grew older, contributed to the demise of the school, but her success did as well: music schools started springing up, competing for faculty and students. On the other hand, her school was written out of the record of musical history well before the doors had even closed. “It is conspicuously absent from Elson’s National Music of America, written in 1899, nor is there any reference to it in Waldo Selden Pratt’s 1909 History of Music, yet the school was still advertising nationally and enrolling hundreds of students.” Scholars suggest it could be because the school had been pigeon-holed as being “specifically successful in helping students of foreign birth and certain special classes, like the blind and those of Negro blood.\\" Or because the orchestra had a “a sprinkling of girls”, as the New York Evening Post reported in 1899. Thurber lived to be 96, passing away in 1946 as a woman who “combined her love of music with an entrepreneurial imagination, the management skills of the labor negotiator, and a profound dedication to music education—qualities that mark her, even to this day, as one of the most intelligent, effective patrons ever to take a stand for American music.” References * External links * *\\"View From Even Further East: The Importance of Being Europe\\" by Daniel Freisenfeld, NewMusicBox, November 1, 2003 *\\"In Conversation with Maurice Peress\\" by Molly Sheridan, NewMusicBox, July 8, 2005 *Jeannette Thurber's connection to Dvořák's Te Deum, Op. 103. *\\"Antonín Dvořák and the National Conservatory of Music\\" by Tali Makell, music director of the Chamber Philharmonia of New York Category:American philanthropists Category:Impresarios Category:American socialites Category:1850 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Women in classical music Category:19th-century American women Category:20th-century American women ","title":"Jeannette Thurber"},{"id":"1150481","text":"John Daniel Hicks (born June 2, 1962) is an American sportscaster for NBC Sports since 1992.

Acquisitions =Etak= In May 2000, Tele Atlas acquired Etak, Inc., a US- based vendor of automotive navigation system equipment, digital maps, and mapping software, from Sony Corporation, which became Tele Atlas North America. Etak, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate company soon after. =TomTom= On July 23, 2007, a €2 billion offer for the company by navigation system maker TomTom was accepted by the Tele Atlas board. This was then trumped by a €2.3 billion offer from United States-based rival Garmin on October 31, 2007 initiating a bidding war for Tele Atlas. TomTom responded by upping their bid to €2.9 billion, an offer which was again approved by the board of Tele Atlas. Garmin had been expected to counterbid once again: with Tele Atlas' main global rival Navteq subject to a takeover bid from Nokia, the company had stated that it did not wish both companies to fall into the hands of rivals. However, after striking a content agreement with Navteq through the year 2015, Garmin withdrew its takeover offer, clearing the way for TomTom. On December 4, 2007, TomTom shareholders approved the takeover. The European Commissioner for Competition cleared the takeover in May 2008, and it closed in June. Internet mapping agreements Historically, Internet mapping providers have utilized map data from a variety of vendors. Given the growth in usage of Internet mapping portals, the map suppliers have competed fiercely for that business. On 30 June 2008, Tele Atlas announced a five-year agreement to continue to supply data to Google Maps. Under the deal, Tele Atlas was to have access to corrections and updates to the data made by the Google Maps community. Roughly a year later, in October 2009, Google discontinued using Tele Atlas maps in the United States and began collecting map feedback from consumers for their own use. Shortly thereafter, Google announced Google Maps Navigation for Android, which provides turn-by-turn navigation, similar to the functionality provided by TomTom devices, for free as part of Android.

The first reference to a populated settlement in Caveira appeared in the works of António Cordeiro, published in 1717, citing the existence of a small place along the coast. From here Caveira evolved, becoming a primitive community dependent on the much larger administrative and religious village of Santa Cruz (whose parish included Caveira). Owing to the distance and difficulty in traveling from the valley of Ribeira da Cruz, in 1757, the parish vicar (Father Agostinho Pereira de Lacerda) requested that the bishop of Angra (at that time Brother Valério do Sacramento) annex Caveira to the neighboring parish of São Caetano da Lomba (even though it was part of the neighboring municipality). The situation did not improve communication or the betterment of the faith community connected to Lomba, and with the assistance of a local property-holder (José António de Sousa Bettencourt of Graciosa), a small chapel was constructed on the current site of the local cemetery. The chapel to the invocation of Benditas Almas (Blessed Souls), was 12 metres in length and 4.2 meters in width. Once completed, the parish priest José Joaquim de Almeida quickly petitioned that Caveira should be elevated to parish, going as far as a petition directly to King John VI of Portugal (dated December 19, 1823). The church remained the property of João António Bettencourt (a descendant) who maintained the building in a reasonable condition, but its condition degraded considerably. In a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta (in 1867), António José Vieira Santa Rita reported the lamentable condition of the sanctuary. The cornerstone of the new church was laid on June 13, 1870, but its completion was slow and difficult. Although supported by emigres to the United States and notable local residents, such as the Visconde da Silva Figueira, the main chapel wasn't completed until September 11, 1880. From this time the new church was named for Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although the Church in Angra refused to accept the change. In the beginning of the 20th century, rich in dairy resources, a local man (José Luís) began a local butter-producing business focused on the local Caveirense market. As the local population slowly shrank, the business was eventually integrated into the União das Cooperatives. =Legend of Caveira= The legend of how the village received its name During the 16th century, during the Age of Exploration, caravels frequently passed along Flores, on their voyages between Europe and the Americas. These ships were regularly buffeted by Atlantic storms and shipwrecked along the coast. It is said that a survivor of one of these storms, hungry, wet and cold, appeared along a windy and rugged part of the north-east coast, where he was given food, dry clothes and cared for by the local residents. The man, Demétrio, began to enjoy his life in the small village, married and remained there, where he became a popular with its residents. Although a good Christian man, he had many ideas that were considered heretical: for example, he exclaimed that prayers for the dead had no meaning and he negated the existence of Purgatory or Hell. Finally, although he believed in a soul, he believed that it resided in the blood, and that upon a human's death it separated from the body and transformed into a bird, until the body was cremated or degenerated into the soil. He also believed that the bird was the incarnation of Morana, the god of death, and that it sang while the body died, facilitating the soul's entrance into heaven. While his neighbours did not accept his ideas, he continued to live, educating his sons, and living in harmony with the residents of the village. After a few years, Demétrio, now an old man, after many years in bed with illness, died. At that moment a wagtail flew onto a faia tree close-by, but did not begin to sing as was expected. Demétrio was buried on top of a mountain, and his wife, influenced by her husband's faith, was a little preoccupied with the fact that the bird did not sing. After some time afterword there started to appear a skull (Portuguese: caveira) with an inner light, and the local residents believed that it was Demétrio's soul trying to obtain prayers in order to be delivered from Purgatory. Someone then decided to begin services and pray the rosary for God's intercession on behalf of the good, but heretical, Demétrio. After a short time, the bird began to sing and the skull stopped appearing. At the top of the rugged rock the family constructed a niche, with a panel representing the skull, but the name of the village began to referred to as Caveira.Ângela Furtado-Brum, 1999, p.278-279  Geography  =Physical geography= The small parish is located along a promontory divided by a couple of river-valleys: Ribeira da Cruz, in the north, which bisects the hamlet, and Ribeira da Silva, in the south, which separates the civil parish from Lomba, in the municipality of Lajes das Flores. In addition, the Ribeira do Moirato bisects the southern portion of the parish and joins the Ribeira da Silva to empty into the ocean along Fajã Pedro Vieira. The Caveira promontory is encircled by basaltic fractures and dominated by Ponta da Caveira, an area formed from large polychromatic basalts formations where the community is situated. The northern Ribeira da Cruz is an open escarpment and valley that extends towards the center of the island. Near the mouth of the Ribeira da Cruz is the large cliffs of Rocha Fernão Jorge, a semi-triangular physical feature formed from basaltic prisms originating from lava flows. It is a unique feature, similarly found in Antsiranana Bay, northern Madagascar. Along the coast is the Gruta dos Encharéus, a large cavern/fracture at the base of Ponta da Caveira (50 meters width, 25 meters long and 15 meters in depth) where boats may penetrate and dock. It was once used as a hideout for pirates, privateers and smugglers in the past, but is currently a tourist site. =Climate= The higher altitudes makes the parish susceptible to strong ocean winds. Heavy precipitation in this zone allows agriculture to thrive, and in particular the raising of dairy cattle. =Human geography= The catholic faith community is guided by Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although officially still holding onto the primitive Benditas Almas canonical titles. Its relative proximity to Santa Cruz has allowed the growth of secondary industries associated with activities in the municipal center. The parish also contains the locality Espigão. Economy The community is focused on agricultural production, and in particular dairy activities. As mentioned, João Luís, was the principal investor in the local butter industry in Caveira. In other communities on Flores, other businessmen concentrated on the single-market butter business; for example, Ponta Ruiva and Ponta Delgada had their own butter factories serving their own markets. These smaller communities did not participate in the Florense agricultural syndicate pioneered by José Furtado Mota at the time. This created tensions between consumers and producers, who remarked in a 1918 Açoreano Oriental article that residents of Santa Cruz were never supplied butter, even as 10,000 kilograms of butter were being exported. Local residents of this community were required to travel to any of the outlying communities in order to purchase butter, including Caveira. The gradual de-population of this community spelled the extinction of the private butter industry, as the União das Cooperatives swallowed-up smaller businesses.

The series premiered in 1994 on Bravo where it aired for 22 seasons and was hosted by James Lipton from its premiere until 2018. It is taped at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University's New York City campus. On April 2, 2019, it was announced that the show would move to Ovation with the 23rd season premiering on October 13, 2019. Along with producing a new season, Ovation acquired the rights to all previous seasons. With the new format, the show now uses a rotating panel of hosts. About the program James Lipton The program began as a televised craft seminar for students of the Actors Studio Drama School, originally a joint venture of the Actors Studio and New School University in 1994, with Paul Newman, a former Actors Studio president, as its first guest, and soon became Bravo's flagship program. At first taped at the New School's Tishman Auditorium in Greenwich Village, New York City, it was shifted subsequently to its present location, Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University's New York City campus. The program is presented as a seminar to students of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University. The show deliberately uses a slower pace in the interviews as compared with a typical celebrity interview, thus cameras usually record a couple of hours of conversation, later edited to one or two hours. The result, as a New York Times article expressed it, \\"In Mr. Lipton's guest chair, actors cease being stars for a while and become artists and teachers.\\" Though sometimes, some interviews go longer; Steven Spielberg's 1999 visit, for example, stretched to four hours, and was later shown as two episodes of one hour each. The interviews are guided by Lipton's trademark index-card questions, which sometimes reveal his well-researched knowledge of guests' lives, often startling some. On one such occasion, Billy Crystal told Lipton, \\"You know you're scary, don't you?\\" On another occasion, Martin Sheen asked Lipton, \\"How do you know all this? This is extraordinary.\\" And Sir Anthony Hopkins, upon learning that Lipton knew the exact address where the former had been born and raised in Wales, turned to the audience and remarked, \\"He's a detective, you know.\\" In May 2005, the contract between the Actors Studio and New School University was not renewed. Beginning with the 12th season, in the fall of 2005, the program was taped at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University's New York City campus. The show featured a new set with a gritty backstage feel, designed by Will Rothfuss for Blair Broadcast Designs, and The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University re-opened in new facilities. James Lipton with guest Angelina Jolie. The majority of the show is held as a one-on-one interview. Since its premiere, Inside the Actors Studio has had over 300 guests. The first episode's guest was Paul Newman (Alec Baldwin was the first guest, but his interview was broadcast after Newman's). The guests have included 74 Academy Award winners: eight directors; four screenwriters; 61 actors and actresses; and three composers. For its 200th show, Lipton became the guest subject of the show. He was questioned by Dave Chappelle, whom he picked personally. The show ended with the Pace University provost announcing that the college is sponsoring a scholarship in Chappelle's name to his high school alma mater. Based on the show, James Lipton published a book titled Inside Inside in 2007. In September 2018, Lipton declared that he was stepping down from the program after 23 seasons. Starting in 2019, the show is hosted by different celebrities. In his review of the program, The Sunday Times critic A.A. Gill wrote: \\"The format is simple and idiotically inspired. The Actors Studio is the New York drama school made famous by Stanislavsky and his method (although the series is now filmed elsewhere). These shows are thinly set-up masterclasses for students. The cleverness is in the vanity it allows the guests, who are the very greatest and most self-regarding performers and creators of theatre and film. People who are too grand to talk to anyone will talk to Inside the Actors Studio. They believe they're giving something back, offering precious pearls of insight to a new generation. And who doesn't look good passing it on to adoring students? In truth, it's just a chat show on satellite, but the veil of education and posterity is held decorously high, so everybody turns up and talks with a smile.\\"http://entertainment...icle7048349.ece While most of the show is a one-on-one interview conducted by the host (Lipton in the first 22 seasons, rotating hosts since season 23), this is followed by the host submitting a questionnaire to the guest. The questionnaire concept was originated by French television personality Bernard Pivot on his show Apostrophes, after the Proust Questionnaire. The 10 questions Lipton asks are: #What is your favorite word? #What is your least favorite word? #What turns you on? #What turns you off? #What sound or noise do you love? #What sound or noise do you hate? #What is your favorite curse word? #What profession other than your own would you like to attempt? #What profession would you not like to do? #If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates? The program usually concludes with a question-and-answer session with the students. In France, the show has been broadcast since 1999 on Paris Première, with French subtitles. In popular culture The show has been good-naturedly lampooned for Lipton's paused and somewhat clipped delivery on Saturday Night Live, in which Will Ferrell portrayed Lipton interviewing himself as an annoyed guest. He was also spoofed on The Simpsons, where character Rainier Wolfcastle (a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger) shoots his interviewer and a dying Lipton croaks, \\"It has been both an honor and a privilege to eat your lead, sir.\\" In another episode of The Simpsons, in which Homer donates a kidney, he single-mindedly rushes his family home so he can watch the Inside The Actors Studio interview of F. Murray Abraham. Ferrell, with his Old School co-stars Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and director Todd Phillips, again portrayed a satirical version of Lipton in a skit called \\"Inside the Actors Studio Spoof\\", which can be seen as part of the DVD release special features for the film. Ferrell appears as himself and answers questions poking fun at some of his less successful films, such as A Night at the Roxbury, in what is obviously a comedic take on Lipton's sometimes overly reverential approach to his interviewees. Comedian Will Sasso portrayed him on Mad TV and David Cross parodied him as Cyrus on Mr Show. Weird Al Yankovic's song \\"Couch Potato\\" describes \\"James Lipton discussing the oeuvre of Mr. Rob Schneider.\\" among other things on TV.

After college Langewiesche moved to New York City and went to work as a writer for Flying, a large-circulation publication for general aviation pilots. While there he wrote technical reports on the flight characteristics of various airplanes, and profiles of people. In his mid-twenties, he quit the job in order to write books—one non-fiction, and two novels—none of which was published. He continued to travel and write, supporting himself by flying airplanes. The travels eventually took Langewiesche to the most remote parts of the Sahara desert and sub-Saharan West Africa. This became the subject of a cover story for The Atlantic Monthly, in 1991, and later of a book titled Sahara Unveiled. The Atlantic sent Langewiesche to many parts of the world and increasingly into conflict zones.

In the story, an ape named Red Peter, who has learned to behave like a human, presents to an academy the story of how he effected his transformation. The story was first published by Martin Buber in the German monthly Der Jude, along with another of Kafka's stories, \\"Jackals and Arabs\\" (\\"Schakale und Araber\\"). The story appeared again in a 1919 collection titled Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor). Plot The narrator, speaking before a scientific conference, describes his former life as an ape. His story begins in a West African jungle, in which a hunting expedition shoots and captures him. Caged on a ship for his voyage to Europe, he finds himself for the first time without the freedom to move as he will. Needing to escape from this situation, he studies the habits of the crew, and imitates them with surprising ease; he reports encountering particular difficulty only in learning to drink alcohol. Throughout the story, the narrator reiterates that he learned his human behavior not out of any desire to be human, but only to provide himself with a means of escape from his cage. Upon arriving in Europe, the ape realizes that he is faced with a choice between \\"the Zoological Garden or the Music Hall,\\" and devotes himself to becoming human enough to become an able performer. He accomplishes this, with the help of many teachers, and reports to the academy that his transformation is so complete that he can no longer properly describe his emotions and experiences as an ape. In concluding, the ape expresses a degree of satisfaction with his lot. Translated by Ian Johnston. Analysis Walter Herbert Sokel has suggested that the story speaks to a conflict \\"between internal and external continuity in the ape's existence\\".Sokel, Walter Herbert. The Myth of Power and the Self: Essays on Franz Kafka. 2002, page 169. The preservation of the life of the protagonist is dependent upon his casting off memory and identity; only by achieving the end of that internal identity could actual biological life be maintained. Thus, for the ape, \\"identity is performance\\"; \\"It is not a static essence, a given, but a constantly reenacted self-representation.\\"Sokel, Walter Herbert. The Myth of Power and the Self: Essays on Franz Kafka. 2002, page 283. The motif of the changeability of identity may have ramifications in the context of Zionism and the Jewish diaspora, as \\"A Report to an Academy\\" first appeared in a Zionist magazine. Nicholas Murray briefly suggests in his 2004 biography of Kafka that the story is a satirization of Jews' assimilation into Western culture. The story's references to the protagonist's \\"apish past\\" (\\"äffisches Vorleben\\") have led some literary theorists to associate the story with evolutionary theory.Martens, Lorna. Shadow Lines: Austrian Literature from Freud to Kafka. 1991, page 263. In J.M. Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello, the title character gives a central place to \\"A Report to an Academy\\" in her speech about vegetarianism and animal rights. She also suggests that Kafka may have been influenced by German psychologist Wolfgang Köhler's The Mentality of Apes, also published in 1917. However, historian Gregory Radick suggests that a more likely inspiration for Kafka was the work of the American psychologist Lightner Witmer. In 1909 Witmer staged a widely publicized test of the mental abilities of a vaudeville chimp named Peter. This test, conducted in front of a panel of scientists, included a demonstration of Peter's ability to say several words, including \\"momma.\\" Adaptations Mexican actor Humberto Dupeyron has performed this play under the title \\"The Gorilla\\". In 1987 South African actor Marius Weyers performed an adaptation to rave reviews in Los Angeles. Critics noted the parallels with apartheid race science.https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-15/entertainment/ca-29054_1_marius- weyers In 1989 the monologuist and writer Andrew Tansey adapted and premiered The Greatest Ape, an adaptation of Kafka's story, at the Edinburgh International Festival, before touring the USA and UK. The critically acclaimed production was directed by Paul Dodwell. In 2009, a theatrical adaptation of Kafka's story by Colin Teevan opened at the Young Vic in London. The hour-long solo piece was directed by Walter Meierjohann, and Kathryn Hunter's performance as Red Peter the ape was widely acclaimed. In 2013 the play was set up at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. The 2001 film Human Nature, written by Charlie Kaufman, is a loose adaptation of Kafka's short story. In 2013, the short story was staged in Montreal under the name of Kafka's Ape, presented by independent theater company Infinitheatre. Guy Sprung directed actor Howard Rosenstein in the role of Red Peter. In the 2014 story collection Only the Animals by Ceridwen Dovey, the short story Red Peter's Little Lady (Soul of Chimpanzee) uses A Report to an Academy as the jumping off point for her tale of a dead chimpanzee who recounts his experiences as an animal trained to act human.

The first black composer instrumental in developing characteristically American music, Burleigh made black music available to classically trained artists both by introducing them to spirituals and by arranging them in a more classical form.  Early and family life  Henry Thacker Burleigh was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1866 to Henry Thacker and Elizabeth Burleigh. His grandfather, Hamilton Waters, was granted manumission from slavery in Somerset County, Maryland, after paying $55 ($50 for himself and $5 for his mother) in 1832 and receiving a certificate of freedom in 1835. They traveled to Ithaca, New York, where two of Waters' half-brothers lived. After his mother died, Waters married Lucinda Duncanson. Their first child, Elizabeth Lovey Waters (who would be Burleigh's mother) was born in Lansing, New York, in 1838. Later that year the family moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where they lived until the 1920s. Elizabeth, who graduated from Avery College in Pittsburgh in 1855, was denied a teaching position in the Erie Public Schools, but taught at the Colored School for many years. Burleigh's father, Henry Thacker Burleigh, Sr., a naval veteran in the Civil War, was the first black juror in Erie County in 1871. After his father's death in 1873, his mother remarried in 1875. Her second husband, John Elmendorf, was also a veteran of the Union Navy. Burleigh's grandfather, who was known for his \\"exceptionally melodious voice,\\" taught young Burleigh and his brother Reginald traditional spirituals and slave songs. Burleigh helped support his family by various odd jobs: lighting gas streetlamps, selling newspapers and working as a printer's devil, working as a coachman, and as a steward on Lake Erie steamboats. He also studied to be an accountant at the Clark's Business College while he was in high school. His mother occasionally worked as a maid for the daughter of Burleigh Sr.'s employer when she held musicales (musical gatherings) in her home. Burleigh served as a doorman when various famous musicians performed at those musicales, including Venezuelan pianist Teresa Carreño and Italian tenor Italo Campanini. Burleigh studied voice with George F. Brierly, and during and after his high school years became known as one of Erie's most accomplished classical singers. Several Erie churches and the Jewish synagogue hired him as a soloist, and he also sang as soloist at many community and civic events.Jean E. Snyder. Harry T. Burleigh: From the Spiritual to the Harlem Renaissance. Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2016.  Studies at the National Conservatory  Burleigh was accepted, with a scholarship, to the prestigious National Conservatory of Music in New York at the age of 26. He obtained the scholarship with the help of Frances MacDowell, the mother of composer Edward MacDowell, and would eventually play double bass in the Conservatory's orchestra. Though at first the Conservatory denied Burleigh entrance, citing low grades, Mrs. MacDowell (the registrar) insisted that he try his entrance exam again. Days later, he received a scholarship. = Relation with Dvořák = To help support himself during his studies, Burleigh worked for Mrs. MacDowell as a handyman, cleaning and working on anything she needed. Reputedly, Burleigh, who later became known worldwide for his excellent baritone voice, sang spirituals while cleaning the Conservatory's halls, which drew the attention of the conservatory's director, Czech composer Antonín Dvořák, who asked Burleigh to sing for him. Burleigh said: \\"I sang our Negro songs for him very often, and before he wrote his own themes, he filled himself with the spirit of the old Spirituals.\\"Jean E. Snyder, \\"A great and noble school of music: Dvořák, Harry T. Burleigh, and the African American Spiritual\\". In Tibbetts, John C. (ed.), Dvořák in America: 1892–1895, Portland, OR: Amadeus Press, 1993, p. 131. Dvořák said: \\"In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.\\"Interviewed by James Creelman, New York Herald, May 21, 1893. From what he called \\"Negro melodies\\" and Native American music, Dvořák took up the Pentatonic scale, which appears in some places in his Symphony \\"From the New World\\" and at the beginning of each movement of the \\"American\\" String Quartet. In the Symphony, a flute theme resembles the spiritual \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,\\" which may well be among those Burleigh sang to Dvořák. Major pentatonic scale - F - Treble Minor pentatonic scale - D - Treble Clef Dvorak Quartet op96 - 1st movement - Viola theme Dvorak Quartet op96 - 2nd movement - Main theme Dvorak Quartet op96 - mvt 3 - Main Theme Dvorak Quartet op96 - mvt 4 - main theme In 1922, another student of Dvořák, William Arms Fisher, wrote the spiritual-like song \\"Goin' Home\\" based on an English horn melody from the second movement (Largo) of the Symphony. No evidence seems to exist that the song existed before 1922, or the melody before the Symphony (1893), although both are disputed; see also the Talk page of the Symphony. In 1893 Burleigh assisted Dvořák in copying out instrumental parts for the symphony. The following year, Burleigh sang in Dvořák's arrangement of Pennsylvania native Stephen C. Foster's classic Old Folks at Home. He graduated in 1896, and later served on the conservatory's faculty.  Singing career  Burleigh began his singing career as the baritone in his family's quartet. By the time Burleigh left Erie in January 1892, he was singing with the city's best vocalists at civic events and church gatherings. At the end of the summer of 1892, Burleigh gave a performance in the Adirondacks, at North Hudson, New York, as the featured soloist in \\"the summer school for Christian workers.\\" Nine months after arriving in New York City, Burleigh appeared in two Grand Encampment Concerts at the Metropolitan Church in Washington, D.C., as \\"the celebrated Western baritone.\\" In 1894, he became a soloist for St. George's Episcopal church in New York City. Some parishioners opposed hiring Burleigh at the all- white church, because of his race, at a time when other white New York Episcopal churches were forbidding black people to worship. J. P. Morgan, a member of St. George's at that time, cast the deciding vote to hire Burleigh. In spite of the initial problems obtaining the appointment, Burleigh became close to many members during his long tenure as a soloist at the church. He retired from this position after 52 years in 1946. He was instrumental in starting its tradition of an annual Spirituals service every May (1924–55). His singing \\"The Palms\\" by Jean-Baptiste Faure was a Palm Sunday tradition for 50 years, and New York Mayor La Guardia arranged a radio broadcast from his office in 1944. In the late 1890s, Burleigh gained a reputation as a concert soloist, singing art songs and opera selections, as well as African-American folk songs. He sang before King Edward VII in London in 1908, among other prestigious European concerts. From 1900 to 1925, Burleigh was also a member of the synagogue choir at the Temple Emanu-El in New York, the only African- American to sing there. He also frequently worked with Walter F. Craig and his orchestra.Snyder 2016, p. 155. Hayes, Brown, Tapley & Burleigh from a 1915 Boston performance Burleigh disdained recording and it was long (mistakenly) believed that no recording existed of his voice. He recorded once in 1919, for a small label run by his friend George Broome, and again in 1944 for St. George's church. The 1919 recording exists, but the latter recordings have never been found.Brooks, Tim, Lost Sounds: Blacks and the Birth of the Recording Industry, 1890–1919, 473–485, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2004. The 1919 recording, \\"Go Down, Moses\\", is on the CD Lost Sounds, Archeophone ARCH 1005.  Arrangements and compositions  In the late 1890s, Burleigh also began to publish his own arrangements of art songs. About 1898 he began to compose his own songs and by the late 1910s, Burleigh was one of America's best-known composers of art songs. Beginning around 1910, Burleigh also worked editing music for G. Ricordi, an Italian music publisher with offices in New York. Burleigh published several versions of the Negro spiritual \\"Deep River\\" in 1916 and 1917, and quickly became known for his arrangements of spirituals for voice and piano. One of his arrangements in Common Metre is the hymn tune \\"McKee\\", used with John Oxenham's hymn \\"In Christ There Is No East or West\\".http://www.oremus.org/hymnal/i/i1236.html Retrieved December 11, 2011. His arrangements helped to make spirituals a popular genre for concert singers, and within a few years, many notable singers performed Burleigh's arrangements. Burleigh's art song arrangements of spirituals and sentimental songs were so popular during the late 1910s and 1920s, that almost no vocal recitalist gave a concert in a major city without occasionally singing them. John McCormack sang several of Burleigh's songs in concert, including \\"Little Mother of Mine\\" (1917), \\"Dear Old Pal of Mine\\" (1918), \\"Under a Blazing Star\\" (1918), and \\"In the Great Somewhere\\" (1919). The popularity of Burleigh's settings contributed to an explosion of popularity for the genre during the 1920s. He also set some poems by Walt Whitman to music, and also published music for piano and violin. Estimates of Burleigh's original musical output range from 200 to 300 songs. In 1914, he was a founding member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and received a seat on its board of directors in 1941.  Death and legacy  Through the 1920s and 1930s, Burleigh continued to promote especially the spirituals through publications, lectures, and arrangements. His lifelong advocacy for the spiritual eclipsed his singing career, as well as his arrangements of art songs. He retired in 1946 because of ill health, and his son moved him from Long Island to a retirement home in Stamford, Connecticut, where he died aged 82 from heart failure on September 12, 1949.Afrocentric Voices: H.T. Burleigh Biography. More than 2000 people attended his funeral at St. George's. Pallbearers included Hall Johnson, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, William C. Handy, and Cameron White.\\"H. T. Burleigh (1866–1949)\\" (biography), Library of Congress.\\"Harry Burleigh, A Dedicated Gospel Performer\\" , African American Registry. His remains were returned for burial in Erie, Pennsylvania.GoErie With the success of Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson, and Paul Robeson, among others, many of whom he had coached, Burleigh's seminal role in establishing African-American soloists on America's recital stages seemed eclipsed. His many popular art songs from the early 20th century have often been out of print since the composer's death. Nevertheless, he remains one of America's most important composers from the early 20th century. In 1917, Burleigh received the Spingarn Medal, which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awards annually for outstanding achievement by an African American. He also received honorary degrees from Howard University and Atlanta University. Nobody Knows: Songs of Harry T. Burleigh, an album of his works by Karen Parks (co-produced by Parks and Grammy-winning producer David Macias), debuted at No. 2 on Billboard′s Traditional Classical Album Chart upon its 2008 release. Burleigh is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on September 11. Also, works he edited or transposed continue in the 1982 Hymnal, including No. 529 (\\"In Christ there is no East or West\\"). Other arrangements are included in the alternative hymnals, including Lift Every Voice and Sing.

This ranks it as one of the leading English newspapers in West Bengal, India.About Statesman. Subir Bhaumik. History The Statesman is a direct descendant of two newspapers, the Bombay (now Mumbai) based Indian Statesman and The Friend of India published in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Indian Statesman was started by Robert Knight, who was previously the principal founder and editor of The Times of India. Knight merged the two papers to The Statesman and New Friend of India on 15 January 1875.Griffiths, D. (ed.): The Encyclopedia of the British Press 1422–1992.Hirschmann, E. (2004).

It absorbed its erstwhile rival The Englishman in 1927.Hirschmann, E. (2004). The Hidden Roots of a Great Newspaper: Calcutta’s ‘Statesman’. Victorian Periodicals Review, 37(2), 141–160. JSTOR. The Statesman was managed by a British corporate group until it transferred ownership to a consortium of companies with N A Palkhivala as Chairman in the mid-1960s. The first editor assigned under this new ownership was Pran Chopra. Editorial style Statesman House, Kolkata The Statesman is characterized by its terse reporting style. It holds an Centre-Right position. It opposed the shifting of India's capital from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1911, stating that \\"[t]he British have gone to the city of graveyards to be buried there\\". It also strenuously opposed Indira Gandhi's Emergency in 1975–77. Under the editor Ian Stephens (who was editor from 1942 to 1951), the newspaper published highly disturbing images, on 22 and 29 August 1943, of the effects of the Bengal famine of 1943, despite the British colonial government's attempts at censorship. The images played a major role in changing world opinion on imperialism. The Statesman Award for Rural Reporting is presented to outstanding journalists every year, irrespective of affiliation, to further the social uplifting of indigents from India. The awards are presented on 16 September every year, the death anniversary of Justice Sudhi Ranjan Das, former Chief Justice of India's Supreme Court and chairman of The Statesman during the tumultuous Emergency years. Once the most widely read English dailies in West Bengal, The Statesman has now lost some ground to The Telegraph, The Times of India and Hindustan Times in the state. But it is widely regarded as the paper to read for serious news reportage, incisive analytical articles and usage of standard English language. The Statesman is a founding member of the Asia News Network, a grouping of 22 Asian newspapers that have joined hands for a daily news exchange. This allows The Statesman to offer exhaustive coverage of all Asian regions.

Although Cedros was considered a \\"breadbasket\\" of the region, it had an important place in the economy of the island for the abundance of the Azorean cedar (cedros-do-mato) because its lumber was used in the construction of ships for fishing, for the early homes and the implements used in agriculture. The fibers of the cedars were usually dried in the sun, and used to produce twine or ropes. But, Ilhéu Furado and the anchorage of Alagoa was, during many decades, the natural access to the island of Flores when winds from the southeast were strong. Alagoa was the heart of Cedros, due to its access to the sea, and connection to the interior pasturelands and orchards. The distance between Cedros and Ponta Ruivo from their respective parishes, at the time, the mountainous cliffs and valleys and climate, made the residents petition the Bishop of Angra, at the time Friar Clement Vieira, to de-annex their localities from their respective parishes. By doing so, the residents would constitute their own parish and construct a church, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, at their own cost. The Captain-major at the time, D. Martinho de Mascarenhas (sixth Count of Santa Cruz) also supported the claims of the citizens, and offered to build a chapel and to donate a statue of Senhora do Pilar. After bishop António Álvares Pereira de Sousa visited the community in 1690, and after having agreed to elevate the community to parish he died, and the decision was delayed. Finally, Cedros, Ponta Ruiva and possibly Alagoa, were elevated to parish on July 9, 1693, a community of 176 inhabitants in 50 homes. Father Domingos Furtado de Mendonça was its first parish priest, he had an annual pay of about 24$000 réis, two parts in wheat and one in cash, of which he paid a portion to the Count of Sant Cruz. Faithful to their promise the residents constructed a new church, that was completed in 1693, and which the Count complied in donating the new chapel, whose addition was completed in 1719. Inscriptions on two rocks found during demolition on the church in September 1945 confirm these facts, as well as a shield of D. Martinho de Mascarenhas and cross etched with 1693 and 1719, respectively. The church was reconstructed in 1822, but by 1868 a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta, at that time António José Vieira Santa Rita, considered the building to be in a bad state of conservation. Until the 20th century it was common for many Cedrenses, much like most poor in the Azores, to travel shoeless, and brought their shoes, ties and some clothing in a satchel when traveling to the \\"cosmopolitan\\" community of Santa Cruz. Ironically, the community had a distinction for being the population with the lowest level of illiteracy on the island of Flores: a fact that was attributed to professor Fraga (their local school teacher), who died in 1929. After the demolition of the insecure old church in September 1945, the cornerstone of the new church was planted on January 22, 1950, thanks to the efforts of its parish priest, Father José Maria Álvares, receiving its consecration on June 18, 1953. Until 1966, when the French military base was constructed, there was no formal road connecting Cedros with Ponta Delgada. At that time, Cedros became the terminus of the road network from the south (ending at Ponta Ruiva), and Ponta Delgada was only accessible by trail or by sea (as the weather permitted). Geography =Physical geography= The parish is delimited by the deep river-valley of Alagoa in the south, and Ribeira dos Cedros to the north (which separates Cedros from the parish of Ponta Delgada). Much like the parish of the same name on Faial, the settlement was given its name for the abundance of cedar trees (cedros-do-mato, or in Latin, Juniperus brevifolia), which its woods were used by the colonists for buildings during settlement in the 16th century. In fact, the availability of this wood allowed the growth of the community, which was located in a relatively isolated promontory along the coast. Gaspar Frutuoso, noted: \\"...there is a high cliff, projecting into the ocean, dressed in trees of cedar, laurel and white wood, it's [an area] populated by many of the Captain's wild goats [and whom]...living above are three or four neighbors...this is the area we call Cedros, for there are many there\\". Two sheltered bays also guard the coast of Cedros: along the coast of the valley of Alagoa (where there are several islets), and in front of Ponta Ruiva, where a small port was located. The small rocky islets (of which Fragata, Garajau, Carneiros and the islet of Álvaro Rodrigues) are all rocky, shallow features; apart from the islet of Álvaro Rodrigues, which was cultivated until about the middle of the 20th century, the islets are uninhabitable and lack sources of water. =Ecoregions/Protected areas= * Park of Alagoa () - located near an uninhabited settlement, it is a natural extension of the Ribeira da Alagoa, the ravine and valley that divides the coast; * Nature Reserve of Alagoa Bay Islets and Baixa do Moinho (), a site of communitarian interest, that includes an area of around the islets of Alagoa, for the protection of marine flora and fauna, and especially for population of roseate and common terns. It is part of the larger Sítio de Importância Comunitária (SIC) Costa Nordeste (Northern Coastal Site of Communitarian Interest) management plan, that includes an area with specific restrictions on what uses (including fishing and tourism) and environmental restrictions;UAç/DOP (2004) * There are several lookouts/belvederes within the limits of Cedros that add to scenic nature of the community: Miradouro dos Caimbros, Miradouro do Poço Comprido, Miradouro da Rocha da Gata and the Miradouro da Tapada Nova. =Human geography= The development of this area is unique in the Azores (owing to the higher altitudes and the prominence of strong winds) resulting in very isolated communities, that now have become linked by the roadways. Consequently, the parish has developed into three localities: * Cedros, the center of the parish, location of the parochial church, its small school (now closed as children are bused to the vila of Ponta Delgada); * Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet situated five kilometers northeast of Cedros on a high promontory by the sea; * Alagoa, a site along the deep valley of Ribeira da Alagoa, about south of Cedros, with few permanent residents, that was once the location of a small fort used for the defense of the coast from attacks by pirates or privateers. Economy The parish maintains its traditional rural character; the majority of its inhabitants are involved in agriculture, principally the raising of cattle, although some carpentry and commercial activities occur in this zone. Milling was also important, resulting in the construction of several mills along the Ribeira das Barrosas and Ribeira da Alagoa. Also, due to a micro-climate in the area of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare to the rest of the island), where oblong apples (similar to pears in shape) were grown. The small port of Alagoa, for many decades, was the point of embarkation for orange exports from the valley; an example of a successes in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships. Architecture =Civic= * Alagoa, the uninhabited community, but not in a state of ruins, notable for several architectural important buildings used during the early history of the community, including mills and a main bridge constructed in the 15th century; * Decorated Stone Rua da Igreja (); * Haylofts of Fajã dos Cedros (); * Haylofts of Rua da Esperança (); * Kiln of Cedros (); * Kiln of Fajã dos Cedros () * Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet, architecturally similar to homes built in Vila do Corvo; * Residence Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas () * Watermills of Ribeira dos Moinhos () =Military= * Artillery Battery of Alagoa (), located in a dominant position overlooking the Bay of Alagoa, it was constructed during a period of Cedros' history when raids by pirates occurred frequently =Religious= * Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar () * Império of the Divine Holy Spirit de Cima (), constructed in 1856, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts * Império of the Divine Holy Spirit de Baixo (), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts * * Império of the Divine Holy Spirit of Ponta Ruiva (), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts Culture =Festivities= The parish realizes its principal festival in honor of Nossa Senhora do Pilar and São Roque on the third Sunday of August. It also follows the tradition of the festivals of the Holy Spirit which are common in the islands of the Azores, here celebrated on the Sunday of Pentecosts. =Tradition= Faithful to tradition, there are still some who are involved in the handicraft industry reproducing in miniature implements used in the agriculture, for sale to tourists.

The family was first described in 1809 by Johann Hoffmansegg and Johann Link. In 1896, Robert Chodat split it into 3 tribes. A fourth tribe was split off from the tribe Polygaleae in 1992. Under the Cronquist classification system, Polygalaceae were treated in a separate order of their own, Polygalales. Currently, according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, the family belongs in Fabales. Description Polygalaceae are annual or perennial herbs, shrubs, shrublets, and small trees. Its zygomorphic, hermaphrodite, bisexual flowers have 3-5 petals and 5 sepals. Its leaves are usually alternate, but may be opposite, fascicled, or verticillate. Each flower usually contains 8 stamens, though this may range from 3 to 10\\\\. They are usually in 2 series. The fruits of each plant can be a capsule, samara, or drupe.

The population in 2011 was 359,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 17.65 km².Eurostat It is situated along the northern coast from the regional capital. It is the third oldest religious parish on the island of Flores, only preceded by the communities of Lajes and Santa Cruz das Flores. History Parochial Church of São Pedro, rebuilt from funds donated by Father Francisco de Fraga e AlmeidaThe religious parish of São Pedro da Ponta Delgada was one of the first three religious parishes on the island of Flores. The historical chronicler, Father Gaspar Frutuoso, stated that, at the end of the 16th century, Ponta Delgada was a small population of thirty neighbors and one chapel. A century later, Friar Agostinho de Montalverne referred to 650 inhabitants occupying 140 homes: essentially claiming it was the largest population on the island. Diogo das Chagas first placed the colonization of this area at about 1571, attaining the position of parish immediately. It included the area from Ribeira Funda until Ribeira das Casas, as well as Ponta Ruiva (now in Cedros and Ponta da Fajã (now part of Fajã Grande in the neighbouring municipality). Father António Cordeiro referred to a community of 150 homes and several roads leading to the ocean. The fertility of the land and access to potable water greatly assisted this growth. As Frutuoso noted, a primitive parish chapel was erected to the invocation of Santa Ana, but had long since \\"disappeared\\". The church of São Pedro was erected in 1763 near a small chapel, with the same name, at the end of the 17th century. In addition to São Pedro, the chapel of Santo Amaro (which co-existed in the parish, since the end of the 17th century) was the centre of popular festivals and testified to the community's dynamic nature: São Pedro, the protector of fishermen and Santo Amaro, protector of animals. The chapel of Santo Amaro was located near the old centre of the village near a grotto and spring. But, over time, the inhabitants decided to move the town centre away from the exposure to local northern wind currents. The principal promoter of a project to re-build the Church of São Pedro was Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida, a man of immense wealth and former-Vicar of Flores and Corvo Islands. His final testament bequeathed 100$000 réis to the Confraria de São Pedro (English: Confraternity of Saint Peter) to celebrate a mass in his name on the day of the inauguration of the new temple. It is not clear when that finally occurred, but documents show that in 1774 the builders were still working on the altars of the Church. This church was restored twice more (in 1971 and 1975), both times maintaining the interior and original foundations. On August 13, 1978 a new chapel was consecrated to the invocation of São João Baptista on Pico do Meio Dia near the site of a concrete cross that was consecrated on September 27, 1970. This new chapel gave rise to annual festivals celebrated every September. Geography Panorama of Ponta Delgada das Flores, as seen from Pico do Meio Dia The Maria Vaz Islet, as seen from the area around Albernaz Point Lighthouse The community is located on the northern coast of Flores Island, on a flat rock-bed that extends into the Atlantic Ocean, across from the island of Corvo (Flores' nearest neighbour). On either coast of the village are two islets, Maria Vaz (on the west coast) and João Martins, both named after important settlers during early colonization. Writing at the beginning of the 19th century, Father José António Camões described the villages place, as follows: :...passing the Furnal point you travel northeast to the port of Ponta Delgada. There is there, at the foot of the ocean, a sweet water spring that serves a great many of the inhabitants of that parish. There is a port...without fortifications...but with a cliff that is protective. Continuing north-east begins the great bay of Ponta Delgada, falling to this ocean is the Ribeira da Fazenda...and within the parish a port, called Portinho, where only with good humour can you unload your boats. There is a guard house. Outside the small port are two islets, called the islets of Portinho...continuing along the same wind trajectory there is a point called Ponta do Ilhéu. The area today is connected to Santa Cruz das Flores by a coastal road system that also crosses the interior of the island. The first automobile reached the parish in 1966: one of the last places on the island to be reached by road vehicles. Until then, transit to the north was made by horse-drawn carriage, by horse or mule, foot or by boat access from the south (when the weather permitted). As a consequence of modern emigration to the United States and Canada, and recently to the larger centre in Santa Cruz das Flores, the population has been in steady decline; in 1814 forty births were registered in the parish, but by the 1980s between two and six births were recorded. =Ecoregions/Protected areas= There are a few lookouts that provide tourists with notable vistas of Ponta Delgada, including Miradouro do Pico do Meio-Dia, Miradouro do Alto do Portalinho and Miradouro do Porto and Miradouro do Facho. In addition Ponta Delgada is bisected by approximately seven pedestrian hiking trails, within the community and with other parishes. =Natural Features= * Ponta do Albernaz, natural rock cliffs located in the western portion of Ponta Delgada, location of the lighthouse * Ilhéu da Maria Vaz, named for one of the original settlers of Flores, a small pyramidal islet in the bay of Ponta Delgada along its western coast. * Ilhéus do João Martins, named for another settler, and located off the northern coast of Ponta Delgada. * Pico do Meio Dia, location of the Chapel of São João Baptista, overlooking the southern part of Ponta Delgada * Quebrada Nova dos Fenais, a fajã along the southwest limits of parish accessible by pedestrian trail. * Ponta dos Ilhéus, an isthmus cliff on the southeast limit of the parish site of several mills constructed during settlement, now mostly in ruins.  Economy  The parish's principal activities are farming and animal husbandry (dairy and cattle ranching primarily), focusing on dairy production, as well as subsistence fishing and a small commercial nucleus. The port has had remodeling and modernization to permit both an increase in commercial traffic between Ponta Delgada, Vila do Corvo (Corvo Island) and the rest of the archipelago, as well as to capture lucrative trans-Atlantic maritime tourism.

In particular: it is the location of the regions Casa do Povo (literally the house of the people) and its ethnographic folklore group the Grupo Folclórico da Casa do Povo, a modern festival hall, the residence of the Grupo de Música Popular Vozes do Norte, and their football club Clube Desportivo de Ponta Delgada. =Festivities= The parish's principal festival is the Festa de São Pedro (Festival of Saint Peter) celebrated annually on June 29, as well as the Festa do Santo Amaro ('Festival of Saint Maurus), on the first Sunday of September. In addition, the Festa do São João (Festival of Saint John) on the second Sunday of July and the festival Nossa Senhora da Guia (Our Lady of the Guide) are also important religious events. Ultimately, the celebrations associated with the Holy Spirit, centered around the Sunday of Pentecost are the highlight of the religious calendar.

The Mayflower Steps are close to the site in the Barbican area of Plymouth, south-west England, from which the Pilgrim Fathers are believed to have finally left England aboard the Mayflower on 6 September 1620, before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to settle in North America. The traditional site of their disembarkation in North America is Plymouth Rock. The passengers who came predominantly from East Anglia sought religious and other freedoms. They had no links with Plymouth, but because of bad weather in the English Channel they were forced to put in at Plymouth seeking shelter and essential repairs. Several surviving local buildings including what is now the Plymouth Gin Distillery in Southside Street and the Island House on the Quay are claimed to have accommodated some of them for one or more nights. The 'Steps' today consist of a commemorative portico with Doric columns of Portland stone that was built in 1934, and a small platform over the water with a brushed steel rail and a shelf with some nautical bronze artwork and historical information. It is on a small pier that was built about a century ago or possibly in 18th century no one is definitely sure, when some very old houses that were blocking construction of a road around the seaward side of the Citadel leading to the Hoe were cleared together with the significant Watch House.

The alternate route in Seminole County was going to be a bypass of Sanford, but construction of SR 400 (Interstate 4) relegated it to a minor road, and it became CR 15 in the 1980s. The main route has stayed mostly the same. Here are the places where the route now differs: * The south end of SR 15 has stayed the same, but SR 80 has moved to the north, and thus the first three miles (5 km) of SR 15 is also SR 80. * SR 15 is now CR 15 in Osceola County and Orange County from SR 500 in Ashton to SR 528 east of Orlando International Airport. * SR 15 originally went from Conway to Orlando along Conway Road, but then turned west at Curry Ford Road and used Briercliff Drive, Delaney Avenue, and Gore Street to reach SR 527. The part of the old alignment on Curry Ford Road became part of SR 526A when SR 15 was moved. * Until around 1975, when the Mills Avenue Extension was built, SR 15 continued west from Mills Avenue along what is now SR 5098, and then went north on SR 527 through downtown Orlando, returning to the current route via SR 50. * When the 20th Street Expressway was built in Jacksonville, SR 15 was rerouted onto it; the old route is now SR 139 (and was first given the number SR 15A).

At the heart of the understanding of Total Ministry is the belief that through baptism all Christian people are gifted for mission and ministry within and for the Church. Many people are introduced to Total Ministry through workshops offered in their diocese or region, through spiritual direction or via retreat. The concept is widely credited with having originated with the apostle Paul, who is said to have commented that the church is a \\"body with many limbs and organs\\". This concept of the \\"priesthood of all believers\\" has led to the development of new patterns of ministry including Total Ministry.

To the north, where it is bordered by Santa Cruz das Flores. The population in 2011 was 1,504,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of .Eurostat Its municipal seat is in the parish of the same name. History The overlook and former fort that defended the port of Lajes One of the former residences in the village of Cauda A view of center of the village of Fajãzinha Flores was discovered by Diogo de Teive and his son, João de Teive, in 1452. Within a year, 20 January 1453, the islands of Corvo Marini (Marine Crows), meaning the islands of Flores and Corvo, was donated to D. Afonso, Duke of Bragança and Count of Barcelso by King Afonso V. On 20 January 1475, João Teive ceded the captaincy to Fernão Teles de Meneses, but by 1 March 1504, the captaincy was donated to João da Fonseca by King Manuel I. The first documented reference to Lajes was to the first religious parish on the island, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of the Rosary). Lajes, the town, was the first area to be populated in the southern part of the island, around the 16th Century; in 1510, owing to its natural port and growing settlement it prospered, attaining the title of \\"vila\\" (town) by 1515 (becoming, some say, the oldest settlement in the Western Group of Azorean islands).Pierluigi Bragaglia, 1996, p.14; Seen as a fragile settlement some historians found it absolutely inadmissible that there should exist a vila in Flores by 1515. In 1587, the small community was destroyed by English privateers, then when the population was more numerous then in Santa Cruz. Initially, Lajes das Flores extended from Ribeira da Silva (now part of the parish of Lomba) to Fajã Grande (which included the localities of Lajedo, Fajãzinha, Caldeira, Mosteiro, Fajã Grande and Fazenda). The western places, with the exception of Lajedo, were de-annexed to form the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Fajã, an independent parish in 1676 (and whose seat in Fajãzinha. Fazenda, was eventually de-annexed in 1919. Around the 19th-Century, due to the rivalries on the small island, and owing to Santa Cruz das Flores' dominance economically and politically, it was undertaken to unify Lajes and Santa Cruz municipalities into one. The Civil Governor of the District of Horta (which included within it the islands of Horta, Flores and Corvo), António José Vieira Santa Rita, in a royal report dated 1869, rationalized that the island could not support two municipalities, and that on the island of Corvo \\"one administrative parish is enough for the population\\". Continuing he affirmed that \\"in actuality, instead of benefitting, the [municipal status] is a burden on the population who would have it alleviated...they find themselves annexed already for falling under...the Municipality of Santa Cruz, and also by the service of the industry and judiciary\\". On June 26, 1867, then national assembly deputy Martens Ferrão had suggested the same in that \\"the two islands Flores and Corvo would be constituted as just one municipality, and that it naturally should be her future.\\" In his analysis, José António Vieira Santa Rita also proposed the extinction of Lajes, finding that the residents of the Villa would unfavourably, but that the rest of the southern settlers would tolerate it. The fusion of the municipalities was forced by decrete on November 18, 1895, and published in the official journal the following day, and included the suppression of the municipalities of Lajes and Corvo. This was appreciated and supported by the Municipal government in Santa Cruz das Flores, during this time governed by the \\"Partido Regenerador (Cartistas)\\", of which the former Martens Ferrão was a member. This change did not last too long; on January 13, 1898, the Cartistas fell out of favor, and the municipalities were restored: Lajes das Flores, Santa Cruz das Flores and Corvo. This change was welcome to the small bourgeois in Lajes; on March 17, 1898, the restored Municipal Council sent a formal letter of thanks to the Minister of the King, José Luciano de Castro, for \\"...the autonomy which was disputed by the populous in general in all the municipality\\". From that session onwards the main square of Lajes was renamed from the plain Largo do Município to Largo do Exmo. Conselheiro José Luciano de Castro. The establishment of the Telecommunications Station and French Base on the Flores (in 1960), although in Santa Cruz, was an economic benefit to most of the citizens in both municipalities. The first aspect station to arrive in Lajes municipality was the Radionaval Station, which was installed in the Lajes lighthouse (in the centre of town). The lands were expropriated for the station in 1945, although the final inauguration did not occur until 1951. In 1965 the LORAN Station of Flores was completed in the parish of Fazenda. The completion of the commercial port in Lajes was significant in altering the roadways of the southern municipality, during the mandate of its President/Mayor Albino Cristiano Gomes.  Geography  Situated on the southern maritime coast and extending to the southwest, the municipality of Lajes is one of two administrative divisions of the island of Flores. The southern municipality is more widely populated then its northern neighbour, although settlements within the interior are considered few and scattered on the rugged landscape. Lajes is included in the Zona de Protecção Especial da Costa Sul e Sudoeste da ilha das Flores (South and Southwest Coast of Flores Special Protection Zone) as part of the Rede Natura 2000. The municipality is composed of seven civil parishes () with their own administrative organs (), they include: * Fajã Grande - located in the basin and fajã on the western coast, with a population of less than 250 inhabitants; * Fajãzinha - less than 100 residents live in this community, located north of Fajã Grande; Fajãzinha is a diminutive of fajã, referring to it being a small agglomeration of homes in the corner of the fajã; * Fazenda - literally meaning \\"commercial goods\\" or \\"location where [these] goods are available for sale\\", it was the last civil parish to be formed (de-annexed from its neighbour in 1919); there less than 300 people living in an area of ; * Lajedo - an agricultural community located 9 km from Lajes, and close to one of the islands ex-libris, the Rocha dos Bordões, as well as other natural monuments; * Lajes das Flores - the seat of the municipal government, located in the southeast coast; largest population center in the municipality; * Lomba - location of the island's first chapel, and neighbour of the parish of Lajes, Lomba literally represents an area border by river-valleys along the southern coast; * Mosteiro - the smallest parish in area and density, with less than 50 residents; it is the second smallest center on the island. The main urban nucleus (Lajes) is implanted in a small area that includes the historical small port and arriba in the southeast, from where the first community of Lajes extending along former footpaths and rural roads. The area is marked by an accented relief of cliffs and mountainous, dominated by patches of forest, alternating with walled pasturelands. Agricultural areas are located between Lajes and Fazenda, situated in the northeast, while the southern coast comprises the Fajã Grande, Fajãzinha, Fazenda, Lajedo, Lajes, Lomba and Mosteiro.  Economy  Lajes economy is driven by agriculture, including dairy production, and a reasonable fishery. In the past, whale-hunting was an aspect of the latter economy, during the 1960-70s, which has since been abandoned, although remnants of this aspect are visible in some of the communities.

Features The E-1 uses the Four Thirds System lens mount and imaging system. This design choice means that because the CCD is smaller than a 35 mm negative, Four Thirds System lenses and camera bodies can be made smaller and lighter than those of preceding SLRs.

Sometimes the user experiences bright spots in long (greater than a few seconds) exposures. This is called long exposure noise. By turning on the \\"Noise Removal\\" (not \\"Noise Filter\\"), the E-1 will do a “dark frame subtraction” to get rid of these erroneous bright spots. The development of the E-1 involved the revitalization of Olympus' old Zuiko lens brand, through a new range named \\"Zuiko Digital\\" with the Four Thirds system lens mount. The E-1 was usually sold bundled with a splash proof Zuiko Digital 14–54 mm 1:2.8–3.5 zoom lens. Olympus initially gave away free adapters to connect OM lenses to the new Four Thirds System mount.

It is currently one of the two operational parts of the RAF Search and Rescue Force left in service (the other being the RAF Mountain Rescue Service) after the stand-down of the UK effort on 5 October 2015. History =World War I= No. 84 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed on 16 February 1917 at East Boldre (Beaulieu) and moved to France in September 1917. It flew the SE.5a over the Western front, at one time based in Bertangles, France until it returned to the UK in August 1919. =Between the wars= The squadron was disbanded on 30 January 1920. Its aces included Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor VC, Hugh Saunders and Walter A. Southey. The squadron was reformed on 13 August 1920 at Baghdad in Iraq, moving to Shaibah in September, where it remained for the next 20 years. Its initial equipment was DH.9As (until January 1929) and these were replaced by Wapitis (beginning July 1928), Vincents (December 1935) and Blenheims Mk.Is (February 1939). One of the squadron's artefacts is a pair of pink frilly knickers known as 'Jane's Panties'. These were presented to the squadron in 1936 by Jane Newman (a debutante from Australia) who was rescued by 84 squadron when her aircraft crashed in the Western Desert. This story may more accurately relate to the location and rescue by Vickers Vincent aircraft of 84 Squadron of Imperial Airways Handley Page H.P. 42E G-AAUC Horsa which forced landed on 29 August 1936, in the Arabian Desert south of Salwa Wells in Qatar, having overflown Bahrein airport. Miss Jane Wallace Smith, an American novelist is named as the presenter of the undergarments to the Squadron.Neate, Don. Scorpions Sting: The Story of No. 84 Squadron Royal Air Force, pg. 31 =World War II= The Squadron flew its first combat operation of the war on 15 August 1940, when six 84 Squadron Blenheims, which were being ferried from Iraq to Aden to reinforce the Blenheim squadrons based there, encountered an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 near Kamaran Island and shot it down. It moved to Heliopolis in Egypt in September 1940, operating from forward bases at Fuka and Qotaifiya for operations against the Germans from October 1940. The Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 resulted in Britain diverting much of its aerial strength to support the Greeks, and 84 Squadron was moved to Greece in November 1940. The squadron operated from Menidi near Athens, initially bombing Italian forces on the Albanian front, but as the Italian offensive stalled in December 1940, switched to attacks against the port of Valona and the airfield at Berat, both in Italian-occupied Albania. In April 1941 German forces invaded Greece, quickly over-running the Greek and British defences, and the few surviving Blenheims were evacuated via Crete on 21 April. The squadron moved to RAF Aqir in Palestine on 27 April as a result of tensions between Britain and Iraq. When hostilities broke out on 2 May, with Iraqi forces threatening the RAF base at Habbaniya, west of Baghdad, 84 Squadron supported the forces sent to relieve Habbaniya, and when Germany and Italy sent air reinforcements to Iraq via airfields in Vichy-French Syria, carried out attacks on these airfields. Operations against Iraqi forces continued until 31 May when the pro-German Iraqi Prime-Minister, Rashid Ali fled and an armistice was signed. It operated in Greece, Iraq, and the Western Desert before moving briefly to the Far East. No. 84 Squadron flew the Vultee Vengeance dive bomber from Assam in North-East India but, contrary to some reports, not the Commonwealth Boomerang fighter from New Guinea during World War II (this was done by No. 84 Squadron RAAF). The squadron re-equipped with the Mosquito in February 1945. In March 1942, eleven members of 84 squadron commandeered a lifeboat and sailed away from Java to escape the advancing Japanese forces. They made land 47 days later in north-western Australia. The lifeboat was named 'Scorpion' in honour of the Squadron Badge. =Postwar= In November 1946 the squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter which they flew until March 1949. In 1949 No. 84 Squadron flew Bristol Brigands during Operation Firedog. The squadron was disbanded on 20 February 1953, but 204 Squadron was renumbered to No. 84 Squadron on the same day. The squadron was the transport squadron for the RAF in the Middle East until 1971. Its Vickers Valetta flight was detached to become No. 233 Squadron RAF on 1 September 1960 at RAF Khormaksar to provide general transport for the British Army in the Aden Protectorate. The Squadron was re-equipped with Beverly C2 at Khormaksar with a detachment at Eastleigh, Kenya being firmly placed there during the Southern Rhodesian wobble 1965(UDI). In late 1967, the Beverly was replaced by the HS Andover, and when UK forces left Aden the Squadron moved to RAF Sharjah, then in the Trucial States (now UAE). The squadron was disbanded at Muharraq on 31 October 1971. = Cyprus = bucket off the coast of Atlit, Israel during firefighting efforts on 3 December 2010 The squadron was reformed on 17 January 1972 from 1563 Flt and a detachment from 230 Sqn with Westland Whirlwind HAR.10s at RAF Akrotiri. The squadron was also based at Nicosia International Airport to aid UNFICYP operations and operate search and rescue. It later (December 1981) replaced the Whirlwind with the Westland Wessex HC.2 and later still (June 1984) with the Westland Wessex HU.5C. It was the last squadron to use the Westland Wessex. No. 84 Squadron was the first RAF contingent into Beirut in the Lebanese Crisis of 1983. This resulted in the evacuation of the peace-keeping element from the city. In January 2003 the squadron has been assigned to British Forces Cyprus at RAF Akrotiri in the search and rescue role using the Bell Griffin HAR.2. In recognition of this role the aircraft are always unarmed and carry a light blue band around their tail, matching the blue berets of UN peacekeepers. 84 Squadron is the only serving squadron never to have been based in the United Kingdom. Symbols The squadron's badge, approved by George VI in December 1936 is the scorpion, and its motto is Scorpiones pungunt, Latin for \\"Scorpions sting\\". As a result, a single pet scorpion named Frank is kept as a mascot at RAF Akrotiri. The squadron is allocated the ICAO designator AKG and the callsign GRIFTER.

Tophi are pathognomonic for the disease gout. Most people with tophi have had previous attacks of acute arthritis, eventually leading to the formation of tophi. Chronic tophaceous gout is known as Harrison Syndrome. Tophi form in the joints, cartilage, bones, and other places throughout the body. Sometimes, tophi break through the skin and appear as white or yellowish-white, chalky nodules. Without treatment, tophi may develop on average about ten years after the onset of gout, although their first appearance can range from three to forty-two years. The development of gouty tophi can also limit joint function and cause bone destruction, leading to noticeable disabilities, especially when gout cannot successfully be treated. When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g., probenecid), this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout (RCG). They are more apt to appear early in the course of the disease in people who are older. Although less common, tophi can also form in the kidneys and nasal cartilage.

The population in 2011 was 202,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 12.97 km².Eurostat Although it is a relatively small population, it is one of the largest centers in the municipality of Lajes das Flores, about from the municipal seat, and the westernmost settlement in Europe.SRAM (March 2012) It contains the localities Cuada, Ponta (da Fajã) and Fajã.  History  The western coast of Flores was slowly occupied in the middle of the 16th Century, with the first population centers forming in the beginning of the 17th Century. The first settlers were captained by João Soares, from the island of São Miguel, and who settled in Lajedo. The fertile land permitted the cultivation of woad, one of the most important commercial ventures in the Azores. As the Azorean chronicler Father Gaspar Frutuoso writing in the 16th Century, indicated, that the colonists benefited from the abundance of water and easy access to the sea: :\\"There, about a quarter league is Fajã, called \\"Big\\" [referring to its name Great/Grande Fajã] which offers bread and woad on elevated land, with a few berths for Caravels, it produces at least 50 moios [Portuguese unit of solid measure] of bread and woad, and where, also, there is shellfish and fish of all kinds, and along its cape a beach, half a league in size, where there is always a strong ocean current; and from there, another half a league, the cliffs are covered with much urzela [a lichen], and large rocks, that spawn an infinity of seafood and large crabs, and from here, there is an explosion of rocks that fall to the sea, like a guns spray, where we find limpets and cowrie shells; and in front of this point, which forms a bay, where many type of ships anchor, including Carracks from India. In the middle of this anchorage a great river-valley falls from the cliffs to sea.\\" Although being populated for less than a century, Fajã Grande was already a center of commercial activity; caravels arriving from India were likely to stopover in Fajã Grande since it was one of the first ports to be discovered on their return. On the port of Fajã Grande, Father José António Camões, noted the following about its installations: :\\"...there is a small breakwater called Baixa d’Agoa. Continue down until you get to the port of Fajã Grande, which has in the middle a great mound of sand and rock called Calhau da Barra. Within this Calhau is a large \\"puddle\\" called the Poção, which gives refuge to ships that arrive from the sea.\\" The fertility of the land permitted the cultivation of the lichen Rocella tinctoria (Roccellaceae), a plant sought after by many of the commercial interests in the region eager to support the dye industries of Europe. The abundance of fresh water, and port, also made Fajã Grande an important stopover for pirates and privateers; while other communities in the archipelago lived in fear of pirates, Fajã Grande maintained a collaborative relationship and sold consumables to local crews. It was likely one of the most prosperous communities in the western coast, resulting in its de-annexation from the neighbouring parish of Lajes das Flores, in July 1676. To create the new parish of Fajãs, the local community in Ponta da Fajã was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of São Pedro de Ponta Delgada and integrated into the new administrative and ecclesiastical division. The formal delimitation of the parish was presided by Father Domingos Nunes Pereira, and the new Fajãs parish priest Father André Alves de Mendonça, on 12/13 July 1676. Writing around 1720, Father António Cordeiro, affirmed that the Fajãs included about 80 homes. The creation of an autonomous parish in Fajã Grande dates back to 1855, when the administration of the District of Horta attempted to resolve the call by its residents to create a new civil parish. The debate was finally ended by the Civil Governor, Luís Teixeira de Sampaio, who reported on 3 April 1857, that a single parish of Fajã Grande was desirable, owing to its distance from the community of Fajãzinha (then parish seat), the size of its community, and the problem caused by annual floodings along the Riberia Grande river, which regularly cut links annually. Local narratives mention several instances when the Ribeira Grande impeded travel to Fajãzinha, resulting in the faithful having services at the Pedra da Missa (), an elevated point on the river bank where they gathered, prayed and then dispersed after celebrating the liturgy. Governor Sampaio also noted that American whaling and high-seas travel had brought a new importance to the village, also justifying a rethink of the existing administrative divisions. Finally, on 4 April 1861, King Pedro V of Portugal decreed the creation of a new ecclesiastical parish, to include Ponta, Fajã Grande and Cuada, centred on the Church of São José da Fajã Grande (the responsibility of the Bishop of Angra, friar Estêvão de Jesus Maria, dated 20 June 1861. The parochial church was constructed from the small chapel (which was built in 1755, and blessed on 24 May 1757); the new temple was blessed on 1 August 1850, after three years of construction (it was finally completed in 1849). Due to further support from American emigrant José Luís da Silveira, the church was remodelled in 1880. A new church was later constructed in the area of Ponta da Fajã (the Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo) and remained in use until 1922. Similarly, on 28 September 1969, a chapel in Ponta was completed, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Fátima. Landslides around the area of Ponta da Fajã in 1987 resulted in the declaration of this zone as high risk resulting in the express prohibition of new buildings and future remodeling of existing homes. Further landslides around Covas, in 1991, resulted in new laws to restrict residents in the area, which was ignored by the 20 inhabitants, who have maintained existing buildings .A recent plan to remove building restrictions by the residents was not supported  Geography  The Rocha da Fajã Escarpment showing many of the waterfalls and cliff face, Fajã Grande The port and swimming area of the main town = Physical geography = The village is located in an extensive fajã (a small area of flat fertile land at the bottom of a seaside cliff composed of volcanic and geomorphological debris) on the western coast and delimited by the Rocha da Fajã escarpment (that extends from the northwest to southeast border) and the Ribeira Grande river along the south. The escarpment is an almost sheer cliff face, approximately 600 meters in some places. The rest of Fajã Grande is formed from erosional forces along the Rocha da Fajã, producing a rich soil, although rocky, that is nutrient-rich due to the abundance of water from river tributaries. The escarpment is also a protective feature, permitting the cultivation of orchards and small parcels, and yams in the well-irrigated parcels along the river. Above the Rocha, about , the parish extends onto an irregular plateau covered in natural vegetation and peat. The excessive precipitation in this region, which usually exceeds annually, means that the river-valleys are always flooded or inundated. The northwest border extends along the western coast of the parish on a strip of land adjacent to the escarpment. Situated on the plateau are four large crater lakes, Lagoa da Caldeira Funda (Lake of the Deep Crater), Lagoa da Caldeira Comprida (Lake of the Long Crater) and Lagoa da Caldeira Branca (Lake of the White Crater) which are full throughout the year, and the peat-covered Lagoa da Caldeira Seca (Lake of the Dry Crater) which only occasionally becomes flooded. The Lagoa dos Patos (Lake of the Ducks) is located at the base of the plateau. Off the western coast, the Monchique Islet, is the westernmost point of the Azores (and Europe). =Human geography= Westernmost village in the Azores, Portugal and Europe The escarpment surrounds the community composed of three nuclei: Fajã Grande (the largest population), Ponta da Fajã Grande (a narrow strip between the coast and Rocha da Fajã), and Cuada (a settlement located on a plateau bordering the parish of Fajãzinha to the south). Cuada, for many years, was a collection of uninhabited homes, but today it has been rejuvenated by rural tourism, and classified as an Area of Municipal Interest. The port at Fajã Grande, once an important commercial port, has lost much of its importance and is now used recreationally and, only rarely, for disembarking commercial goods. The entire zone is valued for its coastal waters, attracting both swimmers and surfers from around the island. Between 1960 and 1980, approximately 60% of the active population emigrated to the United States and Canada. Economy Fajã Grande had always been characterized by its land and connection to the sea, resulting in a considerable part of its population employed in the primary industries (about 50%), that included agriculture, livestock husbandry and fishing. Over time, secondary industries began to occupy a greater part of the local activities (but generally hovered around 20% of activities), and primarily tourism, commerce and complementary services.

Culture Generally, Fajã Grande is typical of rural associativism, an agricultural centre underpinned by the socio-cultural dynamism of sport and social celebration. Fajã Grande includes several collective groups involved in daily life: * Tuna Sol Mar, created in early 1993, it comprises people with interest in the musical arts, including playing, chorus and folklore traditional of Flores; * Filarmónica União Musical Nossa Senhora da Saúde, instituted in 1950, a philharmonic band comprising 15 elements, whom promote music at local and regional festivities; * Casa do Povo de Fajã Grande, a physical space, the people's house functions as a local social assistance and hall for meetings and events. Notable citizens Fajã Grande has, over time, been a cradle for a few personalities, who have become notable in Azorean history, including specifically: * José António Camões (Fajãzinha; 10 December 1777 -- Ponta Delgada, 18 January 1827), a Catholic priest, poet, instructor, historian, and author of various works of satire, including his heroic satire O Testamento de D. Burro, Pai dos Asnos (The Testament of D. Burro, Father of the Asses), where he skewered Florentine society. Betrayed by the slighted members of the nobility and Roman Catholic clerics, he died a pauper. But, in the 20th century, his prose and incites brought the priest new fame, for his contributions to the local poor and his support for education; * José Luís de Fraga, a Roman Catholic priest, noted for his oratory, writings and musical abilities; * João Joaquim André de Freitas (Fajã Grande, 1860 — Lisbon, 22 June 1929), better known as Senator André de Freitas, he was a politician and benmerit, who began his career as a deputy within the Regenerator Party, and nominated to the post of Civil Governor of the district of Horta in 1908; * Pedro Laureano Mendonça da Silveira (Fajã Grande, 5 September 1922 — Lisbon, 2003)), literary critic, historian and poet, with several public works. He was part of the executive board of the magazine Seara Nova (until 1974) and author of various works of poetry and literature including the A Ilha e o Mundo (1953).

Parsons served on the school board of the Hastings—Prince Edward district from 1982 to 1999. Politics In the 1999 provincial election he defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Gary Fox by 56 votes in Prince Edward—Hastings. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Parsons spent the next four years in opposition. The Liberals won the 2003 provincial election, and Parsons was re-elected in Prince Edward—Hastings by over 10,000 votes over Tory John Williams. He was named parliamentary assistant to Ontario Minister of Transportation Harinder Takhar on October 23, 2003, and parliamentary assistant to Sandra Pupatello, the Ontario Minister of Community and Social Services on September 27, 2004. He shared the latter position with Deb Matthews. Following the death of his adopted son, Sandy, in 2004, Parsons introduced a Private Members Bill, that became known as Sandy's Law. The law requires establishments to display a sign warning of the dangers of consuming alcohol while pregnant. Although Private member's bills rarely pass into law, Sandy's law received unanimous support and was passed into law later in the year. On June 30, 2007, Parsons was appointed a Justice of the Peace effective July 12. The appointment has garnered accusations of patronage from the opposition parties. As the appointment occurred within six months of the 2007 provincial election, scheduled for October, there was no by-election to fill the vacancy. Parsons had already announced in late 2006 that he would not run in the 2007 election.

The population in 2011 was 93,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of approximately .Eurostat History Nossa Senhora dos Milagres de Lajedo, was one of the first settlements on the island, camouflaged and protected from North Atlantic pirates by the ridges and rocky outcrops where the settlements began. In fact, its name (Lajedo) means pavement covered in slabs; place where there are many slabs; large slabs and smooth, indicating the type of geology discovered by first explorers. Its 637 hectares of fertile soils, were explained by Isatis Tinctoria as ideal conditions to shelter and support those who wanted to live in the zone. This is how João Soares dos Mosteiros, a native of the island of São Miguel, who made shore on the site and decided to stay, colonize and develop the region. Gaspar Frutuoso later wrote: :\\"By his hands [he] made, caulked and constructed a boat, without knowing any of these trades, and went with his wife and children to hear mass in the village of Lajes. They said of him, that when he returned home, he asked of his oldest daughter to take the boat up, and she placed it on her head and placed it where she wanted, for it was small and badly made, but served him, for the road was laborious, and many times this João Soares, went to Lajes on this small boat and, at times, fished in it.\\" The chronicler also registered the existence of two islets in the seat, land for animal raising and little pastureland to the interior, but that sustained game birds. Along the coast Frutuoso indicated the availability of sheltered anchorages and a freshwater ravine that could support ships by providing potable water. This area, which he referred as Lajedos, because the land is flatten and cliffs little high, that provide bread and woad. Father José António Camões writing in 1815 described the region in these terms: :...there is a fajã called Costa, that has many vineyards, many fruit orchards, much like the rest of the island...within the islet Cartario, there is another smaller, and within this a cove called Portinho do Lajedo, where there wades small boats, but only with a lot of calm...[the hermitage of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres]...to which many devotees concur, it is more probable, that their devotion consists without exception in carrying their violins, and playing and dancing with the girls, etc. The parish of Lajedo was created by regal charter at the end of 1823, even though a parish had already existed since 1781, under the invocation of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres. This temple was reconstructed in 1868, under the supervision of the parish priest, Father Francisco Luís de Freitas Henriques. The new parish was delimited by the Ribeira da Lapa, Rebentão and Rocha Alta, and the Rector assigned a priest for \\"four moios and 501 bushels of wheat and 8000 réis in money and a Treasurer for 1 moio of wheat and 3000 réis, that included hosts and wine, to be paid for by the island treasury\\". Lajedo depended, administratively, on the municipality of Santa Cruz between 1895 and 1898, during the suppression of Lajes das Flores, when only one municipality existed on the island. Electricity arrived to the region late, only on 4 February 1978, where until then work at night was done by whale oil lamps, kerosene or fire light. Pierluigi Bragaglia, an Italian who lived in Lajes, wrote of a curious episode associated with the agricultural cooperative Ilha das Flores, whose seat was in Lajedo, and ultimately powered the local economy and provided electricity. :It was this last parish of Flores that abandoned the old lamps and whale oil, whose director of the Cooperative, José de Freitas Escobar Júnior, installed, with several years in advance, a turbine in a ravine below the village, and with a system of wires he could turn on the light of his office...to do his accounts, an early night...by means of a simple interruptor; almost a miracle for other parishes. José de Freitas Escobar Júnior, was one of the more important figures in the Azores, owing to his management and directorship of the Cooperative Ilha das Flores, for 40 years. Native of Flores, he had emigrated to the United State and later to Brazil, before returning some years later when his brother was gravely ill. He decided to remain, because he felt he could contribute to Lajedo; the fact that he had engineered electrical light thirty years before the electrification of the parish, already made him a popular figure. The system was complex, but its functioning demonstrated the authors capacity: he was made president of the municipal council of Lajes between 1944 and 1946 and, once again in 1948. He died in 1986, at the age of 84, in the parish of Mosteiro. Geography Situated in the extreme southern portion of the island of Flores, Lajedo is located from the seat of the municipality (Lajes) and from the regional airport in Santa Cruz das Flores. The parish consists of several smaller communities and localities, including specifically the villages of Campanário and Costa, an area that is primarily marked by fertile pasturelands supported by the ravines of Campanário and Lapa, that cross the territory.

It is Levinson’s screen-directing debut, and the first of his tetralogy, “Baltimore Films”, set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. ‘’Tin Men‘’ (1987), ‘’Avalon‘’ (1990), and ‘’Liberty Heights‘’ (1999) are the other three. It stars Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Paul Reiser, Kevin Bacon, Timothy Daly and Ellen Barkin and was released on March 5, 1982. The film follows a close-knit circle of friends who reunite at a Baltimore diner when one of them prepares to get married. Plot In 1959 Baltimore, friends Modell, Eddie, Shrevie, Boogie, and Fenwick attend a Christmas dance before driving to their usual late-night haunt, Fell’s Point Diner. On the way, Fenwick stages a fake car accident, to his friends’ annoyance. Boogie, a hairdresser and law student, has laid a $2,000 bet on a basketball game, and declines his family friend Bagel’s offer to call off the bet. Modell accepts a ride home from Eddie while the others pick up another friend, Billy, who is in town to serve as Eddie’s best man for his wedding on New Year’s Eve. The next morning, Billy reunites with Eddie at his mother’s house, and they visit their old pool hall. Shrevie, married to Beth and working as an appliance store salesman, learns from Fenwick that Boogie is taking a date to the movies. At a screening of ‘’A Summer Place‘’, with his friends watching, Boogie tricks his date, Carol, into groping him through the popcorn box on his lap. She runs from the theater, but the smooth-talking Boogie convinces her it was an accident and their date continues; afterward, Billy punches an old high school enemy. Billy visits Barbara, a friend working at the local TV station. At the diner, Shrevie discusses married life with Eddie, who is preparing a test of football knowledge for his fiancée Elyse, to determine if they will marry. Having lost his basketball bet, Boogie wagers with his friends that he can have sex with Carol. The group parts ways in the morning, and Boogie and Fenwick encounter an equestrienne named Jane. Meeting Barbara at church, Billy learns she is pregnant, the result of an unexpected night they spent together; she tries to dissuade him from feeling obligated to marry her. Watching “College Bowl“, Fenwick is surprisingly knowledgeable, and offers to help pay Boogie’s debt. Shrevie loses his temper at Beth for disturbing his record collection, and storms out. Boogie consoles Beth, and Fenwick goes to his brother, who refuses to lend him money. Shrevie pulls Eddie and Billie from a screening of ‘’The Seventh Seal‘’ to corral Fenwick, who has drunkenly occupied the church’s Nativity scene in his underwear, leading to the friends’ arrest. In the holding cells, Eddie reveals that Elyse will take his test the following night, and Billy faces down a belligerent drunk. Eddie, Shrevie, and Billy are bailed out by their fathers, but Fenwick’s father leaves him in jail. They meet Boogie at the diner, and he deduces that Eddie is still a virgin, while Billy and Barbara discuss their predicament at the TV station. A lonely Beth visits Boogie at the hair salon, and he is threatened by his bookie, Tank. Learning Carol has the flu, which jeopardizes his bet, Boogie reminisces with Beth about their own past relationship, and they make plans for a tryst while everyone is busy with Elyse’s test. Shrevie, Fenwick, Billy, and Modell, along with Eddie’s and Elyse’s parents, await the results of the football test: Elyse fails by two points, and Eddie calls off the wedding. Boogie brings Beth a wig, secretly planning to disguise her as Carol to win the bet, and drives her to Fenwick’s apartment. There, Fenwick and Shrevie hide in the closet to verify the encounter, but Boogie tells Beth the truth, urging her to work things out with Shrevie. Eddie and Billie visit a strip club, and Boogie arrives at the diner, where Shrevie and Fenwick warn him Tank is waiting. Boogie is ready to accept the consequences, but Tank reveals that Bagel has paid off the debt. Billy commandeers a piano to lead the entire strip club in a rousing number, to Eddie’s delight. At the diner, Eddie decides to marry Elyse after all, and Billy assures Barbara he genuinely loves her. The wedding proceeds, themed around Eddie’s beloved Baltimore Colts: Shrevie and Beth reconcile; Boogie, Billy, and Fenwick bring Jane, Barbara, and Diane; and Billy delivers a heartfelt speech. The movie ends as the bouquet is tossed, landing on the friends’ table. Cast * Steve Guttenberg as Edward “Eddie” Simmons * Daniel Stern as Laurence “Shrevie” Schreiber * Mickey Rourke as Robert “Boogie” Sheftell * Kevin Bacon as Timothy Fenwick, Jr. * Tim Daly as William “Billy” Howard * Ellen Barkin as Beth * Paul Reiser as Modell * Kathryn Dowling as Barbara * Michael Tucker as Bagel * Colette Blonigan as Carol Heathrow * Jessica James as Mrs. Simmons * Clement Fowler as Eddie’s father * Kelle Kipp as Diane This was the first credited feature film role for Tim Daly, Ellen Barkin and Paul Reiser. Production The semi-autobiographical film explores the changing relationships among these friends as they become adults through what is mostly a series of vignettes rather than a traditional narrative. Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture realistic camaraderie. During postproduction, an executive David Chasman wanted to cut the scene about an unfinished roast-beef sandwich because it didn’t advance the story, but Levinson explained the roast beef was the story, telling audiences all they need to know about their friendship, their competitiveness and their fears. Executive producer Mark Johnson, obtained a print without MGM’s knowledge and screened it privately for critics Pauline Kael and James Wolcott. Kael made it clear she was going to write a rave review even if MGM did not release the film, and that other critics planned to do the same. Adaptations The film inspired a 1983 CBS television pilot written and directed by Levinson. Mike Binder starred as Eddie, Paul Reiser returned as Modell, Michael Madsen took over as Boogie and James Spader was Fenwick. =Stage adaptation= A stage musical, with the book by Levinson and music by Sheryl Crow is being prepared, with plans for a Broadway production, originally opening in Autumn 2013. Kathleen Marshall is the director and choreographer. A “creative workshop” reading was held in December 2011, directed by Kathleen Marshall. A previously announced premiere at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco in October 2012 to November 2012 was cancelled. Instead, the musical had a staged workshop in New York and then was expected to open on Broadway in April 2013 (since postponed). The producer said, “the producers and creative team of ‘Diner’ embarked on an exploratory exercise to determine if the show would play as effectively in a theatre with a capacity no larger than 1,100 seats, for which there is greater opportunity. Holding themselves to uncompromising standards they happily discovered that their answer was ‘yes’.”\\"'Diner Musical Delays\\" hollywoodreporter.comJones, Kenneth. \\"Musical 'Diner' Will Open on Broadway April 10, 2013, Following Fall Workshop; Expect an Intimate Show\\" .

The website’s critics consensus states: “Diner transports audiences back to the 1950s with a refreshing lack of sentimentality, evoking the thrill of everyday life with its ensemble’s potent chemistry and an authentic sense of spontaneity.” On Metacritic it has a score of 82% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating “universal acclaim”. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker called it “A wonderful movie…It isn’t remarkable visually, but features some of the best young actors in the country.” Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 and wrote: “Diner is often a very funny movie, although I laughed most freely not at the sexual pranks but at the movie’s accurate ear, as it reproduced dialogue with great comic accuracy.” Variety wrote: “Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser and Timothy Daly are terrific as the friends as are Ellen Barkin and Kathryn Dowling as the two females involved with different group members.” Author Nick Hornby called the film “a work of great genius.” John Wells executive produce on the TV series E.R. estimated he saw the film thirty times in 1982 alone, and he makes a point to watch the film every year. =Accolades= Levinson received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

It may also be used for hiccups and muscle spasms near the end of life. It is taken by mouth or by delivery into the spinal canal. Common side effects include sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects may occur if baclofen is rapidly stopped including seizures and rhabdomyolysis. Use in pregnancy is of unclear safety while use during breastfeeding is probably safe. It is believed to work by decreasing neurotransmitters. Baclofen was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 140th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses Baclofen is primarily used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Its use in people with stroke or Parkinson's disease is not recommended. Baclofen has also been used for the treatment of alcohol use disorder but evidence as of a systematic review conducted in 2018 shows that the evidence of its use as a first line intervention remains uncertain. Side effects Briefly, adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, trouble sleeping, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, or constipation. A complete list of reported adverse effects can be found on the product insert.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/022462s000lbl.pdf =Withdrawal syndrome= Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if baclofen is administered intrathecally or for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen. Withdrawal symptoms may include auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, delusions, confusion, agitation, delirium, disorientation, fluctuation of consciousness, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, inattention, memory impairments, perceptual disturbances, itching, anxiety, depersonalization, hypertonia, hyperthermia (higher than normal temperature without infection), formal thought disorder, psychosis, mania, mood disturbances, restlessness, and behavioral disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, tremors, autonomic dysfunction, hyperpyrexia (fever), extreme muscle rigidity resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rebound spasticity. =Abuse= Russian baclofen (branded Baclosan) 25 mg tablets with a warning reads: \\"This drug may cause psychomotor retardation\\" Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not appear to possess addictive properties, and has not been associated with any degree of drug craving. Euphoria is however listed as a common to very common side- effect of baclofen in the BNF 75 There are very few cases of abuse of baclofen for reasons other than attempted suicide. In contrast to baclofen, another GABAB receptor agonist, γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABAB receptor, but rather by activation of the GHB receptor. Although baclofen does not produce euphoria or other reinforcing effects, which is unlike alcohol and benzodiazepines (as well as GHB), it does similarly possess sedative and antianxiety properties. Overdose Reports of overdose indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including vomiting, general weakness, sedation, respiratory insufficiency, seizures, unusual pupil size, dizziness, headaches, itching, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypertension, hyporeflexia, coma, and death. Pharmacology Chemically, baclofen is a derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is believed to work by activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors, specifically the GABAB receptors. Its beneficial effects in spasticity result from its actions in the brain and spinal cord. =Pharmacodynamics= Baclofen produces its effects by activating the GABAB receptor, similar to the drug phenibut which also activates this receptor and shares some of its effects. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory ligand, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. However, baclofen does not have significant affinity for the GHB receptor, and has no known abuse potential. The modulation of the GABAB receptor is what produces baclofen's range of therapeutic properties. Similarly to phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as pregabalin (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block α2δ subunit- containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 μM for R- and S-phenibut and 156 μM for baclofen). Moreover, baclofen is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the GABAB receptor in comparison to phenibut, and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of baclofen on α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs are likely not clinically-relevant. =Pharmacokinetics= The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low: the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The half-life of baclofen is roughly 2–4 hours; it therefore needs to be administered frequently throughout the day to control spasticity appropriately. Chemistry Baclofen is a white (or off-white) mostly odorless crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform. History Historically, baclofen was designed as a drug for treating epilepsy. It was first made at Ciba-Geigy, by the Swiss chemist Heinrich Keberle, in 1962. Its effect on epilepsy was disappointing, but it was found that in certain people, spasticity decreased. Currently, baclofen continues to be given by mouth, with variable effects. In severely affected children, the oral dose is so high that side-effects appear, and the treatment loses its benefit. How and when baclofen came to be used in the spinal sac (intrathecally) remains unclear, but , this has become an established method of treating spasticity in many conditions. In his 2008 book, Le Dernier Verre (translated literally as The Last Glass or The End of my Addiction), French- American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave $750,000 to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004. The trial concluded, \\"Neither low nor high doses of baclofen were effective in the treatment of [alcohol dependence]. Adverse events were frequent, although generally mild and transient. Therefore, large-scale prescription of baclofen for the treatment of AD seems premature and should be reconsidered.\\" Society and culture =Routes of administration= Baclofen 20 mg oral tablet Baclofen can be administered transdermally as part of a pain-relieving and muscle-relaxing topical cream mix at a compounding pharmacy, orallyCID 3738, Tablet or intrathecallyCID 2284 (directly into the cerebral spinal fluid) using a pump implanted under the skin. Intrathecal pumps offer much lower doses of baclofen because they are designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. They are often preferred in spasticity patients such as those with spastic diplegia, as very little of the oral dose actually reaches the spinal fluid. Besides those with spasticity, intrathecal administration is also used in patients with multiple sclerosis who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen's skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and the reservoir in the pump can be replenished by percutaneous injection. The pump also has to be replaced about every 5 years due to the battery life and other wear. =Other names= Synonyms include chlorophenibut. Brand names include Beklo, Baclodol, Flexibac, Gablofen, Kemstro, Liofen, Lioresal, Lyflex, Clofen, Muslofen, Bacloren, Baklofen, Sclerofen, Pacifen and others. Research Baclofen is being studied for the treatment of alcoholism. Evidence as of 2019 is not conclusive enough to recommend its use for this purpose. In 2014, the French drug agency ANSM issued a 3-year temporary recommendation allowing the use of baclofen in alcoholism.\\"Une recommandation temporaire d’utilisation (RTU) est accordée pour le baclofène – Point d'information\\", ANSM, 14 March 2014. In 2018, baclofen received a Marketing Authorization for use in alcoholism treatment from the agency if all other treatments are not effective. It is being studied along with naltrexone and sorbitol for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy. It is also being studied for cocaine addiction. Baclofen and other muscle relaxants are being studied for potential use for persistent hiccups. From 2014 to 2017 baclofen misuse, toxicity and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased.

Geography Sochaux lies east of Montbéliard, and southeast of Paris. Population Inhabitants are known as Sochaliens. Economy Sochaux is the site of a large industrial facility of the French auto manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroën. As of late 2005, about 16,000 people are employed there. The town also contains the Peugeot automobile museum. Peugeot's badge, the lion rampant, is derived from the town's coat-of-arms. Second World War After the fall of France, the Peugeot factory was converted to produce tanks for Germany, and later, parts for the V1 doodlebugs.\\"The Ministry of ungentlemanly warfare\\" by Giles Milton, John Murray, 2016 On 15/16 July 1943, the R.A.F. sent 165 Halifax bombers to attack the Peugeot motor factory; five were lost. 750 tons of high explosive were dropped. The outcome of this raid illustrated again the difficulties of hitting relatively small targets in the occupied countries and the danger to surrounding civilians. The night was clear, the target was only lightly defended and the attack altitude was 6,000 to 10,000 ft, but the centre of the group of markers dropped by the Pathfinder crews of 35 Squadron was 700 yards beyond the factory. The factory was classed as 5 per cent damaged; the production was normal immediately after the raid.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706055428/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul43.html 125 residents were killed and 260 were seriously injured. Over 100 houses were destroyed, and 400 more were badly damaged. When this news reached London, the R.A.F. prepared to send another raid. However, a British S.O.E. agent, Harry Ree, telephoned the owner, Rodolphe Peugeot, and explained that sabotage would be far more effective, and would leave the structures undamaged. The owner gave his whole-hearted support. On the night of 3 November, the chief electrician, Pierre Lucas, and the foreman, Andre van der Straaten, and three other workers, having hidden explosives in the factory, went to lay the charges. They were intercepted by some German guards who were kicking a football around, and were challenged to a France vs Germany football match, during which a limpet mine fell from the pocket of a saboteur. A German called out, \\"You have dropped something\\", and the saboteur quickly picked it up. But the game went on too long, so the attack was postponed for two nights, and was carried out appropriately on Guy Fawkes' Night. The factory was out of commission for six months.\\"The Ministry of ungentlemanly warfare\\" by Giles Milton, John Murray, 2016 Sport The FC Sochaux-Montbéliard football club is located in the town, and currently plays in Ligue 2.

History and profile Super Express was established in 1991. The paper, owned and published by the Media Express, is best known for publications about political scandals. The former owners of the paper were Bonnier and ZPR Express, each held %50. Before the 1993 and 1995 elections in Poland Super Express published pre-election polls, although there's a 24-hour time period without media information about politics. The paper published also photos of Polish Television (TVP) war-correspondent Waldemar Milewicz's body after he was killed by the Iraqi insurgents. For the first decade of its operation (until 2003) Super Express ranked as second in Poland in terms of the quality of information and sale results, behind the leading Gazeta Wyborcza. The editorial profile of SE changed for a few years to a more competitive format after the introduction of Fakt published by German conglomerate Axel Springer AG, which became the most popular Polish daily. Since 2007, with the new editor-in-chief formerly from Fact, Super Express adjusted its profile to become (similar to Fact) \\"a noble version of the tabloid daily\\" with a wide range of readership.Andrea Czepek, Melanie Hellwig, Eva Nowak, Press Freedom and Pluralism in Europe: Concepts and Conditions, Intellect Books, 2009, illustrated, 308 pages, The newspaper came under criticism from the Bundestag, the German parliament after publishing a photo- montage picturing Polish national football team coach Leo Beenhakker carrying the severed heads of German national football team head coach Joachim Löw and captain Michael Ballack in the buildup of their UEFA Euro 2008 Group B opener against the Germans in Klagenfurt (Austria). Peter Danckert, head of the Bundestag's sport committee, called upon the Sejm, the Polish parliament, to take appropriate action on Super Express, labelling the issue a scandal. Beenhakker has since distanced himself from the image, calling the people who put together the spread named \\"bring us their heads\\" \\"sick\\".

As of the 2010 census the population of Sun Village was 11,565, up from 9,375 at the 2000 census. Sun Village has been awarded federal, state, and county grants for the community based on this Avenue U boundary. There is a movement from the Sun Village Town Council to rebrand the area with the Sun Village name, which fell out of popularity in the early 1980s. New road signage erected around 2011 now labels Sun Village as a unique community. In 2007, the Sun Village and Littlerock town councils formed a Community Standard District together, and it was approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. In September 3, 2014, officials from Sun Village and the city of Palmdale gathered at the Palmdale City Council Chamber to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which Palmdale removed its sphere of influence from Sun Village. Sun Village residents, as in many other Antelope Valley communities, take part in local pageants and parades. The community operates its own local chamber of commerce and town council.

As its name suggests, the parish consists of a number of small settlements in the lower reaches of the River Cuckmere.Parish Election results (includes map showing location of the parish) The settlements There are three villages within the Cuckmere Valley: Litlington, Lullington and Westdean. Archaeological remains nearer the coast at Exceat suggest a further settlement there in former times. The civil parish of Cuckmere Valley was created in 1990 when Litlington, Lullington and Westdean parishes were abolished, with small areas transferred between Litlington and Alfriston, which remained a separate civil parish. =Litlington= Chalk horse figure near Litlington The name is Saxon, and probably indicates Litl's homestead. The twelfth- century church is dedicated to St Michael the Archangel. Maria Fitzherbert (1756–1837), mistress of George IV, lived at Clapham House in the village. In 1924 a chalk figure of a horse was cut into the downs to the west of the village, replacing one cut in the 19th century. The village inn is the Plough and Harrow. =Lullington= Lullington is the most northerly of the three, about southeast of Lewes. It lies on a shoulder of the South Downs at the point where the River Cuckmere cuts through the downs, on the opposite bank of the river to Alfriston.Kelly's Directory of Kent, Surrey & Sussex, 1891 Lullington notes A medieval village, Lullington Court, was abandoned after the Black Death in the 14th century; its site was to the east of the present Lullington. The church, dedicated to the Good Shepherd, is believed to be the smallest in England, having been rebuilt using only the original chancel after a fire had destroyed the remainder of the building. Services are held only in the summer months, as the building has no electricity. =Exceat= Exceat (pronounced ex-seat) was an ancient village. The A259 goes by it just east of the River Cuckmere. The name may have come from æc-sceat, an oak grove, or from the Old English for \\"the place of the Aese\\", early kings of Kent whilst another etymology is possible from Brittonic wysg meaning water or river (or possibly \\"esgair meaning ridge) and ceat meaning woods, hence \\"Wooded River\\" or \\"Wooded Ridge\\". After the Norman conquest, the village was given to Robert, Count of Mortain, half brother of William the Conqueror. Both Exceat and the land were given later to Grestein Priory in Wilmington. Until the 14th century, Exceat was an important village with its own church. The village suffered French raids; it suffered many fatalities during the Black Death, as was effectively abandoned by the 15th century. The main features are the Visitors Centre for the nearby Seven Sisters and the Cuckmere Inn Public House across Exceat Bridge over the Cuckmere. =West Dean= All Saints Church, West Dean West Dean (or Westdean) is located on the edge of Friston Forest. Its church is dedicated to All Saints. Landmarks The National Trust owns land on the western side of the river south of the A259. In addition, there are three Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish; Seaford to Beachy Head, Wilmington Downs and Lullington Heath. Seaford to Beachy Head is a large site of biological and geological importance. The area contains a wide variety of habitats based on the chalk bedrock, which hosts a wide range of flora and fauna, including some nationally rare species. Wilmington Downs is another area of biological interest; its chalk grassland is habitat for several rare species. Lullington Heath is also of biological interest due to its chalk heath and grassland habitats.

The sect sprang from a Philadelphian society founded at Elberfeld in 1726 by Elias Eller and the pastor Daniel Schleiermacher. Eller was the foreman of a factory owned by a rich widow. He read eagerly the writings of ancient and modern visionaries, and then formed an apocalyptic, millenarian system of his own. He made such an impression on the widow, twenty years his senior, that she married him. Thus he obtained the means and influence to draw adherents around himself. The pastor Schleiermacher, grandfather of the celebrated theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, was also influenced by Eller. The prophetess of the society was the daughter of a baker, Anna van Bushel, who had dreams and visions and saw apparitions. After the death of his wife, Eller married her. She called herself mother of Zion, her husband father of Zion, and prophesied that she would bear the saviour of the world. The new order of things was to begin in 1730. Her first child was a daughter, but Eller was able to console the society with Scriptural texts. A son born in 1733, died two years later. Eller made himself the central point of theology. Christian morality was replaced by the craving for coarse and sensual pleasures. In 1737, the sect left Elberfeld and founded Ronsdorf which soon prospered, and, through Eller's influence, was raised by the State in 1745, to the rank of a city. Eller took the most important offices for himself, lived with his wife in great pomp, and generally governed tyrannically. When Eller's wife died suddenly, in 1744, doubts arose in the mind of Schleiermacher, who was pastor at Ronsdorf. He confessed his mistake, and sought to open the eyes of the deceiving leader, but Eller managed to maintain himself until death. The sect was carried on by the pastors who took Schleiermacher's place, by Eller's stepson Bolckhaus, and continued to exist until 1768. The new pastor chosen in this year, and his successors, brought back the inhabitants of Ronsdorf to Protestantism. The after-effects of the movement could be traced into the nineteenth century.

A germline mutation, or germinal mutation, is any detectable variation within germ cells (cells that, when fully developed, become sperm and ovum). Mutations in these cells are the only mutations that can be passed on to offspring, when either a mutated sperm or oocyte come together to form a zygote. After this fertilization event occurs, germ cells divide rapidly to produce all of the cells in the body, causing this mutation to be present in every somatic and germline cell in the offspring; this is also known as a constitutional mutation. Germline mutation is distinct from somatic mutation. Germline mutations can be caused by a variety of endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external) factors, and can occur throughout zygote development. A mutation that arises only in germ cells can result in offspring with a genetic condition that is not present in either parent; this is because the mutation is not present in the rest of the parents' body, only the germline. Due to many severe diseases stemming from de novo germline mutations, different gene editing techniques can be used to induce DNA breaks and repair the mutation.  When mutagenesis occurs  Germline mutations can occur before fertilization and during various stages of zygote development. When the mutation arises will determine the effect it has on offspring. If the mutation arises in either the sperm or the oocyte before development, then the mutation will be present in every cell in the individual's body. A mutation that arises soon after fertilization, but before germline and somatic cells are determined, then the mutation will be present in a large proportion of the individual's cell with no bias towards germline or somatic cells, this is also called a gonosomal mutation. A mutation that arises later in zygote development will be present in a small subset of either somatic or germline cells, but not both.  Causes  = Endogenous factors = A germline mutation often arises due to endogenous factors, like errors in cellular replication and oxidative damage. This damage is rarely repaired imperfectly, but due to the high rate of germ cell division, can occur frequently. Endogenous mutations are more prominent in sperm than in ova. This is because spermatocytes go through a larger number of cell divisions throughout a male’s life, resulting in more replication cycles that could result in a DNA mutation. Errors in maternal ovum also occur, but at a lower rate than in paternal sperm. The types of mutations that occur also tend to vary between the sexes. A mothers’ eggs, after production, remain in stasis until each is utilized in ovulation. This long stasis period has been shown to result in a higher number of chromosomal and large sequence deletions, duplications, insertions, and transversions. The father’s sperm, on the other hand, undergoes continuous replication throughout his lifetime, resulting in many small point mutations that result from errors in replication. These mutations include single base pair deletions, insertions, duplications, and amino acid changes. Oxidative damage is another endogenous factor that can cause germline mutations. This type of damage is caused by reactive oxygen species that build up in the cell as a by-product of cellular respiration. These reactive oxygen species are missing an electron, and because they are highly electronegative (have a strong electron pull) they will rip an electron away from another molecule. This can initiate DNA damage because it causes the nucleic acid guanine to shift to 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This 8-oxoG molecule is then mistaken for a thymine by DNA polymerase during replication, causing a G>T transversion on one DNA strand, and a C>A transversion on the other. = Exogenous factors = A germline mutation can also occur due to exogenous factors. Similar to somatic mutations, germline mutations can be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which damage the DNA of germ cells. This damage can then either be repaired perfectly, and no mutations will be present, or repaired imperfectly, resulting in a variety of mutations. Exogenous mutagens include harmful chemicals and ionizing radiation; the major difference between germline mutations and somatic mutations is that germ cells are not exposed to UV radiation, and thus not often directly mutated in this manner.  Clinical implications  Different germline mutations can affect an individual differently depending on the rest of their genome. A dominant mutation only requires 1 mutated gene to produce the disease phenotype, while a recessive mutation requires both alleles to be mutated to produce the disease phenotype. For example, if the embryo inherits an already mutated allele from the father, and the same allele from the mother underwent an endogenous mutation, then the child will display the disease related to that mutated gene, even though only 1 parent carries the mutant allele. This is only one example of how a child can display a recessive disease while a mutant gene is only carried by one parent. Detection of chromosomal abnormalities can be found in utero for certain diseases by means of blood samples or ultrasound, as well as invasive procedures such as an amniocentesis. Later detection can be found by genome screening. = Cancer = Mutations in tumour suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes can predispose an individual to developing tumours. It is estimated that genetic mutations are involved in 5-10% of cancers. These mutations make a person susceptible to tumour development if the other copy of the oncogene is randomly mutated. These mutations can occur in germ cells, allowing them to be heritable. Individuals who inherit germline mutations in TP53 are predisposed to certain cancer variants because the protein produced by this gene suppresses tumors. Patients with this mutation are also at a risk for Li–Fraumeni syndrome. Other examples include mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, or mutations in MLH1 which predispose to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. = Huntington's disease = Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant mutation in the HTT gene. The disorder causes degradation in the brain, resulting in uncontrollable movements and behavior. The mutation involves an expansion of repeats in the Huntington protein, causing it to increase in size. Patients who have more than 40 repeats will most likely be affected. The onset of the disease is determined by the amount of repeats present in the mutation; the greater the number of repeats, the earlier symptoms of the disease will appear. Because of the dominant nature of the mutation, only one mutated allele is needed for the disease to be in effect. This means that if one parent is infected, the child will have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. This disease does not have carriers because if a patient has one mutation, they will (most likely) be affected. The disease typically has a late onset, so many parents have children before they know they have the mutation. The HTT mutation can be detected through genome screening. = Trisomy 21 = Trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) results from a child having 3 copies of chromosome 21. This chromosome duplication occurs during germ cell formation, when both copies of chromosome 21 end up in the same daughter cell in either the mother or father, and this mutant germ cell participates in fertilization of the zygote. Another, more common way this can occur is during the first cell division event after the formation of the zygote. The risk of Trisomy 21 increases with maternal age with the risk being 1/2000 (0.05%) at age 20 increasing to 1/100 (1%) at age 40. This disease can be detected by non-invasive as well as invasive procedures prenatally. Non-invasive procedures include scanning for fetal DNA through maternal plasma via a blood sample. = Cystic fibrosis = Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes a variety of symptoms and complications, the most common of which is a thick mucus lining in lung epithelial tissue due to improper salt exchange, but can also affect the pancreas, intestines, liver, and kidneys. Many bodily processes can be affected due to the hereditary nature of this disease; if the disease is present in the DNA of both the sperm and the egg, then it will be present in essentially every cell and organ in the body; these mutations can occur initially in the germline cells, or be present in all parental cells. The most common mutation seen in this disease is ΔF508, which means a deletion of the amino acid at the 508 position. If both parents have a mutated CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein, then their children have a 25% of inheriting the disease. If a child has 1 mutated copy of CFTR, they will not develop the disease, but will become a carrier of the disease. The mutation can be detected before birth through amniocentesis, or after birth via prenatal genetic screening.  Current therapies  Many Mendelian disorders stem from dominant point mutations within genes, including cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle-cell anemia, and Tay–Sachs disease. By inducing a double stranded break in sequences surrounding the disease-causing point mutation, a dividing cell can use the non-mutated strand as a template to repair the newly broken DNA strand, getting rid of the disease-causing mutation. Many different genome editing techniques have been used for genome editing, and especially germline mutation editing in germ cells and developing zygotes; however, while these therapies have been extensively studied, their use in human germline editing is limited. = CRISPR/Cas9 editing = The CRISPR editing system is able to target specific DNA sequences and, using a donor DNA template, can repair mutations within this gene. This editing system induces a double stranded break in the DNA, using a guide RNA and effector protein Cas9 to break the DNA backbones at specific target sequences. This system has shown a higher specificity than TALENs or ZFNs due to the Cas9 protein containing homologous (complementary) sequences to the sections of DNA surrounding the site to be cleaved. This broken strand can be repaired in 2 main ways: homologous directed repair (HDR) if a DNA strand is present to be used as a template (either homologous or donor), and if one is not, then the sequence will undergo non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ often results in insertions or deletions within the gene of interest, due to the processing of the blunt strand ends, and is a way to study gene knockouts in a lab setting. This method can be used to repair a point mutation by using the sister chromosome as a template, or by providing a double stranded DNA template with the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery to be used as the repair template. This method has been used in both human and animal models (Drosophila, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis), and current research is being focused on making this system more specific to minimize off-target cleavage sites. = TALEN editing = The TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) genome editing system is used to induce a double-stranded DNA break at a specific locus in the genome, which can then be used to mutate or repair the DNA sequence. It functions by using a specific repeated sequence of an amino acid that is 33-34 amino acids in length. The specificity of the DNA binding site is determined by the specific amino acids at positions 12 and 13 (also called the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD)) of this tandem repeat, with some RVDs showing a higher specificity for specific amino acids over others. One the DNA break is initiated, the ends can either be joined with NHEJ that induces mutations, or by HDR that can fix mutations. = ZFN editing = Similar to TALENs, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are used to create a double stranded break in the DNA at a specific locus in the genome. The ZFN editing complex consists of a zinc finger protein (ZFP) and a restriction enzyme cleavage domain. The ZNP domain can be altered to change the DNA sequence that the restriction enzyme cuts, and this cleavage event initiates cellular repair processes, similar to that of CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing. Compared to CRISPR/Cas9, the therapeutic applications of this technology are limited, due to the extensive engineering required to make each ZFN specific to the desired sequence.

From its construction in 1826 until 1830 the arch stood in a different location nearby; it was moved to its current site in 1882–1883. It originally supported a colossal equestrian statue of the 1st Duke of Wellington by the sculptor Matthew Cotes Wyatt, as a result of which it has acquired the name \\"the Wellington Arch\\" in the vernacular. A bronze quadriga (an ancient four-horse chariot) by Adrian Jones has surmounted it since 1912. History Shepherd's Metropolitan Improvements, was published while the arch was still under construction. Both the Wellington Arch and Marble Arch (originally sited in front of Buckingham Palace) were planned in 1825 by George IV to commemorate Britain's victories in the Napoleonic Wars. During the second half of the 1820s, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the King resolved that Hyde Park, and the area around it, should be renovated to match the splendour of rival European capital cities, and that the essence of the new arrangement would be a triumphal approach to the recently completed Buckingham Palace. The committee of the project, led by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and advised by Charles Arbuthnot, President of the Board of Commissioners of Woods and Forests, selected Decimus Burton as the project's architect. In 1828, when giving evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee on the Government's spending on public works, Arbuthnot explained that he had nominated Burton \\"having seen in the Regent's Park, and elsewhere, works which pleased my eye, from their architectural beauty and correctness\\". Burton intended to create an urban space dedicated to the celebration of the House of Hanover, national pride, and the nation's heroes. The renovation of Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James's Park began in 1825, with the demarcation of new drives and pathways, subsequent to which Burton designed new lodges and gates, viz. Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, the Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, and, later, the Prince of Wales's Gate, Knightsbridge, in the classical style. There were no authoritative precedents for such buildings, which required windows and chimney stacks, in the classical style, and, in the words of Guy Williams, \\"Burton's reticent treatment of the supernumerary features\\" and of the cast iron gates and railings was \\"greatly admired\\". At Hyde Park Corner, the King required \\"some great ceremonial outwork that would be worthy of the new palace that lay to its rear\\", and accepted Burton's consequent proposal for a sequence comprising a gateway and a classical screen, and a triumphal arch, which would enable those approaching Buckingham Palace from the north to ride or drive first through the screen and then through the arch, before turning left to descend Constitution Hill and enter the forecourt of Buckingham Palace through Nash's Marble Arch. The screen became the neoclassical Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, which delighted the King and his Committee, and which the architectural historian Guy Williams describes as \\"one of the most pleasing architectural works that have survived from the neo-classical age\\". The triumphal arch became the Wellington Arch at Constitution Hill into Green Park, London, which has been described as \\"one of London's best loved landmarks\\". Burton's original design for the triumphal arch, which was modelled on the Arch of Titus at Rome, on which the central and side blocks of the Screen had been modelled, was more technically perfect, and coherent with the Screen, than that of the arch that was subsequently built: this original design, however, was rejected by the Committee – who had envisaged a design based on the Arch of Constantine, on which Nash's Marble Arch had been modelled – because it was not sufficiently ostentatious. Burton created a new design, \\"to pander to the majestic ego\\", which was much larger and modelled on a fragment found in the Roman Forum, which was accepted on 14 January 1826, and subsequently built as the present Wellington Arch. The arch has a single opening, and uses the Corinthian order. Much of the intended exterior ornamentation was omitted as a cost-saving exercise necessitated by the King's overspending on the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which was underway at the same time. A contemporary account, written in anticipation of its completion to its original plan, describes what was intended: > The entabulature is loft and elegant with a richly sculptured frieze, and a > row of boldly projecting lions' heads on the cymatium, marking the centres > of columns and other sub-divisions of the order. Above the entablature, on a > lofty blocking course, is raised an attic, the body of which is embellished > with a sculptural representation of an ancient triumph. On each of the > columns is a statue of a warrior, and on the summit of the acroterium which > surmounts the attic is a figure in a quadriga or ancient four horse chariot. = Sculpture of the triumphal arch = Wellington Statue on the Arch in the 1850s The arch at Constitution Hill was left devoid of decorative sculpture as a result of the moratorium in 1828 on public building work, and, instead, despite the absolute objection of Burton, was mounted with an ungainly equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the son of the then recently deceased James Wyatt, who had been selected by statue's commissioner, and one of its few subsequent advocates, Sir Frederick Trench. The bronze by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, which eventually crowned the arch, was, at 40 tons (40.62 tonne) and high, the largest equestrian figure ever made. Matthew Cotes Wyatt was not competent: Guy Williams contends that he were \\"not noticeably talented\\", and the Dictionary of National Biography that \\"thanks to royal and other influential patronage, Wyatt enjoyed a reputation and practice to which his mediocre abilities hardly entitled him\\". Trench, and his patrons the Duke and Duchess of Rutland, had told the public subscribers to the statue that the statue would be place on top of Burton's triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner; Burton expressed his opposition to this proposal \\"as plainly and as vehemently as his nature allowed\\" consistently over successive years, because the ungainly statue would \\"disfigure\\" his arch, for which it was much too large, and the surrounding neighbourhood, because it would have to be placed, contrary to all classical precedent, across, instead of parallel with, the roadway under the arch. Burton had envisaged that his arch would be topped with only a small quadriga whose horses would have been parallel with the road under the arch. Burton's objections were extensively endorsed by most of the aristocratic residents of London. A writer in The Builder asked Lord Canning, the First Commissioner for Woods and Forests, to ban the project: > We have learnt, and can state positively, that Mr. Burton has the strongest > objection possible against placing the group in question on the archway... > and that he is taking no part whatever in the alteration proposed to be made > in the upper part of the structure to prepare it to receive the pedestal... > Mr. Burton, through the mildness which characterizes him, has not expressed > this opinion so loudly and so publicly as he ought to have done.... an > opinion prevails very generally, that he is a party to the proceedings, and > this has induced many to be silent who would otherwise have spoken... The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, contended that another site would be preferable, and proposed, on behalf of the Crown, to offer any other site, but the statue's subscribers rejected all alternative proposals. Every single MP except Sir Frederick Trench wanted the statue to be placed elsewhere. Canning wrote that \\"the remonstrances which reach Her Majesty's Government against the proposed appropriation of the arch are so many and so strong, the representations of its architect, Mr. Burton, in the same sense, are so earnest, and the opinion of every other eminent architect, artist, or other competent authority who has been consulted on the subject is so decided [against the placing of the Wellington statue on the arch]\\". Decimus Burton himself wrote, \\"The arch would, I consider, suffer greatly in importance if the colossal statue in question be placed there, because it would become a mere pedestal. The want of proportion in the proposed surmount, compared with the columns and other details of the architecture, would show that they had been designed by different hands, and without reference for each other. ...I have desired to witness the completion of this building, as originally designed by me, and as approved by the Lords of the Treasury, yet I would prefer that the building should remain for the present in its forlorn and bare state, rather than a colossal equestrian statue should be placed upon it... I fear that if this appropriation of the building should be decided upon, a proposition would soon be made for removing altogether the facades of columns, the slender proportions of which would appear so incongruous and out of proportion compared with the prodigious dimensions of the statue\\". Burton had realized that the disciples of Pugin and advocates of Pugin's anti-classicism would remove all classical elements from his arch if permitted the opportunity to do so. The Government placed the Wellington statue on the arch in autumn 1846; Williams contends that the product was \\"ridiculous\\". The Builder contended, \\"down, unquestionably, it must come. As the network of timber is removed, spar by spar, from before it, so do the folly of the experiment, the absurdity of the conjunction, and the greatness of the sacrifice become apparent. Its effect is even worse than we anticipated – the destruction of the arch by the statue, and of the statue by its elevation on the arch, more complete. Every post brings us letters urging renewed efforts to remove the figure to another site\\". The contestation about the prospective removal of the statue became national. However, the Government failed to remove the statue, despite that they had professed, when it had been placed, that they would do so if it provoked the aversion which it had provoked. Foreign intellectuals who visited London identified the incongruous fusion of the statue and the arch as \\"spectacular confirmation\\" of the \\"artistic ignorance of the English\\". Guy Williams writes that \\"[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now – freer, perhaps, of the 'monstrous carbuncles' so disliked by the present Prince of Wales – if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground\\". The quadriga During 1882, traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner motivated advocacy for Burton's triumphal arch to be moved to the top of Constitution Hill to create space for traffic. In response to this advocacy, Burton's great-nephew Francis Fearon compiled and published a pamphlet that advocated the removal of the Wellington statue from the arch in the event of the removal of the arch to another location: Fearon contended that the arch should be \\"relieved once and for all of its unsightly load\\". The campaign led by Fearon was successful: Wyatt's incongruous statue was removed to Aldershot, and its place on Burton's arch, which was moved to Constitution Hill in 1883, was occupied by a Quadriga by Captain Adrian Jones. Jones' statue is not nearly as elegant as Burton's designed statue intended for the arch, but it is more coherent with the arch than Wyatt's statue, and its figures, unlike those of Wyatt's statue, are aligned with the roadway under the arch. Jones's statue is based on a smaller original which caught the eye of Edward VII at a Royal Academy exhibition. The sculpture depicts Nike, the winged goddess of victory, descending on the chariot of war, holding the classical symbol of victory and honour, a laurel wreath. The face of the charioteer leading the quadriga is that of a small boy (actually the son of Lord Michelham, who funded the sculpture). The angel of peace was modelled on Beatrice Stewart. The statue is the largest bronze sculpture in Europe. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden was moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created; this separated the space containing the Arch from the rest of the Green Park. Public access The arch is hollow inside and until 1992 housed the smallest police station in London. Transferred to the ownership of English Heritage in 1999, it is open to the paying public: three floors of exhibits detailing the history of the arch, an exhibition titled Waterloo 1815: The Battle for Peace and high terraces on both sides of the arch with views of the surrounding area.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1992, and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1991. Connery was educated at Glenlawn Collegiate in St. Vital, Manitoba, and later worked as a market gardener. He was chair of the Root Crop Marketing Board from 1972 to 1981, and vice-president of the Manitoba Producers Board from 1982 to 1984, as well as having been a director of the Vegetable Growers Association of Manitoba. He married Beverley Sager. Connery was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, in the safe Tory seat of Portage la Prairie. The Tories were defeated by the New Democrats under Howard Pawley in this cycle, and Connery became a member of the official opposition. Connery was re-elected in the 1988 election against a reasonably strong challenge from Liberal Darlene Hamm (he still won by over 1000 votes). The Tories under Gary Filmon formed a minority government after this election, and Connery was appointed Minister of Labour and Minister of the Environment and Workplace Safety and Health on May 9, 1988. He was also responsible for the Workers Compensation Act (except as regards Worker Advisers), the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, and the Public Servants Insurance Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on April 21, 1989, he was named Minister of Cooperative, Consumer and Corporate Affairs. Connery was re- elected in the 1990 election. He was not re-appointed to cabinet in a shuffle on February 5, 1991, and resigned from the legislature on June 23, 1992. In leaving, he complained openly about Filmon's government being controlled by backroom operators. In 2003, Connery called for greater efforts to combat crime in the Portage la Prairie region. He was an industry leader in mechanizing the harvesting of carrots, onions and rutabagas, as well as their bulk storage, utilizing air circulation and humidification. He is a strong supporter of agricultural research to solve industry production, storage and marketing problems. His assistance contributed to solving problems related to: surface browning of carrots, neck rot in onions, surface cracking of rutabagas and quality maintenance in broccoli. On July 19, 2007 Connery was inducted into the Manitoba Agricultural Hall of Fame.

The city of Zion was founded by Dowie as a religious community to establish a society on the principles of the Kingdom of God.The History of Christ Community Church , accessed June 2, 2011. Members are sometimes called Zionites (not to be confused with the German Zionites).\\"Christian Catholic Church\\". The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008. Accessed June 2, 2011. Over the years there have been many changes to the church founded by John Alexander Dowie. He was a popular faith healer and started the church and the Zion community with utopian ideals. Under Wilbur Glenn Voliva, Dowie's successor, the church was noted for its adherence to a flat earth cosmology. The succession of pastors after Voliva moved the church back to mainstream Protestant doctrine. In the early 20th century, the Christian Catholic Church had worldwide appeal. The church's magazine, The Leaves of Healing, was distributed in the U.S., Australia, Europe, and southern Africa. At its height, Dowie's movement had some 20,000 adherents.Blumhofer, Edith L. The Assemblies of God: A Chapter in the Story of American Pentecostalism Volume 1—To 1941. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House, 1989. . Pages 31–34. The Zionist Churches of southern Africa trace their spiritual heritage back to Dowie and the Christian Catholic Church.Adrian Hastings, The Church in Africa: 1450–1950. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994 pp. 499–505, 520-521, 537-538 Because of Dowie's emphasis on faith healing and restorationism the church is considered a forerunner of Pentecostalism. The name Christian Catholic Church is still used for Christ Community Church's worldwide fellowship of churches and mission work. As of 2008, it has about 3,000 members in the United States and Canada. Missionary work is conducted in Japan, Philippines, Guyana, Palestine, Indonesia, and the Navajo Nation.World Missions at Christ Community Church , accessed June 2, 2011. Missionary work continues among the African Zionists under the banner of Zion Evangelical Ministries of Africa (ZEMA). ZEMA's goal is to convert the African Zionists from syncretism to mainstream Christian theology.ZEMA , accessed June 2, 2011.  John Alexander Dowie  John Alexander Dowie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, May 25, 1847, to an evangelical family. The family emigrated to Australia in 1860, with Dowie returning to attend the University of Edinburgh from 1867 to 1872, at which time he once more sailed for Australia. In 1876 Dowie married and he began his evangelistic ministry three years later in Melbourne. Dowie emigrated to San Francisco in 1888 where he founded the Ministry of Divine Healing. After years of traveling across the country preaching and healing, he finally settled in Chicago and in 1893 set up a tabernacle at the World's Columbian Exposition. During the next seven years, Dowie founded the Christian Catholic Church that met in several city locations including the Chicago Auditorium (1896). In 1900 he purchased land along the shores of Lake Michigan, north of Chicago near the Illinois–Wisconsin border and founded a religious utopian community that he called Zion. He also founded a commercial enterprise, which came to be called Zion Industries, to support the community. Initially its main product was Scottish lace and it enjoyed considerable success. Dowie proselytized vigorously both in person and by means of several serial publications, chief among them being Leaves of Healing, and gained a lot of adherents. At its height in 1905, the church claimed some 30,000 members worldwide, of whom some 7500 settled in Zion. Two notable features of Dowie's preaching were faith healing and what he called holy living—his followers were admonished to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, pork products, doctors and medicines, the \\"apostate churches\\", etc. Dowie had progressive views on race relations for his day and welcomed blacks into his church, of whom some 200 settled in Zion. He later sent some of them as missionaries to South Africa, where they established churches that became very influential. As the community of Zion grew in size and prosperity, Dowie adopted an increasingly lavish lifestyle, building himself a 25-room mansion and dressing himself in ornate ecclesiastical robes modeled after those worn by Aaron, the high priest, described in Leviticus. Due to this and other financial mismanagement, the church was threatened with bankruptcy. In 1905 Dowie suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes. In 1906 his followers revolted, ousted him from leadership and elected Wilbur Glenn Voliva as the new leader of the church. A splinter group rejected the new leadership, left Zion, and some of them went on to become influential leaders of the budding Pentecostal movement. Dowie died of another stroke on March 9, 1907. A bizarre sidelight on Dowie's later years is that he became embroiled in an acrimonious public dispute with a controversial Indian Muslim religious figure, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. In 1903 they engaged in a widely publicized prayer duel, each calling upon God to punish the other to expose him as a false prophet. Ahmad and his followers proclaimed Dowie's rapidly ensuing illness, disgrace, and death as a vindication of their religious beliefs. Ahmad died in 1908, a year later than Dowie, although he was several years older than Dowie.  Wilbur Glenn Voliva  Wilbur Glenn Voliva succeeded Dowie as General Overseer of Zion in 1906 and renamed the church to \\"Christian Catholic Apostolic Church\\". He kept tight control on his some 6000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. All real estate in Zion, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under an 1100-year lease, subject to many restrictions and subject to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned - visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force. He diversified Zion Industries to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one company town and its workers were paid substandard wages. A strict code of morality was imposed in the town on all persons who set foot inside city limits. It was unlawful for women to wear short dresses, high heels, bathing suits or lipstick. Ham, bacon, oysters, liquor and tobacco were banned, as were drugstores, medical buildings, movie theaters, and globes (as they challenged Voliva's flat-earth cosmology). A ten o'clock curfew was rigidly enforced. You could be arrested for whistling on Sunday. These laws were enforced by Voliva's police force, called the Praetorian Guard, whose helmets carried the word 'PATIENCE' and whose sleeves bore images of doves. Policemen wore Bibles and clubs on their belts. Voliva gained a lot of nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove flat earth theory, but on terms of his own choosing. The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. His 5,000 watt radio station, WCBD, broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution. Like his predecessor Dowie, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the Great Depression, which forced the town's sole employer, Zion Industries, into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in Oberammergau. However, in 1937 a disgruntled employee set the church's huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place, ablaze. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into personal bankruptcy. In 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. Shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942 he died, and the church all but dissolved. A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern but a second fire destroyed the Zion Auditorium on April 11, 1959. At this time the Robson family from England were living in an apartment in the building. They were out of the building at the time. Had they been at home they would have perished, as the fire appliances were not able to reach the fourth floor. This was felt to be God's provision as He kept them out of the building that day. The church in Zion was later renamed to Christ Community Church. References Further reading *Wacker, Grant. \\"Marching to Zion: Religion in a Modern Utopian Community\\".

Lineage  He was born in Etchingham, Sussex, England to Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel (c. 1313–1376), and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster (1318–1372), daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and widow of John, 2nd Baron Beaumont. His brother was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford.  High office  Betchworth Castle John was appointed Lord Marshal of England by Richard II of England in 1377, and summoned to the House of Lords on 4 August 1377, by writ directed Johanni de Arundell. He served as Lord Marshal until 1379. On 26 July 1379 he was given licence to crenellate (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as Betchworth Castle.  Naval victory  Being in command of a naval expedition in aid to the Duke of Brittany, he defeated the French fleet off the coast of Cornwall.  Death at sea  Commanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the Duke of Brittany, Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men \\"took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped\\"Thomas Walsingham, \\"Chronica Maiora\\" those they found inside. Further to this Sir John \\"allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people\\". When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. Thomas Walsingham reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned. According to Thomas Walsingham's story, FitzAlan's men profaned a convent at or near Southampton, and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near Scariff according to some authorities, but at Cape Clear Island according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. Froissart's account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham's, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.  Burial  He was buried in Lewes, Sussex. He was also an ancestor of the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley.  Marriage and children  On 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married Eleanor Maltravers (Mautravers) (1345 - 10 January 1404/1406), daughter of John Maltravers and Gwenthin. They had at least five children (some references list more): *Joan FitzAlan (D' Arundel) (c. 1360 - 1 September 1404.

The Tantramar Marshes also known as the Tintamarre National Wildlife Area is a tidal saltmarsh around the Bay of Fundy on the Isthmus of Chignecto. The area borders between Route 940, Route 16 and Route 2 near Sackville, New Brunswick. At 20,230 hectares, the marsh is one of the largest on the Atlantic coast of North America. The marshes are an important stopover for migrating waterfowl such as semi-palmated sandpipers and Canada geese. Now a National Wildlife Area the marshes are the site of two bird sanctuaries. The name Tantramar is derived from the Acadian French tintamarre, meaning 'din' or 'racket', a reference to the noisy flocks of birds which feed there. The landscape of the Tantramar Marshes has provided subject matter for the poets Charles G.D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, Douglas Lochhead, and Elizabeth Bishop, painter Alex Colville, and photographer Thaddeus Holownia. Communities on or bordering the marshes include, in New Brunswick: Aulac and Sackville, and on the Nova Scotia side: Amherst, and Fort Lawrence. Natural environment The marshes are a broad expanses of flat land just above mean sea level. The soil consists of silts deposited by centuries of tidal flooding. Drainage is poor and there are slow-moving meandering rivers, shallow lakes and bogs, which favours the growth of sedges and tamarack. The marsh's intertidal zones provide a habitat for many species of freshwater and estuarine life. It is drained by the Aulac, LaPlanche, Missaguash, and Tantramar Rivers.  History and economy of the marshes alt= For a full account of human activity on the marshes, see the History of Sackville. Before the arrival of Europeans, well-traveled portage routes connected the Bay of Fundy with the Northumberland Strait. Migrating from Port Royal in around 1671, Acadians established a village in the area (which they called Beaubassin). They founded a number of scattered settlements on higher ground, and created the dykes and sluices which converted the salt marshes to fields and pastures. Following the Battle of Fort Beauséjour which marked the end of the battle for Acadia between the British and French, it was the site of the beginning of the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. Six years later the British resettled the area, and continued to convert the marsh to arable land. As time went on, land ownership became consolidated and a Commission of Sewers was established, which was crucial to the economy. By the mid-1800s, 10,000 hectares was producing grains, root crops, and marsh hay. Once the land was drained, the cost of producing hay was low, Tantramar hay was sold to lumber camps, exploration, and mining in Atlantic Canada and stables as far away as Boston. In the 1930s there were more than 400 post-and- beam hay barns on the marshes, for hay storage. Today there are fewer than 30. The price of hay was $28 per ton in 1920, but as horses were replaced by cars and as manufacturing moved west, the hay price fell to $7 a ton in 1938. The marshes then became pasture, and as their agricultural profitability declined the Canadian Wildlife Service and Ducks Unlimited helped to return the marshes to a more natural state. After 2010 fears emerged that rising sea levels (and deterioration of 18th-century hand-built dikes) threatened to flood the Tantramar Marshes and make Nova Scotia into an island separate from the North American mainland.\\"Nova Scotia could become an island . . .\\" https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dike-tantramar-marsh-flooding- climate-change-rising-sea-levels-amherst-sackville-1.4403406; \\"Rising sea levels threaten marsh ecosystem and key transportation link . . .\\" https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-for- june-14-2020-1.5604357/rising-sea-levels-threaten-marsh-ecosystem-and-key- transportation-link-between-atlantic-provinces-1.5604438. In 1945 Radio Canada International opened a radio transmitter and the site proved to be one of the best shortwave transmitting locations in the world. Shortwave broadcasting ended in 2012 and transmitting towers have since been removed.

In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year- old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, British India, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate. They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai, by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured, and, two weeks after which, died of a heart attack. Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru, a marksman. He was then shot several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police constable, Chanan Singh, who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled. After escaping, Singh and his associates, using pseudonyms, publicly owned to avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters, which, however, they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target. Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and then allowed the authorities to arrest them. The arrest, and the resulting publicity, had the effect of bringing to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, and ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931, aged 23. Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him, \\"Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name.\\" In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in life, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh.  Early life  Bhagat Singh, a Sandhu Jat, was born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB, Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India present day Pakistan. His birth coincided with the release of his father and two uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, from jail. His family members were Hindus and Sikhs; some had been active in Indian Independence movements, others had served in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army. His ancestral village was Khatkar Kalan, near the town of Banga, India in Nawanshahr district (now renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar) of the Punjab. His family was politically active. His grandfather, Arjun Singh followed Swami Dayananda Saraswati's Hindu reformist movement, Arya Samaj, which had a considerable influence on Bhagat. His father and uncles were members of the Ghadar Party, led by Kartar Singh Sarabha and Har Dayal. Ajit Singh was forced into exile due to pending court cases against him while Swaran Singh died at home in Lahore in 1910 following his release from jail. Unlike many Sikhs of his age, Singh did not attend the Khalsa High School in Lahore. His grandfather did not approve of the school officials' loyalty to the British government. He was enrolled instead in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School, an Arya Samaji institution. The Arya Samaj philosophy greatly influenced him throughout his life. In 1919, when he was 12 years old, Singh visited the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hours after thousands of unarmed people gathered at a public meeting had been killed. When he was 14 years old, he was among those in his village who welcomed protesters against the killing of a large number of unarmed people at Gurudwara Nankana Sahib on 20 February 1921. Singh became disillusioned with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence after he called off the non-co-operation movement. Gandhi's decision followed the violent murders of policemen by villagers who were reacting to the police killing three villagers in the 1922 Chauri Chaura incident. Singh joined the Young Revolutionary Movement and began to advocate for the violent overthrow of the British Government in India. In this historical photograph of students and staff of National College, Lahore, Singh can be seen standing fourth from the right. In 1923, Singh joined the National College in Lahore, where he also participated in extra-curricular activities like the dramatics society. In 1923, he won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, writing on the problems in the Punjab. Inspired by the Young Italy movement of Giuseppe Mazzini, he founded the Indian socialist youth organisation Naujawan Bharat Sabha in March 1926. He also joined the Hindustan Republican Association, which had prominent leaders, such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil and Shahid Ashfaqallah Khan. A year later, to avoid an arranged marriage, Singh ran away to Cawnpore. In a letter he left behind, he said: Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party (\\"Workers and Peasants Party\\") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi. He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.  Revolutionary activities  = Lala Lajpat Rai's death and killing of Saunders = In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death. Bhagat was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928. HSRA pamphlet after Saunders' murder, signed by Balraj, a pseudonym of Chandrashekhar Azad Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that: = Escape = After killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V. College entrance, across the road from the District Police Headquarters. Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was fatally injured by Chandrashekhar Azad's covering fire. They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses. The police launched a massive search operation to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and from the city; the CID kept a watch on all young men leaving Lahore. The fugitives hid for the next two days. On 19 December 1928, Sukhdev called on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi, wife of another HSRA member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to provide. They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en route to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning. Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day. Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant. At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore. At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later. = 1929 Assembly incident and arrest= For some time, Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause. The HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat's participation in the bombing because they were certain that his prior involvement in the Saunders shooting meant that his arrest would ultimately result in his execution. However, they eventually decided that he was their most suitable candidate. On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed not to kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan \\"Inquilab Zindabad!\\" (\\"Long Live the Revolution\\") and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi. = Assembly case trial = According to Neeti Nair, associate professor of history, \\"public criticism of this terrorist action was unequivocal.\\" Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their deed. Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a \\"drama\\". Singh and Dutt eventually responded to the criticism by writing the Assembly Bomb Statement: The trial began in the first week of June, following a preliminary hearing in May. On 12 June, both men were sentenced to life imprisonment for: \\"causing explosions of a nature likely to endanger life, unlawfully and maliciously.\\" Dutt had been defended by Asaf Ali, while Singh defended himself. Doubts have been raised about the accuracy of testimony offered at the trial. One key discrepancy concerns the automatic pistol that Singh had been carrying when he was arrested. Some witnesses said that he had fired two or three shots while the police sergeant who arrested him testified that the gun was pointed downward when he took it from him and that Singh \\"was playing with it.\\" According to an article in the India Law Journal, the prosecution witnesses were coached, their accounts were incorrect, and Singh had turned over the pistol himself. Singh was given a life sentence.  Arrest of associates In 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore and Saharanpur. On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal. Not long after this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the conspirators became informants. With the new information available, the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture. Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder.  Hunger strike and Lahore conspiracy case  Singh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal. His life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided. He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued that they should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail. The hunger strike inspired a rise in public support for Singh and his colleagues from around June 1929. The Tribune newspaper was particularly prominent in this movement and reported on mass meetings in places such as Lahore and Amritsar. The government had to apply Section 144 of the criminal code in an attempt to limit gatherings. Jawaharlal Nehru met Singh and the other strikers in Central Jail Mianwali. After the meeting, he stated: Muhammad Ali Jinnah spoke in support of the strikers in the Assembly, saying: The government tried to break the strike by placing different food items in the prison cells to test the prisoners' resolve. Water pitchers were filled with milk so that either the prisoners remained thirsty or broke their strike; nobody faltered and the impasse continued. The authorities then attempted force-feeding the prisoners but this was resisted. With the matter still unresolved, the Indian Viceroy, Lord Irwin, cut short his vacation in Simla to discuss the situation with jail authorities. Since the activities of the hunger strikers had gained popularity and attention amongst the people nationwide, the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the Lahore Conspiracy Case. Singh was transported to Borstal Jail, Lahore, and the trial began there on 10 July 1929. In addition to charging them with the murder of Saunders, Singh and the 27 other prisoners were charged with plotting a conspiracy to murder Scott, and waging a war against the King. Singh, still on hunger strike, had to be carried to the court handcuffed on a stretcher; he had lost from his original weight of since beginning the strike. The government was beginning to make concessions but refused to move on the core issue of recognising the classification of \\"political prisoner\\". In the eyes of officials, if someone broke the law then that was a personal act, not a political one, and they were common criminals. By now, the condition of another hunger striker, Jatindra Nath Das, lodged in the same jail, had deteriorated considerably. The Jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the government rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail. On 13 September 1929, Das died after a 63-day hunger strike. Almost all the nationalist leaders in the country paid tribute to Das' death. Mohammad Alam and Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned from the Punjab Legislative Council in protest, and Nehru moved a successful adjournment motion in the Central Assembly as a censure against the \\"inhumane treatment\\" of the Lahore prisoners. Singh finally heeded a resolution of the Congress party, and a request by his father, ending his hunger strike on 5 October 1929 after 116 days. During this period, Singh's popularity among common Indians extended beyond Punjab. Singh's attention now turned to his trial, where he was to face a Crown prosecution team comprising C. H. Carden-Noad, Kalandar Ali Khan, Jai Gopal Lal, and the prosecuting inspector, Bakshi Dina Nath. The defence was composed of eight lawyers. Prem Dutt Verma, the youngest amongst the 27 accused, threw his slipper at Gopal when he turned and became a prosecution witness in court. As a result, the magistrate ordered that all the accused should be handcuffed. Singh and others refused to be handcuffed and were subjected to brutal beating. The revolutionaries refused to attend the court and Singh wrote a letter to the magistrate citing various reasons for their refusal. The magistrate ordered the trial to proceed without the accused or members of the HSRA. This was a setback for Singh as he could no longer use the trial as a forum to publicise his views.  Special Tribunal  To speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This decision cut short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located in England. On 2 July 1930, a habeas corpus petition was filed in the High Court challenging the ordinance on the grounds that it was ultra vires and, therefore, illegal; the Viceroy had no powers to shorten the customary process of determining justice. The petition argued that the Defence of India Act 1915 allowed the Viceroy to introduce an ordinance, and set up such a tribunal, only under conditions of a breakdown of law-and-order, which, it was claimed in this case, had not occurred. However, the petition was dismissed as being premature. Carden-Noad presented the government's charges of conducting robberies, and the illegal acquisition of arms and ammunition among others. The evidence of G. T. H. Hamilton Harding, the Lahore superintendent of police, shocked the court. He stated that he had filed the first information report against the accused under specific orders from the chief secretary to the governor of Punjab and that he was unaware of the details of the case. The prosecution depended mainly on the evidence of P. N. Ghosh, Hans Raj Vohra, and Jai Gopal who had been Singh's associates in the HSRA. On 10 July 1930, the tribunal decided to press charges against only 15 of the 18 accused and allowed their petitions to be taken up for hearing the next day. The trial ended on 30 September 1930. The three accused, whose charges were withdrawn, included Dutt who had already been given a life sentence in the Assembly bomb case. The ordinance (and the tribunal) would lapse on 31 October 1930 as it had not been passed by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its 300-page judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the participation of Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in Saunder's murder was proven. They were sentenced to death by hanging. Of the other accused, three were acquitted (Ajoy Ghosh, Jatindra Nath Sanyal and Des Raj), Kundan Lal received seven years' rigorous imprisonment, Prem Dutt received five years of the same, and the remaining seven (Kishori Lal, Mahabir Singh, Bijoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Verma, Gaya Prasad, Jai Dev and Kamalnath Tewari) were all sentenced to transportation for life.  Appeal to the Privy Council  In Punjab province, a defence committee drew up a plan to appeal to the Privy Council. Singh was initially against the appeal but later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularise the HSRA in Britain. The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the tribunal was invalid while the government countered that the Viceroy was completely empowered to create such a tribunal. The appeal was dismissed by Judge Viscount Dunedin.  Reactions to the judgement  After the rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president Madan Mohan Malviya filed a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February 1931. Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene. In his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded: The Communist Party of Great Britain expressed its reaction to the case: A plan to rescue Singh and fellow HSRA inmates from the jail failed. HSRA member Durga Devi's husband, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, attempted to manufacture bombs for the purpose, but died when they exploded accidentally. = Execution = thumb Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired. The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about from Ferozepore.  Criticism of the tribunal trial  Singh's trial has been described by the Supreme Court as \\"contrary to the fundamental doctrine of criminal jurisprudence\\" because there was no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves. The Special Tribunal was a departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain. The accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed ex-parte. The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy to form the Special Tribunal, was never approved by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament, and it eventually lapsed without any legal or constitutional sanctity.  Reactions to the executions  Front page of The Tribune announcing the executions of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev by the British. The executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party at Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted \\"Down with Gandhi\\". The New York Times reported: Hartals and strikes of mourning were called. The Congress party, during the Karachi session, declared: In the issue of Young India of 29 March 1931, Gandhi wrote:  Gandhi controversy  There have been suggestions that Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Singh's execution but refrained from doing so. Another theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed. In contrast, Gandhi's supporters argue that he did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it, but claim that he did his best to save Singh's life. They also assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead. Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism. He also stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and for that matter, capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. Of Singh's execution Gandhi said: \\"The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.\\" Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: \\"I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life, because he alone gives it.\\" Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931. In a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would arrive too late. Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said:  Ideals and opinions  =Communism= Singh's regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, the founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero. Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party. Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism. He was an avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. In his last testament, \\"To Young Political Workers\\", he declares his ideal as the \\"Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis\\". Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another. From May to September 1928, Singh published a series of articles on anarchism in Kirti. He was concerned that the public misunderstood the concept of anarchism, writing that: \\"The people are scared of the word anarchism. The word anarchism has been abused so much that even in India revolutionaries have been called anarchist to make them unpopular.\\" He clarified that anarchism refers to the absence of a ruler and abolition of the state, not the absence of order. He went on to say: \\"I think in India the idea of universal brotherhood, the Sanskrit sentence vasudhaiva kutumbakam etc., has the same meaning.\\" He believed that: On January 21, 1930, during the trial of the Lahore Conspiracy Case, Bhagat Singh and his HSRA comrades, appeared in the court wearing red scarves. When the magistrate took his chair, they raised slogans \\"Long Live Socialist Revolution\\", \\"Long Live Communist International\\", \\"Long Live People\\" \\"Lenin's Name Will Never Die\\", and \\"Down with Imperialism\\". Bhagat Singh then read the text of a telegram in the court and asked the magistrate to send it to the Third International. The telegram stated: Historian K. N. Panikkar described Singh as one of the early Marxists in India. The political theorist Jason Adams notes that he was more enamoured with Lenin than with Marx. From 1926 onward, he studied the history of the revolutionary movements in India and abroad. In his prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in reference to imperialism and capitalism and also the revolutionary thoughts of Trotsky. On the day his execution, Bhagat Singh was reading the book, Reminiscences of Lenin, authored by Clara Zetkin, a German Marxist. When asked what his last wish was, Singh replied that he was studying the life of Lenin and he wanted to finish it before his death. In spite of his belief in Marxist ideals however, Singh never joined the Communist Party of India. Singh joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). = Atheism = Singh began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu–Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement. He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the British, could be at each other's throats because of their religious differences. At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries' struggle for independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky – all atheist revolutionaries. He also took an interest in Soham Swami's book Common Sense. While in prison in 1930–31, Bhagat Singh was approached by Randhir Singh, a fellow inmate, and a Sikh leader who would later found the Akhand Kirtani Jatha. According to Bhagat Singh's close associate Shiva Verma, who later compiled and edited his writings, Randhir Singh tried to convince Bhagat Singh of the existence of God, and upon failing berated him: \\"You are giddy with fame and have developed an ego that is standing like a black curtain between you and God\\". In response, Bhagat Singh wrote an essay entitled \\"Why I am an Atheist\\" to address the question of whether his atheism was born out of vanity. In the essay, he defended his own beliefs and said that he used to be a firm believer in the Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their hearts.On Bhagat Singh's death anniversary: 'Why I am an atheist'. scroll.in (23 March 2015) He acknowledged the fact that religion made death easier, but also said that unproven philosophy is a sign of human weakness. In this context, he noted: Towards the end of the essay, Bhagat Singh wrote: = \\"Killing the ideas\\" = In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 9 April 1929, he stated: \\"It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived.\\" While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging. Prannath Mehta, Singh's friend, visited him in the jail on 20 March, four days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.  Reception  Singh was criticised both by his contemporaries, and by people after his death, for his violent and revolutionary stance towards the British as well as his strong opposition to the pacifist stance taken by Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. The methods he used to convey his message, such as shooting Saunders, and throwing non-lethal bombs, stood in stark contrast to Gandhi's non-violent methodology, however Gandhi condemned the act of violence but he still considered him to be a great patriot and martyr.  Popularity  Rewalsar, Himachal Pradesh. Subhas Chandra Bose said that: \\"Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths.\\" Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: \\"He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field ... he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere\\". Four years after Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace Williamson, wrote: \\"His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr. Gandhi himself\\".  Legacy and memorials  Then the President, Pratibha Patil honoring the renowned Sculptor, Ram V. Sutar who prepared the statue of Bhagat Singh, which is unveiled at the Parliament House of India, in New Delhi on August 15, 2008. Singh on a 1968 stamp of India Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day. His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it. Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialised in the study of federalism, nationalism and development in India, notes that * On 15 August 2008, an 18-foot tall bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India, next to the statues of Indira Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose. A portrait of Singh and Dutt also adorns the walls of the Parliament House. The National Martyrs Memorial, built at Hussainiwala in memory of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru * The place where Singh was cremated, at Hussainiwala on the banks of the Sutlej river, became Pakistani territory during the partition. On 17 January 1961, it was transferred to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks. Batukeshwar Dutt was cremated there on 19 July 1965 in accordance with his last wishes, as was Singh's mother, Vidyawati. The National Martyrs Memorial was built on the cremation spot in 1968 and has memorials of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. During the 1971 India–Pakistan war, the memorial was damaged and the statues of the martyrs were removed by the Pakistani Army. They have not been returned but the memorial was rebuilt in 1973. * The Shaheedi Mela (Punjabi: Martyrdom Fair) is an event held annually on 23 March when people pay homage at the National Martyrs Memorial. The day is also observed across the Indian state of Punjab. * The Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Museum opened on the 50th anniversary of his death at his ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan. Exhibits include Singh's ashes, the blood-soaked sand, and the blood-stained newspaper in which the ashes were wrapped. A page of the first Lahore Conspiracy Case's judgement in which Kartar Singh Sarabha was sentenced to death and on which Singh put some notes is also displayed, as well as a copy of the Bhagavad Gita with Bhagat Singh's signature, which was given to him in the Lahore Jail, and other personal belongings. * The Bhagat Singh Memorial was built in 2009 in Khatkar Kalan at a cost of . * The Supreme Court of India established a museum to display landmarks in the history of India's judicial system, displaying records of some historic trials. The first exhibition that was organised was the Trial of Bhagat Singh, which opened on 28 September 2007, on the centenary celebrations of Singh's birth. = Modern days = Statues of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev at the India–Pakistan Border, near Hussainiwala The youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh. He was voted the \\"Greatest Indian\\" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi. During the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals. The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 23 March 2001 and 2005. In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk. This change was successfully challenged in a Pakistani court. On 6 September 2015, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk.  Films and television  Several films have been made portraying the life and times of Singh. The first film based on his life was Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh (1954) in which Prem Abeed played the role of Singh followed by Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor as Bhagat Singh, Shaheed (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh and Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays Singh. Three films about Singh were released in 2002 Shaheed-E- Azam, 23 March 1931: Shaheed and The Legend of Bhagat Singh in which Singh was portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn respectively. Siddharth played the role of Bhagat singh in the 2006 film Rang De Basanti, a film drawing parallels between revolutionaries of Bhagat Singh's era and modern Indian youth. Gurdas Mann played the role of Singh in Shaheed Udham Singh, a film based on life of Udham Singh. Karam Rajpal portrayed Bhagat Singh in Star Bharat's television series Chandrashekhar, which is based on life of Chandra Shekhar Azad. In 2008, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) and Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), a non-profit organisation, co-produced a 40-minute documentary on Bhagat Singh entitled Inqilab, directed by Gauhar Raza.  Theatre  Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru have been the inspiration for a number of plays in India and Pakistan, that continue to attract crowds.  Songs  Although, the patriotic Hindustani songs, \\"Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna\\" (\\"The desire to sacrifice\\") created by Bismil Azimabadi, and \\"Mera Rang De Basanti Chola\\" (\\"O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring\\") created by Ram Prasad Bismil, are largely associated with Singh and have been used in a number of related films.  Other  In 1968, a postage stamp was issued in India commemorating the 61st birth anniversary of Singh. A ₹5 coin commemorating him was released for circulation in 2012.

It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law. The precise meaning of universalizability is contentious, but the most common interpretation is that the categorical imperative asks whether the maxim of your action could become one that everyone could act upon in similar circumstances. An action is morally acceptable if it can be universalized (i.e., everyone could do it). For instance, one can determine whether a maxim of lying to secure a loan is moral by attempting to universalize it and applying reason to the results. If everyone lied to secure loans, the very practices of promising and lending would fall apart, and the maxim would then become impossible. Kant calls such acts examples of a contradiction in conception, which is much like a performative contradiction, because they undermine the very basis for their existence. Kant's notion of universalizability has a clear antecedent in Rousseau's idea of a general will. Both notions provide for a radical separation of will and nature, leading to the idea that true freedom lies substantially in self-legislation.

An example of naturalism and local color of California during the first half of the nineteenth century, \\"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\\" was first published in January 1869 in the magazine Overland Monthly. It was one of two short stories which brought the author national attention. Plot summary The story takes place in a Californian community known as Poker Flat, near the town of La Porte. Poker Flat is, in the opinions of many, on a downward slope. The town has lost thousands of dollars, and has experienced a moral decline. In an effort to save what is left of the town and reestablish it as a \\"virtuous\\" place, a secret society is created to decide whom to exile and whom to kill. On November 23rd of 1850, four \\"immoral\\" individuals are exiled from Poker Flat. The first of them is a professional poker player, John Oakhurst. He is among those sent away because of his great success in winning from those on the secret committee. On his way out of town, he is joined by The Duchess, a saloon girl; Mother Shipton, a madam; and Uncle Billy, the town drunk and a suspected robber. These four set out for a camp which is a day's journey away, over a mountain range. Once halfway there, all exiles other than Oakhurst decide to stop at noon for a rest, against Oakhurst's wishes. While on their rest, the group is met by a pair of runaway lovers on their way to Poker Flat to get married. Piney Woods is a fifteen- year-old girl. Her lover, Tom Simson, known also as \\"the Innocent\\", met Oakhurst before and has great admiration for him, as Oakhurst won a great deal of money from Tom. Oakhurst returned the money and pressed upon Tom that the latter should never play poker again, as he was a terrible player. Nonetheless, Tom is thrilled to have come upon Oakhurst on this day, and decides that he and Piney will stay with the group for a while. They do not know that the group is one of exiles; 'innocent' as they are, they are convinced The Duchess is an actual duchess, and so on. A decision is made for everyone to stay the night together. Tom leads the group to a half-butty cabin he discovered, where they spend the night. In the middle of the night, Oakhurst wakes up and sees a heavy snowstorm raging. Looking about, he realizes that he is the only one awake, but soon discovers someone had awoken before him: Uncle Billy is missing, with the group's mules and horses stolen. They are all now forced to wait out the storm with provisions that will likely only last for another 10 days. After a week in the cabin, Mother Shipton dies, having secretly and altruistically starved herself for young Piney. Oakhurst fashions some snowshoes for Simson to go for help, telling the others he will accompany the young man part of the way to Poker Flat. The \\"law of Poker Flat\\" finally arrives at the cabin, only to find the dead Duchess and Piney, embracing in a peaceful repose. They look so peaceful and innocent that the onlookers cannot tell which is the virgin and which is the madam. Oakhurst has committed suicide. He is found dead beneath a tree with his Derringer's bullet in his heart. There is a playing card, the two of clubs, pinned to the tree above his head with a note: > BENEATH THIS TREE LIES THE BODY OF JOHN OAKHURST, WHO STRUCK A STREAK OF BAD > LUCK ON THE 23rd OF NOVEMBER, 1850, AND HANDED IN HIS CHECKS ON THE 7TH > DECEMBER, 1850. Characters * John Oakhurst One of the story's heroes, Oakhurst is occasionally frank but kind in motivation. He is chivalrous, insisting upon switching his good riding horse Five Spot for the mule of the Duchess and refusing to use vulgar language. Another instance of his good nature is: \\"'Tommy, you're a good little man, but you can't gamble worth a cent. Don't try it ever again.' He then handed him back his money back, [and] pushed him gently from the room\\". Oakhurst is not a drinker. He is cool tempered, even keeled and has a calm manner about him. He believes in luck and fate. His suicide spurs the question whether he was simply giving in to his bad luck or rather, decided he was no longer going to live by luck and took his life. * The Duchess, a young woman. * Mother Shipton, another woman. * Uncle Billy, a \\"suspected sluice-robber and confirmed drunkard\\". * Piney, a \\"a stout, comely damsel of fifteen\\".

Description Middle Spring in the Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge at the northeast corner of the Fish Springs Range Several small mountain ranges occupy the edges of the desert, such as the Cedar Mountains, Lakeside Mountains, Silver Island Mountains, Hogup Mountains, Grassy Mountains, and Newfoundland Mountains. On the western edge of the desert, just across the border in Nevada, stands Pilot Peak in the Pilot Range. The desert is cool during the winter and includes unusual plants adapted to the dry conditions. Most of the desert receives less than of annual precipitation. The salt crust covering the desert reforms each year when the rain evaporates. The military's Utah Test and Training Range is in the northern portion of the desert. The lowest part of Juab County is located just south of the Dugway Proving Grounds, about northwest of the northwest corner of the Fish Springs Range. History View of the desert from an airplane During Jedediah Smith's 1826-27 expedition, Robert Evans died in the desert and in the 1840s, westward emigrants used the Hastings Cutoff through of Great Salt Lake desert to reduce the distance to California. The 1846 Donner Party's difficulties in making the crossing contributed to their becoming snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Howard Stansbury explored the desert in 1849. In 1956, I-80 replaced the Wendover Cut-off across the desert, including a straight east-west section for ~ between the Cedar Mountains to the east and Wendover on the Utah/Nevada border. Following a railway completed across the desert's Bonneville Salt Flats in 1910, the flats were first used as a speedway in 1914. The world records for highest land speeds are regularly broken here. Climate The Great Salt Lake Desert experiences a desert climate with hot summers and cold winters. The desert is an excellent example of a cold desert climate. The desert's elevation, 4,250 feet above sea level, makes temperatures cooler than lower elevation deserts, such as the Mojave. Due to the high elevation and aridity, temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Summer nights are comfortably cool. Winter highs are generally above freezing, and winter nights are bitterly cold, with temperatures often dropping well below freezing.

It remains the only double deck train ever to have run in Melbourne. The train's name stood for \\"Double Deck Development and Demonstration.\\"http://vicsig.net/index.php?page=suburban&section;=4d Depending on sources, the intention was for this train to be the demonstration unit for a future order of either 20 or 50 extra sets, had the tests been successful.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3380889439405&set;=a.1192189123265.2030430.1184504348&type;=3&comment;_id=10210023382839516&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D Design left Built by A Goninan & Co, Broadmeadow it was delivered by rail in December 1991.\\"Interstate Rolling Stock\\" Railway Digest February 1992 page 73 Funding for the train was supplied from both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments. The train's design was based on the Tangara train being built by A Goninan & Co for CityRail in Sydney, however it was similar only in terms of interior and exterior bodywork; the train's electrical system was much closer to that of the Comeng sets. The design was further modified for use on Melbourne's broad gauge track, and its control system was designed specifically to allow in-service coupling and operation with Comeng sets.4D train Vicsig In addition, the individual carriages were narrower and shorter in both length and width against their predecessors, to fit the Melbourne loading gauge. It was manufactured from stainless steel, fitted with air- conditioning, tinted windows, and inter-car doors allowing passengers to access all carriages of the train. Much of the equipment matched Sydney's Tangara fleet, from the traction motors (8x MB 3303B) down to small fittings like console buttons. The four-car set had a total passenger capacity of 974 passengers (346 seated and 628 standing); considerably more than a three-car Comeng train of similar length, which would only hold 763 passengers in crush load conditions, including 263 seated. However, the set had about the same seating capacity as a Tait train - 10 seats per compartment, 34 compartments per four-carriage set, with no data available on crush loads. As part of the trial, the Belgrave and Lilydale lines were selected as main testing grounds for the unit and necessary works were performed to accommodate the train's somewhat unconventional dimensions. It was known that the train was physically too large for the Jolimont tunnel between Jolimont and West Richmond railway stations on the Hurstbridge and Epping lines. Given that the train was a demonstrator, it was likely that production designs or future infrastructure plans would have dealt with this. By early 1993 the Victorian Government had decided not to proceed with the acquisition of any further double deck trains deciding infrastructure changes required to accommodate the larger trains were too expensive.\\"Melbourne abandons double deck plans\\" Railway Digest March 1993 page 84 Service The unit broke from Melbourne tradition by being configured as Driving Trailer-Motor-Motor-Driving Trailer (D-TM-TM-D); all other sets in service at the time were (and are still) configured as Driving Motor-Trailer-Driving Motor (M-T-M). In a further break from tradition, the 4D did not use the 'D' code for a driving trailer, instead it was coded simply as T-M-M-T. The car numbers were also placed far outside the usual range; the 4D was numbered as 6000T-5000M-5002M-6002T. Most of the time the 4D was on the rails it was parked in the stabling facilities at Bayswater on the Belgrave line. It entered revenue service on 10 March 1992 after testing and a subsequent media launch. Eight trips were scheduled for its first day in service, the first being the 08:36 service from Flinders Street to Box Hill, followed by the 09:08 return, on which the train suffered the first of its many failures. This required the train to be removed from service at Camberwell and the cancellation of the remaining trips. Initially the 4D was run coupled to a 3-car Comeng set until 1996 when, after a troubled conversion to driver-only operation, it was permitted to operate on its own. Often as not, though, it was towed or pushed by a 3 or 6-car Comeng set following a failure. When the suburban system was split into two in 1998 in preparation for privatisation, it was allocated to Hillside Trains, which became Connex. Throughout its 10 years in Melbourne, the 4D continued to be plagued by reliability issues that saw it constantly in and out of service. After its disappointing entry to service, the train saw little use and was in storage by 1999. It was revived in June 2000, but lasted only a year. A final attempt was made in February 2002 to return the set to service, but after three days it again failed and was placed back in storage, never to operate in revenue service again.Vicsig photo: \\"The 4D lasted 3 days in service during 2002.

Unlike other New South Wales electrified rolling stock, the 4D would have been thin enough to operate through the Ten Tunnels on the Zig Zag route, which were built before John Bradfield introduced his wider loading gauge for the Sydney suburban system.

Early life Thomas was born in Cairo, Georgia on December 3, 1949. He was inspired to pursue a career in music after travelling to Atlanta with longtime childhood friends Charles Connell and Tommy Verran to see a Beatles performance in 1965. Thomas, Connell, and Verran formed their first band together; Verran was the lead vocalist. They disbanded while attending different colleges, but later reformed in the early 1970s along with friend Bud Thomas as the Jets. Thomas was the vocalist for the Lords of London, a garage band from Douglas, Georgia for a brief time, along with guitarist Billy Folsom, bassist Bob Hutchinson, keyboardist Billy Corbi, and drummer Troy Blasingame. Career =Elvin Bishop Group= While singing lead for the Jets in 1974, Thomas joined the Elvin Bishop Group as a backing vocalist and eventually made it to lead vocals. He sang lead vocals on the 1975 Elvin Bishop single \\"Silent Night\\" and the 1976 single \\"Spend Some Time,\\" but his best known achievement was singing on Elvin Bishop's chart hit \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\\", a #3 single in 1976. Performance in Boston touring as Starship featuring Mickey Thomas, on June 16, 2012 =Jefferson Starship & Starship= Thomas recorded the solo album As Long as You Love Me in 1976. After leaving the Elvin Bishop Group, he recorded three songs for the 1978 film Skateboard, which also featured a cameo by Jefferson Starship guitarist Craig Chaquico. In April 1979, Thomas was asked to join that group after the departure of Marty Balin and Grace Slick. In 1981 he recorded his second solo album, Alive Alone. Former Elvin Bishop Group drummer Donny Baldwin became drummer for Jefferson Starship two years later when Aynsley Dunbar left. Thomas spent most of the early 1980s as the main vocalist of Jefferson Starship, performing several duets with Slick (who rejoined in 1981) and gaining greater influence in the band. After Paul Kantner left in 1984, Thomas was leader of the band. Kantner sued over the name of Jefferson Starship, and the settlement left the band with the name Starship. From 1985 until 1989 the band had three #1 hit songs. When Slick left again in 1988, Thomas sang all lead vocals. The 1989 \\"Love Among the Cannibals\\" tour was postponed after Baldwin attacked Thomas in a bar. The damage was such that it required facial reconstruction surgery. Baldwin resigned after the incident. =Starship featuring Mickey Thomas= Starship featuring Mickey Thomas in 2010 Starship was let go by their record label RCA and became inactive in 1991. In early 1992, Mickey Thomas revived Starship as Starship featuring Mickey Thomas and touring has continued with this title. The band's Loveless Fascination was released on September 17, 2013. The band performed at the Streamy Awards on September 8, 2014.\\"Starship Tweet Re Streamys , twitter.com =Other work= He was credited as performing a scat vocal on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album, The Dirt Band.

In 1986, he recorded the song \\"Stand in the Fire\\" for the Rob Lowe hockey movie Youngblood. Thomas recorded the title song for the 1989 film Sing. He appeared in the 1989 film Dream a Little Dream and recorded the film's title song and its duet version with Mel Tormé for the soundtrack. The duet version was also played during the end of the film. In 1987 Thomas recorded \\"Only the Fool Survives\\" with Donna Summer for her album All Systems Go. Their duet was released as the album's second single. In 1996, Thomas performed the opening theme for the Mighty Ducks animated series. In 1997 he guested on Sammy Hagar's album Marching to Mars. In 2002, Starship featuring Mickey Thomas re-recorded a selection of the Starship and Jefferson Starship hits on which he had appeared. The resulting album was released in 2003 as Forever Gold, part of a series of releases by St. Clair Entertainment Group. These recordings have been licensed to several labels, resulting in the release of Starship – Greatest Hits (Delta Records) and Starship – Greatest Hits (Brilliant Records). The original release of these recordings was as Starship – Greatest and Latest, available outside the U.S. only, and including both a CD and DVD. In 2004 he released an album project, under the title of Over the Edge, produced by Fabrizio Grossi. In 2008 he recorded a new album with Aynsley Dunbar for Direct Music, featuring artists such as Jake E. Lee, former guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne. Thomas reunited with Elvin Bishop when Starship closed for them in late 2008. In November 2010, Thomas announced on his website that a new Starship album, Loveless Fascination, would be released in late summer or early fall of 2011; the album was eventually released in September 2013. In July 2011, Thomas released Marauder, a solo project covering songs originally recorded by other artists.

While in Olympic Gold points were awarded according to the medals table, in Winter Olympics they were given according to the best results, like decathlon. Doing so, it was perfectly possible to someone win the gold medal in short track, and get few more points than other skaters (even not finalists) that got better qualifying times. This scoring method also meant that someone who won gold medals in six or seven events might fall outside the top 10 if disqualified on the remaining three. Differences There are many differences between the versions released for each system. Although that could be explained by different hardware, as of 1993 it was possible to make a sprite-based video game on a 16 bit console using the PC version as a base. In this case, differences were due to US Gold's choice to use two companies developing different versions of the game separately and also to the development methodology of Tiertex, who used a different game programmer for each platform – each one programming in a different assembly language (no porting). Amongst major differences, freestyle moguls are different on the 16-bit versions, and overall the Super NES version is much more unforgiving than the Mega Drive/Genesis version, while the Master System version is the one allowing better control on alpine skiing events.

SEBIN is an internal security force subordinate to the Vice President of Venezuela since 2012 and is dependent on Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. SEBIN has been described as the political police force of the Bolivarian government.    History The Venezuelan intelligence agency has an extensive record of human rights violations, including recent allegations of torture and murder of political opponents. =Predecessors= The predecessor of SEBIN was established in March 1969 with the name of DISIP, Dirección Nacional de los Servicios de Inteligencia y Prevención (\\"National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services\\"), by then-president Rafael Caldera, replacing the Dirección General de Policía (DIGEPOL). Human Rights Watch wrote in 1993 that DISIP was involved in targeting political dissenters within Venezuela and was involved in abusive tactics. In their 1997 and 1998 reports, Amnesty International also detailed human rights violations by DISIP, including unlawful detention of Venezuelan human rights activists.1997 AI Report 1998 AI Report =Bolivarian Revolution= El Helicoide, the first headquarters of SEBIN In 1999, President Hugo Chávez began the restructuring of DISIP, with commanders and analysts being selected for their political attributes and rumors of some armed civilian groups gaining credentials from such actions. A retired SEBIN commissioner explained that there began to be \\"biased and incomplete reports, tailored to the new ears, that began to proliferate and ultimately affects the ability of the institution to process information and know what happens\\". On December 4, 2009, President Chávez, during a swearing-in ceremony for the high command of the recently created Bolivarian National Police (Policía Nacional Bolivariana), announced the change of name of DISIP, with immediate effect, to Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia, or SEBIN).Venezuelan Disip to be now designated as Bolivarian Intelligence Service. ABN Accessed on December 4th, 2009 The restructuring of SEBIN was completed in 2013 with one of its goals to guarantee the \\"continuity and consolidation of the Bolivarian Revolution in power\\". In the beginning of the 2014–15 Venezuelan protests, SEBIN agents open fire on protesters which resulted in the deaths of two and the dismissal of Brigadier General Manuel Gregorio Bernal Martinez days later. Under the Nicolas Maduro presidency, a building that was originally intended to be a subway station and offices in Plaza Venezuela was converted into the headquarters for SEBIN. Dubbed \\"La Tumba\\", or \\"The Tomb\\", by Venezuelan officials, political prisoners are allegedly held five stories underground in inhumane conditions at below freezing temperatures and with no ventilation, sanitation, or daylight. The cells are two by three meters that have a cement bed, security cameras and barred doors, with each cell aligned next to one another so there are no interactions between prisoners. Such conditions have caused prisoners to become very ill though they are denied medical treatment. Denounces of torture in \\"The Tomb\\", specifically white torture, are also common, with some prisoners attempting to commit suicide. Such conditions according to NGO Justice and Process are to force prisoners to plead guilty to crimes they are accused of. Domestic actions =Media= According to El Nacional, SEBIN had raided facilities of reporters and human rights defenders several times. It was also stated that SEBIN occasionally intimidated reporters by following them in unmarked vehicles where SEBIN personnel would \\"watch their homes and offices, the public places like bakeries and restaurants, and would send them text messages to their cell phones\\". Following the Narcosobrinos incident which saw President Maduro's nephews arrested in the United States for drug trafficking, Associated Press reporter Hannah Dreier, who had been awarded for her reporting on Venezuela, was detained by SEBIN agents in Sabaneta, Barinas. SEBIN agents threatened her during an interrogation, saying they would behead her like ISIL did to James Foley and said that they would let her go for a kiss. Finally, agents said that they wanted to coerce the United States to exchange Maduro's nephews for Dreier, accusing her of being a spy and sabotaging the Venezuelan economy. =Public surveillance= CONATEL, William Castillo Bolle, giving information of Venezuelan Twitter users to SEBIN General Commissioner Gustavo González López In an El Nuevo Herald, former SEBIN officials and security experts state that the Venezuelan government has allegedly spent millions of dollars to spy on Venezuelans; using Italian and Russian technology to monitor emails, keywords and telephone conversations of its citizens; especially those who use the dominant, state-controlled telecommunications provider CANTV. Acquired information is used to create a \\"person of interest\\" for Venezuelan authorities, where only selected individuals could have been fully spied on and where a database had been created to monitor those who publicly disagreed with the Bolivarian Revolution. In 2014, multiple Twitter users were arrested and faced prosecution due to the tweets they made. , executive director of the Venezuelan Penal Forum (FPV), stated that the arrests of Twitter users in Venezuela was a measure to instill fear among those using social media that were critical against the government. In October 2014, eight Venezuelans were arrested shortly after the death of PSUV official Robert Serra. Though the eight Venezuelans were arrested in October 2014, the Venezuelan government had been monitoring them since June 2014 according to leaked documents, with the state telecommunications agency Conatel providing IP addresses and other details to the Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBIN in order to arrest Twitter users. Surveillance on Jewish community In January 2013, 50 documents were leaked by Analisis24 showing that SEBIN had been collecting \\"private information on prominent Venezuelan Jews, local Jewish organizations and Israeli diplomats in Latin America\\". Some info that was gathered by SEBIN operations included office photos, home addresses, passport numbers and travel itineraries. The leaked documents were believed to be authentic according to multiple sources which included the Anti-Defamation League, that stated, \\"It is chilling to read reports that the SEBIN received instructions to carry out clandestine surveillance operations against members of the Jewish community\\". =Protest suppression= 2004 Venezuela recall protests In March 2004, Amnesty International stated in a report following 2004 Venezuela recall protests that SEBIN (then DISIP) \\"allegedly used excessive force to control the situation on a number of occasions\\". 2014–17 Venezuelan protests alt= Seven SEBIN members caused the first deaths of the 2014–15 Venezuelan protests on 12 February 2014 after shooting at unarmed, fleeing, protesters several times in violation of protocol, which resulted in the deaths of Bassil Da Costa and Juan Montoya. Days later, on February 17, armed SEBIN agents raided the headquarters of Popular Will in Caracas and held individuals who were inside at gunpoint. Following alleged human rights violations by SEBIN during the protests, U.S. President Barack Obama used powers granted from the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 and ordered the United States Department of the Treasury to freeze assets and property of the Director General of SEBIN, Gustavo Enrique González López and the former Director General, Manuel Gregorio Bernal Martínez. International actions =United States= A SEBIN agent seen on a motorcycle in Caracas. In 2012, Livia Acosta Noguera and at least 10 other SEBIN agents that were allegedly operating under the guise of diplomatic missions left the United States following a controversy involving Acosta. In a Univision documentary, while Acosta was a cultural attaché in Mexico, she allegedly met with Mexican students posing as hackers that were supposedly planning to launch cyberattacks on the White House, the FBI, The Pentagon and several nuclear plants. After an FBI investigation and reactions from members of the United States congress, the United States Department of State declared Acosta Persona non grata. Despite the withdrawal of SEBIN agents, the government of Nicolás Maduro allegedly \\"maintains a network of spies in the United States, formed by supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution who are paid handsomely\\", according to former SEBIN officials. The former officials also stated that the contributions of \\"spies\\" is maintained by members of the \\"Patriotas Cooperantes\\" and from open source contributions, such as from press reports or information posted on websites. The Venezuelan government has used such tactics to reportedly observe government opposition organizations in the United States and has allegedly spied on United States government officials such as Cuban-American senator and representative Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), respectively. On 15 February 2019, General Director Manuel Cristopher Figuera was sanctioned by the United States for suspected human rights violations and torture. Following the Venezuelan uprising on 30 April 2019, the U.S. removed sanctions against Manuel Cristopher Figuera, who broke ranks with Maduro. Operations The Tomb\\" is located, in Caracas.alt= SEBIN operates from two headquarters; El Helicoide the original headquarters of the agency, and \\"La Tumba\\", its second and more updated facility. This federal entity could be considered the only security agency in Venezuela that never participates in any direct involvement with the general public. SEBIN doesn't patrol the public roads, arrest civilians, or do regular law enforcement work like police departments and doesn't participate in any police raids, joint task forces, or operations not related to the ministry of interior and justice. It is an agency that combines their counterparts of the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, and US Marshal core work, such as counterterrorism, intelligence, counterintelligence, government investigations, and background investigations and provides protection/escort for high-ranking government officials, among other federally mandated duties. Officers of this agency are rarely seen in public wearing their full black uniforms; they can be seen providing protection within a few federal buildings throughout the country.

In classical mechanics, areal velocity (also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity) is the rate at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve. In the adjoining figure, suppose that a particle moves along the blue curve. At a certain time t, the particle is located at point B, and a short while later, at time t + Δt, the particle has moved to point C. The area swept out by the particle is the green area in the figure, bounded by the line segments AB and AC and the curve along which the particle moves. The areal velocity equals this area divided by the time interval Δt in the limit that Δt becomes vanishingly small. It is an example of a pseudovector (also called axial vector), pointing normal to the plane containing the position and velocity vectors of the particle. Illustration of Kepler's second law. The planet moves faster near the Sun, so the same area is swept out in a given time as at larger distances, where the planet moves more slowly. The concept of areal velocity is closely linked historically with the concept of angular momentum. Kepler's second law states that the areal velocity of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant. Isaac Newton was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler's second law. With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. By the middle of the 18th century, the principle of angular momentum was discovered gradually by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler and Patrick d'Arcy; d'Arcy's version of the principle was phrased in terms of swept area. For this reason, the principle of angular momentum was often referred to in the older literature in mechanics as \\"the principle of equal areas.\\" Since the concept of angular momentum includes more than just geometry, the designation \\"principle of equal areas\\" has been dropped in modern works.  Connection with angular momentum  In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δt by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle ABC. As Δt approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a limit. Let the point D be the fourth corner of parallelogram ABDC shown in the figure, so that the vectors AB and AC add up by the parallelogram rule to vector AD. Then the area of triangle ABC is half the area of parallelogram ABDC, and the area of ABDC is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC. This area can also be viewed as a vector with this magnitude, pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram; this vector is the cross product itself: : \\\\text{vector area of parallelogram }ABCD = \\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\vec{r}(t + \\\\Delta t). Hence : \\\\text{vector area of triangle }ABC = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\vec{r}(t + \\\\Delta t)}{2}. The areal velocity is this vector area divided by Δt in the limit that Δt becomes vanishingly small: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{areal velocity} &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\vec{r}(t + \\\\Delta t)}{2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\bigl( \\\\vec{r}(t) + \\\\vec{r}\\\\,'(t) \\\\Delta t \\\\bigr)}{2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\vec{r}\\\\,'(t)}{2} \\\\left( {\\\\Delta t \\\\over \\\\Delta t} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}(t) \\\\times \\\\vec{r}\\\\,'(t)}{2}. \\\\end{align} But, \\\\vec{r}\\\\,'(t) is the velocity vector \\\\vec{v}(t) of the moving particle, so that : \\\\frac{d \\\\vec{A}}{d t} = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\vec{v}}{2}. On the other hand, the angular momentum of the particle is : \\\\vec{L} = \\\\vec{r} \\\\times m \\\\vec{v}, and hence the angular momentum equals 2m times the areal velocity. Conservation of areal velocity is a general property of central force motion, and, within the context of classical mechanics, is equivalent to the conservation of angular momentum.

Description The AGS-17 is a heavy infantry support weapon designed to operate from a tripod or mounted on an installation or vehicle. The AGS-17 fires 30 mm grenades in either direct or indirect fire to provide suppressive and lethal fire support against soft skinned or fortified targets. The weapon uses a blowback mechanism to sustain operation. Rounds are fired through a removable (to reduce barrel stress) rifled barrel. The standard metal ammunition drum contains 29 linked rounds. The tripod is equipped with fine levelling gear for indirect fire trajectories. Development Development of the AGS-17 (Avtomaticheskiy Granatomyot Stankovyi—Automatic Grenade launcher, Mounted) started in the USSR in 1965 by the OKB-16 design bureau (now known as the KBP Instrument Design Bureau, located in the city of Tula). Most probably its development was inspired by the Sino-Soviet border conflict of the late 1960s, as well as initial experience with several US automatic grenade launchers, learned from Vietnamese troops who were often on the receiving end of these weapons. It was thought that an automatic grenade launcher would be one of the most effective infantry support weapons against typical Chinese \\"human wave\\" attacks. This lightweight weapon was to provide infantry with close to medium range fire support against enemy personnel and unarmored targets, like trucks, half-tracks, jeeps and sandbag-protected machine-gun nests. The first prototypes of the new weapon entered trials in 1969, with mass production commencing in 1971. Never used against the Chinese, the AGS-17 was widely operated and well liked by Soviet troops in Afghanistan as a ground support weapon or as a vehicle weapon on improvised mounts installed on armored personnel carriers and trucks. At the same time, a special airborne version of the AGS-17 was developed for installation on Mi-24 Hind gunship helicopters. It is still in use with the Russian army as a direct fire support weapon for infantry troops; it is also installed in several vehicle mounts and turrets along with machine guns, guided rocket launchers and sighting equipment. A special airborne version, the AG-17A, was installed on the door mounts of several Mil Mi-8 Hip combat transport helicopters and on gun pods used in late model Mi-24 Hind gunships; this weapon had a thick aluminium jacket on the barrel and used a special mount and an electric remotely controlled trigger. It is being replaced by the AGS-30 launcher, (using the same ammunition, this weapon weighs only 16 kg unloaded on the tripod and has an upgraded blowback action). Variants *AGS-17A-remotely controlled aircraft mounted version with electric trigger mechanism. *AGS-17D-remotely controlled vehicle mounted version with electric trigger mechanism. RGSh-30 Ukrainian company Precision Systems developed a miniaturized handheld version of AGS-17 called RGSh-30 \\"in order to create a grenade launcher that could respond to the needs of Ukrainian units and special forces operating in the Donbass\\". RGSh-30 is designed to disable armored vehicles. that can be carried like an assault rifle. RGSh-30 uses magazines with five 30mm VOG-17 grenades. Precision Systems plans to develop versions using 20mm, 25mm, and 40mm grenades. Ammunition The AGS-17 fires 30×29 mm belted cartridges with a steel cartridge case. Two types of ammunition are commonly fired from the AGS-17. The VOG-17M is the version of the original 30 mm grenade ammunition, which is currently available and has a basic high explosive fragmentation warhead. The VOG-30 is similar, but contains a better explosive filling and an enhanced fragmentation design that greatly increases the effective blast radius. New improved VOG-30D grenade was taken into service in 2013 for use with AGS-17 and AGS-30 grenade launchers.https://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=auto&tl;=en&js;=y&prev;=_t&hl;=pl&ie;=UTF-8&u;=https%3A%2F%2Fria.ru%2Farms%2F20161110%2F1481078425.html&edit- text;=&act;=url The Bulgarian weapons manufacturer Arcus produces AR-ROG hand grenades based on VOG-17 cartridges and UZRGM (Russian: УЗРГМ), which is also a Soviet design of fuse. * VOG-17M (HE) * IO-30 (HE) * IO-30TP (Practice) * VOG-30 (HE) * VOG-30D (HE) * VUS-30 (Smoke) Users * Jones, Richard D.

Ramesside Period Kenneth Kitchen is regarded as one of the foremost scholars on the Ramesside Period of the New Kingdom; he published a well-respected book on Ramesses II in 1982 titled Pharaoh Triumphant: The Life and Times of Ramesses II, King of Egypt. Kitchen is a scholar who advocates a high view of the Old Testament and its inherent historicity. His 2003 book On the Reliability of the Old Testament documents several clear or indirect allusions to King David's status as the founder of Ancient Israel, based on passages in the Tel Dan ('House of David') and Mesha stelas as well as in Shoshenq I's Karnak list.pp. 90-94, 452, 453 Kitchen has strongly criticized the new chronology views of David Rohl, who posits that the Biblical Shishak who invaded the Kingdom of Judah in 925 BC was actually Ramesses II rather than Shoshenq I and argues that the 21st and 22nd Dynasties of Egypt were contemporary with one another due to the absence of Dynasty 21 Apis Bull stele in the Serapeum. Kitchen observes that the word Shishak is closer philologically to Shoshenq I and that this Pharaoh records in his monuments at Thebes that he campaigned actively against Ancient Israel and Judah.Kitchen (2003), pp. 10, 32, 33 Kitchen also notes that there are various contemporary non-Serapeum sources such as the Karnak Priestly Annals, the Nile Quay Texts, and various stelas which mention these Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 kings. Biblical scholarship Kitchen is an evangelical Christian, and has published frequently defending the historicity of the Old Testament. He is an outspoken critic of the documentary hypothesis, publishing various articles and books upholding his viewpoint, arguing that the Bible is historically reliable.The Factual Reliability of the Old Testament, by Kenneth A.

Lee during the American Civil War and the 14th Governor of Florida. Early life He was a descendant of Arthur Perry, one of the earliest settlers of New England. His parents were farmers, Asa and Philura Perry, and he was the fourth of five children. Born in Richmond, Massachusetts, Perry moved to Greenville, Alabama, in 1853, after briefly attending Yale University. In Alabama, he taught and studied law with Hilary Herbert, who later served as a Colonel in the Confederate States Army, a Congressman from Alabama, and Secretary of the Navy under President Grover Cleveland. Perry soon moved to Pensacola, Florida, and passed the bar exam. He served as a judge for Escambia County, Florida, from 1857 through 1861. He married Wathen Virginia Taylor of Greenville, Alabama, on February 1, 1859, the daughter of Hubbard Bonner Taylor and Marjorie Catherine Herbert Taylor, and a granddaughter of Dr. Hilary Herbert, one of the earliest settlers of Butler County, Alabama. Mrs. Perry was also a cousin of the Hilary A. Herbert, with whom he studied law in Alabama. American Civil War During the Civil War, Perry fought with distinction for the Confederacy, rising from the rank of private to brigadier general. In May 1861, he enlisted in the \\"Pensacola Rifle Rangers\\",Roberston, F. L., 1903. Soldiers of Florida in the Seminole Indian- Civil and Spanish–American Wars.

A year later, he was elected colonel of the regiment. General E.A. Perryhttp://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/128297 In June 1862, he was wounded during the fight at Glendale during the Peninsula Campaign and furloughed. On August 28, 1862, Perry was appointed as a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of the Confederacy and returned to active duty the following year. He led an all-Florida brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Chancellorsville, but was stricken with typhoid fever and missed the Gettysburg Campaign, where Col. David Lang commanded Perry's Brigade. Perry returned to the Army of Northern Virginia to command his brigade for the Bristoe Campaign in the fall of 1863. However, he was severely wounded in the fighting at the Wilderness on May 6, 1864. He briefly returned to the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, but had not recovered sufficiently for active duty. Hence, he was sent to Alabama for the duration of the war, serving on reserve duty in the Confederate Invalid Corps. Aftermath; Governor He returned to Florida and became a prominent lawyer and Democratic state politician. Elected governor in 1884, he assumed office on January 7, 1885. During his administration, Florida adopted a new constitution and established the state board of education. He was an outspoken opponent of the carpetbaggers. Perry was active in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. His antebellum home became the Scottish Rite Temple in downtown Pensacola.Scottish Rite Masonic Center at Pensapedia. The Confederate Monument on Palafox Street bears a plaque honoring his wife, Wathen Virginia Taylor Perry, who raised the funds for its erection. After leaving office on January 8, 1889, he returned home to Pensacola. In later years, the property was sold for $2.53 million to the adjacent First United Methodist Church, and fund raising for renovations are in place. He died suddenly of a stroke while visiting Kerrville, Texas, in 1889, aged 58. He and his wife are buried in St. John's Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

She remained on the Jamaica station for the next year. In March 1780, Lion fought an action in company with two other ships against a larger French force off Monte Christi on San Domingo. A second action took place in June 1780 near Bermuda when Cornwallis in Lion, with three other ships of the line and a fifty-gun ship, met a larger French squadron carrying the troops of Rochambeau to North America. The French were too strong for Cornwallis's squadron, but were content to continue with their mission instead of attacking the smaller British force..

The study of victimology seeks to mitigate the prejudice against victims, and the perception that victims are in any way responsible for the actions of offenders. There is historical and current prejudice against the victims of domestic violence and sex crimes, such as the greater tendency to blame victims of rape than victims of robbery if victims and perpetrators knew each other prior to the commission of the crime. Coining of the phrase Psychologist William Ryan coined the phrase \\"blaming the victim\\" in his 1971 book of that title. In the book, Ryan described victim blaming as an ideology used to justify racism and social injustice against black people in the United States. Ryan wrote the book to refute Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 work The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (usually simply referred to as the Moynihan Report). Moynihan had concluded that three centuries of oppression of black people, and in particular with what he calls the uniquely cruel structure of American slavery as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and single mother households in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of employment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population. The black family structure is also being affected by media through the children. The Black family is usually portrayed as gang affiliated, a single-parent or very violent. Aggression and violent behavior in children has been linked to television programming. Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black nuclear family. Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the proximate cause of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Ryan's critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from social structural factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.Illinois state U. archives . History Although Ryan popularized the phrase, other scholars had identified the phenomenon of victim blaming. In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called \\"blaming the victim,\\" as \\"one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character\\".Adorno, TW (1947) Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler in Kenyon Review Vol.ix (1), p. 158 James Martin Harding (1997) Adorno and \\"A writing of the ruins\\": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture, p.143 quotation: \\"The mechanisms of this ideological affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the Second World War—at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, \\"bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities\\" (Adorno \\"Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler\\" 158).\\" Shortly thereafter Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley formulated their influential and highly debated F-scale (F for fascist), published in The Authoritarian Personality (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the \\"contempt for everything discriminated against or weak.\\"Adorno and the political By Espen Hammer p.63 A typical expression of victim blaming is the \\"asking for it\\" idiom, e.g. \\"she was asking for it\\" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault. Secondary victimization of sexual and other assault victims Hundreds gathered at the Alberta Legislature grounds in Edmonton to protest against victim blaming Secondary victimization is the re- traumatization of the sexual assault, abuse, surgical battery, medical malpractice, or rape victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming, disbelieving the victim's story, minimizing the severity of the attack, and inappropriate post-assault treatment by medical personnel or other organizations. Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of drug- facilitated, acquaintance, military sexual trauma and statutory rape. Sexual assault victims experience stigmatization based on rape myths. A female rape victim is especially stigmatized in patrilineal cultures with strong customs and taboos regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a society may view a female rape victim (especially one who was previously a virgin) as \\"damaged\\". Victims in these cultures may suffer isolation, physical and psychological abuse, slut-shaming, public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed. However, even in many developed countries, including some sectors of United States society, misogyny remains culturally ingrained. One example of a sexist allegation against female victims of sexual assault is that wearing provocative clothing stimulates sexual aggression in men who believe that women wearing body-revealing clothes are actively trying to seduce a sexual partner. Such accusations against victims stem from the assumption that sexually revealing clothing conveys consent for sexual actions, irrespective of willful verbal consent. Research has yet to prove that attire is a significant causal factor in determining who is assaulted. Victim blaming is also exemplified when a victim of sexual assault is found at fault for performing actions which reduce their ability to resist or refuse consent, such as consuming alcohol. Victim advocacy groups and medical professionals are educating young adults on the definition of consent, and the importance of refraining from victim blaming. Most institutions have adopted the concept of affirmative consent and that refraining from sexual activity while under the influence is the safest choice. In efforts to discredit alleged sexual assault victims in court, a defense attorney may delve into an accuser's personal history, a common practice that also has the purposeful effect of making the victim so uncomfortable they choose not to proceed. This attack on character, especially one pointing out promiscuity, makes the argument that women who lead \\"high risk\\" lifestyles (promiscuity, drug use) are not real victims of rape. Findings on Rape Myth Acceptance have supported feminist claims that sexism is at the root of female rape victim blaming. A 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence of male victims of sexual assault concludes that male rape victim blaming is usually done so because of social constructs of masculinity. Some effects of these kind of rape cases include a loss of masculinity, confusion about their sexual orientation, and a sense of failure in behaving as men should. Victims of an unwanted sexual encounter usually develop psychological problems such as depression or sexual violence specific PTSD known as rape trauma syndrome. =Ideal victim= An ideal victim is one who is afforded the status of victimhood due to unavoidable circumstances that put the individual at a disadvantage. One can apply this theory to any crime including and especially sexual assault. Nils Christie, a Norwegian criminology professor, has been theorizing about the concept of the ideal victim since the 1980s. In his research he gives two examples, one of an old woman who is attacked on her way home from visiting her family and the other of a man who is attacked at a bar by someone he knew. He describes the old woman as an ideal victim because she could not avoid being in the location that she was, she did not know her attacker, and she could not fight off her attacker. The man, however, could have avoided being at a bar, knew his attacker, and should have been able to fight off his attacker, being younger and a man. When applying the ideal victim theory to sexual assault victims, often judicial proceedings define an ideal victim as one who resists their attacker and exercises caution in risky situations, despite law reforms to extinguish these fallacious requirements. When victims are not ideal they are at risk for being blamed for their attack because they are not considered real victims of rape. Because they do not fit the criteria being laid out in the rape law, they cannot be considered real victims and thereby their attacker will not be prosecuted. A victim who is not considered an ideal, or real victim, is one who leads a \\"high risk\\" lifestyle, partaking in drugs or alcohol, or is perceived as promiscuous. A victim who intimately knows their attacker is also not considered an ideal victim. An example of a sexual assault victim who is not ideal is a prostitute because they lead a high risk lifestyle. The perception is that these behaviors discount the credibility of a sexual assault victim's claim or that the behaviors and associations create the mistaken assumption of consent. Some of or all of the blame of the assault is then placed on these victims, and so they are not worthy of having their case presented in court. These perceptions persist in court rulings despite a shift in laws favoring affirmative consent- meaning that the participants in a sexual activity give a verbal affirmation rather than one participant who neither answers negatively nor positively. In other words, affirmative consent is yes means yes, no means no and no verbal answer also means no. A study focusing on the help-seeking process of underage victims of sexual violence established that the ideal victim stereotype played a pivotal part in others’ attitudes towards the victim. Victims conforming with the stereotype were approached with compassion, support, and adequate guidance, in contrast to the victims who diverged from the stereotype and were blamed, shamed, and seldom guided to further action. The only victims who received the help they needed (e.g., were able to tell someone or report the crime) were the ones conforming with the ideal victim stereotype; however, the majority of victims do not fit the stereotype. In addition to an ideal victim, there must be an ideal perpetrator for a crime to be considered ideal. The ideal attacker does not know their victim and is a completely non-sympathetic figure- one who is considered sub-human, an individual lacking morals. An attacker that knows their victim is not considered an ideal attacker, nor is someone who seems morally ordinary. Cases of intimate partner violence are not considered ideal because the victim knows their attacker. Husbands and wives are not ideal victims or perpetrators because they are intimately familiar with each other.  Global situation  Many different cultures across the globe have formulated different degrees of victim blaming for different scenarios such as rape, hate crimes, and domestic abuse. Victim blaming is common around the world, especially in cultures where it is socially acceptable and advised to treat certain groups of people as lesser. For example, in Somalia victims of sexual abuse consistently endure social ostracization and harassment. One specific example is the kidnapping and rape of 14-year old Fatima: when the police arrived, both Fatima and her rapist were arrested. While they did not detain the offender for long, the officers held Fatima captive for a month and a prison guard continually raped her during that time. In February 2016, the organisations International Alert and UNICEF published a study revealing that girls and women released from captivity by Nigeria's insurgency group Boko Haram often face rejection by their communities and families. Their children born of sexual violence faced even more discrimination. Acid attacks on South Asian women, when people throw acid on women in an attempt to punish them for their perceived wrongdoings, are another example of victim-blaming. For instance, in New Delhi in 2005, a group of men threw acid on a 16-year-old girl because they believed she provoked the advances of a man. In Chinese culture, victim blaming is often associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the woman’s fault and her virtue is inevitably called into question. In Western culture victim blaming has been largely recognized as a problematic way to view a situation, however this does not exempt Westerners from being guilty of the action. A recent example of Western victim blaming would be a civil trial held in 2013 where the Los Angeles School District blamed a 14-year-old girl for the sexual abuse she endured from her middle school teacher. The District's lawyer argued that the minor was responsible for the prevention of the abuse, putting the entire fault on the victim and exempting the perpetrator of any responsibility. Despite his efforts to convince the court that the victim must be blamed, the ruling stated that no minor student that has been sexually assaulted by his or her teacher is responsible for the prevention of that sexual assault. Opposing views Roy Baumeister, a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of \\"the myth of pure evil,\\" the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths. In context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the \\"victim\\" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their \\"moral complexity\\". This usually stems from an \\"excessive sensitivity\\" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them. Horseshoe theory and nonpolarized views Some scholars make the argument that some of the attitudes that are described as victim blaming and the victimologies that are said to counteract them are both extreme and similar to each other, an example of the horseshoe theory. For instance, they argue that the claim that \\"women wearing provocative clothing cause rape\\" is as demeaning to men as it is to women as depicting men as incapable of controlling their sexual desire is misandrist and denies men full agency, while also arguing that the generalization that women do not lie about rape (or any generalization about women not doing some things because of their gender) is misogynist by its implicit assumption that women act by simple default action modes which is incompatible with full agency. These scholars argue that it is important to impartially assess the evidence in each criminal trial individually and that any generalization based on statistics would change the situation from one where the control of evidence makes false reporting difficult to one where lack of individual control of the alleged crime makes it easier to file false reports and that statistics collected in the former situation would not be possible to apply to the latter situation. While the scholars make a distinction between actual victim blaming and rule by law that they consider to be falsely lumped with victim blaming in radical feminist rhetorics, they also advocate more protection from ad hominem questions to alleged victims about past life history and that the questions should focus on what is relevant for the specific alleged crime. They also cite examples that they consider to be cases of the horseshoe theory applied to the question of victim blaming. This includes cases in which psychologists who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in trials in which breast size have been used as a measure of female age when classifying pornographic cartoons as child pornography and been praised by feminists for it, and later the same psychologists have used the same psychological arguments when testifying on behalf of the defense in statutory rape cases and getting the defendant acquitted by claiming that the victim's breasts looked like those of an adult woman (considered by these scholars to be victim blaming based on appearance) and been praised by men's rights groups for it. It also includes the possibility that biopsychiatric models that consider sexual criminality hereditary and that are advocated by some feminists may blame victims of incest abuse for being genetically related to their abusers and thereby dissuading them from reporting abuse. Other analysts of victim blaming discourse who neither support most of the phenomena that are described as victim blaming nor most of the measures that are marketed as countermeasures against such point at the existence of other ways of discovering and punishing crimes with victims besides the victim reporting the crime. Not only are there police patrols and possible eyewitnesses, but these analysts also argue that neighbors can overhear and report crimes that take place within the house such as domestic violence. For that reason along with the possibility of many witnesses turning up over time if the crime is ongoing long term as domestic abuse is generally said to be which would make some of the witnesses likely to be considered believable, analysts of this camp of thought argue that the main problem that prevent crimes from being successfully prosecuted is offender profiling that disbelieve the capacity and/or probability of many criminals to commit the crime, rather than disbelief or blaming of victim reports. These analysts cite international comparisons that show that the percentage of male on female cases in the statistics of successfully prosecuted domestic violence is not higher in countries that apply gender feminist theories about patriarchal structures than in countries that apply supposedly antifeminist evolutionary psychology profiling of sex differences in aggressiveness, impulse control and empathy, arguing that the criminal justice system prioritizing cases in which they believe the suspect most likely to be guilty makes evolutionary psychology at least as responsible as gender feminism for leaving domestic violence cases with female offenders undiscovered no matter if the victim is male or female. The analysts argue that many problems that are often attributed to victim blaming are instead due to offender profiling, and suggest randomized investigations instead of psychological profiling of suspected offenders. Examples A myth holds that Jews went passively \\"like sheep to the slaughter\\" during the Holocaust, which is considered by many writers, including Emil Fackenheim, to be a form of victim blaming. Secondary antisemitism is a type of antisemitism caused by non-Jewish Europeans' attempts to shift blame for the Holocaust onto the Jews, often summed up by the claim that \\"The Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.\\" In recent years, the issue of victim blaming has gained notoriety and become widely recognized in the media, particularly in the context of feminism, as women have often been blamed for behaving in ways that encourage harassment. =United States= In a case that became infamous in 2011, an 11-year-old female rape victim who suffered repeated gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas, was accused by a defense attorney of being a seductress who lured men to their doom. \\"Like the spider and the fly. Wasn't she saying, 'Come into my parlor', said the spider to the fly?\\", he asked a witness. The New York Times ran an article uncritically reporting on the way many in the community blamed the victim, for which the newspaper later apologized. =Germany= In 2016, in the wake of New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, the mayor of Cologne Henriette Reker came under heavy criticism, as her response appeared to blame the victims. She called for women to follow a \\"code of conduct,\\" including staying at an \\"arm's length\\" from strangers. By the evening of 5 January, #einearmlänge (\\"an arm's length\\") became one of Germany's top-trending hashtags on Twitter. Reker called a crisis meeting with the police in response to the incidents. Reker called it \\"completely improper\\" to link the perpetrators to refugees. =Italy= Coverage of the 2016 Murder of Ashley Ann Olsen, an American murdered in Italy during a sexual encounter with a Senegalese immigrant, focused on the victim blaming in cross-cultural encounters. =India= In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when a woman was raped and killed in Delhi in December 2012, some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for various things, mostly based on conjecture. Many of the people involved later apologized. In August 2017, the hashtag #AintNoCinderella trended on social media India, in response to a high-profile instance of victim-blaming. After Varnika Kundu was stalked and harassed by two men on her way home late at night, Bharatiya Janata Party Vice President Ramveer Bhatti addressed the incident with a claim that Kundu was somehow at fault for being out late by herself. Social media users took to Twitter and Instagram to challenge the claim that women should not be out late at night, and if they are, they are somehow \\"asking for it\\". Hundreds of women shared photos of themselves staying out past midnight, dressing boldly, and behaving in (harmless) ways that tend to be condemned in old-fashioned, anti- feminist ideology.Pandey, Geeta. \\"#AintNoCinderella: Why Indian women are posting midnight photos.\\" BBC, Delhi. https://www.bbc.com/news/40872788 =Australia= Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears, was a 14-year-old girl from Fern Bay, Australia, who was murdered on 3 November 1989. While attending a 16-year-old boy's birthday party at Stockton Beach, Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull. Leigh's murder received considerable attention in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of victim blaming. Former Australian Senator Fraser Anning was sharply criticised for his comments about the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, in which 51 Muslim worshippers were killed. He claimed that immigration of \\"Muslim fanatics\\" led to the attacks, and that \\"while Muslims may have been victims today, usually they are the perpetrators\\". Anning also stated that the massacre \\"highlights...the growing fear within our community...of the increasing Muslim presence\\". The comments received international attention and were overwhelmingly criticised as being insensitive and racist, and sympathetic to the views of the perpetrator.

A RIA is a very sensitive in vitro assay technique used to measure concentrations of substances, usually measuring antigen concentrations (for example, hormone levels in blood) by use of antibodies. Although the RIA technique is extremely sensitive and extremely specific, requiring specialized equipment, it remains among the least expensive methods to perform such measurements. It requires special precautions and licensing, since radioactive substances are used. In contrast, an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules but in an immediate rather than stepwise way. A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is an example of radioimmunoassay. It is used to detect the causative allergen for an allergy. Method Classically, to perform a radioimmunoassay, a known quantity of an antigen is made radioactive, frequently by labeling it with gamma-radioactive isotopes of iodine, such as 125-I, attached to tyrosine. This radiolabeled antigen is then mixed with a known amount of antibody for that antigen, and as a result, the two specifically bind to one another. Then, a sample of serum from a patient containing an unknown quantity of that same antigen is added. This causes the unlabeled (or \\"cold\\") antigen from the serum to compete with the radiolabeled antigen (\\"hot\\") for antibody binding sites. As the concentration of \\"cold\\" antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the radiolabeled variant, and reducing the ratio of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen to free radiolabeled antigen. The bound antigens are then separated and the radioactivity of the free(unbound) antigen remaining in the supernatant is measured using a gamma counter. This method can be used for any biological molecule in principle and is not restricted to serum antigens, nor is it required to use the indirect method of measuring the free antigen instead of directly measuring the captured antigen. For example, if it is undesirable or not possible to radiolabel the antigen or target molecule of interest, a RIA can be done if two different antibodies that recognize the target are available and the target is large enough (e.g., a protein) to present multiple epitopes to the antibodies. One antibody would be radiolabeled as above while the other would remain unmodified. The RIA would begin with the \\"cold\\" unlabeled antibody being allowed to interact and bind to the target molecule in solution. Preferably, this unlabeled antibody is immobilized in some way, such as coupled to an agarose bead, coated to a surface, etc. Next, the \\"hot\\" radiolabeled antibody is allowed to interact with the first antibody-target molecule complex. After extensive washing, the direct amount of radioactive antibody bound is measured and the amount of target molecule quantified by comparing it to a reference amount assayed at the same time. This method is similar in principle to the non-radioactive sandwich ELISA method. History This method was developed by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx, New YorkBerson, Solomon A., et al. \\"Insulin-I 131 metabolism in human subjects: demonstration of insulin binding globulin in the circulation of insulin treated subjects.\\" The Journal of clinical investigation 35.2 (1956): 170-190.Berson, Solomon A., and Rosalyn S. Yalow. \\"Quantitative aspects of the reaction between insulin and insulin-binding antibody.\\" The Journal of clinical investigation 38.11 (1959): 1996-2016.. This revolutionary development earned Dr. Yalow the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1977, the second woman ever to win it. In her acceptance speech, Dr. Yalow said, \\"The world cannot afford the loss of the talents of half its people if we are to solve the many problems which beset us.\\" Yalow shared the Nobel Prize with Roger Guillemin, and Andrew Schally who earned the prize based on their research into \\"the peptide hormone production of the brain\\".

It was founded in 1826 as the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts, making it one of the oldest art colleges in the United States. MICA is a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD), a consortium of 36 leading US art schools, as well as the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). The college hosts pre-college, post-baccalaureate, continuing studies, Master of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Fine Arts programs, as well as young peoples' studio art classes. History \\"The Maryland Institute\\", above the old \\"Centre Market\\" on Market Place between East Baltimore Street and Water Street, east of South Frederick Street and west of the Jones Falls stream, home of M.I., 1851–1904 = Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts = The Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts was established by prominent citizens of Baltimore, such as Fielding Lucas Jr. (founder of Lucas Brothers - office supply company), John H. B. Latrobe (lawyer, artist, author, civic leader), Hezekiah Niles (founder of national newspaper Niles Weekly Register) and Thomas Kelso. Other leaders and officers in that first decade were William Stewart (president), George Warner, and Fielding Lucas Jr. (vice presidents), John Mowton (recording secretary), Dr. William Howard (corresponding secretary), as well as James H. Clarke and D.P. McCoy (managers), Solomon Etting (local merchant/political leader), Benjamin C. Howard, William Hubbard, William Meeter, William Roney, William F. Small, S.D. Walker, John D. Craig, Jacob Deems, William H. Freeman, Moses Hand, William Krebs, Robert Cary Long, Jr. (architect), Peter Leary, James Mosher, Henry Payson (founder of First Unitarian Church), P. K. Stapleton, James Sykes and P. B. Williams. The General Assembly of Maryland incorporated the Institute in 1826, and starting in November of that year (Tuesday, November 7, 1826), exhibitions of articles of American manufacture were held in the \\"Concert Hall\\" on South Charles Street. A course of lectures on subjects connected with the mechanic arts was inaugurated, and a library of works on mechanics and the sciences was begun. The school operated for a decade at \\"The Athenaeum\\" (the first of two structures to bear that name, a landmark for educational, social, cultural, civic and political affairs) at the southwest corner of East Lexington and St. Paul Streets facing the second Baltimore City/County Courthouse between North Calvert and St. Paul Streets. This first Athenaeum was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1835 along with all of its property and records. The fire was caused by a bank riot due to the financial panic following the collapse of several Baltimore banks. In November 1847, Benjamin S. Benson and sixty-nine others (including many of the original founders of the former Institute), issued a call for a meeting of those favorable to the formation of a mechanics' institute, which resulted in the reopening of the Institute on January 12, 1848. The first annual exhibition was held at \\"Washington Hall\\" in October 1848, followed by two more. The 1948 officers were John A. Rodgers – president, Adam Denmead – first vice president, James Milholland – second vice president, John B. Easter – recording secretary, and Samuel Boyd – treasurer. The Institute was reincorporated by the state legislature at their December session in 1849 and was endowed by an annual appropriation from the State of Maryland of five hundred dollars. In 1849, the Board of Managers extended the usefulness and broadened the appeal of its programs to ordinary citizens by opening a School of Design and an additional Night School of Design was extended two years later in the new hall and building, under William Minifie (from the Faculty of the old Central High School of Baltimore) as principal of the reorganized Institute. Classes resumed in rented space over the downtown Baltimore branch of the U.S. Post Office Department in the \\"Merchants Exchange\\". The City Council in 1850 passed an ordinance granting the Institute permission to erect a new building over a reconstructed \\"Centre Market\\", laying the cornerstone on March 13, 1851, with John H. B. Latrobe, and son of national architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, (1764–1820). In 1851, the Institute moved to its own building, built above the old Centre Market on Market Place (formerly Harrison Street) between East Baltimore Street (to the north) and Water Street (to the south) alongside the western shore of the Jones Falls. Centre Market continued to be known in the city as \\"Marsh Market\\" after the former Harrison's Marsh from colonial times. The building covered an entire block and had two stories built on a series of brick arches above the market, with two clock towers at each end. The second floor with the Institute, housed classrooms, offices, shops and studios and one of the largest assembly halls/auditorium in the state. During this period the Institute added a School of Chemistry, thanks in part to a bequest from philanthropist George Peabody, (1795–1869), (for which the Peabody Institute and George Peabody Library is named) and B.& O. Railroad President Thomas Swann, along with a School of Music. Night classes for Design are added for men who work during the day, but would like training in Architecture and Engineering at night. In 1854, a Day School of Design opened for women—one of the first US arts programs for women. In 1860, the Day School for men opened, and in 1870, the Day school became co-ed. The Maryland Institute, after the 1904 Fire For 79 years the Institute remained in the location above the Centre Market, and its \\"Great Hall\\", large enough to accommodate 6,000, attracted many famous speakers and lecturers. It hosted events and shows related to the Arts, and as one of Baltimore's largest halls, it hosted important events to the city and the region. In 1852, it hosted both of the National political conventions to nominate presidential candidates Winfield Scott and his opponent Franklin Pierce (who was later elected 14th President of the United States). During the American Civil War, the Institute served briefly as an armory for the Union and a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of Antietam. On April 18, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln gave his famous speech known as the \\"Baltimore Address\\" (or \\"Liberty Speech\\") during a \\"Sanitary Fair\\" held in the Great Hall to benefit Union soldiers and families. On February 7–8, 1904, the Centre Market and the Maryland Institute burned down along with 1,500 other buildings in downtown Baltimore during the Great Baltimore Fire. Temporarily, classes moved to spaces above other covered municipal markets in the city, while construction was ongoing in two locations. Michael Jenkins donated the future site of the \\"Main Building\\" on Mount Royal Avenue near the new Bolton Hill neighborhood in the northwest, which opened in 1908. It was to house the School of Art and Design, and the City of Baltimore offered the old site and funding to rebuild the Centre Market as a location for the Drafting school and \\"mechanical arts\\". Upon opening, the Main building had spaces for pottery, metal working, wood carving, free-hand drafting and textile design, as well as a library, galleries and exhibition rooms. The galleries and exhibition rooms were important, because at the time of construction, Baltimore had no public art museum (institutions such as the Walters Art Gallery were not founded and opened for regular public viewing until 1909 and acquired by the city in 1934, and the Baltimore Museum of Art, in 1914). In 1923, the Institute's galleries hosted the first known public showing of Henri Matisse's work in the United States, brought from Europe by sisters Claribel and Etta Cone. In 1928, the new Centre Market building, now known as \\"The Market Place\\" building, offered a course in Aeronautics theory and drafting following the great excitement and increase in interest in the industry following Charles Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic Ocean to Paris. = Maryland Institute, College of Art = The Institute legally changed its name to the \\"Maryland Institute, College of Art\\" in 1959, and the \\"Market Place Building\\" was razed to make room for the extension south of the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83). The consolidation of MICA to the Mount Royal campus was furthered by the purchase of the Mount Royal Station, a former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) train station, in 1964. In 1968, MICA was forced to close due to the Baltimore riot of 1968, which broke out two days after the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee. From 1972–1975, MICA was graced with the presence of artists and critics of the period, including composer John Cage, poet Allen Ginsberg, photographer Walker Evans, master printer Kenneth E. Tyler, painter Elaine de Kooning and art critic Clement Greenberg. In the following years, MICA expanded along Mount Royal Avenue, adding the \\"Fox Building\\" in 1978, the \\"College Center\\" (now the \\"Art Tech Center\\") in 1986, a renovation of the \\"Main Building\\" in 1990, \\"The Commons\\" (added 1992), \\"Bunting Center\\" (1998), the \\"Meyerhoff House\\" (2002), the \\"Brown Center\\" (2003), the \\"Studio Center\\" (2007) and \\"The Gateway\\" (2008). During that time, the College focused on increased interaction with the international art world—offering study abroad programs and residences in numerous countries around the world. The school's logo was redesigned in 2007 by Abbott Miller of Pentagram and is said to be a \\"visual reference to the architecture\\" found at the 1907 Main Building and 2003 Brown Center. Curriculum and degrees MICA offers various undergraduate degree, graduate degrees and certificates including B.F.A., M.A., M.A.T., M.B.A., M.F.A., M.P.S. Some of the degree programs are partially online or fully online. The school has accreditation from Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1967, and National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) since 1948. In the Fall 2017 term, there were 433 part-time faculty and 178 full-time faculty, with an 8 to 1 student-to-faculty ratio. Students and alumni Student art exhibit, May 2012. In Fall 2017, the total student enrollment was 2,128, with 1,824 undergraduate students and 379 graduate students hailing from across the US and foreign countries. The student body in Fall 2017 was 75% female and 25% male. MICA has an acceptance rate of 62% in 2017. 86% of B.F.A. graduates who take jobs immediately after graduation are working in art related fields; 23% of MICA's B.F.A. graduates pursue graduate study immediately after graduation. From 2009-2017, 14 MICA graduates received Fulbright awards for study abroad and five students earned the Jacob Javits Fellowship for graduate study. Since 2003, two alumni have received the national Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Graduate Scholarship and three Jack Kent Cooke Foundation scholars chose to study at MICA. Additionally, four alumni were awarded Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grants. Facilities MICA's campus is a mixture of buildings from different periods of Baltimore's development. Main hall =Main building= Main Building The Main Building houses painting and drawing studios, undergraduate photography department, foundation department, two departmental galleries, undergraduate admissions and the President's Office. Construction began on a new campus in Bolton Hill when its Centre Market building was destroyed. Construction was completed in 1908. The State of Maryland, the Carnegie Foundation, and local benefactors contributed funds to build it. Michael Jenkins donated the land, stipulating that the new building not clash with the nearby Gothic Revival Corpus Christi Church. The Main Building was the first to be designed by New York-based architects Pell & Corbett, who were awarded the contract when they won a $500 design contest sponsored by the New York Association of Independent Architects. Otto Fuchs designed the interior studio plans. The architecture was intended to evoke a feeling of the Grand Canal of Venice, c. 1400. The exterior marble is carved from \\"Beaver Dam\\" marble, excavated from the Baltimore County quarry near Cockeysville, Maryland. It is the same marble used to build the Washington Monument in Baltimore designed by Robert Mills, and part of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Architectural features include the main entrance, offering a large marble staircase, stained-glass skylight and the names of Renaissance masters surrounding the entrance to the second floor. The exterior of the northeast façade features four stone memorial medallions: one for the city, one for the state and two others honoring Institute benefactors Andrew Carnegie and Michael Jenkins. Throughout the Main Building plaster replicas of Greek and Roman statues offer students study targets for their Foundation year. In 1908, the New York Association of Independent Architects awarded the building a gold key, the highest award in architecture at the time. From 1990-1992, the building underwent a $5.1 million renovation under the direction of the Grieves, Worrell, Wright & O'Hatnick, Inc (GWWO) architectural firm. The renovation upgraded the building's facilities and created additional academic and office space while retaining much of the original design and décor. =Mount Royal Station= The Mount Royal Station houses the undergraduate departments of fiber and interdisciplinary sculpture, 3D classrooms, and the Rinehart School of Sculpture, as well as senior studios. The railroad tracks underneath the train shed remain active as CSX Transportation's freight mainline to New York City. Built in 1896, the Mount Royal Station (now known as The Station Building) was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's showcase passenger station until it ceased operations in 1961. MICA purchased the building in 1964 and renovated it in 1966 under the direction of architect Richard Donkervoet, retaining as much of the building's exterior and interior as possible, including vaulted ceilings, columns and mosaic floor. Margaret Mead, in a lecture given at the Station, commented that the renovation \\"is perhaps the most magnificent example in the Western World of something being made into something else\\". On December 8, 1976, the Station was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks, granting it full protection as an historic site. The Mount Royal Station's gable-roofed train shed, one of the country's last remaining such structures, was renovated in 1985. Between 2005–2007, MICA accomplished a two-phased, $6.3 million renovation by the architectural firm Grieves, Worrall, Wright & O'Hatnick, Inc. (GWWO). =Dolphin Building= The Dolphin Building at 100 Dolphin Street formerly housed MICA's Printmaking department and Book Arts and Printmaking concentrations, as well as the independent Dolphin Press. It had of working space divided into three floors. In 2016, MICA demolished the Dolphin Building in preparation of a five story/25,000 square feet structure, designed by Baltimore architectural firm GWWO. The building reopened in September 2017, and is now home to the Interactive Arts, Game Design, Product Design, and Architectural Design departments. =Bunting Center= Bunting Center houses Liberal Arts departments (art history and language, literature, and culture), the campus Writing Center, academic advising and the registrar. Bunting Center also houses a restaurant, Java Corner. The first floor and basement level house the Decker Library, which includes a collection of over 600 art books in its Special Collections area. Students are allowed to view any Special Collections item by requesting it from library staff. The library also includes an oversized Folio section and a wide collection of video and film materials, including DVD and Blu-ray. It hosts display cases for monthly exhibits, a private Screening Room for viewing films and holding meetings, and a classroom for instruction. Bunting Center contains the Pinkard Gallery and Student Space Gallery. The acquisition and renovation of Bunting Center increased MICA's academic space by 20% when it opened in 1998. It was named for trustee George Bunting, who was also instrumental in the development of the Fox Building, among other projects. The Bunting Center received the Grand Design Award and Honor Award from AIA Baltimore in 1998. In 2007, architect Steve Ziger headed the building's $5.5 million renovation, seeking to create \\"a real sense of neighborhood\\" for the college. =Firehouse= The Firehouse hosts the College's operations and facilities management department. The building has of space. MICA purchased a historic Firehouse along North Avenue in 2001 and renovated the building in 2003. As part of the redevelopment agreement, MICA maintained the station's front façade in accordance with Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation standards. The renovation architect was Cho Benn Holback + Associates, Inc. Kajima Construction Services was the contractor. The Firehouse won an award from the Baltimore Heritage Foundation for preservation in 2004. =Fox Building= The Fox Building The building houses Decker Gallery, Café Doris, Meyerhoff Gallery, the Center for Art Education, the Division of Continuing Studies, as well as Ceramics, Illustration, Environmental Design, GFA, Drawing and Painting departments, the woodshop, the nature library, and Graphic Design MA (formerly Graphic Design Post-Baccalaureate). The Fox Building offers more than of usable space. Built in 1915 as the Cannon Shoe Factory, the Fox Building was purchased in 1976. After two years of planning by architects Ayers/Saint/Gross, work began in 1979 and the newly renovated building opened in 1980. This renovation retained most of the warehouse character of the building, including exposed ductwork and framing and the original exterior—The renovations cost $2.5 million, and the building was named for architect Charles J. Fox, a 1965 graduate of MICA whose family contributed over $1.5 million of the renovation cost. After the conversion, the Mount Royal Improvement Association granted MICA an Award of Merit for its contribution to the community. In 2005, a second renovation added another gallery and cafe. =Bank Building (Studio Center)= The building houses the post-baccalaureate certificate program, Hoffberger School of Painting, The Mount Royal School of Art, the Graduate Photographic and Electronic Media program, and Senior student studios. Although the official name is The Studio Center, many students know it as The Bank Building. MICA purchased the former Jos. A. Bank sewing plant on North Avenue in August 2000. The all-brick building dates to the early 20th century and was home to Morgan Millwork for most of the century. The Brown Center Brown Center interior =Brown Center= The Brown Center houses MICA's digital art and design programs, as well as the 525-seat Falvey Hall, which, in addition to hosting school-related functions, has also played host to events like the Maryland Film Festival and National Portfolio Day. It houses the Video, Animation, and BFA and MFA Graphic Design departments. It also has an art gallery, a secondary hall for lectures (\\"Brown 320\\"), and a \\"Black-Box\\" area for Interactive Media installations. The first newly constructed academic building for the College in nearly a hundred years, Brown Center was dedicated on October 17, 2003 and became fully operational in January 2004. It was bolstered by a $6 million gift from Eddie and Sylvia Brown, the largest gift ever received by the Institute. The building was designed by architect Charles Brickbauer and Ziger/Snead. The , five-story contemporary structure garnered acclaim as an architectural landmark. Awards have included the AIABaltimore 2004 Grand Design Award, AIA Maryland 2004 Honor Award of Excellence, regional award of merit in 2004 in the International Illumination Design Award competition, and several awards for excellence in construction. In addition, MICA President Fred Lazarus traveled to Italy in June 2006 to receive the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for Brown Center. Brown Center was the only American project among the finalists. =Additional facilities= Additional buildings making up MICA's campus include the Maryland Institute College of Art shop (known simply as \\"The MICA Store\\") at 1501 W. Mount Royal Ave. selling art supplies and books, and official MICA merchandise. Student housing The Meyerhoff and The Gateway buildings increased MICA student housing 90% between 2002 and 2009, allowing more students to stay on campus. = Founder’s Green = Founder's Green is a three-building, four-story student apartment complex. Among the first student residences to be constructed on the apartment-living model, it houses approximately 500 students. When MICA proposed purchasing a lot on McMechen Street that had been vacant for more than 30 years, to build student housing, and the Bolton Hill neighborhood approved the purchase and donated $50,000. Built in 1991, and previously named \\"The Commons\\". In 2012, the building was renamed and renovated into the apartment-style by architecture firm, Ayers Saint Gross.The Gateway =Meyerhoff House= Meyerhoff House is a residence for Sophomore, Junior and Senior students. The building includes the College's main dining facility, student life center and recreational amenities. Originally built as the Hospital for the Women of Maryland, the building was used as nursing home for some time until it closed in 1994. The building was vacant for 7 years until MICA purchased it in January 2001. =The Gateway= The Gateway includes apartments to accommodate 217 student residents, a translucent studio tower, a multi-use performance space, the College's largest student exhibition gallery, and a new home for the Joseph Meyerhoff Center for Career Development. The Gateway is located at the intersection of Mount Royal and North avenues, alongside the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83). Construction began on The Gateway in October 2006 and completed in August 2008. It was designed by RTKL Associates Inc. In August 2008, the first students moved into the Gateway.

A truck body style variant was marketed until 1988. The 404 was manufactured under licence in various African countries until 1991 (in Kenya) and was manufactured in Argentina by Safrar/Sevel in El Palomar, in Québec, Canada at the St-Bruno-de-Montarville SOMA Ltd. plant and in Chile by Automotores Franco Chilena S.A. in Los Andes. Styled by Pininfarina, the 404 was offered initially as a saloon, estate, and pickup. A convertible was added in 1962, and a coupé in 1963. The 404 was fitted with a 1.6 litre petrol engine, with either a Solex carburetor or Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection or a 1.9 litre diesel engine available as options. Introduced at the Paris Motor Show as an option was the inclusion of a 3-speed ZF automatic transmission, similar to the unit already offered on certain BMW models, as an alternative to the standard column-mounted manual unit. Popular as a taxicab, the 404 enjoyed a reputation for durability and value. Peugeot's French production run of 1,847,568 404s ended in 1975. A total of 2,885,374 units had been produced worldwide at the end of production. Production history Peugeot 404 sedan 404 sedan in South Africa Peugeot 404 cabriolet Peugeot 404 Break L =1960= Saloon introduced with petrol engine and column-shift four-speed gearbox with gate \\"reversed\\" (first down, up for second, and towards the wheel for third down and fourth up) – identical to the 203 and 403 (except that fourth gear is direct drive). The grand touring model has square air vents on the dashboard and body-coloured wheels. Interior =1961= Introduction of the Super Luxe model: Superstructure painted silver, chrome headlight rims, large diameter hubcaps, tan leather interior trim, front armrest. The grand touring model has body colour wheels replaced with metallic silver ones. =1962= A new suspension with increased travel and flexibility was added. The dashboard was modified and square air vents were replaced by circular directional vents. New reinforced drum brake linings were installed. Anti-reflective paint was used for the dashboard. Introduction of Commerciale, Break and seven-seat Family estate versions,• Commerciale / Station Wagon (gasoline U6 and Diesel U6D): June; • Familiale / Family Saloon/Estate (L): September; • Break / Estate Car (U6A): February 1963; • Camionette bâchée / Canvas Top Van (U8, U8D, U10 & U10D): March 1967. See with tandem coil spring rear suspension in the place of the sedan's single spring arrangement. These versions have a balanced spring system to assist in opening the tailgate, different rear light clusters, rear bumper arrangement and the fuel filler cap is no longer hidden behind the rear number plate, but behind a flap in the rear wing. These variants are also longer ( compared to ) and heavier ( compared to ) than their saloon equivalents. =Convertible launch= The Peugeot 404 cabriolet/convertible made its first appearance at the Paris Motor Show in October 1961 and the accompanying coupé version was launched six months later. The convertible and coupé bodyshells were made by the Pinin Farina workshops in Turin and only the floorpan and mechanical elements were shared with the saloon. These models were initially powered by the same single carburetter engine as the saloon and the option of a fuel injected engine (XCKF1) with a Kugelfischer injection system was added to the range at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1962. The US$3,899 price in 1965http://www.nadaguides.com put the convertible in the same price bracket as the Jaguar E-Type in the American market. =1963= The 404 Super Luxe sedan has the fuel injection engine (XCKF) and has door cappings trimmed with leather The 404 grand touring sedan adopts painted side window trims instead of chrome The steering wheel and horn ring change The Family estate gains a split middle row of seats to improve access to the rear row The 404 coupé is introduced with the same body as the cabriolet but with a fixed roof Peugeot 404 coupé Peugeot 404 coupé =1964= The sedan carburetor engine adopts five bearings (XC5), as does the injection (XCKF1) Launch of the 404 diesel with Indenor engine (XD85), which is quickly replaced by the engine XD88, having a more powerful and reliable Bosch pump Rubber over-riders fitted on the bumper Bi-colour oval front indicator clusters fitted on coupés and convertibles (a similar design was used later on sedans and derivatives) =Year 1965= Injection engine XCKF1 () replaced by XCKF2, with power increased to . XC5 carburettor engine power increased to . Thermostable Hydrovac brakes servo- assisted by a mechanical vacuum manufactured by Bendix. The Super Luxe, coupé and convertible get eight-hole wheel covers cells instead of six-hole ones. New seat pads for Grand Touring, with cloth quilted to form longitudinal ridges similar to the 404 Super Luxe. All models are given reclining front seats. =Year 1966= The Grand Touring saloon is available with the XCKF2 injection engine. It was also available with a ZF automatic gearbox. The front indicator light clusters are now orange / white on all models. Two tone door linings (black top and bottom) on all models. Cigarette lighter fitted on Super Luxe only. Brake compensator fitted on petrol models. =Year 1967= The new XC6 carburetor engine fitted with increased power of net (80 bhp SAE). The engine bearings benefitted from improved shells. Rear anti roll bar fitted. New dashboard with three round dials, steering wheel is no longer adjustable. The spare wheel is relocated from inside the boot to under rear of the car. The rear valance is amended (Saloon only) and the capacity of the petrol tank is increased from (saloon). Cigarette lighter fitted on all models, Super Luxe has automatic light on lockable glovebox. The front of coupés and convertibles is redesigned, incorporating a new grille with integral driving lamps and rectangular indicator clusters. The convertible hood now has a \\"Panoramic\\" rear window and the seat mechanism is improved for better accessibility. In March, unveiling of the Camionnette bâchée / Canvas Top Van (pick-up). =Year 1968= 1968 Cabriolet showing later style grille and indicator clusters A 404 (8 CV) Comfort model is added to the range, having an identical engine displacement to the old 403 (although the engine is not from the 403, but a XC7, derived from the larger XC6 unit). It is an economy model, fitting into a lower French puissance fiscale (road tax) class than the 9 CV version. It has the former dashboard and bumpers without over riders. This is also the first model to benefit from front disc brakes. 8 CV cars are not imported into the UK, but some RHD models are produced for other markets. The last 404 Coupé and Cabriolet models were produced in October 1968, after a production run of 17,223 units. Reversing lamps are fitted to Super Luxe. New gearbox with European grid (BA7) fitted on all models in place of \\"C3\\" box. New steering wheel, dashboard modified. =Year 1969= Peugeot launches the 504. 404 Injection no longer offered, new door interior panels introduced. Front disc brakes fitted on all petrol models. =Year 1970–1972= In 1970, the 404 Super Luxe and 404 (8 CV) Comfort are discontinued, leaving the Grand Touring, Break and Family models to continue in petrol and diesel forms. The Grand Touring receives chrome headlight rims and reversing lights as standard. Wing-mounted indicator repeaters are no longer fitted. New XC7 engine fitted (de-tuned to ), but with torque equivalent to XC6. New front indicator clusters from 1971. Two-speed windscreen wipers introduced on the sedan 1972, with an optional rear screen demister. =Year 1973–1975= Water temperature gauge is replaced by warning lamp on dashboard, grille shield is replaced by lion. The optional automatic transmission (which is now 6 positions: PRN 3 2 1) is available until the end of 1974. In May 1975, production of European passenger models ceased. By this time Peugeot customers in Europe strongly favoured the newer 304 and 504 models, and French 404 production was much reduced, with only 15,780 – all berlines/saloons/sedans produced during the first five months of 1975.

It was manufactured by Safrar in Argentina (later Sevel) (162,583 cars built), and assembly took place in Australia (by the local Renault subsidiary – 8600 cars built), Belgium, Canada (about 3100 404 sedans were built at the SoMA plant shared with Renault), Chile (14,892 cars built), Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand (2800 cars built), Nigeria, Portugal, Perú (by Braillard), Rhodesia, South Africa (79,045 cars built), and Uruguay. In South Africa, where the 404 saloon continued in production until the end of 1978, the GL and Automatique versions received the more powerful XM7 engine also used in the 504. The GL also received front seats similar to those of the 504, as well as the 504's floor-mounted shifter with its characteristic bend. Late cars also have 504 steering wheels, as 404 parts were becoming scarce. The 404 Wagon was assembled until early 1976, when the supply of French CKD kits dried up. The 404, especially in pickup form, is still a common sight in North and West Africa. The Argentinian-built 404 was available with both the 1.6 petrol and the diesel engine, in Standard or Luxe equipment levels. The Luxe featured sporty alloy wheels and a special grille with integrated extra lamps. Surviving coupés and cabriolets Le Club 404 (France) is conducting a worldwide inventory of remaining 404 Coupé and Cabriolet cars. 17,223 were built – both variants included – and on October 14, 2020, 2,406 of these cars have been identified. That is 14% of the total that were made. 1364 of those cars have associated photographs on the Register website of Le Club 404. The URL for adding any model of Peugeot 404 to the Register of Le Club 404 is listed below under \\"external links\\". Road tests and press reviews =404 coupé injection= The 404 coupé with the desirable \\"KF2\\" fuel injected engine was tested by Motor magazine on December 4, 1965. The title of the article is \\"A First Class Job\\" and the rest of the article follows suit in praising the model, highlighting the car's remarkable performance and beauty. Even with of driver and test equipment on board, the car posted a acceleration time of 12.2 seconds, 18.8 seconds in the standing start and a top speed of . Fuel economy (over a shorter test distance than usual) was , which the author suggests would have improved had the usual test distance been completed. The punitive British taxes of the 1960s made this a very expensive car indeed, equivalent in cost to a Jaguar Mark X. Overall the conclusions of the review were that it was an excellent car. =404 saloon= Autocar magazine tested the fuel injected KF2 version of the 404 saloon/sedan in the spring of 1965. The testers summarized the car as follows: \\"100 MPH maximum and high cruising speeds; very well developed fuel injection giving easy starting and moderate fuel consumption; powerful fade-free drum brakes; accurate steering and good compromise suspension; comfortable seating with leather trim; sun-roof a standard fitting; priced rather high in the U.K.\\" Mean maximum speed was measured at with a best leg of ; the standing start was measured at 18.8 seconds. Overall fuel consumption was . Canada Track & Traffic Magazine also tested the Peugeot 404 with fuel injection in their May 1965 issue. The testers measured a time of 12.1 seconds, with a top speed of . A good cruising speed is , according to the article. \\"It is difficult to single out any one aspect of the Peugeot as being outstanding, for in truth the whole car is outstanding.\\" The writer concludes with: \\"To summarize, we can only say that the Peugeot 404 is a car that we find almost impossible to criticize, from any standpoint. It is a car that ideally combines comfort, quality and economy. In short, it is the kind of car one can buy with absolute confidence and drive and drive and drive, for longevity comes with quality in the case of Peugeot.\\" The 404 saloon was tested by Motor magazine in 1968. The styling was criticised as square cut, perpendicular and appearing rather dated, while the interior was considered \\"austere\\" compared to British cars of the time (the article includes a performance comparison with the Triumph 2000, Ford Corsair 2000E and Humber Sceptre). However, great praise is given for build quality, with the article stating that the car is suitable for African safaris and Arctic gales alike. =404 Familiale= The 404 was tested (in Family estate form) by Motor magazine in 1965. The car's quirks (the unusual original column-shift gearbox gate and awkward body roll at low speed) are listed. Build quality was praised and the interior described as \\"quietly tasteful\\", although the authors felt that the appeal of the car was limited. The car was tested again by Motor magazine five years later. The article is critical of the car's styling, calling it \\"square cut\\" and \\"hardly avant garde\\", but then relents and opts for \\"mature rather than dated\\" as its final comment. The ride is reported to improve as loading and speed increase. Of some concern to the testers was the driver's difficulty in reaching the handbrake when wearing a fixed seat-belt – inertia reel type belts would not have this problem. Alternative cars were listed as the Citroen Safari and Volvo 145. The car is described as having been used by one reader to transport the driver and 12 children. An article in The Times newspaper on French-made cars includes a comparison of the outgoing 404 with the 504. The performance of both cars (given their engine size) is praised. =404 Diesel= During the 1960s Peugeot, along with Mercedes-Benz, were pioneering large scale production of diesel engined passenger cars. The British \\"Autocar\\" magazine tested a Peugeot 404 Diesel in November 1965. The car had a top speed of and accelerated from in 25.5 seconds. An \\"overall\\" fuel consumption of was recorded. This compared with a top speed of , a time of 20 seconds and an overall fuel consumption of for the petrol version of the car which had recently been tested by the same journal and which (albeit without the diesel car's rev limiter) had exactly the same gear ratios. In terms of performance the Peugeot comfortably outperformed the diesel Austin Cambridge and the Mercedes Benz 190D also included in the comparison. The slower Austin nonetheless won on fuel economy. In terms of price, the 404 diesel was offered in the UK at £1,396 as against £1,093 for its petrol fuelled sibling. The manufacturer's recommended price for the Austin was just £875. The slower heavier Mercedes was not really pitched at the same market segment, being priced in the UK at £2,050. The testers described the Peugeot 404 Diesel as 'the fastest diesel yet'. They reported the characteristic diesel rattle when idling and the 'roar at high revs', but found the performance 'very reasonable'. They commended the sure-footed road holding, good steering, powerful fade-free brakes, the comfortable seats, the very good fuel economy and the prospect for a 'long attention-free life'. The 404 Diesel was tested again (in Family estate form) by Autocar magazine six years later. Top speed was improved on the previous test, , but acceleration to was poorer at 26.8 seconds. Notable features in the report were that the test car had broken two speedometer cables during testing. They mention its size twice: \\"wonderfully roomy\\" and \\"a big car for big men\\". The cars \\"oddities\\" are listed as the reverse-acting gearbox gate, window-sill door locks and windscreen wiper controls.

Project. She was a member and co-leader of the Japanese idol pop group Morning Musume. Yasuda, along with Mari Yaguchi and Sayaka Ichii, were the second generation of singers to be recruited into Morning Musume. Morning Musume had only released one official single, Morning Coffee, prior to their joining. Yasuda was also a member of Japanese pop idol group Dream Morning Musume.  Biography  Yasuda attended Kimitsu Shogyo (Commercial) High School in Futtsu City, Chiba Prefecture, but dropped out to pursue her dreams in the entertainment industry. She worked in a McDonald's restaurant in her hometown, until 1998. She was chosen to be in the second generation of Morning Musume. After they joined, Morning Musume went on to produce one album and three more singles until Asuka Fukuda decided to leave to pursue her studies. Yasuda was given almost all of Fukuda's lines in future performances of these early songs. She had also collaborated with other Morning Musume members in special projects during these early days. One of the more notable ones was when she co-wrote and co-sang with Natsumi Abe the song \\"Sanpo\\" for a radio contest. It became wildly popular and a petition was circulated to make it an official single, though that never happened. Yasuda and Ichii sang a particularly catchy duet known as \\"Otome no Shinrigaku\\" (Girl's Psychology) on Morning Musume's second album. In response to the popularity, Tsunku decided to group them together with the third generation member, Maki Goto to create the Morning Musume subgroup Petitmoni (also known as Pucchimoni) in 1999. Their first single, \\"Chokotto Love,\\" sold over a million copies. After Ichii left Morning Musume and Petitmoni, fourth generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa joined the subgroup. Yasuda had taken on the role of leader for Petitmoni and the group continued to produce three singles and an album. After Morning Musume's then-leader Yuko Nakazawa left in 2001, Yasuda (who was the oldest member of the group at the time) became a co-leader along with Kaori Iida. Yasuda left in mid-2003 at the same time when Morning Musume's 6th generation became full- fledged members. Tsunku commented that this one-time sixteen-member formation will be the largest Morning Musume. During her good-bye concert, Yasuda sang a remixed rock version of \\"Never Forget,\\" which was also Fukuda's good-bye song. Additionally, as a special gift, Tsunku gave Yasuda a CD of her own solo version of \\"As for One Day,\\" her last single with Morning Musume. Following Yasuda's leaving, Iida became the leader of Morning Musume and Yaguchi became sub-leader. The Petitmoni leadership was handed over to Yoshizawa, and two members were added (fifth generation Morning Musume member Makoto Ogawa and Coconuts Musume's Ayaka Kimura) and Goto left. This new line up of Petitmoni never had another release, but a few of their songs were featured on compilation albums. Yasuda was still in the Hello! Project after leaving the group, and acted in dramas outside of H!P. Within H!P, she has collaborated with Nakazawa and other H!P artists on two Folk Songs albums, performed and MC'd Abe's first solo concert, sang backup on Goto's single \\"Daite Yo! Please Go On,\\" and hosted Morning Musume's weekly TV show Hello! Morning until Rika Ishikawa took that position. Yasuda participated in the H.P. All Stars single \\"All for One & One For All\\" and the Puripuri Pink shuffle unit. Puripuri Pink was a new type of shuffle unit, since it was the first unit to feature former Morning Musume members, who were usually not included in the shuffles. During a promotional appearance on Utaban in 2004, Yasuda revealed that she has been learning how to play the flute. Yasuda graduated from Hello! Project on March 31, 2009, along with the rest of the H!P Elder Club. In 2010, it was announced that Kei Yasuda would be joining other former-Morning Musume members for the new group \\"Dream Morning Musume.\\"  Personal life  On May 29, 2013, Yasuda announced that she had married chef Kozaki Yoichi. On July 27, 2017, she has announced that she is pregnant with her first baby.  Musical groups  * Morning Musume (1998–2003) * Petitmoni * Kiiro 5 * 10-nin Matsuri * Odoru 11 * H.P.

It is an RPG spin-off series based on the original Mega Man series, taking place in a separate continuity where computer and networking technology advanced instead of robotics. There are six main Mega Man Battle Network games as well as several side-story games. It was later succeeded by the Mega Man Star Force series, which takes place hundreds of years after the Battle Network series. Plot The series is set in the year 200X (20XX in the sixth game), in an alternate version of the original Mega Man universe in which networks, rather than robots, were the subject of the most research. Like the original, there were two main projects and only one was funded, but unlike the original, the work of Dr. Tadashi Hikari (the series' version of Dr. Light) in the field of networking and AI programs had been funded over Dr. Wily's research in robotics. The result of Dr. Hikari's research was the PET (PErsonal Terminal), a small computer which is used similarly to a cellular phone or PDA and which contains a customizable artificial intelligence complete with emotions, known as a NetNavi (short for Network Navigator). A NetNavi is responsible for helping the operator search, use, and surf the internet as well as protect the PET and itself from viruses. Within years the internet evolves to the point where it becomes possible to send an AI into it and physically move around as if it were another world. There is some danger, however; viruses evolve alongside Navis and the internet to become intelligent on some level. Because the internet has evolved to the point of taking on a manifestation, so, too, can virtual weapons be used. If a Navi or a Virus takes too much damage, its programming will lose integrity, disperse, and be deleted shortly afterwards. Each Navi has antiviral weapons that are built directly into its programming that provide basic defense, and can, in addition to this, be sent weapon programs from the PET via the use of BattleChips. The series focuses on Tadashi's grandson, Lan Hikari, and his NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE. The pair get involved in foiling the schemes of a net-crime organization called WWW (\\"World Three\\"), headed by Wily. In another tribute to the original series, most of the Navis in the series are named after characters from the original series. As the games progressed, however, certain characters from the X series, such as Zero, Iris, and Colonel have also appeared as NetNavis. Completely original NetNavis have also been made for the series, with some exclusive to the anime series. In every game since the second (with the exception of Battle Network 3), NetNavis used by Mr. Famous were created by fans of the series, being winners of design contests from Capcom of Japan. Gameplay  MegaMan.EXE (left) while fighting two viruses. = Battle System = The series uses a hybrid action-RPG/card battle system. Battle screens feature a 6x3 grid, with each character initially controlling half of the playing field, which can be modified by Battle Chips. Like the original games, the player is in control of MegaMan who has the use of his weapon, the MegaBuster. However, core gameplay revolves around \\"Battle Chips\\" which are selected by Lan who is also controlled by the player. The chips are selected at the beginning of a battle and every time the player activates the full \\"Custom Gauge\\" which refills over time. Selection takes place during a pause in the battle. Specific selections of Battle Chips lead to \\"Program Advances\\" which combine chips to form a more powerful temporary Battle Chip. The player must choose 30 Battle Chips which act as a deck for each battle and is refilled after each battle ends. A secondary objective is the collection of Battle Chips which can range in rarity from common to Mega to Giga. With the success of the collectible genre with series such as Pokémon, Battle Network games (beginning with BN3) were released in two similar versions, and had content that were exclusive to one version of the game. = Exploration = Lan Hikari travels in the real world in Mega Man Battle Network 5. Exploration in the game takes place in two ways. First, the player controls the protagonist Lan Hikari in the real world, where the player can interact with other Non-player characters, and travel around the world map. These real-world areas allow the player to progress the story, and do side-quests as well. The real-world also contains jack-in points in which the player can jack-in to the net world, and explore as Megaman.EXE. The net world is where the player controls and plays as Megaman. While traveling in the Net World, battles can ensue at random, and to progress the story, Megaman must travel through these Net Areas in order to defeat enemies, and fix issues with the machines these areas are located within. Games =Mega Man Battle Network= A terrorist organization called WWW (World Three) attempted to destroy the world with the use of a super virus known as the Life Virus. Despite interference by Lan and MegaMan, the members stole the four element programs they needed in order to make it and succeeded in its creation. The virus was as strong as predicted, but was destroyed by MegaMan. Its defeat forced WWW to retreat. This game received an averaged score of 80% score on GameRankings and 79% on MetaCritic. Mega Man Battle Network was later re-released for the DS as Rockman EXE Operate Shooting Star, which serves both as an enhanced port of the original, as well as a crossover with the Star Force series. As stated, in an inside-Games Interview, by the game developers, the game was initially conceptualized with the intention of being a horror game.http://www.rockman-corner.com/2016/03/mega-man-battle-network-started- out-as.html =Mega Man Network Transmission= A man known only as the Professor releases a deadly virus that infects Navis. MegaMan and ProtoMan move in to investigate and find the source of the virus, Zero. Once Zero is released of the curse, the Professor announces that Zero was merely a diversion to resurrect the Life Virus. With Zero's help, MegaMan deletes it again. The game takes place in the Battle Network universe, but the gameplay is unlike the hybrid action-RPG/card battle system of the other games. Instead, it is an action Platformer similar to the traditional Megaman series. The game received a 61% score on GameRankings and 65% on MetaCritic. =Mega Man Battle Network 2= The following summer after WWW's defeat, a new terrorist group called Gospel emerges. Their tactics differed considerably compared to WWW, as they appeared to have no set goal. Gospel's plan had seemingly consisted of only causing random destruction with their navis. Lan and MegaMan battled every member and prevented the worst possible situations. However, Gospel's hidden plan was to re-create the ultimate net navi, Bass. Using bug fragments, they planned to make a large army of Bass navis to take over the world. Unknown to Gospel, their method of creating Bass was imperfect, and his abilities were vastly below predictions. In an attempt to make copies of Bass to create an army, the leader of Gospel overloaded energy to the bug fragments; but something went wrong and the concoction transformed into a giant wolf-like multi-bug organism. Although the bug beast was stronger than before, Lan and MegaMan managed to eliminate it. This game received an averaged score of 82% score on GameRankings and 81% on MetaCritic. =Rockman EXE WS= Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE face off against the WWW. The story adapts aspects of both the first Mega Man Battle Network game as well as the anime series, MegaMan NT Warrior. The game play is similar to that of Mega Man Network Transmission. =Mega Man Battle Network 3 (Blue and White)= Battle Network 3 takes place not long after BN2. Lan and MegaMan participate in a NetNavi tournament called the N1 Grand Prix get into the competition, but discover the tournament is a set-up by WWW to intimidate the world about their return, and to initiate the revival of the net beast Alpha. This game received an averaged score of 77% on GameRankings and 77% on MetaCritic. = Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge = Lan competes in a new netbattling tournament known as the \\"Battle Chip GP\\", but there is a new organization behind the scenes who will delete the winning Navi and steal its data. The gameplay of Battle Chip Challenge is very different from the gameplay of the other Battle Network games. It uses the same chips from Megaman Battle Network 1 and 2, but instead of having a hybrid action-RPG/card battle system, it uses the battlechips instead in a more strategy based style. The game received a 49.9% score on GameRankings and 54% on MetaCritic. =Mega Man Battle Network 4 (Red Sun and Blue Moon)= Lan and MegaMan take part in a series of net battle tournaments. Depending on the version of the game, different opponents and scenarios will occur. In between tournaments, a criminal organization called Nebula attack. They spread corruption with the use of Dark Chips, Battle Chips infused with the power of darkness. Meanwhile, an asteroid is traveling through space, heading for Earth. This game received an averaged score of 70% on GameRankings and 68% on MetaCritic (the low scores on this title were due to lack of any real story other than fighting in tournaments). =Mega Man Battle Network 5 (Team Protoman/Colonel/Double Team DS)= Nebula attacks again, this time with an all-out invasion. They kidnap Lan's father and use SciLab's computers to take over the internet. In response, either Chaud or Baryl (depending on the version) create a team of elite net navis and operators. Lan and MegaMan are the first members. As the story progresses, more team members are gained, and more areas of the net are liberated. When all of the net is won back, the team locates Nebula's headquarters and attempt to defeat the organization. The GBA versions received an average score of 68% on GameRankings and 67% on MetaCritic, whereas the NDS version received 70% on GameRankings and 68% on MetaCritic. =Mega Man Battle Network 6 (Cybeast Gregar and Cybeast Falzar)= Battle Network 6 is the final game in the series. Lan's father gets a new job and the family moves to Cyber City, leaving behind Lan's classmates and friends from ACDC Town. WWW attacks once again, aiming to revive the legendary Cybeasts, Gregar and Falzar. This game received an average score of 64% on GameRankings and 63% on Metacritic (the low scores were due to recycled art, sound, and gameplay). Other media =Anime= The games were adapted into an anime series titled MegaMan NT Warrior. The series spawned four seasons, Axess, Stream, Beast, and Beast+. =Manga= The games were adapted into two manga series by Shogakukan titled MegaMan NT Warrior by Ryo Takamisaki that consisted of 13 volumes and Battle Story Rockman.EXE by Keijima Jun and Miho Asada that consisted of 4 volumes. =Board game= In 2004 Capcom released ロックマン エグゼ カタン スタンダード (2004) — \\"Rockman.EXE Catan Standard\\" — a licensed version of The Settlers of Catan.

Until 2018, parts of the building were used as teaching laboratories in which undergraduate students were trained in practical organic chemistry. It was founded with an endowment from Charles Dyson Perrins, heir to the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce company, and stands on the north side of South Parks Road in Oxford. Notable chemists The heads of the laboratory were the four consecutive Waynflete Professors of Chemistry: # William Henry Perkin, Jr., from 1912 to 1929; # Sir Robert Robinson, from 1930 to 1954. Nobel Prize winner, 1947; # Sir Ewart Jones, from 1954 to 1978; # Sir Jack Baldwin, from 1978 to 2003. During its 87-year working life, the laboratory had an extremely distinguished career; it can claim a stake in shaping the scientific careers of two Nobel Laureates, namely Lord Todd (1957) and Sir John W. Cornforth (1975) who passed their formative years as young chemists in the laboratories. History and present use The Royal Society of Chemistry commemorative plaque, 2004 The building of the laboratory began in 1913 and was finished in 1916 to the designs of Paul Waterhouse, the contractors being Armitage and Hodgson of Leeds. Funding came in part from C. W. Dyson Perrins of Queen's College. In 1920–22 an eastern wing was added as contemplated in the original design, this was followed in 1934 by an extension for medical students and in 1940–41 a new brick wing to the north was built.\\"The University Press and other modern buildings\\", in: A History of the County of Oxford; Volume 3: The University of Oxford (1954), pp. 56-60 Research in organic chemistry at Oxford is now conducted across South Parks Road at the University's state-of-the-art Chemistry Research Laboratory.

She was the founding editor of Broadside magazine, which she published with her husband Gordon Friesen and their daughters. Early life Agnes Cunningham was born in Oklahoma in 1909, the daughter of Ada Boyce and William Cunningham, Schrems, Suzanne, \\"Cunningham, Agnes\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture Blaine County, Oklahoma [small farmer], fiddler. Her father was a socialist and follower of Eugene Debs, socialist leader. As a child, she learned piano, accordion, and musical arrangement. In 1929, she attended the Weatherford (Oklahoma) Teachers' College where she studied music. After graduating from Weatherford Teachers' College, Agnes Cunningham worked in the public school system teaching music. In 1932, Agnes Cunningham went on to the Commonwealth Labor College near Mena, Arkansas, where she studied labor organizing and Marxism. [Pietaro, 2004].Folkways.si.edu Retrieved on 15-12-15 During her time there, Agnes Cunningham also studied labor journalism and labor-farmer union development as well as learned about social theatre. During this time, she started to write labor songs. Completing her coursework and moving back to Oklahoma, Agnes Cunningham began recruiting for the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union. Career In 1937, she became a music teacher at the Southern Labor School for Women in North Carolina. She taught politically oriented music, including labor-union standards, political songs such as those written by Bertholt Brecht and Hanns Eisler, and topical songs, including some of her own original compositions. [Pietaro, 2004] In late 1939 or early 1940, she was a founding member of the Red Dust Players, an agit-prop group in Oklahoma that promoted propaganda and political agitation through short plays. Performing throughout the countryside in Oklahoma at union meetings, the Red Dust Players sought to educate tenant- farmers, sharecroppers, and farm workers on how the union could benefit them. Fleeing harassment, she and fellow Communist Party member Gordon Friesen married on July 23, 1941 in the course of fleeing to New York City. [Pietaro, 2004]. In New York, they moved into the Greenwich Village household known as Almanac House: housemates included Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, and Cunningham was briefly a member of the Almanac Singers, appearing on the 1942 album Dear Mr. President for Keynote Records. After attempting unsuccessfully to start a Detroit, Michigan, equivalent of the Almanacs, she took a job in a defense plant, while Friesen went to work as a reporter for the Detroit Times. In 1945, Agnes Cunningham was on the founding committee of People's Songs, an organization founded on December 31, 1945 in New York City by Pete Seeger, Alan Lomax, Lee Hays and many others. People's Songs went bankrupt in 1948, but the People's Songs Bulletin served as a template for Broadside Magazine that was later co-founded by Agnes Cunningham. Sis Cunningham was also a songwriter: her \\"How Can You Keep on Movin' (Unless You Migrate Too)?\\" found its way into the New Lost City Ramblers' 1959 album Songs of the Depression, and following them, Ry Cooder also recorded it, as a strident march, on his album Into the Purple Valley; Cooder was unaware of its authorship and attributed it as \\"Traditional\\" http://home.earthlink.net/~jimcapaldi/Brdside1.htm Home.earthlink.net Retrieved on 06-01-07 until the omission was pointed out to him; he and the label corrected the attribution on later pressings: see Track listing of Into the Purple Valley. Her Dust Bowl tale \\"My Oklahoma Home\\", written with her brother Bill Cunningham, was performed by Seeger in 1961, fell into oblivion, and then was revived by Bruce Springsteen in 2006 for his We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions album and subsequent Seeger Sessions Band Tour. A lasting contribution of Sis Cunningham and Gordon Friesen was to publish a little magazine for 26 years: Broadside, which printed the words and music to newly written folk and topical songs by Bob Dylan, Malvina Reynolds, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Tom Paxton, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and many others. Recordings of songs that had been published in their magazine were collected in 2000 in a 5-CD set, The Best of Broadside, on Smithsonian Folkways, which received two Grammy nominations.New York Times, June 30, 2004 Despite Agnes Cunningham being out of the music scene for years, she and her husband were able to start Broadside when Seeger provided them with a subsidy for the endeavor in 1962. Agnes and her husband started Broadside, mimeographing it on a machine inherited from the American Labour Party. The couple had to smuggle out copies of Broadside because the housing project that they lived in did not allow domestic commercial ventures. Many young musicians, including Dylan, Phil Ochs, Gil Turner, and many more, recorded tunes inside Agnes Cunningham's family apartment. She would transcribe the songs, both lyrics and musical notation, while Gordon Friesen wrote the commentary. Even though Broadside's circulation did not surpass four figures, it became influential across the country. Agnes Cunningham continued to be politically active, taking part in events such as hootenannies despite her advancing age. She and Broadside Magazine continued to influence and inspire topical music, with Broadside reaching its apex around 1970. 1945 to 1962 After World War II, Cunningham and Friesen were among the first victims of the anti-communist blacklist. She secured a few bookings as part of the roster of Pete Seeger's booking agency, People's Songs, but between ill health, trying to raise a family in poverty, and personal depression, she largely fell out of the music world for over a decade. [Pietaro, 2004]. In 1962, Cunningham reemerged into the public eye as the founding editor of Broadside magazine. This magazine published the songs of many of the 1960s' most influential topical songwriters, including Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Tom Paxton, The Freedom Singers, Buffy Sainte Marie, Len Chandler, and Malvina Reynolds. Although the magazine, in John Pietaro's words \\"a vital part of the folk revival\\", survived until 1988, it was always a shoestring operation — several times, subsidies from Pete Seeger and his wife Toshi Seeger kept it afloat. [Pietaro, 2004]. Among its legacies was a five-CD box set called The Best of Broadside, 1962–1988. In 1976, Folkways Records released Broadside Ballads, Vol. 9: Sundown, Cunningham's only solo album on the label (though she had been featured on several other albums, including Seeger's Broadside Ballads, Vol. and Phil Ochs' Broadside Tapes 1). Later years During most of their later lives, Cunningham and Friesen lived on West 98th Street in Manhattan,[Pietaro, 2004] with their daughter Jane Friesen, grand daughter Ellie Thomas, and great grandson Nicholas Toth. Toward the end of their lives they wrote a \\"joint autobiography\\", Red Dust and Broadsides. Friesen died in 1996, Cunningham in 2004. [Pietaro, 2004].

Based on the 3GPP2 technical specification published on 18 May 2007. The 3GP and 3G2 file formats are both structurally based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12, but older versions of the 3GP file format did not use some of its features. 3GP and 3G2 are container formats similar to MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4), which is also based on MPEG-4 Part 12. The 3GP and 3G2 file format were designed to decrease storage and bandwidth requirements to accommodate mobile phones. They are good for lower end smartphones for faster streaming & download. 3GP and 3G2 are similar standards, but with some differences: * 3GPP file format was designed for GSM- based phones and may have the filename extension \`.3gp\` * 3GPP2 file format was designed for CDMA-based phones and may have the filename extension \`.3g2\` Some cell phones use the .mp4 extension for 3GP video. =3GP= The 3GP file format stores video streams as MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263, or MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264), and audio streams as AMR-NB, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AAC-LC, HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2). 3GPP allowed use of AMR and H.263 codecs in the ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12), because 3GPP specified the usage of the Sample Entry and template fields in the ISO base media file format as well as defining new boxes to which codecs refer. These extensions were registered by the registration authority for code-points in ISO base media file format (\\"MP4 Family\\" files). For the storage of MPEG-4 media specific information in 3GP files, the 3GP specification refers to MP4 and the AVC file format, which are also based on the ISO base media file format. The MP4 and the AVC file format specifications described usage of MPEG-4 content in the ISO base media file format. A 3GP file is always big-endian, storing and transferring the most significant bytes first. =3G2= The 3G2 file format can store the same video streams and most of the audio streams used in the 3GP file format. In addition, 3G2 stores audio streams as EVRC, EVRC-B, EVRC-WB, 13K (QCELP), SMV or VMR-WB, which was specified by 3GPP2 for use in ISO base media file format. The 3G2 specification also defined some enhancements to 3GPP Timed Text. 3G2 file format does not store Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2) and AMR-WB+ audio streams. For the storage of MPEG-4 media (AAC audio, MPEG-4 Part 2 video, MPEG-4 Part 10 – H.264/AVC) in 3G2 files, the 3G2 specification refers to the MP4 file format and the AVC file format specification, which described usage of this content in the ISO base media file format. For the storage of H.263 and AMR content 3G2 specification refers to the 3GP file format specification. Device support *Most 3G capable mobile phones support the playback and recording of video in 3GP format (memory, maximum filesize for playback and recording, and resolution limits exist and vary). *Some newer/higher-end phones without 3G capabilities may also playback and record in this format (again, with said limitations). *Audio imported from CD onto a PlayStation 3 when it is set to encode to the MPEG-4 AAC format copies onto USB devices in the 3GP format. *The Nintendo 3DS used 3GP technology to play YouTube videos. *Apple iDevices used to support files for playback only as passthrough files, hence no editing ability, but since iOS 9 this has been deprecated meaning files of this format have to be manually converted to H.264. Software support When transferred to a computer, 3GP movies can be viewed on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and the various Linux-based operating systems; on the former two with Windows Media Player and Apple QuickTime respectively (their built-in media players), and on all three with VLC media player. Programs such as Media Player Classic, K-Multimedia Player, Totem, RealPlayer, MPlayer, and GOM Player can also be used. 3GP files can be encoded and decoded with open source software FFmpeg.

He was the head coach of the University of Wisconsin–Madison Badgers men's basketball team from 2001 to December 2015. Ryan served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville from 1984 to 1999 and at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee from 1999 to 2001. His overall collegiate coaching record was 747–233. Ryan was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. Playing career Ryan began playing basketball at a very young age. His father, Butch Ryan was already a legend in the area, coaching youth sports including basketball to under-privileged children in Chester, Pennsylvania. Butch taught him the skills to be a successful point guard, generally the position of the on-court team leader. He became a star basketball player, leading his high school team to a 25–1 record in his senior year. In addition to basketball, Ryan was a high school quarterback. The center snapping him the ball was Ted Cottrell, who later served as a defensive coach and coordinator for a number of teams in the NFL. Ryan lettered in football, basketball and baseball, and was president of his class. After high school, Ryan starred as a point guard at Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. His love for the game drove him to remain involved with the sport, choosing to delve into the coaching profession. Coaching career =Early years= After a playing career at Wilkes University, Ryan graduated in 1969, and began graduate work, attending Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania. Ryan's coaching career began in 1972 at Brookhaven Junior High School in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where for one year he worked as a history teacher and basketball head coach. In 1973, Ryan began his collegiate coaching career at Dominican College of Racine in Racine, Wisconsin. He won a Coach of the Year award as head baseball coach at Dominican while serving as an assistant basketball coach under Bill Cofield. In 1974, Dominican College closed down. Ryan then became head basketball coach at Sun Valley High School in Aston, Pennsylvania in 1974, where he was named conference coach of the year in 1976. His success at Dominic College and Sun Valley led to a job as assistant head coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under head coaches Bill Cofield and Steve Yoder from 1976 to 1984. =Wisconsin–Platteville (1984-1999)= After his stint as an assistant, Ryan accepted the head coaching position at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville. From 1984 until 1999, Ryan's Platteville team posted a 352–76 overall record, an .820 winning percentage. Ryan guided the UW–Platteville Pioneers to four national championships (1991, 1995, 1998 and 1999). He also won eight Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships and set a Division III scoring defense record in 1997, with his team only allowing 47.5 points per game. During Ryan's tenure, UW-Platteville was the winningest NCAA men's basketball team of the 1990s (all divisions) with a 266-26 (.908) record. On January 27, 2007, UW-Platteville officially honored Ryan's 15-year tenure by naming the playing surface at Williams Fieldhouse \\"Bo Ryan Court\\". Ryan, along with the 2007 Wisconsin Badgers team, attended the event. =Wisconsin-Milwaukee (1999-2001)= On the strength of his success at Platteville, Ryan was hired as head coach at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for the 1999–2000 season. In his two seasons as coach, the team had its first back-to-back winning seasons in nearly a decade. Ryan also brought a 161 percent increase in home attendance at UWM, giving the program a new energy that continued into the tenure of his successor Bruce Pearl. =Wisconsin (2001-2015)= Following the Badgers' 2000 Final Four run, head coach Dick Bennett retired two games into the 2000–01 season. Assistant coach Brad Soderberg finished the season as interim head coach, but was not considered for the full-time job. The coaching search began to concentrate on Rick Majerus of the University of Utah (who was a Milwaukee native) and Bo Ryan. After Majerus pulled his name out of consideration, UW athletic director Pat Richter made the decision to hire Ryan as Wisconsin's 13th head coach. Ryan's first season was much more successful than anticipated. The team was predicted to finish as low as ninth in the Big Ten in pre-season polls. The team, led by Kirk Penney, surprisingly finished in a four-way tie for the Big Ten regular-season title and received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. In the 2002–03 season, the Badgers won their first outright Big Ten regular season title in 56 years and advanced to the \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" in the NCAA Tournament. The Badgers won the Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2004, led by Devin Harris, and once again received an NCAA Tournament invitation. In the 2004–05 season, Wisconsin advanced to the \\"Elite Eight\\" in the NCAA Tournament, losing to the eventual national champion North Carolina Tar Heels. On December 10, 2005, Ryan recorded his 100th victory as Wisconsin head coach by defeating in-state rival Marquette. In the 2006–07 season, Ryan led the Badgers to the pinnacle of college basketball, helping them achieve their first top-five ranking and #1 ranking in the AP poll in the school's history. However, the Badgers' time atop the poll was short-lived as they lost their next game, against Michigan State before losing to Ohio State in a #1 vs. #2 matchup. The Wisconsin–Ohio State game on February 25, 2007, featured two teams ranked #1 in that week's national polls, with Ohio State securing the top ranking in the Coaches' Poll and clinching the regular season Big Ten title. The following week they rebounded with a 52–50 win at home over Michigan State and again defeated Michigan State in the Big Ten tournament, before losing the Big Ten Tournament championship game to Ohio State. In 2007, Ryan was named the winner of the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award. A year later, the Badgers notched their most wins ever in Big Ten play (16) en route to a school-record 31 wins. On December 12, 2009, Ryan recorded his 200th victory as Wisconsin head coach by defeating in-state rival Marquette, 72–63 at the Kohl Center. On January 24, 2010, Ryan recorded his 100th Big Ten Conference victory by defeating Penn State, 79–71 at the Kohl Center. With that victory, Ryan became the 2nd fastest coach to reach that milestone, tying Ryan with Branch McCracken who both needed 140 games to reach the 100th conference victory. The only coach to reach the 100th conference win faster was Bob Knight, who only needed 131 games. On March 9, 2012, in the 2012 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament quarterfinals the Badgers defeated the Hoosiers, giving Ryan his 266th win at Wisconsin and vaulting him past Bud Foster to become the winningest coach in school history. On December 4, 2013, Ryan won his 300th game at Wisconsin during a 48–38 victory over Virginia becoming only the ninth Big Ten head coach to win 300 games. On March 14, 2014, Ryan got his 700th victory during an 83–57 win over Minnesota in the 2014 Big Ten Tournament. On March 29, 2014, during the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Ryan reached his first Division I Final Four with a 64–63 overtime win over Arizona. On January 8, 2015, the Badgers defeated Purdue 62–55 giving Ryan his 159th Big Ten victory, passing Walter Meanwell for most Big Ten conference victories in UW history. On February 14, 2015, Ryan was named a finalist to be considered for election in the Class of 2015 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. On December 15, 2015, Ryan announced his retirement as head coach of the Badgers. Ryan has written three books: Bo Ryan: Another Hill to Climb, The Swing Offense, and Passing and Catching: the Lost Art. He led the Badgers to the NCAA Tournament in each of his 14 full seasons at Wisconsin; the team had only been to a total of seven NCAA Tournaments before Ryan's arrival (three of them under Bennett). He also owns all four of Wisconsin's 30-win seasons. He coached the Badgers to the NCAA Final Four two years in a row, falling to Kentucky, 74-73, in the 2014 semifinals in Arlington, Texas, and to Duke, 68-63, in the championship game on April 6, 2015 in Indianapolis. On June 29, 2015, Ryan announced that he would retire after the 2015-16 season, naming associate head coach Greg Gard, who had been on Ryan's staff at both UW-Platteville and Milwaukee, as his preferred successor.Bo Ryan Lobbies Hard for Greg Gard, accessed August 13, 2015 A month and a half later, Ryan announced he was \\"not totally sure\\" whether or not he would retire.Bo Ryan Not Totally Sure He Will Retire, accessed August 13, 2016 On December 15, 2015, Ryan announced his retirement after a win against Texas A&M;–Corpus Christi, effective immediately, and Gard took over for the rest of the season., accessed December 15, 2015 Personal life Ryan and his wife, Kelly, have five children: Megan, Will, Matt, Brenna and Mairin. Ryan also has six grandchildren: Aoife, Imogen, Maeve, Owen, Liam and Callen. Shortly after the Badgers' loss in the 2015 NCAA title game, there was speculation Ryan would retire when he and his wife put their home in Madison up for sale. At a charity fundraiser, he explained that they had chosen to downsize now that their children were all adults and out of the house, and had bought a condo near the Badgers' home of the Kohl Center. The house was ultimately purchased by new Wisconsin football head coach Paul Chryst.

It is a follow up to the city's earlier Computer Leasing Inquiry, and is investigating three other questionable contracts. However, as with the earlier inquiry, the External Contracts Inquiry is commissioned by Madam Justice Denise Bellamy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.http://www.toronto.ca/inquiry/inquiry_site/commissioner/index.html The External Contracts Inquiry was established by Toronto City Council on October 1, 2002, as an expansion of the Computer Leasing Inquiry. It began hearings on October 18, 2004, after the Computer Leasing Inquiry ended. TMACS The first contract investigated by the External Contracts Inquiry involved the city's tax and billing management system. On January 1, 1998, the city of Toronto and its five suburban cities (Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke, East York and York) were amalgamated into the single \\"megacity\\" of Toronto. During the amalgamation process, the six municipal governments had to merge their computer systems. Five of the municipalities used a system called TXM, while North York used a system called TMACS. North York's treasurer, Wanda Liczyk, was the sole voice in favour of adopting TMACS for the amalgamated city, and when she subsequently became treasurer of the \\"megacity\\", she implemented TMACS without consulting city council. TMACS was developed for North York's city government by two American software consultants, David Maxson and Michael Saunders. Testimony before the inquiry has confirmed that from 1989 to 1991, Saunders and Liczyk had a personal romantic relationship. Although their relationship ended before Saunders was contracted by the city of Toronto, city staff have testified that Liczyk and Saunders still had a close friendship. In her testimony to the inquiry, Liczyk has acknowledged that her relationship with Saunders may have created the appearance of favouritism in her decisions involving Saunders. However, in response to suggestions that she should have declared a conflict of interest and recused herself from such decisions, Liczyk has testified that she is able to separate personal and business matters. It has also been testified that Saunders was often rude and abrasive to city staff. Other Contracts Two other city contracts will be investigated by the Inquiry. Testimony around these contracts has not yet been presented.

Nicolaus II Bernoulli, a.k.a. Niklaus Bernoulli, Nikolaus Bernoulli (6 February 1695, Basel, Switzerland – 31 July 1726, St. Petersburg, Russia) was a Swiss mathematician as were his father Johann Bernoulli and one of his brothers, Daniel Bernoulli. He was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. Work Nicolaus worked mostly on curves, differential equations, and probability. He was a friend and contemporary of Leonhard Euler, who studied under Nicolaus' father. He also contributed to fluid dynamics. He was older brother of Daniel Bernoulli, to whom he also taught mathematics. Even in his youth he had learned several languages. From the age of 13, he studied mathematics and law at the University of Basel. In 1711 he received his Master's of Philosophy; in 1715 he received a Doctorate in Law. In 1716-17 he was a private tutor in Venice. From 1719 he had the Chair in Mathematics at the University of Padua, as the successor of Giovanni Poleni. He served as an assistant to his father, among other areas, in the correspondence over the priority dispute between Isaac Newton and Leibniz, and also in the priority dispute between his father and the English mathematician Brook Taylor. In 1720 he posed the problem of reciprocal orthogonal trajectories, which was intended as a challenge for the English Newtonians. From 1723 he was a law professor at the Berner Oberen Schule. In 1725 he together with his brother Daniel, with whom he was touring Italy and France at this time, was invited by Peter the Great to the newly founded St. Petersburg Academy. Eight months after his appointment he came down with a fever and died. His professorship was succeeded in 1727 by Leonhard Euler, whom the Bernoulli brothers had recommended. His early death cut short a promising career.

Founded in 1966 in Vicenza, Veneto, its atelier is located within an 18th-century villa in Montebello Vicentino. Its headquarters are in Lugano, Switzerland, with offices in Milan and Vicenza, Italy. In 2001, Bottega Veneta was purchased by Gucci Group, and it is now part of the French conglomerate Kering. In September 2016, it was announced that Claus-Dietrich Lahrs would become CEO, replacing Carlo Beretta. BV in Paris History Bottega Veneta was established in 1966 in Vicenza, Italybusinessoffashion.com IMRAN AMED, Carlo Beretta on Operation ‘€2 Billion Bottega Veneta’ MAY 31, 2016 by entrepreneurs Michele Taddei and Renzo Zengiaro. Michele Taddei was then married to Laura Braggion who developed the company alongside him. Years later, after Michele Taddei would leave and Vittorio and Laura Moltedo (Laura had previously been married to Taddei) took over the brand. The company, born from the name \\"Venetian Shop\\" in Italian, was founded the producing of artisanal leather goods. The company developed a distinctive leather weave design, called intrecciato, that was used on the exterior of many of its products, and became widely associated with the Bottega Veneta brand.Bottega Veneta - history and brand profile, Retrieved on 28 November 2011. Intrecciato was the starting point for Bottega Veneta's evolution, and continues to be one of the most recognizable elements of the brand. In the 1970s, the company began advertising with the tag line “When your own initials are enough\\". By the early 1980s, Bottega Veneta was a favorite of the international jet set, with clients including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the empress Farah Pahlavi. Andy Warhol made a short film for the company in 1980. Zengiaro and Taddei retired from the company in the 1990s. During the 1980s, Bottega Veneta's fortunes began to decline. In a miscue, the company changed its image and began emblazoning a BV logo on its products. In February 2001, the struggling company was acquired by Gucci Group for $156 million. Tom Ford, then Gucci Group's Creative Director, hired Tomas Maier, who had previously worked at Sonia Rykiel and Hermès, as Bottega Veneta's Creative Director in June of that year. After receiving total creative control from product and store design to advertising, Tomas Maier set about returning the brand to its original identity. He removed visible logos from the brand's products, highlighted the signature intrecciato weave, and returned the company's focus to artisanal production. Vogue described the change of image as an emerging example of “stealth wealth.” Bottega Veneta presented its first women's ready- to-wear runway show in February 2005 and its first men's runway show in June 2006. In April 2006, the company launched its first jewelry line and branched out into interiors and furniture design. In September 2016, the Bottega Veneta celebrated its 50-year anniversary as a company at its annual fashion show at the Brera Academy in Milan. The event also celebrated Tomas Maier's 15th year as creative director. During first quarter 2019, the Bottega Veneta's marketing team found moderate viral success in their Facebook Ad Campaign. Collaborations Bottega Veneta collaborates with notable photographers on its advertising campaigns such as, in the company's \\"Art of Collaboration\\" series, Jürgen Teller (Fall 2015), Robert Longo (Fall 2010), and Nan Goldin (Spring 2010). In 2012, Bottega Veneta published its first book to celebrate its history and craftsmanship. The book is the result of a collaborative effort between Maier himself, book designer Sam Shahid, and others in fashion journalism. Fashion editors contributed to each chapter by describing Maier's designs of handbags, small leather goods, luggage, shoes, women's ready-to- wear, jewelry, men's ready-to-wear, furniture, home accessories, watches, and fragrances. The book discusses the handcrafted production of Bottega Veneta's luxury goods and features their signature intrecciato weave design, including an intrecciato slip-cover. A second book detailing the \\"Art of Collaboration\\" project was published in October 2015. The atelier in Montebello Vicentino In 2013, Bottega Veneta inaugurated its new atelier in Montebello Vicentino. The complex, restored and constructed with an eye to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) guidelines, was overseen by Maier. Maier has said that keeping Bottega Veneta's operations in Vicenza is essential to maintaining the traditions and ideals of the brand. The atelier is also the new home to La Scuola dei Maestri Pellettieri di Bottega Veneta, the company's school for training its employees, as well as the Bottega Veneta archives and museum. Originally started in the summer of 2006, Bottega Veneta opened the school to train and support future generations of leather artisans in recognition of the importance of artisanal craftsmanship and the diminishing number of master leatherworkers in Italy. Its students must complete three- year courses in the classroom before they are allowed to work in the atelier proper. In the introduction to Bottega Veneta's 2012 book, Maier wrote that \\"it would be a profound loss if the knowledge and cultural wealth embodied in artisanal crafts were to vanish. Such know-how carries within it precious threads of individual creativity and human history.\\" La Scuola dei Maestri Pellettieri di Bottega Veneta also collaborated with The University IUAV of Venice to design a post-graduate course in handbag design and product development. The course provided students with professional-level experience in multiple sectors of the industry, from the beginning of the design process, through manufacturing and production, and to the sale of products in a Bottega Veneta store. Boutiques There are 251 boutiques in 43 countries owned by Bottega Veneta, and their products are distributed across Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and North America. In September 2013, Bottega Veneta unveiled its first \\"Maison,\\" within a historical building on Milan's Via Sant'Andrea. The 11,448 square-foot boutique is the first to house all of the brand's products, including its leather goods, men's and women's ready-to- wear, shoes, fine jewelry, eyewear, fragrance, luggage, furniture and home collections. The company plans to open another \\"Maison,\\" on a similar scale, in New York. In 2015, Bottega Veneta announced the opening of a first dedicated home boutique in Italy, Via Borgospesso in Milan. Located within the 18th-century Palazzo Gallarati Scotti, the 2207 square-foot ground floor boutique has been designed by Bottega Veneta Creative Director Tomas Maier to present its furniture, lighting, tabletop, and home decoration. Bottega Veneta opened their second Maison in Beverly Hills in May 2016. In South America includes a Flagship boutique at Centro Andino in Bogotá, Colombia.

During his club football career, he played in England for Ipswich Town, Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Manchester City, winning the Football League Cup at Villa in 1994. He also played for many teams abroad; in Spain for Real Sociedad, in France for Metz, in Turkey for Fenerbahçe, in Saudi Arabia for Al-Ittihad, and in South Korea for Daejeon Citizen and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. Atkinson died on 15 August 2016, after a taser was deployed on him by West Mercia Police near his father's house in Trench, Telford, where he had grown up.Report by Lisa O'Brien, published following his funeral. Club career =Early career= Atkinson first came to prominence at Ipswich Town as a teenager, impressing seasoned experts with his speed and daring, which included a hat-trick against a Middlesbrough side containing Gary Pallister and future Ipswich captain Tony Mowbray at the heart of their defence, in the 1987–88 season. In 1989, manager Ron Atkinson (no relation) brought him to Sheffield Wednesday for £450,000 where he formed a fine front partnership with David Hirst for a single season. He was an ever- present in the league for Sheffield Wednesday in his only season there, scoring 10 goals but being unable to prevent them from being relegated. After relegation he was sold to Real Sociedad for £1.7 million. The San Sebastián- based team had recently broken a tradition of only signing local players in order to bring fellow British players John Aldridge and Kevin Richardson to the club, making Atkinson their third foreigner and also the first black player in Real Sociedad's history. He was nicknamed El txipiron (The squid) by Sociedad fans during the 1990–91 season. His team did not have a good year, although Atkinson made a good contribution over the season, scoring 12 goals in La Liga. Atkinson was racially abused by opposition fans during his time in Spain. =Aston Villa= Atkinson joined Aston Villa for £1.6 million in July 1991, and became one half of another impressive partnership alongside Dean Saunders, when Saunders arrived from Liverpool a year after Atkinson arrived there from Real Sociedad. The partnership was broken up in 1995 when both players were sold to Turkish clubs – Saunders to Galatasaray and Atkinson to Fenerbahçe for £1.7 million. Atkinson is probably most often remembered for his magnificent solo goal against Wimbledon in a 3–2 away win on 3 October 1992, which won Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1992–93 season, the first season of the new FA Premier League, when Villa finished runners-up. Starting deep in the Aston Villa half of the pitch with a one- touch trap from a lofted ball that immediately took him away from a defending player, Atkinson then skipped past two more Wimbledon players and, pausing briefly as he reached the edge of the opposition penalty area, produced a delicately arched chip-shot that floated over the rushing goalkeeper. Atkinson also had the distinction of scoring Villa's first Premier League goal, when he scored their late equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Ipswich on the opening day of the season. Atkinson is remembered by Aston Villa fans for his goal in the 1994 League Cup final win against Manchester United, and that he scored twice in the semi finals against Tranmere Rovers (once in the first leg and once in the second). =Later career= Atkinson missed Villa's departure for a 1994 pre- season tour of South Africa because of what was described as \\"personal problems.\\" When Ron Atkinson left and was replaced as manager by Brian Little, he fell out of favour. In July 1995, Atkinson arrived in Istanbul to agree a deal with Fenerbahçe S.K..https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2690338-the- life-and-times-of-dalian-atkinson-a-great-talent-unfulfilled Atkinson failed to settle in Turkey and had loan spells with Metz and Manchester City. Atkinson left the club in 1997 and ended his career with stints in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, finally retiring as a player in 2001. He returned to Telford where he ultimately lived at Little Dawley. In his last years his health suffered with heart and kidney problems. International career Atkinson represented the England B side in a friendly 4–1 loss against Republic of Ireland B on 27 March 1990. He scored England's only goal in the game. Death Atkinson died on 15 August 2016 after being tasered by police near his father's house in Trench, Telford.Special Report by Jordan Reynolds and Mark Andrews. Police had responded to a call as Atkinson threatened to kill his father, Ernest. Atkinson's older brother Kenroy said \\"My brother had lost it.

Glover; Wesley Heights was further developed by the brothers William C. and Allison N. Miller during the 1920s. Modern-day Wesley Heights is bordered by Massachusetts Avenue (on the east), Nebraska Avenue (on the north), Battery-Kemble Park (on the west) and Glover Parkway (on the south). Foxhall Road and New Mexico Avenue are the main roadway passing through Wesley Heights. To protect the character of the original historic housing design of Wesley Heights, the Wesley Heights Zoning Overlay was developed and approved by District of Columbia Zoning Commission on July 13, 1992, at the urging of the Wesley Heights Historical Society. Current homeowners and new housing development within the Wesley Heights overlay must meet specific building codes. The Wesley overlay covers areas west of New Mexico Avenue (on the East), Nebraska Avenue (on the North), Battery-Kemble Park (on the West) and Glover Parkway (on the South). The overlay restriction does not cover development on housing located on the former Charles C. Glover country estate. Modern day Wesley Heights is located in Ward 3 Advisory Neighborhood Commission under 3D01. History Wesley Heights advert in the Washington Post in 1891 Wesley Heights' current boundaries in the District of Columbia Ward 3 The area which became Wesley Heights was part of a tract of land owned by John Threlkeld (a resident of Georgetown). The tract of land was called Alliance. In 1890, a group of investors fronted by John Waggaman (a real estate broker) and bankrolled by Charles. C. Glover bought all the land between Chain Bridge Road to the east, Newark Street to the North, 43rd Street (which then ran parallel to 44th street past Newark Street), and Fulton Street to the south. Tunlaw Street (Now New Mexico Street) ran perpendicular between 44th street and 43rd street. The group named the new development Wesley Heights to appeal to Methodist buyers https://auislandora.wrlc.org/islandora/object/thesesdissertations:2657/datastream/PDF/view. John Waggaman and Charles C. Glover played instrumental roles in the selection and purchase of the site of the soon to be Methodist-affiliated American University just north of Newark Street.http://wdchumanities.org/docs/08grants/TenleytownNRHP001.pdf The newly named Wesley Height development was divided into plots and some of the plots were sold to prospective home buyers and investors. In 1892, Charles C. Glover acquired all the Wesley Heights plots (block 29, 22 and 21) between New Mexico Street and the then 43rd street, and built his country mansion named Westover. By 1908, John Waggaman estate had filed for bankruptcy and Charles Glover was summoned to court to give testimony; the vast majority of Wesley Heights had been mortgaged to the hilt and there was suspicion that John Waggaman and Charles Glover had benefited from nefarious activities pertaining to the financing and acquisition of Wesley Heights and other large land developments in Washington, D.C. For years after the bankruptcy, Wesley Heights was neglected, and was mostly occupied by Charles Glover grand estate, Westover, and a few homes that were developed by John Waggaman. In 1897, led by Charles Glover, the owners of Wesley Heights offered to sell a large section of Wesley Height (land adjunct to Nebraska Avenue and Loughboro Road) to American University.https://auislandora.wrlc.org/islandora/object/auislandora%3A8450/.../PDF/download The university declined the offer. Charles Glover offer letter to sell portion of Wesley Heights land to American University During the 1920s, a revitalization effort was initiated by real estate developers W.C. and A.N. Miller with the purchasing of plots (80 acres) in Wesley Heights. W.C. and A.N. Miller began constructing homes in Wesley Heights, and also in the neighboring communities of Spring Valley and American University Park. W.C. and A.N. Miller planned development in Wesley Heights was one of the first master-planned communities in the United States and featured such services as a shuttle to the Wisconsin Avenue streetcar and a community club house. Wesley Heights' Geography before the 1920 revitalization Not much is known about the geography of Wesley Heights before W.C. and A.N. Miller began building houses on Wesley Heights. Nevertheless, in 1894 Kate Field, the renown American journalist, notes in her published periodical journal (Kate Field's Washington), a vivid description of Wesley Heights from a viewpoint on Charles Glover's estate. According to Kate Field: \\"Whoever stands on the broad piazza of Mr. and Mrs. C.C Glover's country home, \\"Westover\\", on Wesley Heights, has a view that vividly recalls the neighborhood of Richmond, England. Never was the scene more attractive than one day last week when Mr. Glover received several hundred friends. Four hundred feet above sea level, \\"Westover\\" commands the Blue Ridge on one side and the winding Potomac on the other. The tip of the monument is visible from the ground, while the Capitol may be seen from the top of the house. Truly a beautiful situation with a perennial breeze untainted by malaria.

It contains a number of sarcastic plot devices that ridicule high school English classes, standardized testing, satanic panic and talk-show analysts. The book is a classic example of an unreliable narrator. Consistent with Handler's farcical treatment of high school English, he includes vocabulary words and study questions at the end of some of Culp's diary entries. Plot Flannery \\"Flan\\" Culp is a senior at Roewer High School in San Francisco. Over the course of the year, Flan records the events of her life in a diary - which, with some heavy editing by Flannery herself years after the fact, becomes the narrative. She and her seven close friends refer to themselves as \\"The Basic Eight\\". They are an exclusive clique, hosting the Grand Opera Breakfast Club, and regular dinner and garden parties. The story chronicles Flannery and her friends as they cope with the stresses of their final year of high school and Flannery's complicated love life. The story reaches a dark conclusion in which lives of the members of the Basic Eight are turned upside down by revealed secrets, horrifying self-discoveries, and murder. Characters The Basic Eight consists of: *Flannery Culp, the protagonist. *Kate Gordon, the Queen Bee. *Lily Chandly, a classical musician. *Douglas Wilde, Flan's ex-boyfriend. *V__, whose rich parents have had her name expunged from the story. *Jennifer Rose Milton, a name so beautiful that Flan must always write it out in full. *Gabriel Gallon, the kindest boy in the world. *Natasha Hyatt, Flan's exuberant and beautiful best friend. Additional characters include: * Adam State, the object of Flannery's affections. * Ron Piper, the high school drama club director. * Steve Nero, the most popular boy in school.  Connections  In Handler's third novel, Adverbs, Kate is mentioned as the girlfriend of a minor character, Garth, in the chapter \\"Soundly\\". In The Basic Eight, Kate frequently gives relationship advice from her two-week relationship with Garth, much to Flannery's annoyance. In the A Series Of Unfortunate Events video game for the Game Boy Advance, an item needed in several quests is \\"The Basic Nine by Danny Handy\\".  Publication history  The Basic Eight was the first novel published by author Daniel Handler. Handler has stated in several interviews that it was very difficult for him to get the novel published- it was rejected 37 times before publication by Thomas Dunne Books. Handler's pen name, Lemony Snicket, was created while he was researching for The Basic Eight and needed a fake name to write down while signing up for right-wing organizations' mailing lists.  Reception  The New Yorker featured the novel in its First Novels section, writing, \\"This shrewdly funny novel is the diary of Flannery Culp, the alleged ringleader of eight high-school seniors who are accused of ritualistic Satanic murder, and instantly become the patients of countless armchair therapists and favorites with the What's Wrong with Our Youth crowd. Handler is a charming writer with a lovely mastery of voice, but the book is weakened by his attempt to turn a clever idea into social satire\\".

Different interpretations of Ukemochi often refer to them as both male and female. When shown in other forms, Ukemochi takes the shape of a fox. Ōgetsu-hime is the wife of Hayamato (羽山戸神, Hayamato-no-kami), who is the son of Toshigami through his wife Amechikarumizu-hime (天知迦流美豆比売) in the Kojiki. In some legends, Ukemochi is also the wife of Inari and in others, she is Inari. When Ukemochi (Ōgetsu-hime) was visited by Tsukuyomi, she prepared a feast by facing the ocean and spitting out a fish, then she faced the forest and bountiful game spewed out of her mouth, finally turning to a rice paddy, she coughed up a bowl of rice. In the Kojiki, it is stated that she pulled various foods from within her nose, rectum, and mouth to prepare a feast. Tsukuyomi was so disgusted he killed her. Her dead body also produced food: millet, rice seeds, wheat, and beans sprang forth. Out of her eyebrows came silkworms. While different sources mention similar items that came from Ukemochi's body, from which part of her body these items came from is less agreed upon. In some narratives of Ukemochi, after her death Tsukuyomi finds that the food that came from her body could not be destroyed. He takes the grains and animals that came from Ukemochi's body and gives them new life. This new life was put under Inari's jurisdiction. It is believed that Ukemochi's death explained why the sun and the moon are not seen together as the sun goddess, Amaterasu, who heard of Ukemochi's passing, never wanted to meet her killer, the moon god, Tsukuyomi, again.

Chivo was launched 14 January 1945 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. Edith Lindholm Baldwin, wife of Raymond E. Baldwin, the governor of Connecticut; and commissioned 28 April 1945, Lieutenant Commander William R. Crutcher, USNR, in command.  1945–1950  Chivo departed New London 7 June 1945 for Key West where she trained and exercised briefly at the sound school and experimental torpedo range, before sailing on to Pearl Harbor in company with and . While the submarine was preparing for her first war patrol, hostilities ended; Chivo then remained at Pearl Harbor, operating locally with other ships of the Pacific Fleet. Assigned to Submarine Squadron Seven (SubRon 7), she returned to the States in October, basing out of San Diego, California for local operations which continued until January 1946, when Chivo sailed for a short tour of duty operating out of Subic Bay in the Philippines. Returning to San Diego in May, the submarine exercised along the west coast for the next 15 months, a period culminating in an overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Growing tensions in Asia, provoked in part by French conflict with the Vietminh in Indochina and disagreements over the future of Korea, encouraged the Navy to conduct more realistic training for submariners. As part of this general approach, Chivo began a three-month simulated war patrol in August 1947 which took her to Suva, Fiji Islands; Guam; and Japan; before she arrived back at San Diego in November. West coast duty continued for her until mid-1949 when she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at her new home port of Naval Station Key West and Submarine Squadron Four (SubRon 4) on 4 July 1949. During her transit there the boat's movement reports describe one of the hazards of sailing in the warm waters in the West Indies when Chivo \\"struck unidentified submerged object, possibly turtle.\\" The submarine provided training and services for Atlantic Fleet ships in intertype exercises until 30 October 1950 when she arrived at New London to begin an extensive Greater Underwater Propulsion Program (GUPPY 1-A) overhaul and modernization. The modifications included streamlining the hull and superstructure, adding a snorkel to allow diesel engine operation while at periscope depth and increasing overall battery power.  1951–1960  With increased power and a new streamlined shape, Chivo returned to duty with the Atlantic Fleet in July 1951, resuming anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training operations with surface ships as well as maintaining proficiency in anti-shipping and mine warfare. These drills and exercises took place mainly off Key West and Guantanamo Bay. This regular training continued until 19 April 1952 when Chivo sailed for a short cruise with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, visiting Augusta, Sicily; Cannes and Marseille, France; and Naples, Italy; before returning home via the Azores in June. Chivo, after modernization, 1953. Assigned to Submarine Squadron Twelve (SubRon 12) upon her return to Key West, the submarine resumed her familiar training routine with the Fleet Sonar School interspersed with port visits to Havana, Cuba; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Port- au-Prince, Haiti. Aside from a three-month overhaul at Philadelphia between January and May 1953, Chivo remained in the West Indies until October when the submarine transited the Panama Canal for a month of operations off the Pacific coast of Colombia. This training period continued until May 1954 when the boat began a four-month regular overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard. She again returned to Fleet Sonar School duty in September, with such employment put on hold in March 1955 for a ten-week battery renewal restricted availability. In a change to her normal schedule, the submarine visited Gulfport, Mississippi, in March 1956 and New York City in August of that same year. After another visit to Gulfport in January 1957 to train reservists, and Santiago de Cuba in February, Chivo commenced an overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard in March. Returning to normal duty out of Key West in September, the boat remained there save for the occasional port visit to Gulf Ports until transferred to Charleston and Submarine Squadron Four in July 1959, a shift completed after a short cruise north to Boston, and Quebec City, Canada the previous month. Chivo resumed her familiar ASW services out of Charleston shortly thereafter, a duty she continued in January 1960 with ASW services to patrol aircraft off Bermuda. She followed that with another overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard between March and September, with repairs and modifications that included a new sonar system. On 4 October 1960 Chivo began her first out-of-area cruise in eight years, though she first sailed south to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, for a two-week amphibious exercise with the 2d Reconnaissance Company, Fleet Marine Force. The submarine then sailed to South Africa, via Trinidad, British West Indies, for Operation CAPEX-60, a joint ASW exercise with British, French, Portuguese and South African ships and aircraft. While en route, the boat held the traditional crossing-the-line ceremonies at the equator. As put by the Navy Times, \\"Although greatly outnumbered, the fifteen 'shellbacks' kept complete control as they initiated the 'polywogs' into the Ancient Order of the Deep.\\" The exercise, which included port visits to Simonstown, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, lasted through November and Chivo did not return home to Charleston, via San Juan, Puerto Rico, until 21 December.  1961–1971  Over the next few years, Chivo continued to specialize in her role as an \\"opposition force\\" (i.e. Soviet) submarine during ASW training exercises. These included pretending to launch a ballistic missile at the United States, disrupting \\"blue force\\" amphibious convoys or attempting submerged transits against reconnaissance aircraft patrols. In the latter case during Operation DeltEx XV in October 1962, Chivo managed to stay undetected during a three-day submerged transit opposed by aircraft from Norfolk and Bermuda. In addition to conducting similar exercises in 1963, the submarine also received a plastic fairwater sail to help with underwater speed during a regular overhaul at Charleston between February and June 1964. On 4 January 1965 the submarine got underway for her second Mediterranean deployment, stopping at Lisbon, Portugal; and Rota, Spain; before beginning a series of exercises with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces off Italy and Turkey. The boat sailed for home from Athens, Greece, on 14 April and arrived, via Rota, on 2 May. Chivo spent the rest of the year conducting her usual local training operations, including a specialized mine planting exercise. A regularly scheduled five-month overhaul took place at Charleston in early 1966, followed by type training and the usual ASW services to various Atlantic Fleet units. During this period Chivo also participated in the final weapons range acceptance tests for the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahama Islands. Local operations continued into 1967, with Chivo servicing warships and submarines out of Guantanamo Bay and conducting prospective commanding officer training in nearby operating areas. This routine was only broken in January 1968 when the submarine participated in destroyer-submarine Exercise Springboard I, a six-week exercise that allowed Chivo to conduct forty-eight torpedo firings at surface and sub-surface targets, greatly improving the skill of the fire control team. Following upkeep alongside submarine tender , the submarine then sailed north on 26 May to assist in Search and Rescue operations for , with Chivo assisting in tracing the intended track of the wrecked submarine. During November, Chivo provided services for the AUTEC range at Bermuda before ending the year at Charleston. After another overhaul between January and August 1969, the submarine conducted refresher and type training in preparation for Exercise Springboard II in January 1970. After a port visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in mid-January, the boat sailed north to Portsmouth, Virginia, for repairs. She then conducted two months of training services out of Guantanamo Bay before returning to Charleston on 28 April. At this time, the Navy — needing money and qualified manpower elsewhere — reduced Chivo's manning level to 43 sailors and placed the boat in cadre or \\"non-operational\\" status. A service inspection completed on 16 February 1971 determined the boat was unfit for further service, as Chivo was \\"far below the standards of a Guppy III submarine considered the minimum required to meet the increasing demands of present and future submarine warfare requirements.\\" Although temporarily returned to active duty on 26 February 1971, the status change was in preparation for her transfer to a foreign navy that summer. There was still time for providing training and services, however, and the submarine conducted operational readiness exercises with in March; mainly conducting trailing, approach and torpedo firing exercises with the newer nuclear-powered submarine. Chivo provided the same \\"opposition force\\" training for in April and in May. These services ended when Argentine Naval personnel arrived at Charleston on 15 June to receive two weeks of underway training with Chivo's crew, focusing on diving, surfacing and snorkeling evolutions. Chivo decommissioned at Charleston Navy Yard on 1 July 1971 and was struck from the Navy List that same day.  Argentine service  Santiago del Estero, Argentine Naval Base Mar del Plata The submarine was transferred (sold) to Argentina, under terms of the Security Assistance Program on 1 July 1971. She served in the Argentine Navy (Armada de la República Argentina) as ARA Santiago del Estero (S-22) , the third submarine to be named in honor of Santiago del Estero Province.

Similarly one may define FNL, which has the same relation with NL as FNP has with NP.

Flack was born in Greenport, Long Island, New York in 1897. She was best known for The Story about Ping (1933), illustrated by Kurt Wiese, popularized by Captain Kangaroo, and for her stories of an insatiably curious Scottish terrier named Angus, who was actually her dog. Her first marriage was to artist Karl Larsson; she later married poet William Rose Benét. Her book Angus Lost was featured prominently in the movie Ask the Dust (2006), starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek, in which Farrell's character teaches Hayek's character, a Mexican, to read English using Flack's book. Marjorie Flack's grandson, Tim Barnum, and his wife, Darlene Enix-Barnum, currently sponsor an annual creative writing award at Anne Arundel Community College. The award, called The Marjorie Flack Award for Fiction, consists of a $250 prize for the best short story or children's storybook written by a current AACC student.

Marianne Weber (born Marianne Schnitger, 2 August 1870 – 12 March 1954) was a German sociologist, women's rights activist and the wife of Max Weber. Life =Childhood, 1870–1893= Marianne Schnitger was born on 2 August 1870 in Oerlinghausen to medical doctor Eduard Schnitger and his wife, Anna Weber, daughter of a prominent Oerlinghausen businessman Karl Weber.Patricia M. Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, \\"Marianne Weber (1870- 1954): A Woman-Centered Sociology,\\" The Women Founders: Sociology and Social Theory, 1830-1930 : a Text/reader, Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1998. 194. After the death of her mother in 1873, she moved to Lemgo and was raised for the next fourteen years by her grandmother and aunt. During this time, both her father and his two brothers went mad and were institutionalized.Lengermann, 194 When Marianne turned 16, Karl Weber sent her off to fashionable finishing schools in Lemgo and Hanover, from which she graduated when she was 19. After the death of her grandmother in 1889, she lived several years with her mother's sister, Alwine, in Oerlinghausen. In 1891, Marianne began to spend time with the Charlottenburg Webers, Max Jr. and his mother, Helene, in particular. She became very close to Helene, who she would refer to as being \\"unaware of her own inner beauty\\".Marianne Weber, 1997, Max Weber: a biography, New York: Wiley, 1975. 18. In 1893, she and Max Weber married in Oerlinghausen and moved into their own apartment in Berlin. =Marriage, 1893–1920= Marianne and Max Weber, 1894 During the first few years of their marriage, Max taught in Berlin, then, in 1894, at the University of Heidelberg.Lengermann and Niebrugge-Brantley. 196-7. During this time, Marianne pursued her own studies. After moving to Freiburg in 1894, she studied with a leading neo-Kantian philosopher, Heinrich Rickert. She also began to engage herself in the women's movement after hearing prominent feminist speakers at a political congress in 1895. In 1896, in Heidelberg, she co-founded a society for the circulation of feminist thought. She also worked with Max to raise the level of women students attending the university. In 1898, Max suffered a psychological collapse, possibly brought on after his father's death, which happened shortly after Max confronted him regarding abuse of Helene.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 197 Between 1898 and 1904, Max withdrew from public life, moving in and out of mental institutions, traveling compulsively and resigning from his prominent position at University of Heidelberg. During this time, their roles reversed somewhat; as Max worked toward recovery and rested at home, Marianne attended political meetings, sometimes until late at night, and published her first book in 1900: Fichtes Sozialismus und sein Verhältnis zur Marxschen Doktrin (\\"Fichte's Socialism and its Relation to Marxist Doctrine\\").Lengermann and Niebrugge-Brantley. 197. In 1904, the Webers toured America. In America, Marianne met both Jane Addams and Florence Kelley, both staunch feminists and active political reformers Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 197. Also during that year, Max re- entered the public sphere, publishing, among other things, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Marianne also continued her own scholarship, publishing in 1907 her landmark work Ehefrau und Mutter in der Rechtsentwicklung (\\"Wife and Mother in the Development of Law\\"). In 1907, Karl Weber died, and left enough money to his granddaughter Marianne for the Webers to live comfortably.Weber, ?? During this time, Marianne first established her intellectual salon. Between 1907 and the start of World War I, Marianne enjoyed a rise in her status as an intellectual and a scholar as she published \\"The Question of Divorce\\" (1909), \\"Authority and Autonomy in Marriage\\" (1912) and \\"On the Valuation of Housework\\" (1912), and \\"Women and Objective Culture\\" (1913). While the Webers presented a united front in public life, as Max defended his wife from her scholarly detractors, Max carried on an affair with Else Jaffe, a mutual friend.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 198 In 1914, World War I broke out. While Max busied himself publishing his multi- volume study of religion, lecturing, organizing military hospitals, serving as an adviser in peace negotiations and running for office in the new Weimar Republic, Marianne published many works, among which were: \\"The New Woman\\" (1914), \\"The Ideal of Marriage\\" (1914), \\"War as an Ethical Problem\\" (1916), \\"Changing Types of University Women\\" (1917), \\"The Forces Shaping Sexual Life\\" (1919) and \\"Women's Special Cultural Tasks\\" (1919).Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 198. In 1918, Marianne Weber became a member of the German Democratic Party and, shortly thereafter, the first woman elected as a delegate in the federal state parliament of Baden.Marianne Weber: Lebenserinnerungen , Johs. Storm Verlag Bremen 1948, p. 82. Also in 1919, she assumed the role of chairwoman of the Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine (League of German Women's Associations), an office she would hold until 1923. p. 382. Also in 1920, Max's sister Lili suddenly committed suicide, and Max and Marianne adopted her four children.Lengermann and Niebrugge-Brantley, 199. Shortly thereafter, Max Weber contracted pneumonia and died suddenly on 14 June 1920, leaving Marianne a widow with four children to raise. =Widowhood, 1920–1954= Following Max's unexpected death, Marianne withdrew from public and social life, funneling her physical and psychological resources into preparing ten volumes of her husband's writing for publication. In 1924, she received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Heidelberg, both for her work in editing and publishing Max's work as well as for her own scholarship. Between 1923 and 1926, Weber worked on Max Weber: Ein Lebensbild (\\"Max Weber: A Biography\\"), which was published in 1926. Also in 1926, she re- established her weekly salon, and entered into a phase of public speaking in which she spoke to audiences of up to 5,000. During this phase, she continued to raise Lili's children with the help of a close-knit circle of friends.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 199 Marianne Weber in Nazi Germany Weber's career as a feminist public speaker ended abruptly in 1935 when Hitler dissolved the League of German Women's Associations. During the time of the Nazi regime up until the Allied Occupation of Germany in 1945, she held a weekly salon. While criticisms of Nazi atrocities were sometimes subtly implied, she told interviewer Howard Becker in 1945 that \\"we restricted ourselves to philosophical, religious and aesthetic topics, making our criticism of the Nazi system between the lines, as it were. None of us were the stuff of which martyrs were made.\\" Weber did claim, however, to know people who had been involved in the July Plot. Weber continued to write during this time, however, and published Frauen und Liebe (\\"Women and Love\\") in 1935 and Erfülltes Leben (\\"The Fulfilled Life\\") in 1942. Later life On 12 March 1954, Weber died in Heidelberg, in what was then West Germany. Work =Themes= The basis of Weber's sociology was that of a woman in a patriarchal society. She wrote about the experiences of German women of her time, many of whom were entering the workforce for the very first time. This new exposure of women to the outside world led to shifting gender-based power dynamics within the household.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 203 The male-created and male-dominated institutions of law, religion, history and the economy provide a framework for the lives of women, whose autonomy suffers as a result. Weber also felt that the framework and structures of marriage can be used as a case-study for the larger society, as marriage, and the destiny of women to be married, is central to the lives of women, and could be seen across the spectrum of law, religion, history and economy.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 204 She acknowledged that while marriage could restrict the lives of women, it could also serve as a form of protection for women, serving to undermine \\"the brutal power of men by contract\\".Dickenson, 397. Weber's work, especially the 1907 Wife and Mother in the Development of Law, was devoted to the analysis of the institution of marriage. Her conclusion was that marriage is \\"a complex and ongoing negotiation over power and intimacy, in which money, women's work, and sexuality are key issues\\". Another theme in her work was that women's work could be used to \\"map and explain the construction and reproduction of the social person and the social world\\".Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 207 Human work creates cultural products ranging from small, daily values such as cleanliness and honesty to larger, more abstract phenomena like philosophy and language. Between the two extremes lies a vast, unexplored middle territory called \\"the middle ground of immediate daily life\\", in which women, being the caretakers, child-rearers, and everyday economic actors of the family, have a large part. This middle ground is where the self is created, for the most part, Weber argued, and that self then affects other people in its daily actions in the world. She also felt that the continual struggle between the spiritual and the animal is what makes people human and that rather than being a crisis to be resolved, the conflict between the natural and the moral forms the basis of human dignity. This \\"millennial struggle of human beings for the subordination of instinctual life under the dominion of morally free human will\\" is a cultural product, for the production of which women are largely responsible.Dickenson, 401. Finally, Weber also felt that differences such as class, education, age, and base ideologies, had an enormous effect on the day to day existences of women. She saw that there are profound differences not just between rural and urban women, but also among different types of rural women and different types of urban women.Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge-Brantley, 210 Urban women, of whom Weber was one, were distinguished not just by their husbands' occupations but also by their own. Within the class of working women, women's occupations (traditional women's work versus the elite: academics, artists, writers, etc) have an everyday effect upon patterns of daily life and lead to differences in needs, lifestyle and overall ideologies. =Georg Simmel and Marianne Weber= There has been discussion of Max Weber's scholarly connection to Georg Simmel, particularly in terms of their influence on the Frankfurt School, but Marianne Weber too was a colleague of Simmel.\\"Elective affinities: Georg Simmel and Marianne Weber on gender and modernity.\\" Theresa Wobbe. Engendering the Social: Feminist Encounters with Sociological Theory. eds. Barbara L. Marshall and Anne Witz. Maidenhead, England: Open University Press, 2004. pp 54-68. In addition to a more than 20 year friendship, in which Max and Simmel conversed and wrote letters often, Weber wrote a critical response to Simmel's 1911 essay \\"The Relative and the Absolute in the Problem of the Sexes\\", in which she criticized his concept of \\"gender relations\\".Wobbe, 54. Both sociologists dealt with the \\"woman question\\" and, more broadly, \\"the interrelation between gendered modes of individuation, social differentiation and gender difference\\".Wobbe, 55. =Publications= *“Occupation and Marriage” (1906) *“Wife and Mother in the Development of Law” (1907) *“Authority and Autonomy” (1912) *“On The Valuation of Housework” (1912)Lengermann, P.

It was released for the Sega consoles, Sega Genesis and Sega Master System, and Sega's handheld, Sega Game Gear. Developed internally by Tiertex Design Studios, the game was sponsored by Coca-Cola and the game featured both the company logo on a zeppelin above the scoreboard, as well as the company jingle. The game uses button mashing as the main part of gameplay, but in three events it isn't used (archery, diving) or is slow-paced (swimming). Each computer athlete has a fictional name and nationality (choosing from UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United States, Japan and the Unified Team, everyone with its own anthem snippet) and actual strengths and weaknesses: J. Balen, for instance, is a frequent 100 m and 110 m hurdles record breaker but only an average hammer thrower. Also, each computer-controlled player seems better in a particular event depending on his country: Germans usually take the top spots in archery, Italians on swimming, Russians on pole vault, Americans on sprinting and so on. Events *100 m *Hammer throw *Archery *110 m hurdles *Pole vault *200 m freestyle swimming *3 m springboard diving Competition The game allows the player to practice, play mini-Olympics (where some events can be turned off) or full Olympics. There are three difficulty levels (club, national and Olympic) with noticeable differences from each other: computer-controlled athletes are actually capable of breaking world and Olympic records at the higher levels, while achieving only mediocre results on lower levels. Scoring in the Olympic modes follow the results table by position, the gold medal giving 24 points, and then reducing one point for each competitor behind until the 12th and last receives 13 points. The game is easy for experienced players, except for the sprinting and hurdles events and the hammer, as the computer is able to break records quite easily in Olympic, and they also rely on a fair share or luck and random. Diving, unlike more recent titles where the player simply has to \\"click-a- long\\" a predefined sequence of buttons actually gives the player to control their own jumps. This means that one could indicate a jump and make one completely different, resulting in 0.0 notes. However, with practice it's perfectly possible to reach marks above 9.0 even for jumps rated 3.5. The same happens with pole vault, as an experienced player is able to clear 6.35 m easily. Playable nations There is a total of 8 playable countries in the game.

She is notable for being the last sailing ship of the Navy to serve as a flagship, and was the second ship to bear the name. Admiralty orders of 4 June 1816 directed her to be built as a facsimile of HMS Canopus (the ex-French ship Franklin, which had fought at the Battle of the Nile). Building began in May 1819, under the direction of master shipbuilder Jamsetjee Bomanjee Wadia. She was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1823, and served in several locations over the following decades. Notable events included a period as flagship of the South America Station for three years, during which she landed Royal Marines in Rio de Janeiro after a mutiny by Brazilian soldiers. She also saw action in the Mediterranean from 1838 to 1840, bombarding Beirut and blockading Alexandria. She was paid off during the Crimean War, and saw no action. From 1857 to 1861, she was the flagship of the Pacific Station, based at Valparaíso, Chile under the command of Rear admiral Robert Lambert Baynes. She spent considerable time addressing the San Juan Boundary Dispute from the Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard at the Colony of Vancouver Island after which she returned to England to be converted into a training ship; she began service as the training ship HMS Ganges in 1865 at Mylor Harbour, near Falmouth; in 1899, she was moved to Harwich. In 1905, she became part of RNTE (Royal Naval Training Establishment) Shotley, which also included the ships HMS Caroline and HMS Boscawen III. She was renamed Tenedos III in 1906, then moved to Devonport to become part of the training establishment HMS Indus; on 13 August 1910, she was renamed Indus V. In October 1922, she was renamed Impregnable III and transferred to the training establishment HMS Impregnable, also at Devonport. She was finally taken out of service in 1923, and transferred to the dockyard; in 1929, she was sold for breaking up. The following year, after over a century in service, she was finally broken up at Plymouth. The Guildford Cathedral cross Upon breaking, some of the timber was used to make souvenirs, usually having a small brass plaque with some of the ship's history attached. The panelling in the captain's cabin was purchased by Thomas Nelson, 4th Earl Nelson, who installed it in the principal top-floor room at Trafalgar Park in Wiltshire.The History of Trafalgar Park The captain's cabin in the stern was used in the construction of the Burgh Island Hotel in Devon, where it remains to this day. In 1933, timbers from the ship were also used to construct the cross that stands outside the eastern end of Guildford Cathedral in Surrey. The town of Ganges, British Columbia, on Salt Spring Island, and the adjacent waters of Ganges Harbour are named after HMS Ganges. In addition, the transom board of one of HMS Ganges ship's boats has pride of place in Centennial Park in the town of Ganges. The community of Vesuvius Bay, also on Saltspring Island, was named after , which, with Ganges, was also assigned to the Pacific Station. The ship's badge has been adopted by the Saltspring Island Sailing Club, and the badge's distinctive elephant is the key symbol in the club's burgee.

According to Mao on the other hand, Wang epitomized the intellectualism and foreign dogmatism Mao criticized in his essays \\"On Practice\\" and \\"On Contradiction\\". The competition between Wang and Mao was a reflection of the power struggle between the Soviet Union, through the vehicle of the Comintern, and the CCP to control both the direction and future of the Chinese revolution. Early life On May 23, 1904, Wang Ming was born in Jinzhai, Anhui, as Chen Shaoyu () to a poor peasant family. In 1920, he entered the Zhicheng Elementary School in Gushi County. Wang then entered the Third Agricultural School of the Anhui Province, which was founded by the revolutionary Zhu Yunshan. Zhu had a strong influence on the school's students, introducing many progressive journals and books such as New Youth and Communism ABC. In the school, Wang would encounter another strong influential figure in his life, A Ying (Qian Xinchun), his teacher. A Ying would teach Wang about Vladimir Lenin and Chen Duxiu. During his school years, Wang was also active in the political movement. He led boycotts of Japanese products and corrupt elections. After his graduation in 1924, Wang enrolled in the Wuchang Business School, where he studied for a year. There he published several articles on revolution and communism. That same year he joined the May 30 Movement, which involved strikes and protests against imperialism during the Northern Expedition in Wuchang. In the summer of 1924, Wang joined the CCP. From Moscow to Shanghai In November 1925, the CCP sent Wang to Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in Russia.Karl-Heinz Pohl, Chinese Thought in a Global Context: A Dialogue Between Chinese and Western Philosophical Approaches, BRILL, 1999 p.338 During this time, Wang mastered both the Russian language and Marxist–Leninist theory. It was also during this time that Wang encountered his first major political adversary, Ren Zhuoxuan. Ren was appointed as the secretary of the University's student CCP branch. Eventually Wang's eloquence won over Ren's authoritarian style in various debates. Consequently, in April 1926, Wang was elected as chairman of the University's CCP branch. After the election, Pavel Mif, the University's vice president, became fond of Wang. In January 1927, when Mif came to China as the head of a Soviet delegation, Wang was his interpreter. After the CCP's split with the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1927, Wang and Mif attended the CCP's 5th National Congress in Wuhan, after which Wang became Secretary for the CCP's Propaganda Department for two months. Wang was also a part-time editor of the Guidance journal where he published a few articles. After the July 15 coup in Wuhan, Wang returned to Moscow with Mif. After the purge of Karl Radek by Joseph Stalin, Mif was appointed as President of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, and then Vice Minister of the Eastern Department of Comintern. For his service and loyalty, Wang became Mif's protégé. Along with other activists such as Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu and Wang Jiaxiang, Wang Ming founded the 28 Bolsheviks group. They labeled themselves as orthodox communists. During his time in Moscow, Wang was involved in suppressing an organisation of Chinese Trotskyists that had sprung up in the university.Benton, G. (1996). China's Urban Revolutionaries: Explorations in the History of Chinese Trotskyism. Humanities Press International, p.24. In 1929, Wang, along with the rest of the 28 Bolsheviks, was sent back to China with the goal of taking over the leadership of the CCP. However, they met strong resistance within the CCP from members such as Zhang Guotao and Zhou Enlai. Not surprisingly, they were assigned insignificant positions. Meanwhile, Wang found comfort in dating a member of the 28 Bolsheviks, Meng Qingshu, who later became his wife. Wang was then transferred to the Propaganda Department of CCP, where Li Lisan was the incumbent minister. During a half year from 1929 to 1930, Wang published many articles in the party newspaper Red Flag and magazine Bolshevik, which supported the leftism embraced by Li. In 1930, when Wang attended a secret meeting in Shanghai, he was promptly arrested. But Wang was lucky enough to be ignored by the KMT secret police, who had no idea what value this young man might be to them. Wang was soon released after bribing the guard. Wang was transferred to CCP's Central Labor Union after his release. Although Wang was a leftist and abided by Communist dogma strictly in essence, his beliefs were different from those of Li. Wang was more strict about adhering to established Marxist theory and the policies of the Comintern. He quickly found a temporary alliance with old CCP members, labor activists such as He Mengxiong (), Lin Yunan (, a relative of Lin Biao) against Li. In a meeting, Wang argued with Li and offended Li. As a price for his being impulsive and immature, Wang was discharged from his position and demoted to the Jiangsu division of CCP. In August 1930, Zhou Enlai and Qu Qiubai were sent back to China by the Comintern to correct the leftism of Li, and Li was called to Moscow for repentance and lost his power. In December of the same year, Mif came to China as an envoy of the Comintern. With his mentor's strong support, Wang and his 28 Bolshevik associates entered the power center of the CCP in the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of CCP, by way of labeling both Li and old CCP members such as He and Luo Zhanglong () as dissidents. Of all the so-called 28 Bolsheviks, only Wang was an elected member of the CCP politburo. He was not a Commissioner of the Central Committee of CCP yet, this being a prerequisite for being a politburo member under the system proposed by Wang himself. With Mif staying in China for almost a year, the CCP was under his control, and Wang played an important role as his consultant. Although Xiang Zhongfa was the incumbent General Secretary, he was manipulated by Mif and Wang. While He and Luo were still acting to set up another group to divorce from this center, they suffered a deadly loss: He and more than 30 senior associates were arrested by the KMT in a secret meeting. He and 24 others were later executed. There was a rumor that it was Wang who sold them out to purge the dissidents, but it was baseless and without strong evidence. The only certainty was that Wang did benefit from this mysterious incident. Before long, with the arrest of Gu ShunZhang (), who was in charge of security for the CCP, many senior leaders such as Xiang and Yun Daiying () were arrested and executed. Wang returned to Moscow with his wife with a medical excuse. After Wang's departure, under the direction of Zhou Enlai, an acting politburo was set up in Shanghai. Zhou, Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu, Kang Sheng, Chen Yun, and Lu Futan (), Li Zhusheng () were selected to be in charge of the daily work of the CCP. Among these people, Zhang, Bo Gu and Li were members of the 28 Bolsheviks and close associates of Wang, so Wang could still keep remote control over the CCP through his associates. Furthermore, Kang and Chen met him and became his supporters in Moscow several years later. Both Lu and Li would later defect to the KMT. From Moscow to Yan'an From November 1931 to November 1937, Wang worked and lived in Moscow as Director of the CCP's delegation to the Comintern. During that period, he was elected as Executive Commissioner, member of the Presidium, and Alternate General of the Comintern. This indicated his prominence and popularity in the Comintern. 1937 Mao Zedong (left) Wang Ming (right) in Yan'an. It was also during this time, under the direction of Bo Gu, that the CCP suffered greatly at the hands of the KMT, both in the cities and the countryside. This led to a general retreat of the CCP to the distant countryside, called the Long March. In the Zunyi Conference, the 28 Bolsheviks dissolved. Key members of the group — Zhang Wentian, Wang Jiaxiang, and Yang Shangkun — defected to Mao Zedong's camp. Moreover, Mao had replaced Bo Gu as head of the military, which was unknown to Wang and Comintern. As Mao consolidated his power, he became the actual paramount leader of CCP, even though Zhang Wentian was officially appointed as General Secretary of the CCP in Zunyi Conference. In 1931, after a false flag attack, Imperial Japan invaded the three provinces of northeast China. Wang made his contribution to China by lecturing on the united front against imperialism in the 7th Congress of Comintern in 1935. In August 1935, the CCP delegation to the Comintern issued the August 1 Manifesto, which called upon the Chinese to unite against Japan. In the same month, a CCP delegation to the Comintern held meetings to discuss the united front against imperialism. In the meeting, Wang pointed out that the archenemy of China was Japan, not Chiang Kai-shek, and that it was possible for Chinese revolutionaries to set up an alliance with Chiang. After that, the delegation sent Zhang Hao (), whose real name was Lin Yuying (), also a relative of Lin Biao and a senior worker activist of CCP, back to Yan'an to announce the decision of this meeting. In the CCP politburo meeting (Wayaobu Meeting; ) in December, CCP made a decision to set up a united front against Japanese aggression, but still held out by labeling Chiang as the archenemy of the revolution, as much as Japan. In 1936 the Secretariat of the Comintern issued a telegram to the Secretariat of CCP to point out the error of listing Chiang with Japan as the archenemies of Chinese revolution, and that it was necessary to include Chiang's army in the war against Japan. With the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident in 1936, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident in 1937, a general war between China and Japan was unavoidable. Wang's blueprint for a united front against Japan was under construction, with the Red Army of the CCP transferred into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army fighting against Japan. For the further direction of United Front, Wang was sent back to Yan'an with Kang Sheng and Chen Yun after being absent from China for 6 years. After the return of Wang, Mao expressed his respect for Wang as an envoy of the Comintern and for his great influence for putting forward the concept of United Front against Japan. Possibly Mao wanted to appeal to the Comintern and Soviet Union behind Wang, from whom Mao desperately needed support both in money and weaponry. So when Wang brought forward a new list of leaders of CCP, Mao showed his humility by putting Wang in the first place. Wang demoted his former ally Zhang Wentian from the number 1 place to the number 7 place, which weakened his own camp and created new opponents by driving Zhang to Mao's group. Wang, Kang and Chen were elected into the new politburo, with Wang as Secretariat for the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CCP which was in charge of the daily operation of CCP headquarters. Chen was in charge of organization and Kang in charge of security, but oddly enough, Chen and Kang turned to Mao's camp, and as a result, Wang lost two important potential supporters. Moreover, when Wang passed by Xinjiang during his trip to China, he ordered Deng Fa, the notorious security boss for CCP, to arrest senior leaders of CCP Yu Xiusong, Huang Cao, Li Te and two others, who were his former opponents now working for the warlord Sheng Shicai under the direction of CCP. Five of them were tortured and executed in the prison of Sheng, accused of being Trotskyists. When Wang boasted about his dirty work to Zhang Guotao, Zhang, who was regarded as dissident himself, was greatly irritated, for he had known these old CCP members quite well and worried about being persecuted himself. After this incident, Zhang despised Wang and would never support him. When Wang returned to Yan'an, he was admired by most of the CCP members as a talent of Marxism for his erudition and deep insights into Marxism and Leninism. Some senior CCP leaders, including Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai, showed their respect for Wang, which reportedly made Mao jealous and irritated. Furthermore, Wang began to disagree with Mao over major issues on the United Front. Wang believed all CCP work should be carried out within the framework of the United Front; Mao insisted CCP should maintain its independence from the United Front instead. In order to enforce his policy, Wang made the mistake of leaving the position of Secretariat of the CCP in charge of the daily operations of the CCP headquarters, and went for the position of General Secretary of the Yangtze Division of CCP to handle United Front issues with the KMT in Wuhan, which meant Wang had left the power base in Yan'an, with Mao now able to use all means to strengthen his power grip without any interference. Decline In its battle against Imperial Japan, the KMT suffered great losses due to internal corruption, incompetence in military command, outdated military supplies and logistics, and the general strength of the Japanese military. As a strong advocate of the United Front, Wang was damaged as well by the KMT's failure in the battlefield as the KMT forces bore the brunt of the fighting; under Mao's urging the Communists rarely engaged the Japanese army in significant battles.Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, pp.212-3 After the KMT lost the battles of Xuzhou and Wuhan, in 1938, Wang suffered a heavy blow as the Yangtze Division was abolished and he himself was dismissed back to Yanan. Yanan was divided into the Southern China and Central Plain Divisions, led by Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi respectively; this was part of Mao's plot to break up the alliance of Wang and Zhou, and to promote his associate Liu. Wang was called back to Yanan to await his fate. Wang was reassigned to several insignificant ceremonial jobs. Moreover, Mao deprived Wang of authority by use of propaganda, preventing Wang from publishing his opinions and articles. With the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, Wang lost all hope for saving his political life. In 1942 Mao launched the Yan'an Rectification Movement against dogmatism and empiricism. Wang became Mao's main target as representative of dogmatism and Zhou as representative of empiricism. Although Wang experienced great humiliation, he was still fortunate to escape from tortures similar to those inflicted by Kang Sheng's secret police on other CCP members. Nonetheless, in his later book 50 Years of the CCP, and in Yanan Diary, written by a reporter from the Soviet Union, Wang accused Mao of plotting to murder him by poison. Although there are still disagreements over this accusation, Wang's health was certainly greatly damaged under this stress. In the later stages of the Rectification Campaign, Wang was forced to make a confession and apology in a public meeting. It was only after Mao received a telegram from Georgi Dimitrov that he stopped the persecution. As a show of leniency and a sign of appeasement to Dimitrov (and the Soviet Union standing behind him), Mao placed Wang on the CCP's Central Committee in the 7th National Congress. Eventually, as Wang's credibility and influence waned, Moscow's leaders began to acknowledge Mao's leadership. During the period of the Chinese Civil War, Wang was appointed as director of policy research of the CCP and responsible for some insignificant legislative work. From Beijing to Moscow It was only after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, that Wang reappeared from the shadows on to the political stage. He was elected as Director of the Central Legal Committee of the CCP and the Central People's Government. Before he was elected as Commissioner of Central Committee of CCP in the 8th National Congress of CPC in 1956, Wang went to Moscow for medical treatment and would never return. Wang wrote many articles denouncing the CCP during the conflict between the CCP and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. His memoirs did provide some useful information about CCP history. Above all, Wang was lucky to escape the persecution of the Cultural Revolution, and lived in peace until his death in 1974 in Moscow.

Formerly a player, he was a defender from 1991 until 1996. Having started his career with non-league Moor Green, he moved to FA Premier League side Coventry City in August 1992. Having made over 50 appearances for the Sky Blues, he suffered a broken leg during a match with Manchester United in 1996 which ended his career. His injury is often considered as the most horrific in the history of the Premier League to date. He moved into management following his retirement with Solihull Borough in 2001, and later took charge of Evesham United. He came out of retirement in 2008 as defensive cover for Highgate United. Club career Busst played as a defender, and started his career at non-league side Moor Green in Birmingham, before moving to FA Premier League side Coventry City in August 1992. He made his professional debut in an FA Cup match against Norwich City on 13 January 1993, and his Premier League debut three days later against the same side. Busst made ten league appearances in his first professional season, and went on to make 50 league appearances in total for the club, scoring 4 goals. =Injury= His professional playing career came to an end on 8 April 1996, whilst playing for Coventry against Manchester United. Two minutes into the match, having ventured forward after his team won a corner, Busst collided with United players Denis Irwin and Brian McClair, resulting in extensive compound fractures to both the tibia and fibula of his right leg. The match had to be delayed for nine minutes, due to Busst needing to be removed from the field on a stretcher, and blood was cleaned off the grass with water and sand. Manchester United's goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel vomited on the pitch upon seeing the injury. It was rumoured that Schmeichel had counselling for the effect of seeing the injury, but he said that this was not so. The injury is often cited as one of the worst in the history of football. The subsequent injuries suffered by Eduardo da Silva, Luc Nilis and Preston Burpo have been compared to Busst's injury by many observers, though Busst's is generally considered as by far the worst. Busst's injuries were so bad that at one point he ran the risk of having his leg amputated. While in hospital, Busst contracted MRSA, which caused further damage to the tissue and muscle in the injured part of his leg. Despite having 22 operations, Busst remained a member of the official Coventry squad for a further seven months, but never played professionally again, and he retired from the game on 6 November 1996 on medical advice, as his doctors had warned him that he would never regain full fitness to play professional football. It was not the break itself that ended his career, but the following infections. Just weeks before his retirement, Busst had been hoping to return to training the following spring and be ready for first team action by the start of the 1997–98 season. His testimonial match, played on 16 May 1997 against Manchester United, was a sell-out. England internationals Paul Gascoigne and Les Ferdinand guested for Coventry in the game, which was also notable for being the last game that United captain Eric Cantona played before he announced his retirement as a player two days later. Coaching career Since his retirement, he has worked for Coventry's backroom staff, working for their Football in the Community programme, of which he became director. A year after the testimonial match, Schmeichel bumped into Busst at Old Trafford and they had a long chat; Busst said that he was happy, working with kids in Coventry. Busst also trained as a coach, earning UEFA coaching badges. Busst went on to manage the non-league sides Solihull Borough (from 2000 until 2003) and Evesham United (from 2003 to 2006.) He briefly acted as defensive cover in 2008 for Midland Combination Premier Division side Highgate United, where his brother Paul was the club's assistant manager. Notes A. : Some sources, such as 11v11, and Soccerbase, give his transfer date as being January 1992, not August, which would mean he joined Coventry whilst they were still in the Football League First Division.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active parish church in the Archdiocese of Liverpool and the Pastoral Area of Liverpool North. It is staffed by the Society of Jesus. History South side of the church The Jesuits (members of the Society of Jesus) who staff St Francis Xavier's church have had a presence in Liverpool since the late sixteenth century. In 1840 the laymen who formed the Society of St Francis Xavier decided at a meeting in the Rose and Crown pub, Cheapside, that, as the number of Roman Catholics in Liverpool was growing rapidly, a new church was needed. The foundation stone was laid in 1842 and Joseph John Scoles was appointed as architect. Scoles went on to design the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street in London, St Ignatius Church in Preston, and was the father of Ignatius Scoles, SJ, who designed St Wilfrid's Church also in Preston. The church opened on 4 December 1848. The spire was added in 1883. The church had been designed to hold 1,000 people but this proved to be insufficient for the congregation and in 1888 an additional chapel, the Sodality Chapel designed by Edmund Kirby, was opened. In 1898 the wall dividing the Sodality Chapel from the main part of the church was demolished. The church contains outstanding examples of Victorian statuary and many fittings, including work by Conrad Dressler. It has a collection of Victorian and early 20th century vestments, which are complemented by the addition of modern banners and vestments designed by Sr Anthony, SND, and made by David Pegler of the Metropolitan Cathedral´s embroidery studios. In 2007 a shrine to St Mary del Quay – named after the first (1207) chapel in Liverpool – was unveiled at the rear of the Lady Chapel to commemorate the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool´s charter by King John. By the time of the Second World War, St Francis Xavier's was the largest Roman Catholic parish in England, containing over 13,000 Catholics. During the war the church was damaged, particularly the roof, and most of the windows were blown out. From the 1960s the Church went into decline, mainly due to the demolition of housing in the parish and the relocation of the majority of the parishioners to other parts of the city. At that time several high-rise blocks of flats were erected in the neighbourhood, but soon vandalised and ultimately demolished. For many years the area around the church was left empty and neglected. Slowly low density housing was built in Everton, mainly occupied by non-church attenders. In 1981 plans were afoot to demolish the nave,\\"Archbishop may be taken to court over church plan\\", The Times, 7 September 1981 however it was saved following a popular, national campaign. The archdiocese only agreed to support the maintenance of the Sodality chapel, the nave being looked after by the parish. Subsequently, the archdiocese erected a glass screen between the Sodality Chapel and the nave – renovating the chapel, though doing nothing to the nave – which slowly deteriorated. With a change of Jesuit staff a new energy amongst the remaining and former parishioners ensured that by 1997, the 150th anniversary of the opening of the church would be celebrated. A flower festival, celebratory dinner for 600 people in St George's Hall, and an anniversary mass – with the church full to overflowing – helped to overcome the period of decline. In 2001 the parish was combined with the parishes of St Joseph and St Mary of the Angels and the Sodality Chapel was renamed The Chapel of St Mary of the Angels and St Joseph. The former schools (Infants, Junior, Senior, and Jesuit College) which had been left derelict from the early 1980s were taken over by Hope University in the late 1990s. They now form their Everton Campus, accommodating their arts and drama departments. Alumni of the SFX schools include: John Gregson, Charlie Chaplin, Bishops Vincent Malone and Paul Gallagher, and the playwright Jimmy McGovern. Archbishop Thomas Roberts SJ, a local man, was consecrated archbishop of Bombay in SFX. Jesuit poet Fr Gerard Manley Hopkins, ministered at the parish for two years and is commemorated by a plaque near to the Langsdale St entrance. Architecture View from Angel Field Renaissance Garden =Exterior= The church is built in stone with Welsh slate roofs. Its plan consists of an eight-bay nave with north and south aisles under separate gabled roofs, and a short one-bay chancel with chapels to the north and south. To the southwest is a tower with a spire and to the southeast is the Sodality Chapel. This chapel is polygonal in plan with apse at the west and an ambulatory at the east end. In 2000 the roof was replaced and since then the building was rewired and a new heating system installed. Heritage Lottery grants paid for the exterior stonework being renovated and 'The Friends of SFX' association paid for several small-scale improvements, including the renovation of a stained glass window of St Ignatius which was blown out during the blitz and discovered in a box in the church attic. =Interior= The high altar and reredos are in white Caen limestone and include arcades and pinnacles; they were designed by S. J. Nicholl. In the side chapels – dedicated to the Sacred Heart and to Our Lady of the Rosary – are similar altars and reredoses. The side wall of Sacred Heart chapel also contains a fine, life-size carving of Christus Consolator – a copy of the famous painting by Ari Schaffer. The pulpit is made of Caen stone and an elaborate font is situated at the west end of the nave below the organ loft. Stained glass windows in the church are by Hardman and Powell; those behind the high altar and on the altars either side were blown out by the explosion of a nearby incendiary bomb during the Second World War and replaced in 1945. The window in the organ loft is dated 1935 and the windows above the pieta statue (the Window of the Hidden Saints) and under the organ loft are by Linda Walton, dated 1997 and 2000 respectively. There are also two 1950s Hardma's studios windows of St Nicholas and St George near the Langsdale Street entrance. The stained glass in the Sodality Chapel was designed by Edmund Kirby and made by Burlison and Grylls. There is a ring of eight bells cast in 1920 by John Taylor & Co., which were re-hung in 2002-03\\\\. The four-manual organ was built in 1849 by Gray & Davison and rebuilt and enlarged in 1907 by William Hill & Son.

Services are at 10:15 on Sundays and at midday on weekdays. The bells are maintained and rung regularly by the Liverpool Universities Society of Change Ringers. To celebrate Liverpool being the European Capital of Culture during 2008, an exhibition was held in the church entitled Held in Trust: 2008 Years of Sacred Culture. This consisted of artefacts from Stonyhurst College, embroideries and church plate from the church's own collection, and vestments from the chapel in the Portuguese Embassy in London. Items on display included a book of homilies of Pope Gregory from 1170, Thomas More's hat, Katherine of Aragon's chasuble, and Cardinal Wolsey's Book of Hours. In 2010 the former community chapel above the sacristies was renovated to provide a presbytery for the Jesuits who serve the parish.

He was literate in Czech, German and Latin. Not much is known about him; historians presume that he probably studied at universities in Prague, Bologna and Padua. In 1383, he became a solicitor in Žatec (Saaz) and in 1386 a rector of the town's Latin school. He lived in Prague from 1411. He spent almost all of his life in the Kingdom of Bohemia, during the reign of kings Charles and Wenceslaus. Johannes von Tepl is best known for his early humanist poem Der Ackermann aus Böhmen (Ploughman of Bohemia), sometimes also called Der Ackermann und der Tod (Ploughman and Death), written around 1401 and first printed in 1460. It is a dialogue of Death and the ploughman, who accuses Death because his wife Margaretha recently died. Central themes of the book are their opposing views on life, mankind, and morality. (In the history of Bohemia, the ploughman is an important symbol of Bohemian kings--Přemysl, the legendary founder of the Přemyslid dynasty, was originally a ploughman.)

Atchley uses temporary water fountains as sound-sources and uses analogue electronic instruments and laptops to create his works. Other important factors in his art include sculptures, and environmental and metaphorical elements. Atchley's music and live performances have been featured at various venues and festivals including The Kitchen, Bang on a Can, and the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival. In September 1982, Atchley took part in a joint concert called the Rota-League Concert when the League of Automated Music Composers joined forces with an electronic-music band called The Rotary Club. Atchley worked with choreographer Roseanne Spradlin in 2003 to create Rearrangement (or a Spell for Mortals) as a duet for Walter Dundervill and Athena Malloy. According to the New York Times, the piece \\"sounds like running water\\" and \\"the dancers explore issues of mortality in an appropriately enigmatic setting\\". In winter 2006-2007 he composed a set of works for strings. The pieces, collectively titled 7 stillnesses, exploit a range of avant-garde harmonic progressions with emphasis on passages in which a chord is held long enough that its value within the harmonic progression disappears. The title refers not to a determinable number of \\"stillnesses\\"; more to the mythic use of number to refer to subjective experiences of stillness and quietude. The writing extends techniques that Atchley developed in his electronic work. In this composition the combined harmonics of an ensemble of string instruments create pared down, absorbing, tonal sound-planes. In 2009, Atchley performed concert versions of turtle. The primary sound of this work is generated by six sine wave tones in the frequency range from 261.63 Hz and 440.00 Hz. Attending video landscapes are generated by defining and displaying sets of points within a single, germinal image. Atchley has released several CDs of solo, electro-acoustic-noise works including fountains (published by Auscultare Research). He has also worked closely with other artists to create joint projects such as Sealed Cantus with John Bischoff (released on Bischoff's 23Five CD Aperture). He has also written an opera called Edison's Last Project(ION) and choral works including Lumiere de Main. The libretto and lyrics of these were published in the book Guests go in to Supper.

Iams graduated from the Ohio State University in 1937, and sold dog food during the Great Depression. He learned that not even severe economic hardship would stop owners from buying food to feed their pets. This was a revelation to Iams, as most owners fed their pets leftovers or their own concoctions. A self-taught animal nutritionist, Iams founded his company in 1946, and, by 1950, was creating his own recipes in his own plant in Dayton. When he retired in 1982, Iams sold his stake in the company to his business partner, who sold the company to Procter & Gamble in 1999. Paul Iams was born in Dayton, Ohio on August 11, 1915. He was a talented high school athlete who won the Ohio State Tennis Championship in 1933. In 1937, he graduated from Ohio State University and became interested in the pet food business while working with his father, Harry, a grain broker. He joined Procter & Gamble in 1938 and was a soap salesman before joining the Navy in World War II. After completing his service, Iams decided to create high quality pet food, based on his original nutritional theories and research. He was convinced that there was a strong specialty market for a nutritionally complete dog food. His original customer base was composed of Midwestern veterinarians and dog breeders. In 1950, he opened his first manufacturing plant in Dayton, Ohio with five employees. He named his first dog food, \\"Iams 999\\" to imply that it was nearly perfect. In 1982, Iams sold the business to Clay Mathile, who had joined Iams in 1970 and was Paul's business partner and friend. In 1999, the Mathiles sold The Iams Company to Procter and Gamble. In 1987, the Paul F. Iams Technical Center in Lewisburg, Ohio was opened as a research facility dedicated to researching the emotional and physical needs of companion animals. Paul Iams died at the age of 89, on Tuesday, October 26, 2004 in Chappaqua, New York. Until a month earlier, he had lived in Sun City West, Arizona where he retired in 1982 with his wife, the former Jane Landrum, who died in 1996.

PDMS is the most widely used silicon-based organic polymer due to its versatility and properties leading to many applications. Wolf, M.P., G.B. Salieb-Beugelaar, and P. Hunziker, PDMS with designer functionalities-Properties, modifications strategies, and applications. Progress in Polymer Science, 2018. 83: p. 97-134 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2018.06.001 It is particularly known for its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear and, in general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. It is one of several types of silicone oil (polymerized siloxane). Its applications range from contact lenses and medical devices to elastomers; it is also present in shampoos (as it makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), caulking, lubricants and heat-resistant tiles. Structure The chemical formula for PDMS is CH3[Si(CH3)2O]nSi(CH3)3, where n is the number of repeating monomer [SiO(CH3)2] units.Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. “Inorganic Polymers” Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. . Industrial synthesis can begin from dimethyldichlorosilane and water by the following net reaction: :n\\\\ce{Si(CH3)2Cl2} + (n+1)\\\\ce{H2O -> HO[-Si(CH3)2O-]_\\\\mathit{n}H} + 2n\\\\ce{HCl} The polymerization reaction evolves hydrochloric acid. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the chlorine atoms in the silane precursor were replaced with acetate groups. In this case, the polymerization produces acetic acid, which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives. =Branching and capping= Hydrolysis of Si(CH3)2Cl2 generates a polymer that is terminated with silanol groups (−Si(CH3)2OH]). These reactive centers are typically \\"capped\\" by reaction with trimethylsilyl chloride: : 2 Si(CH3)3Cl + [Si(CH3)2O]n−2[Si(CH3)2OH]2 → [Si(CH3)2O]n−2[Si(CH3)2O Si(CH3)3]2 \\\\+ 2 HCl Silane precursors with more acid-forming groups and fewer methyl groups, such as methyltrichlorosilane, can be used to introduce branches or cross-links in the polymer chain. Under ideal conditions, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This can be used to produce hard silicone resins. In a similar manner, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain. Well-defined PDMS with a low polydispersity index and high homogeneity is produced by controlled anionic ring-opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane. Using this methodology it is possible to synthesize linear block copolymers, heteroarm star-shaped block copolymers and many other macromolecular architectures. The polymer is manufactured in multiple viscosities, ranging from a thin pourable liquid (when n is very low), to a thick rubbery semi-solid (when n is very high). PDMS molecules have quite flexible polymer backbones (or chains) due to their siloxane linkages, which are analogous to the ether linkages used to impart rubberiness to polyurethanes. Such flexible chains become loosely entangled when molecular weight is high, which results in PDMS' unusually high level of viscoelasticity. Mechanical properties PDMS is viscoelastic, meaning that at long flow times (or high temperatures), it acts like a viscous liquid, similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an elastic solid, similar to rubber. Viscoelasticity is a form of nonlinear elasticity that is common amongst noncrystalline polymers. The loading and unloading of a stress-strain curve for PDMS do not coincide; rather, the amount of stress will vary based on the degree of strain, and the general rule is that increasing strain will result in greater stiffness. When the load itself is removed, the strain is slowly recovered (rather than instantaneously). This time-dependent elastic deformation results from the long-chains of the polymer. But the process that is described above is only relevant when cross-linking is present; when it is not, the polymer PDMS cannot shift back to the original state even when the load is removed, resulting in a permanent deformation. However, permanent deformation is rarely seen in PDMS, since it is almost always cured with a cross-linking agent. If some PDMS is left on a surface overnight (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections. However, if the same PDMS is poured into a spherical mold and allowed to cure (short flow time), it will bounce like a rubber ball. The mechanical properties of PDMS enable this polymer to conform to a diverse variety of surfaces. Since these properties are affected by a variety of factors, this unique polymer is relatively easy to tune. This enables PDMS to become a good substrate that can easily be integrated into a variety of microfluidic and microelectromechanical systems. Specifically, the determination of mechanical properties can be decided before PDMS is cured; the uncured version allows the user to capitalize on myriad opportunities for achieving a desirable elastomer. Generally, the cross-linked cured version of PDMS resembles rubber in a solidified form. It is widely known to be easily stretched, bent, compressed in all directions. Depending on the application and field, the user is able to tune the properties based on what is demanded. Fabric embedded within PDMS. This technique enables a user to retain a thin layer of PDMS as a substrate while achieving a higher stiffness through the insertion of reinforcement. Linear relationship in Sylgard 184 PDMS between curing temperature and Young's modulus Overall PDMS has a low elastic modulus which enables it to be easily deformed and results in the behavior of a rubber. Viscoelastic properties of PDMS can be more precisely measured using dynamic mechanical analysis. This method requires determination of the material's flow characteristics over a wide range of temperatures, flow rates, and deformations. Because of PDMS's chemical stability, it is often used as a calibration fluid for this type of experiment. The shear modulus of PDMS varies with preparation conditions, and consequently dramatically varies in the range of 100 kPa to 3 MPa. The loss tangent is very low . Chemical compatibility PDMS is hydrophobic. Plasma oxidation can be used to alter the surface chemistry, adding silanol (SiOH) groups to the surface. Atmospheric air plasma and argon plasma will work for this application. This treatment renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing water to wet it. The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with trichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's hydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is vacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minutes. Alternatively, for applications where long-term hydrophilicity is a requirement, techniques such as hydrophilic polymer grafting, surface nanostructuring, and dynamic surface modification with embedded surfactants can be of use. Solid PDMS samples (whether surface- oxidized or not) will not allow aqueous solvents to infiltrate and swell the material. Thus PDMS structures can be used in combination with water and alcohol solvents without material deformation. However most organic solvents will diffuse into the material and cause it to swell. Despite this, some organic solvents lead to sufficiently small swelling that they can be used with PDMS, for instance within the channels of PDMS microfluidic devices. The swelling ratio is roughly inversely related to the solubility parameter of the solvent. Diisopropylamine swells PDMS to the greatest extent; solvents such as chloroform, ether, and THF swell the material to a large extent. Solvents such as acetone, 1-propanol, and pyridine swell the material to a small extent. Alcohols and polar solvents such as methanol, glycerol and water do not swell the material appreciably. Applications =Surfactants and antifoaming agents= PDMS is a common surfactant and is a component of defoamers. PDMS, in a modified form, is used as an herbicide penetrant and is a critical ingredient in water-repelling coatings, such as Rain-X.Rain X The Invisible Windshield Wiper. householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov =Hydraulic fluids and related applications= Dimethicone is also the active silicone fluid in automotive viscous limited slip differentials and couplings. This is usually a non-serviceable OEM component but can be replaced with mixed performance results due to variances in effectiveness caused by refill weights or non- standard pressurizations. =Soft lithography= PDMS is commonly used as a stamp resin in the procedure of soft lithography, making it one of the most common materials used for flow delivery in microfluidics chips.PDMS in microfluidics : a review and tutorial. elveflow.com The process of soft lithography consists of creating an elastic stamp, which enables the transfer of patterns of only a few nanometers in size onto glass, silicon or polymer surfaces. With this type of technique, it is possible to produce devices that can be used in the areas of optic telecommunications or biomedical research. The stamp is produced from the normal techniques of photolithography or electron-beam lithography. The resolution depends on the mask used and can reach 6 nm. In biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems (bio- MEMS), soft lithography is used extensively for microfluidics in both organic and inorganic contexts. Silicon wafers are used to design channels, and PDMS is then poured over these wafers and left to harden. When removed, even the smallest of details is left imprinted in the PDMS. With this particular PDMS block, hydrophilic surface modification is conducted using plasma etching techniques. Plasma treatment disrupts surface silicon-oxygen bonds, and a plasma-treated glass slide is usually placed on the activated side of the PDMS (the plasma-treated, now hydrophilic side with imprints). Once activation wears off and bonds begin to reform, silicon-oxygen bonds are formed between the surface atoms of the glass and the surface atoms of the PDMS, and the slide becomes permanently sealed to the PDMS, thus creating a waterproof channel. With these devices, researchers can utilize various surface chemistry techniques for different functions creating unique lab-on-a-chip devices for rapid parallel testing. PDMS can be cross-linked into networks and is a commonly used system for studying the elasticity of polymer networks. PDMS can be directly patterned by surface-charge lithography. PDMS is being used in the making of synthetic gecko adhesion dry adhesive materials, to date only in laboratory test quantities.Inspired by Gecko Feet, UMass Amherst Scientists Invent Super-Adhesive Material . 16 Feb 2012, UMass Press Release Some flexible electronics researchers use PDMS because of its low cost, easy fabrication, flexibility, and optical transparency. =Stereo lithography= In stereo lithography (SLA) 3D printing, light is projected onto photocuring resin to selectively cure it. Some types of SLA printer are cured from the bottom of the tank of resin and therefore require the growing model to be peeled away from the base in order for each printed layer to be supplied with a fresh film of uncured resin. A PDMS layer at the bottom of the tank assists this process by absorbing oxygen : the presence of oxygen adjacent to the resin prevents it adhering to the PDMS, and the optically clear PDMS permits the projected image to pass through to the resin undistorted. =Medicine and cosmetics= Activated dimethicone, a mixture of polydimethylsiloxanes and silicon dioxide (sometimes called simethicone), is often used in over-the- counter drugs as an antifoaming agent and carminative. It has also been at least proposed for use in contact lenses. Silicone breast implants are made out of a PDMS elastomer shell, to which fumed amorphous silica is added, encasing PDMS gel or saline solution. In addition, PDMS is useful as a lice or flea treatment because of its ability to trap insects. It also works as a moisturizer that is lighter and more breathable than typical oils. Skin PDMS is used variously in the cosmetic and consumer product industry as well. For example, PDMS can be used in the treatment of head lice on the scalp and dimethicone is used widely in skin-moisturizing lotions where it is listed as an active ingredient whose purpose is \\"skin protection.\\" Some cosmetic formulations use dimethicone and related siloxane polymers in concentrations of use up to 15%. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review's (CIR) Expert Panel, has concluded that dimethicone and related polymers are \\"safe as used in cosmetic formulations.\\" Hair PDMS compounds such as amodimethicone, are effective conditioners when formulated to consist of small particles and be soluble in water or alcohol/act as surfactants (especially for damaged hair), and are even more conditioning to the hair than common dimethicone and/or dimethicone copolyols. Contact Lenses A proposed use of PDMS is contact lens cleaning. Its physical properties of low elastic modulus and hydrophobicity have been used to clean micro and nano pollutants from contact lens surfaces more effectively than multipurpose solution and finger rubbing; the researchers involved call the technique PoPPR (polymer on polymer pollution removal) and note that it is highly effective at removing nanoplastic that has adhered to lenses. Flea treatment for pets Dimethicone is the active ingredient in a liquid applied to the back of the neck of a cat or dog from a small one time use dose disposable pipette. The parasite becomes trapped and immoblised in the substance and thus breaks the life cycle of the insect. =Foods= PDMS is added to many cooking oils (as an antifoaming agent) to prevent oil splatter during the cooking process. As a result of this, PDMS can be found in trace quantities in many fast food items such as McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, french fries, hash browns, milkshakes and smoothies and Wendy's french fries. Under European food additive regulations, it is listed as E900. = Condom lubricant = PDMS is widely used as a condom lubricant. = Domestic and niche uses = Many people are indirectly familiar with PDMS because it is an important component in Silly Putty, to which PDMS imparts its characteristic viscoelastic properties.Micro Total Analysis Systems, Silly Putty, and Fluorous Peptides. fluorous.com. January 18, 2008 Another toy PDMS is used in is Kinetic Sand. The rubbery, vinegary-smelling silicone caulks, adhesives, and aquarium sealants are also well-known. PDMS is also used as a component in silicone grease and other silicone based lubricants, as well as in defoaming agents, mold release agents, damping fluids, heat transfer fluids, polishes, cosmetics, hair conditioners and other applications. PDMS has also been used as a filler fluid in breast implants. It can be used as a sorbent for the analysis of headspace (dissolved gas analysis) of food. Safety and environmental considerations According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, no \\"marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment\\" have been noted for siloxanes. PDMS is nonbiodegradable, but is absorbed in waste water treatment facilities. Its degradation is catalyzed by various clays.Moretto, Hans-Heinrich; Schulze, Manfred and Wagner, Gebhard (2005) \\"Silicones\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

Such marsh views are emblematic of the Lowcountry and its landscapes. The Lowcountry (sometimes Low Country or just low country) is a geographic and cultural region along South Carolina's coast, including the Sea Islands. Once known for its slave-based agricultural wealth in rice and indigo dye, that flourished in the hot subtropical climate, the Lowcountry today is known for its historic cities and communities, natural environment, cultural heritage, and tourism industry. Geography Definitions of the \\"Lowcountry\\" area always include the counties in dark red, less often those in lighter shades. The term \\"Low Country\\" originally was all the state below the Fall Line, or the Sandhills which run the width of the state from Aiken County to Chesterfield County. The Sandhills or Carolina Sandhills is a 15-60 km wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, along the inland margin of this province. The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago.Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, \\"The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States\\": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds. The area above the Sandhills was known as \\"Upstate\\" or \\"Upcountry\\". These areas are different in geology, geography, and culture. There are several variations on the geographic extent of the Lowcountry area. The most commonly accepted definition includes the counties of Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton, and Jasper; often described as the area between the Savannah and Ashley Rivers. These four are covered by the Lowcountry Council of Governments, a regional governmental entity charged with regional and transportation planning,Lowcountry Council of Governments official website. and are the ones included in the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism's \\"Lowcountry and Resort Islands\\" area.Tourism Regions (map) at South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism official website. The area includes the Hilton Head Island- Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. A larger geographic definition for the Lowcountry often includes Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester counties. Less frequently, the term is applied to Allendale, Georgetown, and Williamsburg counties. Rarely, it is applied to Horry County, home to Myrtle Beach and Conway and more often considered its own region (The Grand Strand) or part of the state's Pee Dee Region. Orangeburg County can be included in the Lowcountry region. (Orangeburg County has a relatively large land area; it can be classified as the Lowcountry, CSRA, and the Midlands.) Architecture One of the most distinctive elements of the South Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry is the architecture. Lowcountry style home architecture developed in the late 1700s and is still constructed today as the most efficient design for the subtropical climate of the low country. Lowcountry buildings have historically been constructed of timber and set on pilings or had a raised first floor. The raised first floor was a response to the often swampy environment, high water tables, and tropical cyclone flooding. The underfloor space is often screened with lattice and used for storage or a carport. Lowcountry homes typically have broad hipped roofs that extend over deep and large covered front porches accented by columns or pillars, that allow a shady sitting area and are often used as another living space. Large windows are used to allow warm inside air to escape in the cooler evening. Most modern Lowcountry homes feature a central open breezeway through the entire house allowing a cooling breeze to move through the building. Economy Originally dependent on plantation agriculture based on indigo, rice and cotton, the Lowcountry economy developed other sectors in the 20th century. =Tourism= Hilton Head Island is one of the most popular resort destinations in the United States. Tourism dominates the economy in much of the Lowcountry. Among the attractions are resorts, historic and cultural sites, and natural features, including Hunting Island State Park, Edisto State Park and other local, state, and federally protected or preserved lands and wetlands. The area offers many destinations for golf, tennis, and beach vacations on Hilton Head Island, Fripp Island, Seabrook Island, Kiawah Island, and the Wild Dunes portion of the Isle of Palms. Hilton Head's Sea Pines Plantation was an early resort in the 1950s. Longstanding seaside communities, including Edisto Beach, Folly Beach, Sullivan's Island, and the Isle of Palms remain popular destinations for visitors and a growing number of permanent residents and second-home owners. Charleston attracts millions of visitors each year. Beaufort offers cultural activities and sightseeing, while some of the smaller communities in the region have certain cultural activities or amenities that attract thousands of visitors per year. Highway or traveler commercial services are of particular importance to communities in the Lowcountry (including Mount Pleasant, North Charleston, Goose Creek, Charleston and Summerville) and along Interstate 95 (including St. George, Walterboro, and Hardeeville). =Trade and retail= The Port of Charleston has several shipping terminals. Much of the Lowcountry's economy revolves around manufacturing, transportation, logistics and other port-related business. The Port of Charleston, owned and operated by the South Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA), is one of the ten busiest U.S. ports and handles over $60 billion in goods each year. Major shippers include Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, Evergreen Marine Corporation, COSCO and Hamburg Süd. The SCSPA is building a terminal at the old Naval Base in North Charleston, South Carolina, and has plans to build a new ocean terminal port in southern Jasper County by 2020, in conjunction with the Georgia Ports Authority under a bi-state commission. A port facility in Port Royal closed in 2005. Major manufacturers in North Charleston include Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Robert Bosch GmbH fuel injection and anti-lock braking components, Cummins (diesel engine components), Marathon Petroleum, Mercedes-Benz vans, and Westrock paper and packaging. Volvo Cars opened its first American manufacturing facility in Ridgeville, Berkeley County in 2018, where it manufactures the S60 sedan. Information technology companies in Charleston and Berkeley Counties include Blackbaud, a software company headquartered in Charleston that employs hundreds of workers at its Daniel Island facility. North Charleston has the region's largest volume of retail sales. Specialty retail, including arts and crafts, souvenirs, and antiques is big in the historic areas of Charleston, Summerville, Beaufort, Port Royal and Walterboro. Major shopping complexes in the area include the Citadel Mall in Charleston, the Northwoods Mall, Tanger Factory Outlets and Centre Point in North Charleston and Tanger Factory Outlets in Bluffton, the Mount Pleasant Town Centre in Mount Pleasant, and Shelter Cove Towne Centre on Hilton Head Island. Major shopping districts in the area include the City Market and King Street in Charleston, Savannah Highway in West Ashley (Charleston suburb), Daniel Island (Charleston suburb), North Charleston, Johnny Dodds Boulevard in Mount Pleasant, Boundary Street and Bay Street in Beaufort, and U.S. 278 in Bluffton and Hilton Head Island. St. George, Walterboro, Point South, Ridgeland, and Hardeeville provide motorist services along Interstate 95. =Military= Marine recruits on the Chosin Range, located at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. Tens of thousands of active duty and reserve military personnel are stationed in and near Lowcountry bases, including Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps facilities. The South Carolina National Guard has several outposts located here as well. Military facilities in the Lowcountry include the Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic in Goose Creek/Hanahan, the Charleston Air Force Base in North Charleston, and the Naval Weapons Station Charleston in Goose Creek, which includes a Naval Consolidated Brig in Hanahan. A former naval yard was closed in 1995. Facilities in and near Beaufort include the Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island, the U.S. Naval Hospital in Port Royal, and the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Culture Grits is one of several staples of Lowcountry cuisine. The region's culture has Southern, Native American, European, Caribbean, and African roots. Among the more notable are the Gullah influence on St. Helena Island, the early European settlements near Beaufort and Port Royal, and the Caribbean influence on architecture in Charleston. Charleston and Beaufort have dozens of ante- and postbellum homes, with unique blends and styles of architecture. The South Carolina Artisans Center is located in Walterboro. =Food= Wildlife Among the low country, there is an abundance of wildlife, which ranges from fiddler crabs all the way to otters. These animals hide, grow up in, and flourish in the marsh grass known as Spartina. All animals that live in the low country move constantly with the ever-changing tides. https://www.seenmagazine.us/Articles/Article- Detail/ArticleId/1691/South-Carolina’s-marsh-is-teeming-with-life-that- changes-with-the-seasons See also * Lower Coastal Plain (Georgia) *Midlands of South Carolina *Upstate South Carolina References * External links *The Lowcountry & Resort Islands Tourism Commission Category:Regions of South Carolina Category:Gullah country ","title":"South Carolina Lowcountry"},{"id":"1151140","text":"is a seven-volume BL manga by Sanami Matoh.

There is currently no news on North American licensing.Anime News Network News Article. Accessed 2007-05-13 Summary Randy \\"Ryo\\" Maclean, a half-Japanese cop, is new to the 27th Precinct in New York, and he is partnered with Dee Laytner, an American with an overconfident attitude. Dee has a great amount of romantic interest in Ryo, but Ryo isn't sure about his own feelings for his partner or even what to think of another man or woman hitting on him. It's one misadventure and awkward moment to the next as the two of them try to sort out their relationship and feelings, while still keeping up with their jobs and their normal lives. Other noteworthy characters are Bikky and Carol, two kids who have lost their families and have been taken in by Ryo, and subsequently by Dee. A few of the acts focus on the very sweet young love that develops between those two. JJ and Drake are other detectives from the 27th, and JJ, completely obsessed with Dee, becomes quite jealous of Ryo, and that of course makes for some interesting moments throughout the story, although JJ moves his attentions to Drake towards the end of the series. Berkeley Rose has a similar fancy for Ryo. He isn't shy about it either, going so far as to steal a kiss whenever possible, much to the irritation of both Dee and Ryo.  Characters  ; : : A dark-haired young American cop who dislikes trouble-makers, which is ironic, since he seems to be one himself. His personality can switch from boisterous and inappropriate to serious and calm instantly. Though moody at times, he cares very much for the people around him. He is in love with Ryo, but has dated women in the past; in Dee's own words, he has several types of women he likes, but Ryo is the only and perfect man for him to love (though he admits to being bisexual from the start which seems to have occurred sometime after his teen years and appears to have had sexual experiences with other men prior to meeting Ryo). :Dee may seem to be rude and intrusive, but he has a strict sense of honor that will not allow him to take advantage of anybody; however his parameters can often be well outside the norm. He claims to hate children but understands Bikky's motives well, often acting the part of the wicked uncle when Ryo tries to impose a bit of discipline upon the unruly boy. Dee is fiercely protective of both Carol and Bikky, and is well liked by the children who now live at the orphanage where he and his childhood friend Tommy grew up. :The surname \\"Laytner\\" is made up; the name of the cop who found him in an alleyway was Jess Latener. Seeing him as a father figure even after he was revealed to be less than perfect, Dee was proud to take a similar name to the strict Jess. Dee is searching for stability in his life. Dee claims at first to have been trying to get Ryo to lighten up by kissing him but falls in love with him. ; : :Also known as Ryō, is a half-Japanese officer and Dee's partner. A shy and sensitive man, he lost both parents at the age of eighteen. While he seems to be a little \\"out of it\\", he is very mature and his attention comes into play when it counts. He takes in the young Bikky to live with him early on in the story, and of course, he needs every ounce of smarts to keep the boy out of trouble. Often, he tries to deflect Dee's advances, but to little effect. :Ryo is unsure of what he really wants, but seems to care a lot about his partner nonetheless. He is uncomfortable with being constantly called by his Japanese name since this implies a certain degree of intimacy, and he is a very private man. However as Dee imposes this name upon him others begin to adopt it, and gradually he is forced to be more open. Highly suggestible, Ryo ponders frequently over the advice given to him by others and at times he questions his own view of himself, which tends to make him depressed. :Ryo loves children and tries to surround himself with warmth and affection. He is very compassionate, cares little for money but saves conscientiously and likes flowers. He has a strong idea of how he wants things to be, but Dee tends to spoil these plans, with his casual attitude to tidiness and his confusing behavior. While Ryo comes across to those who don't know him as friendly and shy, at times the control he has over his actions is broken by Bikky or Dee, exposing a more violent side. This appears to upset him on occasion, and may be part of the reason that Dee makes him uneasy. At first Ryo is confused by Dee's advances and also why he lets him especially since he considers himself straight. He gradually warms to him, appearing jealous when other people kiss Dee. He eventually accepts who he is and how he feels about Dee. ; : :Bikky is bi-racial, African American young boy with golden hair who is around 10 at the start of the series. Bikky generally behaves in front of Ryo, and treats him like a father. Bikky swiftly makes it known that he dislikes Dee, especially for the fact that Dee has his eye on Ryo. Fearing that Dee may hurt Ryo since he used to be an active womanizer, and being not used to homosexuality in his surroundings, Bikky swears to protect Ryo from Dee's advances, engaging in any tactics he can to keep them apart. However, as the story moves on, Bikky's respect for the man slowly increases, and while he still doesn't fully like Dee being with Ryo he decides to stop trying to break them up, settling for \\"loving to hate\\" Dee instead. He is not particularly intelligent, often falling asleep in class with even Ryo admitting Bikky would only make it to college through his athleticism. Nonetheless, he is shown to be street savvy, have good common sense and instincts when it comes to people, and does possess some talent in less than legal skills such as pickpocketing, poker, and stealing tires off of bikes (things Ryo reprimands him for). By Fake Second Season, he has shot up in height (growing up taller than Dee) and dating Carol though he moves to go to college he promises to come and visit often. :The alternative spelling of his name is Vikky, however like Carol's name in the OAV, they used a different spelling. When TOKYOPOP released the manga, Cal was changed back to Carol (see below), however they continued to use Bikky's translated name throughout the series. :It can be assumed that Ryo adopted Bikky as when he is introduced in volume one of the original manga Bikky's surname is Goldman, but in 'FAKE \\"Second Season\\"' he introduces himself as Bikky Maclean. ; : :Bikky's childhood friend around 13 years old. She states that she doesn't want to date anyone until she's eighteen, because that's when her father, who is currently in a police hospital, met her mother. She is not a stranger to crime—she hopes to collect enough money to pay her father's bail—but her pickpocketing puts her in a dangerous situation. Flirtatious at times, she repels unwanted advances strongly, letting potential suitors know exactly what she thinks of them. Carol has extremely high self-esteem and is unlikely to let anybody get the better of her without a fight. However, despite the age difference(she's three years older) by Fake Second Season she and Bikky are a strong couple, though she states she'll kill him should he ever try to cheat. :Carol's name has also been translated as Cal or Chal. Technically, all variations are correct, and although Carol seems the most likely spelling for a Western name, \\"Chal\\" has in fact been used on official merchandise. Unlike Bikky, she likes the idea of Dee and Ryo as a couple and tries to help them, clocking Bikky when he goes too far. ; : :A former classmate of Dee's at the police academy, he is an expert marksman, second only to Ryo. He shows his serious side only rarely; his time is usually spent trying to get \\"Sex God\\" Dee to return his love. JJ truly believes that people are good. This is intrinsic to his worldview. He cares very strongly for those close to him, and holds a surprisingly pacifistic outlook considering his profession. JJ acts very childlike at times, and this causes his colleagues to dismiss him automatically. However he proves to be a very good listener, despite the fact that he doesn't usually appear to be taking things in. Later in the manga, he gives up on his pursuit of Dee and accepts Ryo being with him; few days after that, he steals a kiss from his partner Drake Parker and asks him out for a date. ; : :Berkeley first encountered Ryo and Dee while the two were on holiday in the Lake District. Dee took an instant dislike to the man, and the feeling seemed to be mutual. Initially Berkeley seemed to be rumored straight; however it later becomes apparent that much of Berkeley's hostility towards Dee stems from jealousy- he is desperately attracted to Ryo. Dee eventually begins to take notice of this, viewing Berkeley as a genuine threat rather than an object of mockery. :Berkeley is remarkably similar to Dee in many aspects, but comes across as a colder, more distant man in the surface. He treats police work with a similar distance, letting slip comments that show he views the investigation of the English murders as something of a game. His gaze is extremely penetrating -- Ryo doesn't like meeting his eyes. He is not afraid of abusing his position as Commissioner to get closer to what he wants. While he seems focused, Berkeley may be concentrating too hard on one thing while letting other opportunities slip away. Diana is in love with him, but Berkeley rejects her fearing his own emotions until the very end. ; :An outgoing and flamboyant FBI agent, Diana enjoys sparring with Dee. As a relentless flirt who constantly violates the dress code, she is not afraid to use her sexuality as a weapon, and Bikky is in awe of her. A martial arts practitioner, Diana is fully able to defend herself in potentially dangerous situations. However, for all her brashness, Diana is truly in love with Berkeley, who treats her as more of a sister figure. She is willing to do anything to wake Berkeley up to the fact that she has desires too, and finally gets him to declare his love for her. ; :JJ's partner. A perpetual loser. Forever dumped by his girlfriends, Drake seems to be the most slobbish man in the NYPD 27th. A cheapskate, slacker and hopeless at getting up in the mornings, Drake needs to settle down with someone who cares about him enough to fix his many problems. In the manga story \\"Like Like Love\\", JJ confesses to him that he's stopped pursuing Dee, and after Drake comforts him JJ kisses him and says they should have a date to fix their love lives. ; :Almost nothing is known about Ted, but as the fifth regular investigator in Ryo and Dee's office, he deserves a mention. Like Drake, he shows little respect towards the Chief. Ted is notable for having surprised fans of the black and white manga when he made a brief appearance at the end of the OVA with flaming red hair. ; :The Chief of Police at the NYPD's 27th precinct. The badger analogies are frequent; retribution violent. While most of the NYPD show him little respect on a daily basis, Ryo in particular holds him in high esteem, and sees him as something of a father figure to the young men under his command, a fact which the others may or may not acknowledge. He seems gruff and flustered at the best of times, and rarely gives in under pressure unless he believes the matter to be trivial. In Act 11, a flashback reveals that his first name is Warren. ; :A crossover character from another of Matoh Sanami's works Ra-i. While he has a short temper and initially doesn't get along with Bikky, the two soon become great friends. He is Asian and comes from a wealthy family with an older brother (who owns a large company and specializes in knife throwing) and an older married sister. He has a friendly rivalry with Bikky and loves Lass, whom he is protective of. He has telekinetic powers that allow him to float in mid air though he tries hard to hide it (despite the fact many have seen his abilities firsthand). Like Bikky, he is brash, aggressive, has a short temper but is kind hearted and will protect people from harm, especially those close to him. ; :A crossover character from another of Matoh Sanami' works Ra-i. Unlike with Bikky and Rai, she gets along quite well with Carol upon first meeting and treat each other like sisters. She has telepathic powers that allow her to see visions like when she correctly figures out where Rai is after he is kidnapped, though tries to hide them (only Rai is fully aware). She is in love with Rai and is polite, calm, friendly, shy, and sweet. ; :A forensics expert who wears glasses and has good observational skills, managing to notice Dee's feelings for Ryo upon first meeting them and also warning Dee that people like Ryo who look nice and quiet on the outside are actually turbulent on the inside. ; :The new chief of SCIU who looks over the main characters as their new boss after they move out of the 27th precinct. He had a son who was murdered by a female serial killer who murdered children because she hated their disobedient personalities, which came from her own hatred towards her own children whom she abused for misbehaving. Anime Fake was adapted into a one-hour OVA based on volume two of the manga. The Japanese voice actor cast is notable, with such famous names as Tomokazu Seki playing Dee, Nobuo Tobita playing Ryo, and Rica Matsumoto both playing Bikky and singing the closing theme, \\"Starlight Heaven\\". It has aired in the U.S. on Logo as part of an anthology series dedicated to LGBT-themed animation and geek culture called Alien Boot Camp. It premiere in two parts, the first half on November 9, 2007, and the second a week later on November 16, 2007. Dee and Ryo are on vacation at a charming English hotel by a lake. Ryo is hoping to get some peace and relaxation; Dee is hoping to get some Ryo. However, things take a bad turn when a dead body is found floating in the lake. Dee and Ryo don't want to do police work when they're on vacation, but it's hard to avoid it when a case falls in your lap! They meet two other guests, Arisa and Cindy. Arisa and Ryo bond over the fact that they're both of Japanese descent while Arisa also bonds with Dee over Dee's unrequited love, as Arisa herself had waited six years for the man she loves to propose. After a pleasant day together, strange sounds are heard in the darkness of the hotel lobby. Investigating, Ryo and Dee meet Berkeley Rose, a New York cop who has decided to investigate the murder as \\"a fun way to kill time\\". From that point on relaxation becomes impossible as surprise guests come pouring in—first Bikky and Carol, then JJ. In a town nearby, Berkeley figures out who the murderers are, and why they kill any Japanese who cross their path. Problem is, Dee just left Ryo back at the hotel with the killer, and JJ let it slip that Ryo is half-Japanese!

This iconic image of the Madonna and Child, seen throughout the history of western art, holds significant value in terms of stylistic innovations of religious subject matter that would continue to evolve for centuries.  Description and influences  Duccio's Madonna and Child, or Stoclet Madonna, has only been widely acknowledged as Duccio's work for the past century, and accessible to scholars for only half a century.Christiansen, Keith. \\"Recent Acquisitions, A Selection: 2004–2005.\\" Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 63 (Fall 2005), pp. 14–15, ill. on cover (color, cropped) and p. 14 (color). Comparing the compact size of this work of 11X8 1/8 in. to larger, more illustrious altarpieces and large scale frescoes, the Madonna and Child is understood to be an intimate, devotional image. Some evocations of this understanding come from the burnt edges on the bottom of the original engaged frame caused by burning candles that likely would have sat just beneath.Christiansen, Keith. \\"The Metropolitan's Duccio.\\" Apollo (London, England) 165.(2007): 40–47. Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson). Web. 18 Apr. 2012. Looking past the abrupt simplicity of the image, one can begin to understand the changes Duccio was applying to the depiction of religious figures in painting during the early 14th century. Duccio followed other innovative Italian artists of the time like Giotto, both of whom strove to move beyond the purely iconic Byzantine canon and attempted to create a more tangible connection between the viewer and the objects in the painting. For example, the parapet that sits at the bottom of the painting works as a visual enticement for the viewer to look past and into the moment that is captured between the Virgin and Christ Child. At the same time, the parapet also acts as a barrier between the vernacular world and the sacred.  Aesthetic influences  Many other elements of Duccio's interest in humanism are prevalent and can be seen in the tenderly draped robe worn by the Madonna and on Christ's lap, the childish reach of his hand to the Virgin's somewhat austere gaze back as she anticipates Christ's future, the luminous colors employed to the garments, and the fine details found on the inner layer of the Virgin's veil.Christiansen, Keith. \\"Recent Acquisitions, A Selection: 2004–2005.\\" Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 63 (Fall 2005), pp. 14–15, ill. on cover (color, cropped) and p. 14 (color) It is these distinct qualities that would shape the sensibility of later Sienese painting and that give Duccio's Madonna and Child such worthy attention and credibility in the history of art. Other details found in this image are ones that stay behind in Byzantine tradition and characterize earlier works of Duccio, while the more innovative qualities prosper over time. The details in the gold background are minute and difficult to notice at a far glance but add an important element to the iconicism of the image. Punched designs were employed for the halos and the border design, all of which were hand inscribed.  History of ownership  The Madonna and Child carries somewhat of a mysterious history in terms of its location for five centuries. Many questions about this timeless image remain unanswered in terms of where or whom it came from before the mid 19th Century, which is not actually unusual for duecento and trecento paintings. In 1904 the painting was displayed at the Mostra d’arte antica senese, an exhibition at the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena. The first known owner of the painting brought it to the exhibition organizers whom enabled it to be shown. This person is known to be Count Gregori Stroganoff (1829–1910)http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the- collections/110003462 who held the Duccio as part of his vast collection of art pieces of all disciplines. There are no known records of who owned or where Duccio's Madonna and Child was held up to the possession of Stroganoff. Stated in her review of the 1904 Mostra d’art senese exhibition, art historian, Mary Logan Berenson believes this work to be among Duccio's “most perfect” pieces, therefore it is no surprise the painting caused an awe- inspiring reaction from exhibition viewers and especially from those in the art and art history arena. Following the death of Stroganoff in 1910, the Duccio joined the assembly of works collected by Adolphe Stoclet (1871–1949), hence the painting's namesake, the Stoclet Madonna. Stoclet was understood to treat his fruitful collection of art with the most careful attention and held them in the most ideal environments to preserve their unique, and many times fragile, qualities. The Duccio was shown at few exhibitions in 1930 and 1935 and to chosen, limited guests of Stoclet at his home. Proceeding the death of Stoclet and his wife in 1949, their children inherited Duccio's Madonna and Child along with the rest of the collector's assemblage. Although the coveted work of art was of interest to scholars, they were unable to access it except through photographs that fortunately document the ages of the painting and its process of restoration. Photographs of before it was restored, and later minor retouching, to what we see now all of which reveal the time past and the true impression of the original painting of 1300. The painting was excitingly acquired in the autumn of 2004 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an estimated amount of 45 million USD.smarthistory.khanacademy.org/duccio- madonna.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/10/arts/design/the-met-makes-its- biggest-purchase-ever.htmlhttps://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2004/met- pay-45m-for-duccio-s-stroganoff-madonna/ This is a highly valuable acquisition not only for the aesthetic significance in terms of the history of art, but also because there are only 13 known paintings by Duccio in the world.  Controversy  There is debate between scholars of what the most accurate chronology of Duccio's Madonna and Child is. There is more than 20 years of time where scholars do not have accounted works by Duccio leaving a questionable, although fairly certain estimation of the Madonna and Child to be made around 1300. Due to the fact that some qualities of the painting are Bysantinesque like the oval shape of the Virgin's face and her elegantly long nose, and also of the “miniature man” nature of Christ Child, the lack of consensus of when it was created proceeds. But, there are of course many innovative elements to the painting which align it appropriately in the time that is now acknowledged to be most accurate. Along with the humanistic qualities between the Virgin and Christ Child, and the elegant draping, the marble parapet is a notable detail to the intentions of the painting, and serves as a visual invitation that encourages the viewer to engage more emotionally to the image. This idea would continue on in a myriad of paintings proceeding this work. Attribution The late James Beck, Professor of Art History at Columbia University in New York, believed that Duccio's Madonna and Child, which the Met dates to 1300, is the work of a 19th-century artist or forger based on stylistic grounds. He pointed to what he considers to be the low quality of the painting and elements of content that he claims had not yet appeared in artwork of that period. Professor Beck said: \\"We are asked to believe that the modest little picture represents a leap into the future of Western painting by establishing a plane in front of Mary and the Child. This feature, a characteristic of Renaissance not Medieval pictures, occurs only a hundred years after the presumptive date of the picture ...\\". Beck's conclusions were published in 2007 in his book, From Duccio to Raphael: Connoisseurship in Crisis in which he also disputes the attribution of the National Gallery of London's painting Madonna of the Pinks to Raphael. Keith Christiansen, the Met's curator of European paintings, disagrees with Beck's contention. Christiansen has noted that, in addition to stylistic analysis of the painting in relation to other known works by the painter, the museum conducted a thorough examination of the painting, including the wooden panel's construction, the painting's underdrawing and pigment composition and found them consistent with an attribution to Duccio and a date of around 1300. Christiansen said: \\"What everyone else sees as a sign of quality and innovation, Beck sees as weakness. There is no reason to doubt the period and authenticity of the picture.\\" References External links * Category:Paintings by Duccio Category:1300s paintings Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Paintings of the Madonna and Child ","title":"Madonna and Child (Duccio)"},{"id":"1151161","text":"Riccarton is a suburb of Christchurch. It is due west of the city centre, separated from it by Hagley Park. Upper Riccarton is to the west of Riccarton. History On 12 April 1840, the ship Sarah and Elizabeth landed Herriot, McGillivray, Ellis, Shaw (and wife) and McKinnon (with his wife and child) who established a farm at Riccarton. They were the first European settlers on the plains.\\" In January 1841, they abandoned their attempt to farm in the area. Riccarton House was the homestead commissioned by Jane Deans in circa 1855. The Deans brothers, who along with the Gebbies and the Mansons were the second group of Europeans to settle in Christchurch on the same site as the first group in 1843. A replica of their original cob cottage is on the grounds. Riccarton House is now a restaurant and function centre, and conducts regular tours. The Deans brothers, John and William, named the suburb after the parish in Ayrshire, Scotland, in which they were born. They were also responsible for naming the River Avon after the river of the same name in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Antonio Hall is located on Riccarton Road. A large property with 279 rooms and once described as \\"one of the finest in Christchurch and vicinity\\", it has been left to decay despite a Category II listing with Heritage New Zealand. In July 2019, 30% of the building was lost to a fire started by a 14 year old youth. The Al Noor Mosque on Deans Avenue was the site of a mass shooting during the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019. Riccarton Bush Adjacent to Riccarton House is Riccarton Bush, a prominent feature also known as Deans Bush (). The Māori word Pūtaringamotu means either ‘the place of an echo’ or ‘the severed ear’. The latter is a metaphoric expression referring to ‘bush isolated from the rest’. It is one of only four remnants of the original forest that covered the Canterbury plains, escaping the huge fires that swept across the province during the moa hunter period. Another remnant, at Papanui, was cut down in the 1850s. The other two remnants were at Kaiapoi and Rangiora. It is dominated by kahikatea trees. A predator- proof perimeter fence has now been erected, with the hope of reintroducing kiwi to the reserve. In 1848, Scots brothers John and William Deans signed an agreement with the New Zealand Company to protect what was originally about 22 hectares of the kahikatea forest at Pūtaringamotu. In 1914, the 6.4 hectares that remained of Deans Bush was formally protected, spearheaded by prominent citizens of Christchurch, including Harry Ell and botanist Dr. Leonard Cockayne. Riccarton Bush has played an important role in the history of New Zealand entomology, a number of native insects were first collected and named from Riccarton Bush. One of the first collections was of a plume moth Pterophorus monospilalis in 1859 which is now in the Fereday collection held in the Canterbury Museum. Thirty nine families of Lepidoptera are found in New Zealand; 27 of these occur in Riccarton Bush. The moths of Riccarton Bush represent the majority of these families. The bag moth Mallobathra metrosema is only known to occur in Riccarton Bush.  Riccarton Racecourse Hotel  The Riccarton Racecourse Hotel is considered to be one of the most haunted places in New Zealand. It is said that the ghost of former licensee Donald Fraser walks the corridors of the hotel looking for his killer. In 1933, Fraser was murdered in the dead of night in his bedroom, where his wife was sleeping, by two blasts from a double-barrelled shotgun. Despite investigations, nobody was found guilty of the crime.New Zealand's spookiest stories Governance Until local government amalgamation in 1989, Riccarton was an independent borough. Since then, Riccarton is represented by the Halswell-Hornby-Riccarton community board. In the 2019 local government elections, Catherine Chu was elected as Councillor for the Riccarton ward. Economy Riccarton is home to Westfield Riccarton, which at approximately is one of New Zealand's largest shopping malls. The mall was first opened as Riccarton Mall in 1965, and has since undergone multiple redevelopments and expansions. The most recent of these took place in 2009, with the addition of a second floor and new carpark building, while plans for further expansions into neighbouring property are within the design process. This development underpins much of the economic activity in Riccarton, with the nearby stretch of Riccarton Road also a busy retail area with numerous motels. Population Riccarton is one of most culturally diverse suburbs of Christchurch. In 2013, 36% of residents were not born in New Zealand, compared with 22% for the city as a whole. The most common ethnicity in 2013 was European (67%), followed by Asian (24%), Māori (8%), Pacific peoples (4%), Middle Eastern-Latin American-African (2%) and other ethnicity (2%). After English, the next most common languages spoken are Tagalog, Sinitic, Northern Chinese and te reo Māori. Places of worship cover a variety of faiths, including Christian churches, the Yolin Assemblies of God Korean Church, the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist temple, a Sikh temple on Kilmarnock St, and the Al Noor Mosque. The suburb is home to many of Christchurch's 2000 Muslim residents. Due to its proximity to the University of Canterbury, Riccarton is also home to many Christchurch students. The population of Riccarton is disproportionately younger as a result, with nearly 40 percent of the suburb's population being aged between 15 and 30 years old as of 2014.

The first of a two-Test tour to Argentina by the Wales national rugby union team was played in 2006 in Puerto Madryn, a 27–25 win for Argentina. Puerto Madryn is home to two football clubs; Club Social y Atlético Guillermo Brown, who play in Nacional B and Deportivo Madryn that currently play in Torneo Argentino B. A basketball team, Deportivo Puerto Madryn, plays in the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol (LNB). Their home arena is known as the Deportivo Puerto Madryn Arena. El Tehuelche Airport is located 10 km (6 miles) northwest of the city centre. Commercial flights from Buenos Aires, Ushuaia, and other Argentinian cities are available. Most tourists fly into Trelew Airport as flights into Puerto Madryn are restricted as a result of environmental concerns. Geography and climate Puerto Madryn is situated in Chubut on the Golfo Nuevo, which is formed by the Valdés Peninsula and Punta Ninfas. The climate is that of a temperate desert zone, with an annual precipitation of between 150 and 200 mm (6\\" to 8\\"). History The town was founded on 28 July 1865, when 150 Welsh immigrants arriving aboard the clipper Mimosa named the natural port Porth Madryn in honour of Sir Love Jones-Parry, whose estate in Wales was called \\"Madryn\\". Conditions were difficult and the settlers had to dig irrigation ditches for their first crops. The settlement grew as a result of the building of the Central Chubut Railway by Welsh, Spanish, and Italian immigrants. This line, opened in 1889, linked the town to Trelew via the lower Chubut River valley. Puerto Madryn was the port to which Argentine prisoners of war captured in the Falklands Islands during the 1982 war were repatriated on the vessels SS Canberra and MV Norland, which sailed from Port Stanley on 18 June 1982.
