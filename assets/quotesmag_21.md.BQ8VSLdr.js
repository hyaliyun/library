This tusk was donated to the Museum. This tusk, which is nearly five foot long, illustrates forty three events in the life of the Buddha and is thought to have been made by early 20th century craftsmen from the Delhi region. Description The use of the complete ivory tusks for carving was popular in 18th and 19th century India, particularly in the Delhi region apart from Burma. Similar whole tusk carvings are also found in the Ivory Coast, Congo and Benin but made from the tusks of African elephants. The art of ivory carving in India is very ancient with references found in Kalidasa's Meghad≈´ta. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at Taxila. Ivory carving flourished in Assam and Mysore where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage. This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of Buddha in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to Mahaparinirvana. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting Bhumisparsha mudra, Abhayamudra and Dharmachakrapravatan mudra besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty. Scenes The story runs from bottom to top and is arranged clockwise. =Pre Enlightenment Life Events of Buddha= File:Depiction of Palaces and architecture, probably Kapilavastu Roundel 1 buddha ivory tusk.jpgDepiction of Kapilavastu, where prince Siddharatha lived The first roundel shows mountains, flora-fauna and architecture which gives the impression of a town probably Kapilavastu.

He also added that a special envoy will be sent to South Sudan on an urgent diplomatic mission to ease talks and reassure their South Sudanese counterparts that Egypt would help them overcome the crisis. The delegation later arrived on December 27 led by Deputy Minister for African Affairs Hamdi Sanad Loza and met with South Sudan's President Salva Kiir announcing that Egypt \\"will support all regional efforts aimed at reaching a quick solution to the current crisis and has full confidence that all parties want to contain the crisis before it escalates\\". In addition, Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi dispatched a military aircraft that took off from an airbase on Friday morning in Egypt carrying humanitarian aid to South Sudan which was described by Loza as \\"a small contribution to help overcome the emergency humanitarian crisis the people of South Sudan are going through\\". The shipment contained urgent aid consisting of eight tonnes of food and medical supplies aimed at helping its people amid the current humanitarian crisis. \\\\- Gambia's Secretary General and Head of the Civil Service and Minister of Presidential Affairs Momodou Sabally said that the attempted overthrow of Kiir's government was unacceptable and that the protagonists of the attempt should desist from destabilising the country. \\\\- Nigeria also condemned the coup and said that its \\"information further reveals that government forces were able to beat back the rebels...Destruction of property on a level yet to be determined has also been reported\\". \\\\- After the fighting spread, South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, condemned the coup attempt stating \\"South Africa firmly believes that respect for democracy and human rights are essential to the governance of all African countries and that all violent means to overthrow legitimate governments must be rejected...It is therefore highly unfortunate that an attempt was allegedly made to undermine the stability of the country.\\" \\\\- Uganda's president said on Monday the nations of East Africa had agreed to move in to defeat South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar if he rejected a ceasefire offer, threatening to turn an outburst of ethnic fighting into a regional conflict. \\"We gave Riek Machar four days to respond (to the ceasefire offer) and if he doesn't we shall have to go for him, all of us,\\" Museveni told reporters in South Sudan's capital, Juba, referring to a 31 December deadline.Asked what that meant, Museveni said: \\"to defeat him\\". He did not spell out whether South Sudan's neighbors had actually agreed to send troops to join the conflict that erupted in Juba on 15 December.But his words underlined the scale of regional concern over the fighting that has spread to South Sudan's oil-producing states - often along ethnic lines, between Machar's group, the Nuer, and President Salva Kiir's Dinka. =Asia= \\\\- India issued an advisory for all its nationals not to travel to South Sudan and has asked those residing there to leave. India also announced that it would send a team to conduct a on-ground assessment of the political and security situation in South Sudan. The team will review the arrangements for the Indian mission staff in Juba and the conditions of Indian residents in South Sudan as well as the 2,000 Indian soldiers who are part of the UN peacekeeping force. =Europe= \\\\- The UK government announced it was sending an aircraft to evacuate its citizens from Juba on 19 December. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had also warned against all travel to South Sudan and temporarily withdrew some staff and dependants from the British embassy. \\\\- In his first Urbi et Orbi Christmas message, Pope Francis called for \\"social harmony in South Sudan, where current tensions have already caused numerous victims and are threatening peaceful coexistence in that young state.\\" =North America= \\\\- In the first days of the conflict, the U.S. embassy in the country reported that while it was aware of \\"security incidents and sporadic gunfire in multiple locations\\" it could not confirm \\"that gunfire and insecurity have fully ceased. The embassy recommends that all U.S. citizens exercise extra caution at all times. The U.S. Embassy will continue to closely monitor the security environment in South Sudan, with particular attention to Juba city and its immediate surroundings, and will advise US citizens further if the security situation changes.\\" The embassy's Twitter account reported that it denied rumours Machar had taken refuge at the base and also reiterated warnings for its citizens to \\"remain calm.\\" On 18 December, the U.S. embassy asked all its citizens to \\"depart immediately.\\" President Barack Obama then called for an end to the fighting amid warning of being at the \\"precipice\\" of civil war. This followed his 18 December statement that he had deployed 45 troops to the country to protect U.S. personnel and interests while warning that \\"recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past. Fighting to settle political scores or to destabilise the government must stop immediately. Inflammatory rhetoric and targeted violence must cease. All sides must listen to the wise counsel of their neighbours, commit to dialogue and take immediate steps to urge calm and support reconciliation. South Sudan's leaders must recognise that compromise with one's political enemy is difficult; but recovering from unchecked violence and unleashed hatred will prove much harder.\\" He also condemned the coup. After the evacuation of some citizens from the country, in accordance with the War Powers Act, Obama wrote to Speaker John Boehner and Senate President Pro- Tempore Patrick J. Leahy that he was ready to take more action to support U.S. interests and citizens there. The country's envoy to South Sudan, Donald Booth, said prior to 25 December that \\"we notice that the African Union has said there is Christmas season upon us, and called for all parties to cease hostilities. We support that call.\\" Secretary of State John Kerry called on both parties to \\"accept a cessation of hostilities and begin mediated political talks. At the same time, U.S. Defense Department's Africom announced the deployment of a \\"platoon-sized\\" USMC contingent to neighbouring Uganda in order to protect U.S. citizens and facilities in South Sudan and to prepare for possible further evacuations. This was in addition to the nearly 100 U.S. troops in South Sudan, including the reinforcement of security at the U.S. embassy. Further, about roughly 150 USMC personnel were in Djibouti on 24 December, along with cargo planes and helicopters. Analysis Radio Tamazuj suggested resolution of the conflict as: > At minimum a process of political reconciliation must begin between Salva > Kiir, Riek Machar, Pagan Amum and their supporters. Reinstating the > opposition leaders with some of their powers either within the government or > party may be an option on the table. The worst option would be seeking a > military solution in the style of the Khartoum regime which has tried for > ten years to crush rebels in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile. War > would lead to immense suffering of the population. Perhaps the most likely > scenario is something in between, with fast spreading military clashes all > over the country, mounting pressure from the international community and > finally a painstaking national reconciliation process. > Ironically, the best bet for Salva Kiir to remain in power might indeed be > to count on the support of President Omar al-Bashir, whom he fought over > several decades. If the situation continues to run out of hand, the Nuer > militia might take control over oilfields in their homelands, which would > cut off the oil flow to Khartoum, endangering the stability of the economy > and thereby putting the regime at risk of a popular uprising. Sudan‚Äôs main > interest then is to protect the flow of oil to the north. In one scenario, > Khartoum would move to help defend the oil wells and facilities by military > means, while providing other forms of support to Salva Kiir such as air > power. In another scenario, Khartoum would divide and again rule South Sudan > by supporting its former Nuer allies like Riek Machar. Kiir's swapping of his traditional suit and cowboy hat for military fatigues was noted by commentators and analysts to be indicative of the gravity of the situation. Another noticeable and concerning event from the rebellion was the division within the presidential guards that had been internationally trained and noted for their unity despite ethnic diversity. This was read as showing strains after decades of conflict with \\"a rebel-movement turned government that is riven by infighting between former warlords vying for a piece of this oil-rich new nation\\". Kiir's televised statement also controversially made reference to Machar as determined to \\"persistently pursue his actions of the past\\", in reference to a 1991 split that led to a massacre between the Dinka and Nuer minority. It was also suggested that the spark behind the revolt was rumours of arrests after \\"a series of publci statements criticising Kiir's increasingly dictatorial style\\". South Sudanese politics has been criticised for the ethnic dominance of the Dinka tribes, being derogatively referred to as a \\"Dinkocracy\\". U.S. Ambassador to South Sudan Susan D. Page suggested that there was not as much support for Machar in an organised manner, but a general discontent over the economic and political spheres tied to a crackdown on personal freedoms that resulted in a national disunity of an identity only forged by war. The ICG's Casie Copeland said of the ethnic fighting that \\"even if there is a political deal, it will be very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle\\" and that it was concerning that UNMISS had \\"not begun patrolling in Juba and has not reached areas where civilians are concentrated.\\" Copeland added that \\"it appears both sides are fighting for their political survival. The impact of this fighting is going to shape the future of South Sudan. Parts of Juba have been reduced to rubble. Ethnic tensions have been brought into the open with devastating impact, and the political dispensation of South Sudan is going to be shaped by what's happened in the last few days.\\" The ICG later added: \\"The scenario many feared but dared not contemplate looks frighteningly possible: South Sudan, the world's newest state, is now arguably on the cusp of a civil war.\\" Jeffrey Gettleman's piece \\"Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence?\\" outlines the nuances of a prospective international intervention in the South Sudanese civil war, and highlights the competing arguments that favor or oppose such an intervention. Specifically, Gettleman tackles the question of whether South Sudan should have its sovereignty revoked and be established as a \\"trusteeship\\" run by international actors until the conflict subsides.Jeffery Gettleman. \\"Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard- Won Independence?\\" The New York Times, 01-23-2017. Retrieved 05-19-2017. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/africa/quandary-in-south-sudan- should-it-lose-its-hard-won-independence.html While African political thinkers like Mahmood Mamdani advocate for the establishment of an internationally- sanctioned and managed transitional government, Gettleman points out that the deep social cleavages of South Sudan make such an effort less feasible.Gettleman, \\"Quandary in South Sudan.\\" 01-23-2017. Retrieved 19 May 2017. Namely, he notes the tensions between the Dinka and the Nuer ethnic groups that have ordered the new rivalries at shortly after independence in 2011.Gettleman. \\"Quandary in South Sudan.\\" 01-23-2017. Retrieved 19 May 2017. However, other scholars beyond the scope of Gettleman's article have discussed the merits of either peacekeeping operations and internationally-sanctioned governing trusteeships. Virginia Page Fortna concludes that internationally- led peacekeeping operations significantly reduces the possibility that a host country will relapse into civil war.Fortna, Virginia Page. 2008. \\"Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents‚Äô Choices after Civil War.\\" Princeton: Princeton University Press. 1-179. Fortna notes that although peacekeeping may be more successful at ensuring a state's security, it does not necessarily guarantee its democratization or institutional strengthening.Fortna. \\"Does Peacekeeping Work?\\" 1-179. In contrast, however, Jeremy Weinstein contends that armed military interventions precludes the fully development of institutionally functional states.Weinstein, Jeremy M. 2005. \\"Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective.\\" Center for Global Development Working Paper 57. 1-35. Drawing on the work of Tilly, such armed campaigns prevent the process of bureaucracy-building that arises from war‚Äìnamely, the state extracting rents and building an institutional capacity to collect taxes and mobilize a large army necessary for military campaigns.Weinstein. \\"Autonomous Recovery.\\" 1-35. This should suggest that such a campaign, were it to occur in South Sudan, may be predisposed to being successful strictly in terms of maintaining peace, but not regarding building state capacity. International organizations African Union - An African Union mediation team arrived in Juba on 19 December 2013 with representatives from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. South Sudan government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said: \\"The African Union is till now meeting with the president. Their message is that they are trying to broker peace between the two forces,\\" while he added \\"Bor has surrendered actually because the forces that were in Bor were mainly loyal to Machar. They control the town but government forces are trying to retake the town.\\" Intergovernmental Authority on Development - On 27 December 2013, East African leaders gave the warring factions four days to lay down their arms, warning that IGAD will \\"take action\\" to stop the conflict in a communique issued in Nairobi. The IGAD leaders said they would not accept a violent overthrow of the country's democratically elected government, and said any change must come through the democratic process. In a statement released on 28 December, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he lauded IGAD for \\"appointing a mediation team to work with the government of south Sudan and opposition in reaching a cease-fire, the release of the detainees and building toward a process of peaceful dialogue.\\". O - The OIC's General Secretariat and office of Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu condemned the coup saying: \\"Within the framework of ensuring security and stability in the region and stressing the promotion of good-neighborliness among states of the region, especially between the Republics of the Sudan and Southern Sudan, the OIC General Secretariat condemned the attempted coup which took place yesterday morning in the Republic of Southern Sudan\\". \\\\- Secretary-General Ban's Special Representative for South Sudan Hilde Johnson issued a statement that read UNMISS was \\"deeply concerned\\" about the fighting and that \\"as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General I urge all parties in the fighting to cease hostilities immediately and exercise restraint. I have been in touch regularly with the key leaders, including at the highest levels to call for calm.\\" On 17 December, Ban spoke to Kiir calling for the government to provide an \\"offer of dialogue to its opponents and to resolve their respective differences peacefully.\\" Later, the United Nations Security Council was also told of as many as 500 deaths, 800 people injured and 20,000 seeking refuge at UN centres. French Ambassador and UNSC President for December G√©rard Araud said: \\"Fighting is on ethnic lines, which could result in a very dangerous situation\\" and the UNMIS has the authority to use force if necessary. On 22 December, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan Toby Lanzer wrote on Twitter from the UN base in Bor that over 15,000 people were sheltering there and that \\"things are changing by the hour. We are under intense pressure here, as are other locations in Jonglei. Massive setback for South Sudan.\\" On 24 December, after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressed concern about the conflict, the discovery of mass graves and the arrests of hundreds of civilians in the searches of homes and hotels, the UNSC voted to add about 6,000 international troops and 1,323 police officers to the existing over 7,600 UNMISS' personnel, including about 900 police personnel. The resolution was passed under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which authorises the use of force; at the same time the SC demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and opening a dialogue between the rival factions. The additional troops would come from other UN missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), C√¥te d'Ivoire, Liberia and neighbouring Sudan's Darfur and Abyei regions, where the latter also have an interest in South Sudan. Ban said: \\"We have reports of horrific attacks. Tens of thousands have fled their homes...innocent civilians are being targeted because of their ethnicity.\\" He also suggested targeted attacks could constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, but warned that \\"this is a political crisis which requires a peaceful, political solution.\\" The resolution also answered India's concerns, as they have over 2,000 of the 7,000 troops in the country, over the UNMISS candidate by gaining the support of France, the U.S., Russia, Guatemala and Pakistan (the latter two of which are troop contributors). India's concerns entailed responsibility for protection of civilians as part of peacekeeping operations, with India suggesting the upsurge in violence could unleash a civil war which would \\"alter the terms of reference of the presence of UNMISS [in regards to the original 2011 mandate of resolution 1996] completely;\\" India also suggested the conflicts raison d'etre as being one of intertribal or ethnic conflict, which was reflected in the first paragraph of the resolution. Both sides thus needed to agree to dialogue to resolve their differences. India's other concern was that its troops were deployed to remote areas in small numbers and are thus at the front of the \\"brunt of the violence\\" and need to be augmented. The resolutions endorsement that UNMISS has the right to take action to protect its mandate \\"gives our peacekeepers the necessary flexibility to respond to the attacks against their positions.\\" The UN reported that over 81,000 people were displaced by 25 December and up to 90,000, including 58,000 at UN facilities. On 27 December, 72 United Nations peacekeepers reportedly arrived in Juba as the first Security Council- approved additional peacekeepers, increasing the total to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. Meanwhile, U.N. officials and workers reportedly struggled to protect and provide food, shelter and medical care to internally displaced persons, of whom more than 63,000 people now crowded on to U.N. bases seeking shelter from the violence.

She was one of a class of five sister ships popularly known as \\"Lady Boats\\" that Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, England built in 1928 and 1929 for the Canadian National Steamship Company (CNS). The five vessels were Royal Mail Ships that CN operated from Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Caribbean via Bermuda. In 1942 the sank Lady Hawkins in the North Atlantic, killing 251 of the 322 people aboard. Building and peacetime service Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, on the Wirral in England built all five Lady-liners, and completed Lady Hawkins in November 1928. Lady Hawkins was an oil-burner, with a set of four Cammell Laird steam turbines driving the propeller shafts to her twin screws by single-reduction gearing. She had three passenger decks, and by 1931 she was equipped with a direction finding device. CN introduced the liners which became known as \\"Lady Boats\\" for mail, freight and passenger traffic between Canada, Bermuda and the Caribbean. The company wanted to develop Canadian exports including lumber, and imports to Canada including fruit, sugar and molasses. Each Lady-liner had refrigerated holds for perishable cargo such as fruit, and capacity for 100,000 bunches of bananas. Their hulls were painted white, which then was a relatively new fashion among shipping companies, and confined largely to passenger ships serving tropical or sub-tropical destinations. , Lady Hawkins and sailed fortnightly between Halifax and British Guiana via Boston, Bermuda, the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands and Barbados. In summer the route was extended to the Montreal. CN named each of its five new liners after the wife of an English or British admiral who was noted for his actions in the Caribbean, and who had been knighted or ennobled. Lady Hawkins was named after Katherine, the wife of the Elizabethan Admiral Sir John Hawkins (1532‚Äì95). War service and loss In January 1942 Lady Hawkins sailed from Montreal for Bermuda and the Caribbean. She called at Halifax and Boston, and by the time she left Boston she was carrying 2,908 tons of general cargo and 213 passengers as well as her complement of 107 officers, crew and DEMS gunners. At least 53 of her passengers were Royal Navy and RNVR personnel, and at least another 55 were civilians, including at least 15 from the British West Indies and four from the USA. On the morning of 19 January 1942 the ship was sailing unescorted about off Cape Hatteras, taking a zigzag course to make her more difficult to hit, when at 0743 hrs commanded by Korvettenkapit√§n Robert- Richard Zapp hit her with two stern-launched torpedoes. The liner sank in about 30 minutes. Three of her six lifeboats were damaged, but the other three were launched. One was commanded by her Chief Officer. It had capacity for 63 people but managed to embark 76 survivors. Its occupants could hear more people in the water, but could neither see them in the dark nor take them aboard the overcrowded boat if they had found them. The boat had no radio transmitter and very limited rations of drinking water, ship's biscuit and condensed milk. It shipped water and needed constant baling, but it had a mast, sail and oars and Chief Officer Percy Kelly set a course west toward the USA's Atlantic coast sea lanes and land. The boat was at sea for five days, in which time five of its occupants died. Then the survivors sighted the US Army troopship and signalled her with a flashlight. Coamos Master misread the flashes as an enemy submarine preparing to attack, and was going to continue without stopping. It was only when the survivors shone the light on the boat's sail that he correctly understood their signal. Coamo rescued the boat's 71 surviving occupants, landing them at San Juan, Puerto Rico on 28 January. Of the three lifeboats launched, only Chief Officer Kelly's was found. Including the five who died in that boat, a total of 251 people from Lady Hawkins were lost. They were the ship's master Captain Huntley Giffen, 85 other members of the crew, one DEMS gunner and 164 of her passengers, two of whom were Distressed British Seamen (i.e. survivors from previous sinkings). The 71 survivors whom Coamo rescued were Percy Kelly, 21 crew and 49 passengers. RMS Lady Drake Soon after Lady Hawkins sinking, Kelly was promoted to Captain and made Master of one of her sister ships, Lady Drake. On 5 May 1942 sank Lady Drake about north of Bermuda, killing six passengers and six crew. Kelly, 141 passengers and 113 of his crew survived and were rescued by the US Navy minesweeper , which landed them on Bermuda. Awards On 27 October 1942 two of Lady Hawkins Able Seamen, Ernest Rice and Clarence Squires, were commended in Naval citations. On 22 December 1942 Captain Kelly was awarded the MBE for his leadership in saving lives from Lady Hawkins. He was also awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea.

It and the other two, the Seward and Pioneer ditches, were built to provide water to early placer mining operations near Nome. The Miocene is the oldest and longest of the three ditches, and the highest in elevation. From suitable places along the Nome- Taylor Road the ditches form distinct parallel lines crossing tundra promontories west of the river. The ditch begins on the Nome River near the confluence with Buffalo Creek. As recently as the mid-1990s, there was a substantial head gate visible at the upper end of the ditch (Smith 1997:cover photo). There is some difference of opinion regarding the precise length of the ditch. Purington puts the length of the ditch and its laterals at 54 miles (1905:124). Four years later, the length is stated to be 62 miles (Harrison 1909:553). On the north side of King Mountain, the ditch forks, carrying water to mines in both the Snake and Nome River drainages. The upper and lower sections of the ditch were built to be 8 feet wide at the bottom and 11 feet wide at the top, while the middle section was ten feet wide at the bottom and 14 feet at the top. It was designed to carry about 28,500 gallons per minute (Purington 1905:124). Construction on the ditch began in 1901, making it the first major water conduit on the Seward Peninsula. It was conceived and built by W. L. Leland and J. M. Davidson. Major extensions in 1902 and 1903 lengthened the ditch to what appears to be its current length (Brooks 1908:29-33). In the period between 1910 and 1912 the ditch was widened using steam shovels, and two large tunnels were excavated to avoid problem areas (Daily Nome Industrial Worker 1911). Horse-drawn plows and graders, along with gangs of men constructed the ditch. Once the ditch line was surveyed, plows were used to break up the soil, then graders cast the loosened soil to the downhill side of the ditch, building a large berm. When the graders finished, men with shovels leveled the bottom of the canal and that concluded basic construction. Construction crews consisted of 60 to 70 men and between 50 and 100 horses. There were problem areas, of course, where additional construction methods had to be applied. These included areas of permafrost, rocky outcrops where stonework was necessary to support the ditch, and the need to cross several creeks tributary to Nome River. To seal the bottom of the canal through permafrost and rocky locations, clay was hauled in small boats and dumped into the ditch. Originally, two inverted syphons were constructed to cross Manila and Dorothy creeks (Purington 1905:123-126). Water from the Miocene Ditch was crucial for mining placer gold deposits in important creeks near Nome. It was used on Anvil Creek, in the Snake River drainage, and on Dexter Creek, a tributary of the Nome River. At least in the early years, mining on Dexter Creek was highly dependent on this water (Nome Nugget 1902; Nome News 1903). In general, the working season of the ditch was from late June to early to mid-October (Henshaw 1908:279). Considerable work was required to get the ditch ready each season, and a small force maintained the ditch during the operating season (Purington 1905:126). In 1987 the company that held the Miocene Ditch right-of-way across federal lands applied to relinquish the right-of-way. In response to this, the federal Bureau of Land Management conducted historical research and on-the-ground inventory of the Miocene Ditch and other water conduits in the area, and in 1990 the Miocene Ditch was determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.The Miocene Ditch.

Two days later, authorities discovered Karyn's dismembered remains, wrapped in plastic bags, in and near Lake Shelbyville. In 2002, Karyn's ex-husband, Michael Slover Jr., his mother Jeannette Slover, and his father Michael Slover Sr. were convicted of Karyn Slover's murder and all three were sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is notable for being one of the first instances of dog DNA used as evidence in a murder trial. Disappearance and search At 5:00 p.m. on September 27, 1996, Karyn left her job in the advertising sales department of the Decatur Herald & Review newspaper, with the intent to pick up her son Kolten and then shop for a dress at the Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, Illinois. Later that night a black Pontiac Bonneville was discovered in central Illinois on westbound I-72 with its engine still running, its headlights on, and the driver's side door open. The car was registered to David Swann, Karyn's boyfriend, but contained some of Karyn's personal effects including her purse and driver's license. At this time it was theorized that Karyn could have been the victim of a car-jacking, as investigators did not view her as likely to have voluntarily left the area due to her recently signing with a modeling agency for a job. On October 1, 1996 the remains of an unidentified female body were discovered in Lake Shelbyville, wrapped in plastic bags that were weighed down with concrete blocks. The remains were confirmed to be those of Karyn through her dental records and physical evidence such as a blood droplet and fingerprint were recovered from a bridge that overlooked the lake. Murder investigation Karyn's autopsy revealed that she had been shot seven times in the head and dismembered using a power saw before being placed into the plastic bags that were sealed using duct tape. Police found several strands of dog hair on the duct tape and remnants of cinders and tall grass. David Swann was an early suspect because of an imperfect alibi. Investigators were also suspicious of several actions that Swann had performed during the initial search for Karyn and because he owned a handgun matching the type that had been used to shoot her. Swann participated with police during a search and was eventually cleared of suspicion after footage from an ATM surveillance video cleared him for the missing 40 minutes of his alibi. Alibis for other suspects such as Michael Jr. and Karyn's ex- boyfriend also ruled them out as suspects. A break in the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken concrete at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr., were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist was brought in to see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found at the scene of the crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from the Slovers' business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet that matched Paris Club jeans and a button that matched to a white shirt, both of which Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property. Police then began to suspect that Michael Slover Sr. and his wife Jeannette had committed the murder over custody issues, as Karyn had expressed interest in moving away to pursue her modelling career and intended take her son Kolten with her without the father's permission, thus denying him equal parenting rights, while still collecting child support payments. Before arresting the Slovers the investigators had a veterinary geneticist perform a DNA analysis on the animal hairs found on the duct tape, which was matched to hairs retrieved from an animal brush that had been used on the dogs Slover kept on his business property. The police used this evidence to arrest the Slovers. It was later thrown out due to a court appeal by the Slovers. In January 2000, Michael and Jeannette Slover and their son Michael Slover Jr. were arrested and charged with first degree murder; Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. were each given the additional charge of attempting to conceal a crime. Michael Jr. had been confirmed to be at work but he had repeatedly called his parents that day, which made him a suspect in concealing the crime. Trial On May 18, 2002, the three Slovers were all found guilty of first-degree murder and were later sentenced to 60 years in prison, with both Michael Jr. and his father receiving an extra five years for the charge of concealing a crime. Custody battle The following year in August 2003, there were concerns raised over the custody of Karyn's son Kolten, who had been adopted by Mary Slover, Karyn's former sister-in-law. Authorities argued that Mary had been aware of the murder and could have potentially helped in concealing the crime. A judge later ruled that Mary was unfit as an adoptive parent and that she should not retain custody. Mary contested the ruling, which she claimed influenced a case worker to change her report, which initially contained a recommendation that Kolten be returned to Mary. Despite this, Mary Slover officially lost custody of Kolten in October 2003. Kolten was later raised by his maternal grandparents, Larry and Donna Hearn, of Mt. Zion, Illinois. Appeal The Slovers appealed their murder sentences, stating that media coverage preceding the trial had tainted the potential jury pool and prevented them from receiving a fair trial. Concerns were also raised about other elements such as the animal DNA testing, as well as evidence that the murder could have been committed by one of several alternative suspects. A judge ruled against opening a second trial for the Slovers, stating that he found no evidence of misconduct or prejudice. Illinois Innocence Project The Illinois Innocence Project expressed interest in the Slovers, and conducted an investigation into the case. The group circulated a petition to have the Slovers' case re-examined as well as examining evidence to find potential proof that the Slovers did not commit Karyn's murder. The group requested that the fingerprint found at the Lake Shelbyville bridge be tested as evidence, but the move was rejected in 2010 by Associate Judge Timothy Steadman, who stated: \\"Because the latent print is not suitable for the requested testing, there is no potential to produce new evidence materially relevant to the defendants' assertion of actual innocence\\". Media The murder and the subsequent investigation have been the focus of several episodes of investigative true crime shows. The case was examined in a 2006 episode of the truTV television series Forensic Files, the 2005 premiere episode of the Discovery Channel series Guilty or Innocent? and a 2010 episode of the Investigation Discovery show Cold Blood. The case was also featured in an episode of Medical Detectives.

Biography  Henri IV and La Belle Fosseuse after a painting by Antony Paul Emile Morlon Fran√ßoise de Montmorency-Fosseux was the youngest of five daughters born to Pierre I de Montmorency. At age thirteen, she became lady-in-waiting to Queen Margaret of Valois. A shy and blushing girl, she caught the attentions of King Henry. He called her \\"ma fille\\" and plied her with cakes, pastries, and rosewater sweets. She finally gave in to his advances during a voyage to Montauban, and afterwards grew ambitious and arrogant towards Queen Margaret, carrying on the affair in hopes of marriage. She eventually became pregnant, and with the prospect of bearing the child of a king, came to consider herself queen. Wary of gossip, however, she and Henry fled court at N√©rac for Eaux-Chaudes from 7 to 25 June 1581. Henry wanted Queen Margaret to travel with them, but she waited to join the two at Bagn√®res de Bigorre. Margaret proposed banishing her rival from court, but La Fosseuse screamed that she would refuse to cooperate. Fran√ßoise finally gave birth to a daughter, but the child was stillborn. The doctor informed Henry, and Margaret made sure the lying-in proceeded as discreetly as possible by acting as midwife. Margaret was then invited by her mother Catherine de' Medici to Paris, along with her ladies-in-waiting, including Fran√ßoise. Catherine advised her daughter to return Fran√ßoise to her own parents. Following this counsel, Margaret chased La Fosseuse from court in 1582. Henry took this as a personal insult, but did nothing to retaliate, as he had then fallen to the charms of \\"the beautiful Corisande,\\" Diane d'Andoins. On 11 March 1596, Fran√ßoise de Montmorency-Fosseux married Fran√ßois de Broc, Baron of Cinq-Mars. At her death in 1614, she was buried in the church at Broc.

The National Museum in New Delhi, India, has two galleries of decorative arts with a large collection of Mughal jade carvings forming a display for its Jade Collection. Mughal jade Mughal jades, apart from contemporary architectural embellishment, was the primary form of sculptural expression in northern India during the 17th to 19th centuries. The museum has several immaculately carved jade artefacts studded with jewels. Fashioning jade to exquisite art-forms is a highly skilled but difficult and slow process. It is not carved but abraded with the help of several abrasives harder than jade. Finished jade objects were often damascened with gold or silver, enamelled or studded with jewels, not only for external beauty but also to grant them royal status. Decorative elements and design used in Mughal architecture in stone and marble were beautifully used in jade. Jade formed an important material with which small objects like thumb rings, wine cups, plates, trays, boxes, huqqa bowls, dagger and sword hilts and the like were fashioned and decoratively enriched with various designs. The Mughals referred to jade by its Persian name Yashm. They had workshop and factories where these artistic objects were manufactured in a refined style and encouraged artists-craftsman and artisans to come to their courts to receive honours and grants. The imperial workshops were maintained as part of the emperor's household. Abul Fazal describes the imperial household containing \\"one hundred workshops, each resembling a city or rather a little kingdom\\". Abul Fazal further describes that administrative supervision of workshops was held by the \\"High Steward of the Imperial staff\\". For each variety of handicrafts there were separate departments which were not only supervised by master craftsman but sometimes the emperor himself. They had a rich literary tradition and during the course of the expansion of their rule they came in contact with different traditions of other people and places. This was aesthetically synthesized into collective culture. History Unworked jade. Jade is a gemstone with unique symbolic energy is known for its glossy surface, hardness and translucency. The term jade is commonly used to cover the nephrite, jadeite and chloromelanite groups of minerals, all of which are hard and attractively coloured. Bowenite is called False Jade or Jade look alike and is softer than true jade. Jade comes in attractive colours ranging across dark green, pale green, white and yellow. This precious stone mainly comes from the rivers Karakash and Yarkand in Kwen- Lun range and Kashgar, in southern and northern China, besides upper Myanmar and Tibet. A variety of jade jewellery and utility objects was used by Islamic rulers such Timurids, Ottomans of Turkey, Safavids of Persia and Mughals of India. Jade became popular in India only from Akbar's time (16th century), although green jadite beads were found at Mohen-jo-daor and Hiuen-Tsang's travel accounts also mention the use of jade in India. An English Sea Captain, Howkins, who visited Jahangir's court in 1613 found five hundred cups made of rubies, emeralds, jade and other semi-precious stones. The choicest carved and jewel studded jade armoury, jewellery and luxury items have been arranged here, to reflect the richness of Jade carving tradition of India. A few Chinese artefacts on display are good examples of ritual implements and sculptures. Mughal artefacts Emperor Jahangir's Inscribed Huqqa. =Huqqa of Emperor Jahangir= Tobacco smoking was introduced in India by the Portuguese during Emperor Akbar's period (1526‚Äì1605). In spite of Akbar's effort to ban smoking, it became popular during his son Jahangir's reign (1605‚Äì1628). The smoking of tobacco through a water base was believed to be less harmful. Huqqa or Hookah, a Persian word, usually has four parts; huqqa base is the water container; hollow stem, which is divided into two tubes to connect the huqqa base with chilam (tobacco container) and smoking pipe is placed on the neck of huqqa base. The third portion is the chilam with detachable lid to place it on top of one of the hallow tube. The last piece is a smoking tube, which is attached to the tip of the second tube. An interesting practice regarding the Muhnal (mouth-piece) is that it was detachable enabling each user to use his own muhnal. Artisans were inspired by the popularity of Huqqa smoking and created many innovatively shaped huqqas ‚Äì ovoid, spherical, curvaceous and bell shaped, or in the shape of mango, bird or doll. These huqqas were made of glass with gold and jewel studded decoration, silver enamelled or jade carved. The highly ornamental silver and jade huqqas are often found in many museums collection around the globe. This inscribed jade narval shaped huqqa is a very rare piece. Calligraphy is inscribed on silver strip, which has been elegantly fixed on the chilam and pedestal. The upper edge and lower portion of chilam and upper portion of huqqa's pedestal is inscribed in Arabic and Persian in Nastaliq script. The inscription reads: The English translation thus reads: The inscription on the top of the huqqa reads: This roughly translates to: This Hijri year converts to 1626 AD.

Akbar and his successors continued and upgraded this system and under their personal supervision exquistive jewellery items, imaginative armoury articles and a variety of utilitarian artefacts were crafted. Immacutavely carved out of jade these artefacts are often studded with jewels like rubies, diamonds, emeralds and jade. These objects are great examples of the emperor's high taste and the skill of the artisans. Among various uttarian artefacts, the surahi (flask), which was used for keeping wine or water, is a rare example of jade carving. Many vessels are illustrated in the Persian and Indian miniature paintings of the seventeenth-eighteenth century. With a globular body and long neck, this surahi is an outstanding example of jade carving. It is inlaid with diamond shaped jade pieces and decorated with gold wire. Each of the joints is beautifully decorated with six petal flower motifs, which have been worked with gold leaf covering and glass. The neck portion of surahi is made of small rectangular jade pieces on which row of diamond design has been worked out. A ring of red stones on the lower portion of neck enhanced the charm of the surahi. =Cup of Emperor Akbar Shah II= Jade bowl inscribed with Akbar II's name Cups and vases made under supervision were immaculately carved out of jade and often studded with jewels. Among all the exquisite examples, the most unusual object displayed in the jade utility section is the cup, on which the name of the Mughal Emperor Akbar II Shah (1760‚Äì1837) is inscribed in Persian. The inscription reads 'Shah Akbar'. He was the second son of Shah Alam II and the father of Bahadur Shah Zafar II. Light green cups which can be seen in Mughal paintings which might be interpreted as being East Asian green celadon ware. However, no such celadons have yet been discovered in a Mughal context. Floral motifs were beautifully used in stylised and realistic manner. Some of the flowers identified as Iris and Narcissus. The many flowers on the plant are seen from different angles and in different stages of their blossoming. =Archer's rings= Archer's rings Specially designed 'archer's ring' was worn by an archer in the thumb of the right or left hand at the time of archery. While pulling the string for shooting the arrow, it helped in safe guarding the thumb, so that the string of bow would not damage the fingers. It is made of whitish nephrite jade and dark green jade. It is adorned by floral motifs. =Other items= Other objects include studded plated, betel and spice boxes, cups, bowls, spoon, plaques, tumblers etc. All these artefacts help in understanding the artistic taste of patrons and craftsmanship of artisans prevalent during the 17‚Äì19th Century CE. An ornate jade armlet of 18th century is inlaid with ruby in the center and surrounded by emeralds. An 18th century jade cosmetic casket is in the shape of the mango with an enamelled silver lid. A plate of the 18th century is inlaid with precious stones and gold wires.

Life A prosperous pewterer in London, he was the son of Alexander Cleeve, pewterer in Cornhill, who died on 11 April 1738. He was given the freedom of the City of London in 1736, at the age of 21. In 1755 Cleeve paid a fine to be excused serving the office of sheriff of London. Foots Cray Place, 1760 engraving by William Woollett Around that date Cleeve acquired an estate in Foots Cray, Kent, once the property of Sir Francis Walsingham. He pulled down the old house, and erected, at some distance north of it, a Palladian mansion of freestone. He enclosed a park round it, with plantations of trees, and an artificial canal. This house was known as Foots Cray Place. It has been attributed to the architect Isaac Ware, on the basis of a 19th-century listing; Howard Colvin regards the attribution as \\"acceptable\\" on style ground, but there is no direct evidence. The house was damaged by fire in 1949, and demolished. Cleeve also acquired much other land in Kent before his death on 1 March 1760. Works Cleeve wrote A Scheme for preventing a further Increase of the National Debt, and for reducing the same (1756), inscribed to the Earl of Chesterfield (1756). The scheme was to impose a high tax on houses, and to repeal an equivalent amount of taxes on \\"commodities\\". Part of this tract was taken up with estimates of the amount subtracted in taxes from incomes. Cleeve's estimates were exaggerated, as was shown by Joseph Massie's Letter to Bourchier Cleeve, Esq., concerning his Calculations of Taxes (1757). He wrote another pamphlet, on the staffing of the navy. Family Cleeve married Mary Haydon in 1740 or 1741. Mary gave birth to three children: * Richard Haydon Cleeve christened at St Michael, Cornhill 1743-12-14 * Ann Cleeve christened at St Alfege Church, Greenwich 1745-07-17 * Bourchier Cleeve christened at St Michael, Cornhill, 1746-11-26 His will was made in 1759 and only mentions Ann. Bourchier died at Foots Cray Place on 1760-03-01, having last modified his will two days earlier. It's not clear when Mary died, but Ann eventually inherited the estates, which in 1765 came into the possession of Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet, by his marriage with her. Wealth The source of Cleeve's enormous wealth is not at all clear. He bought the manor of Limpsfield in Surrey on 1750-12-28 for ¬£15800. This included over 1000 acres of farms and 900 acres of woodland. He planned to raise over ¬£15000 profit by felling and selling for timber 6200 oak trees from this land as part of Ann's dowry, which would still have left him with the freeholds and rents. He bought the estate which was to become Foots Cray Place for ¬£5450 in 1752. He built his grand new house, and after his death the estate was sold for ¬£14500. He thought that his widow would easily find ¬£5000 to add to his daughter's dowry. He specified that his art collection was not to be sold for less than ¬£7350. As well as his main house at Foots Cray Place, he also owned * the manor of Limpsfield * a town house he used himself at Spring Garden, Charing Cross * Land in Farningham, Eynsford, North Cray, Bexley, Chislehurst and Sidcup, Kent * Property in Cornhill Notes ;Attribution Category:1760 deaths Category:English businesspeople Category:English economics writers Category:English landowners Category:Bourchier family Category:Pewterers Category:1715 births ","title":"Bourchier Cleeve"},{"id":"41545849","text":"Siege of Antwerp may refer to: * Siege of Antwerp (1584‚Äì1585), conducted by Spanish forces against a Dutch garrison during the Eighty Years' War * Siege of Antwerp (1814), conducted by Allied forces against a French garrison during the Napoleonic Wars * Siege of Antwerp (1832), conducted by French forces against a Dutch garrison after the Ten Days' Campaign * Siege of Antwerp (1914), conducted by German forces against a Belgian and British garrison during World War I See also * The Sack of Antwerp (1576) * Battle of Belgium, a 1940 battle conducted by German forces against a Belgian garrison during World War II * Battle of the Scheldt, a 1944 battle conducted by Allied forces against a German garrison during World War II ","title":"Siege of Antwerp"},{"id":"41545864","text":"Plaka () is a settlement of the Dio-Olympos municipality.

The potato-based flavoured snack took their name from the characteristic shape of the crisps. Peaking in popularity during the 1970s, Toobs were considered a novelty crisp and could be found in supermarkets and selected convenience stores. They were available in a number of flavours including Chicken, Oriental, Oats and Mexican Party, but more recently were only available in the original tomato flavour. Production ceased in 2001, but resumed in 2007 with the new name \\"Tasty Toobs\\", and the Herald Sun attributed a resurgence in popularity of the flavoursome rings and Samboy potato chips to the global economic recession. The product gained some media attention when its Wikipedia page was vandalized in 2014. The Smith's Snackfood Company ceased production of Toobs in 2015 due to poor consumer demand. On 27 October 2015, as bags of Tasty Toobs became scarce, Melbourne radio duo Lucy and Kel announced on air they would give away their last bags of Tasty Toobs to a listener. Campaign to Bring Back Toobs After the announcement of the discontinuation of Toobs in 2015, there was public outcry. Cricketer Shane Warne attempted to start a campaign on Twitter to bring back Toobs using hashtags #BringBackToobs and #savetoobs.

The site is built and maintained by a small group of radio amateurs with interests in SOTA,http://www.sotamaps.org/about.php hill walking and mountaineering, mapping and open source programming. They also maintainhttp://www.iotamaps.org/about.php a similar site (www.iotamaps.org) for the Islands on the air (IOTA) award scheme. Features The site has five main mapping pages, each providing different sets of functionality. =Main page= This is the page most often used, since it is referenced directly by links from each of the SOTAWatch Summit pages. In addition to being able to view various SOTA Associations, Regions and individual summits, the page offers the exporting or downloading of such data in GPX (for import into a GPS device) or KML (for importing into Google Earth) formats. =Range page= The Range page provides tools with which the user can perform various distance- measurement tasks. The most often used of these is the \\"range\\" facility itself, which will find summits within a certain distance of some reference point. The user can input a central location in one of several forms - latitude/longitude, Maidenhead (\\"Grid\\") Locator, or an address or place-name - and can then choose one of three range-types within which the summits should be found: * closed circle: summits within the entire circle will be found; * open circle: by entering two different distances representing the radii of two concentric circles, summits will be found within the annulus formed by the two circles; * road-route: the user enters a search radius, and defines the start- and end-positions of a route; then, by choosing one of possibly several routes found between those points, all summits within a corridor of width equal to the search-radius along the length of the route will be found. All summits so found will be presented in a list and also on the map. Export of data for the summits found is also provided. =Tracks page= The Tracks Page allows the user to view, draw, or upload tracks or walking routes leading to SOTA summits. The three main sets of options are: * View user-defined tracks on map - view tracks generated by users of the system. * Draw track on map - using custom drawing tools, the user can draw a favourite track leading to a SOTA summit. * Import track from file - the user can import a track (in GPX format) to a SOTA summit which he/she has recorded with a GPS unit. Export of tracks data for the summits is also provided. =Alerts page= Presents the latest SOTAWatch Alerts \\\\- data are refreshed once every minute. Each Alert as it arrives is presented in the listview on the right-hand side of the main map. =Spots page= Presents the latest SOTAWatch Spots \\\\- data are refreshed once every minute. Each Spot as it arrives is presented in the listview on the right-hand side of the main map. Clicking on an entry in the list will cause the map to navigate to the summit mentioned in the Spot and an information window will open, listing all Spots reported for that summit within the time- frame of the query.  Mapping tools Each of the five mapping pages, in addition to their specific functionality, also feature a set of map tools common to all. These are situated at the top of the map area in each of the mapping pages. * Position - shows latitude/longitude and Maidenhead Locator at the mouse-pointer; also features a full dynamic Locator grid, showing greater detail as the user zooms into the map; * Open Maps - allows the user to choose in addition to, and as replacements for, the standard mapping styles from Google Maps, one of two extra mapping styles provided by the open source mapping community: Open Street Map, or Open Cycle Map Normal. * Day/Night - shows day/night shading and sunrise/sunset terminator superimposed on the mapping area. This is experimental, and results cannot be 100% guaranteed, but give nonetheless a very good approximation of the sun/terminator position.

Linking the cities of Shenzhen and Zhanjiang, it will also allow for future high speed train travel between Hong Kong and Hainan Island. History Announced as part of the 12th Five Year Plan for 2011‚Äì2016, it was projected that construction of this railway would begin. Tenders were called for early in 2013 with construction to begin before the end of that year. Construction officially began on 28 June 2014. The railway of Jiangmen‚ÄìMaoming section is entered to operation on July 1, 2018. Route The railway is to follow a route from Shenzhen North railway station to Maoming East railway station. The existing Xinhui branch of the Guangzhou‚ÄìZhuhai Intercity Railway will be included as a central link, with of new trackage extending west to Maoming and then a new tunnel across the Pearl River Delta from Shenzhen south of the Humen Bridge. Starting at Shenzhen North, the railway will travel through a tunnel to Airport North at Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport. It will then cross through a tunnel underneath the Pearl River before reaching Xiaolan, Guzhen, Waihai, Jiangmen South, Shuangshui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Dahuai, Heshan, Yangjiang, Yangxi, Mata, Guanzhu,Dianbai and Maoming East. Construction The Maoming‚ÄìZhanjiang section was constructed between 2009 and 2013. The project was funded jointly by the, now defunct, Ministry of Railways and the Guangdong Provincial Government. Construction commenced on March 21, 2009 and was opened to traffic on December 28, 2013. Although officially opened on December 28, 2013, no high-speed trains started using it at the time. Construction of the 387-km Shenzhen‚ÄìMaoming railway was carried out in two phases: (1) the Jiangmen‚ÄìMaoming section and (2) the Shenzhen‚ÄìJiangmen section. Phase one from Jiangmen to Maoming started in June 2014 and was opened on July 1, 2018. From this point on, thru high-speed service started along the Guangzhou‚ÄìJiangmen‚ÄìMaoming‚ÄìZhanjiang route. A special feature of Phase 1 is a 2,036-meter steel tunnel protecting the Birds' Paradise from the noise of the high speed line. The noise barrier reduces the noise of the train to about 50 dB SPL at the bird park, which is only 800 meters away from the high-speed line. Phase two from Shenzhen to Jiangmen was delayed due to the complicated geographic condition of the mouth of the Pearl River and the large budget, 65.2 billion yuan (US$9.88 billion). Construction of phase two is expected to begin 2018.

(Starting from mid April 2016). Built in 2001 as Superfast VI by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in Kiel, Germany for Attica Group's subsidiary Superfast Ferries, she was sold to the Genting Group in 2013, Renamed Bimini Superfast for the Bimini-Miami route. In 2016 she was sold to her current owners. Concept and construction Superfast VI was built at HDW in Kiel for Superfast Ferries' Adriatic Sea services, along with her sister ship Superfast V. She was the second ship in the third pair of ropax ferries built for Superfast Ferries from various ship yards in Northern Europe. She was ordered in July 1998, alongside sister ship and another pair for Baltic sea services, Superfast VII and VIII She was launched from dry dock on 11 March 2000 and was due to be delivered at the end of July 2000, but after many months of delays due to technical problems, she was delivered to Superfast Ferries on 6 February 2001. After many months of delays due to technical problems, Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) was forced to pay hefty penalties due to the late delivery. Service history=2001-2013: Superfast VI= Superfast VI in Patras, Greece in August 2009 Superfast VI entered service on 2 March 2001 on Superfast Ferries Patras‚ÄîIgoumenitsa-Ancona route. In March 2013 Superfast VI was sold to Genting Group, she was handed over to her new owners on 6 April 2013. = 2013-2016: Bimini Superfast = After Genting Group took over their new ship, she was renamed Bimini Superfast. She departed Patras and sailed to M√°laga in Spain for remodeling. After a few weeks she departed M√°laga and sailed to USA for final fitting out works to be completed. Bimini Superfast was due to begin service with the Bimini cruise from Miami on 6 June 2013 but the US Coast Guard did not give approval for the ship to sail in US waters. This was due to deficiencies with the crew and the ship, even though it had been sailing in Europe for many years with no compliance issues. After several weeks of work, the US Coast Guard gave Bimini Superfast final clearance to sail. On 20 June 2013 she finally made her first crossing from Miami to Bimini. Bimini Superfast operated 2 and 3 night cruises from Miami. They depart Miami at 7PM, spend 2 or 3 nights at Bimini and returns to Miami at 1PM on the third or fourth day. Passengers are required to have passports if staying on the Island but this is not required if lodging on the ship. The 50 mile trip to Bimini Island takes about 3 hours. With the completion of the pier in Bimini Bay as of 18 September 2014 passengers are no longer tendered by ferry from the ship to the island. Passengers disembark directly on the island from the cruise ship, saving about 60 minutes of ferry time each way. Once in Bimini, passengers disembark to visit Resorts World Bimini Bay Resort and Casino via a free tram. Part of the business plan of Genting for the Bimini Superfast was to carry out evening gambling and party cruises to nowhere, but due to visa issues with the hotel staff being foreign nationals, the US government has ruled that they can no longer offer these cruises, as the passengers never set foot in another country. As a consequence Bimini Superfast completed her last cruise to nowhere on 28 November 2013. However the Bimini Superfast ceased operating on 10 January 2016 after only 3 years of operation. Genting announced in January 2016 of its plans to cease the service from Florida to Bimini,it was sold to Grimaldi Lines of Italy. =2016-Onwards: Cruise Olbia= In January Grimaldi Lines announced the purchase of the Bimini Superfast, to be placed on Livorno- Olbia route, replacing the Zeus Palace, which will be placed on the Civitavecchia-Olbia route.

It was from India that it spread to the rest of the world. It was a very popular game that was played not only for entertainment but also as a way to instruct on morality. The central concept of the game is the liberation from bondage of passions. So the players move from the lower levels of consciousness to higher levels of spiritual enlightenment and finally to Moksha.Topsfield (2006):13 Board geometry The Gyan Chauper board is in a grid pattern. The Hindu Gyan Chauper has numerous formats whereas the Jain Gyan Chaupers are standardized with 84 numbered squares in a 9x9 pattern. The board game is in the human shape-the universal being. The top most part of the board is the heavenly abode or the Moksha dwar akin to the head of the cosmic being. A protruding square on the extreme bottom left and one square on each side of the board is indicative of its legs and arms. Even the way the snakes and ladders have been placed on the board does not change whereas they vary widely in Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist Gyan Chaupers.Topsfield (2006):79 History Dice games have been played in India since Vedic times, though game boards and pieces have been found in the Indus Valley Civilisation. Ivory and bone objects of all shapes and sizes, some with dots on them, and interpreted as \\"dice\\" and/or \\"gaming pieces\\", have been found at Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal, Kalibangan, Alamgirpur, and so on. Fragments of game boards have also been found at various sites. A potsherd with a chaupar design drawn on it has been discovered at Nagarjunakonda. A recent excavation from Rakhigarhi in Haryana discovered game boards and game pieces in terracotta and stoneAmarendra Nath, ‚ÄúRakhigarhi, a Harappan metropolis in the Sarasvati Drishadvati divide‚Äù, Puratattva, 28, 1998.. Many pyramid-shaped game pieces made in stone, ivory and terracotta have been discovered at these ancient sites.Arundhati (2004):1-2 Dice playing is also mentioned in a hymn in the Rig Veda, which expresses the lament of the player over his loss of wealth and spouse. The Vedic people used Vibhidaka (small brown nuts) as dice. This tradition of ritualistic gambling is still seen today as Hindus play the modern version of this game during Diwali.Topsfield (2006):14 The Mahabharata also mentions the game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses everything to his cousins.Topsfield (2006):18 The Skanda Purana mentions Shiva and Parvati playing a game of dice. This scene has been beautifully shown in a sculpture in the Ellora Caves in Aurangabad.Topsfield (2006):13 The Jain gyan chauper is mentioned in the Dhanapala, a 10th-century text from Rishabhapanchashika. It was mostly played on painted cloth called patas. Gyan Chauper reached England around 1890s. In the beginning the game was also moralistic like the Indian version, but later due to the slowdown of the European economy in the 1940s due to the wars only numerical plan game boards were made. This design since then has remained ubiquitous. Gameplay Gyan chauper influenced the creation of morality games such as \\"Virtue Rewarded and Vice Punished\\" (1918) which evolved during the British Raj into the English game of Snakes and Ladders.Topsfield (2006):87 Its played with the same rules except here the idea behind it is how an individual's karma effects his spiritual journey. Therefore, each player the jiva progresses upwards overcoming hurdles in the form of snakes representing vices. Each player starts from the bottom Narak Dwar and takes turns to roll dice and moves forward according to the number generated, towards Swarg (heaven) & ultimately reaching their goal of uniting with the Supreme One, seen as a crescent shape right on top. Specific versions right The Hindu version of the Gyan Chauper was more popular with the Brahmins. Traditional Hindu gyan chaupars boards have greater diversity in terms of the format than those of Jains. These formats are supposed to have developed over a period of time. The terminologies included on the board are Sankhya, Yoga, Vedanta, all underlining devotionalism. Vaikuntha (the heaven of Vishnu) being the winning square in most of the Hindu boards point to the fact that these boards were mostly Vaishnava in inspiration. Some of the Hindu boards following the 9√ó8 pattern, i.e., 72 squares in all, are found in Nepal as well where it is referred to as nagapasa or snake-dice. Surprisingly, both Persian and Devanagari script have been used in the squares.Topsfield (2006):79 In one of the board games of early 19th-century from Marwar, Vishnu is shown in the form of Krishna. There is also a unique example of a 124-square board from Maharashtra. Another notable feature of this board is the unusual 14√ó10 grid, the whole playing area being divided into four separate zones.Topsfield (2006):82 The Muslim version was used in the Mughal period from the late 17th or early 18th century. It is 100 square gyan chauper which represents the number of names of god or 101, if the throne of Allah is counted. It is written in Arabic or Persian. There are 17 ladders and 13 snakes. It shows direct ladders from fana fi Allah to the throne. Later with slight modifications, it is known as \\"Shatranj-al-Arifin\\" or \\"The chess of gnostics.Topsfield(2006):85-86 The Gyan Chauper exhibited at the National Museum, New Delhi is the Jain version with 84 squares.

He was also associated with Indian Council of Social Science Research, International Foundation for Development Alternatives, and People's Union for Civil Liberties. One of the great political thinkers of the 20th- century, amongst his noted works include Politics in India (1970), Caste in Indian Politics (1973), and Rethinking Democracy (2005). In 1985, Lokayan was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"linking and strengthening local groups working to protect civil liberties, women's rights and the environment.\\" Early life and background Kothari was the only son of his father, a Jain trader. His mother died early in life. Career Kothari started his career as a lecturer at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (Baroda University). While working here he first received recognition in 1961, when his essays series, \\"Form and Substance in Indian Politics\\" were published in the Economic and Political Weekly (then Economic Weekly) over six issues. He had also started writing for Seminar, the journal published by Romesh Thapar. Thereafter he was invited by Professor Shyama Charan Dube to become the Assistant Director of the National Institute of Community Development, Mussoorie. In 1963, he moved to Delhi, where using a personal grant of Rs. 70,000 given by Professor Richard L. Park, head of Asia Foundation‚Äôs India chapter, he started the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), in the premises of the Indian Adult Education Association at Indraprastha Estate, Delhi, before moving to its present location in Civil Lines, Delhi. Here working along with Ashis Nandy, D.L. Sheth, Ramashray Roy, Bashiruddin Ahmed and others, pioneering works in social sciences were published over next two decades.

Thereafter he published noted works like Caste in Indian Politics (1973) and Footsteps into the Future (1975). During the early 1970s, he was associated with Congress- leader Indira Gandhi, and negotiated with the Congress-led central government for Navnirman movement, a socio-political movement of 1974 against corruption in Gujarat, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the state government. However, with the entry of Sanjay Gandhi, he distanced himself from Congress, and came close to Jaya Prakash Narayan and the Janata Party instead. After the Emergency of 1975, he moved away from political parties, and started his career as an activist.

History Axeltorv was inaugurated on 8 November 1917. The grounds were formerly part of Farigmagsvej and used as a plaza in front of the main entrance to Copenhagen's second Central Station which had been built in 1864. The site had for decades been dominated by National Scala, an entertainment venue situated on the eastern corner of the street. On the opposite corner was a small round pavilion, Centralpavilionen, which sold lottery tickets. The square was established when the street was moved to its current location in connection with the opening of the Boulevard Line. It takes its name after Bishop Absalon, Copenhagen's founder, whose (little used) Danish name was Axel. Notable buildings and residents Axelborg was completed in 1920. Originally a bank headquarters, it now houses the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. The Circus Building is from 1886. The Palads Cinema opened in the former central station in 1912 but its current building is from 1917. The former Copenhagen Waterworks, built on a site between the Boulevard Line and Studiestr√¶de, though barely visible from the square, also has its address on Axeltorv (No. 12). The Scala Project The Scala Building was demolished in 2012. An office complex designed by Lundgaard & Tranberg consisting of five cylinders of varying height and interconnected by skyways, positioned on a one-storey plinth, now stands on the site. The project has also proposed a renovation of the square that will enhance Fortification Ring's character of being a \\"green belt\\"surrounding the city centre. Sculptures A 12.5 metre long water basin with nine bronze amphoras was installed in the square in 1991. It was designed by Mogens M√∏ller in collaboration with the architect Mogens Breyen and is called Zodiac. Robert Jacobsen's sculpture De Syv Aksler (1984) was installed in front of the Palads Cinema in 1987. It commemorates the escape of Jews from Denmark during World War II. It consists of seven abstract iron sculptures on a star-shaped, cobbled plinth. Kai Nielsen's sculpture of Ursus and the Bull was positioned on the roof of the Palads Cinema in 1917 but was not gilded until 1949.

It lies just outside Norrt√§lje in Stockholm County, Sweden. It was built by Birger Persson, father of Saint Bridget of Sweden, and it is probably the church where she was baptised. History Memorial to Saint Bridget, erected outside the church in 1930 The oldest parts of Skederid Church date from the end of the 13th century, and was built by lawspeaker Birger Persson, a man closely connected to King Birger of Sweden and the father of Saint Bridget of Sweden. The area surrounding the church is rich in cultural heritage, having been the site of continuous population since at least the Bronze Age. A runestone is immured in the church. The church was originally built as a private church belonging to Birger Persson's farmstead. The original church was very small, the size of the choir of the presently visible building, but still consciously built, displaying influences from French church building traditions. The church was ravaged by fire some time during the 14th century, and the original wooden ceiling destroyed. The young Saint Bridget had some of her earliest religious visions here. After she was proclaimed a saint in 1391, the church became a pilgrimage site. In connection with this, the church was expanded and rebuilt. By the mid-15th century it acquired the size and form it still largely has. In 1748, the former choir was turned into a vestry, and in 1880 the old vestry was demolished. The medieval gate entrance to the cemetery was transformed into a bell tower in 1775. A memorial stone dedicated to Saint Bridget was erected outside the church in 1930. Architecture The church is built of granite blocks, with some details in brick. The oldest parts of the church is the choir and vestry. A substantial enlargement of the church was carried out in the 15th century, when the present-day nave and interior vault were constructed. The church was originally decorated with frescos but only fragments remain of these. The church has housed a number of medieval furnishings, most now in the Swedish History Museum, and possibly also relics (now lost) of Saint Bridget. A wooden sculpture depicting the same saint is still displayed in the church, while a triumphal cross, a processional cross and another wooden saint, all medieval, now are on displayed in the aforementioned museum. A number of carved wooden epitaphs belonging to various aristocratic families adorn the walls of the church.

It is significant as a largely intact record of prehistoric life over a long span of time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History The site of the Platte River Campground was used sporadically over a wide span of time, estimated to be A.D. 130-1269, during Middle and Late Woodland period. Evidence suggests that this occupation was short-term, consistent with a seasonal camping site, rather than long-term. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the logging community of Edgewater was established on the shore of Platte Lake; the community overlapped the prehistoric campground. After the area was logged, the State of Michigan turned the location into a campground; the campground became part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore upon its creation in 1973. Archaeological artifacts were first discovered at the Platte River Campground site in 1985. Although an earlier survey in 1976 had covered the area, the prehistoric site at the Platte River Campground had been missed. Archaeological excavations were conducted at the site in 1987 to assess the impact of a planned campground redevelopment program. Although the site had seen constant use for over 50 years as a campground, the site maintained a high degree of integrity. Description The Platte River Campground site extends 300 meters along the north bank of the Platte River, and runs up to 160 meters deep. The site is a multicomponent site, with repeated prehistoric occupations over the Middle and Late Woodland Periods as well as historic occupation around the turn of the 20th century; thus, artifacts were found covering a range of time periods. The artifacts recovered included a great many fire cracked rocks and chert flakes. Some ceramic shard and stone projectile points were also discovered, as well as two celts and two copper artifacts. Historic artifacts, presumably related to the logging community of Edgewater, were also discovered.

It is one of Schubert's six unfinished symphonies.A new Schubert completion ‚Äì update It was begun in 1820 or 1821, with initial sketches made for the opening sections of the first, second, and fourth movements, and an almost complete sketch for the third movement. He abandoned this symphony after this initial phase of work and never returned to it, although Schubert would live for another seven years. British conductor and composer Brian Newbould, an authority on Schubert's music, has speculated that the symphony was left incomplete due to problems Schubert faced in orchestrating the sketch. In 2012, Newbould was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 to complete the symphony. He had previously completed three other unfinished symphonies by Schubert (the seventh (D 729), eighth (D 759), and tenth (D 936A). At that time he had done work to make the existing fragments of D 708A performable, but this was his first attempt to go beyond the fragments and complete the entire structure. His completed version has been subsequently performed, recorded, published, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3. History=Composition= Schubert in 1821 This sketch is the second of a series of four unfinished symphonies ‚Äì D 615, D 708A, D 729 (the seventh), and D 759 (the eighth) ‚Äì that are milestones in Schubert's symphonic development between the sixth and ninth symphonies. These four symphonies are in varying states of completion: D 615 has incomplete sketches of only two movements (the allegro and the finale), D 708A has incomplete sketches of all four movements, D 729 is structurally complete but was not fully orchestrated, and D 759 has the first two movements complete and orchestrated and a third movement in an incomplete piano sketch.Discovering Music ‚Äì The Spirit of Schubert. Interview with Brian Newbould. Previously, his fourth symphony had had some Beethovenian influence (although it is more reminiscent of the earlier Sturm und Drang movement), his fifth Mozartian influence, and his sixth Rossinian influence (Schubert had listened to Rossini's music before writing his sixth symphony and was extremely impressed, then incorporating aspects of Rossini's style into his music). After writing the sixth symphony, Schubert experienced a directional crisis in his symphonic output, as he was not sure about whether to continue on the path, as in the sixth symphony, of being influenced by Rossini. There is thus some Beethovenian influence present, which would persist throughout his symphonic output, but in D 708A Schubert starts to create his own style and explore new territory. Additionally, he was still learning how to master instrumental writing, despite having done so for vocal works some years before. His mastery of songwriting was helped by the fact that the words gave hints as to the structure he would use, help that could not come in instrumental writing. This can be seen from the fact that Schubert had written his first six symphonies directly into full orchestral score, without sketching for piano beforehand, but D 615 and D 708A only survive as sketches in piano score. He returned to writing directly into orchestral score for his seventh symphony, although piano sketches exist for the eighth. These four unfinished symphonies thus show how Schubert was, as he stated in a letter from the mid-1820s, preoccupied with \\"planning a path to [write] a grand symphony [plans he would realize in the ninth symphony]\\", with his string quartets, octet and these unfinished symphonies as intermediate steps in this plan. The unusually large number of unfinished symphonies on the way to the ninth from the sixth show how preoccupied he was with writing this great symphony, and how important this plan was to him. Schubert's reasons for abandoning D 708A probably have much to do with problems in orchestrating it. In addition to the problematic extremely high clarinet solos at points in the second and third movements, a further problem is that the climax of the fourth movement reaches A major. This key is so far away from D major that the horns, trumpets and timpani simply have no notes to play at this climax (they were then confined to notes from a single key, usually the one the piece was written in), despite them being needed to provide a full, loud orchestral sound. Schubert therefore considered using trombones for this purpose, as they were not so restricted and could reinforce the bass register of the orchestra; but due to his then being unfamiliar with how to write for the trombone, and the fact that the symphony was not conceived with the use of trombones in mind, he abandoned work on D 708A and started writing the seventh symphony, in which he decided to use a trio of trombones from the very beginning. He later had to abandon work on that symphony as well to work on his opera Alfonso und Estrella. Schubert's use of trombones can later be seen in the eighth, ninth, and tenth symphonies. =Discovery= In the mid-20th century, Dr Ernst Hilmar discovered in a library in Vienna (the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus) a folio containing works by Schubert, titled \\"Sinfonie\\" and dated to May 1818. It contained sketches for nine movements, all in D major or related keys. In 1951, Otto Erich Deutsch assumed in the first edition of his catalogue of Schubert's works that all the material was for one symphony, which he labelled D 615. However, stylistic evidence shows that the material could not all have been for one symphony, aside from the fact that there was simply too much material to serve for one symphony. In fact the folio was labelled \\"Zwei Symphonien in D\\" (\\"Two Symphonies in D\\"), indicating that a librarian had previously thought along similar lines around 1900. A 1978 analysis of watermarks and handwriting proved that there was really three symphonies present: these were D 615 (2 movements, written 1818), D 708A (4 movements, written 1821), and D 936A (3 movements, written 1828; commonly referred to as Schubert's tenth symphony). These separate Deutsch numbers were given in the 1978 second edition of the Deutsch catalogue. =Completion= As the sketches for D 708A were more fragmentary than those for D 936A, Brian Newbould did not attempt to complete D 708A when he worked on completing Schubert's seventh, eighth and tenth symphonies in the 1990s, although he did orchestrate the existing fragments. It was only with the commission from BBC Radio 3 in 2012 that he embarked on the project to complete D 708A.Spirit of Schubert ‚Äì Brian NewbouldSpirit of Schubert Season comes to Radio 3 Movements * Schubert/Newbould Symphony D 708A in D major # [Allegro vivace], # [Andante con moto], # [Scherzo: Allegro vivace], # [Presto], Extant material of every movement The sketches are written on two staves, with voice leading, and harmonies ranging from complete to partly indicated. The manuscript contains five instrumental indications, confirming that the intended orchestra was most probably similar in size to the sixth symphony, without trombones (that would become part of the Schubertian orchestra only in the seventh and later symphonies). Conforming to this symphony still being firmly in the Classical style, this orchestra was the same as that employed in the symphonies of the Viennese masters Haydn, Mozart, and the first two symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven. The sketches total about 18 minutes of music; Newbould's completion lasts 35 minutes. =First movement= : \\\\relative c { \\\\tempo \\"[Allegro vivace]\\" \\\\key d \\\\major 2.\\\\ff r8 d,-.\\\\p  cis( d) e-. fis-. g4 r  2.\\\\ff r8 e,-.\\\\p  dis( e) fis-. g-. a4 r  2.\\\\ff r8 fis,-.\\\\f  eis( fis) gis-. ais-. b( ais) gis-. fis-. } :First theme : \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major c2\\\\pp es4 as4  c2. bes4  as g f es  as2. bes4  as g f es  as2 es'  g, as4 f  es f es des } :Second theme The spirited first movement was almost certainly intended to be in sonata form, but the sketch breaks off at the end of the exposition. It is the only first movement of a Schubert symphony (barring the unfinished tenth symphony) that begins immediately with the first theme, without either a full slow introduction (as in the ninth) or a prefatory theme (as in the eighth). It begins with a rhythmic first theme in D major, which forms the basis for the accompaniment to the second theme; however, it abruptly and surprisingly grinds to a halt on an augmented sixth chord on the subdominant. After a modulatory passage in the transition, the second theme is first exposed in A major, a tritone away from the original tonic, before modulating to the conventional dominant (A major). This is unprecedented in any works by the most important Viennese composers. =Second movement= : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 3/8 \\\\tempo \\"[Andante con moto]\\" \\\\key a \\\\major cis16. gis32 a4  e'16. bis32 cis4  cis16 b b cis b gis  e16. fis64 gis a4  cis16 gis a4  e'16 bis cis4  cis16 b b cis b gis } :Opening The lyrical slow second movement is written in the dominant key of A major, but there is a great deal of modal mixture. After the first theme is first exposed in A major, a transition in the parallel minor leads to a restatement of the theme in F major, in which another theme is heard in two-part invertible counterpoint. The sketch ends here. The initial statement of the first theme has a different rhythm than all its other statements. Newbould decided to regularize it in his completion, which he stated was the only time in his completion that he altered what Schubert wrote. One of Schubert's instrumental cues in the sketch appears here, giving a melody to the clarinet. This is however very inconvenient due to the high tessitura of this melody, going up to written G6 (sounding E6). =Third movement= : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 3/4 \\\\tempo \\"[Scherzo: Allegro vivace]\\" \\\\key d \\\\major d8\\\\pp d e d e d  cis cis d cis d cis  b cis d e fis g  fis e d cis b a  << { \\\\voiceOne a' a b a b a  g g a g a g} ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo g a fis d b d  fis g e cis a cis } >> } :Beginning of scherzo : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 3/4 \\\\key g \\\\major d4\\\\pp d b'~  b a d,~  d( g b  d2 a4)  c,\\\\< b a\\\\\\\\!  gis\\\\> dis' e~\\\\\\\\!  e e c'~  c b e,~  e a c  e d g, } :Beginning of trio The fast and light third movement is the most complete of all the movements in this sketch. It is a scherzo and trio written in the tonic key. The motive in eighth notes in its first bar was later reused in the scherzo of Schubert's ninth symphony. The opening is a lively fugato based on this motive, before the main melodies enter. The initial motive forms the basis for the accompaniment. The second section of the scherzo focuses around the mediant key of F minor before returning to the opening material. The trio is set in the subdominant key of G major; though incomplete, only a few bars have to be reconstructed for the movement to be performable. Again, the trio sends the clarinet into the extreme high register (up to sounding D6). =Fourth movement= : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 2/4 \\\\tempo \\"[Presto]\\" \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\times 2/3 {d8\\\\pp e d} \\\\times 2/3 {a a a}  \\\\times 2/3 {fis' g fis} \\\\times 2/3 {a, a a}  \\\\times 2/3 {fis' e cis} \\\\times 2/3 {a cis e}  \\\\times 2/3 {b' a fis} \\\\times 2/3 {fis fis fis}  \\\\times 2/3 {d8 e d} \\\\times 2/3 {a a a}  \\\\times 2/3 {fis' g fis} \\\\times 2/3 {a, a a} } :Opening The fourth movement is the finale, in sonata rondo form. Schubert started a first version, which he then crossed out to begin the movement anew. It opens with a melody in triplets on the flute; due to the triplets throughout, the movement gives the appearance of being in . Despite Schubert's attempting to reduce the influence of Rossini in his style here, the crescendo after the first statement of the theme is strongly reminiscent of Rossini's style. The movement breaks off at what appears to be the start of the recapitulation, on the dominant, as in the similar tarantella-finale of his third symphony, D 200. Unusually, the music reaches the key of A major during a climactic passage, using the chords of A major and C major. This means that the horns, trumpets and timpani have to remain silent despite their being conventionally present during climactic passages. This creates problems in orchestrating the symphony in Schubert's style, and is probably why the symphony was left unfinished. Due to the impossibility of using those instruments when necessary, Schubert considered using trombones for the finale, which could be used there. But because he had not originally intended the symphony to include trombones and was still unfamiliar with how to use them, he set this work aside to begin a new symphony that would be written for an orchestra with a trio of trombones added. This was the seventh symphony, D 729, which also remained incomplete. Newbould's completion Due to the smaller amount of available material in this sketch than in the seventh, eighth, and tenth symphonies (which Newbould had previously completed), Newbould's completion is highly conjectural, especially in the development sections which were entirely absent from the sketch. Almost half of the final work was reconstructed by Newbould. It has been subsequently performed, recorded, published, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3. Its world premiere was given by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Juanjo Mena, on 29 March 2012. Newbould states that he thought about the sketch deeply in his completion attempt, eventually memorizing it and pretending to himself to have composed it in order to be able to find natural ways to develop the material. The entire development section of the first movement is absent from the sketch and had to be reconstructed by Newbould. This was challenging due to the exhaustive treatment of the thematic material by Schubert in the exposition alone. The recapitulations largely follow the exposition, with the necessary transpositions made. Newbould adds to the second movement a modulatory passage leading into various keys before reentering the tonic key, only to move into C major for another statement of the first theme. After this statement, the second theme is restated in the tonic key, followed by another transition. A coda, based on the first theme, finishes the work in the tonic key. Despite the inconvenience of the allocation of the high melody to the clarinet in this movement and the scherzo, Newbould eventually decided to respect Schubert's marking in his completion, although this was not an easy decision. In the third movement, being largely complete in Schubert's sketch, only a few bars needed to be added to complete the structure. The fourth movement was completed according to sonata-rondo form. Newbould's completion does not use trombones.

This method is distinguished from other sorts of Petri nets by the possibility to provide their tokens with a proper structure, which is based on Petri net modelling again. Hence, a net can contain further net items, being able to move around and fire themselves.  Motivation  Nets within nets are well suited for the modelling of distributed systems under the particular aspects of * hierarchy, * mobility * encapsulation. In a lot of publications in relation to object-oriented design is given, in order to combine the ability of Petri nets in modelling distributed computing with the modelling of objects, being able to be created and to interact.  History  Starting from the need of practical applications, by the mid of nineties, different formalisms have been created, which fit the description of ‚Äûnets within nets‚Äú. Lomazova and Schnoebelen are listingIrina A. Lomazova, Philippe Schnoebelen: Some decidability results for nested Petri nets, Springer LNCS 1755, 2000, pp. 208-220 some of these approaches, namely by Sibertin-Blanc,Christophe Sibertin-Blanc: Cooperative Nets, Springer LNCS 815, 1994, pp. 471-490 Lakos,Charles Lakos: From coloured Petri nets to object Petri nets, Springer LNCS 935, 1995, pp. 278-297 Moldt und WienbergDaniel Moldt und Frank Wienberg: Multi-agent-systems based on coloured Petri nets, Springer LNCS 1248, 1997, pp. 82-101 as extending Coloured Petri nets, aside the Object Nets of Valk.R√ºdiger Valk: Petri nets as token objects, Springer LNCS 1420, 1998, pp. 1-24 The earliest use of such hierarchic net models appeared by R√ºdiger Valk in Valk and Jessen,Eike Jessen, R√ºdiger Valk: Rechensysteme: Grundlagen der Modellbildung, Springer, 1987 where the so-called task-flow netsR√ºdiger Valk: Modelling Concurrency by Task/Flow EN Systems. Proceedings 3rd Workshop on Concurrency and Compositionality, GMD-Studien Nr. 191, Bonn, 1991 are introduced in order to model task systems in operating systems. In these models tasks are modelled by a Petri net, which represents the precedences of tasks and their state of execution.  Semantics  The most important differences in semantics is given by the execution of net tokens. On the one side net tokens can be references to net items,Olaf Kummer: Referenznetze, Dissertation, Universit√§t Hamburg, Logos Verlag Berlin 2002 which case is called ‚Äûreference semantics‚Äú. This kind of semantic is distinguished from value semantics, where net objects may exist in different places and different internal states. In value semantics different copies can be created to model concurrent execution. The corresponding join of such a split can be defined in different ways, as for instance by ‚Äûdistributed token semantics‚ÄúMichael K√∂hler, Heiko R√∂lke: Properties of Object Petri Nets. Springer LNCS 3099, 2004, pp. 278-297 or ‚Äûhistory process semantics‚Äú.R√ºdiger Valk: Object Petri Nets, Springer LNCS 3098, 2004, pp. 819-848 In connection with mobile computing hybrid versions of reference and value semantics are of importance.Berndt Farwer, Michael K√∂hler: Modelling global and local name spaces for mobile agents using object nets, Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol. 72, No 1, pp. 109-122, 2006 In distributed token semantics the important calculus of place invariants for Petri nets remains valid.Michael K√∂hler-Bu√ümeier, Daniel Moldt: Analysis of mobile agents using invariants of object nets. Electronic Communications of the EASST: Special Issue on Formal Modeling of Adaptive and Mobile Processes, 12, 2009. http://www.easst.org/eceasst/  Communication  The formalism of nets within nets would be of few importance without communication between net tokens. Like in object-oriented programming communication of net tokens is introduced via predefined interfaces which are dynamically bound. Figure 1: Nested Petri net containing channels via inscriptions In Figure 1 a Petri net is shown containing a token Petri net in place ‚Äûa‚Äú. The token net can move around from place ‚Äûa‚Äú to place ‚Äûb‚Äú and back by firing of the transitions of the outer net. The channel inscriptions at the transitions behave like a call of a method, resulting in the synchronised firing of the calling transition in the outer net [e.g. labelled by x:forth()] and the called transition [e.g. labelled by :forth()] in the token net. The variable ‚Äûx‚Äú at an arrow is bound to the token net in the place connected with this arrow. The brackets may contain parameters to be passed. This example is so simple that reference and value semantics coincide.  Algorithms and restricted formalisms  Standard Petri net properties like reachability, boundedness and liveness show a mixed picture. A paper Michael K√∂hler- Bu√ümeier: A Survey of Decidability Results for Elementary Object Systems: Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol. 130, No 1, pp. 99-123, 2014 of K√∂hler-Bu√ümeier gives a survey on decidability results for elementary object systems. To reduce the complexity of the formalism subclasses have been defined by restricting the structure of the Petri nets, as for instance to state machines. Such restrictions still allow complex modelling of distributed and mobile systems, but have polynomial complexity in model checking.Frank Heitmann, Michael K√∂hler-Bu√ümeier: P- and t-systems in the nets-within-nets formalism: Springer LNCS 7347, 2012, pp. 368-387  Tools  * CO-OPN https://smv.unige.ch//research-projects/co-opn (based on algebraic high level nets) * RENEW http://www.renew.de (free development Model checking of reference nets with JAVA-Integration)Olaf Kummer, Frank Wienberg, Michael Duvigneau, J√∂rn Schumacher, Michael K√∂hler, Daniel Moldt, Heiko R√∂lke, R√ºdiger Valk, : An Extensible Editor and Simulation Engine for Petri Nets: Renew: Springer LNCS 3099, 2004, pp. 484-493  References  Category:Formal specification languages Category:Models of computation Category:Concurrency (computer science) Category:Diagrams Category:Software modeling language ","title":"Nets within Nets"},{"id":"41546616","text":"Franca Ma√Ø (born Fran√ßoise Baud; 26 July 1959 - 8 February 2012) was as French actress and novelist.

The settlement of Rotbav is situated upon a high terrace formation above the Olt River. Its importance lies in a long stratigraphy comprising the timespan from the Early Bronze Age to the Bronze Age / Iron Age transition. It is the most extensively researched site of this period in the region.L. Dietrich, Eliten der fr√ºhen und mittleren Bronzezeit im s√ºd√∂stlichen Karpatenbecken.

Pr√§historische Zeitschrift 85, 2010, 191-206 The settlement has a size of approximately 4 ha, of which 1800 square meters were excavated, the whole area was additionally investigated by archaeological and geophysical surveys (magnetometry).  Natural environment  Natural conditions and resources such as salt and metals characterize southeastern Transylvania as one of the most favourable Bronze Age settlement areas in Europe.A. Harding, V. Kavruk, Explorations in salt archaeology in the Carpathian zone (Budapest 2013). Easily accessible passes through the Carpathian Mountains make it an important communication area between the eastern Eurasian steppes, the Eastern Mediterranean region and Central Europe. Comparatively few Bronze Age sites were excavated in this region so far, Rotbav is the only multi-stratified site in which the whole development from the Early until the Late Bronze Age (a period of about 800 years) could be observed. Archaeological Site of Rotbav, southeastern Transylvania, Romania  Archaeological Site  According to radiocarbon data, the Bronze Age settlement of Rotbav was inhabited between 1900/1800 and 1200/1100 BC (calibrated data). The site was then abandoned-possibly due to climatic deterioration and erosion processes-and never settled again. Agricultural use of the area started at the latest with the establishment of the medieval settlement of Rotbav around 1250 AD. Stratigraphy The stratigraphic sequence covers six distinct building phases. The first three belong to the early Middle Bronze Age Wietenberg Culture,N.G.O Boroffka, Die Wietenberg-Kultur. Ein Beitrag zur Erforschung der Bronzezeit in S√ºdosteuropa (Bonn 1994). followed by two of the Late Bronze Age Noua Culture.A. C. Florescu, Repertoriul culturii Noua-Coslogeni din Rom√¢nia.

Additionally, in a small part of the site traces of the Late Copper Age Baden-Co·π≠ofeni Culture were discovered. Rotbav 1-3: The Wietenberg Settlement Portable stove of the Wietenberg culture from Rotbav, Transylvania, Romania In the first three building phases belonging to the Wietenberg Culture small houses of about 20-25 square meters were documented. They were constructed of wooden posts and wattle covered by daub, some daub walls were ornamented with spirals. The flours were of pis√©. Such constructions leave few traces and are archaeologically almost invisible, so that only a minor number could be documented. Inside the houses storage pits and fireplaces were found, separate storage areas for vessels are attested, too. In addition, special fireplaces used in cultic activities existed near the houses. They consist of round burnished clay surfaces decorated with spirals; in pits below them fragments of miniature wheels and wagons were found. On the basis of palynological and archaeozoological data, the diet mainly consisted of einkorn wheat, barley and bromus, cattle, sheep, pigs and goats. A lucky find is a vessel from a pit containing the carbonized rests of a gruel made inter alia of acorns and meat. The cemetery was placed on the north border of the settlement; so far two urn graves were excavated. Presumably only a very small part of the population was actually buried, the Wietenberg Culture¬¥s cemeteries are generally very small.N.G.O Boroffka, Die Wietenberg-Kultur. Ein Beitrag zur Erforschung der Bronzezeit in S√ºdosteuropa (Bonn 1994) In the case of Rotbav, the dead were well burnt, then the bones were collected and put in the funerary urn, which was put in a bigger pit and surrounded by river snail shells.L.

The characteristic find category of this period is the fine pottery, which was produced in large numbers and extensively decorated. The hard, well- burnt red or black ware bears incisions, stamps and impressions, which were finally filled with a white substance, probably made of bones or lime. The earlier pottery shows geometrical motifs, in the second and third phase S- and Z-shaped hooks appear, which were most probably abstract representations of animals with a symbolic meaning in the community¬¥s cosmology.L.

Rotbav 4-5: The Noua Settlement Crenated scapula from Rotbav, Transylvania, Romania At the beginning of the 15th century BC, after the last phase of the Wietenberg Culture, a sudden change in the development of the settlement appeared. The architecture, the funerary rite, the pottery and material culture in general changed. These changes resulted from the arrival of a new population from the Eurasian steppes, the so-called Noua-Sabatinovka- Coslogeni culture,A. C. Florescu, Repertoriul culturii Noua-Coslogeni din Rom√¢nia. A≈üezƒÉri ≈üi necropole. CulturƒÉ ≈üi Civiliza≈£ie la DunƒÉrea de Jos 9, 1991. in southeastern Transylvania. Houses are now characterized by massive limed floors, the fireplaces were situated outside. The cemetery of the new population lies to the south of the settlement. Inhumation graves in stone cists are now typical, the dead lie crouched on one side. Burial goods include vessels and food (animal bones). The pottery comprises much fewer shapes and is largely undecorated and coarse. The fine ware is represented exclusively by two- and one-handled drinking vessels (‚ÄúKantharoi‚Äù). A special feature of the earlier Noua building phase is a so-called ‚Äúashmound‚Äù. These round heaps formed of greyish sediments are typical for settlements of the Noua- Sabatinovka-Cologeni cultural complex.L. Dietrich, Visible workshops for invisible commodities. Leatherworking in the Late Bronze Age Noua culture¬¥s ‚Äòashmounds. In: S.C Ailincai, A. »ö√¢rlea, C. Micu (ed). Lower Danube Prehistory. 50 years of excavations at Babadag (1962-2012) (BrƒÉila, 2013), 227-246. Until recently they were believed to represent the remains of houses or burned waste. New evidence shows that the ‚Äúashmounds‚Äù are not randomly formed mounds of waste, but special, collectively used places at the boundaries of settlements; they are not piled on the walking level, but in intentionally dug round basins. Chemical evidence from Rotbav and other sites proves the sediment to be constituted not of ash, but of a mixture of earth and burnt lime. Burnt lime is ethnographically known to have been used for departing hair from hides. Tools for the scraping of hides, needles, awls and a considerable amount of animal bones give further prove to an intense production of leather. Concentrations of drinking vessels and cooking utensils prove that the ‚Äòashmounds‚Äô may also have played a role in feasting.L. Dietrich, Visible workshops for invisible commodities.

Rotbav 6: The G√°va Settlement Vessel of the G√°va culture from Rotbav, Transylvania, Romania Slow changes of the material culture mark the last building phase in Rotbav. Pottery shapes and ornamentation, especially with the coarse ware, have many similarities with the earlier phase. The typical two- and one-handled drinking vessels however are replaced by a new category of fine ware which is adopted from western Transylvania. This new style is characterized by channelled ornamentation, mainly realized on hard baked black (outside) and red/orange (inside) pottery with polished surfaces. A new settlement layout develops as a consequence of climatic changes.F. Falkenstein, Eine Katastrophen-Theorie zum Beginn der Urnenfelderkultur, in Becker u. a (Hrsg.) Chronos. Festschrift f√ºr Bernhardt H√§nsel (Espelkamp 1997), 549-563. Up to 12 m long semi-subterranean dwellings are now attested. They are regularly dispersed over the settled area with open spaces of approximately 8 m between them, the fireplaces as well as numerous bell-shaped storage pits are situated outside the houses.

The waste that the writ would issue to prevent would be waste that occurred in response to a lawsuit seeking possession of the land, or a judgment against the waster where possession had not yet been delivered.  England  In his Commentaries, Blackstone noted that this common law writ would lie originally to prevent waste that took place between judgment in a real action and delivery of possession by the sheriff. Following the Statute of Gloucester, a writ of estrepement pendente placito would lie to prevent estrepement pending the outcome of a case. Either writ empowered the sheriff to prevent such waste, allowing him to imprison the waster, and even to raise a posse comitatus to assist him. According to Finlason, the basic writ of estrepement was an original writ that had to be sued out of chancery, whereas the writ pendente placito was a writ issued from the bench. Where the tenant is alleged to have disobeyed the writ, a venire facias would issue and the tenant would be attached. The standard pleading in response was to deny any waste contrary to the writ,The specific phrase was Non fecit vastum contra prohibitionem. . See also 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *227. and the issue would be tried by a jury, with the outcome resulting in a conviction for contempt of court. When John Puckering was Lord Keeper, one of his actions was to restrict the issuance of writs of estrepement, as well as other writs such as audita querela, unless he allowed it. Holdsworth suggests this might have been part of an effort to keep the courts of common law from entering into matters of equity. While analogous to the injunction in equity, one major difference is that the grounds for the issuance of the writ was not the inequitable conduct of the defendant, but that the use of the land in the manner prohibited would work to commit a wrong. Also, unlike injunctions and the writ of prohibition, the writ of estrepement merely stopped further damage, and could not command the repair or replacement of property already damaged. Two important similarities are that both are in personam orders, and that disobedience may result in imprisonment. The injunction ultimately supplanted the writ, and the writ was ultimately abolished in England by the Real Property Limitation Act 1833.  United States  In the United States, the writ of estrepement persisted in some state courts for a time, but is rarely used.93 C.J.S. Waste ¬ß 24. For instance, in the 1844 case of Brown v. O'Brien, the writ pendente placito issued in a Pennsylvania ejectment case where evidence was proffered indicating that the tenants were in the process of cutting timber and digging for minerals in the land at issue. By 1929, one law review noted that the injunction had \\"to a great extent\\" taken the place of estrepement and common law actions for waste generally. As late as 1978, however, the writ may have been available in Delaware, which has not combined its courts of law and equity. In Voss v. Green,Voss v. Green, 389 A.2d 273 (Del. Super. Ct. 1978) the plaintiffs brought an ejectment action in the Superior Court contending that the defendants had built a driveway on their land, and in response the defendants sought a writ of estrepement because the plaintiffs had plowed up the driveway. The court declined to issue the writ, holding that the damage done was not within the scope of the writ, and that the appropriate relief was an injunction, which would have to be obtained in the Court of Chancery. One source notes that the writ still exists in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.2 Tiffany Real Prop. ¬ß 647 n.83 (3d ed.)

Born in Zimnicea, Teleorman County, he went to high school in Ploie»ôti, after which he studied fine arts, first in Cluj and later in Bucharest without graduating. He enrolled then at the Letters and Philosophy Department of the University of Bucharest. A leftist in his youth (he joined the Union of Communist Youth in 1933), he wrote for many leftist papers and magazines of those days: \\"Cuv√Æntul liber\\", \\"Azi\\", \\"Facla\\", \\"Via»õa rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", \\"Era nouƒÉ\\", \\"Lumea rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", \\"Timpul\\", \\"Ecoul\\", \\"Rom√¢nia liberƒÉ\\", \\"Sc√Ænteia\\", sometimes under a pen name, among them Emil Soare and Paul Scor»õeanu. After World War II, he wrote many propagandistic articles although it seems that he never became a member of the Communist Party. Being on friendly terms with many communist leaders from their days in the underground, like Miron Constantinescu, Constan≈£a CrƒÉciun, Iosif Chi≈üinevschi, Leonte RƒÉutu, he was considered \\"invulnerable\\", and got away with criticizing the regime, mostly in private, when anybody else would have ended in prison for the same offence. Although he hoped, due to his antifascist past, to be given important government positions like his former comrades, he never got any, being sent instead to work for several magazines and papers. He and Sorin Toma bitterly criticized Tudor Arghezi in 1948, accusing him of being a representative of \\"decadent, bourgois art\\". In 1965, Paraschivescu took charge of the readers' column at the literary magazine Ramuri in Craiova, changing it in May 1966 into a four-page literary supplement called Povesta vorbei (\\"The Tale of Talk\\"). It lasted only six numbers. He transformed it into a meeting place for a number of young avantgarde writers who had difficulty getting published by the established literary press. Among them were: Leonid Dimov, Virgil Mazilescu and Dumitru »öepeneag. Known for being sometimes a \\"difficult person\\" and a \\"big mouth\\", Paraschivescu was hospitalized at least twice in mental institutions. Somewhat of a Don Juan, Paraschivescu was married five times.

Career He trained as a soldier and progressed to lieutenant colonel of the States-General of the Netherlands. Mauritz de Chavonnes was in charge of the infantry regiment in the army of the Dutch Republic during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713). After the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war, he joined the Dutch East India Company, who appointed him as the Cape Governor in 1714, replacing Louis van Assenburgh who had died on 27 December 1712.Die Suid-Afrikaanse Krygshistoriese Vereniging, Governor Mauritz Pasque de Chavonnes and the First Military Uniforms at the Cape, Military History Journal - Vol 6 No 2, Besoek op 3 Junie 2007 Within the first few months after arrival in the Cape he regulated the responsibilities of the garrison and for the first time in the Cape's history allowed the soldiers to wear uniforms and drafted instructions for the use of weapons and ammunition. De Chavonnes also instituted grazing licenses for the Cape stock farmers: in July 1714 he decided that (according to the Politieke Raad) \\"every person that has the requirement for grazing on any land shall request permission, and for recognition shall pay a semi-annual fee of six or an annual fee of twelve Dutch rijksdaalder to the Company\\". Furthermore, the farmers had to pay tithes of all their harvests to the Dutch East India Company. He contributed to the development of the Cape and was promoted to Justice of India in 1721. His military innovations included the organisation of so-called Free Black and Asian citizens in Table Valley into a military unit called Companie Vryswarten (Company Free Blacks) in 1722 under the command of their own officers.

The work incorporates radical innovations, considered ahead of their time, including some of the earliest examples of string piano (playing directly on the strings of the piano), and Langgaard's extensive use of slow moving string clusters prompted the composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti to proclaim himself a \\"Langgaard-epigone\\" when presented with the score in the late 1960s. Analysis According to the music researcher Eric Christensen ‚Äì in an analysis of works utilizing the \\"spatial dimension\\" as a fundamental concept ‚Äì the space of Music of the Spheres is limited at the upper level by repeated lines of high notes on the violins and flutes, and at the lower level by timpani and deep horns. In between it is filled out with clusters and polyphonic tonal surfaces that remove the sense of time moving forward. Instead, it makes time \\"acutely present\\" by accelerating repetitive patterns. The form of the work is accumulative and concludes with a vision of \\"the end of all things\\" expressed with stark musical contrast, such as violent music followed by noisy \\"anti-music\\" (produced by cymbals and kettle-drums) juxtaposed with \\"heavenly\\" music with angel choirs and the sound of harps.

The premiere was a success, but the following year it received a more lukewarm reception when performed in Berlin. It was not performed again until 1968, where a performance in Stockholm with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sergiu Comissiona, ignited a renaissance for Langgaard's music. The first performance in Denmark took place in 1969 in \\"Rundh√∏jhallen\\" in Holme with Aarhus Symphony Orchestra and Choir, conducted by Per Dreier. Unfortunately the soprano soloist, Margrethe Danielsen, did not make it in time for the concert. In 1971, a reduced version was performed in Copenhagen, but the first complete performance in Denmark, all forces present, took place in 1980 in the concert hall of Radiohuset with Edith Guillaume (soprano), and the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and Choir, conducted by John Frandsen. In 2010, Music of the Spheres received its British premiere at the BBC Proms, with the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and Choir, conducted by Thomas Dausgaard. A performance lasts around 35 minutes. Recordings The first recording of Music of the Spheres was made in 1968 at the Nordic Music Days in Stockholm with Berit Lindholm (soprano), Akademiska K√∂ren (The Stockholm Academic Choir), and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sergiu Comissiona.

Two successive Belgian governments were established at Sainte- Adresse, near Le Havre, in France during World War I when most of Belgium was under German occupation after October 1914. They were both led by Charles de Broqueville as prime minister. The first government, known as the de Broqueville I government, was a Catholic government which elected in 1911 and continued until 1916, when it was joined by Socialists and Liberals expanding it into the de Broqueville II government which would last until 1 June 1918. Departure for Le Havre 2014 October, centenary in Le Havre - Sainte- Adresse. By October 1914, the vast majority of Belgian territory (2,598 out of 2,636 communes) was under German occupation. The only portion of Belgium that remained controlled by the Kingdom of Belgium in exile was the strip of territory behind the Yser Front. In October 1914, the government moved to the French coastal city of Le Havre. It was established in the large Immeuble Dufayel (\\"Dufayel Building\\"), built by the French businessman Georges Dufayel in 1911, situated in the suburb of Sainte-Adresse. The whole area of Sainte- Adresse, which still carries the national colours of Belgium on its shield, was leased to Belgium by the French government as a temporary administrative centre while the rest of Belgium was occupied. The area had a sizeable Belgian √©migr√© population, and even used Belgian postage stamps. King Albert I considered that it was inappropriate for the King to leave his own country and so did not join his government in Le Havre. Instead, he established his staff in the Flemish town of Veurne, just behind the Yser Front, in the last strip of unoccupied Belgian territory. Composition The de Broqueville government comprised: *Baron Charles de Broqueville (Catholic) as Prime Minister (known as chef du cabinet until November 1918). *Henry Carton de Wiart (Catholic), Minister of Justice *Julien Davignon (Catholic), Minister of Foreign Affairs until 18 January 1916 *Paul Berryer (Catholic), Minister of the Interior *Prosper Poullet (Catholic), Minister of Arts and Sciences, as well as Minister for Economic Affairs after 1 January 1918 *Aloys Van de Vyvere (Catholic), Minister of Finance *Georges Helleputte (Catholic), Minister of Agriculture and Public Works *Armand Hubert (Catholic), Minister of Industry and Work *Paul Segers (Catholic), Minister of Railways, the Marine, and the PTT *Armand De Ceuninck (technocrat), Minister of War after 4 August 1917 *Jules Renkin (Catholic), Minister of the Colonies *Baron Eug√®ne Beyens (technocrat), member of the Council of Ministers after 30 July 1916; Minister of Foreign Affairs between 18 January 1916 to 4 August 1917 *Paul Hymans (Liberal), member of the Council of Ministers after 18 January 1916; Minister of Economic Affairs from 12 November 1917 to 1 January 1918; Minister of Foreign Affairs after 1 January 1918. *Count Eug√®ne Goblet d'Alviella (Liberal), member of the Council of Ministers after 18 January 1916 *Emile Vandervelde (Socialist), member of the Council of Ministers after 18 January 1916; Minister of Supplies after 4 August 1917 *Emile Brunet (Socialist), member of the Council of Ministers after 1 January 1918. Criticism The Flamingant poet Ren√© de Clercq published a poem called Aan Die Van Havere (\\"To those of Le Havre\\") in 1916, in which he accused the government (the \\"Lords of Le Havre\\") of having forgotten the plight of Flanders.

Affirmative Action in China and the U.S.: A Dialogue on Inequality and Minority Education. Palgrave Macmillan, October 13, 2009. , 9780230100923. Pages 8-14. The policies giving preferential treatment to ethnic minorities in China. For example, minority ethnic groups in China were not subjected to its well- publicized one-child policy.Sautman, p. 77. Three principles are the basis for the policy: equality for national minorities, territorial autonomy, and equality for all languages and cultures. The Chinese government has been scaling back on affirmative action since 2019. Affirmative action policies No taxes in minority regions are required to be sent to the central government; all of it can be spent locally. Minorities receive proportional representation in local government. Higher-level jurisdictions ask lower-level minority areas to put forth \\"extensive efforts to support the country's construction by providing more natural resources\\" and in exchange gives them infrastructural subsidies such as personnel training, budgetary subventions, and disproportionate public works investments.Sautman, p. 78. The Chinese government encourages business to hire minorities and offers no-interest loans to businesses operated by minorities. Prominent government posts may be filled with \\"model\\" citizens who are also minorities. Minority students applying to universities receive bonus points on the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (gaokao). The World; Affirmative Action, Chinese Style, Makes Some Progress, Nicholas D. Kristof, March 31, 1991 In 2009 authorities in Chongqing uncovered 31 high school students pretending to be members of a minority group in order to gain test points, and in 2011 Inner Mongolia authorities uncovered about 800 students pretending to be members of a minority group. There is a system of universities exclusively for minority students. The government established bilingual programs to help minorities learn Mandarin Chinese. Scholars are creating alphabets for minority languages that had not been previously written as a way of preserving those languages. The Chinese government officially allowed minority parents to have more than one child per family instead of the one demanded for Han people as part of the one-child policy. Rena Singer of Knight-Ridder Newspapers wrote that \\"In practice, many minority families simply have as many children as they want.\\" Singer wrote that the policies are meant to encourage assimilation instead of empowering minority blocs and \\"The idea is to give the minorities just enough power, education or economic success to keep them quiet.\\"Singer, Rena. \\"China's Minorities Get Huge Affirmative-Action Benefits.\\" (Archive) Knight-Ridder Newspapers at The Seattle Times. Tuesday August 26, 1997. Retrieved on January 4, 2014. An article by Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times describes the opposite effect: families that might have preferred to assimilate by identifying as Han instead maintain their minority identity, for the increased policy benefit and social opportunities.  Historical precedents  Fuk'anggan, a Manchu military leader, recommended for an increase in the quota for Hui people in the civil and military suishi examinations during a 1785 memorial from the governor of Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. Li Zonghan (C: ÊùéÂÆóÁÄö, P: L«ê Z≈çngh√†n, W: Li Tsung-han), the Hunan provincial education commissioner, requested a quota for Miao people candidates for provincial examinations during an 1807 memorial. This is so the Han Chinese people, who had better preparation to take the examinations, would not crowd out Miao. Li Zonghan argued that local officials would need to have suspicion of Han pretending to be Miao in order to fit the quota criteria. Taiwanese Plains Aborigines also had a quota under the Qing. Influence on Chinese society The affirmative action of the Chinese government has been called into question of late, especially from the ethnic group of Han Chinese. Unfair policies on Chinese College entrance exams as well as human rights considered to be favoring the national minority have both been believed to be causing reverse discrimination in the mainland. Han chauvinism has been becoming more popular in mainland China since the 2000s, the cause of which has been attributed to the discontent towards Chinese affirmative action.„ÄäÂá≠Ê†èËßÇÂè≤„ÄãÁ¨¨34ÊúüÔºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÂà∞Â∫ïÊúâÊ≤°ÊúâÂ§ßÊ±âÊóè‰∏ª‰πâ Since Xi Jinping has assumed power as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012, he has increased efforts to assimilate the people with mainland China.

At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed to a sign painter, where he painted tinned can of food. He then taught himself how to paint by copying borrowed paintings. He then practised drawings at the National Academy Museum and School in New York City from 1826 to 1827. Career Varina Howell Davis by John Wood Dodge, 1849; National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C. Kate Roselie Dodge by John Wood Dodge, 1854; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City Dodge focused on painting miniatures on ivory. From 1830 to 1838, his work was exhibited at the National Academy Museum and School in New York City. He was also elected an associated of this academy in 1832. Dodge moved to Alabama in 1838, finally settling down in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lived and worked for twenty-one years. In 1840, he published an article entitled 'Painting and Daguerreotype' in which he criticized the invention of the photography, as it made miniature paintings less popular. Still, in 1842, he did a portrait of Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845), whose reproduction as a miniature was widely popular nationally. In 1849, he did a portrait of Varina Howell Davis (1826‚Äì1906), the second wife of Confederate President Jefferson Davis (1808‚Äì1889). However, by the 1850s, he began to take pictures. In 1861, Dodge left Tennessee and returned to New York City, as he supported the Union. In 1865, his new portrait of Andrew Jackson was widely popular again, and widely reproduced. From 1870 to 1888, he moved to Chicago, where he served as Vice President of the (now-defunct) Chicago Academy of Design from 1874 to 1875. In 1888, he returned to his farm in Tennessee, where he continued to paint until 1893.

On 28 December 2013, a Sunni MP named Ahmed al-Alwani was arrested in a raid on his home in Ramadi. Alwani was a prominent supporter of the anti- government protests. This incident led to violence in Al Anbar Governorate between the Iraqi Army and a loose alliance of tribal militias and other groups fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In January 2014, the anti-government forces took control of Fallujah, and there was heavy fighting in Ramadi. In March the Iraqi army secured Ramadi and attempted to regain Fallujah. In June, ISIL launched a major offensive in Anbar in conjunction with their assault on Northern Iraq. By 23 June, they controlled at least 70% of Anbar.  Background  Demonstrators protesting against Maliki in Ramadi in the Square of Pride and Dignity (Al-Bu Farraj) Prior to the campaign, Sunnis in Al Anbar Governorate, including members of the Dulaim tribe, held anti-government rallies and demonstrations from December 2012 to December 2013. The protests began on 21 December 2012 following a raid on the home of Sunni Finance Minister Rafi al-Issawi and the arrest of 10 of his bodyguards. The protests were driven by Sunnis who felt marginalized in post-Saddam Iraq, and who claimed that anti-terrorism laws were being abused and used to arrest and harass Sunnis. The growth of the protests, however, led the initial demands to be expanded, and eventually one of the main requests of the protesters was the resignation of Prime Minister Maliki. Other issues often cited were the abuse of De-Baathification laws and unfair confiscation of property of former Baathists, and Iranian interference in Iraqi affairs.Iraqi Speaker Comments On Protests, Syria ‚Äì Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East = Groups involved = The tribes of Dulaim, Zoba, Al-Jumeilat, and Al-Bu Issa tribal fighters were the main component in fighting the Iraqi army. There are several groups comprising the non-ISIL armed opposition. Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order (JRTN) were also said to be part of the Sunni opposition to the Iraqi government. The Military Council of the Tribal Revolutionaries (MCIR), the largest of the non-ISIL groups, appears to include a number of groups previously involved in the Iraqi Insurgency including the JRTN, 1920 Revolution Brigade, the Islamic Army in Iraq, the Jaish al-Rashideen, Iraqi Hamas, and the former Mujahideen Shura Council of Abdullah al-Janabi. A second group, known as the Anbar Tribes Revolutionary Council is headed by Sheikh Ali Hatim al-Suleiman. This group, unlike the MCTR, doesn't actively advocate the overthrow of the Iraqi government but instead is limited in ambition to defending Anbar from what it sees as aggression from the Iraqi central government. The final group is known as the Army of Pride and Dignity, although the group is distinct from the group of the same name formed by Sheikh Ali Hatem Suleiman following the 2013 Hawija clashes.  2013 = December = Clashes in western Iraq began on 30 December 2013 when Iraqi security forces arrested Sunni MP Ahmed al-Alwani and clashed with some of his relatives from the Albo-alon clan of the Dulaim tribe, the largest tribe in Anbar. on the second day Iraqi security forces tore down a year-old Sunni protest camp in Ramadi. Tribal militias battled against the Iraqi Army in Ramadi and Fallujah. After the Iraqi Army withdrew from Anbar province to cool the situation on 31 December, tribal militants took over Fallujah and Karma and most of the city of Ramadi. Shortly after, militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) entered some of the neighborhoods of Ramadi and other parts of Anbar. Following the arrival of ISIL, some tribal militias allied themselves with ISIL forces. On 30 December 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said that Iraqi Army soldiers would depart to restive cities in Anbar province, but reversed that decision the following day.  2014 = January‚ÄìFebruary ‚Äì Fall of Fallujah and the Battle of Ramadi = Army forces, as of 2 January, remained outside Ramadi. On 3 January, al-Qaeda-linked militants took over several police stations in Fallujah. In the early morning, tribal and ISIL fighters advanced into areas in central Ramadi and deployed snipers on one street, a police captain said. A police colonel said the army had re-entered into areas of Fallujah, between Ramadi and Baghdad, but that around a quarter of it remained under ISIL and tribal control. However, another senior officer, a police lieutenant colonel, said that while soldiers had been deployed around the city, they had yet to enter Fallujah. More than 100 people were killed during the day as Iraqi police and tribesmen battled militants. On 4 January, the Iraqi government lost control of Fallujah to ISIL. The Iraqi Army also shelled Fallujah with mortars to try to wrest back control from the militants and tribesmen, killing at least eight people, according to unnamed tribal leaders and officials. Unnamed medical sources in Fallujah said another 30 people were wounded in the shelling. On 3 January ISIL began distributing leaflets announcing a new \\"Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice\\" whose purpose was to enforce the group's strict Islamic code, similar to how the city was governed from 2005 to 2006 under the Mujahideen Shura Council. Two days after the fall of Fallujah Abdullah al-Janabi, the former Chief of the Mujahideen Shura Council, returned to the city, making an appearance on 4 January at the Saad bin Abi Waqas mosque in northern part of the city. At the mosque Janabi told worshippers that \\"Blood is on the hands of all policemen. Police buildings were used to torture and to extract confessions ... and must be cleansed.\\" Referring to the Iraqi Army, he also claimed that \\"We swear by God almighty and the blood of martyrs that the Safavid army will not enter the city except over our dead bodies.\\" During the appearance about 200 masked militants using looted police vehicles guarded the road leading to the mosque, where worshippers were checked for weapons before Janabi's sermon at weekly prayers. On 6 January, Iraqi security forces, backed by tribal fighters, regained control of the centre of Ramadi. However, clashes continued in the surrounding areas the next day, while in the city centre, government offices, hospitals and markets reopened. On 7 January, Iraqi missile strikes on Ramadi killed 25 militants. On the same day, unidentified gunmen also killed seven police officers, including a captain, in an attack at a security checkpoint on a highway north of the city of Samarra. Though no group claimed responsibility for the attack, police officials suspected the ISIL militants. As of 8 January, in addition to Fallujah, ISIL had control of the Anbar cities of Al- Karmah, Hƒ´t, Khaldiyah, Haditha, Al Qaim and parts of Ramadi and Abu Ghraib, along with numerous smaller settlements in Anbar. On 8 January, an unnamed Iraq police captain confirmed that an overnight offensive by security forces and tribal fighters aimed at dislodging ISIL from south Ramadi was repulsed by the insurgents after seven hours of heavy fighting. On 9 January, Iraqi security forces, backed by tanks, engaged in heavy fighting with ISIL militants in the Albubali area, between Ramadi and Fallujah. On 10 January, clashes erupted between Iraqi special forces and ISIL in al-Bubali village between Fallujah and Ramadi. On the same day, tribesmen and police retook two areas of Ramadi. On 14 January, Sunni fighters, including ISIL, overran several more areas of Ramadi. On 16 January, the Iraqi army, backed by Sunni tribesmen, managed to retake the city of Saqlawiyah in a counterattack against ISIL. On 17 January, the ISIL militants in Fallujah called on people to join them in their fight against the government, but earlier in the day, Iraqi media reported that security forces had retaken several key areas of Ramadi. On 19 January, the Iraqi army launched an operation in Ramadi. The advance was halted after eight police and tribal militia members were killed in clashes. The next day, an unnamed Iraqi official suggested that the ISIL had sufficient heavy weaponscapability to threaten Baghdad. On 21 January, the Iraqi army, backed by Sunni tribesmen, continued to attack key neighbourhoods of Ramadi in attempt to retake control from ISIL. The next day, the defence ministry claimed that at least 50 militants were killed in air strikes against militant targets in Anbar. On 26 January, according to witnesses, ISIL militants were reported to have captured five Iraqi soldiers near Fallujah. ISIL also seized six army Humvees and set fire to some of them after clashes with security forces near Fallujah. It was further reported that at least seven people were killed by Iraqi army airstrikes and artillery fire. On 30 January, Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad al-Askari said that security forces and their allied tribal fighters regained control of Albu Farraj, north of Ramadi, as well as Al-Nasaf, on the western outskirts of Fallujah; he called these areas an \\"important base\\" for ISIL. On 31 January, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence, the 39th Brigade of the Iraqi army, reinforced by the Iraqi Air Force with support from tribal fighters, killed 40 militants and captured ISIL's headquarters in Fallujah. On 1 February, the Iraqi army and police, with the support of pro-government militias, launched another offensive against ISIL in Ramadi and Fallujah. At least 35 militants were killed and large amounts of weaponry were seized in the clashes in the militant-held neighborhoods of Malaab, Dhubat, and Street 60 in Ramadi. On 3 February, the Ministry of Defence reported that the Iraqi army and its allied tribesmen killed 57 ISIL militants in advance of a possible assault on Fallujah, which was held by the rebels. On 8 February, Anbar Governor Ahmed Khalaf Dheyabi sent an ultimatum to ISIL calling on them to surrender within a week. On 9 February, 13 ISIL members were killed in Ramadi's Malab area. On 12 February, a senior ISIL leader, Abo Majid al-Saudi, was killed alongside seven other members of the group in eastern Ramadi. On 15 February, the Iraqi Joint Command announced that during a raid in the al-Milahma, Albu Shihab and Khalidiya areas several ISIL members were killed. On 18 February, 45 ISIL gunmen were killed, including Syrian and Afghan fighters. On 19 February, an ISIL leader, Abd Khaliq Mahedi, turned himself to the Chairman of Sons of Iraq Council, Mohamed al-Hayis, and declared his support to the security forces in combating ISIL. On 28 February, a bomb attack in Haditha killed the pro- government Sunni tribal Sheikh and councilman Fleih al-Osman and six of his fighters, while five civilians were wounded, according to police chief Colonel Farouq al-Jughaifi. = March‚ÄìMay ‚Äì Government counter-attack = On 16 March, Iraqi Security Forces recaptured Ramadi and parts of Fallujah. On 13 April, pro-government tribal fighters took control of the Fallujah Dam. On 7 May, reports emerged that Iraqi Security forces were planning a major strike to reclaim territories in Fallujah, Garma, Duwylieba and Jurf al-Sakhar. At this time, it was confirmed that ISIL took full control of Fallujah. On 9 May, the military launched its offensive and by 18 May, security forces regained control of the international expressway east of Fallujah and captured 16 villages and towns around the city. = June ‚Äì ISIL offensive = On 3 June, at least 18 people were killed and 43 wounded in shelling of Fallujah. On 7 June, gunmen linked to ISIL took students at the University of Anbar hostage after killing a number of guards and destroying \\"a bridge leading to the main gate.\\" The crisis was resolved when students were permitted to leave several hours later, departing the campus in buses provided by the local government. No students were reported to have been injured during the incident. On 12 June, an Iraqi Border Patrol battalion stationed along the Syrian border abandoned its positions in the face of advancing ISIL forces to break out to the relative safety of the Kurdish-controlled town of Sinjar in Nineveh. However, the convoy of 60 trucks and hundreds of border police were thrown into disarray and panic when a small force of ISIL vehicles attacked them en route. By the time Kurdish forces arrived, the police force had been completely routed and decimated with an unknown number of killed and captured, while others fled into the desert leaving all their vehicles behind. Only two policemen managed to arrive at Sinjar on foot. On 15 June, ISIL captured Saqlawiyah where army helicopters were hovering over the town to provide cover for retreating troops. During the fighting a helicopter was shot down. On 17 June, Syrian rebels, made up of the Free Syrian Army and the Al-Qaeda- affiliated Al-Nusra Front, captured the Al-Qaim border crossing between Syria and Iraq. On 19 June, ISIL captured Hussein's Al Muthanna Chemical Weapons Facility near Lake Tharthar, roughly 45 miles northwest of Baghdad, in an area which had firmly come under rebel control by this point. Later in the evening, fighting broke in Al-Qaim, near the border with Syria, and lasted until around noon the next day with most of the town coming under militant control. 34 members of the Iraqi security forces were killed in the clashes. The insurgent assault on the town started with a major artillery barrage which was followed by a major assault. Two days later, ISIL captured the Al-Qaim border crossing with Syria after Syrian rebels retreated. The town itself and the surrounding area had also been fully secured by ISIL. 11 soldiers and 20 militants were killed and 20 soldiers were wounded during fighting for Al-Qaim the previous day. ISIL then advanced further in the province and captured the towns of Rawa, Ana and Huseiba. The Iraqi army's regional command headquarters near Rawa and Ana had also become surrounded and much of Ramadi was reported to be militant-controlled. Overall, an entire Iraqi Security Force brigade was reportedly destroyed in the Al-Qaim area in the previous days. Late in the evening, ISIL captured Rutba. The next morning, ISIL forces captured the Al Jazeera Command Center in the town of Rasa and two new border crossings, one with Syrian and one with Jordan. On 23 June, government forces recaptured the Al-Waleed border crossing with Syria after militants retreated without resistance. The crossing with Jordan was also recaptured a day later. On 24 June, Syrian warplanes struck several areas in Western Iraq, killing at least 57 civilians, in what US officials claimed were strikes on ISIL positions. However, there had not been an official statement from the Syrian government. On 25 June, insurgents advanced towards the Haditha Dam, the second-largest in Iraq, and reached Burwana, on the eastern side of Haditha. Government forces engaged them in an attempt to halt their advance.  Aftermath ‚Äì autumn 2014 continued fighting  In late September and early October 2014, ISIL launched an offensive aimed at fully occupying Anbar province. Between 14 and 22 September, ISIL militants successfully laid siege to Saqlawiyah, resulting in its fall and the deaths of hundreds of soldiers. On 4 October, ISIL seized the town of Kubaysah following the capture of most of nearby Hit. On 13 October, the Iraqi army fully retreated from Hit. ISIL fighters looted three armored vehicles and at least five tanks. The fighting over Hit displaced up to 180,000 people, the U.N. estimated. On 23 October, ISIL militants seized the Iraqi village of Albu Nimr, after overcoming weeks of fierce resistance by its namesake Sunni tribe. Between 28 and 31 October, the militants from ISIL killed from 46 to 220 members of the Sunni tribes who opposed ISIL and which fought on the side of the Iraqi government against ISIL. On 2 November, Iraq's government said that ISIL militants killed 322 members of the Iraqi Sunni tribe and four days later a leader of the Albu Nimr tribe stated that 540 of its members had been killed by ISIL. On 10 November, 70 more members of the Albu Nimr tribe were executed by ISIL near Hit. Fighting broke out in the provincial capital Ramadi, on 21 November. On 23 November, an airstrike on the town of Hit killed civilians. A family of four were killed, including two children. It is unclear who carried out the strike.  Humanitarian consequences  There were over 380,000 internally displaced persons by mid- March 2014, 300,000 of whom were displaced mostly during the previous six weeks. According to the UNHCR, most people were displaced \\"due to insecurity around Fallujah and Ramadi\\" and had \\"fled to outlying communities in Anbar province,\\" though \\"60,000 persons have fled to more distant provinces.\\" There were a total of 336 killed and 1,562 injured, as of the same date.National Iraqi News Agency ‚Äì NINA  Response  The U.S. confirmed in January 2014 that to assist with the fight against groups in this area, they were speeding up supply of equipment to Iraq, including Hellfire missiles, ScanEagle UAVs, and Raven UAVs. Iran also offered support. Iraqi journalist Ali Nashmi suggested Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar were aiding ISIL. In June 2014, foreign involvement in Iraq became more direct as both an American- led intervention and a parallel Iranian intervention began.

Since 2013, he has been a play-by-play announcer for the Seattle Mariners Radio Network, working innings 3, 6 and 7 of each game. In addition, Goldsmith also does some of the lead play-by-play on selected games for Root Sports Northwest during the Mariners baseball season. Goldsmith also does selected baseball games, primarily on selected Saturdays for Fox Sports 1. In the off-season, he also provides play-by-play for college football on Sports USA Radio Network and Pac-12 basketball on Fox Sports 1. Goldsmith spent the early part of his childhood in Wichita, Kansas and he was a Royals fan. He attended his first game at Kauffman Stadium and he has stated that Bo Jackson, George Brett, and Bret Saberhagen were some of his favorite players as a child. When his family moved to St. Louis, Goldsmith became a Cardinals fan. Goldsmith has stated that legendary Cardinals announcer Jack Buck was a big influence to him and that he meant just as much to St. Louis as legendary Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus meant to Seattle. When Goldsmith was attending Principia College in Illinois working on a degree in history, he said that he woke up one morning, thinking that sportscasting may be a fun career. After graduating from Principia with his history degree, Goldsmith began taking classes at the Broadcast Center in St. Louis. Due to his history background, Goldsmith often found he was four years behind other students. It took 10 months for Goldsmith to graduate from The Broadcast Center. Upon graduation, Goldsmith began play-by-play broadcasting as an intern for Gateway Grizzlies games. The year was 2007, and Goldsmith would provide 2-innings of play-by- play for each home game. Goldsmith would follow this up with an unpaid internship with the Bourne Braves and then a similar position with the Portland Sea Dogs. In all cases, Goldsmith would be allowed to call select games or innings. During these stints, Goldsmith often found himself starving after calling games and realized he didn't even have a dollar to his name. After a brief time with the Sea Dogs, Goldsmith worked as the play-by-play voice for the Frisco RoughRiders. He would also serve as the team's manager of broadcasting and public relations. Goldsmith would remain with the RoughRiders for two seasons. During his time with the RoughRiders, Goldsmith proposed to his wife, Heather, and she accepted. In 2012, Goldsmith was hired to be the play-by-play voice for the Pawsox Radio Network. Goldsmith would provide play- by-play for every game that season, a first for himself. Goldsmith admits he joined the PawSox because of their history to produce big name announcers, but he knew that was no guarantee. Finally in 2013, Goldsmith joined the Mariners announcing team alongside Rick Rizzs. Goldsmith and his family now live in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. Goldsmith's play-by-play style is often attributed to an adaptation of Vin Scully, but Goldsmith attributes his style to his work with Eric Nadel and Dave O'Brien.

It plays as an \\"electrical multiplier\\" re-feeding the atrial fibrillation. One of the currently existing techniques to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) is based on thermo-coagulation of AFN. They are typically numerous at the pulmonary veins antrum. Several evidences have shown that the AFNs represent the true substrate of the AF. A large number of congenital and acquired conditions may cause this type of myocardium. The higher the number of AFNs the easier the initiation and the longer the AF maintenance. Despite being fundamental in the AF physiopathology the long-lasting AF depends on additional factors. The most important is the \\"Background Tachycardia\\" (BKT) which is a focal reentrant tachycardia caused by ‚ÄúFractal Micro-Reentry‚Äù. This special tachycardia exists even during AF, keeping the AFNs in a high frequency activation. This tachycardia has a unique mechanism of \\"protection\\" that prevents it from being reverted by the large amount of surrounding stimuli generated by the AF itself. Recent studies have shown that the BKT occurs within a more developed AFN or when there is a confluence of two or more of these elements. By using spectral analysis, it is possible to observe that the ‚ÄúFractal Micro-Reentry‚Äù phenomenon tends to occur depending on a critical amount of fibrillar myocardium. This is a small point in the atrial wall with numerous micro-reentries (in a three-dimensional model) inside the AFN, caused by ‚Äúcellular electrical disconnection‚Äù with progressive dichotomy (biological fractal phenomenon), even without the presence of fibrosis and without the need of major histological changes. By this way, it may be present even in normal hearts that explains the \\"Lone Atrial Fibrillation\\". This intense micro-electrical activity stimulates the surrounding atrial myocardium that accepts the activation according to its refractory period. This produces a slightly irregular focal tachycardia, known as \\"Background Tachycardia\\" responsible for AF maintenance with or without the contribution of many others AFNs or even of other BKT. The greater the number of these elements is the longer the AF may last even becoming permanent.

It was sold in 1651 to a cleric from Bergen, the magister Peder Nilss√∏n Lem, whose mother owned large forests and farms in the neighboring area. He then further extended his properties in the area. His great-grandson Hans S√∏rensen Lem was the first of the family who moved here and actually lived on Fr√∏nningen, when he moved here about 1740. The estate was owned by the Lem family until 1889, when it was taken over by Bjarnhard Rumohr, who was a relative of the last Lem.

Beebe discovered the opening pages of the manuscript in the Oxford University Bodleian Library written by Lewis. However, there is no evidence that Tolkien worked on the project. Originally, the identification of the manuscript to what is now known as Language and Human Nature was not evident to Beebe. It was some time later that he realized that the manuscript was the beginnings of the planned project between Lewis and Tolkien.http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/07/CSLewis070809.html Beebe relied on the help of other prominent C.

Dedicated to fostering and promoting free and ethical communication, the NCA promotes the widespread appreciation of the importance of communication in public and private life, the application of competent communication to improve the quality of human life and relationships, and the use of knowledge about communication to solve human problems. The National Communication Association is a nonprofit organization with the goal of promoting the study, criticism, research, teaching, in addition to the application of the artistic, humanistic and scientific principles of communication, Located in Washington, D.C., the organization selects the finest teachers and scholars whose vision and dedication shaped the mission, as well as the spirit of the organization, as leaders of the NCA. Beebe was president of the National Communication Association for the year 2013.

In addition, he spent time promoting the NCA to different countries, along with sharing the organization's current philosophy and goals. He added additional resources to the NCA website about internationalizing the communication discipline. Russia became a strategic location for promoting the values of the NCA, and during multiple trips there, Beebe became a leader in establishing communication studies programs. His efforts in stressing the importance of communication education helped, in collaboration with prominent Russian educators, to establish the creation of the Russian Communication Association. Beebe received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Training and Development Division of NCA in 2016.

Two years later, he won the US junior title in the 5000 meters. The next year, he won four junior national titles. Lehman won the senior 2012‚Äì13 National Championship in the 5000 meters and three titles at the junior championships. He then won a gold and a bronze medal at the World Junior Championships. In his senior year of high school, Lehman won the 10000 meters at the 2013‚Äì14 US Senior Championship/Olympic Trials, and took second place in the 5000 meters.

As of 2014, he was a senior at Oak Park and River Forest High School, where he was an honor student. He is now studying to become an engineer. During his time off, Lehman enjoys playing table tennis with friends. He volunteers regularly at the Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry, and is in the process of being certified as a speed skating coach. Lehman lists the Chicago Bears and Chicago Blackhawks as his favorite sports teams, and Bo Jackson as his sporting hero. He says his mother has been the most influential person in his life. Emery graduated cum laude from Marquette University majoring in Civil Engineering. Emery is now enrolled at Johns Hopkins University with a focus in structural engineering. Athletic career=Ice hockey= Lehman began playing ice hockey when he was six years old. As a sophomore in high school, he was selected as a conference All-Star playing defense for Oak Park and River Forest High School's (OPRF) varsity team. Describing Lehman's game, his coach remarked, \\"He delivers absolute monster hits ... He doesn't get knocked down, and he is always first to the puck\\". During the summer of 2013, Lehman hurt his ankle and the new OPRF hockey coach did not want to play him for fear of an injury jeopardizing Lehman's Olympic speed skating chances. Lehman thus took his senior year off from hockey. Emery Lehman reignited his career with Marquette‚Äôs ACHA Division II Hockey Team. He played defense for the team, scoring 2 goals and 10 assists. =Speed skating= At age nine, Lehman saw a poster claiming speed skating could help improve hockey skills. His mother persuaded Lehman to give it a try and he found he had a talent for the sport. Lehman was a 2008‚Äì09 short and long track speed skating national champion. In 2010, Emery began training with 2x Olympian Jeff Klaiber (who would coach Emery at the Olympic Games and through the 2015-16 season). In 2010-11, Emery won the 5000 meters at the 2010‚Äì11 United States Junior Championships, and was third in the All-Around. He participated in the 2010‚Äì11 World Junior Championships, placing 11th in the 5000 meters and 18th in the All-Around, at age 14. At the 2011‚Äì12 US Junior Championships, Lehman won the 1500 meter, 3000 meter, and 5000 meter distances, and also placed first in the All-Around. In his second year at the World Junior Championships, he was the youngest competitor in the field. At the senior National Championships that year, he placed sixth in the 1500 meter and 5000 meter events. He was fifth in the All- Around. At the 2012 World Cup trials, Lehman improved his personal best in the 5000 meters by ten seconds, to 6:28.56. Aged 16, he became the youngest skater ever to break 6:30. He finished second overall and qualified for the senior World Cup team. \\"I know I'm doing well, but I didn't know it would be this well,\\" Lehman remarked. At the 2012‚Äì13 US National Championships, he again improved his 5000-meter time, winning with a time of 6:27.06. He also took part in the 500, 1000, 1500, and 10000 meter events. He turned in personal best times in all four events and placed third in the 10000 meters. At the US Junior Championships, Lehman won the 1500, 3000, and 5000 meter events.

In November 2013, Lehman improved his own Junior National Record and came within 0.8 seconds of the World Junior record with a time of 6:19.87 in the 5000 meters. On December 27, Lehman, skating in the last of 10 pairs of athletes, completed the 5000 meters in a time of 6:25.90 at the US Olympic Trials. The time placed him second and qualified Lehman for his first Olympic Games. On January 1, 2014, Lehman took part in the 10000 meter race at the Olympic Trials. With three laps to go, he was four seconds behind 2010 Olympian Jonathan Kuck. Lehman took the lead with one lap to go. Kuck re-took the lead at the final turn, but Lehman edged him by seven hundredths of a second, about two blade lengths, at the finish line. \\"That was pretty insane,\\" remarked Lehman. \\"I didn't expect to be finishing anywhere close to Jonathan.\\" Lehman's time of 13:22.77 improved his personal best by seven seconds, and placed him first overall with one pairing ‚Äì Patrick Meek and Edwin Park ‚Äì remaining. Meek finished 0.39 seconds behind Lehman, taking third. Gary D'Amato of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called the race \\"perhaps the most thrilling race of the trials\\". At the Olympics, Lehman placed 16th in the 5000 meters with a time of 6:29.94. He was the top finishing American. Later, he placed 10th in the 10000 meters with a time of 13:28.67, far exceeding his personal best for a race at sea level. The exertion of the race caused him to vomit.

It holds materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa, i.e. notary and secretarial services from the 13th century, and after the fall of the Republic in 1808 documents created by the offices and institutions in the city of Dubrovnik during the French, Habsburg, Yugoslav and Croatian reign. The archive is important because the Republic of Ragusa had trade and political ties with all of the countries on the Mediterranean Sea and the interior of the southeastern part of the European continent; moreover, the documents and written records from that period represent very valuable historical material for the study of Croatian and Ragusan history, as well as the history of neighboring countries. History Dubrovnik archive was created as a result of notary and secretarial services in the 13th century, with archived materials located in various locales, such as the offices of the civil services, magistrates and the offices outside the city walls. Since the mid-fifteenth century materials were stored in the ornate cabinets in Rector's Palace, which still serve the same purpose. Another part of the archived materials consisted of the most important privileges and contracts concluded between the Republic and the neighboring rulers, religious dignitaries and cities with which Dubrovnik held political and trade relations, and was stored in the treasury of the Cathedral of St. Mary. In addition to these two archive locations, the Republic of Ragusa had a few more, but they have all been destroyed, such as the archive in the Archbishop's Palace which was destroyed during a fire in 1667. The bulk of the archived documents result from the operation of the offices of the city government, whose organization was completed during the 15th century. The existing state archives eventually formed into a separate institution, by various executive decisions of the highest bodies of the Republic of Ragusa. The term archive was first attested in 1599, and by 1760 archived documents from all locations was assembled in the Rector's Palace. Attestation of the term state archivist (publico archivista) dates since 1783. At that year the structure of the archive was recorded as divided into 14 series (861 volumes), while the unbound documents were arranged in 10 tables, by their initial letters from A through K. During the nineteenth and the twentieth century most of the archived material was taken away. In 1920 the Archive began operating as an independent institution, and in 1952 it relocated to the Sponza palace, where it is located to this day. During the Homeland War the archive building was heavily damaged in two attacks in 1991. Archive today Today's collection comprises 300 thematic units (fondovi) and collections, with more than 2.7 million pages of written documents, deeds and contracts. The oldest documents are the Bull of Pope Benedict VIII from 1022, and documents on founding the Benedictine Monastery on the island of Lokrum in 1023 ‚Äì both however preserved in much later copies. Major thematic units are those dating from the era of the Republic and French administration. The archive also contains records of offices and institutions who operated during the nineteenth and twentieth century within the city and its administrative area. In addition, the archive contains books from Dubrovnik and the island of Korƒçula up until 1860, the Collection of geographical maps as well as private family archives. Today, the Archive stores material from the Dubrovnik-Neretva County, functioning as an external archive service.

It consists of a bronze sculpture of Britannia standing on a pedestal, itself on a square base. The sculptor was Walter Gilbert and the sculpture was cast in the foundry of H. H. Martin and Company. It was unveiled in 1924. The names of those killed in both world wars and in later conflicts are inscribed on bronze plaques around the base, and there are further inscriptions on the paving around the memorial. It originally stood in Market Square and was moved to Municipal Square (which was renamed as Memorial Square on 11 November 2014) in 2006. The memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Following the First World War, the people of Crewe were slow to approve plans for the erection of a monument to the town's 700 soldiers who had fallen in the combat. The town already had a war memorial, the Boer War Memorial, which had been erected in Queen's Park in 1902‚Äì03. It was hoped that there could be a joint monument with the London and North Western Railway, the main employers and land owners in the town, but they already had their own monument at Euston station in London. Eventually the council's War Memorial Sub-Committee decided in 1922 to erect a monument in Market Square. This was to be financed by public subscription, and it was hoped that the railway company would contribute to the cost. Seven models were submitted for consideration, and the committee chose the one designed by Walter Gilbert depicting a figure of Britannia in bronze. Gilbert was the art director of the founders H. H. Martin and Company of Cheltenham, who were commissioned to cast the sculpture. The foundations for the memorial were laid in September 1923. It was unveiled on 14 June 1924 by General Sir Ian Hamilton, and dedicated by the Bishop of Chester. The total cost of the memorial was ¬£1,600, of which ¬£600 was given by the railway company. Following later wars and conflicts, plaques containing the names of those lost in the Second World War, the Falklands War, the Gulf War, and other conflicts were added. In 2004 Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council decided to make improvements to Market Square which would result in the memorial being moved. In November 2005 it was taken to the National Conservation Centre in Liverpool for restoration. The memorial was installed in Municipal Square in October 2006. Description Britannia in its former location in Market Square The figure of Britannia is in bronze, and it stands on a pedestal of Darley Dale limestone. This all stands on a large square base that was added in 2006. The figure is about high, and the pedestal is about in height. Britannia stands on chains, and holds a trident and a palm leaf. On the front of the pedestal is an inscription reading as follows. On the reverse, the inscription reads: The memorial is enclosed by paving inscribed with the following: Inscriptions on the paving And the paving in front of the memorial is inscribed: Appraisal The monument was designated as a Grade II listed building on 16 February 2005. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". In the reasons for listing, the citation states that war memorials are generally listable because of their cultural and historical significance. The Crewe memorial is unusual because it is also includes the names of civilians killed in the Second World War, and the servicemen killed in the Falklands and Gulf Wars. The monument is well designed with a striking figure of Britannia, and it has a prominent position in Memorial Square (formerly Municipal Square). In addition it uses high quality materials and craftsmanship. In the Buildings of England series it is described as the \\"highlight of the square\\".

It was erected in memory of local soldiers who had served or fallen in the Boer War, and consists of a bronze statue of soldier in uniform standing on a column on a stone plinth. The monument was unveiled in 1903, and contains plaques with the names of those who were lost in the war. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Shortly after the end of the Boer War in May 1902, the citizens of Crewe decided to erect a memorial to the soldiers from the town who had fallen in the conflict. It has been stated that a higher proportion of men from Crewe than in any other British town served in the war. A committee named the Crewe South African Volunteers' and Reservists' Memorial Fund Committee was established, which represented local volunteers rather than regular serving men. The committee asked the Crewe Borough Council for a site in Queen's Park, and the council gave them the most prominent position in the park. At the time a bandstand stood there, but this was demolished. The money for the memorial was raised by public subscription. It is thought that the London and North Western Railway Company gave nothing, although they had been generous to the town in other ways, including donating the park. The total donations amounted to ¬£1,050. The memorial was designed and made by Joseph Whitehead and Sons of Westminster. It was unveiled on 8 August 1903 by Lord Stalbridge, chairman of the railway company. Description The memorial consists of a bronze statue of a soldier dressed in the uniform of the period standing on a marble column on a stone pedestal. The whole memorial, including the statue, is about high. The soldier is standing to attention, holding a rifle, and dressed in what was known as \\"foreign service dress\\". This includes a slouch hat, a bandolier belt, a pouch, and a water bottle. The pedestal is in Aberdeen granite, and the column is in grey marble with a sandstone cap. The base is square, and carries a chamfered plinth with a pediment at the top on each side. From this rises a marble column with an Ionic cap. On each side of the plinth are bronze memorial plaques carrying lists of names. On the north pediment are the arms of the former borough, the motto \\"Never Behind\\", and the date 1899‚Äì1902. Originally at the base of the memorial was a bronze model of a locomotive named King Edward VII, which had been designed by F. W Webb. The model had been made by P. H. Lightfoot, and it stood on rails with 19 sleepers. The model was long and weighed over ten tons. It has since been removed and replaced by two stone lions.

History = 1932‚Äì1957 = In 1932, business magnate and philanthropist, Cap A. Tilles, donated land to the City of St. Louis for the purpose of converting the property into a municipal park.

By World War II, the first phase of the park was completed. = 1957‚Äìpresent = In March 1955, the Mayor and the Comptroller were authorized to sell Tilles Park. A statistical survey of the park was commissioned by the city, revealing the location of the park made the site more popular among county residents than city dwellers. The study found that more than 80 per cent of the people who used the park lived in the county. Another study showed that the city needed more open park space for its citizens. As a result, in 1956 the City of St. Louis decided to sell the park to developers. However, the St. Louis County Council stepped into the process. On April 17, 1957, in a 4‚Äì3 vote, the Republican members of the council voted to save the park from destruction, agreeing to pay $429,625 for the park. St. Louis then created a new Rosalie Tilles Memorial Park within the city limits, at The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.  Events  The park is a particularly popular destination for picnics. During December, Tilles Park is best known for its annual Winter Wonderland Light Show. The light show is an outdoor event, and consists of a series of elaborate structures, animals, and other Christmas themed decorations, constructed of electric lights. The show is open to both vehicular traffic and carriages, including for wedding engagement occasions. The show has been a mainstay of the park every winter since 1985.  See also  *C. A.

He worked with the physiologist, Angelo Mosso (1846-1910), which led to the first recording of human brain pulsations. Giacomini vein, a lower limb vein, and the band of Gaicomini, a band of uncus gyri parahippocampalis he discovered in 1882, and the Giacomini vertebrae are named after him. He contributed anthropological research regarding differences among human races, and also took an interest in teratology linked to the various cases. Early life He graduated in medicine and surgery in 1864 at the University of Turin. In 1866 he was a volunteer doctor in the Third Italian War of Independence and later in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In 1868, he became anatomical area at the Institute of the same university. In 1874, he succeeded Prof. Giovanni De Lorenzi as professor of anatomy after Lorenzi's death. In 1880, he became full professor. Career Giacomini vein At the beginning of his scientific career, he conducted clinical trials with the physiologist Angelo Mosso that led to the first recording of human brain pulsations. His early research includes studies on nerve abnormalities of the hand and the venous circulation of the lower limbs and blood of the upper limbs. The so-called vertebrae Giacomini (from the fifth to the eighth thoracic vertebra) are a dorsal limit of the heart. Since 1882, followed an in-depth study of brain morphology: describing the limbic lobe, a part of the hippocampal gyrus door today the name of band of Giacomini; deduced a complete work on the cerebral convolutions (1882). He conducted anthropological studies correlating the various convolutions of the brain to different races, demonstrating the great variety of brains. This research contrasted the beliefs of the anthropologist-criminologist Cesare Lombroso, who hypothesized that criminal activity is associated with atavistic morphology in the brain. He published a book his studies of the brains of three patients with microencephaly in 1885. In 1886, he first described an abnormality of the cranio-vertebral, called Os Odontoideum, and realized that this anomaly could alter the motility of the passage cranio-spinal, anticipating the concept of spinal instability. In 1871 he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Medicine. In 1876, he became the director of the Cabinet of Museum of Human Anatomy Luigi Rolando of Turin and in 1887 he became member of the Academy of Sciences of the same city. Post-mortem Giacomini wrote in his will that he wanted his skeleton and brain to be preserved after his death. He died of a stroke at the age of 58 and the preservation was performed two days after his death. His skeleton was exhibited along with his brain at the Museum of Human Anatomy Luigi Rolando of Torino. The brain at the feet of the skeleton was prepared with a conservative technique he had developed, which used a combination of chloride of zinc, alcohol, and glycerine. Giacomini presented his technique to the Royal Academy of Medicine of Turin on 7 June 1879. Sperino, who preserved his brain, found that his brain had a band of Giacomini.

Taking place in an alternate history, the story presents the further adventures of Dido Twite, an eleven-year-old Victorian tomboy, aboard a whaling ship and in Nantucket. The novel is the third in the Wolves Chronicles, a series of books set in a fictional 19th century in which the Stuart kings had not been ousted by William of Orange; a key plot driver (from Black Hearts in Battersea) is the efforts of \\"Hanoverians\\" to overthrow \\"King James III\\" and his heirs. Nightbirds on Nantucket is the second novel to feature Dido Twite and the first in which she is the main character. Plot Dido Twite awakens aboard the whaling ship The Sarah Casket, where she has been cared for in a coma by Nate Pardon, a young sailor who found her adrift in the Atlantic Ocean after the adventures of Black Hearts in Battersea. Dido is induced by the ship's captain to look after his daughter, Dutiful Penitence Casket, a neurotic eight-year-old who is travelling aboard the whaler. After drawing the girl out of her shell, Dido agrees to stay briefly on Nantucket to help \\"Pen's\\" transition to life with her Aunt Tribulation, who is to look after Pen while her father pursues his obsession, a mysterious pink whale.

While exploring the surrounding countryside, Dido encounters a mysterious but comic foreigner, who proves to be sighting a gigantic cannon intended to assassinate King James III by blowing up the royal palace; Mr. Slighcarp, the Sarah Casket's first mate, is part of the plot together with his sister Letitia, the villainess of The Wolves of Willoughby Chase.

During Tang  It is not known when Yao Yanzhang was born, but it is known that he was from Ru'nan (Ê±ùÂçó, in modern Zhumadian, Henan).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 72. The progress of his initial military career was not clear ‚Äî but, presumably, like Ma Yin, he was initially conscripted into the army of the late Tang Dynasty warlord Qin Zongquan, who controlled his home region, and then, after Qin declared himself emperor of a new state, was sent south on an expedition commanded by Qin's general Sun Ru; after Sun was defeated and killed by Yang Xingmi, Yao, presumably as was in the case with Ma, followed Liu Jianfeng, who headed southwest, eventually taking over Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), where Liu became its military governor.See in general History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 133. In 896, Liu was assassinated by his soldier Chen Zhan () after carrying out an affair with Chen's wife. The officers killed Chen and initially offered leadership to Liu's strategist Zhang Ji (). However, at the time that Zhang was about to accept leadership and enter the headquarters, his horse bit his leg. Believing this to be a bad omen, he instead recommended Ma to take over leadership. As Ma was then, under orders Liu previously ordered, attacking Shao Prefecture (ÈÇµÂ∑û, in modern Shaoyang, Hunan), which was then occupied by the officers Jiang Xun () and Deng Jichong () (who had previously rebelled against Liu's rule), Zhang sent emissaries to formally summon Ma back from the Shao campaign. Ma initially hesitated. Yao, who was then serving under Ma in the Shao campaign, persuaded him to accept, stating, \\"You, Lord, were effectively three people in the same flesh with General Liu and Commander Zhang. Now the General suffered disaster, and the Commander hurt his leg. The will of heaven and the wishes of the people are all on you; who can it be other than you, Lord?\\" Ma therefore left the officer Li Qiong () to continue to the Shao siege while he himself returned to Wu'an's capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan) to accept command of the circuit. (Zhang, after transferring command to Ma, himself assumed command of the Shao campaign,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. and captured the prefecture and Jiang in 897.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 898, it was under Yao's recommendation that Ma launched a campaign to try to capture Heng (Ë°°Â∑û, in modern Hengyang, Hunan), Yong (Ê∞∏Â∑û, in modern Yongzhou, Hunan), Dao (ÈÅìÂ∑û, in modern Yongzhou), Lian (ÈÄ£Â∑û, in modern Qingyuan, Guangdong), and Chen (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan) Prefectures. Yao also recommended Li Qiong as the commander of the operations, and Ma agreed. Ma's army was able to thereafter capture all five prefectures and take them under Ma's control. After the end of the campaign, Ma commissioned Yao as the prefect of Li Prefecture (ÊæßÂ∑û, in modern Changde, Hunan). Later, Ma made him the commander of the Jingjiang Circuit (ÈùúÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi) army.Ma took control of Jingjiang in 900, and commissioned Li Qiong as its military governor, so Yao's commission (which would be under Li's command) must have been in or after 900. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.  During Chu  As of 910 ‚Äî by which time Tang had fallen, and Ma Yin was effective the ruler of his own state (Chu, as its prince) that formally was a vassal to Tang's successor state Later Liang ‚Äî Yao Yanzhang was referred to as the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Ê©´Â∑û, in modern Nanning, Guangxi), in addition to being the commander of the Jingjiang army. That year (or slightly before), the warlord who controlled the Lingnan region, Liu Yin the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), had sent his brother Liu Yan to try to capture Rong (ÂÆπÂ∑û, in modern Yulin, Guangxi) and Gao (È´òÂ∑û, in modern Maoming, Guangxi) Prefectures, respectively, but Liu Yan was repelled by Pang Juzhao () the military governor of Ningyuan Circuit (ÂØßÈÅ†, headquartered at Rong Prefecture) and Liu Changlu () the defender of Gao. However, Liu Changlu believed that he eventually could not withstand another attack from Liu Yin, and therefore, in 910, wrote Ma and offered the prefecture to him. Ma sent Yao to welcome him and escort him to Chu territory. When Yao passed through Rong Prefecture, Pang's officer Mo Yanzhao () tried to persuade Pang to ambush him, but Pang refused; instead, Pang killed Mo and also surrendered his circuit to Ma. Ma made Yao the acting prefect of Rong, and Yao had soldiers escort Pang, Liu Changlu, and their families to Chu's capital Changsha.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 911, at Ma's request, the Later Liang emperor Zhu Huang commissioned Yao to be the deputy military governor of Ningyuan. However, that year, Liu Yan against attacked Rong. Ma sent the general Xu Dexun to try to aid Yao. But Yao, believing that the defenses could not hold, took the people of Rong and its treasury and returned to Changsha, allowing Liu Yin to take over Rong and Gao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. In 913, Yao commanded a Chu navy in attacking E Prefecture (ÈÑÇÂ∑û, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), then belonging to Chu's northeastern neighbor Wu. Wu sent the general L√º Shizao () to aid the E garrison. Before L√º could reach E, however, Yao withdrew.During this campaign, Yao was referred to as military governor of Ningyuan, but as he was later again referred to as the deputy military governor of Ningyuan, this particular reference appeared to be in error. In 921, Chu came under the attack of the non-Han tribe known as the \\"barbarians of Chen and Xu\\" (Ëæ∞ÊºµË†ª, i.e., from modern Huaihua, Hunan). Yao led an army against them and defeated them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 927 ‚Äî by which time Later Liang had fallen, and Ma was the vassal of the succeeding Later Tang ‚Äî the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan gave Ma the greater title of King of Chu. With that greater title, Ma established a governmental structure that mirrored the structure of the imperial government. He made Yao and Xu his chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Yao died in 939.

It has its origins in a collegiate built in 1004‚Äì09. From 1128 to 1783 it was a Premonstratensian monastery. For a while it was then a convent. Today it contains a girls' secondary school. The former abbey church, a magnificent late baroque building erected in 1726‚Äì40, is now the Basilica of Saint Margaret. Monastery history Henry V, Duke of Bavaria and his wife Luitgard erected a collegiate abbey of Augustinian Canons in his palace in Osterhofen in 1004‚Äì09. In 1017 the Emperor Henry II of Germany transferred the abbey to the diocese of Bamberg. In 1128 Bishop Otto of Bamberg brought men and women from the Premonstratensian Ursberg Abbey to the Osterhofen collegiate abbey. The abbey was endowed with extensive properties in the Wachau valley of Austria. The female branch of the abbey was probably extinct after 1200. In 1288 the head of the abbey become a provost. In 1414 the abbot was granted the right to wear the miter in liturgical celebrations. The abbey around 1700 by Michael Wening 1748 J.G.

There was a fire in the monastery in 1512. In 1701 a major fire caused by lightning destroyed the monastery. It was rebuilt in 1717‚Äì27. The former Gothic church also suffered great damage, and in 1726 it was decided to erect a new building. The fantastically ornamented monastery church was designed and built in 1726‚Äì40.

Maria Anna Sophia, the widow of the Elector of Bavaria, wished to give the noble-born nuns of the convent of Saint Anne in Munich a better endowment. The Pope agreed to assign the monastery and its properties to the sisters. The last of the Premonstratensians remained in the building until 1800. The church became the parish church in 1818. The convent sold the monastery building to the state in 1833. In 1858 the Sisters of Loreto moved into the building and founded a girls' secondary school. The school had six English lady teachers with twelve pupils. It was intended for girls \\"from better homes\\". In 1859 it was designated a school for middle class girls to learn housework, and from 1859 to 1873 as an institute for neglected children. In 1886 it became a college of education. Care of small children began in 1901. The school started accepting day pupils in 1913. A dilapidated part of the abbey's west wing was demolished in 1938. In 1942 the school was temporarily closed, opening again in 1946 as a 3-class middle school for girls. It became a 4-level secondary school in 1961, and a 6-level secondary school in 1999. The Realschule Damenstift (Convent Secondary School) was transferred to the Mary Ward Foundation of the Diocese of Passau in 2001. It is a government recognized secondary school for girls. Church The monastery church, built in colored stucco and marble, is one of the most lavishly decorated in Lower Bavaria. It was designed and built between 1726 and 1740 by the Munich architect and master-builder Johann Michael Fischer (1727‚Äì28) and the brothers Cosmas Damian Asam and Egid Quirin Asam. The nave is large, bright and spacious, with a high ceiling. The Asam brothers created a throne room in honor of God, a \\"theatrum sacrum\\". Cosmas Damian Asam, a brilliant painter, created the wonderful frescoes in the church. His brother Egid Quirin Asam filled the church interior with sculptures and ornaments, notably the impressive high altar. The altarpiece represents Saint Margaret set within a pagan environment, with a statue of Venus in a temple behind her. The church is considered a masterpiece of late baroque Bavarian church architecture. In 1983 the church became the Minor Basilica of St. Margaret, known as the Asambasilika.

Dating between the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the treasure is one of the most complete table services to survive from antiquity. This important hoard is now part of the British Museum's collection British Museum Collection Discovery and Ownership The hoard was uncovered by chance in a field near the village of Chaourse and had been deposited wrapped in cloth. Coins were also found with the treasure, the latest dating from the Gallic emperor Postumus. It appears that tableware was buried shortly afterwards, during the reign of Gallienus, although the context of the find remains obscure. While a few of the objects date to the 2nd century, most originate from the 3rd Century AD. The names of two people - Genialis and Cavarianus - are inscribed on some of the silver vessels. They were probably the original owners of the service, who for some reason decided to bury the hoard for safe-keeping. Six years after its discovery, the entire treasure was purchased by the British Museum. Description The Chaourse Treasure is made up of 39 objects in total, all of which are silver apart from five small vessels and a silvered bronze mirror. There are four large serving platters; one of which has the swastika in its central medallion, another has a gilded figure of the Roman god Mercury holding his caduceus flanked by a ram and a cockerel. In addition, there are plain silver drinking cups, various jugs, two large situlas one of which has an acanthus-scroll frieze, shallow plates, hemispherical bowls (one of which was used for washing hands), flanged and fluted bowls (some with engraved decoration of animals amid floral patterns), some mirrors, an ornate strainer with floral and geometric designs, a statuette of the deity Fortuna and a pepper-pot in the shape of an African slave-boy.

It is a meteorological disaster film about a rash of tornadoes striking the fictional town of Silverton, Oklahoma. The film was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 8, 2014 to mixed reviews from critics, with some comparing the film to Twister. Plot In the town of Silverton, Oklahoma, the local high school senior class is preparing for graduation. The high school's vice-principal, Gary Fuller, has asked his two sons, Trey and Donnie, to record messages from the seniors for a time capsule to be opened in 25 years. Elsewhere, Pete, a veteran storm chaser, has been attempting to intercept and film tornadoes using a Tornado Intercept Vehicle nicknamed Titus, but has come up short all year long. Upon learning of a major line of developing storms, the chasers decide to head for Silverton in hopes of filming tornadoes. After arriving in Silverton, the team discovers that the cell they had been chasing has dissipated, but the Silverton cell abruptly strengthens, resulting in a hailstorm and tornado. As the team films, the funnel shifts course and heads for the high school. At the high school, the weather suddenly sours. The students are marshaled into the school building. In the aftermath of the tornado, shaken students emerge from the damaged building to view the destruction, while Gary sets out to rescue his eldest son Donnie, who had gone to an abandoned paper mill to help his friend Kaitlyn with a project; both were subsequently trapped when the tornado brought the building down on them. As Pete's storm chase team stops in a small part of town, a tornado takes shape just as Gary and Trey arrive, destroying several buildings. Before the tornado dissipates Gary must save Pete's meteorologist, Allison Stone. Then, Pete's team agree to help Gary get to the paper mill. While en route, another round of tornadoes form and encircle Pete's team, in the process destroying a residential neighborhood and a car lot. An explosion turns one of the tornadoes into a firenado, which Jacob the cameraman, tries to film, only to be caught up in the storm and killed. This causes friction in the team, as Pete's concern seems to be more on collecting data than ensuring his team's safety. After recovering their vehicles, Allison leaves with Gary to continue their trip to the paper mill. At the mill, a water pipe abruptly breaks and begins to flood the hole in which the two students are trapped. Injured and at risk of drowning, the two record messages for their loved ones, then prepare for the worst. At the last minute, Gary and Allison arrive and successfully free them. In the skies above Silverton, a convergence of two large tornadoes results in a colossal EF-5 tornado that threatens to level the town. The town's citizens have taken shelter at the school, but Pete's team determines that the school's storm shelter will be inadequate. Unable to alert the school's staff with mobile devices, Pete's team rushes to the school. While citizens rush to board school buses, Pete and his team follow the storm, but the last school bus and a handful of cars are cut off from the retreat due to a downed transmission tower. The storm chasers and school refugees take cover in a storm drain at a construction site, but debris from the tornado damages one of the storm grates, compromising the shelter. In an attempt to save lives, Pete hands over his research hard drives to Gary, then sacrifices himself by leaving the shelter to move Titus down to the storm grate, to use the vehicle to anchor the storm grate to the concrete face. Titus's equipment proves unable to anchor the vehicle to the ground, and the tornado picks up the vehicle. From the camera turret aboard Titus, Pete observes the funnel of the tornado as the vehicle is lifted above the clouds, before then crashing to the ground, killing him and wrecking Titus. Shortly thereafter, the EF-5 tornado dissipates. In the aftermath of the tornado outbreak, the townspeople begin to clean up and rebuild. As Gary's sons complete their time capsule film, many of those they interview express a newfound appreciation for their lives. Allison praises Pete's sacrifice and dedication to science. The last footage shows two local daredevils Donk and Reevis, who were sucked up by the tornado, to have survived the storm.

Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 156 reviews and an average rating of 4.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Clumsily scripted and populated with forgettable characters, Into the Storm has little to offer beyond its admittedly thrilling special effects.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Varietys Scott Foundas called the film a feature- length VFX demo reel that makes one pine for the glory days of Jan de Bont. Scott Mendelson of Forbes reviewed the film and commented that the film is visually dazzling and mostly successful in updating the disaster film for the YouTube age. He said, \\"The special effects work is basically flawless, and you absolutely get what you arguably came to see. You want big-screen images of insanely large-scale tornadoes and big-scale devastation and disaster carnage? Into the Storm gives you plenty of rock-solid disaster porn.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official Website  * Category:2014 films Category:2010s disaster films Category:American films Category:American disaster films Category:English-language films Category:Films about tornadoes Category:Films set in Oklahoma Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:Films directed by Steven Quale Category:Films scored by Brian Tyler Category:Found footage films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Village Roadshow Pictures films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films shot in Detroit ","title":"Into the Storm (2014 film)"},{"id":"41548017","text":"Koilada () is a village and a community of the Kozani municipality.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Before the 2011 local government reform it was part of the municipality of Ellispontos, of which it was a municipal district.

History  In 1913, Hadsten Stationsby had grown to a population of 1350.(1915‚Äì1930) Johannes Br√∏ndum-Nielsen. Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon, p. 631. A large group of citizens were convinced that a city of that size must have a church. Until then, the city was served by two small churches, (Hadsten was divided into two parishes, divided by the river.) both located a few kilometres from the city. From 1900, the churches was supplemented by an Inner Mission community.Jensen, B√∏rge (1994). Hadsten i 300 √•r, p. 195. The famous Hadsten-doctor, F.B. Larsen, bought in 1898 a farm in the small village Vinterslev. From the farm, he donated a piece of land for the church near the station. The citizens had in 1912 collected 15.000 kr. (2013: 164,821 USD)Old Money. Danish conversion website. Retrieved 4 January 2013. In the municipality, the city council sent an application to the Minister of Church in 1914 to fund the building. The Ministry rejected the city council that same year, with the reason, that they didn't see the possibility of providing financial support in near future.Jensen, B√∏rge (1994). Hadsten i 300 √•r, p. 196. The city council did not give up. The same year they received permission for church services in new built Christian Center (Missionshus). 22 July 1916, the city council sent the second application to the Minister of Church. This time, it was approved. The well known architect, Hack Kampmann, presented a proposal in old architectural style. The proposal was thwarted by the rising cost of materials, because of World War I.

He was born in New York City on August 16, 1886, but his family moved to Haworth, New Jersey, three years later.Potter, Beth. \\"Haworth's Notable Characters\\", Haworth, New Jersey. Accessed December 4, 2014. Armin Lobeck was 21 years old when he entered Columbia University in 1907 because he dropped out of high school to care for his family when his father became ill. In his senior year at Columbia, he took Master's level courses in botany and architecture, and received his AB degree in 1911 and his Master's Degree in 1913. After working as a teacher at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy from 1911-1914, he returned to Columbia University where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1917. At the beginning of World War I, he enlisted in the US Army and was sent to Fort Dix, NJ, but he was soon transferred to the United States Department of State. He was assigned to The Inquiry, an organization under Colonel E. M. House to prepare for making peace at the end of the war. While there, he received a reasonable salary of $183.00 a month.\\"Men of the Inquiry: Armin Lobeck.\\" At the war's end, he was assigned to the Geography Section of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. His duty was to prepare physiographic maps of problem areas, such as the Balkans, the Istria, Albania, and other regions. Armin Lobeck accepted a position as associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and worked there for 10 years from 1919-1929. His first physiographic map of importance was published as the large scale \\"Physiographic Diagram of the United States\\", published by the Nystrom Company in 1921. In 1929 he returned to Columbia University as full Professor of Geology, where he remained until his retirement in 1954. During World War II, Dr. Lobeck was employed by the Military Intelligence Service (United States), G-2, on the General Staff of the United States Army, and the Army Map Service. There he prepared sketch maps for the invasion of North Africa. He also prepared a series of European maps in sections for the use of the staff, that were combined after the war into a large physiographic map of Europe. Armin Lobeck died in Englewood, New Jersey, at the age of 71 years on April 26, 1958. Accomplishments Dr. Lobeck was awarded the Neil Miner Medal by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers in 1956. Dr. Lobeck and his wife were active in the affairs at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. He became a Director of the Camp Meeting Association in 1950, and later he was elected Vice President of the Association in 1956.Smith, Guy-Harold. 1959. \\"Armin Kohl Lobeck, Geomorphologist and Landscape Artist, 1886-1958.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

On C: *C, C, D, D, E, F and *F, G, G, A, A, B. This is the first of the six hexachords identified by Milton Babbitt as all-combinatorial source sets, a \\"source set\\" being \\"a set considered only in terms of the content of its hexachords, and whose combinatorial characteristics are independent of the ordering imposed on this content\\" . In the larger context of thirty-five source hexachords catalogued by Donald Martino, it is designated \\"Type A\\" .

The two clubs' position came about after the WRU rejected requests by the club to pursue changes to the league structure in Welsh club rugby and in particular to set up a cross-border league involving other clubs in Britain, and the two clubs refused to sign up to a loyalty agreement with the WRU committing them to the current league setup. The two clubs were removed from Wales' entry into the 1998‚Äì99 Heineken Cup and would later be fined ¬£150,000 each by the WRU for three breaches of their regulations. The English Rugby Football Union (RFU) didn't sanction the rebel games, but were accused by rugby union's world governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB), of not doing enough to prevent the fixtures taking place and had ¬£60,000 of IRB funding withdrawn. At the end of the season, an agreement was reached between the two clubs and the Welsh Rugby Union that allowed for their return to the Welsh Premier Division, with clauses that would allow them to leave the Welsh league and join the English Premiership in the event a cross-border British league was not set-up by the 2000-01 season. Despite this league not coming to fruition, the two clubs did not exercise their right to leave and remained in the Welsh structure. Background Cardiff RFC and Swansea RFC had both been members of the Welsh Premier Division since the formation of the league system in Wales in September 1990. In August 1995, rugby union became a professional game, which allowed payment or benefits to be made to players. Following the change to professionalism, several of the clubs playing in the Premier Division began experiencing financial difficulties. Llanelli RFC sold their ground, Stradey Park, to the WRU in 1997 to raise money, Neath RFC were taken over by a WRU- owned subsidiary Gower Park Ltd. in May 1998. Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC were also in financial difficulties. Against this backdrop, the WRU wished to have clubs in the Premier Division sign 10-year loyalty agreements. These four page agreements would see the clubs assured of their places in the top-flight of the league system for the duration of the agreement, in exchange for their commitment to remain playing in the league system. However, both Swansea and Cardiff saw insufficient returns available from the Welsh league, and refused to sign up to the loyalty agreements, instead suggesting the setup of a British league involving four clubs from Wales, the clubs that comprised the top division in England and two Scottish regional sides; Edinburgh and Glasgow. This proposal was supported by both the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the clubs that comprised the top two divisions in England, but was rejected by the WRU, owing to ongoing legal action between the RFU and English clubs over commercial rights, and the ongoing legal action taken by Cardiff. The WRU reiterated their requirement that Cardiff and Swansea sign up to the loyalty agreement in order to continue participating in the Premier Division and the European Cup. Confirmation of Breakaway Eight days before the 1998‚Äì99 Premier Division was due to start, Swansea and Cardiff released a statement that confirmed their position that they would play friendly matches against English clubs rather than participate in the Welsh Premier Division. The two clubs had organised to play each of the 14 teams of the English Premiership on a home and away basis, with the matches scheduled alongside the Premiership so that each weekend of the season, 12 of the English clubs played league matches while two clubs would have a free weekend in the league to allow them to play the two Welsh clubs. The two clubs sold the television coverage rights to the matches themselves, with the BBC acquiring the rights. By contrast, the rights to cover the Premier Division fixtures were held by HTV and S4C. At a general committee meeting held on 24 August; the WRU formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the Premier Division and replaced them. Cardiff's position was given to Newport RFC, who had been relegated at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season and Swansea's to Aberavon RFC, who had finished second in Division One, the tier below the Premier Division. The WRU confirmed their position that any matches Cardiff and Swansea played against opponents from England would not be sanctioned. The RFU also refused to sanction the friendly matches, which meant neither union would provide match officials for the games, resulting in retired and junior officials being called upon for these games. Rebel games Initially, the friendly games were contested as promised between full-strength teams. Cardiff's first home fixture came against Saracens, with over 10,000 fans attending Cardiff Arms Park to watch Cardiff defeat Saracens by 40-19. The quality of opposition continued to remain high until the end of the year, however as the season progressed into 1999, the demands of the Premiership season combined with the loss of players to international callups during the 1999 Five Nations tournament led to reduced strength sides being fielded by some Premiership clubs, and blowout scores being recorded as a result, including Cardiff beating a development Richmond side by 96-28 in May. By comparison, Richmond had won the December encounter between the two sides 35-28. In December 1998, the WRU announced it would be fining Cardiff and Swansea a total of ¬£150,000 each for several breaches of their regulations. The regulations breached were playing in unsanctioned matches, negotiating their own television contracts and playing in matches with unapproved officials, with the first two offences carrying fines of ¬£60,000 and the third resulting in a ¬£30,000 fine. The WRU imposed a deadline of the end of February to pay the fines by, however both clubs announced they would refuse to pay. Despite not formally sanctioning the games, the English RFU were accused by the governing body of rugby union, the International Rugby Board (IRB) of not doing enough to prevent the fixtures from taking place. A day after the WRU had fined the two Welsh clubs, the IRB announced that the RFU would miss out on ¬£60,000 of funding that they were due to receive from the IRB Trust, effectively imposing a fine on the union for not taking action. Despite not competing in either the Welsh Premier Division or in the European Cup, both Cardiff and Swansea participated in the WRU organised Challenge Cup competition, which at the time was branded under the name of its sponsor Swalec. Cardiff chief executive Gareth Davies believed that the reason for their inclusion was to appease the sponsor who might otherwise had withdrawn their backing. This competition saw them compete against other Welsh clubs, and as such, the games took on increased importance as Cardiff and Swansea tried to justify their improved standard following cross-border competition as compared to the clubs that had remained in the Welsh league system. Both teams reached the semi-finals where Cardiff were drawn against Llanelli RFC and Swansea against Cross Keys RFC. In the week prior to the game, Cardiff chairman Peter Thomas spoke to the players following a training session, where he emphasised the importance of winning the game, describing it as \\"the biggest game in the club's history\\". Cardiff went on to lose the game. In the other semi-final Swansea recorded a convincing win over Cross Keys. Swansea then beat Llanelli in the final to win the cup. Reconciliation An emergency meeting was held by the WRU in May 1999, at which the two sides came to an agreement that would see Cardiff and Swansea return to the Welsh Premier Division for the 1999-2000 season, with an agreement that both sides could join the English Premiership for the 2000-01 season in the event that a British league had not been set up. Also as part of the agreement, Cardiff and Swansea signed loyalty agreements with the WRU scheduled to run for the remaining eight years and were also nominated as two of the Welsh representatives in the 1999-2000 European Cup, despite the positions usually being awarded based upon Welsh Premier Division league positions. Cardiff and Swansea's inclusion came at the expense of Ebbw Vale RFC, who would normally have been nominated based on their 1998‚Äì99 league position. Legacy A British league wasn't set up for the 2000-01 season, however neither Cardiff nor Swansea entered the English Premiership. The two Scottish District sides joined the Welsh sides in forming a Welsh-Scottish League from the 1999 - 2000 season. For the 2001-02 season, the Celtic League ran alongside the 2001-02 Welsh-Scottish League, involving sides from Wales, Scotland and Ireland in a pool/knockout format competition. The 10 year loyalty agreements, which was scheduled to run through to August 2007 were torn up by the WRU in 2003 to allow introduction of regional rugby. With the creation of the five regional teams from Wales, the Celtic League was changed into a traditional double round-robin league.

St Roberts Church website: history Retrieved 5 January 2014 Edmund Earl of Cornwall gave the church to St Robert's Priory in 1278. The present church was built before May 1318, when it was \\"said to have been damaged by a Scottish raiding party\\" who visited Pannal before or after attacking Knaresborough Castle, and left the village after stealing cattle and sacking and burning the church. The chancel was rebuilt in 1319 by monks from Knaresborough Priory. They belonged to the Trinitarian Order of St Robert of Knaresborough, and it may have been this event which inspired the rededication of the church. The priory received the church and its income from Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall in 1319, and it was consecrated in 1348. The priory was dissolved in 1539, and Pannal Church became Protestant. In 1549 the Chantry of St James, Pannal, was dissolved. There are parish register transcripts for Pannal, dating from the 16th century onwards, at the Borthwick Institute for Archives.Borthwick Institute for Archives: location of St Roberts parish register transcripts Retrieved 5 January 2014 Until the 19th century, this parish church was the village's civic and judicial centre. The parish chest held civil documents, and the vicar and warden held the keys. The church dispensed welfare monies and set up workhouses and poorhouses. The parish supported the village constable, and until the 1960s the old village stocks could be seen by the churchyard gate. In 1943 the 4th Harrogate (St Robert's) scout troop was located at the church.1942 Harrogate and Nidderdale Scouts Retrieved 5 January 2014 =St Robert= Pannal Church is the only one in the United Kingdom dedicated to Robert of Knaresborough (1170‚Äì1218). He was born in York, the son of Touk Flower. He was ordained subdeacon and served at Newminster Abbey for four and a half months. He returned to Knaresborough to become a hermit. His patron Juliana gave him the chapel of St Hilda at Rudfarlington. He became known as a holy man and lived in various places, including Spofforth near Pannal. He cared for the poor, and received support from King John, Sir William de Stuteville the son of Robert III de Stuteville, and his brother who became the Mayor of York.Victoria County History: Friars of Knaresborough Retrieved 5 January 2014 Structure The floodlit church The church was listed as Grade II*, number 1149449, on 18 July 1949 on the grounds that the tower and chancel constitute a medieval element of the dressed and coursed sandstone structure. It has graded-slate roofs. The chancel is lower and narrower than the nave, and was built in the 14th century, the east window tracery dates from 1350. Parts of the chancel may be remnants of the earlier 13th-century stone church. The tower was added at the west end in the 15th or 16th century. During the ministry of William Raper and after becoming derelict, the nave was rebuilt in 1772 with Georgian elements in the churchwarden style, including \\"rounded Georgian windows with amber glass, a plaster ceiling with a decorated cornice, box pews and a three-decker pulpit (all now gone).See image of round-headed Georgian windows: :File:Tarleton St Marys Church Windows.jpg It was restored during the ministry of Mark Rowntree in 1882 to 1884 while the church was closed. He replaced the box pews with pitch pine ones and removed the three- decker pulpit. He lowered the nave floor by and raised the chancel floor and ceiling to create the Bentley's burial crypt below. It was probably at this time that the present arch-braced truss ceiling was installed. Before Rowntree's work, the nave floor was higher than those of the tower and chancel. The same section was remodelled again in 1929 when the ceiling and some oak roof beams were replaced, and electric light installed. In 1930 perpendicular windows replaced the Georgian ones. In 1934 the church acquired an organ loft in the tower arch and the ground floor of the tower became a vestry.Church leaflet: The Parish Church of St Robert of Knaresborough Pannal: A mini guide On the south side a porch and choir vestry were added in 1952, the glazed and polygonal chapter house was built in 1977 and the parish meeting rooms and kitchen in 1988 or 1999.

On different levels it has three interior floors consisting of the vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle floor levels are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal buttresses run up the bottom two stages and half of the top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west door, in a \\"segmental-pointed\\" arch with \\"broad chamfer\\" is in the lower exterior stage. The three-light window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an embattled parapet. The tower is floodlit at night. The nave was rebuilt in the Georgian era, and the visual evidence of this is the \\"rusticated quoins and the rusticated surround of a former blind north doorway.\\" The two-light windows in perpendicular style were added in 1929, the south-east one having been shortened when the chapter house was added. The chancel is in decorated style. It has four windows, its east window having three lights and reticulated tracery, plus an ogee-headed priest's doorway on the south side. One of the chancel's stained glass windows is from Knaresborough Priory.Mentioned in William Grainge, Harrogate and the Forest of Knaresborough, 1871 It is a small window in the point of an arch, showing a coat of arms with two oaks above a red and blue Trinitarian cross. The oaks may commemorate the fact that \\"in August 1255 the king gave three oaks to the friars of the Holy Trinity for the fabric of the church of St Robert,\\". Pannal historian Anne Smith suggests that the object between the oaks is the gateway to the Priory. On the south-west and north-west buttresses of the tower are ancient and almost-illegible carvings about across, and about from the ground. They may be consecration crosses, following the tradition in which Anglican bishops have anointed each corner of the church with chrism as part of the consecration ritual, then commemorative crosses were placed at the same points. At first sight the carvings appear to be Tudor roses or the fleurs-de- lis used by English monarchs from the 14th to 18th century, but the raised \\"petals\\" may be the gaps between the curved arms of the deeply engraved cross.See images: :File:Consecration cross St Roberts 037a.jpg, :File:Consecration cross St Roberts 041.jpg, :File:StRoberts 038.jpg Church interior Piscina and top of sedilia =Sanctuary and chancel= In the walls of the sanctuary are two corbels which have been re-set, and they may indicate the use of a Lenten veil. On the sanctuary floor are early 20th century memorial mosaics, with a crypt below. The chancel contains a 14th century piscina with an ogee opening, but the piscina and the top of the sedilia are low on the wall to the right of the altar, indicating a raising of the stone floor which has 17th and 19th century ledgers. It has scribed render walls. The roof was restored in 1884, and is arch-braced with 4.5 bays. =Nave= The \\"tie-beam roof on corbelled brackets, with cusped arcading over the beams\\" of the nave has been rebuilt and remodelled several times, but may perhaps be mainly attributed to the 19th century works. The walls are plastered and there are floorboards under the pews. Between the nave and the tower's ground-floor vestry is an organ, built against the tower arch. English Heritage describes the fixtures in the nave and chancel as follows: > The font, probably of 1772, is of polished marble and of unusual oval shape. > Its wooden canopy has a finial surmounted by a dove. The C19 pulpit is > polygonal Perpendicular with a figure of the Good Shepherd. Pews are mainly > C19 and their ends have notional poppy heads. Choir stalls have ends with > scrolled foliage to the tops, and Gothic blind-panelled frontals. The C19 > altar table incorporates C17 panels. The east window shows the Nativity > (1883). There are C19 and C20 memorial tablets, and a memorial tablet to the > Symeson/Simpson family set up after the death of William Simpson in 1886, by > Day of Knaresborough.English Heritage listing details 1149449 The tower and chancel arches are on polygonal shafts and built in 1929. The font is made of limestone from Derbyshire, and the stone contains small fossils. The church accounts of 1686 refer to \\"putting a loop ring\\" on the font for two pennies; the loop fitted on the rim of this rare oval font is still in situ, dating it to before that date. The church leaflet mentions legends of its origin in Fountains Abbey or in a mansion where the font was once a wine cooler. Contrary to the above listing description, it is the wooden cover and not the font which was made in 1772 and restored in 1975. The brass eagle lectern was presented to the church in 1875. The pulpit, presented to the church in 1955, is the work of Norval Paxton; this is possibly architect Norval Paxton of Tadcaster who designed the church hall (dedicated in 1947 and now demolished) at Foundry Mill Street in Seacroft. The east window in the chancel was presented by Eliza Bentley in 1883.English Heritage: A survey and gazetteer of places of worship 1900‚Äì2005 Retrieved 9 January 2014 Image:St Roberts Interior 035.jpgOval font Image:St Roberts Interior 027.jpgPulpit by Norval Paxton Image:St Roberts Interior 029.jpgChoir stall carving Image:St Roberts Interior 024.jpgAltar table Image:St Roberts Interior 030.jpgEast window =Tower= There is no public access to the interior of the tower. It contains three floors, a very narrow stone spiral staircase on the south side, and a roof area with a trapdoor. The staircase has steep risers and is naturally lit when the sun is in the southern quarter by three very small glazed windows, however at other times all or part of the staircase is pitch dark. The ground floor contains the vestry with its own loft above, incorporating the west window which is inaccessible to visitors. The middle floor is the clock chamber, containing a turret clock mechanism serving the three blue clock faces of the tower, and chiming on the hour. It probably dates from the 19th century, and has been wound and maintained for generations by the local Shutt family. In recent years the cranks and clock weights were removed to Pannal Hall (where they were lost) and the clock and chime mechanism is now driven by two electric motors. The clock employs a clapper mechanism on the largest bell to chime the hour. The top floor of the tower is the bell chamber. Two of the three hung and functioning bells are dated 1669 and 1703, both re-cast by Samuel Smith of York. This might imply that the smallest bell could be contemporary with the 15th to 16th century tower.

Churchyard and environs Three stone cottages and a forge used to stand in front of the church; these were demolished in 1970 and the stone was re-used to build the church's present car-park wall. The gateposts leading from the car-park to the churchyard were once reputedly the posts for the original village stocks, which have been replaced with a replica.See images: :File:St Roberts, stocks001.jpg and :File:Pannal Church 001.jpg The churchyard was enlarged by half an acre on the south side with land given by Eliza Bentley in 1868.

The first in 1271 was William de Sancto Martino, listed as Monsigneur Martyn of St Clements Priory. There followed on 5 January 1311 Thomas of Skelthorpe, a brother of Knaresborough Priory.

The 16th century begins with brother Henry Bell in 1511, then brother John Godbehere in 1515, brother Percival Dibbs in 1524 and Prior Will Lambert in 1535. St Roberts Priory was dissolved in 1539, and in 1549 the Chantry of St James, Pannal, was dissolved. In 1677 and 1683 the ministers were William Cheldrey and William Parsons, beginning the Protestant era of the church. These were followed by a number of curates: Thomas Green 1694, Christopher Jackson, 1696 and John Wright in 1699 (d.1707). It is not known whether there was then another gap with no vicar. The next curate was Lister Simondson in 1728.Descendants of William Norfolk Retrieved 5 January 2014 The same Reverend Lister Simondson was \\"instituted vicar on the presentation of the king\\" George II in 1745.

Irakli Gamrekeli(; 5 May 1894 ‚Äì 10 May 1943) was a Georgian set designer and one of the founders of Georgian avant-garde stage design. Gamrekeli was born in Gori. His talent was discovered during an exhibition of his work by the leading Georgian theatre director Kote Marjanishvili, who was impressed by Gamrekeli's illustrations for Oscar Wilde's Salome. From 1922 to 1943 Gamrekeli worked with the Rustaveli Theatre, first under Marjanishvili and later under Sandro Akhmeteli, where he designed 50 productions, including William Shakespeare's Hamlet (1925), Sandro Shanshiashvili's Anzor (1928), Friedrich Schiller's The Robbers (1933) and Shakespeare's Othello (1937). Gamrekeli's picturesque designs, noted for their abstract geometric constructions and spacious but sparsely furnished dimensions, helped determine the monumental and heroic style characteristic of the Rustaveli Theatre. Later in his career, in the 1930s and 1940s, Gamrekeli worked for the Theatre of Opera and Ballet and the Griboyedov Russian Drama Theatre in Tbilisi. He also collaborated with the Georgian state film studio in Tbilisi: in 1929, he and fellow artist Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi worked on Kote Mikaberidze's ground-breaking expressionist film My Grandmother, but the film was banned by the Soviet censors for decades. Gamrekeli was also the art director of the films Arsena (1937) and Giorgi Saakadze (1942‚Äì1943). Besides stage design, Gamrekeli was also in 1924 chosen to design the layout of H2SO4 ‚Äì the first and only publication of the eponymous Georgian avant-garde group of artists to which he belonged. He was awarded the title of Honored Artist of Georgia and the Order of the Badge of Honor. He died in Tbilisi in 1943 and was buried at the Didube Pantheon.

Shuey felt that the name was ‚Äúsomewhat inappropriately‚Äù proposed by Pyle in 1981 for Euphyes berryi, a species ‚Äúnot endemic to Florida and which is found in open wetlands, not swamps.‚Äù  Description  Wingspan of adult males is 36‚Äì38 mm, and of adult females is 38‚Äì42 mm. Body and head are mostly brownish to fulvous (a dull brownish yellow), antennae black above and fulvous beneath. Male wings are mostly bright fulvous upperside, and darker or brownish fulvous underside, with darker brown borders and some spot patterns. Female wings are mostly black brown upper side, with dark fulvous undersides. Hindwing undersides of both genders distinctly show paler, yellowish fulvous veins. Identification of the species is considered difficult, with individuals of Euphyes dion, Euphyes byssus and probably other skippers that sometimes lack normal hindwing patterns closely resembling Euphyes berryi.  Range and habitat  E. berryi was historically found in outer coastal plains from North Carolina (north to Dare County) to southern Florida (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida). It may be extirpated from portions of its historic range. Its habitat consists of wet areas near ponds and swamps, including wet prairies, marshes, and savannas with pitcher plants.  Ecology  The larvae of E. berryi feed on various sedges, probably one or more species of Carex. Adults feed on nectar from various flowers, including pickerelweed (genus Pontederia). The larvae overwinter, and adults have been reported from March to October, probably from two broods.  Status  E. berryi‚Äôs NatureServe conservation status, last reviewed in 2015, is G1G3, a range from critically imperiled to vulnerable due to significant uncertainty and limited knowledge of its habitat. The rounded average global threat status is G2 (imperiled).  Etymology  E. berryi was named by Ernest Layton Bell ‚Äúfor Mr. Dean F. Berry of Orlando, Florida, who collected most of the specimens.‚Äù Bell himself was an amateur but active entomologist and taxonomist.

A strong sense of the community within the show never detracted from the individual journeys the characters went on...an excellent drama.\\" In May 2015, it was announced the show had been longlisted for the Best Family Drama award at the 2015 TV Choice Awards. The show made the shortlist but lost out to Call the Midwife. The show won the Best Drama award at the 2015 Inside Soap Awards, beating competitors Holby City and Waterloo Road.

Following the broadcast of the first standalone episode on 15 November 2014, Duncan Lindsay of Metro expressed his opinions on the episode, saying that \\"the storyline itself wasn't bad at all\\", however the episode was \\"let down by the choice of characters involved\\". Lindsay felt that the lead character of the episode, Lily Chao, was \\"not a likeable enough character\\" to lead the murder mystery storyline. Lindsay then went on to say that he felt the episode would have been better if it had focused on the \\"more personable character\\" in the show. Show scriptwriter Mark Catley, who wrote the third standalone episode \\"Holby Sin City\\", received negative criticism about the episode from fans, expressing their displeasure at the episode. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy labelled \\"Holby Sin City\\" as \\"one of the show's most divisive episodes ever.\\" The show faced further criticism following the broadcast of episode forty-three, which featured a patient crash his lorry after blacking out while driving.

The storyline was compared to the real-life 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash, with four similarities made between the fictional crash and the real-life crash, and described as \\"deeply unfortunate\\". A BBC spokesperson said, \\"We would never knowingly imitate a real life event. Parallels can be drawn with many of our storylines. However, with the amount of stories that we tell of characters in extreme situations, it is hard to avoid dramatising situations that can occasionally be reminiscent of real life events\\". Casualty two-parter finale episodes were described by the Daily Mirror as potentially being \\"the most dramatic episodes in three decades\\". After the airing of episode forty-six, Irish Examiner said that fans had been \\"left reeling\\" and were \\"on the edge\\" following the show's dramatic cliffhanger.

This series consisted of 43 episodes. As the show built towards its thirtieth anniversary in 2016, Hossington revealed in an interview that the special episode will do something \\"no other show has done before.\\" In the interview, Hossington said: \\"I'm very keen to make it a big event! We spoke about live episodes and things like that, but we decided that none of those things were satisfying as they've all been done. What we're doing, no other show has done before ...\\" Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary. It was later revealed by Charles Venn in an interview with What's on TV on 8 June 2016, that his character, Nurse Jacob Masters, would be at the forefront of the anniversary episode. Venn said in the interview his character would play \\"an integral part\\" in the 110-minute special anniversary episode. Venn also went on to say that the cast and crew brand the thirtieth anniversary episode Casualty: The Movie. In a more recent interview with Hossington, she revealed that the current ongoing storyline involving Ethan and Cal was pitched by co-creator Paul Unwin. The storyline saw Cal struggle to come to terms with the revelation that he and Ethan are adopted. This prompted Cal to go searching for his birth mother along with Charlie in episode sixteen where another secret was exposed when Cal found out his birth mother, Emilie Groome (Carol Royle) had Huntington's disease.Sources:  The episode itself attracted an audience of 6.88 million viewers. (Change the 'Year' field to 2015, then the 'Month' field to December, then find in the 'Week' field 14 Dec ‚Äì 20 Dec) Casualty aired one of its biggest storylines ever in the summer of 2016, as the show celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. August 2016 saw the show air 'an enormous stunt'. Hossington also revealed in an earlier interview in 2015 that, as part of the thirtieth anniversary, 'the hospital itself will be in jeopardy.' Kent commented on the storyline saying: 'We'll bring in some Holby characters, plus some other faces from the past and something major will happen to one of our lead characters that will take them a very long time to recover from ‚Äî the ramifications will be felt in the ED for some time.' For a second series running, the revamped theme tune introduced back in January 2014 during Series 28 remained the same with the exception of episode two that saw the use of the first ever theme tune and title card, with the original 1986 theme tune playing over a montage of Series 1 and Series thirty characters. Albeit with the closing credits remaining the same. The titles are modified as characters arrive or depart throughout the course of the series. Reception It was announced on 5 October 2015, that Casualty won the award for Best Drama at the Inside Soap Awards, beating off competitors Waterloo Road and sister show Holby City. Upon winning the award, Kent commented: \\"Team Casualty was utterly delighted to win the Inside Soap Award last night. Massive thanks to everyone who voted us!\\".

Casualty received 33% of votes, while Pobol y Cwm received the remaining 67% of votes. After Casualty aired their annual Christmas special episode on 19 December 2015, journalist Matt Baylis wrote an article on The Sunday Express explaining that he thought the episode was \\"a fine seasonal appointment with the Casualty team, let down slightly by the fine detail.\\" Baylis claimed that \\"Tiny things such as the time of day and the pointlessness of the question matter more than getting all the jargon right.\\" He did praise the show as well, however, saying that despite \\"going longer than the Nativity\\" the show \\"still finds ways to reinvent itself.\\" On 5 January 2016, it was revealed that Casualty had been shortlisted for the NTA Best Drama Award. However the show lost to rival Downton Abbey. It faced competition from Broadchurch, Doctor Who and Downton Abbey.

The novel was written (in Serbian) in 1960 and published in 1962, along with his novel The Attic, and tells the story of the last few hours of a woman and her child in a Nazi concentration camp, before they escape. In a narrative full of flashbacks and stream-of-consciousness passages, with elements derived from his own life, Ki≈° sketches the life of a Jewish woman who witnesses the Novi Sad raid, is deported to a Nazi camp where she gives birth to a boy, and escapes with the help of another woman. Months after the war's end she is reunited with her lover, a Jewish doctor who had assisted the Nazis in Joseph Mengele-style experiments. Plot Marija is the young mother of two-month-old Jan, and has been planning to escape from Auschwitz. Her friend ≈Ωana and the mysterious Maks have laid the groundwork for the escape, which is to take place as Allied troops are approaching, the sound of their distant artillery forming a constant background to the activities in the camp. Next to Marija in her bunk bed is Polja, who is succumbing to disease and will not survive the night. Marija dries her son's diapers, made from cotton rags, on her own legs, and ponders at which point Polja is far enough gone for her to start tearing up Polja's sheet to make diapers and sanitary napkins. The escape is to take place at 2:30 AM, and while they wait and try to sleep, Marija thinks back on her early and immediate past. Early in the book those are recollections of her immediate past in the camp. She had managed to tell Jakob, her lover, that she was pregnant, and later that she delivered a boy. In another recollection she thinks back on the evening spent in a closet hiding from Dr. Nietzsche: Jakob is a Jewish doctor who is surviving in the camp because he assists Nietzsche in his medical experiments on Jews, experiments involving sterilization, infection, and amputation. One evening, during a clandestine visit to Jakob, Nietzsche comes by and Marija is pushed into a closet, where she nearly passes out, but manages to hear Nietzsche explain to Jakob that the latter is to save the results of Nietzsche's experiments, especially his collection of Jewish skulls. As Marija listens, Jakob navigates between his disgust for Nietzsche and his need to collaborate in order to survive. After Nietzsche leaves, Marija leaves too but too noisily; as the guards run down the corridor she is pulled into a room and saved by Maks, whom she never sees but who has acquired mythical proportions. Later recollections occur as Polja is practically dead and ≈Ωana is urging Marija to rest as much as possible. These involve an early run-in with antisemitism: fourteen-year-old Marija, who grew up in the Vojvodina, was sent to the country to escape the persecution of Jews only to hear from a girl her age that she and her ancestors are guilty of killing Christ. She hastens home to her parents; her drunk father explains to her what is happening to the area's Jewish population, a truth she is not prepared to hear but then accepts. Soon her parents are deported, and Marija witnesses the atrocity of the Novi Sad raid, in which Hungarian troops killed between 3,000 and 4,000 civilians, in January 1942. She herself is hauled off to a camp soon afterward, where she meets Jakob. ≈Ωana, Marija, and Jan escape when the electricity to the barracks is cut off by Maks. They make their way through a hole in the floor to the fence, and crawl underneath. As they do so, Jan starts crying and German guards catch on, but thinking that they are women from the area looking to steal the camp's supplies they do not pursue them. Marija had agreed with Jakob to escape to Poland, while ≈Ωana wants to go to Strasbourg; when they go their separate ways it is clear that ≈Ωana is in poor condition, near death. That evening Marija knocks on the door of a German woman, some five hundred kilometers from Berlin, and is taken in by Mrs. Schmidt, the wife of a German officer who has been missing for four years. Schmidt blames the Jews for everything, and Marija is forced to pretend to be a Christian woman whose officer husband is on the Eastern Front. She lives with Schmidt for months, writing letters to find Jakob. Jakob has been convalescing in a hospital, but has lost all desire to live. A Dr. Leo procures a passport for him, and Jakob plans to travel to Canada, to leave Europe as far behind as possible. He makes one friend, a young boy named Danijel whose leg has been amputated in the very experiments Jakob participated in. On the day his passport arrives, he finally receives one of Marija's letters. In the epilogue, six years later, Marija, Jakob, and Jan travel back to the camp to show Jan where he was born. They visit when groups of tourists from Germany and the US are touring the camp, each group desecrating the memory of the dead and the survivors in their own ways. Background Ki≈° wrote the story as an entry in a competition organized by a Jewish cultural organization in Belgrade. He based it on a newspaper report he had read, about a couple who survived the war and went back to visit the camp where they had been held. The book was not published until two years later, by Globus in Zagreb. Ki≈°, who was born in 1935, was only 25 when he wrote Psalm 44, but his background prepared him well for such a work. His father, a Hungarian Jew from the Vojvodina, disappeared in Auschwitz; he and his mother survived the war in Hungary: these are also the subject matter of his 1972 novel Hourglass. In later interviews he distanced himself somewhat from the novel, saying it was too direct; the book's English translator John K. Cox suggests this may be in reference to his very prominent deus ex machina (the Maks character) or the \\"heavy-handed recasting of Mengele as 'Dr. Nietzsche'\\".Cox 142-43. The \\"heavy-handedness\\" of the Mengele character and other aspects of the book, including \\"purple outpourings of emotion\\", is noted also by Sam Sacks of the Wall Street Journal. Sacks compliments the translation by Cox, and praises the book as a whole: \\"the material in \\"Psalm 44\\" is inherently powerful, and some of Ki≈°'s writing, especially that describing the knife-edge escape, is quite fine\\".

Design and development The Kora was a two-seat side by side motorglider, intended as a trainer. Its long span, high aspect ratio wing gave it a respectable gliding performance. The overall layout was unusual, with a central pod fuselage in front of a pusher configuration engine and with its empennage on twin tail booms. It had a powered aircraft style tricycle undercarriage. The Kora was an all-wood aircraft and its constructors, Kortenbach & Rauh, were best known as furniture makers. It had a cantilever high wing with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes opened over the upper, inner wing surfaces from mid-chord. The central pod was broad, housing a cockpit wide under a starboard-side opening, two piece canopy which reached from the wing leading edge almost to the nose. Instructor and pupil sat side-by-side, with the Limbach SL 1700EC1 air cooled flat four piston engine behind them, where the wing became broader to allow propeller clearance. Two slender, tapering booms ran rearwards from the wing, each ending at a straight edged fin which tapered both above and below it. A tapered, straight edged tailplane was carried on top of the fins, projecting outwards. The rudders and one piece elevator were rectangular. Two prototypes were built, the first flying ion 13 September 1973. This had a fully retracting tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels retracting rearwards into the tail booms and the nosewheel rearwards into the fuselage pod. The second prototype, which flew in 1976, retained the retractable nosewheel but had fixed, spatted mainwheels on thin, cantilever, spring steel legs mounted on the lower fuselage to save weight and reduce complexity. The extra drag reduced the glide angle from 31.4 to 30 and increased the minimum sink rate from to . The second prototype was still undergoing flight tests early in 1978, when no decision on production had been reached despite orders for some twelve aircraft. It remained on the German civil aircraft register in 2010.

The family's later \\"modern\\" arms were: Barry wavy of six or and gules, as visible in Heanton Punchardon Church and at Watermouth Castle, Devon John Basset (1518‚Äì1541) was a young English gentleman from Devon, a member of the old Basset family, and heir to a substantial inheritance. His short life is well documented in the Lisle Papers. He studied law at Lincolns Inn and at the age of 20, at the start of a promising career, entered the household of Thomas Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal, but died suddenly aged only 23, albeit having married and produced a son and heir, born posthumously. His stepfather and father-in-law was Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (d.1542), Lord Deputy of Calais 1533‚Äì1540, a bastard son of King Edward IV and thus uncle of King Henry VIII, whose arrest with that of his mother in 1540 at Calais for heresy and treason, was a major, potentially catastrophic, event in his life. He died a year after the arrests, from an unknown illness, but his siblings all went on to have successful careers, especially his younger brother James, mostly as royal courtiers, apparently unaffected by the crisis.

Youth John's first ten years of childhood were probably spent at his father's principal seats of Umberleigh in Devon and Tehidy in Cornwall. After his father's death in 1528 John was brought up by his mother Honor Grenville and stepfather, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (d.1542), Lord Deputy of Calais, uncle of King Henry VIII. His mother's second marriage elevated the family from prominent West Country gentry into the highest circle of Tudor society, and also (by John's marriage to his step- sister) infused into them the royal blood of the last of the House of Plantagenet.Lord Lisle was the last, albeit illegitimate, in the direct male line of the Plantagenets, descendants of King Edward III =Wardship=To John Worth and his mother His father died in 1528 when John was still a minor aged 10 and on 29 May 1528 his wardship and marriage was purchased for 200 marks by John Worth of Compton Pole, Devon, Sewer to the Chamber of King Henry VIII, in partnership with his mother, still then Lady Basset.Byrne, vol.1, p. 315 John Worth was a distant cousin of his ward, being 8th in descent from John Worth (alias Wrothe) of Worth in the parish of Washfield near Tiverton in Devon, who married Margaret Willington, the second daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Willington of Umberleigh.Vivian, pp. 805‚Äì8, pedigree of Worth of Worth Yet Umberleigh did not descend in the male line of the Worth family as Margaret Willington bequeathed Umberleigh to her daughter Elizabeth Worth who married Sir William Palton, thus Umberleigh stayed in the Palton family for three generations until the family died out in the male line and Umberleigh reverted to the Beaumonts of Shirwell, surviving heirs of the Willingtons.Pole, pp .422‚Äì3, descent of manor of Atherington Isabel Willington, the eldest sister of Margaret Willington and her co-heiress, had married William Beaumont (1376‚Äì1408) of Shirwell, whose eventual heir to Shirwell and to Umberleigh was the Basset family.Vivian, p. 46, pedigree of Basset To Lord Lisle Before 1532 however John Basset's wardship and marriage had been purchased by his step-father Lord LisleByrne, vol.1, p. 316 who wishing to provide her a wealthy husband, married him off to his daughter, thus Basset's step-sister, Frances Plantagenet. In 1533 Lord Lisle was appointed Lord Deputy of Calais and moved there with Lady Lisle, John's mother, leaving John at Lord Lisle's manor of Soberton in Hampshire from 1533 to 1535.Byrne, vol.6, index, p. 321 Education John's education is well recorded in the Lisle Papers, covering the period 1533 to 1540, held at the UK National Archives. Three of his letters to his mother survive in this collection,Byrne, vol.1, p. 87 but most of the references to him are contained in letters written to his mother and step-father in Calais by their London business agent John Husee, who advised them and made practical arrangements and who knew his way amongst court and legal circles. He studied Latin for 14 months under the parson of Colmer.Byrne, vol.4, p. 1 In 1534 aged 16 he entered Lincolns Inn to train in the law, where he remained until 1536. Much detail of his life as a trainee lawyer are preserved in the Lisle Papers, mainly in the letters from John Husee to Lord and Lady Lisle, concerning domestic matters such as the clothing he required, rent of his chambers, financial allowance, his recreations, etc. It was Husee who arranged for John's admittance to Lincolns Inn and who found him a law tutor and chambers, and who advised John on his clothing requirements and how to decorate his chambers.Byrne, vol.4, p. 13 John had his own servant who lived with him named \\"Bremelcum\\". Husee wrote the following letter to Lady Lisle on 27 January 1535:Byrne, vol.4, letter 826, pp. 17‚Äì18 > \\"My humble duty premised unto your good ladyship...Mr Basset is all out of > apparel.

Lady Lisle was at this time petitioning Cromwell over the complex legal issues which were separating her son John from his Beaumont inheritance. At first John served as a waiter, which involved him being admitted every day to Cromwell's audience chamber when suitors presented their suits to the Lord Privy Seal.Byrne, vol.4, p. 88 Such a career move had earlier been suggested by George Rolle, who believed that from serving Cromwell, John Basset might more easily progress to serving the king himself.Byrne, vol.4, p. 87 His career was cut short by his early death in 1541 at the age of 23. Beaumont inheritance John Basset as well as being heir to his extensive paternal lands was also heir to his maternal great-grandmother Joan (or Johanna) BeaumontByrne, vol.1, p. 312 (wife of John Basset (1374‚Äì1463)), the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401‚Äì1450) of Shirwell by his wife Philippa Dinham, daughter of Sir John Dinham (1406‚Äì1458)Vivian, p. 46 of Nutwell, Kingskerswell and Hartland. Joan Beaumont was heiress to her brother Sir Philip Beaumont (1432‚Äì1473), MP in 1467 and Sheriff of Devon in 1469, and also to her mother Phillipa Dinham. These former Beaumont lands included the manors of Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon in North Devon. However, as deduced by Byrne (1981), Basset's father (Sir John Basset (1462‚Äì1528)) lacked the financial resources to recover his inheritance,Byrne, p. 313 which involved paying fines and recoveries to the King. At the time he had been married for 30 years to his first wife Elizabeth Denys and had given up any hope of producing a surviving son and heir. To make the best of his situation, he obtained financing for the recoveries from Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney (1451‚Äì1508), KG, under a special agreement entered into in 1504, referred to by the family as the \\"Great Indenture\\".Transcribed in Byrne, vol.4, chapter 7, appendix 2 This specified that Daubeney would pay about ¬£2,000 for the recoveries on condition that one of the Basset daughters and co-heiresses would marry Daubeney's son Henry Daubeney (1493‚Äì1548) (later created Earl of Bridgewater), then aged 10, before his 16th birthday. The purpose was to entail the Beaumont lands upon the male issue of a Daubeney-Basset marriage, thus increasing the future wealth of the Daubeney family. However the indenture allowed for Sir John Basset and any future wives of his to retain possession of Umberleigh and lands in Bickington during their lives. If the scheme should fail due to the marriage not taking place and in default of other provisions, the lands would revert to the right heirs of Basset. To this effect Basset sent two of his four daughters by his first wife Elizabeth Denys, namely Anne and Thomasine, to live in the Daubeney household. The marriage never did take place and Lord Daubeny died four years later in 1508. Whether for those reasons or another the gamble paid off for John Basset (1462‚Äì1528) as his second wife Honor Grenville produced for him a son and heir in 1518 and the Beaumont lands eventually came back to the Basset family, not without great struggles. During the time when the agreement was operative the deeds to the properties concerned were kept in safe custody by Richard Coffin (1456‚Äì1523)Byrne, vol.1, p. 605; Vivian, p. 208, pedigree of Coffin; Byrne, vol.1, p. 606: \\"died in Dec 1523 at age of 77\\" of Portledge, Sheriff of Devon in 1510,Risdon, Tristram (d. 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions; Pevsner, p. 477 the Beaumont's tenant at Heanton Punchardon and at East HaggintonByrne, vol.1, p. 605; East Hagginton had descended to the Beaumonts from the Punchardon (\\"Pont de Chardin\\") family of Heanton and in Risdon's time (d.1640) was still held by the Coffin family. In 1810 it had reverted to the Bassets (Risdon, pp.347,431) (in the parish of Berrynarbor), who was clearly trusted by both parties,Byrne, vol.1, pp. 605‚Äì6 and whose Easter Sepulchre tomb survives in the chancel of Heanton Punchardon church.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p. 477 Basset's son George later married Richard Coffin's great- granddaughter Jacquet Coffin.Byrne, vol.1, p. 605; Vivian, pp. 47, 209 The custody of these deeds forms an important topic in the Lisle Letters.Byrne, vol.1, p. 605 The matter of John Basset's inheritance had not been resolved at the time of his death in 1541, despite intervention at the highest level from his master Thomas Cromwell. Marriage and children In 1538Byrne, vol.6, index, p. 322 he married Frances Plantagenet, the daughter and co-heiress of his warder and step-father Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, bastard son of King Edward IV . She survived him and married secondly Thomas Monke (died 1583), of Potheridge in Merton, Devon (as his first wife), with whom she had three sons and three daughters. By her eldest son from this second marriage she was great-grandmother of George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608‚Äì1670), KG.Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, Proceedings, Volume 44, p. 12 By Frances Plantagenet John Basset had the following children: *Honor Basset, born at Calais in May 1539.Byrne, vol.4, p. 89 Shortly after her birth in 1540 disaster fell on the family with the arrest of Lord and Lady Lisle on suspicion of heresy and treason. Lord Lisle was sent to the Tower of London where he died in 1542, while Lady Lisle was kept under house arrest in Calais until after her husband's death. It appears that before June 1540 John went swiftly to Calais after hearing the news and brought back his wife and daughter to England. *Sir Arthur Basset (1541‚Äì1586), born posthumously on 4 October 1541, eldest son and heir, MP, of Umberleigh.Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, Proceedings, Volume 44, p. 12 Due to his Plantagenet ancestry, Arthur's son Sir Robert Basset (1573‚Äì1641) made what turned out to be a foolish and costly decision to offer himself as one of the many claimants to the throne of England after the death of Queen Elizabeth, perhaps encouraged by his father- in-law Sir William Peryam, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.Biography of Sir Robert Basset in History of Parliament He suffered a heavy fine for his action which according to the biographer John Prince (died 1723), involved the sale of thirty of the family's manors.Prince's \\"Worthies of Devon\\", biography of Col.

It was formerly one of the three terminus railway stations in Belfast. The others were , and . History=Belfast and County Down Railway= Queen's Quay station was opened in 1848 as Belfast and was the terminus of the Belfast, Hollywood & Bangor Railway. The Belfast and County Down Railway opened an adjacent station two years later, both stations merging after a further two years. At its height, it contained five platforms and operated services to , , , , and Newcastle. =Ulster Transport Authority / Northern Ireland Railways= The station and its lines were taken over by the Ulster Transport Authority in 1948, who then set about closing large portions of the County Down network. The lines from Queen's Quay to Ardglass, Comber and Newcastle were withdrawn in January 1950. The line to Donaghadee was then removed in April 1950. This left Queen's Quay for the remainder of its years as a fairly quiet terminus for the suburban services to and from Bangor. The interior of the station suffered extensive damage from bomb attacks as The Troubles took hold in Northern Ireland, leaving it a mostly-empty shell by the 1970s, when Northern Ireland Railways took over the country's rail network. A connection was provided at Ballymacarrett Junction to the Belfast Central Railway, which linked to the Great Northern Railway of Ireland at along a track through the site where station now stands. This was primarily used only for rolling stock transfers and freight workings, and closed in 1965. The connection and railway line was subsequently rebuilt in 1976 to allow Bangor line services to transfer to Belfast Central and run directly through to the rest of the Northern Ireland railway network. =Following closure= Queen's Quay station was closed on 10 April 1976. The rebuilt chord to Belfast Central was brought into operation the next day, and Bangor Line services began to operate into the city centre and through to the Newry Line. The station's train servicing facilities were then converted for use as Northern Ireland Railways' Central Services Depot, primarily for stock stabling and maintenance. This depot closed in 1994 to make way for the Cross-Harbour Rail Link including the Dargan Bridge, linking the Larne Line to Belfast Central, and the M3 flyover. Today, nothing of the station or the service depot remains. The site itself is mostly buried under the embankment for the M3 flyover, with only a small section of ground used as a tram stop for the station remaining open, now in use as a car park beside the motorway. However, the station clock which can be seen in the photograph below titled \\"Station interior in 1974\\" was salvaged when the station closed in 1976, and it still exists today. Service At its peak, services ran to Comber (where passengers would change for trains to Ardglass, Downpatrick and Newcastle), Donaghadee, and Bangor. Following takeover and subsequent rationalisation by the UTA, this left only the services to Bangor operating into the NIR era, until the station was closed in 1976.

At the assumed time of composition, this type of depiction was already well-established. On the left wing of the altar, Jesus is crowned with the Crown of thorns and confronts Pontius Pilate. The central panel depicts the Stations of the Cross, with the Crucifixion of Jesus as the central scene. This panel also shows the Harrowing of Hell and the suicide of Judas. On the right wing is the Lamentation of Christ, his burial, the meeting with Mary Magdalen, and the Ascension. The painter stresses the passion scenes as a bloody ordeal through the use of red paint throughout the whole image. With the exception of Jesus, Mary and John, everyone is depicted in contemporary clothing in a local landscape. The biblical scenes are presented to the viewer, providing the opportunity for introspection. Furthermore, in the division of the centrepiece into a \\"good side\\" on the left of the crucifixion and a \\"bad side\\" on the right and in the direction of glances and gestures towards the viewer, the panel demands that the viewer make a personal choice between salvation and damnation. On the left wing, the soldier bringing Jesus to Pilate has a scimitar and suit of armour of Turkish style, reflecting the great fear of a Turkish attack on Christian Europe at the time of the work's composition. In addition, a child with signs of down syndrome being deloused by a monkey in the possession of Satan, alludes to the role of Satan (who appears in person on the upper right of the central panel) in Christ's death. The thin youth with a dark beret is often considered a self-portrait of the painter. In the background of the left panel a church with unfinished towers is visible, which was long thought to be Cologne Cathedral (probably incorrectly). The Schildergasse and the Dreik√∂nigenpf√∂rtchen have been similarly identified in the alley in front of the cathedral, while the church facade poking out from behind a column has been identified as the Carmelite cloister of Cologne. On the outsides of the wings there are six saints under an arcade in front of a brocade pattern, who are face the viewer when the triptych is closed. The outer two saints are Carmelites and are especially emphasised by church steeples. The saints on the left wing are the Carmelite Saint Anthony of Hungary, Saint Barbara, Saint Sebastian; the saints on the left wing are Saint Lawrence, Saint Catherine and the Carmelite Saint Angel.  History  The exact date of the triptych's donation is not known. The supposed donor, Theodericus de Gouda was the Provincial superior of the Carmelite Cloister of Cologne and died in 1539.The theory that Theodericus de Gouda was the donor is generally followed in the scholarship, but there is actually no evidence. On this issue, see Marita to Berens-Jurk: Der Meister des Aachener Altars. Mainz 2002, Cat. A 1, n. 3‚Äì5. The triptych was on the Volksaltar of the Cologne Carmelite Church until 1642. It came into the Cologne collection of the Jacob Lyversberg before 1834 after which it went to the Cologne collection of Haan, from whom Aachen Cathedral acquired it in 1872. At that point it was installed in the Choir.  Painter  The unknown master responsible for the work, tentatively identified with the engraver P.W., seems to have been active in Cologne between 1480 and 1580. This explains the close relationship of his work to the works of his contemporaries in Cologne, the Master of St Severin and the earlier Master of the legend of St. Ursula, as a demonstration of the popularity of altar images in Cologne around 1495/1500.

A newly built ship is seen behind the ship under construction. Sonargaon, Narayanganj. Shipbuilding is a growing industry in Bangladesh with great potentials. Bangladesh has a long history of shipbuilding dating back to the early modern era. However, shipbuilding has become a major promising industry in recent years when the locally made ships began to be exported. Bangladesh has now over 200 shipbuilding companies, mostly concentrated in Dhaka, Chittagong, Narayanganj, Barisal and Khulna.  History  Due to the riverine geography of Bangladesh, ships have been playing a major role in the trade affairs of the people of this country since the ancient times. According to the accounts of the 14th century Moroccan traveler Ibn Batuta, there used to be large fleets of warships docked in various ports of the country. A medieval European traveler Caesar Frederick documented that the port city of Chittagong and Sandwip were manufacturing hubs of large ships during the mid 15th century. The volume of shipbuilding swelled extensively during the Mughal period. During the 17th century, the shipyards of Chittagong and Sandwip used to build warships for the Sultan of Turkey.Shipbuilding Industry in Banglapedia = Mughal era = During the Mughal Empire, the province of Bengal Subah had a large shipbuilding industry. Economic historian Indrajit Ray estimates shipbuilding output of Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at 223,250 tons annually, compared with 23,061 tons produced in nineteen colonies in North America from 1769 to 1771. He also assesses ship repairing as very advanced in Bengal. Bengali shipbuilding was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the time. An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a flushed deck design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The British East India Company later duplicated the flushed deck and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution. = Modern era = The Royal Navy had many warships built in Chittagong, some of which were also used in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited, the first modern shipyard of Bangladesh, was established in 1922, constructed during the British era in the subcontinent. After the liberation war in 1971, the dockyard was nationalized under the ministry of industries. Later it came under the control of Bangladesh Navy in 2006. In 1979, the sector received its first foreign investment after the independence of Bangladesh when Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Industry, a Japanese enterprise, formed a joint venture with High Speed Shipyard of Bangladesh to establish a shipyard at Fatullah, Narayanganj. By the 2000s, several more private shipyards were established and in 2008, Bangladesh became a ship exporting country.  Industry  Ships in shipyard at Buriganga River Ananda Shipyard and Shipways Limited (ASSL), founded in 1983 on the bank of Meghna river, became the first Bangladeshi shipbuilding company to export an ocean-going ship when it transferred the locally built \\"Stella Maris\\" to a Danish firm. ASSL has since then secured several more contracts, mostly from the European countries. Western Marine Shipyard is another company, based in Chittagong, which has secured many export contracts. There is also another shipbuilding company and they have the third largest shipyard in Bangladesh and it is situated in Meghna.The company's name is Khan Brothers Shipbuilding Limited. FMC Dockyard Limited is one of the renowned name in Bangladeshi shipbuilding industry. This is the only Dockyard of Bangladesh, which has its own forward and backward linkage facilities. The potentials of shipbuilding in Bangladesh has made the country to be compared with countries like China, Japan and South Korea. Referring to the growing amount of export deals secured by the shipbuilding companies as well as the low cost labor available in the country, experts suggest that Bangladesh could emerge as a major competitor in the global market of small to medium ocean-going vessels.

De Stichting van Zuid-Afrika door de V.O.C, p. 76 and he is recognized as contributing to the development of Botany and Ethnobiology. He declared two wars with the Khoikhoi. He died in Cape Town. Biography Johan Bax was the grandson of Joan Bax, governor of Heusden and Muiden. His father Willem Maurits, a captain in the Dutch States Army under Willem Ripperda, married Jeanette Hoefijser in 1630 in Deventer. In 1631 Willem moved to Amsterdam, and according to Fran√ßois Valentijn, Johan Bax was born in 1637 in 's-Hertogenbosch. He started his service with the Dutch East India Company around 1656. The following year he arrived in Batavia with Hendrik van Rheede and Isaac de l'Ostal de Saint- Martin. In 1663 he was involved in the attack on the Malabar coast under Rijckloff of Goens, in 1667 he stayed in Cochin. In 1669 at the age of 32, Johan Bax married Aletta Hinloopen (1649‚Äì1680), the daughter of Jacob Fransz Hinlopen in Batavia. This made Joan Huydecoper II his uncle. Bax served as the successor to Van Rheede in Colombo and Galle. There he and Aletta had a daughter who died within a year. He sent his uncle a mango, an acacia, a coconut, a civet and a Negombo devil.Heniger, J. (1986) Hendrik Adriaan van Reede tot Drakenstein (1636--1691) and Hortus Malabaricus -- A contribution to the history of Dutch colonial botany, p. 82. Bax was governor of the Dutch Cape Colony for two years, during which the status of the Cape Colony was reduced by the Dutch East India Company. Bax sent many specimens in to his uncle Huydecoper such as a herbarium, bulbs and seeds, as well as canaries, parakeets, a monkey and a young rhinoceros.Heniger, J. (1986) Hendrik Adriaan van Reede tot Drakenstein (1636--1691) and Hortus Malabaricus -- A contribution to the history of Dutch colonial botany, p. 71. Huydecoper sent Bax a gardener from Maarssen. He was named governor of Dutch Ceylon on 25 October 1678, but he died after a chest infection before he could take that position. He was buried on 4 July 1679 in Cape Town. Due to a shortage of slaves in the Dutch Cape Colony, his widow Aletta sold some of her slaves from Malabar before departing for Batavia. References * BACKX. Boeree,Th.A.

The Resettlement Department () was a department of the Government of Hong Kong, which was responsible for constructing resettlement estates for the homeless refugees. It was established in 1954. In 1973, the Resettlement Department and the Building Section of the Urban Services Department were merged to form the Housing Department, which acts as the Housing Authority's executive body.\\"Memories of Home ‚Äì 50 Years of Public Housing in Hong Kong\\" History In December 1953, a major fire destroyed the slum area in Shek Kip Mei and more than 50,000 refugees from Mainland China were made homeless. After the disaster, then Governor Sir Alexander Grantham ordered Ronald Holmes to establish the Resettlement Department and appointed him as the Deputy Colonial Secretary and the first Commissioner of Resettlement. The Resettlement Department was formed from sections of the Public Works Department, the Social Welfare Department, and the Urban Services Department. The development of public housing marked a radical shift from the laissez- faire philosophy of the Government. In order to resettle the homeless refugees in a short period of time, Holmes took the lead to construct a number of resettlement estates on the burnt ground in Shek Kip Mei and in its neighboring area. Some of the notable examples included Shek Kip Mei Estate and Tai Hang Tung Estate.„Äà‰ΩïÁ¶ÆÊñáÁàµÂ£´Âú®Â∏åÁóÖ‰∏ñ„ÄâÔºå„ÄäÂ∑•ÂïÜÊó•Â†±„ÄãÁ¨¨ÂÖ´È†ÅÔºå1981Âπ¥6Êúà16Êó•„ÄÇ After the creation of the Resettlement Department, constructing public housing estate for resettling the poor people became one of the primary policy goals set by the government in postwar Hong Kong.

Despite public support of the railway proposal, sufficient funding was never obtained and the proposals were abandoned.  History  The passing of the Light Railways Act in 1896 led to the proposal of two light railways in Hampshire‚Äîthe Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway and the Highclere, Kingsclere and Basingstoke Light Railway. The former was begun in 1898, and in 1900 a proposal for the Highclere‚ÄîBasingstoke line was issued. The proposal called for public subscription, and sufficient interest was gathered to allow an amount of land in Kingsclere (at the present-day Wellmans Meadow, ) to be purchased for Kingsclere Station. Other methods of acquiring land included offering landowners shares in the railway in return for access to their land. There was much public interest in Kingsclere about the railway, though sufficient funds‚Äîin either cash or shares‚Äîwere never raised and the proposal was dropped in the early 20th century.  Route  The proposed railway would have diverted from the DNSR south of near the village of Burghclere. From there it would have headed south-east through the villages of Ecchinswell, Kingsclere, Wolverton, Ramsdell, Monk Sherborne and Sherborne St John.

The name used in western European languages originates as a Normannic name recorded since the High Middle Ages, and the French name Yves is a variant of it. The unrelated South Slavic name is a variant of the name Ivan (John). Origins The name is recorded from the High Middle Ages among the Normans of France and England (Yvo of Chartres, born c. 1040). The name's etymology may be either Germanic or Celtic, in either case deriving from a given name with a first element meaning \\"yew\\" (Gaulish Ivo-, Germanic Iwa-).Campbell, Mike Ivo (Behind the Name: The Etymology and History of First Names) The name may have been spread by the cult of Saint Ivo (d. 1303), patron saint of Brittany. The Slavic name is a hypocorism, like its variant Ivica. Variations Ivo has the genitive form of \\"Ives\\" in the place name St Ives. In France, the usual variation of the name is Yves.

Along with Lew Hayman and L√©o Dandurand, Cradock co-founded the original Montreal Alouettes in 1946. The team quickly gained respectability, winning the Grey Cup in 1949. Cradock had a flair for showmanship and was successful in attracting paying customers. Cradock sold his shares in the Alouettes for profit in 1952 and returned to Toronto. In the mid-1950s he angled to take control of Toronto Argonauts from the Argonaut Rowing Club. In 1956 he joined another ownership trio, this time with John Bassett and Charlie Burns, and became co-owner of the club. Cradock brought back old friend Hayman to run the club. He had sold out by 1960, apparently over differences with Bassett. Football was not his only avenue of sports entrepreneurship.

It forms a pendant with the Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse. Though it is no longer known which name belongs with which face, the regents portrayed were Jonas de Jong, Mattheus Everzwijn, Dr. Cornelis Westerloo, Daniel Deinoot and Johannes Walles.Catalog number 86, Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive (editor), with contributions by Pieter Biesboer, Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S. Jowell, Koos Levy-van Halm and Liesbeth Abraham, Bianca M. Du Mortier, Irene van Thiel-Stroman, Prestel-Verlag, Munich & Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, 1989, Frans Hals painted them in his \\"loose style\\", with rough brush strokes. The painting is traditionally dated 1664, though no archival evidence has yet been found to confirm this. The date is chosen as the middle of the term that the sitters served as regents. Though the paintings as pendants seem to belong together, they did not hang together, and as was the case in the St. Elisabeth hospital across the street, they probably each hung in a separate regents' meeting room; the one for the ladies in the ladies' meeting room and the one for the men in the men's meeting room. The standing figure second from the right is holding out a piece of paper. He is older and wearing a collar that was long out of fashion by the 1660s. He is probably a valued servant or concierge, but his name has been lost. Seated next to him is a man wearing a floppy hat perched at an angle. His face appears distorted and some critics felt that Hals had lost his touch, while others believed the man had been drunk or suffered from nerve damage in the right half of his face, perhaps from a stroke. Whatever the case, the regents never complained about the painting and it is likely that they were satisfied with the commission they gave to the elderly Hals. In the 19th century when Hals' loose brushwork became popular with impressionists, several copies were made of this painting.100 Jaar Frans Hals Museum, Antoon Erftemeijer, Frans Hals Museum, 2013 A much earlier copy that was made in the 18th century shows how layers of varnish almost made the table disappear altogether over time. Today the painting is considered one of the highlights of the Frans Hals Museum, which is housed in the same building for which it was originally commissioned. The complex has been unrecognizably rebuilt, however, and the painting no longer hangs in a specific place, but moves around according to various exhibition needs.

His elder brothers who survived childhood were Francis Hamilton Wedgwood, Josiah C. Wedgwood and Ralph Wedgwood. Wedgwood was educated at Newcastle High School, Clifton College, and Trinity College, Cambridge. Felix and Ralph Wedgwood (who also attended Trinity from 1895) are mentioned in Period Piece, the childhood memoir by their second cousin Gwen Raverat (1885-1957). After university, he worked as a civil engineer specialising in the purchase and recovery of shipwrecks.Hugh Cobbe, Letters of Ralph Vaughan Williams 1895-1958.  Mountaineering travels  Wedgwood was an amateur mountaineer, and travelled to South America and to Canada. In 1905 he sailed from Southampton to Buenos Aires.Britain: outbound passenger lists 1890-1960. NB: mistranscribed as \\"A.T. Wedgwood\\" While in Argentina, he suffered frostbite on Aconcagua. In 1908, having travelled onto Canada, he, Joseph William Andrew Hickson, Edward Feuz, Jr and Gottfried Feuz climbed Mount Assiniboine.William Lowell Putnam and Andrew J. Kauffman, The Guiding Spirit, 1986. Although they summitted, they were assailed by a storm on the descent. In Canada, he met his future wife, Katharine Longstaff; she was the daughter of Llewellyn W. Longstaff, and sister of a fellow climber Tom Longstaff. She named Wedgwood Peak for him, having been the first to summit it.Wedgwood Peak.

The species is native to southeastern Europe and the Middle East. It is named in honour of the Austrian botanist and explorer Karl Georg Theodor Kotschy.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cyrtopodion kotschyi, p. 145). Description Kotschy's gecko is a slender lizard growing to a length of about including its tail. Females grow slightly larger than males. The limbs and tail are slim and there are small tubercles on the back and tail. The digits do not have adhesive pads but the toes are relatively long with a kink in the middle. The colour is rather variable and may have a background of yellowish-grey, greyish-brown, dark brown or reddish-black. The dorsal surface is marked with \\"W\\"-shaped transverse bands of darker colour. Like other geckos, the markings remain the same but the overall shade can be darker in cool conditions and paler in the heat of the day. The underparts may be yellowish or orange. Distribution and habitat Kotschy's gecko is native to Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. Its typical habitat is cliffs, dry stony areas, scrub, tree trunks, stone walls, and the external and internal walls of buildings. It is found at elevations of up to but is mostly a lowland species. Behaviour Kotschy's gecko is mainly nocturnal but at cooler times of year it is often active in the day as well, especially early and late. It climbs very well despite having no adhesive pads, but spends less time on cliffs and climbs less high than the wall lizards (Podarcis) spp., with which it is often found. When disturbed, it retreats into dense undergrowth, hides in crevices among rocks, or clings onto the underside of overhangs. It is infrequently found in buildings. The voice is a repeated high-pitched \\"chick\\", and males and females may call to each other during courtship. Reproduction The female Kotschky's gecko lays two eggs (occasionally one) under stones or in a crevice and these take eleven to eighteen weeks to hatch into juveniles about long. These offspring become mature in about two years, and Kotschy's gecko has been known to live for nine years in captivity. Status Kotschy's gecko is listed by the IUCN as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it has a very wide range and is common over much of this range. The population trend is unknown, but it faces no particular threats, although deforestation might be a threat in Israel and Jordan where it is mostly found on tree trunks. It is possible that this might be a species complex, and if so, individual populations might need to be placed in a more threatened category. ReferencesFurther reading *Boulenger GA (1885).

Along with Qui-Lim Choo, George Kuo and Daniel W. Bradley, he co-discovered Hepatitis C in 1989. He also co-discovered the Hepatitis D genome in 1986. The discovery of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) led to the rapid development of diagnostic reagents to detect HCV in blood supplies, which has reduced the risk of acquiring HCV through blood transfusion from one in three to about one in two million. It is estimated that antibody testing has prevented at least 40,000 new infections per year in the US alone and many more worldwide. Houghton is currently Canada Excellence Research Chair in Virology and Li Ka Shing Professor of Virology at the University of Alberta, where he is also Director of the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. He is the co-recipient of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Harvey J. Alter and Charles M. Rice.  Early life and education  Born in the United Kingdom in 1949, his father was a truck driver and union official. At the age of 17 Houghton was inspired to become a microbiologist after reading about Louis Pasteur. Houghton won a scholarship to study at the University of East Anglia from where he graduated with a degree in biological sciences in 1972, and subsequently completed his PhD in biochemistry at King's College London in 1977.  Career  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2020: Seminal experiments by HJ Alter, M Houghton and CM Rice leading to the discovery of HCV as the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Houghton joined G. D. Searle & Company before moving to Chiron Corporation in 1982. It was at Chiron that Houghton together with colleagues Qui-Lim Choo and George Kuo, and Daniel W. Bradley from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, first discovered evidence for HCV. This research, however, has been challenged on the basis of failure to demonstrate pathogenicity ‚Äì in other words, that the virus identified by Houghton actually causes hepatitis. Houghton's research depended on the work of his later Nobel co-recipient Harvey Alter dating from 1978. Alter's NIH team had drawn blood from what was known as \\"Non-A Non-B Hepatitis\\" and injected it in five Chimpanzees. After 14 weeks, the chimpanzees showed elevated liver values on standard tests - possible evidence for a virus (notably Alter's experiment lacked a control group, meaning a liver reaction to foreign blood serum could not be ruled out) After a well- funded publicity campaign by Chiron to gain support from the NIH's establishment, an FDA 1992 Blood Supply order reaped millions for the corporation. Chiron's CEO boasted, \\"We have a blockbuster product.\\" The evidence for HCV alleged by Chiron and Houghton at the time of the many blood screening orders for this blockbuster product was circumstantial, as the virus had not been isolated by traditional means and would remain an enigma for many years. By the 8th International HCV Congress in Paris in 2001, Houghton exclaimed in exasperation, \\"Where is the Hepatitis C Virus? Has anybody seen it?\\" Nobel co-recipient Charles Rice published papers claiming an answer to this question. Houghton was co-author of a series of seminal studies published in 1989 and 1990 that identified hepatitis C antibodies in blood, particularly among patients at higher risk of contracting the disease, including those who had received blood transfusions. This work led to the development of a blood screening test in 1990; widespread blood screening that began in 1992 with the development of a more sensitive test has since virtually eliminated hepatitis C contamination of donated blood supplies in Canada. In other studies published during the same period, Houghton and collaborators linked hepatitis C with liver cancer. In 2013, Houghton's team at the University of Alberta showed that a vaccine derived from a single strain of Hepatitis C was effective against all strains of the virus. the vaccine is in pre-clinical trials.

Located in Studiestr√¶de, between Axeltorv and H. C. Andersens Boulevard, it was Denmark's first waterworks and continued operations until 1951. The complex was designated an Industrial Heritage Site in 2007 and listed in 2010. The former engine house is now home to concert venue Pumpehuset. The other buildings house a daycare. History The waterworks as seen from the West Rampart shortly after its completion in 1859 Copenhagen's water supply was until the second half of the 19th century based on surface water from Damhus Lake. A dam on Harrestrup √Ö at Roskilde Road made it possible to lead water through Gr√∏ndals√•en and Ladeg√•rds√•en to Sortedam and Peblinge Lakes. Copenhagen Waterworks was one of the first buildings to be built outside Copenhagen's old city walls. The arrangement of the individual buildings, which appears random today, resulted from construction on a former ravelin. A commission was set up in 1847 to investigate possible improvements of Copenhagen's water supply but it took the 1853 Copenhagen cholera outbreak to make the politicians take action. The British company Cochrane & Co was charged with the design and construction and overall design of the system while the architect Niels Sigfred Nebelong designed the individual buildings. Cochrane & Co. had previously also constructed of the city's first gasworks. Carlsberg-founder J. C. Jacobsen set the foundation stone on 16 May 1857 and waterworks was inaugurated on 9 August 1859. The new pumping station contained three large steam engines drove the pumps. They produced a combined capacity of 300 hp. It extracted water from the lakes around Copenhagen as well as ground water and used an elevation reservoir in S√∏ndermarken The capacity was increased in 1875 and 1889. The waterworks ceased operations in 1951. Architecture The original buildings are all built in yellow brick with arched windows and have slate roofs. The pumping station is located in the centre of the site and consists of a two-storey machine house and a one-storey boiler house that are attached to each other as well as a small coal house on the south side of the boiler house. The chimney is from 1929. It was originally 43 m high but it was shortened by 10 m for security reasons. The other buildings are residences for the inspector and technical employees, a half-timbered gatehouse (1887, Ludvig Fenger) and three administration buildings the youngest of which is from 1951. Today The music venue has used the central pumping station since 1987. The other buildings are under transformation into a kindergarten.

Lee Monument in Richmond, Virginia, was the first installation on Monument Avenue in 1890, where it remained the largest statue on the site. Since early July 2020, it is the last Confederate monument on the Avenue. Removal of the statue is currently blocked, pending an October 19 trial. History The monument in Richmond in 2013 In 1876, the Lee Monument Association commissioned a lithograph of a painting by Adalbert Volck. The lithograph, depicting Robert E. Lee on his horse, was the basis for the bronze statue created by French sculptor Antonin Merci√©. It was noted in the National Register of Historic Places that \\"the horse is not a representation of Lee‚Äôs famous mount Traveller. The sculptor did not find the size of the actual horse to be in keeping with the overall composition and therefore created an ideal mount with the necessary requirements.\\" The cornerstone was placed on October 27, 1887. The statue was cast in several pieces separately and then the assembled statue was displayed in Paris before it was shipped to Richmond, where it arrived by rail on May 4. DuPriest, James E., Jr. and Douglas O. Tice, Jr., Monument & Boulevard: Richmond;s Grand Avenues, A Richmond Discoveries Publication, Richmond, VA 1996 p, 6 Newspaper accounts indicate that 10,000 people helped pull four wagons with the pieces of the monument. The completed statue was unveiled on May 29, 1890. The state-controlled land around the statue serves as a traffic circle at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Allen Avenue (named after Otway Allen, the developer who donated the land to the association). Lee stands high atop his horse and the entire statue is tall standing on a stone base. and Accompanying four photos The site for the statue originally was offered in 1886. Over some opposition, the offer was accepted and later withdrawn when opponents complained that the $20,000 for the Lee Monument was inappropriate because the site was outside the city limit. Richmond City annexed the land in 1892, but bad times economically caused the Lee Monument to stand alone for several years in the middle of a tobacco field before development resumed in the early 1900s. The Lee Monument is a focal point for Richmond. (Most popular online maps depict the \\"Lee Circle\\" as the center of Richmond, although the United States Post Office uses the intersection of North and South Foushee Street where it intersects with East and West Main St as 0 axis Point of all address in the Richmond region, hence the true address center of Richmond. The Virginia Department of Transportation and the Virginia State Police use the state Capitol building as its center.) In 1992, the iron fence around the monument was removed, in part because drivers unfamiliar with traffic circles would run into the fence from time to time and force costly repairs. After the fences came down, the stone base became a popular sunbathing spot. DuPriest, James E., Jr. and Douglas O. Tice, Jr., Monument & Boulevard: Richmond;s Grand Avenues, A Richmond Discoveries Publication, Richmond, VA 1996 p. 8 In December 2006, the state completed an extensive cleaning and repair of the monument. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2007, the Virginia Landmarks Register since 2006, and is located in the Monument Avenue Historic District. Controversy and removal The monument defaced as part of the George Floyd protests. In 2017, after the violence that occurred at the Unite the Right rally, significant outrage and debate occurred relating to the monuments including the Lee statue in both Charlottesville and Richmond, Virginia. On June 4, 2020, Virginia governor Ralph Northam announced the statue would be removed in response to the protests that followed the May 2020 killing of George Floyd. On June 8, a judge in Richmond Circuit Court issued a temporary injunction against the monument's removal, citing a lawsuit filed by William C. Gregory, who claims the Commonwealth promised to \\"faithfully guard\\" and \\"affectionately protect\\" the statue in the deed that originally annexed the property to the state. Subsequent legal proceedingsAmended lawsuit seeking to halt Robert E. Lee statue‚Äôs removal challenges Northam‚Äôs authority (July 9, 2020) lead to a hearing on July 23, which concluded without a ruling on the monument's future. A new 90-day injunction against the monument's removal began August 3. After nearby residents filed a lawsuit to keep the statue in its place, Virginia's Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the suit; circuit court Judge W. Reilly Marchant ruled August 25, 2020 that the matter would proceed to trial on October 19, 2020. Following Black Lives Matter protests in June, the traffic circle where the statue stands was updated with a sign that reads \\"Welcome to Beautiful Marcus-David Peters Circle, Liberated by the People MMXX\\" (after Marcus-David Peters, a Black man from Richmond who was shot and killed by the police in 2018). In 2020, The New York Times described the defaced statue as among the most influential American protest artworks since World War II.

It was first referred to in the 1981 book by Ollie Johnson and Frank Thomas The Illusion of Life, and is a part of the 12 Basic Principles of Animation. It contrasts with its converse, pose to pose animation, in that it does not use inbetweening. Straight ahead action is so named because the animator literally works straight ahead from the first drawing of the scene. Disney director-animator Woolie Reitherman said, \\"When i didn't know what I was doing in an action, I always went straight-ahead. I'd just start on ones. Half the time I didn't know what I was doing. To me, it's fun. You find out something you wouldn't have found out otherwise.\\"  Advantages and risks  Straight ahead animation is mostly used for wild, scrambling actions where spontaneity is important. Because the animator has no real guide to the target destination in the action, a character's form may start to shrink or grow, and the animator will have no idea it happened until after he is done. Although this technique is a lot more spontaneous and creative, it can create inaccurate results. = Advantages = * The animator gets a natural flow of fluid, spontaneous action. * It has the vitality of improvisation * It's very 'creative', the animator goes with the flow, creating all of the action as it comes along * Often the unconscious mind starts to kick in: like when authors say that their character speaks to them and tells them where it's going. * It can produce surprises; what animators call \\"Magic\\". = Risks = * Things start to wander. * Time stretches and the shot gets longer and longer. * Characters grow and shrink. * The animator can miss the point of a shot and not arrive at the right place at the right time. * The director can't see what's happening in the shot, and it's very difficult for more than one animator to work on the scene. The best way for an animator to make use of the Straight ahead action, is to use it to animate things that have very erratic and unpredictable movement patterns. Fire, water, and fog are some examples of movement that are better animated with the use of the Straight ahead animation technique.

Taking place in an alternate history, the story presents the further adventures of Dido Twite, a teenage Victorian tomboy, in southern England. The novel is chronologically the fifth of the Wolves Chronicles, a series of books set in a fictional 19th century in which the Stuart kings had not been ousted by William of Orange; a key plot driver (from Black Hearts in Battersea) is the efforts of \\"Hanoverians\\" to overthrow \\"King James III\\" and his heirs. The Cuckoo Tree was published before its prequel, The Stolen Lake.  Plot  Captain Hughes and Dido Twite are travelling by stagecoach from the port of Chichester with important dispatches for the Admiralty in London when the carriage is upset and Captain Hughes is injured. While looking for help, Dido encounters a group of men who direct her to Teaglaze Manor; the men turn out to be smugglers who use the local canal system to transport their wares to London. At Teagleaze Manor, Dido encounters several characters including Lady Tegleaze, who sends her servants and personal physician to the aid of Captain Hughes. Hughes is settled in an abandoned tenant cottage to recover, under the care of a local nurse, the unpleasant Mrs. Lubbage. Unwilling to trust the local postman and needing to get the dispatches to London, Dido goes to \\"the Cuckoo Tree,\\" a local landmark used as a rendezvous by the smugglers. There she encounters Cris, a mysterious child who proves to be a key element in a plot to swindle Lady Tegleaze out of her property. However there is another plot afoot; Lady Tegleaze's lawyer, Mr. Fitzpickwick, is in league with a Hanoverian agent planning to kill the young king at his coronation. With the aid of Cris and the Wineberry smugglers, Dido must rescue Lady Tegleaze' grandson Sir Tobit and race the Hanoverian plotters to St. Pauls Cathedral, where her old friend Simon is now Master of the King's Garlandries.

The GI Jive entry in The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series noted, \\"She attempted to answer each letter sent in and included a picture of herself.\\" In 1945, it was reported that Martha Wilkerson could boast of receiving one-fourth of all the fan mail inspired by the Armed Forces Radio Service's 122 air shows.

The laws mandate that religious liberty of individuals can only be limited by the \\"least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest\\". Originally, the federal law was intended to apply to federal, state, and local governments. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court in City of Boerne v. Flores held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act only applies to the federal government but not states and other local municipalities within them. As a result, 21 states have passed their own RFRAs that apply to their individual state and local governments. Pre Hobby Lobby The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at through (also known as RFRA), is a 1993 United States federal law that \\"ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected.\\" The bill was introduced by Congressman Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on March 11, 1993. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-MA) the same day. A unanimous U.S. House and a nearly unanimous U.S. Senate‚Äîthree senators voted against passage‚Äîpassed the bill, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law. The federal RFRA was held unconstitutional as applied to the states in the City of Boerne v. Flores decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress's enforcement power. However, it continues to be applied to the federal government‚Äîfor instance, in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal‚Äîbecause Congress has broad authority to carve out exemptions from federal laws and regulations that it itself has authorized. In response to City of Boerne v. Flores and other related RFRA issues, twenty-one individual states have passed State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that apply to state governments and local municipalities. State RFRA laws require the Sherbert Test, which was set forth by Sherbert v. Verner, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, mandating that strict scrutiny be used when determining whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing religious freedom, has been violated. In the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which usually serves as a model for state RFRAs, Congress states in its findings that a religiously neutral law can burden a religion just as much as one that was intended to interfere with religion;Religious Freedom Restoration Act full text at http://www.prop1.org/rainbow/rfra.htm therefore the Act states that the \\"Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\\" The federal RFRA provided an exception if two conditions are both met. First, the burden must be necessary for the \\"furtherance of a compelling government interest\\". Under strict scrutiny, a government interest is compelling when it is more than routine and does more than simply improve government efficiency. A compelling interest relates directly with core constitutional issues. The second condition is that the rule must be the least restrictive way in which to further the government interest. Post Hobby Lobby In 2014, the United States Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. recognizing a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief. Nineteen members of Congress who signed the original RFRA stated in a submission to the Supreme Court that they \\"could not have anticipated, and did not intend, such a broad and unprecedented expansion of RFRA\\". The United States Government stated a similar position in a brief for the case submitted before the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, writing that \\"Congress could not have anticipated, and did not intend, such a broad and unprecedented expansion of RFRA. ... The test Congress reinstated through RFRA ... extended free-exercise rights only to individuals and to religious, non-profit organizations. No Supreme Court precedent had extended free-exercise rights to secular, for-profit corporations.\\" Following the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision, many states have proposed expanding state RFRA laws to include for-profit corporations, including in Arizona where SB 1062 passed by in Arizona but vetoed by Jan Brewer in 2014. Indiana SB 101 defines a \\"person\\" as \\"a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association\\" or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued, \\"regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes\\". Indiana Democrats proposed an amendment that would not permit businesses to discriminate and the amendment was voted down. An RFRA bill in Georgia has stalled, with constituents expressing concern to Georgia lawmakers about the financial impacts of such a bill. Stacey Evans proposed an amendment to change references of \\"persons\\" to \\"individuals\\", which would have eliminated closely held for-profit corporations from the proposed law, but the amendment was rejected because it would not give protections to closely held corporations to practice religious freedoms granted by the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby case. Some commentators believe that the existence of a state-level RFRA bill in Washington could have affected the outcome of the Arlene's Flowers lawsuit. Politifact reports that \\"Conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage.\\" Despite being of intense interest to religious groups, state RFRAs have never been successfully used to defend discrimination against gays‚Äîand have rarely been used at all. The New York Times noted in March 2015 that state RFRAs became so controversial is due to their timing, context and substance following the Hobby Lobby decision. Several law professors from Indiana stated that State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts like \\"Indiana SB 101\\" are in conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's Free Exercise Clause jurisprudence under that \\"neither the government nor the law may accommodate religious belief by lifting burdens on religious actors if doing so shifts those burdens to third parties. [...] The Supreme Court has consistently held that the government may not accommodate religious belief by lifting burdens on religious actors if that means shifting meaningful burdens to third parties. This principle protects against the possibility that the government could impose the beliefs of some citizens on other citizens, thereby taking sides in religious disputes among private parties. Avoiding that kind of official bias on questions as charged as religious ones is a core norm of the First Amendment.\\" The Supreme Court for example stated in Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc. (1985): \\"The First Amendment ... gives no one the right to insist that, in pursuit of their own interests others must conform their conduct to his own religious necessities.'\\" Relying on that statement they point that the U.S. Constitution allows special exemptions for religious actors, but only when they don't work to impose costs on others. Insisting on \\"the constitutional importance of avoiding burdenshifting to third parties when considering accommodations for religion\\" they point out the case of United States v. Lee (1982). Here the court stated: Effects of RFRAs on state court cases Mandates courts use the following when considering religious liberty cases: #Strict scrutiny #Religious liberty can only be limited for a compelling government interest #If religious liberty is to be limited, it must be done in the least restrictive manner possible States with RFRAs=By legislature= Legislatures of 21 states have enacted versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act: * Alabama (state constitution amendment) * Arizona * Arkansas * Connecticut * Florida * Idaho * Illinois * Indiana * Kansas * Kentucky * Louisiana * Mississippi * Missouri * New Mexico * Oklahoma * Pennsylvania * Rhode Island * South Carolina * Tennessee * Texas * Virginia =By state court decision= An additional 10 states have RFRA-like provisions that were provided by state court decisions rather than via legislation: * Alaska * Hawaii * Ohio * Maine * Massachusetts * Michigan * Minnesota * Montana * Washington * Wisconsin =Reversals= Some states have had legislation withdrawn or vetoed.

Additional details on specific state laws=Arkansas= In April 2015, the governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, signed a religious freedom bill into law. The version of the bill he signed was more narrow in scope than the original version, which would have required state and local governments to demonstrate a compelling governmental interest to be able to infringe on someone's religious beliefs. =Georgia= In March 2016, the Georgia State Senate and the Georgia House of Representatives passed a religious freedom bill. On March 28, Georgia's governor, Nathan Deal, vetoed the bill after multiple Hollywood figures, as well as the Walt Disney Company threatened to pull future productions from the state if the bill became law. Many other companies had also been opposed to the bill, including the National Football League, Salesforce, the Coca-Cola Company, and Unilever. =Indiana= In March 2015, Gov. Mike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, allowing business owners who object to same-sex couples on religious grounds to opt out of providing them services. =Mississippi= In April 2016, Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, signed into law a bill that protects people from government punishment if they refuse to serve others on the basis of their own religious objection to same-sex marriage, transgender people, or extramarital sex. The sponsors of \\"Project Blitz,\\" a coalition of conservative Christian organizations supporting dozens of \\"religious liberty\\" bills at the state level across the United States, see Mississippi's law as model legislation. =Missouri= On March 9, 2016, the Missouri State Senate passed a religious freedom bill. Senate Democrats tried to stop the bill with a 39-hour filibuster, but Republicans responded by forcing a vote using a rarely used procedural maneuver, which resulted in the bill passing. In April, it was defeated 6-6 in a Missouri House of Representatives committee vote, with three Republicans joining three Democrats in voting against the bill. =South Dakota= On March 10, 2017, Dennis Daugaard, the governor of South Dakota, signed into law SB 149, which allows taxpayer-funded adoption agencies to deny services under circumstances that conflict with religious beliefs. = Texas = On May 20, 2019, the Texas House passed a version of Senate Bill 1978 which prohibits the government from penalizing anyone for ‚Äúmembership in, affiliation with, or contribution...to a religious organization.‚Äù The bill was expected to pass the Senate again rapidly and to be signed by the governor. On June 10th, 2019 the governor signed the bill officially into law and it took effect immediately.https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB1978/2019 Some have called it the \\"Save Chick-fil-A\\" law, given that the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A has been criticized for its donations to anti-LGBT causes.

The Balfour Note of 1 August 1922, signed by Britain's acting Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, was sent to Britain's debtors France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Portugal and Greece. Balfour claimed that the British government had reluctantly decided that the loans that those countries had received from HM Treasury should be paid back and that reparations from Germany should be collected due to the need for Britain to pay its creditor, the United States.Rhodes, p. 50. Background Due to the inadequacy of British industry to produce munitions during the Great War, the British government had required munitions from America, and a large proportion of these munitions had been used by France, Italy and other European Allies. Britain owed America nearly ¬£900 million and the total debt owed to Britain from its Allies was nearly four times that figure.Blake, p. 490. Contents Balfour pointed out that so far the British had not asked the Allies for either the payment of interest or the repayment of capital on the debts owed by them to Britain. In the meantime Britain had been required to meet her obligations to America. Balfour announced that the British government was prepared, through an international settlement, to remit all debts due to Britain by the Allies and also the reparations owed by Germany. Balfour also said: > In no circumstances do we propose to ask more from our debtors than is > necessary to pay to our creditors. And, while we do not ask for more, all > will admit that we can hardly be content with less. For it should not be > forgotten, though it sometimes is, that our liabilities were incurred for > others, not for ourselves. The food, the raw materials, the munitions > required for the immense naval and military efforts of Great Britain, and > half the ¬£2,000,000,000 advanced to allies, were provided, not by means of > foreign loans, but by internal borrowing and war taxation. Unfortunately a > similar policy was beyond the power of other European nations. Appeal was > therefore made to the Government of the United States; and under the > arrangement then arrived at the United States insisted, in substance if not > in form, that, though our allies were to spend the money, it was only on our > security that they were prepared to lend it. This co-operative effort was of > infinite value to the common cause, but it cannot be said that the role > assigned in it to this country was one of special privilege or > advantage.Dugdale, p. 258. He then warned of the consequences of international indebtedness: > To generous minds it can never be agreeable, although, for reasons of State, > it may perhaps be necessary, to regard the monetary aspect of this great > event as a thing apart, to be torn from its historical setting and treated > as no more than an ordinary commercial dealing between traders who borrow > and capitalists who lend. There are, moreover, reasons of a different order, > to which I have already referred, which increase the distaste with which His > Majesty's Government adopt so fundamental an alteration in method of dealing > with loans to allies. The economic ills from which the world is suffering > are due to many causes, moral and material, which are quite outside the > scope of this despatch. But among them must certainly be reckoned the weight > of international indebtedness, with all its unhappy effects upon credit and > exchange, upon national production and international trade.

In the 1960s a women's association held negotiations and meetings with Japanese people on where to conduct classes. Some of the Japanese individuals they negotiated with were lecturers at Monash University. On 25 July 1968 the Department of Education of the State of Victoria permitted the society to use the premises of the Malvern Central State School for a supplementary Japanese lessons. It opened in September of that year. While many Japanese wanted a full-time Japanese school, the government of Victoria had not yet granted permission to establish it. In September 1972 a full Saturday only Japanese program opened.\\"Annual Reports 2012.\\" (Archive) The Japanese School of Melbourne. p. 2/16. Retrieved 4 January 2014. At one time Japanese officials asked for permission for the establishment of a Japanese school when the Premier of Victoria had approached them to discuss the possibility of further Japanese investment in Victoria. The property of the Holy Cross Primary School went up for sale in 1981, and the supplementary school asked Japanese people to join a subscription effort. The supplementary school purchased the property in May 1982. On 21 June 1984 the school, prompted by the chamber of commerce, appointed a committee for establishing a full time Japanese school. The school board asked for funds to buy four prefabricated classrooms in February 1985. These classrooms were completed in December 1985. The Victorian state government stated its willingness to allow a full time Japanese school to be operated in April 1986. In May 1986 an invitation for subscriptions circulated among the Japanese. On 13 May 1986, the full time school opened at its current location with 96 students. A new Japanese supplementary school in Melbourne opened because the previous supplementary school had converted into a full time school; therefore most of the initial students of the JSM were previously students of the predecessor supplementary school. The peak enrolment of the JSM was over 150 students. The 1990s recession in Japan forced many families of employees of Japanese companies to return to Japan, so the student body declined. As of 2012 the school had 53 students, including 3 preparatory students, 33 students in primary school, and 17 students in secondary school. Operations the school received subsidies from the Australian and Japanese governments, and a head official of the school stated that therefore the JSM had tuition that is about 33% of those of area private schools. Curriculum Over 90% of the school's coursework is in the Japanese language.Mizukami, p. 153. The curriculum and selection of the teaching staff is oriented towards Japanese people temporarily living in Australia, and the school management also is oriented towards that clientele. In 1987 the JSM established interchange classes with area Australian schools at the junior high school level. The school created a civics textbook on Australian society in February 1992.Mizukami, p. 152. Student body Most students are temporary residents of Australia, though some are from Japanese families who permanently moved to Australia. In 1996 400 children of ages 6‚Äì15, the ages for elementary and junior high school, lived in Melbourne, and of those 25% went to the JSM, with the remainder going to Australian schools. At the time some Japan-born children attended Australian schools and were moved to a nihonjin gakk≈ç for their final year in Australia, since they were due to return to Japan.Mizukami, The Sojourner Community, p. 148.

The transform can be applied to analog temporal signals such as communication signals, or to digital spatial data such as images. The transform reshapes the data in such a way that its output has properties conducive for data compression and analytics. The reshaping consists of warped stretching in the Fourier domain.

Jalali, \\"Demonstration of analog time-bandwidth compression using anamorphic stretch transform\\", Frontiers in Optics (FIO 2013), Paper: FW6A.2, Orlando, USA. is a mathematical transformation in which analog or digital data is stretched and warped in a context-aware manner, such that it results in nonuniform Fourier domain sampling. The transformation is defined as: AST \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde{E}_{in}(\\\\omega) \\\\right \\\\\\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\tilde{E}_{in}^*(\\\\omega)\\\\tilde{E}_{in}(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_m) e^{j\\\\omega_m\\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\phi(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_m)-\\\\phi(\\\\omega)}{\\\\omega_m} \\\\right ]} d\\\\omega} where \\\\tilde{E}_{in}(\\\\omega) is the input optical spectrum, \\\\phi(\\\\omega) is the spectral phase added by AST (e^{j\\\\phi(\\\\omega)} being the AST warp kernel), and \\\\omega and \\\\omega_m denote the optical and envelope modulation frequencies, respectively. The detailed of the reshaping depends on the sparsity and redundancy of the input signal and can be obtained by a mathematical function, which is called \\"stretched modulation (S_M) distribution\\" or \\"modulation intensity distribution\\" (not to be confused with a different function of the same name used in mechanical diagnostics). S_M \\\\left (\\\\omega_m ,T\\\\right ) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\tilde{E}_{in}^*(\\\\omega)\\\\tilde{E}_{in}(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_m) e^{j\\\\omega_m\\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\phi(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_m)-\\\\phi(\\\\omega)}{\\\\omega_m} \\\\right ]}e^{j\\\\omega T} d\\\\omega} The stretched modulation distribution is a 3D representation of a type of bilinear time‚Äìfrequency distribution similar, but not the same, as other time-frequency distributions.L. Cohen, Time-Frequency Analysis, Prentice-Hall, New York, 1995. B. Boashash, ed., \\"Time-Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing ‚Äì A Comprehensive Reference\\", Elsevier Science, Oxford, 2003.S. Qian and D. Chen, Joint Time-Frequency Analysis: Methods and Applications, Chap. 5, Prentice Hall, N.J., 1996.J. W. Goodman, that describes the dependence of intensity or power on the frequency and time duration of the modulation. It provides insight on how information bandwidth and signal duration are modified upon nonlinear dispersion in the time domain, or upon nonlinear diffraction in the spatial domain. \\"Introduction to Fourier Optics\\", McGraw-Hill Book Co (1968). One can interpret the added phasor term e^{j\\\\omega T} to represent the effect of a time-shift on the spectral autocorrelation of the signal. As a result, the S_M distribution can be used to show the effects of the AST spectral phase \\\\phi(\\\\omega) on the temporal duration and intensity envelope bandwidth of the output signal, which is useful in visualizing the time-bandwidth product of the signal. Sparsity requirement AST applies a tailored group dispersion to different spectral features. By matching the group delay dispersion to the spectrum of the particular signal of interest, it performs frequency to time mapping in a tailored fashion. Information rich portions of the spectrum are stretched in time more than sparse regions of the spectrum making them easier to capture with a real-time analog-to-digital converter (ADC), similar to the methodology used in time-stretch ADC technology. This property has been called \\"self-adaptive stretching\\". Because the operation is specific to the spectrum of the signal, it does not require knowledge about the instantaneous time domain behavior of the signal. Hence no real-time adaptive control is needed. The parameters of AST are designed using the statistical spectral (not instantaneous) property of signal family of interest in the target application. Once the parameters are designed, they do not need to respond to the instantaneous value of the signal. The resulting non-uniform sampling, where information rich portions of the signal are sampled at a higher rate than the sparse regions, can be exploited for data compression. As any other data compression method, the maximum compression that can be achieved using AST is signal dependent. Limitations and challenges The reconstruction accuracy and lossy nature of this compression method have been analyzed previously. The system reshapes the spectro-temporal structure of the signal such that nearly all the signal energy is within the bandwidth of the real-time digitizer of the acquisition system. Because of the limited bandwidth and the limited resolution of the digitizer, as measured by its effective number of bits (ENOB), the reconstruction will never be ideal, and therefore, this is a lossy compression method. Because of this, only modest compression can be achieved in practice. Alternatively, the reconstruction process can be greatly simplified if the information desired is encoded in the spectral envelope of the input signal instead of the temporal envelope. In such a scenario, the true output can be reconstructed simply by directly de-warping the measured output given the designed warp kernel. This has been achieved experimentally for optical image compression. Digital implementation In the digital implementation of AST (DAST) that is performed in 2D and applied to digital images, an appropriately designed warp kernel stretches the input in a way that reduces the overall spatial bandwidth and hence the sampling requirement. The previous equation for AST can be rewritten in discrete form for DAST as: \\\\breve{B}[n,m] = \\\\left\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K\\\\left [n-k_1,m-k_2\\\\right ]\\\\cdot B\\\\left [k_1,k_2\\\\right ]\\\\right^N, where K[n,m]= e^{j\\\\phi[n,m]} is the digital version of the warp kernel. Similar to the case of 1-D temporal waveforms, the warped waveform can then be sampled at a lower rate than what was previously possible with na√Øve uniform downsampling. This property, known as \\"feature-selective stretching\\", can be used for digital image compression. There are two challenges in DAST, (1) image reconstruction, and (2) design the warping kernel. The warped mapping is typically performed in the frequency domain. Reconstruction (inverse mapping) of the spatial image via Fourier transform require knowledge of phase in addition to amplitude of the warped image. In the original AST and DAST papers, ideal phase recovery was assumed to show the useful impact of warp transformation. However, as mentioned above, it has also been shown that phase recovery and signal reconstruction depends on the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Finite SNR will compromise the quality of phase recovery and data compression. Because of this challenge, practical implementation of anamorphic data compression is not achieved yet. With respect to the challenge of finding the right kernel, an algorithm has recently been reported. Similar to the simplified reconstruction approach above mentioned above, a digital implementation for image compression which uses direct warping has also been recently reported. In this alternative data compression method, information- rich portions of the data are dilated in a process that emulates the effect of group velocity dispersion on temporal signals. With this coding operation, the data can be downsampled at a lower rate than without it, even when considering the overhead in transmitting the warping information. In contrast to previous implementation of the warped stretch compression, here the decoding can be performed without the need of phase recovery. Relation to phase stretch transform The phase stretch transform or PST is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification. Both phase stretch transform and AST transform the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index). The difference between the two mathematical operations is that AST uses the magnitude of the complex amplitude after transformation but phase stretch transform employs the phase of the complex amplitude after transformation. Also, the details of the filter kernel are different in the two cases. Applications=Image compression= Anamorphic (warped) stretch transform is a physics-based mathematical operation that reduces the signal bandwidth without proportionally increasing the size of the signal, thus providing space- bandwidth product compression. Its digital implementation emulates the physical effect by a non-uniform allocation of pixel density. This compression mechanism can be used as a pre-processing operation than may enhance conventional image compression techniques.M. H. Asghari and B. Jalali, \\"Image compression using the feature-selective stretch transform\\", 13th IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT 2013), Athens, Greece. =Time domain signals= The technology makes it possible to not only capture and digitize signals that are faster than the speed of the sensor and the digitizer, but also to minimize the volume of the data generated in the process. The transformation causes the signal to be reshaped is such a way that sharp features are stretched (in Fourier domain) more than coarse features. Upon subsequent uniform sampling this causes more digital samples to be allocated to sharp spectral features where they are needed the most, and fewer to sparse portions of the spectrum where they would be redundant.

It was constructed between 1914 and 1923. It is the fourth successive church of the same name to be constructed at the site. The church lost its visual dominance of the city after the construction of a mall in 1974. The mall has since been demolished and today the church is at the heart of the revitalisation of the neighbourhood. History of the parish An epidemic hit the colony as the Recollects were building a hermitage which was then dedicated to Saint Roch, a patron saint of ailments, illness and dangers. Saint Roch is also invoked against cholera, epidemics and plague, knee and skin problems, and is invoked to help bachelors, dogs, the falsely-accused, invalids, surgeons, and tile makers. As the neighbourhood increased in population and activity, a newer, bigger church was needed, one that suited the new centre of Quebec City. The first public worship was held in 1917. The current building The design, by the same architects as the Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√© Basilica, combines a Gothic Revival exterior with a Romanesque Revival interior. The style was inspired by the work of Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. The steel-framed building is clad in black granite from nearby Rivi√®re-√†-Pierre and has two 45 metre steeples. The interior is made of Saskatchewan marble that contains visible fossils. Inside is artisanal work, for example fine carpentry and sculpture in the oak furnishing, mosaic in the marble altar, and ironwork. The medieval-style windows show scenes of the New Testament, Old Testament, scenes from the religious history of Quebec, and scenes from the life of Saint Roch.

P. (ed.) (1985) Masterpieces From The National Museum Collection. National Museum, New Delhi. Ancient Indian temples house numerous kinds of wood carvings having religious context to be used for various temple activities. The majority of Vahanas are made of wood and decorated with designs made with varied techniques. Vahanas have been mentioned in temple inscriptions dating back to the 13th century.Sri Varadarajaswami temple, kanchi: A study of its History, Art and Architecture, K.V. Raman, Abhinav publication,2003  Use of vahanas  Vahanas are mythical carriages of the Hindu Gods and life-sized or large versions of vahanas are especially used to mount the movable images of deities. In southern India, especially Tamil Nadu, annual religious festivals that last from a week to ten days involve the parading of deities mounted on a vehicle around the temple.  Symbolism  The vahanas are both the symbol and the emblem of the deity that they carry. In Hindu iconography, positive aspects of the vehicle are often emblematic of the deity that it carries such as Nandi, the bull, vehicle of Shiva, represents strength and virility. Parvani the peacock, vehicle of Kartikeya, represents splendor and majesty. The Hamsa, vehicle of Saraswati, represents wisdom, grace and beauty. However, the vehicle animal can also symbolizes the evil forces over which the deity dominates. Mounted on Parvani, Kartikeya reins in the peacock's vanity. Seated on the \\"Mushika\\", Ganesh crushes useless thoughts, which multiply like rats in the dark. Shani, protector of property, has a vulture, raven or crow in which he represses thieving tendencies. Under Shani's influence, the vahana can make even malevolent events bring hope.

It is possible that a grammar of decorative art might be written from the study of wood carving alone and there is a circumstantial fact that the wood and the stone carvers belong to one and same caste. This may be accepted as an additional evidence in favour of gradual production of the one form the other and that at not very ancient date. There are various techniques by which the 'Wood' has been ornamented in several specific ways such as by carving, inlaying, veneering, lacquering, etc. The art of wood carving have been greatly influenced by the grain of the timber employed, that is possible with type of woods such as teak, red wood, walnut and low relief of Sheesham and Deodar the incised design of ebony. The intricate and the ornamental details of the Sandal and the barbaric boldness of Rohira, Sal and Babul and other coarse grained and hard woods.Art and Craft of India, A descriptive study, George Watt, Percy Brown, cosmo publication, New Delhi, 1979 India has a range of woods and every kind has its own particular properties of grain and strength. The skillful wood-workers has worked on it tirelessly and evolved styles and items depending on the quality of available wood and their own ingenuity to tackle it, thus creating an enormous range in wood products of all kinds. In Tamil Nadu, Virdunagar was once a traditional centre, Devakottai and Karaikudi are known to make traditional wooden panels in different sizes and Nagercoil and Suchindram have traditional carvers who make religion figures. Wood carvings are appreciated also for the special type of wood used in them, like rosewood for its faint perfume like rose water and lovely ebony- black colour. Madurai is famed for rose wood carving marked by its bold style and very detail works. Tirupati area of Andhara pradesh has red sandal wood known as 'Raktachandan' which is blood coloured Sandal wood. The coppery glow in this wood brings special charm. Sandal wood from karnataka is also known for its own intrinsic quality and superb carving possibility. This region is inhabited by many of the most talented wood carvers .Indian Art at Delhi 1903, official catalogue of the Delhi Exhibition 1902-1903, sir George Watt, Percy Brown, The Superintendent of Government printing, Calcutta, India. The technique type of carving are in the round, in relief, chip, incised and piercing. In the first the object is totally detached from main wood background such as 3D form of a human and animal figure. In relief the figure etched and raised on the background wood, which can be high or low relief. Chip consist of evolving designs by chipping the wood used mostly in ornamental and decorative work. Incised is done without ground work mostly put out flowers and creeper motifs. Pierced is for effective ornamentation in which the wood is completely cut away leaving just the design that calls for extra scale. Karnataka is also famous for Rosewood artefacts, some of the best specimen of wood work is provided by the mighty pyramidal gateway of temple. An extension of this covers Temple chariots or Rathas,Temple Chariots, Choodamani Nandgopal. as they are called. The one in which the deity is carried is called Agami and is the most heavily ornamented with numerous sculptures such as flying angels, horsemen, elephant, eagle, swan, tigers etc. Another style of ornamentation is painting and inlay, often with precious metals like silver and gold.The Glory of Indian Handicrafts, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay.

Its principal task is the continuing education of medical practitioners. The society's headquarter is the Billrothhaus in the 9th district of Vienna. The organization's main task is the education of medics and the presentation of new scientific findings in the field of medicine. For this purpose, the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte organizes scientific events, runs a library and publishes educational videos. The physician Helmut Sinzinger was the latest president of the organization. He died at the beginning of 2020.  History = Early stages= Franz Wirer 35 years prior to the foundation of the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte in Wien, young physicians met to discuss relevant scientific information. These meetings were the basis for the society's formation. The √Ñrztevereinigung (physician's club) was founded in 1802 by Johann Anton Heidmann (1775‚Äì1855). Its members subscribed to medical journals then passed them on to other members. The scientific results where discussed during weekly meetings in the apartment of Dr. Heidmann and, after 1804, that of Dr. Malfatti. Other famous members of the club were Ludwig Freiherr von T√ºrkheim, Franz Wirer and Johann Friedrich Osiander. This association published a yearly journal, the Gesundheitstaschenbuch (Health Manual). The √Ñrzteforum (physicians' forum) was founded in the early 1830s and had very renowned medics amongst its members, including Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff, university professor at the Josephinum in Vienna, Johann Hassinger, who later was deemed surgeon general, Heinrich Herzfelder, later the Chief Physician in the Israelite Hospital, Ludwig Wilhelm Mauthner von Mauthstein, founder of St. Anna children's hospital and the first professor of pediatrics, as well as the practicing physician Rudolph von Vivenot. = Beginnings of the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte in Wien = Assembly hall of the old University of Vienna: the first headquarter of the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte ‚Äì today it is the headquarter of the Academy of Sciences. Theodor Billroth Franz Wirer and Ludwig T√ºrkheim, who both were rectors at the University, are considered \\"the founding fathers\\" of the organization; however, this was not possible until the privy councilor Andreas Joseph von Stifft, who was against the creation of the society, died. Their main goal by creating the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte was to promote the health sciences as art and science, prior to the goals of the √Ñrztevereinigung. Additionally, they hoped to use it as a platform to formulate their response to the ongoing cholera epidemic. Over time, their objectives changed. In 1839, the society changed its focus to promoting drug sciences. The foundation of the Royal Academy of Sciences (\\"Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften\\") in 1847 also helped to promote the medical sciences. While the theoretical subjects such as physics, chemistry, anatomy and biology were discussed in the Academy and published in its journal \\"Denkschrift\\", the College of Physicians focused on pathology, experimental anatomy, medical chemistry and, in particular, clinical medicine. It is due to the influence of the academy and the college that the faculty of medicine broadened their limited scope beyond medical education and focused increasingly on science and research. In 1837, the foundation of the society was finally officially approved. The charter members were of course Franz Wirer and Ludwig Turkheim, as well as Johann Malfatti, the general practitioners Gerhard Brants and Joseph von Vering, the director of the general hospital Franz Xaver G√ºntner, the professor of pathology and pharmacy Leopold Franz Hermann, the climatologist Rudolph von Vivenot, the president of the faculty Johann Nepomuk von Raimann and the professors of the Josephinic Academy Friedrich J√§ger von Jaxtthal and Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff. The first president was Johann Malfatti, who was succeeded by Franz Wirer in 1841. The number of members was at first regulated to a maximum of 40 but raised over time (100 members in 1839, 200 members in 1859). One of the goals of the society was to establish and nurture a library. Today, it has one of the largest private medical-scientific book collections in the world. The first librarian of the yet-to-be-built library, circa 1840, was the district physician Hermann Hieronymus Beer. The first significant contribution was made by the second president of the society, Franz Wirer, who bequeathed his private book collection to the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte after his death. All the scientific meetings of the society where documented and published in \\"Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte\\" and later in \\"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\\". Under the presidency of Franz Wirer, the members were divided into four sections: pharmacology, pathology, hygiene and therapy. The members were free to choose their affiliation. This compartmentalization led to an increased number of meetings, as many as 45 per year. After the disbanding of the sections, the frequency decreased to 25 to 35 meetings per year. = Second medical school = Rokitansky Carl After Carl Rokitansky was elected president of the society, in 1850, the association focused increasingly on the natural sciences, leading to a new direction for medicine and to the dawning the new era of the Second Medical School (Zweite Wiener Medizinische Schule). The transition towards education is strictly linked to Carl Rokitansky, Joseph Skoda and Ferdindand Hebra. It marks the elevated status of medicine from the philosophic era to one in which scientific discoveries and clinical manifestations were correlated to pathological findings. During World War I, the frequency of scientific meetings decreased due to difficulties, and addressed mainly plagues, diseases and injuries caused by the war. Under the National Socialist Regime a law was pushed through in 1938 which stated that any organization had to be led by national socialists. This law marked the abolition of the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte. The commissarial conductor of this time was a member of the NSDAP, Adolf Irtl. A few weeks later, the \\"Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft\\" (Viennese Medical Society) was founded, and Otto Planner-Plan was appointed as chairman. It basically assumed all tasks from the College of Physicians, but, due to the war, meetings were rare. = After World War II = The end of World War II was equivalent to the abolition of the Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft. Leopold Arzt, the chairman of the university's dermatology clinic, began to rebuild the Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte. Some of the property of the organization was lost during the war. The library had been moved to a barn in the very north of Austria to protect it from air raids. However, it was under threat from humidity and theft. The Billrothhaus also suffered damage from the war. Thanks to the members funds for both the repairs and the library retrieval were amassed. The society was re-established and officially approved in April 1946. Wolfgang Denk was elected president.Amtsblatt der Stadt Wien. 27 February 1946 Springer publishing took over the publication of the \\"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\\", which had been discontinued in 1945. Karl Hermann Spitzy, who gained international renown for his work with penicillin, was president from 1982 to 1991. Franz Kainberger, who is leading the organization today, assumed the presidency after Karl Heinz Tragl, who served from 2007 to 2011. Radiologist Walter Hruby was president from 2015 to 2019. Since March 2019 Helmut Sinzinger (specialist in nuclear medicine) is the current president. Sinzinger died on February 21, 2020.  Science and community medicine = Scientific meetings = The most important function of the College of Physicians is the organization of lectures and discussion forums which showcase important health topics and new scientific findings. In the immediate post-war years, the College focused on infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, typhus, pest, pox, erysipelas, rabies but more than anything else, the cholera epidemic. Some of the members' important discoveries even made their way into hospital routine. Karl Eduard Hammerschmidt presented a sphygmometer in 1843, an innovative device to analyze the heartbeat and the arterial pulse. The section of pharmacology contributed to the creation of an Apothecaries Act for the Kaiserstaat Austria, to prevent materialists and spice merchants from selling drugs. Many lectures dealt with childbed fever which was dreaded due to its high mortality rate. Johann Klein played an important role in these discussions. The medical students under his supervision used to visit the obstetrics ward directly after leaving the autopsy site, without washing their hands. Klein had several arguments with Ignaz Semmelweis, who attributed childbed fever to this behavior. In 1845 and 1848 the society's journal \\"Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der √Ñrzte\\" published articles which encouraged all physicians to follow Semmelweis' recommendations. In 1850 Ignaz Semmelweis gave a lecture and reported his findings to the society's members. To handle increasing demand of water in Vienna, the College of Physicians initiated the \\"Drei- Quellen-Projekt\\" (Three Springs Project), which made it possible to access water from surrounding springs. The project was officially introduced by Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1873. As the percent of Vienna's population with clean water rose, there was a drastic decline in cholera cases. In addition to infectious diseases, the post-WW II society focused on the progress in antibiotics, radiotherapy, surgery and cortisone for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Since 2000, the lectures have also addressed the study of medicine in Austria because the educational system came under fire. = Therapy = Following a discussion about quackery, the medical profession was forced to become more rigorous in clinical practice. The College of Physicians is responsible for two prominent therapeutic progresses: one is the application of electric current in therapeutic measures, the other is the establishment of a laboratory for chemical analysis in the Vienna General Hospital. This laboratory opened the gate to a large number of scientific discoveries, such as the pathomechanism of diabetes. Florian Heller presented a reagent to measure the sugar level in urine, which was subsequently adopted into hospital routine. By 1874, the laboratory had become a state-of-the-art chemical analysis unit, and after 1889, through the influence of Ernst Freud, advanced further, becoming an innovative research institute which developed techniques pertaining to blood coagulation, cell membranes, gastric autodigestion, the effect of insulin and other biologic processes. During this time, significant progress was also made in the areas of microbiology and surgery. Carl Koller discovered the anesthetic effect of cocaine and Ludwig T√ºrck, who later became the first tenured professor of laryngology, invented a laryngoscope and marked the birth of endoscopy. This first endoscope was continuously refined, and in 1879, the Nietze-Leiter-cystoscope, which is used to examine the urinary bladder, was presented in a meeting of the College of Physicians. Further modifications made the first esophago- and gastroscopy, by Carl Stoerk and Joseph Leiter, possible. Subsequently, Johann von Mikulicz perfected the device. using it to make the first endoscopic diagnosis of gastric cancer. Another project initiated by the college was the foundation of a hospital in Mariahilf - Vienna's sixth district. Although the construction was approved and initiated, it was halted by World War I. Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis pathogen, which led to enormous progress in the battle against this disease. The College of Physicians established a committee for prevention and therapy of tuberculosis and finally published a report with four crucial points: informing the population, reducing exposure to pathogens by improving equipment hygiene, preventing infection, establishing diagnostic and treatment methods through bacteriological tests, by isolating people exposed to tuberculosis, and providing work. In 1896, Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen wrote a letter to Franz Exner and informed him of his finding - the X-ray. This led to intensive research in this field. A few days later (even before R√∂ntgen had a chance to present his findings in W√ºrzburg), the College of Physicians presented the first radiograph of a shotgun injury. The first radiologic atlas was published by Josef Maria Eder and Eduard Valenta in February 1896. Even the first angiogram was produced in Vienna by Eduard Haschek and the idea to use X-rays in radiotherapy came from Leopold Freund, who very successfully treated a naevus with it. = Research = In 1901, the journal ‚ÄúWiener klinische Wochenschrift‚Äù published an article by Karl Landsteiner entitled ‚Äú√úber Agglutinationserscheinungen normalen menschlichen Blutes‚Äù, which is seen as the foundation of grouping; this changed the picture in medicine completely. For the discovery of the AB0 blood group system, Landsteiner received the nobel prize in 1939.  Location  Billrothhaus from outside The meetings of the society initially took place in the consistory room at the old university. At this point it was not possible to establish a much needed library. Due to the growing audience, the society moved to the 4th floor of the Domkapitel at Stephansplatz in 1841, where a library and a reading room could be built. the group relocated many times again until 1855, when the government provided a gratis flat for them at Teinfaltstra√üe; this was the society's headquarter for the next forty years. The last relocation occurred on July 23, 1893, into a new building, Frankgasse 8, named after Theodor Billroth. Today, the Billrothhaus remains the headquarter of the College of Physicians, also housing the society's library. = Library = The library was one of the primary goals of the association. Since its foundation, the collection has grown, through donations and swaps, as well as contributions by members. Today, the Billrothhaus library is one of the most precious book collections worldwide.

It was named after Theodor Billroth, an Austrian physician and former president of the society, Theodor Billroth.  History  Theodor Billroth Due to the increasing size of the society's book collection and its membership, the society's operations relocated several times. Eventually in 1855, the former society president, Heinrich Bamberger, set up a committee to plan the construction of a building on a site to be purchased by the society. In 1888, Theodor Billroth, the then-president, called upon the members to buy shares of the yet-to-be-built society house. A 662m2 site in Vienna's 9th district was bought for 57,000 guilders. The committee established the following building requirements: * minimum 300 seat assembly hall * minimum 100 seat gallery * display room for the anatomic and histologic specimens * library and reading room * green room and archive * 80-100 seat general conference room and administrative board conference room * flat for the janitor * cloakrooms and toilets on every floor The architect Ludwig Richter was awarded the commission and two years later, on October 27, 1893, the building was officially opened by Theodor Billroth. The two story building, with basement, has undergone several alterations since 1906. The patio was deepened and the basement dried in order to create a book storage area. In 1909, the patio was extended to accommodate large and small archives and a cloakroom. The library and the large conference room remain on the wing facing the street. The small conference room, behind the stairway, has been converted into a reading room where members can browse journals. On 9 May 1919 the newly elected president, Anton Eiselsberg, proposed, and the society agreed, that the building be named \\"Billrothhaus\\". During World War II the College of Physicians was abolished and replaced by the \\"Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft\\" which was controlled by the Nazis. The library was removed to a barn to protect it from bomb attacks. The Billrothhaus which sustained damage during the war, was repaired after the war's end, when the College of Physicians was reinstituted. The library was retrieved and the basement was altered into book storage. The building has been under monumental protection since 2008.  Architecture  Archive seen from the stairs of the large library Votive tablet in a niche of the vestibule of the Billrothhaus with references to the creation of the building The Billrothhaus, erected 1892/93 has two floors and five axes. It is a palatial building in the Neo-Renaissance style. The front is rusticated and at the level of the upper floor, arched windows can be found between Corinthian pilasters. An attic style balustrade is arranged on the entire length of the building above the profiled ledge. The balustrade was originally decorated with statues of Apollo, Asklepios, Hygieia and Minerva, made of Loretto stone by the sculptor Anton Pavel Wagner. Beyond a curved entry hall a wooden door with original corroded discs grants access to the building. Another similar door straight ahead leads to the yard, and to the right a stair with handrails between two marble columns leads to a spacious foyer on the elevated ground floor. The foyer and the vestibule are equipped with terrazzo floors. The original porter's lodge is located to the left of the entry hall and behind it, in the backyard section of the building, is a meeting room with old wooden furniture. A richly ornamented niche in the vestibule shows a bust of Emperor Franz Joseph I and on its side walls, a votive table reveals some facts concerning the construction. The sides of the staircase are framed by adjusted pillars and the foyer is decorated with composite pilasters and a stucco ceiling. The reading room on the ground floor is equipped with partially original bookshelves and a gallery with lathed columns. The large, rectangular auditory is located on the upper floor and is circumferentially equipped with a matroneum. The wall is segmented with alternating arches and pilasters. Lunette caps with plaster busts of famous medics are located above them. The coffered ceiling is made of stucco. Two marble busts, Joseph Skoda and Theodor Billroth, are placed on the balustrade. The small conference room is located in the wing facing the backyard; it is richly ornamented with two busts and a painting.  Library  One of the society's ultimate objectives, from its start, was the establishment of a library. Most of the medical scientific journals were acquired by barter or endowment - either from members or outsiders. The library's inventory grew. through book donations from members, as well as from benefactors of institutions (such as the court library or Prince Klemens Metternich) so large that by 1840, the founding year of the library, a librarian had to be recruited. Since 1900, even clinics and institutes of the Vienna General Hospital have donated books and journals. After World War I, the members used their connections to enlist foreign literature, ultimately acquiring contributions from Uruguay, the London University and the Rockefeller Foundation. Today, the library at the Billrothhaus is one of the most precious book collections worldwide. Isidor Fischer, the librarian after 1923, was able to contract barter agreements with German institutions, which guaranteed a certain contingent of scientific journals. In exchange, the library offered the society's own journal, the \\"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\\". After the annexation of Austria to Germany, Isidor Fischer had to go into exile, but shortly before he was able to publish a book about the College of Physicians, of which he was not named as an author. During the society's abolition, i.e. World War II, Adolf Irtl assumed the business affairs by creating the \\"Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft\\". During the appraisal of the company's property, the library was deemed \\"priceless\\". In 1946, the society was reinitiated, and the library reactivated. As members rekindled their connections with foreign colleagues, the inventory of medical books and journals grew again. Large sections of the Billrothhaus library were relocated to the library of medical history, on permanent loan. In 1967 more than 30,000 books (10,000 of them doublets) were transferred. In 2006, approximately 26.000 history-of-medicine monographs and 300 journals documenting the medical developments during the former Habsburg monarchy, were added to the permanent loanstock. The volume of journals kept growing. However, the changing culture of the librarians, as well as scarce financial resources forced the library to develop a new concept. Since 1997, printed journals have been replaced by electronic journals. A document supply service was established, which granted access to scientific articles. The service continued to expand such that today it has a system for Medline- search, about 700 electronic journals and a catalogue of the historic collection. In collaboration with the Austrian Medical Association, the society offers E-learning courses for physicians since 2004, and since 1998, all scientific meetings are captured on video and uploaded onto their website.

El Desperado and Ibushi had faced off in an IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship match at February's The New Beginning in Osaka, where, following Ibushi's win, he was challenged by Nick Jackson. This led to a singles title match between the two for April 3, where Ibushi was victorious, and a tag team title match three days later, where The Young Bucks made their third successful title defense. In the second title match, Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) won the NWA World Tag Team Championship for the first time, defeating the returning National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) team The IronGodz (Jax Dane and Rob Conway). Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi at Invasion Attack 2014 in what would turn out to be Devitt's final NJPW match The midcard of the event featured a major storyline development involving the Bullet Club stable. One year after the break-up of Apollo 55, Bullet Club leader Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi faced off in a singles grudge match, during which The Young Bucks turned on Devitt, after he told them not to interfere in the match. After Taguchi had won the match, he and Devitt shook hands and ended their storyline rivalry with each other. After the following match, A.J. Styles debuted as the newest member of Bullet Club, attacking IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada. The third title match saw Tomohiro Ishii defend the NEVER Openweight Championship against Tetsuya Naito. Following The New Beginning in Osaka, where Ishii defeated Naito to win the title, Naito had avenged the loss by defeating Ishii in both the first round of the 2014 New Japan Cup and a six-man tag team match, which set up the title rematch, where Ishii made his first successful defense. Following his win, Ishii was challenged by Kushida. The semi-main event featured Bullet Club representatives Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson defending the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Hirooki Goto and Katsuyori Shibata. The two teams previously faced off in a non-title match on March 5 at NJPW's 42nd anniversary event, where Goto and Shibata were victorious. In addition, Goto and Shibata eliminated both Gallows and Anderson from the 2014 New Japan Cup in their first round matches. Anderson and Gallows, however, were victorious in the title match, making their second successful defense. Finally, in the main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against previous champion Shinsuke Nakamura in a rematch of both January's Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome and February's The New Beginning in Hiroshima. Nakamura had earned the right to challenge for either the IWGP Intercontinental or the IWGP Heavyweight Championship after winning the 2014 New Japan Cup, but opted to try to end his two-match losing streak against Tanahashi. In the end, Nakamura was victorious, winning the IWGP Intercontinental Championship for the third time. Post-match, Nakamura was challenged by Daniel and Rolles Gracie, while Kazushi Sakuraba offered to form a tag team with him. Aftermath The day after Invasion Attack 2014, NJPW announced Prince Devitt's resignation from the promotion, while also naming Ryusuke Taguchi and A.J. Styles the number one contenders to the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and Heavyweight Championships, respectively.

Event The first title match, where Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida) successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi), led to a major storyline development, when Devitt turned on Taguchi after the match and joined forces with the returning King Fale, now renamed \\"Bad Luck Fale\\". The turn led to the formation of Bullet Club later in the year. In the second title match, NJPW wrestler Tama Tonga and CMLL wrestler El Terrible successfully defended the CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) duo of La M√°scara and Valiente. The sixth match of the event, a tag team grudge match between the teams of Hirooki Goto and Yuji Nagata and Laughter7 (Katsuyori Shibata and Kazushi Sakuraba) had to be ended early, when Sakuraba dislocated his right elbow, which would sideline him for the next three months.

The Gracies won the match, after which Daniel challenged Nakamura to a title match. The main event featured Kazuchika Okada defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against A.J. Styles, who debuted at Invasion Attack 2014 by attacking Okada and revealing himself as the newest member of Bullet Club. At the end of the match, Yujiro Takahashi, who had recently started a storyline, where he began showing disgruntlement towards his current position in NJPW and started walking out on his tag team matches alongside his Chaos stablemates, turned on Okada and the stable and helped Styles win the match and become the 60th IWGP Heavyweight Champion. With the win, Styles became the sixth foreigner to win NJPW's top title.

Background The founder of the family was Peder Mikaelsson (c. 1560‚Äì1646), the Governor of Borgholm Castle. He fought for King Sigismund at St√•ngebro in 1598 and was knighted in 1610 with the name of Hammarski√∂ld. He was married twice. His first wife was Beata K√∂rning, daughter of the slottslov (\\"castle commander\\") Erik Matsson K√∂rning and Kjerstin Hand. His second wife, a cousin of Beata, was Christina Stjerna, the daughter of Peder M√•nsson Stjerna (number 77 in Riddarhuset) and Karin Hand. The two marriages produced children but the issue from his first wife went out early on the \\"sword side\\" (sv√§rdssidan, literally \\"on the side of the sword\\" meaning without any male heirs). As early as 1607 Peder Mikaelsson Hammarski√∂ld received as his properties the manors in the present Oskarshamn Municipality ‚Äì Misterhult, Virbo and F√•rbo ‚Äì and, in the present Vimmerby Municipality, Tuna, all in the modern Kalmar County for providing five fully armed men for the defense. Tuna is still a family estate for the Hammarskj√∂lds, and the church there houses the family mausoleum for them. The family was introduced to Riddarhuset in 1628. The son of the second marriage, Major Arvid Hammarskj√∂ld, married Anna Dorothea Patkull. The Hammarskj√∂ld dynasty continued with their son, Colonel Carl Gustaf Hammarskj√∂ld, who married Baroness Hedvig Ulfsparre of Broxvik, whose mother belonged to the Stake family (number 47 in Riddarhuset). A younger branch of the family has been partners and managing directors of Skultuna Messingbruk, a Swedish manufacturer of cuff links in Skultuna near V√§ster√•s in V√§stmanland, by intermarriage with the Adlerwald family.

Started in 1989, the carnival is now considered to be one of the premier busker carnivals not just in Canada but around the world. Nearly 80 thousand people attend the 4-day event held during the last week in August.  History  The very first busker festival in Waterloo ran from September 7 to 10 in 1989. It was meant to be a teaser to the 100th Anniversary of the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce in August 1990. It was a result of a visit to Halifax in 1988 by Dave Sandrock, President of Waterloo Bedding and head of the chamber's tourism committee, where he saw the International Busker Festival. 60 buskers performed over 17 days. As a result, the Waterloo Busker Carnival was produced by Buskers International Festivals Inc. from Halifax. The local committee members included such notables in the community as Dale Wilcox (Fairway Group), Bill Renauld (Newtex Cleaners), Alan Chalmers (Forbes Motors), and Jim Brickman (Brick Brewing Company). The first busker carnival was well received. The 3rd annual Waterloo Busker Carnival was trimmed back to a 4-day event from August 22 to 25, 1991, and 19 busker acts. A new logo with the busker face and juggling pins appeared for the first time on advertising and posters. On the Wednesday night August 26, 1998, the 10th anniversary of the carnival featured the very first Festival of Fools which was held at the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery. For $50 per ticket, attendees were treated to food, drink, and a chance to mingle with the buskers. The event was hosted by busker, Tawny Ross, now known as Aytahn of Acme Circus. In June 2011, the carnival announced a major change to its financial support. Sun Life Financial, a long-time sponsor, signed on to be the title sponsor for the next 3 years resulting in a name change to the Sun Life Financial Waterloo Busker Carnival. Sun Life Financial renewed its title sponsorship in 2013 for a new 3-year term from 2014 to 2016. On Thursday, August 23, 2012, Argentina's Victor Rubilar, 4-time Guinness World Record Holder, unofficially set a new Guinness World Record for the most soccer ball face rolls at the Opening Ceremonies of the 24th carnival.  25th Anniversary Celebration ‚ÄìAugust 22nd to 25th, 2013 = Opening Ceremonies = Steven Page opens the 25th Anniversary of the carnival. The Barenaked Ladies were original buskers from the 2nd carnival in 1990. This led to former BNL front man, Steven Page, and early in 2013, the contract was signed for him to open the carnival. On Thursday, August 22, 2013 at 6:30pm, Steven Page performed for a packed Waterloo Public Square and launched the 25th anniversary with a one-hour-long free concert. Supported by Canadian cello player and composer, Kevin Fox, Steven Page performed BNL favourites that he authored as well as new songs from his solo act. = Festival of Fools = On the evening of Wednesday, August 21, 2013, the Festival of Fools celebrated 15 years of raising funds for the carnival at the RIM Park Sportsplex Complex of the City of Waterloo. It was hosted by 25-year veteran, David Aiken (Checkerboard Guy) ‚Äì a busker from the very first carnival in Waterloo. The show featured a series of 10-minute performances by the Busker Fan Favourites from the past 25 years. = Special Recognition Awards = 25th Anniversary Special Recognition Award presented to Tracey Johnston-Aldworth Special Recognition Awards for Dedication and Support throughout 25 years of the carnival were presented to the City of Waterloo, UpTown Waterloo, CTV Kitchener, Airways Transit, and Sun Life Financial. Two more of these awards were presented to Waterloo Busker Carnival committee members who each had 24 consecutive years of service: Tracey Johnston-Aldworth joined the busker carnival committee in 1990 for the second carnival and served in various roles including Chair throughout the 24 years. Her company, Traces Screen Printing Limited has sponsored the carnival throughout that time. Her ongoing participation with the Waterloo Busker Carnival, her 1994 Environmental Achievement Award from the Kitchener-Waterloo Chamber of Commerce, and her 1995 Environmental Award from the Region of Waterloo for leading environmental practices at Traces Screen Printing Limited contributed to being recognized with The Waterloo Award in 1998 ‚Äì the City of Waterloo's highest civic honour for contributing to the community without any personal gain. In 2001, she was awarded with an Environmental Sustainability Award from the Region of Waterloo for her ecology- friendly business. Randy Warren, consistently on the carnival committee since the 2nd carnival in 1990, was honoured with The Waterloo Award in 2008- the highest civic honour a person can receive from the City of Waterloo. Since 1989, Randy was a key player in contributing to the success of Waterloo Busker Carnival, by raising sponsorship dollars, procuring festival entertainment, organizing the Festival of Fools, and serving several times as chairperson of the carnival's executive committee. A 2003 graduate of Leadership Waterloo Region, Randy has since served on Leadership Waterloo Region committees.

Hallbera belonged to a wealthy and powerful Icelandic family. She was the daughter of Abbot √ûorsteinn Halld√≥rsson of Hestur and later St√≥r√≥lfshvoll and Ingiger√∞ur Filippusd√≥ttir of the Oddaverjar. Her sister, Gu√∞r√∫n √ûorsteinsd√≥ttir, was married to the chieftain Kolbeinn Bjarnason, but Hallbera's marital status prior to taking the habit is not mentioned in contemporary sources. She could have lived as a financially independent widow before turning to a religious life, as was not uncommon for aristocratic women in Iceland at the time. In 1295, Hallbera donated vast lands to the foundation of a convent for nuns of the order of Saint Benedict. This was to be one of only two convents open to females in medieval Iceland, both of which were closed during the Reformation. Hallbera is known to have served as abbess of Reynista√∞arklaustur from at least 1299 (until her death), but scholars √Årmann Jakobsson and √Åsd√≠s Egilsd√≥ttir also identify her as the \\"Sister Katr√≠n\\" who was Reynista√∞arklaustur's first abbess, arguing that Katr√≠n was Hallbera's religious name. Sister Katr√≠n otherwise served as abbess for only one year before vanishing from all sources. If Hallbera and Sister Krist√≠n are the same person, then she lived at Munka√æver√° as a nun or anchorite prior to the founding of Reynista√∞arklaustur and was an educated and literate woman for whom the religious name Katr√≠n (Catherine) would have been highly appropriate. Hallbera had a close professional relationship to the Bishops of Holar, Au√∞unn rau√∞i √ûorbergsson and L√°rent√≠us K√°lfsson, who respected her opinion. The latter dedicated several poems to her.

It existed on the territory of the island of Cuba from the 16th century until it was abolished by royal decree on October 7, 1886. The first organised slavery in Cuba was introduced by the Spanish colonialists who attacked and enslaved the island's indigenous people on a grand scale. Cuba's original population was eventually destroyed completely, partly due to lethal forced labor, in the course of the 1500s, and the colonialists were in need for new slave supplies to uphold their reign and production. More than a million African slaves were brought to Cuba as part of the Atlantic slave trade; Cuba did not end its participation in the slave trade until 1867. As the slaves outnumbered the European Cubans, a large proportion of Cubans are descended from these African slaves, perhaps as many as 65% of the population. Slavery in Cuba was particularly profitable for its slave owners after the Haitian Revolution; after 1804 the newly independent state of Haiti retreated from the global sugar market as its residents chose to focus on subsistence farming. Cuba took its place as the largest sugar producer. By the mid-19th century, due to the British pressure to abolish slavery, plantation owners transported more than 100,000 Chinese workers to the island. They were held in conditions not very different from those of African slaves. History Chattel slavery of people of African origin was introduced to Cuba by the Spanish in the 16th century, primarily to work sugar cane plantations on the island. In 1740 the Havana Company was formed to further stimulate the sugar industry by encouraging slave importation into the colony, however it was unsuccessful. In 1762, the British army, led by George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle, captured Havana as part of the Seven Years' War with France. During the year-long occupation of Cuba (Spain regained the island in 1763 by exchange of Florida with the British), the British colonists expanded the plantation system on the island and imported 4,000 African slaves as laborers. This was nearly 10% of all the slaves imported to the island during the previous 250 years.Childs, p. 24 The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba. The British freed 90 slaves who had sided with them during the invasion. When the island was returned to the Spanish, colonial official Juli√°n de Arriaga realized that slaves could become partisans of enemies who offered them freedom. The Spanish gave cartas de libertad and emancipated some two dozen slaves who had defended Havana against the British.Childs, p. 25 Following the example of the British, the Spanish Crown increased the imports of slaves in order to keep the loyalty of European-Cuban planters and to increase the revenues from the lucrative sugar trade, as the crop was much in demand.Childs, p. 26 In 1792 slaves of the French colony of Saint-Domingue began a revolution on the nearby island of Hispaniola; they finally gained independence in 1804. They declared the new republic as Haiti, the second in the Western Hemisphere and the first founded by former slaves. Cuban slaveholders watched these events, but took comfort in thinking the rebellion was the result of the radical politics in France during the French Revolution, when the government had abolished slavery in the colonies and then tried to reintroduce it.Childs, p. 30 As the new freedmen set up small subsistence farms in Haiti, Cuba's planters gained much of the sugar market formerly held by Saint-Domingue's large plantations.Childs, p. 35 As sugar expanded to dominate the economy in Cuba, planters greatly expanded their importing of slaves from Africa. As a result, ‚Äúbetween 1791 to 1805, 91,211 slaves enter the island through Havana‚Äù.Willis Fletcher Johnson. The History of Cuba, Volume IV, B.F. Buck Incorporated, 1920. Britain and Spain made a concerted effort to reform diplomatic ties under what is called the Anglo-Spanish Treaty (1817). Britain hoped to gain Cuban agreement to end the transatlantic slave trade. But, as recorded by legal trade documents, ‚Äú372,449 slaves were imported to Cuba before the slave trade legally ended, and at least 123,775 were imported between 1821 and 1853.‚ÄùHumboldt, Alexander. The Island of Cuba, New York: 1856, p. 221. http://www.latinamericanstudies.org The slave trade did not systematically end until chattel Cuban slavery was abolished by royal decree in 1886. In 1803, ships carried refugees to Cuba from Saint-Domingue; they were both white (European) and free people of color, fleeing the fierce violence of the revolution. Though all the passengers on board had been legally free under French law for years, and many mixed-race people were born free, upon their arrival the Cubans classified those of even partial African descent as slaves. The white passengers were allowed entry into Cuba, but those who were primarily African or mulatto (of mixed race) were restrained on the ship. It became a type of floating prison. Some of the white passengers had already claimed some of the blacks as slaves, effectively reinstating slavery on board. The refugees had sought safety in Cuba, but some found themselves entrapped by its system. The women of African descent and their children were particularly subject to being impressed into slavery.Freedom Papers, pp. 48‚Äì51 In the early 19th century, the Cuban planters, who relied almost exclusively on foreign slave traders to import slaves, closely followed the slave debates in Britain and the newly independent United States. In 1807, both Britain and the US banned the Atlantic slave trade, with the US ban taking effect in 1808.Childs, p. 29 The Cuban elites petitioned the Spanish Crown to create their own slave-trading company, and smugglers continued to ship slaves to the island when they could evade British and American patrols. While the slave trade ceased in other parts of the Atlantic, the Cuban slave trade continued until 1867: of the estimated million slaves that were brought to the Western Hemisphere from Africa, 85% were brought during the 19th century. During the 19th century, a total of more than 600,000 slaves were imported into Cuba. In March 1812, a series of revolts led by freed slave Jos√© Antonio Aponte erupted in the plantations of Cuba.Childs, p. 120 After the revolts were suppressed by the local militias armed by the government, hundreds of slaves were arrested, with many of the leaders being tried and executed.Childs, p. 121 Unlike in the rest of the Americas, in Cuba for most of the 19th century the European-descended elite did not form an anti-colonial movement. They worried that such action would encourage the slaves to form their own revolution and disrupt their dependence of slave labor at the plantations. Cuba did not gain independence from Spain until 1898.Childs, pp. 177‚Äì178 Condition of the slaves In 1789, the Spanish Crown led an effort to reform slavery, as the demand for slave labor in Cuba was growing. The Crown issued a decree, C√≥digo Negro Espa√±ol (Spanish Black Code), that specified food and clothing provisions, put limits on the number of work hours, limited punishments, required religious instruction, and protected marriages, forbidding the sale of young children away from their mothers. But planters often flouted the laws and protested against them. They considered the code a threat to their authority and an intrusion into their personal lives.Childs, p. 36 The slave owners did not protest against all the measures of the code, many of which, they argued, were already common practices. They objected to efforts to set limits on their ability to apply physical punishment. For instance, the Black Code limited whippings to 25 and required the whippings \\"not to cause serious bruises or bleeding\\". The slaveholders thought that the slaves would interpret these limits as weaknesses, ultimately leading to resistance. Another contested issue was the restriction of work hours \\"from sunrise to sunset.\\" Planters said that during the harvest season, the rapid cutting and processing of cane required 20-hour days.Childs, p. 37 Those slaves who worked on sugar plantations and in sugar mills were often subject to the harshest of conditions. The field work was rigorous manual labor which the slaves began at an early age. The work days lasted close to 20 hours during harvest and processing, including cultivating and cutting the crops, hauling wagons, and processing sugarcane with dangerous machinery. The slaves were forced to reside in barracoons, where they were crammed in and locked in by a padlock at night, getting about three and four hours of sleep. The conditions of the barracoons were harsh; they were highly unsanitary and extremely hot. Typically there was no ventilation; the only window was a small barred hole in the wall.Montejo pp. 80‚Äì82 Gendered slavery Cuba's slavery system was gendered in that some duties were performed only by male slaves, some only by female slaves. Female slaves in the city of Havana, from the sixteenth century onwards, performed duties such as operating the town taverns, eating houses, and lodges, as well as being laundresses and domestic laborers and servants. Female slaves were also forced to serve as sex slaves in the towns. (General History of the Caribbean, Vol III, p. 141). The society was patriarchal, which provided a framework for projecting gender roles on enslaved peoples. Just as the concept of male domination through ‚Äòmachismo‚Äô solidified, the concept of 'marianismo'Franklin, Sarah L. Women and Slavery in Nineteenth-century Colonial Cuba. Rochester Studies in African History and the Diaspora: 1st Edition. Rochester: University of Rochester Press, 2012 was associated with the position of free white women. Machismo and marianismo are two sides of the same coin: the white Cuban male was expected to express dominance in ventures within public spaces. Marianismo embraces the notion of private space for a woman's nature, such as through motherhood and elevating the honor of the householder. During this period of time white women dealt with submissive tools to use ‚Äúmodesty (or virtue)‚Äù in their favor. Though gender roles predominated in enslaved peoples' labor, historical narratives have been interpreted in traditional ways to highlight the role of male slave resistance while occluding that of enslaved women. Further studies show us that the relationship between gender and slave revolt was complex. For instance, the spark for the La Escalera conspiracy‚Äîthough marked in the historical record as due to an enslaved woman's betrayal‚Äîreveals more about the lived realities of machismo: > As December 1843 drew to a close, an enslaved woman in the Sabanilla > district named Polonia Gang√° shocked her master with the information that > his prized sugar property was about to be engulfed in open rebellion‚Ä¶ But > commencing the story of 1844 at the moment of Polonia‚Äôs declaration also > necessarily equates a woman‚Äôs betrayal.Finch, Aisha K. Rethinking Slave > Rebellion in Cuba: La Escalera and the Insurgencies of 1841-1844, Chapel > Hill: University of South Carolina Press, 2015. https://muse.jhu.edu. Machismo remembers this betrayal as the only possible reality for enslaved women's participation in insurrection. This is due to the association of rebellion with aggression and aggression with masculinity. But despite enslaved women being viewed through this limiting lens, these women were known to have played a key role in resistance. One of the most famous women slave resistance leaders was Carlota from 1843, who led a rebellion in the Triunvirate plantation in Matanzas, Cuba.Houser, Myra Ann. ‚ÄúAvenging Carlota in Africa: Angola and the memory of Cuban Slavery,‚Äù Atlantic Studies: Global Currents, Feb 13 2015. She is considered one of the pioneers in women's fight against slavery. There is an incident which was portrayed and occurring in the public eye nearly a hundred years later since Pepe AntonioEditores de redacci√≥n Tiempo21. ‚ÄúPepe Antonio, el primer guerrillero cubano, a 250 a√±os de su muerte,‚Äù Tiempo21. Julio 7 2012. http://www.tiempo21.cu in addition to the other slave resistances led by men. This gendered perspective is also seen not only in rebellions, but in resistance, such as through oral histories and newspaper advertisements about female runaway slaves.Lina Rodriguez. ‚ÄúFree Cuba: Runaway Slave Advertisements from Colonial Havana,‚Äù The Appendix. July 9, 2013. http://theappendix.net As in French colonies, some enslaved Cuban women gained freedom through relationships with white men and having their children. As in other Latin cultures, there were looser borders between white men and the mulatto or mixed-race population. Sometimes men who took slaves as wives or concubines freed both them and their children. As in New Orleans and Saint-Domingue, the free mixed-race people began to constitute another class between the ethnic Europeans and mass of African slaves. Freedmen or free people of color, generally of mixed race, came to represent 20% of the total Cuban population and 41% of the non-white Cuban population (General History of the Caribbean, Vol III, pp. 144‚Äì5).Knight pp. 144‚Äì5 Planters encouraged Afro- Cuban slaves to have children in order to reproduce their work force. The masters wanted to pair strong and large-built black men with healthy black women. They were placed in the barracoons and forced to have sex and offspring of ‚Äúbreed stock‚Äù children. The children sold for around 500 pesos. The planters needed children to be born to replace slaves who died under the harsh regime, but they also needed to continue importing slaves from Africa, as had been the case in Saint-Domingue. Sometimes if the overseers did not like the quality of children, they separated the parents and sent the mother back to working in the fields.Montejo p. 39 Both women and men were subject to violence and abuse. Slaves who misbehaved or disobeyed their masters were often placed in stocks in the boiler houses, where they were abandoned for days at a time. Such punishment was documented as long as two to three months. These wooden stocks were made in two types: lying-down or stand-up types. Women were punished even when pregnant. When subjected to whippings, they had to lay \\"face down over a scooped-out piece of round [earth] to protect their bellies.\\"Montejo p. 40 Some masters reportedly whipped pregnant women in the belly, often causing miscarriages. The wounds were treated with ‚Äúcompresses of tobacco leaves, urine and salt,\\" traditional remedies developed by the slaves.Montejo pp. 39‚Äì40 Literary legacy Click \\"show\\" to see the English translation for the poem \\"Ca√±a.\\" Slavery left a long-lasting mark on Cuba and has affected current society. Nicol√°s Guill√©n and Lydia Cabrera have dealt with the history of slavery in their literary works. Both writers were a part of the negrista or negrismo literary movement of the 20th century. This was a Hispanophone effort to reclaim Cuban blackness and connections to African culture, while expressing a new sensibility (it was a movement similar to the flowering of the American Harlem Renaissance in New York). Guill√©n, Cabrera, and their contemporaries revisited and tried to make sense of slavery and the crimes against the Afro-Cuban people, as well as celebrate the people who had survived and created their own culture.

The Cold War was an early factor, overtaken in recent years by United States distrust of China. The station has an international crew, with the use of their time, and that of equipment on the station, being governed by treaties between participant nations. Usage of crew and hardware Allocation of US Orbital Segment hardware usage between nations. There is no fixed percentage of ownership for the whole space station. Rather, Article 5 of the IGA sets forth that each partner shall retain jurisdiction and control over the elements it registers and over personnel in or on the Space Station who are its nationals. Therefore, for each ISS module only one partner retains sole ownership. Still, the agreements to use the space station facilities are more complex. The station is composed of two sides: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and U.S. Orbital Segment (USOS). * Russian Orbital Segment (mostly Russian ownership, except the Zarya module) **Zarya: first component of the Space Station, USSR/Russia-built, U.S. funded (hence U.S.-owned) **Zvezda: the functional center of the Russian portion, living quarters, Russia-owned **Pirs: airlock, docking, Russia-owned **Poisk: redundancy for Pirs, Russia-owned **Rassvet: storage, docking, Russia-owned * U.S. Orbital Segment (mixed U.S. and international ownership) **Columbus: 51% for ESA, 46.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA. **Kib≈ç: 51% for JAXA, 46.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA. **Destiny: 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA. **Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload & download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA. History In 1972 a milestone was reached in co- operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space with the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. The project occurred during a period of d√©tente between the two superpowers, and led in July 1975 to Soyuz 19 docking with an Apollo spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's Interkosmos program included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in crewed and uncrewed missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986, the USSR extended its co-operation to a dozen countries in the Mir program. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited Mir in the Shuttle‚ÄìMir program. In 1998, assembly of the space station began. On 28 January 1998, the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed. This governs ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply. The signatories were the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, a memoranda of understanding between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations. Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level. Dated January 29, 1998 In 2010, the ESA announced that European countries which were not already part of the program would be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period. In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the space agencies of Canada, Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the space station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020. The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012. By nation=Brazil= Brazil joined the ISS as a partner of the United States and this included a contract with NASA to supply hardware to the Space Station. In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to NASA ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS program. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor Embraer was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the program in 2007. Regardless, the first Brazilian astronaut, Marcos Pontes, was sent to ISS in April 2006 for a short stay during the Expedition 13 where he realized the Miss√£o Centen√°rio. This was Brazil's first space traveler and he returned to Earth safely. Pontes trained on the Space Shuttle and Soyuz, but ended up going up with the Russians, although he did work at the U.S. Johnson Space Center after returning to Earth. = China = China is not an ISS partner, and no Chinese nationals have been aboard. China has its own contemporary human space program, Project 921, and has carried out co-operation and exchanges with countries such as Russia and Germany in human and robotic space projects. China launched its first experimental space station, Tiangong 1, in September 2011, and has officially initiated the permanently crewed Chinese space station project. In 2007, Chinese vice-minister of science and technology Li Xueyong said that China would like to participate in the ISS. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other 4 partners that China be invited to join the partnership, but that this needs to be a collective decision by all the current partners. While ESA is open to China's inclusion, the US is against it. US concerns over the transfer of technology that could be used for military purposes echo similar concerns over Russia's participation prior to its membership. Concerns over Russian involvement were overcome and NASA became solely dependent upon Russian crew capsules when its shuttles were grounded after the Columbia accident in 2003, and again after its retirement in 2011.http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/102611_Gerstenmaier.pdf The Chinese government has voiced a belief that international exchanges and co-operation in the field of aerospace engineering should be intensified on the basis of mutual benefit, peaceful use and common development. China's crewed Shenzhou spacecraft use an APAS docking system, developed after a 1994‚Äì1995 deal for the transfer of Russian Soyuz spacecraft technology. Included in the agreement was training, provision of Soyuz capsules, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. American observers comment that Shenzhou spacecraft could dock at the ISS if it became politically feasible, whilst Chinese engineers say work would still be required on the rendezvous system. Shenzhou 7 passed within about 50 kilometres of the ISS. American co-operation with China in space is limited, though efforts have been made by both sides to improve relations, but in 2011 new American legislation further strengthened legal barriers to co-operation, preventing NASA co- operation with China or Chinese owned companies, even the expenditure of funds used to host Chinese visitors at NASA facilities, unless specifically authorized by new laws, at the same time China, Europe and Russia have a co- operative relationship in several space exploration projects. Between 2007 and 2011, the space agencies of Europe, Russia and China carried out the ground- based preparations in the Mars500 project, which complement the ISS-based preparations for a human mission to Mars. =India, South Korea= The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space research organisation ISRO announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 International Astronautical Congress that their nations wished to join the ISS program, with talks due to begin in 2010. =Italy= Italy has a contract with NASA to provide services to the station, and also takes part in the program directly via its membership in ESA.

Ratac Abbey was under jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar, though relations between Ratac abbots and Bar archbishops were not always good. Based on the charters issued to Ratac by the rulers of Serbia of Nemanjiƒá dynasty, Ratac had a hospital that provided treatment to people who lived in poverty. In the middle of the 15th century people infected with leprosy were treated in this hospital. The earliest source that mentions Ratas is from 1247, though it probably existed much earlier. On 15 March 1306 Stephen Uro≈° II Milutin of Serbia issued a charter to Ratac in which he appointed his son Stephen as his future successor. Building of the new church within the already existing monastic complex began in 1347. At the beginning of the First Scutari War Ratac was captured by Venetians. In 1407 representatives of the Venetian Republic and Bal≈°a III met on the territory in possession of Ratac in attempt to negotiate peace. During negotiations held in June 1408 Venetians insisted to keep Ratac in their possession. The Treaty of Vuƒçitrn, signed in Vuƒçitrn on 22 April 1426 between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate, formally ended the Second Scutari War. By this treaty Venice ceded Ratac to Serbian despotate. Ratac was included into the list of Serbian demands probably based on the pressure of the people from Bar on Serbian negotiators. Since 1443 it was again under Venetian control until 1571 when it was destroyed by the Ottomans. In the 15th century the abbot of Ratac monastery was ƒêorƒëe Pelinoviƒá, one of the most notable priests and businessmen of his time. Pelinoviƒá was not the only abbot of Ratac Abbey. According to one 1445 Venetian report, there were two abbots in Ratac who shared the income of the abbey. Pelinoviƒá managed to remove his colleague and continued to manage the monastery alone. He was succeeded by Petar Fortis.When in the late 16th century jurisdiction of the Benedictine monastery Ratac collapses the Orthodox rite began to strengthen in the area of Catholic parishes Spiƒç, Sozina and Kastel Lastva which were under jurisdiction of this monastery.

The plan spearheaded by Germany and Italy included a module which would be attached to Freedom, and with the capability to evolve into a full-fledged European orbital outpost before the end of the century. The space station was also going to tie the emerging European and Japanese national space programmes closer to the US-led project, thereby preventing those nations from becoming major, independent competitors too. In September 1993, American Vice-President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station, which eventually became the International Space Station. They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, that the United States would be involved in the Mir programme, including American Shuttles docking, in the Shuttle‚ÄìMir Programme. Mir-2 Buran spacecraft would have carried modules up to 30 tons to MIR-2. 80‚Äì100 ton modules could have used the Energia rocket without the orbiter. They are shown here at the 1989 Paris Air Show The Russian Orbital Segment (ROS or RS) is the eleventh Soviet-Russian space station. Mir (\\"Peace\\") and the ISS are successors to the Salyut (\\"Fireworks\\") and Almaz (\\"Diamond\\") stations. The first MIR-2 module was launched in 1986 by an Energia heavy-lift expendable launch system. The Energia's core stage and boosters worked properly, however the Polyus spacecraft fired its engines to insert itself into orbit whilst in an incorrect orientation due to a programming error, and re-entered the atmosphere. The planned station changed several times, but Zvezda was always the service module, containing the station's critical systems such as life support. The station would have used the Buran spaceplane and Proton rockets to lift new modules into orbit. The spaceframe of Zvezda, also called DOS-8 serial number 128, was completed in February 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by October 1986.Mir-2. Astronautix.com. Retrieved 8 October 2011. The Polyus module or spacecraft would have served as the FGB, a foundation which provides propulsion and guidance, but it lacks life support. Polyus was a satellite interceptor/destroyer, carrying a 1 megawatt carbon dioxide laser. The module had a length of almost and a diameter of , with a mass of nearly 80 t, and included two principal sections, the smallest, the functional service block (FGB), and the largest, the aim module. In 1983, the design was changed and the station would consist of Zvezda, followed by several 90 tonne modules and a truss structure similar to the current station. The draft was approved by NPO Energia Chief Semenov on 14 December 1987 and announced to the press as 'Mir-2' in January 1988. This station would be visited by the Soviet Buran, but mainly resupplied by Progress-M2 spacecraft. Orbital assembly of the station was expected to begin in 1993. In 1993 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a redesigned smaller Mir-2 was to be built whilst attached to Mir, just as OPSEK is being assembled whilst attached to the ISS.  Freedom  Space Station Freedom Approved by then-president Ronald Reagan and announced in the 1984 State of the Union Address, \\"We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain\\", the proposed Freedom changed considerably. NASA's first cost assessment in 1987 revealed the \\"Dual Keel\\" Station would cost $14.5 billion. This caused a political uproar in Congress, and NASA and Reagan Administration officials reached a compromise in March 1987 which allowed the agency to proceed with a cheaper $12.2-billion Phase One Station that could be completed after 10 or 11 Shuttle assembly flights. This design initially omitted the $3.4-billion 'Dual Keel' structure and half of the power generators. The new Space Station configuration was named Freedom by Reagan in June 1988. Originally, Freedom would have carried two 37.5 kW solar arrays. However, Congress quickly insisted on adding two more arrays for scientific users. The Space Station programme was plagued by conflicts during the entire 1984‚Äì1987 definition phase. In 1987, the Department of Defense (DoD) briefly demanded to have full access to the Station for military research, despite strong objections from NASA and the international partners. Besides the expected furore from the international partners, the DoD position sparked a shouting match between Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and powerful members of Congress that extended right up to the final Fiscal 1988 budget authorisation in July 1987. Reagan wanted to invite other NATO countries to participate in the US-led project, since the Soviet Union had been launching international crews to their Salyut space stations since 1971. At one point, then-anonymous disgruntled NASA employees calling themselves \\"Center for Strategic Space Studies\\" suggested that instead of building Freedom, NASA should take the back-up Skylab from display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington and launch that. An agreement signed in September 1988 allocated 97% of the US lab resources to NASA while the Canadian CSA would receive 3% in return for its contribution. Europe and Japan would retain 51% of their own laboratory modules. Six Americans and two international astronauts would be permanently based on Space Station Freedom. Several NASA Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and early 1990s included spacewalks to demonstrate and test space station construction techniques. =Kib≈ç= Kib≈ç development The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), christened Kib≈ç (\\"hope\\") in 1999, is Japan's first manned spacecraft. Kib≈ç consists of a pressurised laboratory dedicated to advanced technology experiments, education and art, a cargo bay, an unpressurised pallet for vacuum experiments in space, a robotic arm, and interorbital communication system. While the proposed space station was redesigned many times around Kib≈ç, the only significant change has been the placement of its ballistic shielding. Its final position at the front of the station increases the risk of damage from debris. The ESA and NASA, by contrast, both reduced the size of their laboratories over the course of the programme. The Japanese National Space Development Agency (NASDA) formally submitted the JEM proposal to NASA in March 1986, and by 1990 design work began. Constructed in the Tobishima Plant of Nagoya Aerospace Systems Works, by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kib≈ç made its way to the Tsukuba Space Center and in 2003 Kib≈ç was shipped, first by river barge and then by ship, to America. In 2010, Kib≈ç won the Good Design Award, a -year-old consumer and industry award which identifies the best of Japanese craftsmanship. In the 1980s Japan was working on the HOPE-X spaceplane, intended to launch on the H-II rocket. Depending on the configuration of the rocket, it would have a mass of between 10 and 20 tonnes, and be able to carry both crew and cargo. It would launch vertically and land horizontally. The programme was terminated by JAXA in 2003 after scale mockup testing.  Columbus  Columbus ISS module In 1987 the ESA approved the Columbus laboratory. 1988, Europe was working on several space projects including the Columbus module, the Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF), and the Polar Platform (PPF), supported by the Ariane 5 rocket and the Hermes spaceplane. The Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF) was an ESA programme to develop a space station that could be used for a variety of microgravity experiments while serving ESA's needs for an autonomous manned space platform. The MTFF would be a space station without long term life support, visited by short term crews to replenish and maintain experiments in a Zero-G environment free of vibrations caused by a permanent crew. The project was cancelled after budget constraints caused by German reunification. The Hermes spaceplane is comparable in function to the American and Soviet space shuttles, with a smaller crew of up to 6 (reduced to 3 with ejection seats after the Challenger disaster) and substantially smaller cargo capacity, 4,550 kg, comparable to ISS unmanned cargo ships. By 1991 the Columbus and Hermes pre-development activities were good enough to progress into full development, however profound geopolitical changes prompted examining broader international co-operation, in particular with the Russian Federation. ESA Member States approved the complete development of the Attached Pressurised Module (APM) and the Polar Platform (PPF) for Columbus, but the Man-Tended Free-Flyer (MTFF) was abandoned. The Hermes programme was reoriented into the Manned Space Transportation Programme (MSTP), and a three-year period extending from 1993 to 1995 was agreed on to define a future manned space transportation system in co-operation with Russia, including joint development and use of Mir-2.ESA MTFF-Derived Space Station.

Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336 (1976), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a United States District Court may not decline jurisdiction over a case that has properly been removed to it from state court on the ground that the court is backlogged with other cases, and that a District Court's refusal to hear a case on this ground may be reviewed by a writ of mandamus. Facts In 1973, two Kentucky citizens sued an Indiana corporation and one of its employees for damages caused by an automobile accident. The suit was initially filed in Kentucky state court, but because the parties were from different states, the defendants removed the case to a federal court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, based on diversity jurisdiction. The case was assigned to District Judge H. David Hermansdorfer. It was undisputed that the federal court had diversity jurisdiction over the action and that it had been properly removed to federal court under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1441 and 1446. However, Judge Hermansdorfer declined to entertain the case. He stated that his court was inundated with cases under the Black Lung Act, and that given the statutory priority accorded to criminal cases and Social Security and Black Lung cases, he would not be able to hear the case in a timely fashion. Finding that plaintiffs' rights would be impaired by a long delay in federal court and that defendants would not be prejudiced by having the case heard in state court, Judge Hermansdorfer remanded the case to state court. The defendants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus or of prohibition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, directing the District Court to vacate its order and retain the case. The Sixth Circuit dismissed the petition, relying on 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1447(d), which provides that with one inapplicable exception, \\"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\\" The defendants then sought review by the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court Justice Byron R. White wrote the opinion of the Court, which was joined by Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Lewis Powell. The Court first addressed whether section 1447(d) barred review of the District Court's removal order. In concluding that it did not, the Court reasoned that a District Court's power to remand a case derives from 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1447(c), which provides that \\"[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case.\\" Here, the District Court never found that this case had been removed to it \\"improvidently\\" or \\"without jurisdiction.\\" Rather, the district court remanded the case to state court based on its \\"heavy docket,\\" which was a consideration \\"wholly different from those upon which ¬ß 1447(c) permits remand.\\" Reviewing the history and language of the removal statute, the Court concluded that sections 1447(c) and (d) must be considered together, so that a remand order unauthorized under section 1447(c) is not subject to the limitation of review under section 1447(d). The Court then granted the writ of mandamus sought by the parties, because the District Court was required to entertain the removed action, and there was no other procedural means by which the parties could obtain review of its refusal to do so. Dissenting opinion Justice William Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Potter Stewart. In Rehnquist's view, the Court of Appeals correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to review the remand order under the express command of Section 1447(d).

Background  Wang Jianli was born in 871, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. It is known that he was from Yushe, but all that is known about his family background were the names of his great-grandfather Wang Qiu (), grandfather Wang Jia (), and father Wang Bian (). In his youth, he was said to be ferocious and not careful in his behavior.  During Jin and Later Tang = During Li Cunxu's reign = After Tang had fallen, Wang Jianli's home region came under the rule of Jin, and, at some point, after Li Siyuan, an adoptive brother of and general under Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, was commissioned as the prefect of Dai Prefecture (‰ª£Â∑û, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi),Li Siyuan became the prefect of Dai in 908, so that puts a timeframe as to when Wang came to serve under him. See History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 35. he became the disciplinary officer of LI Siyuan's army. At that time, Li Cunxu's capital was at Taiyuan, but the tombs of his grandfather Li Guochang and father Li Keyong were at Dai, so he often sent female servants to offer sacrifices to them. These female servants of the prince often disrupted the lives of the people of Dai, and Wang would arrest and whip them. When Li Cunxu heard of this, he was angry and wanted to kill Wang, but Li Siyuan interceded on his behalf, and he was spared. Wang thus became well known in the realm. Throughout Li Cunxu's reign, both as the Prince of Jin and later, after Li Cunxu established a new Later Tang as its emperor, whenever Li Siyuan received a new governorship assignment, he would take Wang with him and have Wang serve as a commander of his headquarters guard corps. In 926, when many mutinies rose against Li Cunxu's rule, Li Siyuan was also forced by his own soldiers into leading one of the rebellions, at Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei). At that time, as Li Siyuan was serving as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), his family members were at Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (), and Wang was serving as the headquarters guard commander there. To prevent the eunuch monitor of the army (whom Li Cunxu had commissioned) from killing Li Siyuan's family members, Wang preemptively killed the eunuch monitor and the soldiers under him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. He then gathered his troops and joined forces with Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke, and they then joined Li Siyuan on his march south toward the capital Luoyang. Shortly after, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself. Li Siyuan thereafter arrived at Luoyang and claimed imperial title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. = During Li Siyuan's reign = For his contributions to Li Siyuan's regime, Wang Jianli was initially made the deputy military governor of Chengde and given the honorary title of acting Situ (). Thereafter, in fairly short succession, he was made the acting military governor of Chengde, and then full military governor. He was also given the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () and the honorary title of acting Taiwei (). At that time, however, the imperial government was dominated by Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui. An disliked Wang, and therefore accused him of aligning with the semi-independent warlord Wang Du the military governor of neighboring Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei). Wang, in turn, accused An of being power hungry, requesting permission to head to Luoyang to personally discuss the matter with Li Siyuan. Li Siyuan agreed. Once Wang was at Luoyang, he accused An and Zhang Yanlang () the director of palace affairs and the acting director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies) of improperly close association (one of An's children had married one of Zhang's children) and monopolizing power. In anger, Li Siyuan initially wanted to send An and Zhang out of the imperial government to posts outside Luoyang and replace An with Wang, but changed his mind after the other director of palace affairs, Zhu Hongzhao, spoke on An's behalf. However, when Wang then asked to return to Chengde, Li Siyuan decided to keep him at Luoyang. He gave Wang the titles of You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)), Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)), and chancellor; he also made Wang the acting director of the three financial agencies, replacing Zhang. As Wang was illiterate, he tried to decline the directorship of the three financial agencies, but Li Siyuan refused.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 928, with An back in good graces of Li Siyuan's, Wang was sent out to serve as the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). In or around 930, he was moved to Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), but as he travelled from Pinglu to Zhaoyi, he went through Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, i.e., Yedu). As he did, An submitted an accusation to Li Siyuan that Wang was making statements at Wei that were affecting the people there. As a result, Li Siyuan ordered Wang into retirement, giving him the title of Taifu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277.Both the History of the Five Dynasties and New History of the Five Dynasties indicated that it was Wang himself who sought retirement because he felt squeezed out by An, but the Zizhi Tongjian account appeared to give a more plausible reason of his being forced into retirement; it also appeared more plausible that Wang would be given the grand retirement title of Taifu, rather than the lesser Taizi Shaobao (Â§™Â≠êÂ∞ë‰øù) as given by both the History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties, given that his honorary titles had been greater than that up to that point. See History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 91, and New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 46. In retirement, he made several requests to see the emperor, but was refused. He decided to, without permission, head to Luoyang and enter the rear tower in the palace to see Li Siyuan. He wept and said that he had not committed a crime, but had been falsely accused by An. Li Siyuan responded, \\"While serving as military governor, you had not done well. Would it really be just An Chonghui who accuses you?\\" Li Siyuan did not punish him, but gave him a gift of tea and sent him away.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 46. = After Li Siyuan's reign = It was not until after Li Siyuan had died and Li Congke were emperor (r. 934-936) that Li Congke recalled Wang Jianli back to active service, as the military governor of TianpIng Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). It was said that, as Wang Jianli was a long-time disciplinary officer, he was a harsh military governor, such that if there were wicked people in his realm, he would slaughter their entire families. This earned him the nickname of Wang Duodie (ÁéãÂûúÁñä, \\"Wang the Stacker\\"), referring to his executing people so much that the bodies stacked up. Later, when he heard that Li Congke was near defeat when his brother-in-law (Li Siyuan's son-in-law) Shi Jingtang rebelled against him, he took the chance to kill his deputy military governor Wang Yanyun () and a secretary, both of whom he disliked. This caused people to view him even more negatively.  During Later Jin  After Shi Jingtang successfully overthrew Li Congke and established his own Later Jin as its emperor in 936, Fang Zhiwen () the military governor of Pinglu happened to die at that tie, and Shi sent Wang Jianli to take his army to patrol the Pinglu region, apparently concerned that Fang's soldiers might mutiny.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Shortly after, Shi made him the military governor of Pinglu, and gave him the honorary titles of acting Taiwei and Zhongshu Ling (). It was said that by this point, Wang's disposition had changed, as he had become a Buddhist. He was generous to the monks and building temples, and his harsh nature had softened, with his no longer killing many people. His people thus became more comforted. In 937, Shi created Wang the Prince of Linzi. In 938, he changed Wang's title to Prince of Dongping. In 940, Wang went to then- capital Kaifeng to pay homage to the emperor. Shi stated, \\"He had already been like an older brother to me three decades ago. He will not be required to bow to me.\\" He thus granted Wang the permission to enter the palace in a litter, and when Wang entered the imperial meeting hall, he had two eunuchs support Wang's weight. This was considered a great honor. After meeting the emperor, Wang requested retirement, but Shi declined it, making him the military governor of Zhaoyi again. Shi also created him the Prince of Han. Further, as Wang's home county of Yushe was within Liao Prefecture (), Shi added Liao and Qin (Ê≤ÅÂ∑û, in modern Changzhi) to Zhaoyi's territory, so that his old neighborhood can be glorified.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Less than a month after Wang's arrival at Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (), there was a time when a meteorite fell into his mansion. Believing that this was a sign of his impending death, he drafted a will. He died shortly after, and was given posthumous honors.

Each is characterized by a shared modality (F-sharp Phrygian) and harmonic progression (Bm‚ÄìA7‚ÄìG‚ÄìF-sharp), but differ significantly with respect to rhythm and meter. Tarantas is a cante libre (or toque libre, if played as a solo), meaning that it lacks both a regular rhythmic pattern (comp√°s, in flamenco terminology) and a regular rhythmic unit (or beat). It can be sung or played, but not danced. Taranto, conversely, has a regular 2/4-meter, and is danceable. When played on, or accompanied by, the guitar, both palos have a unique and characteristic sound that is created, in part, by dissonances that result from the use of the guitar's first three open strings (E, B, and G, respectively), in combination with harmonies and melodies based on the F-sharp Phrygian mode.
