She was a candidate in the 2019 Dallas mayoral election. She was the SWP's nominee for Vice President in the 2008 United States presidential election, President in the 2016 United States presidential election as well as their nominee for President in 2020. Biography= Early life and candidacies = Originally from Indianapolis, Kennedy joined the socialist movement in 1973 in Louisville, Kentucky. She has worked in coal mines in Alabama, Colorado, Utah, and West Virginia. Today she works at a Walmart in Dallas. In 1977 she ran as the SWP candidate for mayor of Cleveland, Ohio against incumbent Republican Ralph Perk, garnering 1,225 votes and losing by a wide margin to Dennis Kucinich. She first joined the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1981, and was one of the leaders of a strike in Utah 2004, also being involved in litigation. In 2000, she ran for United States Senate as a certified write-in candidate in a race prompted by the death of candidate and former Governor of Missouri Mel Carnahan. = 2008 presidential election = As the vice-presidential nominee of two parties, Kennedy ran a campaign focused on the youth. There were two different candidates at the head of the ticket, Roger Calero and James Harris; Harris was an alternate in some states because Calero was constitutionally ineligible because he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States (holding a green card), and not a US citizen. They were the first pair to qualify for the ballot in Louisiana Calero/Kennedy won 5,127 votes and Harris/Kennedy 2,424. = 2016 presidential election = On February 12, 2016, Kennedy was announced as the nominee for president on the Socialist Workers Party ticket alongside Osborne Hart. Kennedy is the second woman to be the presidential nominee of the SWP, following Linda Jenness. She was on the ballot in eight states: Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Tennessee, Washington and New Jersey. = 2019 Dallas mayoral election = In January 2019, Kennedy declared her candidacy in the 2019 Dallas mayoral election, advocating for the improvement of the public transit system, a public jobs program to provide \\"union-scale wages\\", and for the Dallas Police Department to address claims of police brutality, pointing to the killing of Botham Jean as an example of such claims. She received 469 votes and finished in last place. =2020 presidential election= In February 2020, Kennedy was announced as her party's nominee for President. Her vice-presidential nominee is Malcolm Jarrett, an African-American activist and cook from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The two kicked off their campaign with speeches at campaign headquarters in Dallas on February 8.

Arulenus Rusticus attained a suffect consulship in the nundinium of September to December 92 with Gaius Julius Silanus as his colleague.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 191, 218 He was one of a group of Stoics who opposed the perceived tyranny and autocratic tendencies of certain emperors, known today as the Stoic Opposition. His contemporaries referred to him in varying ways. The Fasti of Potentia and Ostia call him Q. Arulenus Rusticus, while Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Dio Cassius call him Arulenus Rusticus or Rusticus Arulenus, yet Suetonius calls him Junius Rusticus. That his brother was a friend of Pliny the Younger named Junius Mauricus, the senator Junius Rusticus (attested as alive in AD 29) is commonly identified as his father, and Quintus Junius Rusticus (suffect consul in 133 and ordinary consul in 162) as his grandson, only increases the perplexity. In his monograph on Roman naming practices, Olli Salomies attempted to determine to which gens Arulenus Rusticus belonged --Aruleni or Junii--only to admit there is no better explanation than the suggestion of Ronald Syme that Arulenus \\"is either adoptive or maternal--and accorded preference to the indistinctive 'Iunius'\\".Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), pp. 150f  Life  Arulenus Rusticus was Tribune of the plebs in AD 66, in which year Thrasea was condemned to death by the Roman Senate; he would have placed his veto upon the senatus consultum, had not Thrasea prevented him, as he would only have brought certain destruction upon himself without saving the life of the defendant.Tacitus, Annales, XVI.26 He was praetor in the civil wars after the death of Nero (69 AD), when as one of the senate's ambassadors to the Flavian armies he was wounded by the soldiers of Petilius Cerialis.Tacitus, Historiae, III.80 Although Arulenus Rusticus attained a suffect consulship during the reign of Domitian, in the following year he was condemned to death because he wrote a panegyric to Thrasea. > When I was once lecturing in Rome, that famous Rusticus, whom Domitian later > killed through envy at his repute, was among my hearers, and a soldier came > through the audience and delivered to him a letter from the emperor. There > was a silence and I, too, made a pause, that he might read his letter; but > he refused and did not break the seal until I had finished my lecture and > the audience had dispersed. Because of this incident everyone admired the > dignity of the man. Suetonius attributes to him a panegyric on Helvidius Priscus, but the latter work was composed by Herennius Senecio, as we learn both from Tacitus and Pliny the Younger.

There is particular emphasis on behaviours that may be undesirable, threatening, or potentially dangerous to the conduct of military operations. Military psychology utilizes multiple psychology sub-disciplines to encourage resiliency among military troops and counteract enemy forces for military victories. The stressors and mental illnesses studied under military psychology are not specific to the military. However, soldiers often face unique combinations of stressors within combat and war settings, and may go on to experience stress-related psychiatric disorders. Specific examples of the issues faced by military personnel include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), guilt, family and partner difficulties, and nightmares and flashbacks. Applied military psychology is especially focused on counselling, and treatment of stress and fatigue of military personnel and their families. Role The military is a group of individuals who are usually trained and equipped to perform national security tasks in unique and often chaotic and trauma-filled situations. These situations can include the front-lines of battle, national emergencies, allied assistance, or the disaster response scenarios where they are providing relief-aid for the host populations of both friendly and enemy states. Though many psychologists may have a general understanding with regards to a humans response to traumatic situations, military psychologists are uniquely trained and experienced specialists in applied science and practice among this special population. While the soldiers may be providing direct aid to the victims of events, military psychologists are providing specialized aid to both soldiers, their families, and the victims of military operations as they cope with the often \\"normal\\" response or reaction to uncommon and abnormal circumstances. In addition to the specialized roles previously mentioned, military psychologists often study the dynamics, train people in, and consult on hostage negotiations. In some cases the psychologists might not be the one directly handling the hostage situation, but hostage negotiators find value in resolving the hostage crisis using many of the scientific principles that are derived from the science of psychology. In addition, many of the principles of the scientific discipline of clinical psychology have their roots in the work of the early military psychologists of World War II. Another common practice domain for military psychologists is in performing fitness for duty evaluations, especially in high risk and high reliability occupations. The set of unique challenges often faced by those in the military and the professions of arms such as: police, strategic security, and protective services personnel, the ability to perform reliable and accurate fitness for duty evaluations adds value and maximizes the human capital investment in the workplace by optimizing retention of the talents of active and prospective service men and women while minimizing risk in many areas including violence, mishap, and injury potential. The types of fitness evaluations include both basic entry examinations and career progression examinations such as those conducted when individuals are seeking promotion, higher-classification clearance status, and specialized, hazardous, and mission critical working conditions. When operational commanders become concerned about the impact of continuous, critical, and traumatic operations on those in their command, they often consult with a military psychologist. Military psychologists can assess, diagnose, treat and recommend the duty status most suitable for the optimal well-being of the individual, group, and organization. Events that affect the mental state, resilience or psychological assets and vulnerabilities of the warrior and the command are where military psychologists are most equipped to meet the unique challenges and provide expert care and consultation to preserve the behavioural health of the fighting force. The fitness evaluations might lead to command directed administrative actions or provide the information necessary to make decisions by a medical board or other tribunal and must be thoroughly conducted by non- biased individuals with the experience and training necessary to render a professional opinion that is critical to key decision makers. Military psychologists must be well versed in the art and science of psychology as specialized applied practice professionals. They must also be highly competent generalists in the military profession, and be able to understand both professions well enough to examine human behavior in the context of military operations. It takes the psychologist several years beyond the doctorate to develop the expertise necessary to understand how to integrate psychology with the complex needs of the military. Another very select and infrequent use of military psychology is in the interview of subjects, the interrogation of prisoners, and the vetting of those who may provide information of operational or intelligence value that would enhance outcomes of friendly military operations or reduce friendly and enemy casualties. Psychology's scientific principles applied here allow the interviewer, agent, or interrogator to get as much information as possible through non-invasive means without the need to resort to active measures or risk violating the rules of engagement, host nation agreements, international and military law or crossing the threshold of the Geneva Conventions' guidelines to which the United States and its allies subscribe, regardless of the status of many of the modern belligerent countries on the international laws and United Nations agreements. Area of study The goals and missions of current military psychologists have been retained over the years, varying with the focus and strength of intensity of research put forth into each sector. The need for mental health care is now an expected part of high-stress military environments. The importance and severity of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has gained more credibility than those suffering from it received in the past, and is being highlighted in treatment programs. More extensive post-deployment screenings take place now to home in on problematic recoveries that used to be passed unnoticed and untreated. = Terrorism = Terrorism and counterterrorism, information management, and psychological warfare are value-added roles for the applied aspects of military psychology that are developing. For instance, contrary to the common myths and stereotypes about modern terrorists, that tend portray them as mentally disturbed individuals; most terrorists are far from that typology according to studies conducted by behavioural and social scientists who have either directly interviewed and observed terrorists or conducted meta-analytic studies of terrorism and terrorists. Terrorists have tended to be from among the more well educated in their host countries. They often have developed a well thought out, but not very often publicized or well articulated, rigid ideology that provides the foundation for their strategy and tactics. Psychologically disturbed terrorists increase the risk of damage to the terror organization's strategic outcomes. As in any organization, mentally disturbed terrorists are a liability and the leaders of terrorist groups are well aware of the risks that these types of persons present. As any good organizational leader, the effective terrorist will try to recruit the best person for the job. It is doubtful that modern terrorist groups would adopt the affirmative action and other hiring practices dictated under employment laws in the United States or other Western countries. It is important to understand when and how the label of terrorism is applied because of its psychological impact as suggested above. The causes, goals, methodology, and strategy of the terrorist mindset is well suited for psychological inquiry and the development of the strategy and tactics used to confront it. Terrorism is an ideology that uses behavioral, emotional, and group dynamics, along with social and psychological principles to influence populations for political purposes. It is a form of psychological warfare. The terrorists are experts in the use of fear, violence, threats of violence and trauma in order to advance the political agenda. Terrorists seek psychological control and use violent behavior to cause the population to behave in ways that disrupt and destroy the existing political processes and symbols of political power. They control people by using deep primal emotions to elicit a reaction and shape behavior. The goal of a terrorist is to use violence to create the natural fear of death and dismemberment and use it to change or shape political behavior, control thought and modify speech. Military and operational psychologists are highly trained and experienced. They are experts equipped with the specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities in the art and science of the military and psychology professions that give them a great deal of potential in this unique operational environment.\\"Psychological Warfare and Terrorism\\" =Operational psychology= Operational psychology is a specialty within the field of psychology that applies behavioral science principles through the use of consultation to enable key decision makers to more effectively understand, develop, target, and influence an individual, group or organization to accomplish tactical, operational, or strategic objectives within the domain of national security or national defense. This is a relatively new sub-discipline that has been employed largely by psychologists and behavioral scientists in military, intelligence, and law enforcement arenas (although other areas of public safety employ psychologists in this capacity as well). While psychology has been utilized in non-health related fields for many decades, recent years have seen an increased focus on its national security applications. Examples of such applications include the development of counterinsurgency strategy through human profiling, interrogation and detention support, information-psychological operations, and the selection of personnel for specialized military or other public safety activities.Staal, M.A. & Stephenson, J.A. (2013). Operational Psychology Post-9/11: A Decade of Evolution. Military Psychology, 25(2), 93-104. DOI: 10.1037/h0094951Kennedy, C. H., & Williams, T. J. (2010). Operational psychology ethics: Addressing evolving dilemmas. In C. Kennedy and T. Williams (Eds.), The ethics of operational psychology. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Recently, operational psychology has been under increased scrutiny due to allegations of unethical conduct by some practitioners supporting military and law enforcement interrogations. As a result, a small group of psychologists have raised concerns about the ethics of such practice.Arrigo, J. M., Eidelson, R. J., & Bennett, R. (2012). Psychology under fire: Adversarial operational psychology and psychological ethics. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 18, 384–400. Supporters of operational psychology have responded by providing an ethical defense of such activity. They argue that the American Psychological Association's ethical code is sufficient to support operational psychologists in a number of activities (to include legal interrogation by the military and other law enforcement agencies).Staal, M. A., & Greene, C. (2015). An Examination of “Adversarial” Operational Psychology. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 21, 264–268.Staal, M. A., & Greene, C. (2015). Operational psychology: An ethical practice–A reply to Arrigo, Eidelson, and Rockwood (2015). Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 21, 279–281. =Tactical psychology= Tactical psychology is \\"a sharp focus on what soldiers do once they are in contact with the enemy...on what a front-line soldier can do to win a battle\\". It combines psychology and historical analysis (the application of statistics to military historical data) to find out how tactics make the enemy freeze, flee or fuss, instead of fight. Tactical psychology examines how techniques like suppressive fire, combined arms or flanking reduce the enemy's will to fight.Murray, L., Brains and Bullets: How Psychology Wins War (London: Biteback, 2013) =Health, organizational, and occupational psychology= Military psychologists perform work in a variety of areas, to include operating mental health and family counseling clinics, performing research to help select recruits for the armed forces, determining which recruits will be best suited for various military occupational specialties, and performing analysis on humanitarian and peacekeeping missions to determine procedures that could save military and civilian lives. Some military psychologists also work to improve the lives of service personnel and their families. Other military psychologists work with large social policy programs within the military that are designed to increase diversity and equal opportunity.\\"Division 19 – Society for Military Psychology\\", (2009). About Military Psychology. Retrieved 24 November 2009. More modern programs employ the skills and knowledge of military psychologists to address issues such as integrating diverse ethnic and racial groups into the military and reducing sexual assault and discrimination. Others assist in the employment of women in combat positions and other positions traditionally held by men. Some military psychologists help to utilize low-capability recruits and rehabilitate drug-addicted and wounded service members. They are in charge of drug testing and psychological treatment for lifestyle problems, such as alcohol and substance abuse. In modern times, the advisement of military psychologists are being heard and taken more seriously into consideration for national policy than ever before. There are now more psychologists employed by the U.S. Department of Defense than by any other organization in the world. Since the downsizing of the military in the 1990s, however, there has been a considerable reduction in psychological research and support in the armed forces as well. = Feminism = Women in military roles is an area of study receiving an increasing amount of attention. Currently women make up 10%-15% of the armed forces. As women tended to move to away from nursing and helping roles, increasing attention is given to how the brutal realities of combat would affect the women psychologically. Interesting research shows that, when affected, women tend to ask for help, more so than men, thus avoiding many of the long-term mental suffering that male soldiers face after their deployment has ended.http://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/advancesinsocialwork/article/download/1878/1961 History Psychological stress and disorders have always been a part of military life, especially during and after wartime, but the mental health section of military psychology has not always experienced the awareness it does now. Even in the present day there is much more research and awareness needed concerning this area. One of the first institutions created to care for military psychiatric patients was St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Formerly known as the United States Government Hospital for the Insane, the hospital was founded by the United States Congress in 1855 and is currently in a state of disrepair although operational, with revitalization plans scheduled to begin in 2010.Michels, K. (2004).\\" Intelligence Testing in the United States Military \\". Retrieved 29 October 2009.U.S. National Library of Medicine. (2006). \\"Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital\\". Retrieved 1 December 2009. =Early work= In 1890 James McKeen Cattell coined the term “mental tests”. Cattell studied under Wundt at Leipzig in Germany at one point during his life and strongly advocated for psychology to be viewed as a science on par with the physical and life sciences.Plucker, J. A. (Ed.). (2003). Human intelligence: Historical influences, current controversies, teaching resources. Retrieved 19 November 2009, from http://www.indiana.edu/~intell He promoted the need for standardization of procedures, use of norms, and advocated the use of statistical analysis to study individual differences. He was unwavering in his opposition to America's involvement in World War I. Lightner Witmer, who also spent some time working under Wundt, changed the scene for psychology forever from his position at the University of Pennsylvania when he coined the term “clinical psychology” and outlined a program of training and study.Grassetti, S. (2007). Lightner Witmer . Retrieved 3 December 2009. This model for clinical psychology is still followed in modern times. Eleven years later in 1907 Witmer founded the journal The Psychological Clinic. Also in 1907, a routine psychological screening plan for hospitalized psychiatric patients was developed by Shepard Ivory Franz, civilian research psychologist at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Two years later, under the leadership of William Alanson White, St. Elizabeth's Hospital became known for research and training of psychiatrists and military medical officers. In 1911 Hebert Butts, a navy medical officer stationed at St. Elizabeth's, published the first protocol for psychological screening of navy recruits based on Franz's work. =Intelligence testing in the U.S. military= Lewis M. Terman, a professor at Stanford University, revised the Binet-Simon Scale in 1916, renaming it the Stanford-Binet Revision. This test was the beginning of the “Intelligence Testing Movement” and was administered to over 170,000 soldiers in the United States Army during World War I. Yerkes published the results of these tests in 1921 in a document that became known as the Army Report. There were two tests that initially made up the intelligence tests for the military: Army Alpha and Army Beta tests. They were developed to evaluate vast numbers of military recruits that were both literate (Army Alpha tests) and illiterate (Army Beta tests). The Army Beta test were designed to “measure native intellectual capacity”. The Army Beta test also helped to test non-English speaking service members.\\"History of Military Testing\\", ASVAB. Retrieved 21 November 2009. The standardized intelligence and entrance tests that have been used for each military branch in the United States has transformed over the years. Finally, in 1974, “the Department of Defense decided that all Services should use Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for both screening enlistees and assigning them to military occupations. Combining selection and classification testing made the testing process more efficient. It also enabled the Services to improve the matching of applicants with available job positions and allowed job guarantees for those qualified”. This went fully into effect in 1976. =Yerkes and war= Robert M. Yerkes, while he was president of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1917, worked with Edward B. Titchener and a group of psychologists that were known as the “Experimentalists”. Their work resulted in formulating a plan for APA members to offer their professional services to the World War I effort, even though Yerkes was known for being opposed to America being involved in the war at all. It was decided that psychologists could provide support in developing methods for selection of recruits and treatment of war victims. This was spurred, in part, by America's growing interest in the work of Alfred Binet in France on mental measurement, as well as the scientific management movement to enhance worker productivity. In 1919, Yerkes was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Service Corps. In a plan proposed to the Surgeon General, Yerkes wrote: \\"The Council of the American Psychological Association is convinced that in the present emergency American psychology can substantially serve the Government, under the medical corps of the Army and Navy, by examining recruits with respect to intellectual deficiency, psychopathic tendencies, nervous instability, and inadequate self-control\\". Also in 1919, the Army Division of Psychology in the Medical Department was established at the medical training camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia to train personnel to provide mental testing of large groups. This was also the era when the condition referred to as “shell shock” was first seriously studied by psychologists and standardized screening tests for pilots were administered.Xiao, H. (2007). \\"CWU Lecture to Outline History of Military Psychology \\", News and Headlines. Retrieved 24 November 2009. =World War II= World War II ushered in an era of substantial growth for the psychological field, centering around four major areas: testing for individual abilities, applied social psychology, instruction and training, and clinical psychology. During World War II, the Army General Classification Test (AGCT) and the Navy General Classification Test (NGCT) were used in place of the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for similar purposes. The United States Army had no unified program for the use of clinical psychologists until 1944, towards the end of World War II. Before this time, no clinical psychologists were serving in Army hospitals under the supervision of psychiatrists. This had to do with psychologists’ opposition to this type of service and also to the limited role the Army assigned to psychiatry. At this time, the only psychiatric interview that was being processed on the ever-increasing numbers of military recruits lasted only three minutes and could only manage to weed out the severely disturbed recruits. Under these conditions, it was impossible to determine which seemingly normal recruits would crack under the strain of military duties, and the need for clinical psychologists grew. By 1945 there were over 450 clinical psychologists serving in the U.S. Army. Military psychology matured well past the areas aforementioned that concerned psychologists up until this time, branching off into sectors that included military leadership, the effects of environmental factors on human performance, military intelligence, psychological operations and warfare (such as Special Forces like PSYOP), selection for special duties, and the influences of personal background, attitudes, and the work group on soldier motivation and morals. =Korean War= Korean War was the first war in which clinical psychologists served overseas, positioned in hospitals as well as combat zones. Their particular roles were vague, broad, and fairly undefined, except for the U.S. Air Force, which provided detailed job descriptions. The Air Force also outlined the standardized tests and procedures for evaluating recruits that were to be used. =Vietnam War= In the Vietnam War, there were significant challenges that obstructed the regular use of psychologists to support combat troops. The mental health teams were very small, usually only consisting of one psychiatrist, one psychologist, and three or four enlisted corpsmen. Quite often, medical officers, including psychologists, were working in severe conditions with little or no field experience. Despite these challenges, military psychiatry had improved compared to previous wars, which focused on maximizing function and minimizing disability by preventive and therapeutic measures. =Global War on Terror= A 2014 study of soldiers who had mental health problems after Overseas Contingency Operation service found that a majority of them had symptoms before they enlisted.

It was published in tankōbon format by Takeshobo in three volumes. Although there are traumatic references like suicide and lost love, the manga is still overall a light-hearted story of humor and hope. The series contains a great deal of R-rated sex. The magazine series was canceled in 2009 and the third collection is the last.  Plot  The story follows a young man named Amano Daikichi, who had recently lost his job and home and was forced to move into an abandoned apartment building known to be haunted by the ghost of a girl who had committed suicide 10 years before. Daikichi at first thought he had imagined the ghost when she first appeared, but begins to get to know her and learns her name is Kana. After a night of heavy drinking they discover that Daikichi is able to physically touch Kana instead of just passing through her \\"body\\" as when he first arrived. They begin a sexual relationship, and the story follows their budding romance as Daikichi begins to settle into his new home and start a new life.  Characters  ;Amano Daikichi :Although his name literally means \\"Good Luck\\", Daikichi feels he is incredibly unlucky. The story opens with him having just lost his job and apartment, which he doesn't mention in detail. Increasingly depressed, he is contemplating committing suicide when he moves into a dilapidated building known to be haunted where he meets Kana, the resident ghost. He and Kana quickly become close friends and lovers when she convinces him not to kill himself and they realize they can somehow touch each other. In later chapters of the story he attempts to learn more information about the person Kana used to be and ends up visiting a mass grave that supposedly contains the remains of Kana's human body. Daikichi is by nature a fairly laid back, quiet person, although he becomes a good deal more cheerful after meeting Kana. ;Kana :A ghost who was once a young woman who lived in the same apartment that Daikichi is currently squatting in. She committed suicide 10 years before the events of the story by repeatedly stabbing herself in the chest. Her only memories of her past life are that she killed herself on a warm summer day looking out at beautiful sunset. Although she can effortlessly go through walls and solid materials, she can still eat and drink, and she eventually learns how to wear new clothes. Her spiritual body is normally very cold in temperature, and she sometimes cools Diakichi off on a hot summer day by wrapping herself around him or chills drinks by holding them in her arms or against her chest. However, her body can also be quite warm, especially in the midst of passion. She encouraged Daikichi to continue to live on even when he felt he had reached rock bottom in his life. She can also get sick, where her body shrinks in the process. :At first Kana cannot leave the grounds of the apartment building, and thus her only outside source of info about the world is through television and magazines. However, after forcing herself out at the end of the first volume in order to save Daikichi's life she is able to roam freely. This in and of itself is no problem as it seems aside from Daikichi only animals, the very young, and very elderly are able to see Kana, though anyone can see things that she moves and feel her somewhat if they happen to touch her. On the other hand those around Daikichi tend to become rather confused as he appears to spend a lot of time talking to thin air. :When needing to rest or think in peace Kana embeds herself in a certain interior wall of the building, leaving a tell-tale smudge that resembles her face in profile on the drywall. Before she met Daikichi she would at times enter this wall for months on end to alleviate boredom and now may use it as a way of giving Daikichi the silent treatment if they have an argument. Despite (or perhaps due to) her manner of death (which happened so long ago she can't remember the reason) Kana has a very bubbly, positive and playful personality. ;Inagawa Goro :The manager at the local store that Daikichi goes to for groceries. He has a big interest in the supernatural and occult, and was surprised that Daikichi has suffered no harm while living in the aforementioned haunted apartment. He has lately become more interested in the building and has attempted to investigate it in person. Ironically as much as he loves the occult he also has an intense fear of it which has hindered his attempts to find out more about Daikichi's home. ;Yaguchi :The seemingly sole employee at the convenience store Daikichi goes to. She finds her boss' obsession with the paranormal odd, and scolds him for badgering Amano about his infamous residence when he comes by.

It was decided in relation to employees in the context of a company's insolvency proceedings. The case's practical significance was limited by cases and statute as in Re Horsley & Weight Ltd [1982] Ch 442 where the Court of Appeal held that a company's substantive object may include making gifts, and under Companies Act 2006, section 172 which entitles and obliges directors to regard interests other than shareholders as a proper exercise of their power. Facts According to the law report,(1883) LR 23 Ch D 654 Judgment Cotton LJ and Bowen LJ held that the money payment was invalid. Baggallay LJ dissented. In the course of his dicta, Bowen LJ held that there is.. So according to Bowen LJ, directors can only spend,(1883) LR 23 Ch D 654 The upshot for a company in insolvency was that directors were not free to make payments to employees, because payments could only be made which were incidental to the business, and an insolvent business had no further business. In English law, the position has been altered by the Insolvency Act 1986, s.187 and the Companies Act 2006, s.247, which allow directors to consider employees directly when a company has gone insolvent. Significance The value of the judgment today lies in the general doctrine that during the life of the company, it may conduct itself in a way which benefits stakeholders other than shareholders, but only insofar as that will in the end, albeit indirectly, be in the shareholders' interest. Cork Rail Case Clever and Progressive ,Caroline Madden, Irish times, 2 July 2012 See now, section 172 Companies Act 2006. Subsequent case law * (affirmed on other grounds in ) held that a company could be run with strict adherence to serving only the shareholders. *Evans v Brunner, Mond and Co Ltd [1921] 1 Ch 359, a chemical company’s general meeting approved directors donating £100,000 to universities for science. A shareholder challenged the resolution. He argued any benefit (a better pool of potential employees) was too remote. But he lost. *AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow, 39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) (appeal dismissed 346 U.S.C. 861 (1953)) the court applauded a gift to Princeton University as ‘long visioned… action in recognising and voluntarily discharging its high obligations as a constituent of our modern society.’ *Regentcrest plc v Cohen [2001] 2 BCLC 80, per Jonathan Parker LJ, at para 120, \\"No doubt, where it is clear that the act or omission under challenge resulted in substantial detriment to the company, the director will have a harder task persuading the court that he honestly believed it to be in the company's interest; but that does not detract from the subjective nature of the test.\\" But also, at para 153, \\"Thus, the need to avoid litigation against two of Regentcrest's directors was, I find, a weighty consideration, and one which could reasonably have led a businessman in the position of the Richardson brothers on 5 September 1990 to conclude that the waiver of the claim on the terms proposed was in the interests of Regentcrest, notwithstanding that the information before the board as to the vendors' ability to meet any judgment was far from complete. As to that, it is in my judgment wholly unrealistic to have expected Mr Roy Richardson at that stage to have initiated a detailed investigation into the personal financial circumstances of the vendors.\\" See also *UK company law Notes Category:1883 in case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:1883 in British law Category:Railway litigation in 1883 ","title":"Hutton v West Cork Rly Co"},{"id":"15059670","text":"Gmina Jaworze is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Bielsko County, Silesian Voivodeship, in southern Poland.

Beenie Man called Bogle \\"the greatest dancer of all time\\" and he is recognised as \\"part of the foundation and as an icon inside of dancehall culture.\\" Bogle created more dancehall moves than any other figure, he is best known for creating the Bogle dance which is named after him. His stage name, Bogle, is a reference to Paul Bogle a National Hero of Jamaica.  Early life  Gerald Levy was born on 22 August 1964 in Trenchtown, West Kingston in the capital of Jamaica. He was educated at Charlie Smith All Age and spent a brief period at St George's College. As a child in the 1970s he appeared on Louise Bennett's television show Ring Ding and in the 1980s he danced on the Saturday evening television programme Where It's At, both on the Jamaican Broadcasting Corporation.

Life Nerses Balients had been converted to Catholicism by the Dominicans.Mutafian, p.73 He was a member of the \\"United Brothers\\" (or \\"Unitarians\\") founded by the Dominican Barthelemy of Bologna, bishop of Maragha, which advocated a strict union of the Armenian Church with the Catholic Church. According to his writings, Nerses also used to call himself \\"Bishop of Urmia\\".Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Armeniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Armenie, p. 608 He visited Pope Clement V in Avignon and authored and translated various works while there. Writings Nerses Balients is the author of a history of the kings of Cilician Armenia, especially as regards their relations with the Mongols. Combination with Sempad Segments of the work of Nerses Balients have been inserted into Sempad's Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie, a version of which was compiled by the modern historian Edouard Dulaurier, who added information from Nerses Balients to expand on the period after Sempad's death.Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arméniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie, Original Controversy One challenged passageReuven-Amitai, \\"Mongol Raids into Palestine\\" in this work is where Nerses wrote that the Armenian King Hetoum II, during his 1299 offensives in Syria with the Mongols, went with a small force as far as the outskirts of Cairo, and then spent some fifteen days in Jerusalem visiting the Holy Places: Some historians considered Nerses Balient's statement as an indication that Mongols may have conquered, or at least been present in, Jerusalem in 1299. Claude Mutafian, in Le Royaume Arménien de Cilicie mentions the writings and the 14th century Armenian Dominican which claim that the Armenian king visited Jerusalem as it was temporarily removed from Muslim rule.Claude Mutafian, p.73 Alain Demurger, in Jacques de Molay, mentions the possibility that the Mongols may have occupied Jerusalem, quoting an Armenian tradition describing that Hethoum celebrated mass in Jerusalem in January 1300.Demurger, p.143 Some scholars, such as Dr. Sylvia Schein, have regarded this statement as an indication that Mongols may have been present in Jerusalem in 1299. In her 1991 book, Schein wrote that the Armenian information about Hetoum's visit was confirmed by Arab chroniclers.Schein, Fidelis Crucis, p. 163. \\"According to an Armenian source confirmed by Arab chroniclers, Hetoum II with a small force reached the outskirts of Cairo and then spent some fifteen days in Jerusalem visiting the Holy Places. However, other historians have strongly criticized Nerses Balienc's statement, and Schein's interpretation. Dr. Angus Donal Stewart in his 2001 book The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks, called the statement by Nerses Balienc an \\"absurd claim\\" from an unreliable source, and said that the Arab chroniclers did not confirm it in any way.Stewart, p. 14. \\"At one point, 'Arab chroniclers' are cited as being in support of an absurd claim made by a later Armenian source, but on inspection of the citations, they do no such thing.\\" Also Footnote #55, where Stewart further criticizes Schein's work: \\"The Armenian source cited is the RHC Arm. I version of the 'Chronicle of the Kingdom', but this passage was in fact inserted into the translation of the chronicle by its editor, Dulaurier, and originates in the (unreliable) work of Nerses Balienc... The \\"Arab chroniclers\\" cited are Mufaddal (actually a Copt; the edition of Blochet), al-Maqrizi (Quatremere's translation) and al-Nuwayrf. None of these sources confirm Nerses' story in any way; in fact, as is not made clear in the relevant [Schein] footnote, it is not the text of al-Nuwayrf that is cited, but D. P. Little's discussion of the writer in his Introduction to Mamluk Historiography (Montreal, 1970; 24-27), and in that there is absolutely no mention made of any Armenian involvement at all in the events of the year. It is disappointing to find such a cavalier attitude to the Arabic source material.\\" Another historian, Reuven Amitai, also did a detailed comparison of all of the available primary sources about the events around the Battle of Wadi al-Khazindar, and concluded that the Armenian account was in error, as it did not match up with other similar sources about the same events, was provably full of exaggerations and inaccuracies, and had been written as to glorify the Armenian king Hetoum. Amitai also pointed out that despite Schein's acceptance of the source as genuine, that even the original editor of the work, Edouard Dulaurier, had denied the veracity of the Armenian account.Mongol Raids, p. 246. \\"A less charitable attitude can be taken towards the other Armenian source, written by the anonymous continuator of Constable Smpad's work. His account is full of exaggerations and inaccuracies, the first of which is the year given for the campaign (751 of the Armenian calendar which equals 5 Jan. 1302 - 4 Jan. 1303). This unknown writer does not even mention Mulay or the Mongols in the raid into Palestine. In their stead only King Het'um of Armenia is found: after the victory of Hims, the king rushed forward to pursue the fleeing sultan. He was joined by 4,000 of his troops. After eleven days of hard riding, Het'um arrived at a location near Cairo called Doli (which I cannot identify). Throughout the pursuit, the sultan was but 10-12 miles ahead of the king. The latter soon withdrew from Doli because he was afraid of being captured. On his return, Het'um entered Jerusalem and gathered all the Christians from the city who had hitherto hidden in caves. During the 15 days he spent in Jerusalem, Het'um performed magnificent Christian ceremonies and also received a patent from Ghazan granting him the city and its surroundings. Afterwards, Het'um left Jerusalem and rejoined Ghazan in Damascus, spending the rest of the winter with him. Even the editor of this work, Edouard Dulaurier, unequivocally denies the veracity of the account and writes that the author's purpose was to glorify King Het'um. There is little resemblance between the facts described here and the Mamluk works or even the account of the historian Het'um, who certainly cannot be accused of lacking a desire to eulogize the Armenian king. It is quite improbable that the Mamluk writers would have missed an opportunity to attack [the muslim] Ghazan for such a despicable action, i.e., abandoning Muslim territory, especially Jerusalem to Christian depredations.\\" In his work, Edouard Dulaurier actually writes that Nerses may have added a few fantastic details to exaggerate Hetoum's accomplishments somewhat, specifically disputing one instance in which Nerses claims that Hetoum went as far as Cairo, when Ghazan himself is known to have sent 15,000 men only as far as Gaza.Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arméniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie, p. 659-660 Note 1, p. 659: \\"The account of the battle of Homs, in which Ghazan routs the Egyptians, on December 23, 1299, can be compared with that of Hayton, De Tartare, cap. XLII, and the narration of M. d'Ohsson, Hist. des Mongols, liv. VI, Chap. vi, t. IV, p.233-240. It is obvious that Nerses Balients added here a few fantastic details, devised to enhance the role played by the king of Armenia Hetoum II, as an auxiliary of the Tartars. We can very certainly put in doubt the pursuing of the Egyptians by this prince, after the battle, as far as the place named Doli by the compiler, which he located near Cairo. Indeed, the Mongol general who had been dispatched with a body of 15,000 men to pursue Sultan Nacer, did not go farther than Gaza, and stopped at the desert limit between Syria and Egypt\\".

A photo he took when he was about 16, an aerial shot of football players, is archived in the George Eastman Collection in Rochester, New York. He assisted Arnold S. Eagle for three years as a photography teacher for the National Youth Administration. Corsini admired the work of Roy Stryker's Farm Security Administration photographers and aspired to the documentary style they practiced. He joined the Photo League in 1938, \\"the only free camera club in New York City\\", whose members were socially concerned photographers. After a stint with Life magazine, in 1943 Corsini joined the Standard Oil documentary project under Roy Stryker, where he worked longer than any other photographer. In 1950, he accompanied Stryker to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and assisted him as head of the photographic department at the Pittsburgh Photographic Library. There he chronicled the city's first Renaissance, which included redevelopment of the Point and construction of Gateway Center. He remained in Pittsburgh when the PPL disbanded to begin his own commercial photography business. Eventually became the official photographer for U.S. Steel. Corsini's work with U.S. Steel reflected the industry from labor to output, and included industrial and technical pieces. Corsini retired when he sold his studio in 1975, then joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University, where he taught for nine years. His photographic work is held, in addition to the Pittsburgh Photographic Library, by the University of Louisville Photographic Archives, the George Eastman House Photo Collection, and the Carnegie Museum of Art.

Built in 1849, it is an important local example of Greek Revival architecture. It served as a church until 1902, and as town hall until 1987. In the 1940s its interior was also adapted for use as a gymnasium. The building now houses the town library and archives.History On July 5, 2000, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The former Union Church stands in the village center of Columbia Falls, on the north side of Main Street, between Addison Street and the Pleasant River. It is a tall single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and a granite foundation. Its front facade is finished in matchboard, while the other sides are clapboarded. The building corners are pilastered, with an entablature extending across the top of the front and sides. The front has a centered entrance set in a three-bay recess with two tall Doric columns in front, and tall sash windows in the flanking bays, with pilasters at the corners of the recess. The gable above is fully pedimented, with a small arched louver at the center. A tower rises above, with a combination belfry and clock stage topped by a low crown and weathervane. The interior is largely the product of the buildings 1949-50 conversion into gymnasium, although some original Greek Revival window framing remains. The early history of the church is shrouded in mystery; it was dedicated in January 1841, and its designer and builder are not known. The bell in the tower is original, and the clock was added in 1889. Use of the building for religious purposes had declined by the early 20th century to the point that it was deeded to the town, apparently with the stipulation that its exterior remain unaltered. It served as the community's town hall until 1987, and was further adapted for use as a gymnasium by the local schools in 1949-50. These functions were moved to a modern facility in 1987. The building has since housed the town library and archives.

The trades were largely orchestrated by David Pajčin, an ex-Goldman Sachs trader who was subsequently ordered to pay nearly $28 million in fines and judgments by the SEC. Background David Pajčin was a Croatian trader who met Eugene Plotkin when both were employees of the investment bank Goldman Sachs. In 2004, Plotkin introduced Pajčin to his friend Stanislav Shpigelman, a Merrill Lynch investment banker, at a Russian day spa in lower Manhattan. Pajčin knew Jason Smith, a postal worker, from high school and was romantically involved with Monika Vujovic, also a Croatian immigrant who worked as an exotic dancer. Schemes Shpigelman provided Pajčin and Plotkin with tips on upcoming mergers and acquisitions in return for payoffs. The largest trades that netted the vast majority of the case's profits stemmed from a single tip from Shpigelman about the upcoming acquisition of Reebok by Adidas-Salomon AG. In addition to trading on tips from Shpigelman, Pajčin also traded on confidential information from Jason Smith, his high school friend, who was serving on a grand jury, and on non-public information from advance copies of Business Week provided by warehouse workers Nickolaus Shuster and Juan Renteria, who were paid by Pajčin and Plotkin for that information. Pajčin placed trades in his own account and in the accounts of his aunt, Sonja Antičević, and his girlfriend, Monika Vujovic, based on these tips. In addition, a number of other individuals, most of them Croatian nationals, placed trades based on tips received by Pajčin and Plotkin from their inside sources. Investigation The investigation of Pajčin began after regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission noticed suspicious timing and unusually high trading volume before a corporate acquisition announcement. Pajčin's aunt, Sonja Antičević, a 63-year-old retired tailor from Omiš, Croatia who was living on a pension of about $263 a month and occasionally working as a cleaning lady, was found to have bought $130,000 of Reebok call options in the 2 days before Reebok was taken over by Adidas-Salomon AG and captured a profit of more than $2 million on that investment. She subsequently told reporters that she \\"never bought a stock\\" and had \\"no idea how that works.\\" In total, 8,675 Reebok options were traded on the two days before the merger announcement, more than 50 times the usual amount. The SEC discovered that a number of accounts involved in trading Reebok options over those two days had made other parallel trades over the prior months. This included accounts belonging to Monika Vujovic and several other Croatian nationals. Pajčin was arrested and began to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Aftermath and Sentencing The SEC immediately froze the conspirators' bank accounts, seizing over $6 million of the proceeds from their trades. Pajčin was arrested in 2005 and cooperated with the government. Subsequently, all of his co-conspirators were arrested in 2006. After pleading guilty to charges in the case in 2008, Pajčin was sentenced to time served. Several months after his release, Pajčin broke the terms of his probation and fled the United States. A warrant was issued for his arrest in April 2008.

Early life Hopkinson was born in Delhi on June 16, 1880. His father, William Hopkinson, was then a sergeant instructor of volunteers at Allahabad. His mother, Agnes Hopkinson, may have been an Indian woman, who used a European name. Raised in India, he spoke Hindi, but did not speak Punjabi well. He turned to others for translation of materials written in the Gurmukhi script. Intelligence work In 1903 or 1904, he became an inspector of police in Calcutta. Hopkinson came to Canada in late 1907 or early 1908, officially on leave, but pursuing investigations for the Criminal Intelligence Department in India. In February 1909, he was hired by the Immigration Branch (part of the Department of the Interior), as an immigration inspector and interpreter. He later became chief assistant to the Canadian inspector of immigration. Hopkinson continued to work for the police in India. He reported to the Deputy Minister of the Interior in Ottawa and to J. A. Wallinger, Agent of the Government of India in London. He was also retained by the U.S. immigration service. By 1910 Hopkinson was actively involved in monitoring the Indian immigration and the nationalistic separatist opinions and outlets in North America, especially Canada, and was the principal agent responsible for comprehensive British intelligence in the Pacific coast. He openly attended public meetings in British Columbia and down the coast in Washington, Oregon and California, to gather information on Indian nationalists and separatists. He used a network of assets to provide additional information on various terrorist & separatist groups. During that time he was subjected to accusations of bribery and to threats by the objects of his intelligence work, although it has been stated that in fact this was done due to his refusal to accept bribes or to be threatened by these subjects. Hopkinson was successful in infiltrating the Ghadarite movement after its conception, and in 1914 he was involved in the Komagata Maru incident. Komagata Maru incident and aftermath During the incident, he acted as an interpreter for the Immigration Branch when passengers were questioned. In mid-July, 1914, prior to the departure of the Komagata Maru, a local Ghadarite, Mewa Singh, was arrested while re-entering Canada from Sumas, Washington, attempting to bring weapons into Canada. Hopkinson helped to secure his release with a minor fine. This further illustrated the integrity and upholding of the law by William C. Hopkinson - a life long policeman - to assist and help his Indian countrymen. On Aug. 31, 1914, one of Hopkinson's informants, Harnam Singh, was found murdered in Vancouver. On Sept. 3, 1914, another informant, Arjan Singh was shot dead in Vancouver. On Sept. 5, 1914, another informant, Bela Singh, was arrested and subsequently charged with murder for killing two local Ghaderites, in what he claimed was self-defense as he along with other law-abiding citizens were being murdered in a separatist effort to remove any informants that could interfere with their radical separatist efforts. Death On Oct. 21, 1914, Hopkinson attended the provincial courthouse on West Georgia Street in Vancouver. He was there to testify at Bela Singh's murder trial, where he was expected to give evidence concerning threats made against Bela Singh, including death threats made by one of the victims. While waiting outside a courtroom, Hopkinson was assassinated by Mewa Singh. For Bhai Mewa Singh the turning came on September 15, 1915 when he witnessed a man named Bela (who worked as an informant for the Canadian immigration department) enter the Gurdwara on West Second Avenue and was attached and forced to shoot two Sikhs: Bhai Bhag Singh and Bhai Battan Singh. Bhai Mewa Singh like many Sikhs was devastated by this event especially with their source of weapons cut off and he planned to testify in revenge. However, Bhai Mewa Singh Ji didn't waver; he testified in court that Bela had shot Bhai Bhag Singh Ji and Bhai Battan Singh Ji from behind without any prior provocation. After giving this testimony Bhai Mewa Singh Ji claimed he was threatened once again by a mole named Babu who worked for inspector Hopkinson, although no evidence of this ever was provided. Bhai Mewa Singh continued to make claims he was told that the next time he was seen walking the streets of Vancouver that he would be shot dead. Bhai Mewa Singh held inspector Hopkinson responsible for interfering in the efforts of the radical separatist group. And when Mr. Hopkinson was to appear in court on October 21, 1914 to testify in favor of Bela. Bhai Mewa Singh Ji went to court that same day and shot and killed inspector Hopkinson to prevent him from testifying. After shooting inspector Hopkinson, Bhai Mewa Singh dropped his weapons and surrendered to the authorities. Bhai Mewa Singh Ji was put on trial for the murder of Officer Hopkinson. The presiding judge found him guilty of killing an inspector and Bhai Mewa Singh Ji was sentenced to death by hanging. ReferencesBibliography * *. *. *. *.

Its lineage extends back to the Amerbach Cabinet, a collection of works by Hans Holbein purchased by the city of Basel in 1661, which made it the first municipally owned and therefore open to the public museum in the world. Its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span, from the early 15th century up to the immediate present. Its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind. These encompass: paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600, and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries. Collection The Kunstmuseum possesses the largest collection of works by the Holbein family. Further examples of Renaissance art include important pieces by such masters as Konrad Witz, Hans Baldung (called Grien), Martin Schongauer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Mathias Grünewald. The main features of the 17th and 18th centuries are the Flemish and Dutch schools (e.g. Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Jan Brueghel the Elder), German and Dutch still life painting. Key works from the 19th century include the Impressionists represented by Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne as well as the paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Switzerland’s Arnold Böcklin and Ferdinand Hodler. In the 20th century, the focus is on works of Cubism with Picasso, Braque and Juan Gris. Expressionism is represented by such figures as Edvard Munch, Franz Marc, Oskar Kokoschka and Emil Nolde. The collection also includes works from Constructivism, Dadaism and Surrealism and American art since 1950. Further highlights are the unique compilations of works from Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Paul Klee, Alberto Giacometti and Marc Chagall. In the realm of more recent and contemporary art, the collection maintains substantial bodies of work by Swiss, German, Italian, and American artists, including Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Georg Baselitz, A.R. Penck, Brice Marden, Bruce Nauman, Jonathan Borofsky, Roni Horn, Francesco Clemente, Mimmo Paladino, Enzo Cucchi, Martin Disler, Leiko Ikemura, Markus Raetz, Rosemarie Trockel and Robert Gober. In the year of 1939 a large body of work by German-Jewish artists, whose paintings were considered to be degenerate art by the Nazi-Regime in Germany could be saved by the Kunstmuseum, were brought to Switzerland and are on display in the museum up to this day. In 1967 the sale of the Pablo Picasso paintings Les deux frères (1906) and Arlequin assis (1923), which had been on loan for many years at the museum, was threatened. In a referendum the people of Basel approved a state loan of 6 million Swiss francs, and the citizens also collected 2.4 million francs to purchase the two paintings for the Kunstmuseum. Pablo Picasso was so moved by this that he donated four more works to the city: Homme, femme et enfant (1906), a sketch for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the two major late works Vénus et l'amour and Le couple (both from 1967), which the then museum director, Franz Meyer, was allowed to select himself in Pablo Picasso's studio. Finally, Maja Sacher-Stehlin supplemented this donation with the cubist work Le poète (1912).https://kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/exhibitions/2013/the-picassos-are-here! Buildings The new extension from 2016 The Kunstmuseum’s main building was designed and constructed 1931-1936 by architects Paul Bonatz and Rudolf Christ, adjacent to the former building of the Swiss National Bank in Basel. In 2008, the museum acquired land on the other side of Dufourstrasse and an architectural competition was held. With international star competitors, such as five Pritzker Prize laureates (Peter Zumthor, Zaha Hadid, Rafael Moneo, Tadao Ando and Jean Nouvel) — all pitching, eventually a young local firm, Christ & Gantenbein, won the project.Cilento, Karen (21 December 2009).

Founding editors were Gordon Giles, Kenny MacKenzie and Joe Murray. The proof issue appeared in October 1987 and contained some articles and poems that did not appear in official issues. West Coast Magazine (WCM) was initially funded by East Glasgow Gear Project and Glasgow City Council; ultimately funded by the Scottish Arts Council. WCM was probably the first Scottish literary magazine fully produced pre-press in-house to a professional standard, and was the forerunner, in this sense, for many similar Scottish literary publications that came after it. The main aim of West Coast was to help promote new writing, and more specifically, new writers in Scotland. However, it did not exclusively publish Scottish writers or writers resident in Scotland – writers from all over the world contributed to its content. Established writers such as Alasdair Gray (short fiction and poetry), Agnes Owens (short fiction and poetry), Janice Galloway (short fiction), Freddie Anderson, (articles and poetry), Alison Prince (poetry), Dominic Behan (poetry), James Kelman (interview and article), Jeff Torrington (short fiction), Kenneth White (poetry, articles), all of whom also provided great encouragement to the project. New writers who were beginning to produce works of note were featured, such as: Des Dillon (short fiction and poetry),Des Dillon http://www.booksfromscotland.com/Authors/Des-Dillon Brian Whittingham (poetry), Jim Ferguson (short fiction and poetry), Irvine Welsh (short fiction) and Graham Fulton (poetry), and Andrew M Forster (poetry) among others. WCM Production Team: John Cunningham (Proof-reader, Distribution and Reviewer), Jan Dalton (Administration, Proof-reader and Reviewer), Maud Devine (Proof-reader and Distribution), Gordon Giles (Typesetting, Layout and Reviewer), Kenny MacKenzie (Typesetting, Layout and Reviewer), Alan Mason (Design), Joe Murray (Typesetting, Layout and Reviewer), Tam O'Hara (Word Processing), Ellen Shearer (Word Processing). WCM Editorial Staff: due to work commitments Joe Murray left the magazine after helping to complete Issue Three but returned after the publication of Issue Four. Issue three was, essentially a double issue, but not published as such. Gordon Giles left during production of Issue Six to pursue a career in Community Education; leaving Kenny and Joe as editors. From Issue Nine till Issue Thirteen an editorial board chose most of the work for the magazine freeing up Joe and Kenny to pursue the creation of a new small publishing company called Media Bridge Ltd* in West Nile Street, Glasgow, which took on the production of West Coast Magazine. The editorial group consisted of Margaret Fulton Cook editor and for around two years, during this time John Cunningham, Graham Fulton, Ronnie Smith and Brian Whittingham were the editorial board with Joe Murray as managing editor. In 1992 the editorial board was disbanded and from Issue Fifteen through to 28, when West Coast Magazine ended, Joe Murray was managing editor with Brian Whittingham editor and Alan Mason as designer. WCM also produced many writers' events such as readings and talks – mainly in pubs and other public places – and produced all but one of the literary events for Glasgow's City of Culture festival in 1990. All of the poetry and poetry reviews published in West Coast Magazine can be found on the Scottish Poetry Library's websiteWCM Poetry Index at the Scottish Poetry Library http://slic1.cdlr.strath.ac.uk:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=11X96222M80I1.242868&menu;=search&aspect;=power&npp;=10&ipp;=20&spp;=20&profile;=spi&ri;=&term;=&index;=.SPITK&aspect;=power&term;=&index;=.SPIAK&term;=&index;=.SPISK&term;=West+Coast+Magazine&index;=.SPINUW&sort;=&x;=15&y;=12#focus *In 1991 Media Bridge Limited was formed by \\"WCM\\" editors, Joe Murray and Kenny MacKenzie – both of whom became directors of the company – West Coast Magazine became an imprint of Media Bridge with Kenny MacKenzie remaining a consultant editor. Media Bridge created the imprints: Taranis Books for fiction and Sirona Press for poetry. Sirona Press was never used for publishing and consequently all books were published under the Taranis imprint. The first six books published by Media Bridge Ltd were produced by Joe Murray with cover designs by Alan Mason. The company was successfully managed throughout that period by Kenny MacKenzie. Joe Murray left Media Bridge in 1992 to form the publishing design company, EM-DEE Productions, and WCM became an imprint of that company. After a dispute with Scottish Arts Council around how it funded small publishers, \\"WCM\\" published the final double issue (27–28) in 1998. Under the guidance of Kenny MacKenzie, Taranis Books went on to publish over two-dozen books before being put to sleep in 2000.

His grandfather was Abraham Van Buren, a son of John Beuren, a pupil of Herman Boerhaave, who emigrated to New York from Beuren, near Amsterdam, in 1700. Van Buren entered Yale College in 1834. Before graduation he left to take his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania, finishing his studies before the legal age at which a diploma could be awarded him. He spent some eighteen months in Paris and returned to receive his degree in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1840, with a graduation thesis on \\"The Starch and Dextrin Bandage\\", the technique of which he had learned in Paris. He entered the army, passing the highest competitive examination. In 1842 he married the daughter of Dr. Valentine Mott, and in 1845 received the appointment as pro-sector to the medical department of the University of New York under Dr. Mott. In 1852 he became professor of anatomy and remained in that position until the burning of the college building in 1865. He attempted to reorganize the university medical school after the fire, insisting on the erection of a building near Bellevue Hospital Center. His plans, all adopted later, being rejected, Dr. Van Buren resigned. In 1868 he became professor of surgery in the Bellevue Hospital Medical College, a position which he retained until his death. In 1854 he translated from the French Charles Morel's Histology, and afterwards, Bernard and Huette's Operative Surgery. This latter work was furnished by the United States Government to the army surgeons during the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln offered to make Van Buren Surgeon General at the time of the war, and on his refusal consulted him with regard to the appointment. In 1865 he published Contributions to Practical Surgery, in 1870 Lectures on Diseases of the Rectum, and in 1874, in conjunction with Dr. Edward L. Keyes, a textbook on genito-urinary surgery. His contributions to medical periodical literature were frequent. He became a Catholic early in his medical career and remained one for the rest of his life. He was consulting surgeon to many of the prominent New York City hospitals, and had been president of the Pathological Society, vice-president of the New York Academy of Medicine, and corresponding member of the Société de Chirurgie of Paris, an honour that had been conferred on only one American before him.

Overview Sterlite operated the largest copper smelter plant in India, in Thoothukudi from 1998 to 2018. This plant was shut down by the Government of Tamil Nadu on 28 May 2018 after protests from locals but not operational from March 2018. The plant also included a refinery, a phosphoric acid plant and a sulphuric acid plant. The company's main operating subsidiaries are Hindustan Zinc Limited for its zinc and lead operations; Copper Mines of Tasmania Pty Limited for its copper operations in Australia; and Bharat Aluminium Company Limited for its aluminium operations. It also operates a copper mine in Australia. On 23 Feb 2001, Sterlite bought 51% stake in Bharat Aluminium Co. from the government of India by $118.5 million. In September 2013, SESA Goa, Sterlite Industries and Vedanta Aluminium merged to form Sesa Sterlite Limited.  Controversies  In 2001, Sterlite industries, BPL and Videocon were found guilty by SEBI of having colluded with Harshad Mehta and 17 brokers (10 from BSE and 7 from NSE) in a bid to corner shares and rig shares prices. This resulted in a ban on the company from accessing capital markets for 2 years. In 2003, Vedanta Resources (UK) was listed on the London Stock Exchange in the second largest floatation of the year in LSE. Vedanta Resources is a holding company that owns many entities including a large proportion of Vedanta Limited and Sterlite industries. The Thoothukudi Copper Smelting plant has been long-opposed by the local residents for polluting their environment as well as causing a range of health problems and has been subject to several closures, on grounds of violating environmental norms. The National Environmental Research Institute (NEERI) and the TNPCB have found evidence that Sterlite contaminated the groundwater, air and soil with its effluents and also violated standards of operation. In 2010, the Madras High Court had ordered a shut down of the same plant, for violating environmental regulations which was subsequently challenged by the group in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in April, 2013 struck down the Madras high court's order and instead fined Sterlite Rs 100 crore for polluting the environment and for operating the plant without a renewal of the consents by TNPCB. Post a favorable ruling by the National Green Tribunal, the plant soon reopened. In the meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on March, 2013 re-ordered a closure of the plant on grounds of leakage of gas, leading to nausea and skin irritation among local inhabitants. The group has steadfastly denied accusations of any wrongdoing, throughout. In March and April 2018, there were renewed mass-protests against the company's plans of setting up a second smelting complex and demands of an entire shutdown of the smelting plants, on grounds of violating environmental regulations were raised. On 22 May 2018 the protests took a deadlier when 20,000 protesters turned violent and subsequently police had to resort to lathi charge and shooting. In the event referred to as Thoothukudi violence 14 people were killed and several others injured. Section 144 was imposed to control the situation. On 28 May 2018, the Government of Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi. This action of TN Government was set aside by NGT on 15 December 2018, directing the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to pass fresh order of renewal of consent and authorization to handle hazardous substances. Though the Supreme Court of India set aside these directions on appeal by TN Government, Justices R F Nariman and Naveen Sinha held on 18 February 2019 that the NGT had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter.

The Baron of Sorrento was often called \\"Giancarlo\\" or \\"Gian Carlo\\", short for Giovanni Carlo. Count of Matera The Baron Giovanni Carlo Tramontano of Sorrento was on October 1, 1497, given the city of Matera in the Southern Italy region of Basilicata as his county by the King in Naples, Ferdinand II of Aragon. Giancarlo Baron Tramontano was given the title Count of Matera and built the famous Castello Tramontano (\\"Castle Tramontano\\"). A visit in Naples After 9 years as the ruler of Matera the Count almost lost his power in 1506. King Ferdinand II did announce on October 9, 1506 that he intended to remove counties and baronies from several counts and barons in the kingdom because he wanted to give them to a group of Spanish noblemen. In hope of being able to keep his county Count Giovanni Carlo and his wife Countess Elisabetta Restigliano went to the royal court in Naples where the Countess gave the Queen a gold necklace with 25 very valuable pearls worth 700 ducats. As a result, the King permitted Count Gian Carlo Tramontano of Matera to keep his county. The people rebel Castello Tramontano (Castle Tramontano) The aristocracy and the people of Matera considered the Count arrogant, a tyrant and a ruler without mercy—especially because he demanded a lot of taxes from the people so that he could live in luxury. On December 28, 1514 the Count demanded that the aristocracy and the people pay him 24.000 ducates—so that the Count could pay his debts. The people wouldn't accept this. On December 29, 1514, Count Giancarlo and his wife Countess Elisabetta went to mass. When the Count and the Countess came out of the church the Count was beaten to death by a group of rebellious men. The Countess was allowed to escape. After the murder the church bells rang constantly to mark the death of the Count. The people of Matera celebrated this event. The King in Naples considered the murder of Count Gian Carlo a political assassination and a way to hit the throne. Therefore, he sent a commissary to Matera to solve the crime. Four innocent men were hanged but the guilty criminals were never found.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara.  Location  Bulbulder is located in the western section of Zvezdara municipality, some 2.5 kilometers east from downtown Belgrade (Terazije). It spreads mostly between the streets of Dimitrija Tucovića on the south and Svetog Nikole on the north. It borders the neighborhood of Đeram on the south, Slavujev Venac on the west, Belgrade New Cemetery on the north- west, Zvezdara II on the north and Zvezdara itself on the east.  Name  The neighborhood's name means \\"nightingale valley\\" and comes from Turkish words bülbül, nightingale, and dere, valley. Apparently, the entire surrounding area was populated by nightingales, as the neighboring areas are called Slavujev Venac and Slavujev Potok (Serbian for \\"nightingale's circle\\" and \\"nightingale's creek\\", respectively).  History = Pre-19th century = In the 17th century. the Ottomans built a water supply system in the area, the Bulbulder waterworks. It was made from the short, baked-earth pipes (čunak). In the 18th century, Austrian occupational administration built the Town's waterworks. With the oldest, Mokri Lug waterworks, all three merged into the single system, which converged under the Terazije, where the water separating reservoir was built. When Belgrade was occupied in 1717 by the Austria, a defense moat was built whose outer section crossed the Veliki Vračar hill, where the modern Volgina Street is today. After Austria re-occupied Belgrade in 1789, the trench was reconstructed by the general Ernst Gideon von Laudon and became known as the \\"Laudan's trench\\" (Serbian: Laudanov šanac or simply Šanac). When Bulbulder developed later, this marked its easternmost extension, becoming known as the Baba Ruža's End. Chronicler Milan Milićević noted that during this Austrian occupation, Bulbulder for Belgraders had the function which in the early 1900s had Topčider: a green, forested excursion area just outside of the city. Also, it was the market place where more \\"exotic\\" goods could be purchased, like the \\"figs from the (Adriatic) sea\\" and \\"grapes from Mostar\\". = 19th century = The creek which used to flow through the neighborhood has been conducted underground into the sewage system. It was named Slavujev potok or Bulbulderski potok (Slavuj or Bulbulder Creek) and originated near the clinical center Zvezdara. It flew down in the direction of the moderns streets of Dimitrija Tucovića, Ruzveltova and Mije Kovačevića, before emptying into the Danube east of the present location of the Pančevo Bridge. At the modern corner of the Cvijićeva and Zdravka Čelara, there was a widening, where the creek would overspill and the pond would form. Local population came to the pond for harvesting reeds and shooting ducks. Historically, until World War I term Bulbulder was applied to the much wider area than the modern local community covers. It included the entire valley of the Bulbulder Creek with the Veliki Vračar hill, especially its right bank which would today also include Zvezdara Forest, Slavujev Venac, Slavujev Potok, Hadžipopovac and Profesorska Kolonija. In the 19th century, the upper section of the neighborhood had a string of brickworks which used the local clay. Major changes ensued after 1886 and construction of the Belgrade New Cemetery in the neighborhood. The main street which connected the neighborhood to the rest of Belgrade, Grobljanski Put (Cemetery Road, later street; renamed tp Ruzveltova in 1946) became much busier. In 1893, a tram line of public transportation was conducted through the street. Originally assigned No. 3, it was later changed to No. 8 and in 1949 it became No. 13. Because of this, a small bridge was built over the creek in the 19th century, on the route of the modern Ruzveltova Street, on the western border of the neighborhood, in the Slavujev Venac section. Original wooden bridge was replaced with the stone one in 1929, and today there is a modern overpass. The bridge was replaced mainly to make easier access to the cemetery, further down the Ruzveltova Street. Old bridge was often getting covered in ice during the winter and numerous accidents were recorded. = 20th century = Modern highrise along the Dimitrija Tucovića Street In the 19th and early 20th century, the area consisted of yards and gardens. Bulgarian settlers were cultivating vegetables, which was then directly sold on the wooden benches in front of the gardens. The settlement changed after the city cemetery was transferred from Tašmajdan to the northern section of the neighborhood as the Belgrade New Cemetery. The gardeners were transferred to Mirijevo, the creek was channeled and the construction of the houses began. On 15 July 1915, during the standstill in World War I, the drinking fountain was built at the spring of the Bulbulder Creek. It was dedicated to, and named after, the third-class reservists (Trećepozivačka česma). After the war ended, the quick development of the neighborhood ensued. From 1926 to 1927, a new residential neighborhood was built in the area bounded by the streets of Knez Miletina (today Despota Stefana Boulevard), Mitropolita Petra and Zdravka Čelara, and bz the Bulbulder Creek. One section was settled by the families of the Belgrade University professors and became a separate neighborhood of Profesorska Kolonija. However, the creek continued to flood the area, especially after heavy rains, cutting off the neighborhood completely from downtown. The drainage network was constructed and the creek was conducted underground by 1933. The second most important street in the neighborhood, opposite to the Grobljanska, was cut through by this time, too. Northern section, to the Đušina Street, was named Slavujska, while the southern was named Bulbulderska. Name change was proposed for the northern section which reached Profesorksa Kolonija, so it was renamed to Cvijićeva, after the professor and scientist Jovan Cvijić. The southern section was also renamed, to Tucovićeva (today Dimitrija Tucovića). Two main streets were meeting, but not crossing each other, being cut off from each other by the overpass. Works on the overpass, which allowed the crossing, were finished in December 1930. In 1927, the bus line of public transportation was established, which connected Profesorska Kolonija section with the Belgrade Main railway station. In the extreme east, on the Veliki Vračar hill, the Belgrade Observatory was built from 1929 to 1932. After the original Serbian name for the observatory, zvezdara (zvezda, star in Serbian) the hill and the entire neighborhood, and today municipality, are named Zvezdara. The hill was heavily forested and today is protected as the natural monument of Zvezdara Forest. By the 1930s, Bulbulder was fully integrated into the urban tissue of Belgrade. Industrialist Luka Milišić built a social housing block in Bulbulder during the Interbellum. He built it for the workers of his brickyard and the acetic acid factory. In this period, at 35 Grobljanska Street, the bus company of Ljubiša Perišić, which maintained the bus line in the neighborhood, built vast garage for its vehicles. It later became known as the Ford Garage. Construction of the City Hospital (today KBC Zvezdara) lasted from October 1933 to 1 December 1935. In the early 1941, before World War II began in Yugoslavia, the bus line No. 28 was established, which connected City Hospital to Theatre Square in downtown Belgrade. The Ford Garage was burned by the members of Communist youth organization SKOJ in the night of 26/27 July 1941, as the occupational German forces kept parked vehicles here. The line No. 28 was kept operational by the German authorities throughout the war, from 1941 to 1944.  Population  The neighborhood is mostly residential. According to the 2011 census, the population of the local community of the same name was 5,375, while with the local community of Slavujev Venac, population was 10,441.  Characteristics  Bulbulder is a working-class neighborhood which mostly consists of old, individual houses with yards and orchards (cherries, apricots). In the 2010s, especially along the Dimitrija Tucovića, old houses were demolished and new, tall buildings constructed. The neighborhood is known for its pigeonries and for the number of athletes and trainers who grew up in the area: Vladimir Petrović Pižon, Vladislav Bogićević, Dušan Nikolić, Dragoslav Stepanović, Petar Borota, Zoran Dimitrijević, Boško Kajganić (football), Jovica Cvetković, Milan Kalina (handball), Nebojša Prokić (boxing), Ljubomir Vračarević (Real Aikido), Jelena Janković (tennis). A large medical complex (KBC \\"Zvezdara\\", Anti-tuberculosis Clinic, etc.) is at the eastern end of the neighborhood, while the Orthodox church of Saint Prince Lazar is in the center. The church, colloquially called Lazarica, and the nearby street of Mehmed Paše Sokolovića, are considered as the center of the neighborhood.

Almería declared independence of its province from Caliphate of Cordoba around 1012. It remained as an independent kingdom, although several campaigns of the Taifa of Seville diminished its territory in the north. The kingdom was important due to its strategic location, its harbour, and a developed and very important textile industry, with around five thousand looms, being also a center of silk industry, which originated a very strong commerce with other parts of Europe and which remained until the Muslims were expelled in early 17th century. The emirs of Granada, Seville and Valencia tried to conquer the little Almería kingdom many times. However, it remained independent until the arrival of the Almoravid dynasty, except for a short period of Valencian occupation.

It has been said that with the defeat of Granada, twenty flags were conquered, eighteen of which were green and white striped. The flag of the taifa of Almeria remained the flag of the Castilian troops in Andalusia, and in the 19th century was adopted as the flag of the Andalusian nationalist movement agitating for regional autonomy within Spain. This flag became the official, current flag of Andalusia after enactment of the statute of autonomy in the early 1980s. When Abu Asbag ibn Arqam, a poet from Guadix who served as vizier of King al-Mu'tasim of Almería, saw the green and white flag on top of the Alcazaba of Almería, he wrote a poem which is regarded as the oldest written document describing a flag in Europe: > The green flag spread over you the wing of bliss, It made its wišāḥ of the > white morning glow; Its flutter makes it seem to be your foe's heart, > Whene'er the wind is striking it full; It guarantees to you good luck in > victory: Watch the good omen which forebodes success!

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara.  Location  Cvetko is located along the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, in the field south of Zvezdara hill, in the easternmost section of the former Vračar area (modern local community which covers the area of Cvetko is called Vračarsko polje, Vračar field). It is 3,5 kilometers south-east of downtown Belgrade (Terazije). It is centered on the green market and extends into the neighborhood of Konjarnik on the south and Lion on the west.  History & characteristics  In Roman period, when Belgrade was a fortified city of Singidunum, the area of the modern neighborhood was location of three water systems. In 1902 Belgrade's entrepreneur Cvetko Jovanović (originally from the Struga region) opened a kafana on the Smederevo road, across the Mokri Lug's farmers' market. He named it \\"Vračar Field\\", after the location. However, his venue became known as Cvetkova Mehana, and as he also owned neighboring lots, the area gradually became known under this name. Farmers market was in time also named after him, Cvetkova Pijaca (Serbian for Cvetko's market). In the 1930s, area of the modern Cvetkova Pijaca was the eastern edge of the city. Today, neighborhood is dominated by the open farmers' market, one of the major ones in Belgrade. The market, which originates from the late 1920s, is actually officially called \\"Zvezdara market\\" but the name didn't catch on. Being on the outskirts of the city, it was known for the goods from all over Serbia, especially cheese, wine and rakia. In 2011 it had over 400 market stalls. After World War I, the section near Olimp was settled by the Kalmyks from the shores of the Caspian Sea, which fled Imperial Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. In Budvanska street, they built Belgrade pagoda, a Mongolian-type Buddhist temple in 1929, which was abandoned in 1944 and demolished in the mid 1960s.Politika, 16 July 2007, p.25 In the eastern extension of the market, a row of six skyscrapers was built in 1955. Designed by Ivan Antić, the 12-story high buildings were the first highrise in Belgrade after World War II. They were built by the new techniques, including the climbing formwork, and started the fashion of highrise throughout he city. Other important nearby features are the sports center \\"Zvezdara\\" (popularly called Olimp, Olympus) and the theater \\"Zvezdara teatar\\". The population of the neighborhood was 4,843 by the 2002 census.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara.  Location  Đeram is located along Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, centered on the open greenmarket of the same name, in the eastern section of Zvezdara municipality, south-east of downtown Belgrade (Terazije). It borders the neighborhood of Crveni Krst on the south, Lipov Lad on the south-east, Lion on the east, Bulbuder and Slavujev Venac on the north and Vukov Spomenik on the west.  Administration  When Belgrade was divided into municipalities in 1952, a municipality of Stari Đeram (Old Đeram) was created. On 1 January 1957, that municipality was abolished and merged with Zvezdara. The neighborhood was later organized as two local communities (sub- municipal administrative unit), Stari Đeram and Smederevski Đeram (Smederevo Đeram). Stari Đeram was annexed to the local community of Vukov Spomenik in the 1980s.  Population  The municipality of Stari Đeram had a population of 27,595 by the 1953 census. Prior to becoming part of the Vukov Spomenik, local community Stari Đeram had a population of 4,488 in 1981. The remaining local community of Smederevski Đeram, which occupies much smaller area that the former municipality, had a population of 3,133 by the 2011 census.  Đeram Greenmarket  The main feature of the neighborhood is one of Belgrade's largest open greenmarkets, Đeram pijaca. In 1821, the state government decided to put the food trade in order and to establish the quantity and quality of the goods imported to the city. Part of the project was introduction of the excise on the goods (in Serbian called trošarina) and setting of a series of excise check points on the roads leading to the city. One of those check points, which all gradually also became known as trošarina, was on the Tsarigrad Road, later renamed Smederevo Road (modern Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra). As it had a ramp, it resembled the đeram, a cattle-drawn water well with a ramp, so it was named after it. As the name of the street was changed later, it became known as Smederevo Đeram. Gradually, an open greenmarket formed around it. It was to be renovated in 2008 and to become the first covered green market of that size in Belgrade. Though the project was not scrapped, as of October 2017 the reconstruction is still pending. Apart from that, the neighborhood is mainly residential with a strong commercial section along the boulevard, one of the main shopping areas in Belgrade.

It is divided between Belgrade's municipalities of Voždovac and Zvezdara (roughly Konjarnik I, Konjarnik II and Konjarnik III, respectively). As a large neighborhood, it has several sub-neighborhoods of its own, including Denkova Bašta, Učiteljsko Naselje and Rudo.  Location  Konjarnik begins 4 km south-east of downtown Belgrade (Terazije) and itself stretched for over 2 km, mostly along Ustanička street, right side of the Highway Belgrade–Niš and between Ustanička and Vojislava Ilića streets. It borders the neighborhoods of Dušanovac on the west, Šumice on the south-west, Cvetkova Pijaca on the north, Mali Mokri Lug on the east, while the entire southern border of Konjarnik is marked by the highway which divides it from the neighborhoods of Medaković III and Marinkova Bara. Westernmost section of Konjarnik belongs to the municipality of Voždovac, the rest is in Zvezdara.  History  After World War I, part of the neighborhood of Cvetkova Pijaca was settled by the Kalmyks from the shores of the Caspian Sea, which fled Imperial Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. In Budvanska street, they built Belgrade pagoda, a Mongolian-type Buddhist temple in 1929, which was abandoned in 1944 and demolished in the mid-1960s. They had vast horse herds which were kept and left to graze in the open area which gradually became known as Konjarnik (literally, horse breeding area).Politika, 16 July 16, 2007, p. 25 Building of a vast, modern neighborhood began in 1960s and continued in the 1970s, creating an urban connection between old Belgrade on the west and Mali Mokri Lug on the east. Population of Konjarnik was 23,394 in 2002 and 22,973 in 2011.  Sub-neighborhoods = Konjarnik I = Westernmost section of Konjarnik, located in the municipality of Voždovac, between the streets of Ustanička on the north, Belgrade-Niš highway on the south and Vojislava Ilića on the east. It extends into the neighborhood of Dušanovac on the west and borders Šumice park on the north and Marinkova Bara on the south, across the highway. The area is, like the rest of Konjarnik, characterized by large, rectangular-shaped residential buildings. One of the major centers of Belgrade police, in Ljermontova street, is located in the neighborhood, and so is a new residential-commercial complex of KoŠum and a residential building Testera (Serbian for saw), because of its zig-zag construction. Green, forest belt separates the neighborhood from the highway. = Konjarnik II = Section of Konjarnik east of Vojislava Ilića street, with Ustanička as central street. Apart from many large residential buildings, it has an industrial zone, along the Vojislava Ilića and Mis Irbijeve streets (factories of \\"Precizna mehanika\\", \\"Bukulja\\", \\"Metal\\") and a developing commercial zones along the roundabout of the \\"Lasta\\" bus lines on the crossroads of the Ustanička and Vojislava Ilića streets. Industrial facilities and factories went bankrupt by the 2010s, some were demolished, and the new commercial cluster developed instead. It includes the Vero supermarket Super Vero 2, opened in 2004, and Lidl supermarket, opened in 2018. Also in 2018, construction of the vast shopping mall at the corner of the Vojislava Ilića and Mis Irbijeve began. The mall, with the total floor area of , was opened on 26 June 2020. Named \\"BEO Shopping Center\\" it occupies the lot of the former \\"Precizna Mehanika\\" factory. On the opening, it was the sixth shopping mall in Belgrade, but by the sheer size of the floor area, equaled the \\"Ušće Shopping Center\\" as the largest in the city. = Konjarnik III = Part of Konjarnik north and east of the final section of Ustanička street. It has commercial zones along the roundabout of the bus lines 17, 31 and trolleybus line 19. Two shopping malls, both named \\"Konjarnik\\" (old and new, one across another) are also located in Ustanička. = Učiteljsko Naselje = Učiteljsko Naselje (Учитељско насеље; \\"teachers' settlement\\") is located in the central part of Konjarnik II, centered on the Učiteljska street and the roundabout of the trolleybus line 21, just east of the industrial zone. Also the location of the former Buddhist temple. Residential area, with a population of 9,516 by the 2002 census. and 10,316 in 2011. Učiteljsko naselje is located 3.5 km from Terazije square and just some meters down from Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra street. Elementary school Ćirilo i Metodije is the famous building and the kids from neighbourhood go there in school. Main connection with center is trolleybus line 21. This is a central part of Zvezdara municipality, main street is Učiteljska. Učiteljsko naselje could be proud with many famous people living or lived there, folk- pop-dance singer Ivan Gavrilović, murdered opposition journalist Slavko Ćuruvija, actress Snežana Savić, former FK Partizan player and director Zoran Mirković, cult Serbian criminal Kristijan Golubović as well as others. = Denkova Bašta = Denkova Bašta (Денкова башта; \\"Denko's garden\\") is the latest addition to Konjarnik, ultra-modern city-within-city, built in the late 1990s and early 2000s, along the eastern side of the Vojislava Ilića street. It extends into Cvetkova pijaca on the north. Complex of several residential, step-like arranged circles of buildings. = Rudo = Rudo (Рудо) is a complex of three large buildings, each with 30 floors, over 100 meters in height and, therefore, share between themselves 4th place on list of tallest buildings in Belgrade and also in Serbia. Though officially styled Rudo (after a Bosnian town), the buildings are known as the Eastern Gate of Belgrade. All three buildings are step-like and triangular shaped, built in a circle so it always visually appears that one is between the other two. Buildings, styled Rudo 1, Rudo 2 and Rudo 3, were settled in 1976, but never fully completed, as the facade was not finished.Politika, April 22, 2008, p.23 Since the 1990s, due to the lack of maintenance, buildings were known for elevator and water pumps problems.

General He was the renowned leader of 24 Danish government expeditions to Greenland, and the central character in the Lauge Koch Controversy, an international and intra-national conflict. Beginning in December 1935 a bitter conflict arose between Koch and eleven of the most prominent Danish geologists of the day, including O. B. Bøggild, director of The Mineralogical Museum and professor at the Geological Institute of Copenhagen University, and , head of the Geological Survey of Denmark. Controversy started with a review of the Lauge Koch book Geologie von Grönland (1935) written by ‘the eleven’ and accusing Koch of poor and improper scientific practice. Relating to the years 1921–23 in which Lauge Koch conducted the Bicentenary Jubilee Expedition to North Greenland in the year of the bicentennial jubilee of Hans Egede's landing in Greenland, Koch made a sledge journey along the north coast of Greenland, round Peary Land and back across the Inland Ice. On this journey Koch discovered a depression which in his opinion was the one that Robert Peary in 1892 had mistaken for a channel —the so-called \\"Peary Channel\\". Koch's observations of the interior of Independence Fjord led to considerable cartographic changes compared with the Peter Freuchen map of 1912.The Bi-centennary (sic) Jubilee Expedition 1920-23 at eng.jubie In 1922 he mapped Hiawatha Glacier, and noted that the glacier tongue extended into Lake Alida (near Foulk Fjord). In 1938, Lauge Koch found in the mountains west of Jameson Land, near Scoresby Sound, the skeleton of a huge extinct mammal similar to the head of a gigantic animal with huge teeth found by Professor Selim Hassan in 1935 near the pyramid of Chephren. The skeleton found by Koch was displayed at the museum in Copenhagen. Amongst his other contributions to the sciences, in the mid-1930s Koch established a network of field stations and traveling huts in Central East Greenland. This establishment of a permanent infrastructure in the field caused a change in the whole culture and organization of Danish Arctic exploration. His last expedition would be the 1956-58 Expedition to East Greenland in which he used helicopters. But the Danish government cut funding in mid-expedition and Koch's career as expedition leader was terminated.Matthias Heymann, Henrik Knudsen, Maiken L. Lolck, Henry Nielsen, Kristian H.

The genus is closely related to Miltonia and Brassia. Aspasia species have few medium size flowers of exquisite colors which are occasionally cultivated or used to produce artificial hybrids. Distribution Aspasia exist in four different areas of Central and South America. Some species are exclusively epiphytic on thick stems of the trees a low height, others live on branches where they get more light and a few occasionally appear as lithophytes. Two species inhabit primarily Central America the most common is Aspasia epidendroides, that ranges from Mexico to Colombia from sea level to 1,100 meters of altitude but much more common up to 400 meters; and the other is Aspasia principissa, which exists from Colombia to Costa Rica, from sea level to 600 of altitude but often up to 150 meters. Exclusively from Colombia is Aspasia omissa, that is a species recently described whose full range is not yet determined. Aspasia psittacina, endemic in Ecuador, can be found from sea level to 750 of altitude but is much more common up to 300 meters. Aspasia variegata is common in all Amazonian region,Freitas Luz, Francisco J. (2001). Orquídeas na Amazônia. Instituto Brasileiro de Cultura, Ed. On Line. from 200 to 1300 meters in Bolivia. The last area occupied is the Brazilian southeast and south, reaching Bolivia and Paraguay, from 200 to 750 meters, by Aspasia lunata; and Aspasia silvana exclusively at Brazilian Serra do Mar mountains, from Rio de Janeiro to Bahia. These two, as Miltonia do, form large colonies, however, being not particularly common species, they are just occasionally found, mostly on areas of transition between shady forest and open areas both in rain forests and cloud montane forests.Miller, David; Richard Warren; Izabel Moura Miller & Helmut Seehawer (2006). Aspasia lunata in Serra dos Órgãos sua história e suas orquídeas, 326-7. Rio de Janeiro. Aspasia lunata is primarily epiphyte on thick stems but often is found living over rock grooves covered by fallen leaves and humid forests where they never are exposed to straight sunlight. Aspasia variegata is found in open forests both in dry and flooded lands, then often on branches of the trees hanging over the waters.Miranda, Francisco (2006). Orquídeas da Amazônia Brasileira: 168 & 173 Ed. Expressão e Cultura, 1996.  Description  Aspasia silvana was described in 1989, after being confounded with an intergeneric natural hybrid. Aspasia lunata: this star shaped species is the most common in the Southeast of Brazil. It resembles A. silvana but is much smaller. Aspasia is a genus of comparatively robust plants intermediate of Brassia and Miltonia, to which it is morphologically closer although can be distinguished because its flowers show the labellum partially fused to the column up to the middle then abruptly folded down in a square angle.Hoehne, Frederico C.

They are characterized for often showing am elongated rhizome, with thicker roots than Miltonia, with more elliptical or elongated and highly laterally flattened pseudobulbs, protected by some foliar sheaths shorter than the leaves, and one or two apical leaves. These are articulated, basally conduplicate, ligulate sometimes with acute apex, thin and narrow, very malleable, light green colored. The inflorescence is erect or arching, shorter than the leaves and bares one to nine flowers sometimes showy, which open in quick sequence holding at least three of four opened at the same time. The inflorescence shoots among the foliar sheaths on the pseudobulbs bases. The flowers vary according to the species. The petals from more elliptical to more acute, in some species wider than the sepals, in others narrower or similar in size and shape, from flat to concave. The labellum is fused to the inferior half of the column, seeming to emerge from there and thereafter becoming much wider; the blade varies from slightly to clearly three lobed, flat or reflected, fleshier on the center where they have calli or salient veins. The column is elongated, with or without small inferior auricles and presents a large apical anther with two hard yellow pollinia, stipe and viscidium. Their flowers last for about ten days, however, as not all open at the same time it is common to have a plant blooming during a whole month. Pollination has not been observed and seems to be uncommon for few plants bearing fruits have been seen in nature, however, their floral morphology indicates the possibility of Euglossini bees pollinators. When Aspasia species are used to produce artificial hybrids, the characteristic that seems to predominate is the low number of resulting flowers by inflorescence, prevailing even over the so floriferous Oncidium. Despite being easy to grow Aspasia species tent to be subject to spots on their thin leaves generally caused by fungi proliferation. They should never be exposed to full sunlight. They are not highly sensitive to temperature but as it varies according to their origin, A. lunata being the one that grows cooler and A. principissa the warmer grower all under intermediate or warm temperatures, when possible it is better to try to reproduce the temperature on their habitats. Also for watering it is important to verify the necessities of each species as they come from different environments. Despite they show a resting period after blooming, Aspasia always need to be watered, more abundantly during active growth. They need at least 75% of humidity and good ventilation all the time. Moderate weekly fertilizing with a balanced formula is beneficial during active growth. They may be potted in a compost of half-chopped Sphagnum, vegetable fiber, and some medium-sized lumps of charcoal, or mounted on plaques of vegetable fiber, however, if mounted, they will need more frequent waterings.Baker, Charles O & Baker, Margaret L. (2006). Aspasia in Orchid Species Culture Oncidium/Odontoglossum Alliance: 35–42, Timber Press. Taxonomic notes The genus Aspasia was proposed by John Lindley in 1833 when he described its type species, Aspasia epidendroides. The name of the genus is a reference to Aspasia of Miletus a friend of Pericles. Its original description is very brief and mentions the plant was native in Panama and West Colombia. Three years later he described two species more: Aspasia lunata and A. variegata. Since its first species was described, sixteen names have been submitted to Aspasia, from these, seven are generally accepted as good species, two species remain unclear, six are considered synonyms of the accepted ones, and only one has been moved to another genus: A. pusilla was submitted to the genus Cischweinfia, of which it is the type species.R. Govaerts, M.A. Campacci (Brazil, 2005), D. Holland Baptista (Brazil, 2005), P.Cribb (K, 2003), Alex George (K, 2003), K.Kreuz (2004, Europe), J.Wood (K, 2003, Europe): World Checklist of Orchidaceae. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Published on the Internet. (Access March 2009). Being well defined from the start, Aspasia has hardly been a genus subject to disputes. Its only synonym is the genus Trophianthus, proposed in 1844 by Michael Scheidweiler to Aspasia lunata, because of its slight differences from the other successive flowering species,Scheidweiler, Michael J.F. (1844). Trophianthus zonatus in Allgemeine Gartenzeitung 12: 218. however, this genus was never largely accepted by taxonomists. Provided it was, today it would include also A. silvana. Aspasia lunata was also described again in 1855, by Reichenbach, under the genus Miltonia as M. odorata. Although having initially accepted the genus, Reichenbach decided all Aspasia would be better placed under the genus Odontoglossum and, in 1864, he proposed this transfer.Reichenbach, Henrich G. (1864). Odontoglossum in W.G.Walpers, Ann. Bot. Syst. 6: 851. The idea apparently was not welcome and in 1878 Reichenbach was again accepting Aspasia as a good genus because at the time he transferred Odontoglossum psittacinum,Reichenbach, Henrich G. (1876). Odontoglossum psittacinum in Linnaea 41: 102. a plant re received from Ecuador and described two years earlier, to Aspasia.Reichenbach, Henrich G. (1878). Aspasia psittacina in Gard. Chron. 10(2): 684. Aspasia principissa was described by Reichenbach based on a plant he received from Panama, in 1864,Reichenbach, Henrich G. (1852). Aspasia principissa in Botanische Zeitungung 10(37): 637-638. Berlin. but, in 1949, Paul Hamilton Allen, considering it very close to Aspasia epidendroides, proposed it to be classified just as a variety of the later,Allen, Paul H. (1949). A. epidendroides var. principissa in Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 36(2): 165. Published on the Internet. however his classification was not widely accepted. In 2004, Eric A. Christenson, claiming that a new species of Aspasia from Colombia was long confused with A. principissa described it as A. omissa.Christenson, Eric A. (2004). Aspasia omissa in Richardiana 4: 85. In 1978, Guido Pasbt illustrated a plant in Orchidaceae Brasilienses under the name Milpasia Leslie-Garay.Pabst, Guido & Dungs, Fritz (1978). Orchidaceae Brasilienses 2: 258, Brucke-Verlag Kurt Schmersow, Hildesheim. Later this species was found again in Bahia, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States of Brazil and it became clear it was not a hybrid but a true species, in 1989, Fábio de Barros described with its current name, Aspasia silvana.Barros, Fábio de (1989). Aspasia silvana in Hoehnea 15: 94. Two species, Aspasia lyrata and A. biberiana, have not been seen again since their original collections and are not positively identified.Cogniaux, Celestin A.(1902). Aspasia in Flora Brasiliensis K.F.P.von Martius & auct. suc. (eds.) vol.3 p. 6: 203-7. published on Internet. Both have been described to Brazil. The first, originally described as Epidendrum lyratum, in 1831, was observed by José Maria da Conceição Velloso in Rio de Janeiro.Velloso, José M.C. (1831). Epidendrum lyratum in Florae Fluminensis 9: t. 37. Rio de Janeiro. Published on the Internet. It shows more elongated pseudobulbs of rounder section, and its inflorescence is longer than the leaves with one small flower at the apex. Some taxonomists suppose it might be a natural hybrid, maybe of A. lunata with Miltonia regnellii, or not an Aspasia at all. Provided it really is an Aspasia, then it was the first to be described. The other species, Aspasia biberiana, was described by Reichenbach to Pará State, in Amazon forest; it has solitary green flowers.Reichenbach, Heinrich G. (1854). Aspasia bibriana in Bonplandia 2: 90. Hanover. No known Aspasia from that area fits this description; apparently no taxonomist has checked the original description lately, therefore, more research is needed to positively identify this species. It is possible it was not really from Brazil and is a synonym of A. principissa. Molecular analysis show that Aspasia most closely related important genera are Miltonia and Brassia, which are included in one of the eight clades that form the subtribus Oncidiinae of tribus Cymbidieae.Williams NH, Chase MW, Fulcher T, Whitten WM (2001). Molecular systematics of the Oncidiinae based on evidence from four DNA sequence regions: expanded circumscriptions of Cyrtochilum, Erycina, Otoglossum, and Trichocentrum and a new genus (Orchidaceae) in Lindleyana 16(2): 113-139. Species Aspasia psittacina is the only species that exists in Ecuador. Although it is the largest Aspasia plant, its flowers are not larger than most. The species that exist on the Southeast of Brazil are the only two Aspasia to have a flat labellum. They can be easily separated from each other for A. silvana is a larger plant with longer rhizome and pseudobulbs that have an elongated base making them much taller than the ones of A. lunata. The flowers of A. silvana are three times larger than the ones of A. lunata.Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (2002). Aspasia silvana in Icones Orchidacearum Brasilienses vol 1. Both species, like Miltonia spectabilis to which the slightly resemble, have just one flower, hardly ever two, per inflorescence. Both bloom from middle to the end of spring. All the other Aspasia species bloom in quick succession. Aspasia variegata is similar to A. epidendroides but the plant is much smaller. The pseudobulbs of A. epidendroides are more than two times larger and much flatter, more elliptic, And A. variegata normally shows a flatter labellum with short purple stripes while A. epidendroides has more large stains close to its center. A. variegata blooms between the start of summer and middle fall and presents nice fragrance in the morning. Aspasia epidendroides, A. omissa and A. principissa are similar but the latter is less robust and with larger flowers than A. epidendroides. Other less noticeable differences include: A. epidendroides has broad transverse markings on the lateral sepals, the column with an elliptic depression below the stigma and the apical half of the labellum is porrect while A. principissa has narrow longitudinal stripes on the lateral sepals, the column with a narrow linear groove below the stigma and the apical half of the labellum is not porrect. When Christenson described A. omissa, he claimed this differences were in fact the ones between A. epidendroides and A. omissa and that the real A. principissa is a plant with larger and more green flowers and general paler colors. Aspasia psittacina is the only species found in Ecuador. It is vegetatively close to A. epidendroides, with large elliptic and highly flat pseudobulbs, it shows the same colors of the later, but has narrower flowers with the labellum proportionally much smaller.

Main school building 1918–29, when moved to nearby Fort Pitt Block built as hospital wards used during the Crimean War, now used as classrooms 'Asylum for insane soldiers' 1857 in Fort grounds, now school Music House Fort Pitt Grammar School is a selective girls' grammar school with academy status in Chatham, Kent. Built on Fort Pitt Hill on the site of a Napoleonic era fort, it is situated next to the Rochester campus of the University for the Creative Arts. History :See Fort Pitt, Kent for the history of the Fort. The present Fort Pitt site has served as a school since 1929, when the Chatham Technical Day School for Girls moved there. In 1984 it became a girls’ grammar school, a status it holds to this day. Fort Pitt's history stretches back to the Napoleonic Wars, when a fort was built on the site as part of the defences overlooking the River Medway. Not finally used as a fort, it became a military hospital from 1832. Queen Victoria came to Fort Pitt on three separate occasions in 1855 to visit soldiers wounded in the Crimean War,Howard, pp. 3–11. and in 1860 it was selected by Florence Nightingale as the initial site for the new Army Medical School, before this moved to Netley near Southampton in 1863.A E W Miles, The Accidental Birth of Military Medicine, page 14. Civic Books, London, 2009 . Continuing as a garrison hospital, King George V and Queen Mary visited servicemen wounded in the First World War there in October 1914. The hospital finally closed in 1919. The school began as the Chatham Institute in 1916, to train girls for office work, being based at Elm House, New Road, Chatham from 1918. It became the Junior Commercial School in 1919 and the Commercial and Trades School for Girls in 1923 to reflect a widening curriculum. In 1926 it became the Technical Day School for Girls,Howard, page 20–22. the first girls' technical school in the UK. By 1927 the school, with 270 pupils, had doubled in size since 1919 and accommodation was becoming a problem. In 1929 the Education Board therefore bought Fort Pitt, then empty, from the War Office and the school moved there from Elm House. Here it taught a range of technical and vocational subjects open to girls, including typing and office duties, cooking, needlework and, from 1941, pre-nursing courses.Howard, p. 22. Entrance was by examination, and the courses more advanced than offered by non-selective elementary schools, (and secondary modern schools from 1944). During the Second World War the school remained at Fort Pitt, although numbers were reduced as many children were evacuated. In 1944 it became the Medway Technical School for Girls. The School Certificate (later the General Certificate of Education) was introduced, until then the preserve of the more academic grammar schools.Howard, page 28–30. In 1973 a fire destroyed part of the school, mobile classrooms being installed until new accommodation was built. In 1984 the school was renamed Fort Pitt Grammar School. The site and school continue to be of national historical significance. The Music House in the school grounds and the 'Crimea Wing' are listed buildings, with some of the old hospital ward numbers still visible on the Crimea Wing's walls. It houses a small display of period artefacts, which is open to students and members of the public. Many of the original outer fort walls remain, although part of the old hospital building was destroyed in the 1973 fire.Howard, pp. 30–31. Recently, in 2018, a part of the school's building (often used for science-related work) suffered a chemical leak, making it inaccessible without being harmed. This lead to a new area being built where studies continued as normal. Selective education Today Fort Pitt is one of six selective schools located in the Medway towns. Accredited by the Prince's Trust Teaching Institute, it is a Leading Edge school, a National Support School, and an Initial Teacher Training institution. In its May 2009 report before Fort Pitt left the control of the Medway Council, Ofsted classed Fort Pitt as ‘outstanding’.Ofsted Report: Fort Pitt Grammar School, 2009. Retrieved 20 October 2019. It and its trusts have not been inspected since. It took up academy status in November 2010 and subsequently sponsored two schools as the Fort Pitt Grammar School Academy Trust. In September 2015 the Trust merged with The Thomas Aveling School to form FPTA Academies (Fort Pitt Thomas Aveling Academies). In 2016 the School was nominated as a Champion School for the National Citizen Service programme. School community The school community is divided into 32 ‘vertical’ tutor groups 8 in four 'houses') comprising students from Years 7-13. The school is five form entry in Years 7-11, with a co-educational sixth form with a capacity of 240 students.

Main characters Felix Polon - a foresighted, fair-haired boy with dark brown eyes. He inherited the talent of constructing various things, especially robots, from his father- it saved his friends many times. He can make anything from nothing, always finds a way out of a situation; almost always has a plan. Together with his parents Marlene and Peter, grandmother Lucy, his dog Caban (a Black Russian Terrier) and Golem Golem a robot he built, Felix lives on Serdeczna Street in a small family house. \\\\---- Net Bielecki is quite tall & slim, has blue eyes and a high IQ level. \\"Net\\" is his nickname; his true name is unknown. He is the most trendy and 'awesome' in his entire class. He is a human calculator and is excellent in mathematics. He hates dictations and spelling because he is dyslexic. He is also quite lazy, absent-minded and sometimes hysterical, or panicking. His dark blond hair looks like a heap of hay after a grenade explosion. He is best in ICT and writes many of his own programs. His love interest is Nika Mickiewicz. Together with his parents Lila and Mark, and their newborn twins nicknamed Pompek and Prumcia he lives on the top floor of a Penthouse apartment. \\\\---- Nika Mickiewicz is a girl with a character. She is very brave and mature. She likes reading books. She has curly, red hair, green eyes and a few freckles. She is not very rich; she wears second-hand clothes and her only pair of black Dr. Martens shoes. She lives in a tiny apartment. She is an orphan, but hides that fact from people for almost 3 years. However, Felix and Net, her best and possibly only friends, find out about it. She also has abnormal abilities. She can move distant objects using her powers, ski uphill and knows some things by ituition. In other words, she is telekinetic. \\\\---- Manfred is a friendly AI program started and never finished by Net's father, and mastered and programmed further by Net himself. He likes going on adventures and solving mysteries with the trio much more than his actual job, which is controlling the traffic lights. He helped out the three friends many times and is their reliable and faithful friend. \\\\---- Morten is also an AI program, but he is the antagonist of the trio. He appears in all 6 books of Felix Net and Nika. In the first book, the trio thinks they finished him off for good, but as we find out later, he comes back in the third book. In the fifth/sixth book, he was the mastermind of the Orbital Conspiracy. Also, Morten's logo, appears in all 6 books and it is still a mystery what he has to do with each event.

Release data The album was released as an LP in 1989 by AIP Records (as #AIP-10051) and as a CD in 1997 (as #AIP-CD-1051). Vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks The English Freakbeat LPs and CDs have most tracks in common, although not always in the same order. In most cases, some of the LP tracks were not included on the CDs, although that is not true of this album. Also, the CD bonus tracks are not always at the end of the album. Thus, for clarity, we have shown tracks for both editions of the album, with vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks indicated. Notes on the tracks The following information is taken mostly from the CD liner notes. Thane Russal released a single under his real name, Doug Gibbons for Decca Records in 1965. \\"Security\\" comes from the first of two later singles for CBS Records that were produced by Paul Raven, one of several alter egos for the man who is best known as Gary Glitter; \\"I Need You\\", from the second single, is on English Freakbeat, Volume 5. Cops & Robbers were from Watford and eventually added Doug Stephens, formerly of the Fairies. These two tracks come from an ultra- rare French EP. The Clique is a London band whose \\"She Ain't No Good\\" is from their first of only two singles. \\"We Didn't Kiss\\", from their second single is on the 10th volume in the Rubble series. One of the CD bonus tracks is by the In Crowd (later renamed Tomorrow) and is taken from their first single, before Steve Howe joined the band; Les Jones handles lead guitar on this selection. Their \\"Why Must They Criticise\\" can be found on English Freakbeat, Volume 3; an earlier incarnation of this band as the Four + 1 – not to be confused with Unit 4 + 2 – released \\"Don't Lie to Me\\" that is included on English Freakbeat, Volume 5 (also as a CD bonus track only). \\"Forget It\\" is an early recording by Mal Ryder – this time with the Spirits – and comes from four singles that they released from 1963 to early 1965. Yet another track by his later band, the Primitives is also included; five of their songs can be found on English Freakbeat, Volume 1 (along with additional information on the band in that article). The stage garb of the Snobs was in the style of the 18th century; their debut 1964 single \\"Buckle Shoe Stomp\\" failed to chart in the UK but was a hit in Sweden. \\"Ding Dong\\" was the \\"B\\" side of a fine version of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" that was released only in Sweden; the hit rendition of the song was by the Equals. Little is known about the Sons of Fred, but all of their available recordings that are not included on English Freakbeat, Volume 3 are CD bonus tracks on this album. Tony Dangerfield is backed by a band called the Thrills on this rockabilly-style number that was also recorded by the Honeycombs; both versions were produced by Joe Meek. Dangerfield is rumored to have been a member of the Raving Savages, the backing band for Screaming Lord Sutch (a surf rock recording by this band is on English Freakbeat, Volume 3), as well as Rupert's People who are also featured on that volume in a vinyl-only track. Two other tracks by the Wheels can be found on English Freakbeat, Volume 2, and further information on the band is provided in the article on that album. Mickey Finn and the Blue Men included Jimmy Page, but he did not join the band until a month before \\"Reelin' and Rockin'\\" was issued and may not have participated in its recording. Later music by the band, known as the Mickey Finn or just Mickey Finn is included on English Freakbeat, Volume 2. Shorty & Them is a band from Newcastle that relocated to Germany and released an album there in conjunction with a Liverpool band, the Roadrunners; this long version of \\"Dimples\\" is taken from that LP. Several extremely rare beat singles have surfaced in very limited pressings on the Oak Records label, including this pair from the otherwise unknown 4 Degrees. Stovepipe No. 4 is an unusual name for a band by anyone's standards and is known only from an amazing 3-song EP that they released in Hungary of all places that included a nice treatment of the Bo Diddley classic (the Pretty Things took their name from this song).

Bernoulli sampling is therefore a special case of Poisson sampling. In Poisson sampling each element of the population may have a different probability of being included in the sample. In Bernoulli sampling, the probability is equal for all the elements. Because each element of the population is considered separately for the sample, the sample size is not fixed but rather follows a binomial distribution.

Routledge, . Otrok, known in Georgia as Atraka, son of Sharagan (i.e., Sharukan), after the victories of the Rus' Grand Prince Vladimir II Monomakh in 1109, fled to Georgia with some 40,000 followers, received baptism and entered the service of the Georgian king David IV (c. 1118). The Georgian- Kipchak alliance was facilitated by David's earlier marriage to the khans daughter who received the name Gurandukht (her original Turkic name is unknown). Otrok's Kipchaks helped David against the Seljuk Turks and contributed to the Georgian victory at Didgori in 1121. Otrok's 40,000 Cumans helped make Georgia the most powerful kingdom in the region.Denis Sinor (1990), The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, pp. 181,280. Cambridge University Press, . A passage in the East Slavic chronicle Hypatian Codex relates that after the death of Vladimir Monomakh (1125), an envoy, the bard named Ör, arrived from Otrok's brother Sırchan, who lived near the Don, urging him to return. Ör's urges and songs were without effect until he produced some yawshan, the grass of his native steppe. With this, Otrok tearfully decided to give up the security and fame he had won in \\"a foreign land\\", and returned to the steppe where he fathered Könchek, eventually one of the most famous foes of the princes of Kiev (not to be confused with the 14th-century Chagatai khan Könchek).Gerard Chaliand (2003), Nomadic Empires: From Mongolia to the Danube, p. 52.

In it, teams competed to complete counterclockwise laps around a central barrier while manipulating large diameter \\"Trackballs\\" over and under overpasses to score additional points. Game Overview FIRST Overdrive is played on a by carpeted field, divided lengthwise by a fence median to create a track, and separate the field into Red and Blue zones. The fence is crossed by an overpass marking the red and blue finish lines, and hold the game pieces: diameter inflated balls called \\"Trackballs\\". Two three-team alliances race around the track in a counter clockwise direction while manipulating the trackballs to score points. The game is made up of two scoring periods. The first 15 seconds of play is the Hybrid period in which robots are autonomous, and may also respond to certain digital signals sent by team members designated as \\"Robocoaches\\", who are stationed at the corners of the track. The next two minutes of play is the Teleoperated period. At this time, robots are fully radio controlled by the team operators standing at either end of the field. = Scoring = During the Hybrid period, robots traveling in a counter clockwise direction score: *8 points for each of their Trackballs knocked off of the overpass *8 points for each of their Trackballs passed over the overpass *4 points whenever their robot crosses a lane marker *4 points whenever their robot crosses their opponent's finish line *4 points whenever their robot crosses their finish line *2 points whenever their trackball crosses their finish line During the Teleoperated period, robots traveling in a counter clockwise direction score: *2 points whenever their robot crosses their finish line *2 points whenever their Trackball crosses their finish line *8 points whenever their Trackball hurdles their overpass Alliances score an additional 12 points for each of their Trackballs that are positioned anywhere on the overpass at the end of the match. = Hybrid period = Hybrid period is a new addition to an FRC game. Rather than the pre-game autonomous modes of previous years where robots were prohibited from receiving input from humans, robots may receive signals via an infrared (IR) remote control or visible light from a designated Robocoach during the Hybrid period. The number of different IR signals the IR board included in the kit of parts is physically able to receive is 4. The number of distinct commands that are allowed to be sent is also 4, thus ruling out multi-signal combinations.

The prototype was constructed and flown in New Zealand, with production aircraft built in the United States at Harlingen, Texas. Development The prototype Murrayair MA-1 was built by Air New Zealand on behalf of Murrayair Limited of Hawaii, United States. Based on the Stearman 75 Kaydet, it had an increased wing area and modification to the forward fuselage to accommodate a pilot (in a raised cockpit for better visibility), a jump seat (used to carry an assistant or mechanic between stations), and a chemical hopper. The fixed tailwheel landing gear was strengthened and a more powerful Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine fitted. It first flew in New Zealand on 27 July 1969, then it was dismantled and shipped to Hawaii to obtain United States type certification; certification was awarded on 14 April 1970.J W R Taylor 1971, p.360. Production and development Emair began production of the aircraft at Harlingen in Texas. The production aircraft were named Agronemair MA-1 Paymaster at first, then designated the Emair MA-1 Paymaster. Production ended in 1976 after 25 had been built.J W R Taylor 1980,p.333. In 1975 Emair developed an improved version, the Emair MA-1B Diablo 1200, which was essentially an MA-1 with a more powerful Wright R-1820 radial engine. The more powerful engine did not increase the maximum takeoff weight but allowed operations at higher altitudes, and its lower output speed helped reduce propeller noise. Forty-eight MA-1s had been built by early 1980, with production being suspended by the end of the year due to poor market conditions. At the end of the 1980s the company halted production after a further 23 Diablos had been built.Simpson 1991, page 349 Variants ;Murrayair MA-1 :New Zealand-built prototype with a 600hp (447kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN1 Wasp radial engine. ;Emair MA-1 Paymaster :Production aircraft, 25 built. ;Emair MA-1B Diablo 1200 :Improved version with a 900hp (671 kW) de-rated Wright R-1820 radial engine, 48 built.

Little is known of it as few records remain, but a single copy survives in the Library of Birmingham: Number 28, dated Monday May 21, 1733. It is assumed from this that the first edition was probably published on 14 November 1732. Background The newspaper was published weekly (on Thursday) by local businessman and bookseller Thomas Warren from his house over the Swan Tavern in the High Street. p. 134 Among its contributors was Samuel Johnson, whose work for the Journal while he was lodging with Warren in Birmingham in 1733 was his first original published writing. James Boswell wrote of this in his Life of Johnson: Publication of the Birmingham Journal is known to have ceased by 1741. Johnson's role There is no physical record that documents to what extent Johnson played a part in the making of the Journal. It is known that Johnson was asked by Warren to work on the paper, and that Warren respected the extent of Johnson's knowledge to the point that he wanted to harness it for the Journal. There was an old tradition among the Birmingham bookselling community that Johnson was an \\"assistant\\" to Warren and that Johnson wrote several of the essays that were printed in the paper. However, this cannot be verified because none of the papers printed during the months that Johnson could have worked on the Journal have survived.

It is located in the Somerset County Public Schools district and handles five grades: 8th and 9th grade are handled in an \\"academy\\" section of the school, while grades 10 through 12 are handled as high school. The school is on North Somerset Avenue, between the intersections of Potomac Street and Mercury Lane, and is close to Maryland Route 413. It has the distinction of being the southernmost high school in the state of Maryland. Crisfield High School was established in 1908 as the first public school in lower Somerset County, succeeding the old Crisfield Academy. It has moved numerous times since then, going through expansions, several arsons, and desegregation of schools through its lifetime. For the past fifty years, the county school system has been attempting to consolidate schools, but this has been largely resisted, even though the enrollment for the school has been steadily decreasing over the years.Maryland State Department of Education The school has sports teams for basketball, baseball, softball, field hockey, soccer, and indoor/outdoor track & field. Its high school band, which participates in concerts and parades, is affectionately known as the Pride of Somerset. Also, in the 2003-2004 school year, an AJROTC was added to the school's various extracurricular activities. History Prior to 1908, there was only one educational facility in Crisfield: the original Crisfield Academy, located on Asbury Avenue near the intersection with Somerset Avenue. In 1908, the very first Crisfield High School was built, succeeding the Academy. This school, however, only served the white population of Crisfield. This building was closed in 1926 when a new, larger building was constructed, on Somerset Avenue. A school had also been built shortly before World War II for the African-American population, named Crisfield Colored High School, which succeeded limited facilities for those students whom beforehand were only equipped for teaching up to sixth grade. This building was located on Collins Street, near the current site of Family Dollar. This building was succeeded by Woodson High School on South Somerset Avenue. A third high school building opened in 1953 at the site of the current high school, with two high school buildings operating in Crisfield on Somerset Avenue at this time. By the 1969-1970 school year, desegregation of high school had taken place, and Woodson High School had been renovated into the area middle school as the high school students were moved to CHS. In 1972, the high school building built in 1926 was destroyed in an arson fire. After the fire, a new building was constructed on the property of the 1953 building. This is the building currently located at 210 North Somerset Avenue and in current operation, though it has gone through expansions and renovations since then. The Somerset County Public School System has been attempting since the 1960s to consolidate Crisfield High with Washington High School, which serves northern Somerset County, as the dwindling population of Somerset County has caused school enrollment to shrink as well. The schools have largely resisted this, though the middle school was closed at the end of the 2003-2004 school year, and after an extensive renovation reopened for the 2004-2005 school year as Carter G. Woodson Elementary School in September 2004. Somerset Intermediate School, located in Westover for 6th and 7th graders of Somerset County, was built during the spring and summer of 2004, and opened for students in September 2004. Crisfield High School's name was changed to Crisfield Academy and High School, and also took on the 8th grade students in lower Somerset County beginning with the 2004-2005 school year. Students Crisfield's graduation rate has been steadily declining over the past 12 years. In 2007, the school graduated 63.5% of its seniors, down from a high of 86.7% in 2002.Maryland Report Card Crisfield is a fairly small high school. In 2007, the school showed its largest enrollment over the previous 12 years. Extracurricular activities Crisfield Academy and High School hosts several different sports, most noticeably basketball (known as the Crisfield Crabbers), which wins the school most of its sports championships.MPSSAA Boys Basketball The school also has a soccer,MPSSAA Boys' Soccer and field hockey team. CHS also has a high school band, which is affectionately known as the \\"Pride of Somerset\\" as it was once the largest organization of any sort in the county; however, this is no longer the case, as even the Washington High School band is larger at present. The school also has an AJROTC, implemented during the 2003-2004 school year.

Maynes of North Tonawanda, New York who dubbed it the Caterpillar when it debuted in Coney Island, NY in 1925. It generates a significant amount of centrifugal force, causing the riders on the inside of the seats to crush the riders on the outside of the seats. It was once found at nearly every amusement park around the USA, but is now so rare that an original Caterpillar ride can only be found operating in two parks today. Though only two Caterpillars are known to be operating, there have been reports claiming there are additional Caterpillars in storage or standing (but not operating) at a few other parks. The ride features a complete circuit of motorized vehicles which are connected end-to-end all the way around the ride, in a manner similar to a Music Express. Also, the cars travel a circular, undulating (wave-like) track very similar to that of a Tumble Bug. This ride is famous for its usually green canopy (one previously located at Geauga Lake had a yellow and black canopy) that automatically, or manually in the case of Heritage Park's, begins to slowly surround the cars and fully encapsulate them once the ride reaches its maximum velocity, though DelGrosso's indoor version called Space Odyssey operated without it. When covered with the canopy, the ride tends to look like a caterpillar, which is probably how Mr. Maynes got the name for his ride. A high powered fan located at one point under the carriage of the ride, was traditionally used to surprise riders with a blast of air as the cars go around the track. The Caterpillar most likely served as Moser Rides' inspiration for the popular Music Express (sometimes Musik Express or Himalaya) style ride. The Amor Express is a caterpillar / Musik Express hybrid variant made by SDC. Dubbed \\"The Love Machine\\", it has the appearance of a typical Music Express, but features a manually operated canopy that is striped similar in fashion to the traditional caterpillar. Manufacturers Caterpillar rides were manufactured by several old amusement ride companies including: * Traver Engineering (famous for inventing the Tumble Bug) * Allan Herschell * Spillman Engineering Maynes, the inventor of the Caterpillar and owner of the patent, was paid a royalty by the companies that built the ride, or sometimes the buyer of the ride. Locations The only two original Caterpillars still known to be operating are at: * Canobie Lake Park in Salem, NH (operated with original canopy) * Heritage Park Historical Village in Calgary, AB (operating with original canopy) Original Caterpillar rides either in storage or in collections (may be occasionally operating) are at: * Idlewild and Soak Zone in Ligonier, Pennsylvania (with original canopy and undercarriage fan) * Dreamland Margate (previously operated at Pleasureland Southport until 2006) * Scarborough Fair Collection, dating from 1928 * Folly Farm, Pembrokeshire, Wales A 1950s Toboggan ride was converted to a Caterpillar with operating canopy in 1955.Folly Farm Pembrokeshire, A look at the past * Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, PA originally a Caterpillar ride at West View Park, Pittsburgh, PA.

The ride was purchased in the 1980s from the nearby Lakemont Park, which was having financial issues at the time. The ride was moved to Delgrosso's and enclosed with many special effects like a spinning disco ball that lowered from the ceiling, an alarm that when off at the start of the ride cycle, and blacklight neon posters. The ride did not have the mechanical closing canopy, but the special effects made up for it.

Vinzons at Daet, Camarines Norte Wenceslao “Bintao” Quinito Vinzons (born Wenceslao Quinito Vinson, September 28, 1910 – July 15, 1942) was a Filipino politician and a leader of the armed resistance against the Japanese occupying forces during World War II. He was the youngest member of the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Among the first Filipinos to organize the guerrilla resistance after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, he was executed by the Japanese Army. For leading demonstrations as a student leader, he was dubbed the \\"Father of Student Activism in the Philippines\\". Early life and education Vinzons was born in the town of Indan, Camarines Norte to Gabino Vinzons y Venida and Engracia Quinito y Elep. He was the grandson by paternal line of Serafín Vinzons, who was Chinese, and of Baldomera Venida, and by maternal line of Rosalío Quinito and Cipriana Elep He was baptized on October 5, 1910 by Marciano Bamba at Saint Peter the Apostle Church in the same town, and his godfather was Ángel Anz. He graduated valedictorian from his local high school, and proceeded to study at the University of the Philippines in Manila. While at the university, Vinzons gained fame as a student leader. A member of Upsilon Sigma Phi, Vinzons would be elected president of the student council and editor-in-chief of the Philippine Collegian. He was also known for delivering an oratorical address entitled Malaysia Irredenta, where he advocated the unification of Southeast Asian nations with a common Malay origin. The piece won him the Manuel L. Quezon gold medal for excellence. Vinzons obtained his law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law in 1932, and placed 3rd in the bar examinations the following year. Political career After graduation, Vinzons, along with Narciso J. Alegre and Arturo M. Tolentino (a future senator and Marcos-era vice-president) founded a political party, the Young Philippines Party, which advocated the grant of Philippine independence from American rule. After the passage in 1934 of the Tydings–McDuffie Act which laid the groundwork for independence, Vinzons successfully sought election that same year as a delegate together with Baldomero M. Lapak representing Camarines Norte to the 1935 Constitutional Convention tasked with drafting a new constitution. As a member of the Convention, he was instrumental in prescribing Tagalog as an official language of the Philippines. At 24, he was the youngest delegate, and the youngest signer of the 1935 Constitution. During the 1935 presidential elections, Vinzons actively campaigned for the presidential bid of former president Emilio Aguinaldo, the main challenger to then-Senate President Manuel Quezon. Vinzons' efforts helped Aguinaldo carry Camarines even though Quezon won the presidency. Following Aguinaldo's defeat, Vinzons put on hold his political career, opting instead to become the president of a mining corporation based in his home province. Vinzons resumed political life in 1940, when he was elected governor of Camarines Norte. The following year, he successfully ran for election to the National Assembly, representing the lone district of Camarines Norte. His service in the legislature was interrupted by the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. Guerrilla activities and execution Within days following the arrival of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, Vinzons began to organize armed resistance in the Bicol region against the invasion army, which had arrived in the region on December 12, 1941. He commandeered all the rice warehouses in Camarines Norte, and ordered the confiscation of explosives used in the province's gold mines for use against the Japanese army. By December 18, 1941, he would lead a raid against a troop of Japanese soldiers in Basud, Camarines Norte. His guerrilla forces soon grew to around 2,800 strong, and in May 1942, Vinzons would lead these forces to successfully liberate the provincial capital of Daet. It is said that between December 1941 and May 1942, Vinzon's troops, armed with poisoned arrows among other weapons, were able to kill around 3,000 Japanese soldiers. As a result, the capture of Vinzons became a prime objective of the Japanese army. With the help of a traitor who was a former guerrilla-turned-informant, Vinzons was seized by the Japanese military together with his father on July 8, 1942. He refused to pledge allegiance to his captors, and was brought to a garrison in Daet. It was there, on July 15, 1942, that Vinzons was bayoneted to death after refusing one final entreaty to cooperate with the Japanese forces. Shortly thereafter, his father, wife, sister and two of his children were also executed by the Japanese. Tributes Vinzons Hall, at the University of the Philippines, Diliman Vinzons is hailed as the \\"Father of Student Activism in the Philippines\\". Vinzons' hometown of Indan was renamed Vinzons, in his memory, as was an elementary school in Manila. The student activity center of the University of the Philippines campus in Diliman was named Vinzons Hall in 1959. Vinzons Hall also houses the offices of the Philippine Collegian. Senator Richard Gordon, an admirer of Vinzons and former UP Student Council Chairman commissioned sculptor Sajid Imao for a bust in his honor at Vinzons Hall as part of rehabilitation efforts by the UP Student Council in 2009. Several of Vinzons' relatives embarked on political careers. Fernando Vinzons Pajarillo was related to Wenceslao and had been elected congressman and governor, for many terms. Wenceslao's son was a one-time governor. His daughter Rannie Vinzons-Gaite was once member of the Provincial Council. The current lone legislative district of Camarines Norte is currently served by a descendant, former BIR Commissioner and now Representative Liwayway Vinzons- Chato. A three-act musical on Vinzon's life, entitled \\"Bintao\\", was staged at the University of the Cordilleras in January 2008. For its centennial anniversary in November 2018, the Upsilon Sigma Phi also staged \\"Bintao\\" under the direction of Tony Mabesa and Alexander Cortez.

Named in honour of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, The park's features include two linked ponds with a fountain and waterfalls, the Théâtre de Verdure open-air venue, the Calixa-Lavallée cultural centre, a monument to Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, playing fields and tennis courts. Its ponds are a popular attraction during Montreal's hot summers, with outdoor ice skating in winter. Bike paths run along the park’s western and northern edges. Parc Lafontaine is surrounded by Sherbrooke Street on the South, Parc-La Fontaine Avenue on the West, Rachel Street on the North, and Papineau avenue on the East. History An aerial view of La Fontaine Park in 1947. La Fontaine Park (formerly Logan Park) is located on the grounds of the old Logan farm. This land was sold in 1845 to the Government of Canada, which then used it for military practice until 1888. The soldiers of the British garrison housed there and were trained in the surrounding wilderness. The City of Montreal rented part of the Logan farm to create a park that was inaugurated in 1874 under the name \\"Logan Park\\". In 1888, the park underwent its first major landscaping work. It was part of the first phase of the development of the city's large nature parks, which also included Mount Royal and St. Helen's Island. Two years later, the greenhouses from Viger Square were moved to the park. This is where all the flowers that adorn the city were grown, until 1952. In 1900, the city dug two basins at different levels, in the center of the park. They were separated by a waterfall over which the French landscape architect Clovis Degrelle built a bridge. Occupying increasing importance to the Francophone population, Logan Park was renamed La Fontaine Park, in 1901, at the time of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade. The park was named not for its famous fountain, but instead to honor the memory of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, the first francophone prime minister of the Province of Canada. Crowds at Lafontaine Park, 1938Three years later, the city expropriated homes on the city block and in the park. In 1909, the federal government donated almost all of the western section. The illuminated fountain, which was designed by Léon Trépanier and commissioned by the Westinghouse Electric Company, was erected in the north basin in 1929. At the same time, the monument in honor of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine was installed. A few years later, under the direction of Claude Robillard, the director of the Municipal Parks Service, La Fontaine Park was completely redesigned. This also marked the beginning of the construction of the chalet restaurant according to the plans by architect Donat Beaupré (the previous chalet had been destroyed by fire in 1944). The new building is part of an overall plan which includes a central pavilion, a conch for symphony concerts, an amphitheater with a capacity of 4,000 seats, a new bridge and a modification of the two ponds. The greenhouses, caretaker's house, the waterfall and the Grenelle-built bridge were demolished. In 1953 the chalet restaurant was opened by the Mayor of Montreal, Camillien Houde. The Théâtre de Verdure was inaugurated on 8 July 1956. This was also built by Claude Robillard, and was intended to host outdoor theatrical performances inspired by ancient amphitheatres. In 1965, under the direction of Germaine Dugas, the theatre produced many singers, including among others, Clémence DesRochers, Raymond Lévesque, Pauline Julien and Yvon Deschamps. For over 50 years, the outdoor theatre offered, free cultural programming in a natural setting. La Fontaine Park in the summer For many years the park also hosted the \\"Garden of Wonders\\" (), a small urban zoo built by the city, which opened on July 5, 1957. The garden closed in 1989. Its buildings were inspired by fables and tales, it had farm animals and other more exotic animals, including its sea lions. Beautification works were initiated in the park in 1990: a new pathway leads visitors to a lookout above the upper pool, while a second lookout, where the works of Michel Goulet can be observed, dominates the lower pond in the axis of Roy Street. The statues of Charles de Gaulle and Félix Leclerc were installed. In 1992, the park came under full legal ownership of the City of Montreal. The park is occupied by many buildings such as the École supérieure du Plateau and Calixa Lavallée pavilion. Over the years, many monuments were added, such as the one dedicated to Adam Dollard des Ormeaux (1920) . Today, La Fontaine Park continues to host the Théâtre de Verdure and the Espace La Fontaine cultural café.

It took its name from Hubert, a mediaeval benefactor. Its parish records are among the most detailed in the United Kingdom,Parish records analysed and have been extensively researched. The church was repaired and \\"richly beautified\\" in 1630, at a cost to the parishioners of more than £600. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt. Instead the parish was united with that of St Mary-at-Hill and the site sold to the city authorities. Part of the land was used to widen the roadway, and the rest to build the Royal Weigh House. A parish vestry was built at the east end of the weighhouse, beneath which were \\"a Portico, Publick Stocks, a Cage, and a Little Room\\". A Parish boundary mark can be found in nearby Philpot Lane.

It is a highly conserved, non-histone protein part of the heterochromatin family. The protein itself is more commonly called (in humans) HP1α. Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) has an N-terminal domain that acts on methylated lysines residues leading to epigenetic repression. The C-terminal of this protein has a chromo shadow-domain (CSD) that is responsible for homodimerizing, as well as interacting with a variety of chromatin-associated, non-histone proteins.  Structure  HP1α is 191 amino acids in length containing 6 exons. As mentioned above, this protein contains two domains, an N-terminal chromodomain (CD) and a C- terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD). The CD binds with histone 3 through a methylated lysine residue at position 9 (H3K9) while the C-terminal CSD homodimerizes and interacts with a variety of other chromatin-associated, non-histone related proteins. Connecting these two domains is the hinge region. = Chromodomain = Once translated, the chromodomain will take on a globular conformation consisting of three β-sheets and one α-helix. The β-sheets are packed up against the helix at the carboxy terminal segment. The charges on the β sheets are negative thus making it difficult for it to bind to the DNA as a DNA-binding motif. Instead, HP1α binds to the histones as a protein interaction motif. Specific binding to CD to the methylated H3K9 is mediated by three hydrophobic side chains called the \\"hydrophobic box\\". Other sites on HP1 will interact with the H3 tails from neighbouring histones which will give structure to the flexible N-terminal tail of the histones. Neighbouring H3 histones can affect HP1 binding by post- translationally modifying the tails. = Chromoshadow domain = The CSD much resembles that of the CD. It too has a globular conformation containing three β-sheets, however it possesses two α-helices as opposed to just the one in the CD. The CSD readily homodimerizes in vitro and as a result forms a groove which can accommodate HP1 associated proteins that have a specific consensus sequence: PxVxL, where P is Proline, V is Valine, L is Leucine and x is any amino acid.  Mechanism of action  HP1α primarily functions as a gene silencer, which is dependent on the interactions between the CD and the methyl H3K9 mark. The hydrophobic box on the CD provides the appropriate environment for the methylated lysine residue. While the exact mechanism of how gene silencing is done is unknown, experimental data concluded the rapid exchange of biological macromolecules in and out of the heterochromatin region. This suggests HP1 isn't acting as a glue holding the heterochromatin together, but rather there are competing molecules within that interact in various ways to create a closed complex leading to gene repression or an open, euchromatin structure with gene activation. HP1 concentration is higher and more static in areas of the chromosome where methylated H3K9 residues reside, giving the chromosome its closed, gene-repressed heterochromatin structure. It has also been shown that the more methylated the H3 lysine is, the higher the affinity HP1 has for it. That is, trimethylated lysine residues bind tighter to HP1 than dimethylated residues, which bind better than monomethylated residues. The localisation driving factor is currently unknown.  Evolutionary conservation  HP1α is a highly evolutionary conserved protein, existing in species such a Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a type of yeast, all the way to humans. The N-terminal chromodomain and C-terminal chromoshadow domain appear to be much more conserved (approximately 50-70% amino acid similarity) than the hinge region (approximately 25-30% similarity with the Drosophila HP1 homolog).

Schwaben was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was laid down in 1900, and completed in April 1904. Her sister ships were , , and ; they were the first capital ships built under the Navy Law of 1898, championed by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. Schwaben was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Schwaben spent most of her career as a gunnery training ship from 1904 to 1914, though she frequently participated in the large scale fleet exercises during this period. After the start of World War I in August 1914, the ship was mobilized with her sisters as IV Battle Squadron. She saw limited duty in the North Sea as a guard ship and in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces. The threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw from the Baltic in 1916. For the remainder of the war, Schwaben served as an engineering training ship for navy cadets. She was retained by the Reichsmarine after the war and reactivated from 1919 until June 1920, serving as a depot ship for F-type minesweepers in the Baltic. The ship was stricken from the navy list in March 1921 and sold for scrapping in that year.  Description  Line-drawing of the Wittelsbach class After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first Naval Law in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The Wittelsbachs were broadly similar to the Kaiser Friedrichs, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout. Schwaben was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six water-tube and six cylindrical coal-fired boilers. Schwabens powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men. Schwabens armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 and twelve 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. The armament system was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four were on the broadside. Her armored belt was thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces, and the deck was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.  Service history  Schwabens keel was laid 15 September 1900, at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 27. She was ordered under the contract name \\"G\\", as a new unit for the fleet. Schwaben was launched on 19 August 1901; during the launching ceremony, King Wilhelm II of Württemberg gave a speech and his wife Queen Charlotte of Württemberg christened the ship. She was commissioned on 13 April 1904, the last ship of her class to enter active service. The ship's cost totaled 21,678,000 marks There was a dispute over where Schwaben should be assigned after her commissioning in April 1904. Admiral Hans von Koester, the fleet commander, wanted the ship to be assigned to the active duty squadron, but Tirpitz wanted to use the new battleship as a training vessel, since the Training Squadron only possessed cruisers and obsolescent ships. Tirpitz won the debate, and so Schwaben was to replace the ancient ironclad frigate in the Training Squadron. There, she was to serve as a torpedo training ship. On 18 May, Schwaben departed Wilhelmshaven and passed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic Sea, arriving in Kiel on 22 May. While on sea trials, she struck an uncharted shoal off the northern tip of the island of Fehmarn. The impact damaged a length of the ship's hull and holed it in several places. After repairs were completed, she resumed her trials, which lasted until the end of 1904. The trials were interrupted by the annual autumn maneuvers, during which Schwaben joined the active fleet in the North Sea. On 11 January 1905, she was formally assigned to the Training Squadron, but as an artillery training ship to replace the old vessel . The ship was based in Sonderburg in the Baltic, along with the armored cruisers and , and several other training ships. She began an annual routine of gunnery training in the western Baltic that was interrupted only by yearly gunnery drills with the entire High Seas Fleet in October. During these fleet exercises, Schwaben was supported by the tender . Schwaben also went into drydock from the end of October to the middle of December every year for periodic maintenance. Schwaben participated in exercises in the Swinemünde Bay in April and May 1906, and the annual fleet gunnery drills took place off Helgoland in August. Her annual overhaul was completed early, in November. In March 1907, Schwaben participated in gunnery training with the fleet. She joined the flagship of the Reserve Squadron, the coastal defense ship , for maneuvers off the coast of Farther Pomerania in July. The following month, Schwaben served as the flagship of VAdm Hugo Zeye for a training squadron during the fleet maneuvers in the North Sea. Directly after the conclusion of the fleet maneuvers in mid-September, Schwaben participated in fleet gunnery drills off Helgoland. The year was concluded with an overhaul in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. In 1908, the training ships based in the Baltic were placed under the command of Rear Admiral Hugo von Pohl, who would go on to command the High Seas Fleet in 1915 during World War I. That year followed the same pattern as the previous year, but Schwaben did not participate in the autumn fleet maneuvers. She instead remained at Sonderburg and Alsen during the exercises. In 1909, after the autumn maneuvers, Schwaben was assigned as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet, again under the command of Admiral Zeye. During her yearly overhaul at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, her guns were fitted with new motors produced in Germany to test their reliability over foreign-manufactured motors. The tests proved to be successful. While steaming in the Flensburg Firth on 10–12 December, she had to assist the training ship in heavy fog. In 1910, after the normal training routine in the first half of the year, Schwaben was assigned to III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 19 August to 11 September. She served in this role to replace the battleships and , which had been sold to the Ottoman Empire just before the start of the maneuvers. On 14 October, she joined up with the battleship and steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to Kiel for her yearly overhaul at the Imperial Dockyard there. These repairs lasted until 4 January 1911. Schwaben served in III Battle Squadron during the autumn maneuvers again in 1911. By 1911, the eight and es of dreadnought battleships had entered service; these ships were assigned to I Battle Squadron, which displaced the newer pre-dreadnoughts of the and es to II and III Battle Squadrons. As a result, Schwaben was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 30 December 1911 and assigned to the Reserve Division in the North Sea. She was placed back in service briefly from 9 to 12 May 1912 to move to Kiel. Schwaben returned to service again to participate in the autumn maneuvers from 14 August to 28 September, as the flagship of then-KAdm Maximilian von Spee. = World War I = Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Schwaben and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the German Bight—usually stationed in the mouth of the Elbe—and for operations in the Baltic. Starting on 3 September, IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Schwaben, was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. Schwaben and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, KAdm Alberts. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau. Schwaben and the other ships stood off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings, which the Russians did not attempt. On 10 May, after the invasion force had entered Libau, the British submarines and spotted IV Squadron, but were too far away to make an attack. The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships. As a result, Schwaben and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that assaulted the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, due to the scarcity of escorts. On 29 August, Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Walter Engelhardt replaced Alberts aboard Schwaben. She was then used as a guard ship in Libau, starting on 24 September. On 10–11 November, Schwaben, her sisters and , and Prinz Heinrich left Libau, bound for Kiel. By late 1915, the increasing threat from British submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships from active service. On 20 November Schwaben steamed to Wilhelmshaven, where she replaced as a training ship for engineers, a role she held for the remainder of the war. After the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June, in which Schwaben did not take part, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of the German battlecruiser squadron, sent his four surviving battlecruisers to dock for repairs. Hipper made Schwaben, which was stationed in Wilhelmshaven, his temporary command ship while his force was being repaired. In 1916, Schwaben was partially disarmed; the four 24 cm guns were removed, her battery of 15 cm guns was reduced to six weapons, and only four 8.8 cm guns were left aboard. = Postwar service = The ship was briefly retained by the Reichsmarine after the war, and was reactivated for service on 1 August 1919. According to Articles 182 and 193 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was obliged to keep sufficient vessels in commission to sweep mines from large areas in the North and Baltic Seas. Schwaben was therefore converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers to assist in meeting Germany's treaty obligations, which entailed removal of her remaining weaponry and construction of platforms to hold the minesweepers. She was assigned to the 6th Baltic Minesweeping Half-Flotilla, though this service did not last long, as the minesweeping work was completed by 19 June 1920. The old battleship was stricken from the naval register on 8 March 1921. She was sold for 3,090,000 marks and broken up for scrap that year in Kiel-Nordmole.

History El Sol was founded in 1982 in Queens, New York, by Arnulfo Arteaga, a native of Colombia, originally with a circulation of only 300 copies, which he distributed from a shopping cart he found in a Dumpster. Arteaga already had 20 years of experience in journalism before he immigrated to the United States in 1980. In New York City, he freelanced for El Diario and La Prensa, but couldn't get a permanent job with either because he didn't speak English well enough. The newspaper began circulating in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in 1995, and in 2002 moved its news operation to Stamford. At that time, circulation was at 10,000 copies. By 1997, the paper increased its frequency, becoming a weekly, and in 2001 it launched its Web site. In September 2007, the newspaper celebrated its 25th anniversary with a gala at the Italian Center of Stamford. By October of that year, Arteaga, then 65, had recently retired as director of the newspaper.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 Organizational changes The archdiocese of Conza existed from the eighth century to 1986, latterly as the archdiocese of Conza-Campagna (from 1818 to 1921) and the archdiocese of Conza-Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Bisaccia (from 1921 to 1986). After 1986 it became part of the archdiocese of Sant’Angelo dei Lombardi-Conza-Nusco-Bisaccia. The current archdiocese therefore has incorporated, with Conza, the diocese of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi-Bisaccia and the diocese of Nusco. History Conza, a city of the province of Avellino, Southern Italy, was twice destroyed by earthquakes (980, 1694), and was at one time nearly abandoned. The first known Bishop of Conza is Pelagius, who was present at the Roman synod of 743 held under Pope Zachary. The see was raised to the rank of an archbishopric under Pope Alexander II or Pope Gregory VII (i.e. between 1061 and 1085), having previously been a suffragan of the archdiocese of Salerno. Among the bishops was the Blessed Erberto (1169). The bishops resided either in their feudal stronghold of Santomenna, at Campagna, or at Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi, the later episcopal residence. The diocese of Campagna was erected by Clement VII, 19 June 1525; the see was vacant from 1793 to 1818, when it was placed under Conza. It became independent of Conza in 1921, and was united to the archdiocese of Salerno-Conza-Acerno in 1986.Catholic Hierarchy page Ordinaries=Diocese of Conza= Erected: 8th Century Latin Name: Compsana =Archdiocese of Conza= Elevated: 11th Century Latin Name: Compsana *Gaspard de Diano (20 May 1422 – 21 Feb 1438 Appointed, Archbishop of Naples) *Latino Orsini (10 Mar 1438 – 8 Jun 1439 Confirmed, Archbishop of Trani) *Raimondo degli Ugotti, O.S.B.

The pontifical vestments are only worn when celebrating or presiding over liturgical functions. As such, the garments should not be confused with choir dress, which are worn when attending liturgical functions but not celebrating or presiding. Western Christianity Archbishop José Palma vested in liturgical vestments: The mitre, pallium, Roman chasuble, pontifical dalmatic, episcopal gloves and ring, and the crozier Bishop Baxant in liturgical vestments Pontifical tunicle Pontifical sandals The pontifical accoutrements include the: *mitre *pectoral cross *ecclesiastical ring *chasuble *pontifical dalmatic *crosier (carried) *zucchetto A metropolitan archbishop also wears a pallium within his own ecclesiastical province, once he has received it from the Pope. After receiving it, he is entitled to have an archiepiscopal cross (with two cross- bars instead of one) carried before him.Caeremoniale Episcoporum, 62 and 79 Today bishops rarely use the following accoutrements, unless celebrating Solemn Pontifical Mass in its pre-1970 form: *liturgical stockings (also known as buskins) *episcopal sandals *episcopal gloves *bugia – Italian for \\"candle\\", especially used (in various languages) to refer to an additional candle carried by a server standing beside a bishop at some Christian (particularly Roman Catholic) liturgical celebrations. These items are no longer even mentioned in the Caeremoniale Episcoporum, which has also omitted the description that earlier editions gave of the accoutrements of the bishop's horse. When celebrating Mass, the bishop wears alb, stole and chasuble, in the manner done by priests. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations he should also wear a dalmatic, which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of holy orders, blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.Caeremoniale Episcoporum, 56 A tunicle was also worn until the apostolic letter Ministeria quaedam of 15 August 1972 decreed that, with effect from 1 January 1973, the functions that in the Latin Church had been assigned to the subdeacon should thenceforth be carried out by the instituted ministers (not members of the clergy) known as lectors and acolytes. When attending solemnly (often referred to as \\"presiding\\") at Solemn Pontifical Mass celebrated by another bishop, when presiding at Solemn Pontifical Vespers, and when celebrating the sacraments of baptism, marriage, and confirmation outside Mass, a bishop may wear a cope. A cope may be worn also by priests or deacons for liturgical celebrations outside Mass. At any liturgical celebration, whether wearing chasuble (for Mass) or cope, the bishop may also wear a mitre, pectoral cross, ecclesiastical ring and zucchetto. He may also carry the crosier if the celebration is within his own diocese or if he is celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local bishop.Caeremoniale Episcoporum, 59 If several bishops take part in the same celebration, only the presiding bishop carries the crosier. Latin Rite clergy other than bishops, in particular any who are abbots or apostolic prefects or ordinary of a personal ordinariate, may wear pontifical items. Mitre, crosier and ring are bestowed on an abbot at his blessing and the pectoral cross is a customary part of an abbatial habit. There are limitations as to where and when abbots may wear pontificalia, for example only within his monastery. The practice of granting other clergy (e.g. the highest level of monsignor) special permission to wear such items as a mark of honour has almost disappeared; it is still practiced, however, for ordinaries of a personal ordinariate. Eastern Christianity An Eastern Catholic bishop of the Syro-Malabar Church along with other priests A Byzantine Rite bishop blessing with dikirion and trikirion upon being vested The pontifical vestments in Eastern Christianity are somewhat similar, although Greek terms are used instead of the mainly Latinate forms used in the West. There are also certain vestments which are unique to the Christian East. In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches bishops use the following vestments (worn over the priestly sticharion, epimanikia and epitrachelion) and implements: *mitre *omophorion *sakkos *jewelled pectoral cross *panagia *engolpion *crosier *epigonation The distinctive vestment of a bishop is the omophorion. There are two types of omophoria, the \\"Great Omophorion\\" which is worn at certain moments during the Divine Liturgy and at the Great Doxology at the All-Night Vigil, and the \\"Little Omophorion\\" which is worn at other times (note that the sticharion is worn only at Liturgy, while the epimanikia and epitrachelion are always worn when vesting). The Sakkos is normally worn only when the bishop is celebrating the Divine Liturgy, or during the Great Doxology at the All-Night Vigil. At other services, or when he is \\"presiding\\" but not serving at Liturgy, he will wear the Mantya, a cape with a long train and red and white ribbons (\\"rivers\\") running along the sides. Whenever he blesses, the bishop stands on an orletz (\\"eagle rug\\"), and at certain times he blesses using dikirion and trikirion. The dikirion is a candlestick with two candles symbolising the dogma of the two natures of Christ and trikirion has three candles symbolising the Trinity. Eastern bishops do not normally make use of an ecclesiastical ring; instead, the lower clergy and faithful kiss the bishop's right hand as a sign of respect. As in the Latin Rite, an hegumen (abbot) is presented with his crosier by the local bishop. The abbot usually wears a gold pectoral cross, and may be granted the right to wear a mitre. An archpriest may also be granted a gold pectoral cross. Archimandrites and protopresbyters wear jewelled pectoral crosses and mitres. The epigonation and/or nabrednnik may be worn by these members of the clergy, or may even be granted on their own as marks of honour to distinguished priests. The right to wear a pectoral cross or mitre may be bestowed upon other (lower) clergy as a sign of honour due to some outstanding achievement or dedication.

History  A first Diocese of Campagna was established on 19 July 1525, on territories split off from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Salerno and the Diocese of Satriano, the bishop of that see cumulated as first Bishop of Campagna, and his successors continued to do so. On 27 June 1818, it was suppressed and its territory (not the title) merged into the Diocese of Sant’Angelo dei Lombardi–Bisaccia.

The British were attempting to blockade the port to stop valuable treasure convoys leaving for Spain. However tropical disease took its toll of the seamen to the extent that the British had to leave to re-crew, during which time the Spanish were able to re-commence shipping operations. Background Spain and Britain had come into conflict during the 1720s over a number of issues, and had recently been at war with each other during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. Disputes over trade were a major cause of aggravation to Anglo-Spanish relations, combined with a fear in Britain that Spain had made an alliance with Austria as the precursor to declaring war on Britain and its ally France. The British decided to try to weaken Spain and discourage them from pursuing the Austrian alliance by denying the Spanish the treasure fleets on which metropolitan Spain had become dependent. In March 1726 an expedition was sent to the Spanish West Indies, under Rear-Admiral Francis Hosier, for the purpose of blocking up the Spanish galleons or seizing them should they venture out. The former privateer and governor of the Bahamas Woodes Rogers, who was in London at the time, was consulted by the Government as to the probable means and route the Spaniards would adopt to get their treasure home. From past experience Rogers probably knew more than any other person then in England of the difficulties of the voyage, and in conjunction with Capt. Jonathan Denniss,Probably the same Capt. Denniss who in 1718 conducted an expedition to Havana, the proceedings of which are in PRO CO 137,13; Denniss was also associated with Leonard Cocke, a factor of the South Sea Co. in Santiago de Cuba.

Denniss\\". =Blockade= Hosier's fleet appeared off Bastimentos Island, to the west of Porto Bello on 16 June 1726.Marley, D. op cit p.24 Following orders ultimately from Walpole to blockade Porto Bello but not to take it, Hosier remained before it, allowing no ships to go in or come out without strict examination. On first arrival of the squadron several Spanish ships were captured. The Spanish convoy unloaded its valuables and waited. After remaining for six months, yellow fever made such havoc among his seamen that he was compelled to return to Jamaica, where he recruited fresh crews. Two months later, he was again at sea and continued to cruise in the Caribbean Sea in front of Cartagena, still losing men to the disease. Furthermore, this absence from Porto Bello made the blockade ineffective, and in January 1727, Antonio de Gaztañeta slipped a Spanish treasure fleet with 31 million pesos on board through the British blockade reaching Spain on 8 March 1727. The incidence of fever was accelerated by a disregard for basic sanitation and hygiene in the British fleet.Kemp 1970, p. 74 Between three and four thousand British sailors died of disease out of a complement of 4,600. Hosier himself died of yellow fever on 23 August 1727. His body was wrapped in a sheet and left in the hold of his flagship for four months, until a ship was found to return it to England for burial. Hosier was temporarily replaced by Edward St. Lo, who maintained the blockade and returned to Jamaica to resupply and refit the fleet when it was clear the Spanish fleet would not leave port. In Jamaica he was replaced by Edward Hopson in January 1728, but regained command when Hopson succumbed to disease the following May. St. Lo continued to command the blockading fleet until April 1729, when he too died of a tropical malady. By this time, preliminary peace terms had been agreed between the two powers, and the fleet returned home. The war came to a formal end with the signing in November 1729 of the Treaty of Seville. =Fleet= The fleet comprised 20 ships, including the following:Marley, David. Wars of the Americas, a Chronology of Armed Conflict in the New World, 1998, p.24 *, 70 guns, Flagship *, 70 guns *, 70 guns *, 64 guns *, 60 guns *, 60 guns *, 60 guns *, 50 guns *, 50 guns *HMS Tiger, 50 guns *HMS Dragon, 50 guns *, frigate *, sloop *HMS Happy (Return?), snow =Aftermath= This disaster caused an outrage in Britain and Hosier became an easy scapegoat, being blamed for a lack of initiative, although in reality his hands had been tied by Admiralty orders, stemming from Walpole's wish to avoid war with Spain. At the beginning of the maritime War of Jenkins' Ear (1739–42) the disaster still had not been forgotten and following Admiral Vernon's Capture of Porto Bello on 21 November 1739 with only 6 ships, which vindication raised the British public's joy to fever pitch, and inspired the writing of Rule, Britannia! Britannia Rule the Waves!, Richard Glover wrote a spirited ballad, Hosier's Ghost, Admiral Hosier's Ghost which further excited the British nation against the Spaniards, but was primarily designed to shame Walpole and the anti-war faction for his 1726 orders of inaction, which many considered had been a betrayal of Hosier and his men.

It was first published in Smart Set in October 1919.Uncle Valentine and Other Stories: Willa Cather's Uncollected Short Fiction, 1915-29, University of Nebraska Press; Dec 1973, page 139 Plot summary Paul Wanning, a New York City lawyer, has been told he is terminally ill. His wife tries to belittle the news, and seems more interested in settling their daughters, who take dance lessons. Paul visits his son who lives in Washington Square and tells him he would like to see him get married before he dies. He then visits his friends by Astor Place, who suggest introducing him to their doctors, but they soon lose interest. In his office, he decides to write a letter to an old friend of his, and his copyist Annie Wooley types it for him. She cries upon hearing the content as her own father has passed . The following Summer, the Wannings all go off on holiday - Roma goes to Genoa to visit her friend Jenny, Harold goes to Cornish, and Mrs Wanning and Florence go to York Harbor, where Mr Wanning is supposed to join them. However, he spends much of the summer in New York City, where he takes up Annie as his personal secretary. This makes his other partners and his stenographer talk, especially when he takes her out to dinner or to the theatre. The girl's father tells him he hopes her daughter is not misbehaving, and he explains she is only bringing him kindness in this distressful time. In September, Paul dies. Alongside his will comes a letter to his wife, asking her to give $1000 to Miss Wooley. When Harold hears about that, he decides not to tell his mother and instead he fires the girl.

Published every other week, it has a circulation of 11,000 print copies and is the largest print publication serving the LGBT community in the American Southeast. The paper traces its origins to the monthly newsletter of the Queen City Quordinators, a Charlotte LGBT organization, which they began publishing in 1983. In 1986, Qnotes changed to a monthly tabloid. In 2006, it merged with the Raleigh, N.C. LGBT newspaper The Front Page. General information Q-Notes is published every other week on Saturdays, with a print circulation of approximately 11,000. It is distributed in all major cities in North Carolina and in Columbia, South Carolina and by subscription. The paper covers news, politics, opinion, entertainment, art, lifestyle and other topics. It is the largest LGBT news publication in the Carolinas, with reach to parts of Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia. It is the largest LGBT print news publication in the Southeast. Origins Q-Notes was originally started in 1983 as a monthly newsletter, named Queen City Notes, printed on 8.5x11 paper and distributed by the now defunct Queen City Quordinators, a local non-profit LGBT community organization. The newsletter was published for two years and grew to 12 pages an issue with paid advertising. It ceased publication due to lack of volunteer manpower. In 1986 Q-Notes was reborn as a monthly print newspaper published by Queen City Quordinators and later under the auspices of C.A.N. (Charlotte Advocacy Network) Inc., a for-profit corporation. The first issue of the revised newspaper was distributed in June 1986. Don King was hired part-time as the paper's first editor. QCQ President Jim Yarbrough, Dean Gaskey, Joel Smith and Robert Sheets kept the publication operating until it was bought by Yarbrough in December 1989. In 1991, Yarbrough left another job to take over operation of the publication full-time. Jim Yarbrough, the owner of Pride Publishing and Typesetting, Inc., bought the publication from C.A.N. Inc. in December 1989. In 1996, Q-Notes began distributing every other week. Distribution The paper is distributed in several cities and towns across the Carolinas. Besides its hometown of Charlotte, it is distributed in Asheville, Chapel Hill; Columbia; Durham; Greensboro; Greenville; Raleigh; Wilmington, Winston-Salem and more. The paper also has distribution points and subscribers in Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia. The newspaper is also published online, with daily news updates, event calendars and community resource listings. Developments, controversies and notoriety= Merger with The Front Page= On May 12, 2006, Q-Notes merged with the Raleigh, N.C., based The Front Page, a Raleigh, N.C. LGBT newspaper founded in 1979. =Online presence= On April 17, 2008, Q-Notes debuted its new website. The new incarnation of the almost decade-old website featured daily news updates and staff blogs and allowed reader comments to be posted to any story. The site is using a modified version of the WordPress blogging platform as a content management system The older version of the paper's website had been a simple and static HTML design, requiring hours of behind-the-scenes construction for each bi-weekly issue. In January 2010, the newspaper unveiled a newly redesigned website. =2008 Democratic presidential primary= On April 30, 2008, seven days prior to the May 6, 2008, North Carolina primary, Q-Notes published online three interviews. Two were with Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The third was with Clinton aide Mark Walsh. Obama's interview also included comments from aide Eric Stern. Chris Crain, former editor of The Washington Blade criticized Q-Notes coverage as it did not include information that the interviews had been conducted via email. Q-Notes later edited their Q&As; including notations that the interviews were conducted via email. =Physical changes= For the July 26, 2008, issue the Q-Notes staff changed the traditional quarter fold of the newspaper to a flat layout, reflecting the layout more typical of an average, weekly tabloid newspaper or news-magazine. The traditional two sections of the newspaper, the front, more news-oriented section and the back, arts and entertainment section, were rolled into a single stitched section. In late 2008, the paper began using full, front page images on the front cover rather than have story text in a traditional newspaper layout. An example of the Q-Notes front page before the 2010 rebranding and redesign. =Distribution changes, growth= In October 2009, Q-Notes announced it would stop distribution of its print edition to most regions in South Carolina. In a letter from publisher Jim Yarbrough, the newspaper said it would concentrate most South Carolina print copies in the state capital of Columbia. The paper continues to distribute to some community organizations and businesses in Greenville and Myrtle Beach. Despite changes in the newspaper's circulation strategies, the closure of Window Media's Southern Voice and South Florida Blade on November 16, 2009 made the Carolinas newspaper the largest LGBT print news publication in the Southeast. =New editorial direction= In January 2009, Q-Notes began rebranding its print edition and online presence. A new layout for the print edition accompanied an online redesign and new editorial strategy. Former editor Matt Comer wrote, \\"With our change in aesthetics comes a change in our editorial direction. Our bi-weekly print issues will be more future-oriented and contain less reporting of events past, while GoQnotes.com takes up a more robust daily presence with online only reporting of Carolinas, national and international events and news...In an effort to maintain our new, robust website and editorial direction, qnotes will be implementing a sort of \\"web first\\" model. Stories slated to appear in our print editions will be published as they are completed, or as a set of stories in the day or two after we dispatch our content to our printer. No more waiting the painfully slow and long five days between press time and street date.\\" Staff *Publisher: Jim Yarbrough - Oversees daily operation of all aspects of the newspaper, from financial matters to employment and occasional editorial decisions. *Production Director/Special Assignments Writer: Lainey Millen - Oversees physical layout of the paper, graphic design and writes occasionally for special projects, North Carolina news briefs and in-depth reports.

He was pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1974 to 1985. He played for the San Diego Padres, Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. He led the Padres pitching staff in strikeouts in 1975. Biography Spillner attended Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Washington. He played for the San Diego Padres, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox. His first career win was a 5–4 victory over Cincinnati on May 23, 1974. He threw a three-hit, ten-strikeout complete game shutout against Houston on September 11, 1974. He led the Padres in strikeouts in 1975 (104). After suffering through three losing seasons as a Padre starter, he was part of the major leagues' busiest bullpen in 1977: He and Dave Tomlin each had 76 appearances; Rollie Fingers, 78. A Cleveland starter in 1980, Spillner was 16–11 despite a 5.29 ERA. He was two outs away from a no-hitter on August 20 before rookie Leo Sutherland had a single off him in a 3-0 victory over the White Sox; the no-hitter would have been the first in the AL since Bert Blyleven's on September 22, 1977. He had one fine year as an Indians reliever, going 12–10 (2.49) with 21 saves in 1982. On July 29 of that year, he entered a game with two outs and the bases loaded in the eleventh, induced Paul Molitor to fly out to end the inning, and picked up the win in a 12-inning, 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. At the end of July that year, The Toledo Blade called him \\"one of the league's best\\" relief pitchers, after he had a 1.93 ERA and 12 saves to that point. For his career, he compiled a 75–89 record, with a 4.21 ERA, 878 strikeouts and 50 saves in 556 appearances. Spillner, who relied mostly on a fastball, was prone to giving up home runs. Baseball author Bill James wrote that Spillner was the worst hitting pitcher of the 1970s. For his career, Spillner had a .077 batting average, with 10 hits in 130 at bats, no home runs, and one run batted in.

Based on the original BBC children's Saturday morning show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, which ran on BBC One from 1976 to 1982, it was hosted by Barney Harwood, along with veteran puppet character Basil Brush, from whom the show takes its title. New format The new version of Swap Shop was broadcast live, and featured games and comedy sketches, as well as the \\"swap shop\\" itself (the studio audience brought items to exchange for this feature). Unlike the original series, this new format regularly features gungings for those taking part in the games. A total of three series were produced. In series 3, the name of the programme was changed to Basil and Barney's Swap Shop. History=Series 1= The first series ran for thirteen episodes of one hour. In addition to main presenters Basil Brush and Barney Harwood, Melvin Odoom (ex regular of Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow and regular of The Slammer) was a featured performer who took a central role in many of the comedy sketches and games. Celebrity guests included David Schneider and Joe Pasquale. Series one of Basil's Swap Shop featured gungey games. \\"Question Line\\", a game where children ask the celebrity guest questions and if the celebrity chooses to answer it the child doesn’t get gunged. If however, the celebrity chooses not to answer the question the child asking the question slides into the gunge tank (a pool of gunge similar to the one on Waaa!!!). The children move as they are sitting in or lying across a rubber ring on a ramp with their legs hanging out on the \\"gungeulator\\" a red and white travelator. If the child does slide into the gunge tank then they have to move over and sit in the gunge tank until the game is over. Another game called Dunk Beds, is where there are 3 teams of 2 children, 1 is on a bed attached to a platform and the other child is off the bed. The child off the bed pushes the bed off along the platform, where along the platform are scoring zones. Up to a point, the points are negative then past a certain point, the points become positive until finally off the scale. If the bed goes off the scale the child on the end of the bed slides into a tank of green coloured water. 0 points are awarded if the child gets dunked. Each child from each team is on the bed once during the duration of the game. In the final Game, the final 2 children, left over from the previous game, play on a moving platform called the gungeulator collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, to get them back to the start of the \\"gungeulator\\". If a child falls then he/she is automatically gunged and the child that is left continues the game. However, if the child left wins then prizes are awarded to both the children but if both children are gunged the game is over and no prized are awarded. Whilst playing these games the children are barefoot except the final game where the children are dressed in fat suits wearing trainers on a moving platform =Series 2= Series Two began without Melvin O'Doom on the presenting team. However, the show did feature a new comedy character, Ugly Yeti. The first two episodes did not have Basil live in the studio as he was ill in hospital. The amount of live swaps was reduced from 10 to 5 and popular sketch Zeroes did not return. Celebrity guests included Tom Daley. Team Sam & Lewis were proven to be the best when they made it to the final in Series 2. The credits for the show list Ugly Yeti as being played by Marcus Garvey. This was rumoured to be a reference to Rastafarian leader Marcus Garvey, since some early reggae is played as background music on the show. The \\"question line\\" and \\"gungeulator\\" segments no longer featured. The \\"Gunge Gallery\\" along with a tweaked \\"dunk beds\\" featured instead. The \\"Gunge Gallery\\" is five gunge tanks in a row in which children (members of a karate club, football team etc.)would be sat and one child would be chosen to be gunged after each successful swap. Each Child would be gunged by the end of the programme. =Series 3= Marcus Garvey returned to play Ugly Yeti and the name had been changed to Basil and Barney's Swap Shop, not to forget the studio set refurbished. Dunk Beds and Yettis In Space returned, and 'Gold Brush Gold Rush' became the second game during the show. 'Gold Brush Gold Brush' is set in a western style town and the two teams have to power a conveyor belt with buckets of gunge up to a holder - the team who fills their holder goes through to the next game. This series saw host Barney Harwood absent for a few editions for some unknown reasons. Johny Pitts (of CBBC's Roar and Help! Teach is Coming to Stay) was the official guest presenter filling in for Barney. Marcus Garvey who plays the Ugly Yeti had often been absence too. Special features in the series included 'Britain's Swaps Talent' where presenter Barney had to swap a talent of his with one of another person or two who performs a talent for him. Also the series included more comedy sketches featuring a wide range of characters, from Quiz Show Colin to Big Parrot, Little Pirate. Basil's Game Show A spin-off to the main Saturday morning show, this show consisted of only the games and some comedy from the previous Saturday broadcast; this show did not feature any swaps, or the celebrity interviews. Dunk Beds Dunk Beds was a regular game on the show, in which one member of a team had to push a bed along a track with each part of it scored depending on how far it went. If the contestants pushed too hard, the bed would fall into a pool of green gunge. George Sampson was a contestant on the game before he was known as a contestant on the second series of Britain's Got Talent. Winner of BBC's Election (CBBC) Quincy Washington was also on Basil's Swap Shop competing against George Sampson. It returned for series 2 under the name \\"Dunk Beds: Dunk Harder\\", with contestants pushing a bunk bed.

Intended to sway the US population in favour of Britain's plight, it was produced by the GPO Film Unit for the British Ministry of Information and distributed throughout the United States by Warner Bros..Kevin Jackson Humphrey Jennings, 2004, London: Picador, p429. The film was directed by Humphrey Jennings and Harry Watt, and narrated by US war correspondent Quentin Reynolds. Plot The film opens with shots of the London streets in late afternoon, as people begin their commute home. The narrator reminds the audience that these people are part of the greatest civilian army the world has ever known, and are going to join their respective service before London's \\"nightly visitor\\" arrives. Listening posts are stationed as far away as the coastline and the \\"white fingers\\" of searchlights touch the sky. Soon the Luftwaffe bombers arrive and begin their nightly work, bombing churches, places of business and homes, the work of five centuries destroyed in five seconds. But as soon as it is morning the British people go back to work the way they usually do, demonstrating the British 'stiff upper lip' attitude. Joseph Goebbels is quoted as saying that the bombings are having a great effect on British morale. He is right, the narrator says, the British people's morale is higher than ever. Reception Scene from Britain Can Take It, the Oscar-nominated version of London Can Take It! edited for US viewers Via an agreement with Warner Bros., the film was widely distributed in the United States of America by the British Ministry of Information with the intention of turning public opinion into favouring the USA declaring war on Germany. It did so particularly by depicting the war's effect on ordinary people, rather than on Britain as an outdated imperial power as she was often depicted by anti-war voices in America. A shorter domestic version was released as Britain Can Take It. The film was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941 for Best Live Action Short Film, One-Reel. In Popular Culture The film is edited and set to music by Public Service Broadcasting as one of the songs on their War Room EP.

He was a left-handed pitcher who worked in 175 Major League games, all but eight in relief, over ten seasons (1975–1983; 1985) for the Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, Cleveland Indians and Montreal Expos. Glynn stood tall and weighed . He is one of the few players in the history of the Mets who grew up in the neighborhood where the team has played since , Flushing, Queens.Centerfieldmaz.com web site When Glynn was a student at Francis Lewis High School, he sold hot dogs at Shea Stadium during Mets' games in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result, when he later played for the Mets at Shea, the team honored him in a pre-game ceremony in which he was presented with an official Shea Stadium hot dog. Glynn, however, was bypassed by his hometown team when he graduated from high school in 1971, signing as an undrafted free agent with the Detroit Tigers on September 25, 1971. He worked his way up through the Tiger farm system for four seasons, until he won 11 games in a season split between the Montgomery Rebels and the Evansville Triplets. On September 19, 1975, he made his Major League debut in relief against the eventual American League champion Boston Red Sox. Entering the game in the fourth inning of a 4–4 tie, he struck out the year's AL Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year, Fred Lynn, to snuff out a Boston rally, but one inning later gave up the winning runs on a two-run single by Rico Petrocelli, as Boston won 7–5.1975-9-19 box score from Retrosheet Nine days later, Glynn made his first MLB start, lasting six innings against the Milwaukee Brewers and allowing three earned runs. He took the loss, however, as the Tigers were shut out by Larry Anderson. Glynn spent 1976–1978 bouncing between Detroit and the Tigers' Triple-A Evansville affiliate, and was acquired by the Mets during spring training of . Starting the year with the Triple-A Tidewater Tides, Glynn was effective in 17 relief appearances and was recalled by the Mets to make his National League debut on June 1, 1979. He earned a save in his maiden NL appearance, working a scoreless eleventh inning against the Atlanta Braves and preserving a 5–4 victory for Skip Lockwood.1979-6-1 box score from Retrosheet He worked in 46 games, all in relief, that season, and collected a career-high seven saves. Then, he spent the full season with the Mets — his only full season in the Majors. Traded to the Indians just prior to the opening of season, he spent much of that year in Triple-A but returned to Cleveland in May 1982 to work in a career-high 47 games and earn five victories in seven decisions. He then began with the Indians, but was ineffective and returned to the minor leagues. His final Major League appearances came in relief in May for the Expos. He retired for the 1988–1989 seasons before attempting a brief comeback with the Tidewater Tides in 1990. All told he pitched in 17 pro seasons. As a big leaguer, Glynn allowed 261 hits and 151 bases on balls in 264⅔ innings pitched. He struck out 184 and earned 12 total saves.

It succeeded the rubber clothing companies Apsley Rubber Company and Goodyear Gossamer Company. It operated in its various guises from 1885 to the 1930s. Today the Firestone-Apsley factory building is owned by Hudson Lock, LLC, which produces keys, locks, and related goods. History The Goodyear Gossamer Company was founded in 1885 in Hudson, Massachusetts, by businessman and later United States congressman Lewis Dewart Apsley and his partner J. H. Coffin of Boston. This company produced rubber or \\"gossamer\\" clothing. Within five years, Goodyear Gossamer Company became the largest producer of gossamer garments in the nation.The Hudson Historical Society 1976 In 1892 Apsley purchased Coffin's share of Goodyear Gossamer and reincorporated it as the Apsley Rubber Company.Halprin 2001: 27Halprin 2008: 28 This company produced rubber clothing and footwear. Apsley expanded the company's brick factory building in 1916.Halprin 2008: 9 The plant employed between 1200 and 2000 people during its existence, more than half of all people employed in Hudson during that time period. In 1921 Apsley sold his company and factory buildings to the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. The plant was renamed the Firestone-Apsley Rubber Company and started producing tires. A new brick smokestack with the word \\"FIRESTONE\\" spelled out on it in white-painted bricks was built by the Firestone Company. The factory helped attract immigrants from all over Europe to Hudson. In 1928 at least 19 different languages were spoken by Firestone-Apsley workers.Halprin 2001: 7 The factory folded in the 1930s during the Great Depression. From the 1940s through 1960s the former Firestone-Apsley factory buildings housed Victory Plastics. This company produced plastic footwear and 18 million plastic scabbards for knives and machetes during World War II. Victory Plastics was recognized with an Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for its contributions to the war effort. Victory continued producing scabbards and other war materiel for use during the Korean War, including plastic-encased land mines designed in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company. The company also added various plastic consumer goods such as thermal cocktail pitchers and condiment sets to their production line. Since 1963 the plant has housed Hudson Lock, LLC, which produces keys, locks, locksmithing tools, and related goods. The Firestone smokestack still stands. It is quite possibly the tallest structure in the town of Hudson, but is now shorter than its original height. Sometime in 2017 the smokestack was damaged — or perhaps intentionally lowered for safety reasons — such that it now reads \\"IRESTONE.\\" NotesReferences  See also *Firestone Tire and Rubber Company External links *Hudson Lock, LLC Website Category:Bridgestone Category:Companies based in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Hudson, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Industrial buildings and structures in Massachusetts Category:1885 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1885 ","title":"Firestone-Apsley Rubber Company"},{"id":"15061975","text":"Talmage Holt Farlow (June 7, 1921 - July 25, 1998) was an American jazz guitarist. He was nicknamed \\"Octopus\\" because of how his large, quick hands spread over the fretboard. As Steve Rochinski notes, \\"Of all the guitarists to emerge in the first generation after Charlie Christian, Tal Farlow, more than any other, has been able to move beyond the rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic vocabulary associated with the early electric guitar master. Tal's incredible speed, long, weaving lines, rhythmic excitement, highly developed harmonic sense, and enormous reach (both physical and musical) have enabled him to create a style that clearly stands apart from the rest.\\"Rochinski, Steve (1994). The Jazz Style of Tal Farlow: The Elements of Bebop Guitar Hal Leonard. Where guitarists of his day combined rhythmic chords with linear melodies, Farlow placed single notes together in clusters, varying between harmonically enriched tones. As music critic Stuart Nicholson put it, \\"In terms of guitar prowess, it was the equivalent of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile.\\"Stuart Nicholson, \\"Axe of the Apostles,\\" Wire, September 1990, p. 72 Biography Tal Farlow at Keystone Korner, SF, playing with Red Norvo, 7/28/1981 Talmage Holt Farlow was born in Greensboro, in 1921. He taught himself how to play guitar, which he started when he was twenty-two years old. He learned chord melodies by playing a mandolin tuned like a ukulele. He said playing the ukulele was the reason he used the higher four strings on the guitar for the melody and chord structure, with the two bottom strings for bass counterpoint, which he played with his thumb. His only professional training was as an apprentice sign painter. He requested the night shift so he could listen to big band standards on the shop radio. He listened to Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong, and Eddie Lang. His career was influenced by hearing Charlie Christian playing electric guitar with the Benny Goodman band. He said he made his own electric guitar because he couldn't afford one. Farlow employed artificial harmonics and tapped his guitar for percussion, creating a flat, snare drum sound or a hollow backbeat like the bongos. His large, quick hands earned him the nickname \\"The Octopus\\". He caught the public's attention in 1949 when he was in a trio with Red Norvo and Charles Mingus. In 1953, he was a member of the Gramercy Five led by Artie Shaw, and two years later he led his own trio with Vinnie Burke and Eddie Costa in New York City. After getting married in 1958, he partially retired and settled in Sea Bright, New Jersey, returning to a career as a sign painter. He continued to play occasional dates in local clubs. In 1962 the Gibson Guitar Corporation, with Farlow's participation, produced the \\"Tal Farlow\\" model. He made one album as a leader from 1960–1975. In 1976, Farlow started recording again. A documentary about him was released in 1981. Later in his career Tal performed as a member of Great Guitars with a DVD released in 2005 after his death. Farlow died of esophageal cancer at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center in New York City on July 25, 1998, at the age of 77.

The city of Latmus, located on the south slopes of Mount Latmus east of Miletus,Turkish Milet, not to be confused with Turkish Milas. was originally a port on the narrow gulf, as reported by Strabo. He also states that Latmus is the same as Mount Phthires in the Catalogue of Trojans.Iliad Book II line 868. The mouth of the Gulf of Latmus began to fill with sediment from the Maeander (Büyük Menderes) river, which emptied into it, even in classical antiquity. By 300 CE Lake Bafa had formed behind the estuary marshes. It gradually diminished in salinity and would now be fresh water except that canals to the Aegean introduce a saline element. The ecology remains a brackish-water one and the lake has been made a bird sanctuary. Its area of with a maximum depth of still extends from the base of the west spur of Mount Latmus, although, having lost its port, the ancient medium-sized town of Heraclea ad Latmum has declined in size and facilities to the small village of Kapikiri. Beşparmak looms far beyond Kapikiri to the east for a total distance of about , to wide. It is deeply eroded by various streams into spurs. The spur that can be seen from Kapikiri is one Dağ, or \\"mountain\\", but the entire ridge with all the spurs is Dağlar, \\"mountains\\", in the sense of \\"range.\\" The ancient writers generally recognized the western spur over the gulf as Latmus, but Strabo reports that the ridge east was called Mount Grium and extended through Caria. Geology The Arabian plate at 15 converges into the Anatolian Plate at 21 against the purple line (East Anatolian Fault). The Anatolian Plate moves west slipping along the North Anatolian Fault (green) but there is some north-south extension along the red border, which continues into the Aegean Plate at 37. It is opening the old subduction zone and uncovering the massifs, which have arisen as the Cyclades and the Menderes Massif. The morphotectonic configuration of Anatolia and the Aegean is a result of continental drift movements associated with the Alpine orogeny, a zone of mountain-building caused by the collision of the African and Arabian Plates with the Eurasian Plate. The former have been slipping under the latter compressing and lifting the edge and creating zones of metamorphic rock from previous layers of sedimentary rock. These zones in the Aegean are represented by a number of massifs that were originally buried by crustal subduction: the Rhodope, Kazdag, Menderes, Cycladic Massif and Crete. For various geologic reasons, modelled differently by different geologists, the zone of compression in the Aegean became one of extension: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by isostasy. In the case of the Menderes Massif, which is , the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults. As the northward-pressing Arabian Plate pushes against this wedge the latter slips to the west but the broad end opens along fault lines like the rays of a fan, extending the massif to the north-northeast and south. This is being called a bivergent (diverges in two places) model. The entire massif is divided or nearly so by a karst topography into three sections: the Gordes Massif north of the Alasehir or Gediz graben, the Cine Massif south of the Büyük Menderes graben and the Central Massif between. The latter is split like a forked tongue by the Küçük Menderes Graben into the Kuzey Detachment to the north and the Guney Detachment to the south. Mycale is part of the Guney Detachment, while Latmus is in the Cine Massif. The Graben are low-key rift valleys. There have been some small intrusions of magma into the graben appearing now as granito- diorite outcrops. Dates on thin sections of monazite obtained from the earliest exhumed rocks of the graben suggest \\"... that the Cenozoic extension in the Gordes Massif, and possibly the entire Menderes Massif, might have begun in the Late Oligocene.\\" Despite the rare intrusions, the massif is not of volcanic origin. Most of the visible layer is light, metamorphic rock of various kinds, especially marble and schists. Except for alluvial fans of impermeable clay the rock is highly porous due to a network of small faults, which dips into the warmer regions below the surface. Warm springs and vapors are common, giving the appearance of volcanic activity. The ancients cross- culturally viewed these phenomena as being caused by divinities, which rock- paintings indicate they worshipped. The north slopes of Latmus are subject to heavy and damaging mudslides, which also would have contributed to the idea that it was a god. Mythology Latmus is probably alluded to by Homer, when he speaks of the mountain of the Phthirians, in the neighbourhood of Miletus. Latmus appears in Greek mythology as the site of the cave where Selene's consort Endymion lies forever young and beautiful in blissful sleep.Apollod. 1.7.5; Ovid, Tr. 2.299; Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 3.28; Prehistory Beginning in 1994 about 170 rock paintings have been discovered in shallow caves and overhangs near springs at the foot of Mount Latmus overlooking Lake Bafa. They came to light in a survey conducted by Anneliese Peschlow of the German Archaeology Institute.Deutsches Archäologisches Institut. Peschlow dates the earliest to about 6000 BCE and believes from other findings that the region has been continuously occupied since then. She is currently working to get Mount Latmus reserved as a national park. The paintings, which are done entirely in red, depict mainly social and religious scenes. Different representations of the mountain include a dragon, indicating that it was worshipped as a god; that is, Latmus was a sacred mountain at least as early as the Early Bronze Age. A 2004 palynological study of two sediment cores taken from Lake Bafa near Kapikiri (Baf S1) and from the western depth (Baf S6) suggests a habitation sequence of the Büyük Menderes River valley and the shores of Latmus that appears to support the early history of the region. Baf S1, containing the oldest sediment, is layered in four subsections, the first carbon dated to before 4000 BCE. From the pollen of subsection 1 a model can be constructed of a lightly grazed climax forest of deciduous oak and pine: 27.6% Quercus pubescens, 14.6% Pinus and lesser concentrations of Isoetes histrix. Low levels of the pasture weed, Plantago lanceolata, indicate a low level of grazing by animals belonging to indigenes that lived somewhere else. There is no evidence that they settled or grew crops in the region. Maeander River's mouth. Subsection 2, dated 1240/1126 BCE to 710/558 BCE, represents a settlement from the Beyşehir Occupation Phase of southern Anatolia, dated there 3500/3000 BP to 1500 BP. It has a specific palynological profile of \\"secondary anthropogenic indicators;\\" that is, not pollen of cultivated plants but of other species growing on cultivated land: certain percentages of Plantago lanceolata, Sanguisorba minor, Pistacia, Platanus, Quercus calliprinos and Juniperus. The Lake Bafu profile shows the replacement of deciduous oak and pine with maquis species: Phillyrea, Cistus, Ericaceae; fruit trees: Olea, Castanea; and farm weeds: Plantago lanceolata and Juniperus. Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by slash and burn. This period corresponds to the settlement of the Carians in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the Leleges, but the evidence is not precise enough to say if the indigenes were all or partly Leleges. As the Carians worshipped Endymion, he may have been brought in at this time. Subsection 3 reveals an abandonment of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, and the spread of Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As this is the time of the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated. History Endymion temple in Heracleia Latmus became a member of the Delian League in the fifth century BCE. In the fourth century the Persian satrap (a Carian) Mausolus of Halicarnassus captured the city by a rusePolyainos 7.23.2 reports the capture of Latmos by Mausolos, and 8.53.4 by Artemisia as sole ruler. and fortified it with a circuit wall;The wall, originally with sixty- five towers (Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites 1976), is one of the best-preserved urban fortifications of Antiquity. under Hellenising influence the city was refounded a kilometer to the westThe old city site became a necropolis. on a rectilinear grid systemThe rectilinear grid of streets typical of Hellenistic foundations is traditionally credited to Alexander's architect Hippodamus of Miletus. as Heracleia under Latmos,Whether or not Alexandria ad Latmum (Alexandria by Latmus) was identical to this Heracleia is still an open question, according to Getzel M.

Fraser, Cities of Alexander the Great (Oxford 1996:28-29) and A.W. McNicoll, Hellenistic Fortifications from the Aegean to the Euphrates (Oxford 1997:75-81). The modern village of Kapıkırı is built among the ruins. The temenos, or sanctuary of Endymion, with pre-Greek origins, was rebuilt in Hellenistic times, and may still be seen on a rise to the south of the ancient city.Pausanias remarked \\"The Eleians and the Herakleians near Miletos tell different stories about Endymion's death; the Eleians show you Endymion's tomb but the Herakleians say he went away to Mount Latmos, where they honour him and have a holy place of Endymion.\\" (v.1.5). The building faces the southwest; it has a cella with a horseshoe-shaped rear wall partly cut out of the bedrock, with an entrance hall and columned forecourt. Heracleia's temple of Athena A temple of Athena at Heracleia reveals its earlier foundation by not being aligned with the Hellenistic street pattern. In Byzantine times, the mountain, known as Latros, became a flourishing monastic centre. According to tradition, the first monastic community was established by Sinaite monks fleeing from the Muslim conquests in the 7th century. By the early 10th century, there were three monasteries, and by 1222, the monastic community of Latros numbered 11 monasteries. It began declining however towards the century's end due to increasing Turkish attacks, and disappeared in the 14th century. Endymion was Christianised as a mystic saint, whose coffin was opened annually and whose bones emitted musical tonesPeter Levi, ed. Pausanias, Guide to Greece 1979:198 note 7. and the site drew pilgrims. In the ninth century, Joseph the Hymnographer was tonsured in the monastery of Latmus. Iron ore was mined in the area as of the early 20th century. In 2018, four kilometers of the ancient stone road, which connects the ancient cities of Alinda and Latmus, have been destroyed by villagers to make way for their olive groves.Ancient road destroyed to make way for villagers’ olive groves in Aydın Gallery File:Herakleia at Latmus 5064.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – Defensive towers File:Herakleia at Latmus 5073.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – Agora File:Herakleia at Latmus 5068.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – Stonework suporting the agora File:Herakleia at Latmus 5071.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – The temple of Athena viewed from the agora File:Herakleia at Latmus 5075b.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – View towards Byzantine castle from temple of Athena File:Kapiri Monastery 5120.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – Monastery on island in Lake Bafa File:Herakleia at Latmus 5062.jpgHerakleia at Latmus – Byzantine Castle File:Kapiri 5083.jpgKapiri village with Lake Bafa in the background See also * Carians * Leleges#Leleges in Anatolia NotesExternal links  * Category:Ancient Greek religion Category:Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Category:Locations in Greek mythology Category:Locations in the Iliad Category:Mountains of Turkey Category:Landforms of Aydın Province Category:Landforms of Muğla Province Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Geography of Aydın Province Category:History of Aydın Province ","title":"Beşparmak Mountains"},{"id":"15062013","text":"His Nose in the Book is a 1920 American short Western film directed by B.

These three works were later collected into a single fixup in three sections, also titled Nightwings. According to Silverberg's introductions, the changes required to turn the three shorter works into a novel were relatively minor. Plot summary In a decadent and caste-based future, humanity is divided into guilds, each having a specific job to do. The members of some guilds appear to have undergone genetic engineering, for instance, the Fliers' ability to fly and the Watchers' ability to use their mental capabilities to watch distant stars. The main character in the novella is a Watcher whose mission is to watch the skies with some sophisticated equipment and to inform the Defenders in the event of an alien invasion. Along with a young Flier girl and a Changeling (who belongs to no guild), he visits the old city of Roum (suspected previously to be called Rome), and becomes entangled in events including the possibility of invasion. Apart from Roum, a number of other great cities are mentioned including Jorslem (Jerusalem), Stambool (Istanbul), Marsay (Marseilles), Donsk (Gdańsk), Nayrub (Nairobi), (Dijon), Palerm (Palermo) and Perris (Paris), but their greatness is relative, as they only have a few thousand inhabitants.

British Steel is currently moored in Dartmouth, Devon and undergoing restoration. History British Steel was designed by Devon-based naval architect Robert Clark, and built in 1970 by Phillip and Son, at Noss, on the River Dart. Launched on 19 August of that year, after a record build time of four months, British Steel was described by Don Holme in his book, \\"The Circumnavigators\\", as representing the absolute pinnacle of modern yacht design and construction at the time, particularly with regard to the use of steel in the building of her hull. It was primarily for this reason, when approached by the erstwhile adventurer and \\"publicity-yachtist\\" Chay Blyth, then state-owned British Steel Corporation (later Corus) agreed to sponsor his plan.

History  Howsham Mill dates back to c.1755 and is attributed to John Carr of York. It was built in the Gothic Revival style both as a working grist mill to grind grains into flour and as an eyecatcher or folly within the formal parkscape of nearby Howsham Hall. The mill was powered by a breastshot waterwheel connected by a gear wheel to millstones that grind the grain into flour. Milling of flour ceased in 1947 and the building fell into decay by the 1960s.  Restoration  New screw turbine In 2004 the Renewable Heritage Trust was formed by local residents with the intention of preserving and restoring the mill. Fund raising, volunteer labour and grant funding, totalling £450,000 has enabled the installation of a new waterwheel and a screw turbine based on the Archimedean screw principle to generate electricity and help fund the project in the long term. The first phase of the restoration was completed in 2007 and involved installing the new waterwheel and Archimedean screw as well as rebuilding the walls and roof of the granary to the north of the main building, allowing the installation of a kitchen and toilets as well as housing the control equipment for the hydro generation. Howsham Mill in 2019The Mill was connected to the National Grid in 2010, allowing electricity generated to be sold. Restoration of the main part of the building was completed in 2013 providing facilities as an environmental study/community centre. A second, larger screw was commissioned in 2018 to provide additional hydro-electric generating capacity.  Restoration Village  In 2006 Howsham Mill was featured on the BBC television programme Restoration Village presented by Griff Rhys Jones. It won the North regional heat and was featured in the live National Final on Sunday 17 September 2006. Although Howsham Mill did not win, a £50,000 Project Planning grant was won by reaching the final.

This protein together with GluD1 belongs to the delta receptor subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. They possess 14–24% sequence homology with AMPA, kainate, and NMDA subunits, but, despite their name, do not actually bind glutamate or various other glutamate agonists. delta iGluRs have long been considered orphan receptors as their endogenous ligand was unknown. They are now believed to bind glycine and D-serine but these do not result in channel opening.  Function  GluD2-containing receptors are selectively/predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum where they play a key role in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and motor coordination. GluD2 induces synaptogenesis through interaction of its N-terminal domain with Cbln1, which in turn interacts with presynaptic neurexins, forming a bridge across cerebellar synapses. The main functions of GluD2 in synaptic plasticity are carried out by its intracellular C-terminus. This is regulated by D-serine, which binds to the ligand-binding domain and results in changes in the structure of GluD2 without opening the channel. These changes may signal up to the N-terminal domain or down to the C-terminal domain to alter protein- protein interactions.  Pathology  A heterozygous deletion in GRID2 in humans causes a complicated spastic paraplegia with ataxia, frontotemporal dementia, and lower motor neuron involvement whereas a homozygous biallelic deletion leads to a syndrome of cerebellar ataxia with marked developmental delay, pyramidal tract involvement and tonic upgaze, that can be classified as an ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) and has been named spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive type 18 (SCAR18). A gain of channel function, resulting from a point mutation in mouse GRID2, is associated with the phenotype named 'lurcher', which in the heterozygous state leads to ataxia and motor coordination deficits resulting from selective, cell-autonomous apoptosis of cerebellar Purkinje cells during postnatal development. Mice homozygous for this mutation die shortly after birth from massive loss of mid- and hindbrain neurons during late embryogenesis.  Ligands  9-Aminoacridine, 9-tetrahydroaminoacridine, N1-dansyl-spermine, N1-dansyl- spermidine, and pentamidine have been shown to act as antagonists of δ2-containing receptors.  Interactions  GRID2 has been shown to interact with GOPC, GRIK2, PTPN4 and GRIA1. A possible correlation between GRID2 and the pre-B lymphocyte protein 3 (VPREB3) has been suggested, due to the apparent importance of B-lymphocytes in the origins of cerebellar Purkinje neurons in humans. Morphological studies conducted in GRID2-knockout mice suggest that GRID2 may be present in lymphocytes as well as in the adrenal cortex, however further studies must be conducted to confirm these claims.

The church began as a medieval parish chapel, dedicated to St Ann, within the Dominican Black Friars church. The new parish church was established in the 16th century to serve the inhabitants of the precincts of the former Dominican monastery, following its dissolution under King Henry VIII. It was near the Blackfriars Theatre, a fact which displeased its congregation. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. History The church of St Ann was built on part of the site of the monastery of the Dominicans or \\"Black Friars\\". The monastery was dissolved by King Henry VIII, and in 1550 the precinct was granted to Sir Thomas Cawarden, the Master of the Revels, who largely demolished the buildings on the site. During the reign of Queen Mary I and King Philip, Cawarden was required to provide a parish church for the residents of the precinct. The interior of the old church having been converted into tennis courts, Cawarden allowed them what John Stow described as \\"a lodging chamber above a stair\\". This building fell down in 1597, and the parishioners purchased an additional piece of ground to the west from Sir George Moore, and rebuilt the church on a larger scale. A warehouse was constructed beneath the new part of the church, at the cost of the parishioners, for the use of Sir Jerome Bowes, who held the land under lease. The rebuilt church was consecrated on 11 December 1597 and named \\"The Church or Chapel of St. Ann, within the Precinct of Blackfriars\\". The new church was probably adapted from the medieval friary chapter house. In 1613 a further piece of ground was purchased. An aisle was added, and a burial vault constructed underneath; the additions being consecrated on 29 July 1617. In 1642, the building was repaired at a cost of £500. St Ann's became a Puritan stronghold; for 46 years the minister was William Gouge, who died in 1653, and was buried in the church. Because it was on former monastic land, St Anne's was a liberty within the City of London and its inhabitants could claim exemption from the rules of the London Guilds.Kirby, Jo, The Painter's Trade in the 17th Century Tate Gallery Technical Bulletin, Volume 20, 1999 As a result, for many years at the end of the 16th century and in the early 17th, the parish of St Anne's was the home of an unusually large number of talented artists who would otherwise have been regulated by the Painter-Stainers Company. These included some English born painters, but mainly artists born overseas (principally from the Netherlands). Among its inhabitants were van Dyck, Janssens and Isaac Oliver.Edmond, M Limners and Picturemakers - New light on the lives of miniaturists and large-scale portrait-painters working in London in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Walpole Society, volume 47, page124 The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. It was not rebuilt; instead its parish was united with that of St. Andrew-by-the- Wardrobe. The site of the church was retained for burials, and the church's existing burial ground, on land once occupied by part of the nave of the friary church, also continued in use. This latter site is known as Church Entry. The two graveyards were closed to burials in 1849, and both are now public gardens.

It is now a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Catanzaro-Squillace. In 2013 there was one priest for every 1,841 Catholics. The original Diocese of Cortone (also Cotrone, now Crotone) had existed from the 6th century. It was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Reggio. History According to local legend the Gospel was preached there by S. Peter the Apostle, or by Dionysius the Areopagite, a follower of S. Paul of Tarsus, and it is claimed that Dionysius was the first bishop.Ughelli IX, pp. 383-384. Cappelletti, p. 188. This is mythmaking, practiced by most dioceses in Italy, in an effort to connect their founding to the Apostles or Disciples of Jesus Christ. Lanzoni, pp. 10, 342. Cotrone (ancient Croton) was besieged by Totila, King of the Goths, in the 540s, without success. At a later date Croton became a part of the Byzantine Empire. About 870 it was taken and sacked by the Saracens, who put to death the bishop and many people who had taken refuge in the cathedral. Later on it was conquered by Normans, and thenceforth shared the fate of the Kingdom of Naples. The first known bishop of Cotrone, according to local tradition, was Flavianus, during whose episcopate occurred the siege of the city by Totila, according to Fernando Ughelli. There is no documentary evidence of his existence. =Cathedral and Chapter= The cathedral of Crotone was dedicated to the Taking up (Assumption) of the body of the Virgin Mary into heaven, and to S. Dionysius the Areopagite. The cathedral was administered and staffed by a corporation called the Chapter, which was composed of four dignities (Archdeacon, Dean, Cantor and Archpriest) and sixteen Canons.Cappelletti, p. 188. Ughelli, p. 383, speaks of six dignities: the Archdeacon, the Deacon, the Archpriest (who acts as Penitentiarius), the Treasurer, and the Primicerius. In 1690, and again in 1793, there were six dignities and eighteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 174, note 1; VI, p. 185. The diocesan seminary was established by Bishop Girolamo Carafa (1664–1683).Taccano-Gallucci, p. 391. =Diocesan synods= A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727.

Bishop Leonardo Todisco Grande (1834–1849) began a general visitation of the institutions of his diocese in 1842, Falcone, p. 134, nos. 202-204. and then presided over a diocesan synod which was held at Crotone on 1–3 June 1845; its constitutions and decrees were published. =Reorganization of 1818= Following the extinction of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, the Congress of Vienna authorized the restoration of the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples. Since the French occupation had seen the abolition of many Church institutions in the kingdom, as well as the confiscation of most Church property and resources, it was imperative that Pope Pius VII and King Ferdinand IV reach agreement on restoration and restitution. Ferdinand, however, was not prepared to accept the pre-Napoleonic situation, in which Naples was a feudal subject of the papacy. Lengthy, detailed, and acrimonious negotiations ensued. In 1818, a new concordat with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies committed the pope to the suppression of more than fifty small dioceses in the kingdom. In the ecclesiastical province of Reggio, to which the diocese of Cotrone belonged, Pope Pius VII, in the bull \\"De Utiliori\\" of 27 June 1818, chose to suppress the diocese of Isola completely, and assigned its people and territory to the diocese of Cotrone. In the same concordat, the King was confirmed in the right to nominate candidates for vacant bishoprics, subject to the approval of the pope. That situation persisted down until the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in 1860.Bullarii Romani continuatio Tomus 15, p. 7 column 1, \\"Articulus XXVIII\\". =Temporary union of three dioceses under one bishop= Changing patterns of settlement and distribution of wealth following World War II had an impact on dioceses which were mostly rural in character. In 1970, the entire diocese of Santa Severina had a Catholic population estimated at 62,000, and was served by 44 priests (1:2000). The diocese of Cariati had some 72,000 Catholics, and 37 priests (1:1945). The diocese of Crotone had an estimated 61,000 Catholics and 37 priests (1:1648).Annuario pontificio 1971 (Citta del Vaticano 1971). In the 17th and 18th centuries, the city of Cotrone had a population estimated at 5,000: Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 174, note 1; VI, p. 185. Bishop Orazio Semeraro of Cariata had been transferred to Brindisi in April 1967; Bishop Raimondi of Crotone had died in June 1971. Archbishop Michele Federici of Santa Severina was transferred to Veroli-Frosinone on 23 December 1973, which cleared the way to a reorganization of diocesan resources in Calabria. On 21 December 1973, Pope Paul VI appointed Msgr. Giuseppe Agostino, who had been the Vicar General of the diocese of Reggio Calabria, Archbishop of Santa Severina and at the same time Bishop of Crotone and Bishop of Cariati, aeque pariter.Acta Apostolicae Sedis Vol. 66 (Citta del Vaticano 1974), p. 50. Cariati was united to the archdiocese of Rossano in 1979, and Santa Severina was united to the archdiocese of Crotone in 1986. =Union of Santa Severina with Crotone= On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Crotone and Santa Severina be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Archidioecesis Crotonensis-Sanctae Severinae. The diocese was to be subject to the metropolitan of Reggio-Bova. The seat of the diocese was to be in Crotone, and the cathedral of Crotone was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedral in Santa Severina was to become a co-cathedral, and the cathedral Chapter was to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Crotone, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Crotone and Santa Severina.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Città del Vaticano 1987), pp. 693-696. =Change of metropolitan= Following the Second Vatican Council, and in accordance with the norms laid out in the Council's decree, Christus Dominus chapter 40,Christus Dominus 40. Therefore, in order to accomplish these aims this sacred synod decrees as follows: 1) The boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces are to be submitted to an early review and the rights and privileges of metropolitans are to be defined by new and suitable norms. 2) As a general rule all dioceses and other territorial divisions that are by law equivalent to dioceses should be attached to an ecclesiastical province. Therefore dioceses which are now directly subject to the Apostolic See and which are not united to any other are either to be brought together to form a new ecclesiastical province, if that be possible, or else attached to that province which is nearer or more convenient. They are to be made subject to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the bishop, in keeping with the norms of the common law. 3) Wherever advantageous, ecclesiastical provinces should be grouped into ecclesiastical regions for the structure of which juridical provision is to be made. major changes were made in the ecclesiastical administrative structure of southern Italy. The provinces of Calabria were addressed by Pope John Paul II in the bull \\"Maiori Christifidelium\\" of 30 January 2001.

The Pontifical is the compendium of rites, for the enactment of certain sacraments and sacramentals which may be celebrated by a bishop, including especially the consecration of holy chrism, and the sacraments of confirmation and holy orders. However, it does not include the rites for the Mass or the Divine Office, which can be found in the Roman Missal and Liturgy of the Hours respectively. Because of the use of the adjective pontifical in other contexts to refer to the Pope, it is sometimes mistakenly thought that the Pontificale Romanum is a book reserved to the Pope. It could be argued that it is the book of those entitled to the use, in certain contexts, of the pontificalia, i.e. episcopal insignia. These are not always limited just to bishops, but according to current Latin Catholic Canon Law can in certain circumstances be used by others including abbots and rulers of dioceses or quasi-dioceses who have not been ordained bishops. The Pontifical has its sources mostly in texts and rubrics which existed in the old sacramentaries and Ordines Romani and were gradually collected together to form one volume for the greater convenience of the officiating bishop. The earliest pontificals date from the late ninth century. From the mid-tenth century, one particular compilation, known to historians as the Pontificale Romano- Germanicum, became dominant, and was widely copied.A convenient though partial and outdated list is given by Victor Leroquais, Les pontificaux. Manuscrits des bibliothèques publiques de France, 4 vols. (1937). Nevertheless, manuscript Pontificals were given various descriptions and a pontifical might well be described with varying degrees of accuracy as a Liber Pontificalis, Liber Sacramentorum, Liber Officialis, Ordinarium Episcopale or a Benedictionale. Under Clement VIII, a standard version was published for the use of the entire Roman Rite, under the title Pontificale Romanum.See the photographic reprint: M. Sodi & A.M. Triacca (edd.), Pontificale Romanum, editio princeps (1595-1596), Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Città del Vaticano, 1997. It was reprinted by authority with many variations many times.A version published by Pope Leo XIII is transcribed on . until 1962,See the photographic reprint: A. Ward & C. Johnson (edd.), Pontificale Romanum, reimpressio editionis iuxta typicam anno 1962 publici iuris factae, CLV-Edizioni Liturgiche, Roma, 1999. after which it was recast and restructured according to the decisions of the Second Vatican Council. The service book should not be confused with the collection of papal annals called Liber Pontificalis, probably first compiled in the 5th or 6th century. Eastern Christianity server holding the Archieratikon for a Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the equivalent of the Pontifical is the Archieratikon (Greek: Ἀρχηιερατικόν; Slavonic: Чиновникъ, Chinovnik). This book is often in a large format and contains only those portions of Vespers, Matins, and the Divine Liturgy which pertain to the bishop (hierarch). It also contains those rites (ordination, the consecration of a church, etc.) which are normally performed only by a bishop.

The teleplay by Peter Buckman was adapted from a story by Peter Shaw. It was broadcast in the United States by Showtime on April 19, 1998 and released on videotape in France the following month. It later was released as a feature film in select foreign markets. Plot Set in 18th Century London, the story focuses on Sweeney Todd (Ben Kingsley), a murderous barber whose business provides him with two profitable sidelines, the sale of his victims' jewelry and the disposal of their bodies to his mistress Mrs. Lovett (Joanna Lumley), who uses them to prepare meat pies for her unsuspecting clientele. American Ben Carlyle (Campbell Scott) arrives in the city to track down wealthy diamond merchant Alfred Mannheim and $50,000 worth of diamonds he had sold to Carlyle's employers but failed to deliver. Mannheim's staff advises Carlyle that their boss disappeared without a trace weeks earlier, and he posts notices offering a reward for information leading to Mannheim's discovery. Charlie (Sean Flanagan), a mute orphan who works as an assistant to Todd, recognizes Mannheim as a man the barber had shaved just prior to his disappearance. Realizing his dastardly deeds are in danger of being revealed, Todd imprisons the boy in his basement. Meanwhile, Carlyle is seeking the assistance of the corrupt local police and an amiable serving wench named Alice, who happens to be Todd's ward, with his quest. When his suspicions about the ingredients of Mrs. Lovett's pies are all but confirmed by a chemist, he hides himself in a burlap sack and has himself deposited in her pie shop cellar with a delivery of meat. There he makes a gruesome discovery that spurs him to confront Mrs. Lovett, who tries to kill him but is knocked out and left to hang on a meat rack. Shortly after, she is arrested. Carlyle then heads over to the barber shop to confront Todd, who overpowers and binds him. As he prepares his instruments to torture Carlyle to death, he explains what led him to a life of murder and cannibalism. Charlie, who has managed to free himself from his shackles, stabs Todd in the back, killing him. He then frees Carlyle, who sets the building on fire before escaping with the boy. Cast * Ben Kingsley as Sweeney Todd * Joanna Lumley as Mrs. Lovett * Campbell Scott as Ben Carlyle * Selina Boyack as Alice * David Wilmot as Tom * Sean Flanagan as Charlie * Katharine Schlesinger as Lucy * John Kavanagh as Rutledge * Joe Savino as Chambers * Niall Buggy as Vicar * Peter Jeffrey as Dr. Maxwell * Peter Woodthorpe as Mannheim Production The character of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, originated in an 1846–47 penny dreadful entitled The String of Pearls. In 1847, George Dibdin Pitt adapted the story for a stage melodrama. A 1936 British film directed by George King was the first screen version. Christopher Bond's 1973 stage adaptation was musicalized by Stephen Sondheim in 1979. Schlesinger's film is a dramatic departure from the previous narratives. It dispenses with all the characters except Todd and Lovett, adds the plotline involving the missing diamonds, and offers a completely different reason for Todd's murder spree. The Victorian era locales were filmed in Dublin, Ireland. Prior to broadcast, the film had its world premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival in October 1997. Critical reception In his review in New York, John Leonard said, \\"Much as I’d have imagined that yet another version of The Tale of Sweeney Todd would be at best inadvisable, Kingsley... is a class-war wonder to behold... Even more of a surprise than Kingsley’s performance is that director John Schlesinger, so very serious in movies like Midnight Cowboy and Marathon Man, would have so much fun with this blackest of humors.\\"New York review Daryl Miller of the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"It is made of seemingly high- quality elements . . . yet it falls flat because of an ill-conceived script and directorial miscalculation.\\"Los Angeles Times review Awards and nominations Ben Kingsley was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie but lost to Christopher Reeve for Rear Window.

The HELLS gene has proved to play critical roles in DNA methylation, chromatin packaging, control of Hox genes, stem cell proliferation, and developing lymphoid tissue. In a developing embryo, epigenetic programming is controlled through the mechanisms of DNA methylation and chromatin organization. These processes are the master regulators that determine which genes are turned on or off throughout development. Lsh, a protein encoded by the HELLS gene is a major regulator of methylation patterns and thus crucial to normal fetal development. Mutations and knockouts of the HELLS gene severely disrupts the process of fetal programming. In mice, knockout of HELLS gene resulted in death of embryos at birth and caused embryonic growth retardation. In humans, hypomethylation caused by a mutation in the HELLS gene is linked to Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome 4 (ICF4). This is a rare disease that causes immunodeficiency, facial anomalies, growth retardation, failure to thrive, and psychomotor retardation. The adverse effects due to the absence and mutation of the HELLS gene is a result of the extensive loss of genomic wide methylation and the abnormal expression of repeat sequences. The disruption in methylation patterns can cause the silencing of genes or the over-expression of genes, leading to abnormal and in some cases fatal developmental consequences. This gene encodes a lymphoid- specific helicase. Other helicases function in processes involving DNA strand separation, including replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. This protein is thought to be involved with cellular proliferation and may play a role in leukemogenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.

It is the sixth installment in Toei's Gendai Yakuza series of unrelated films by different directors, all starring Sugawara. Shot on location in Kawasaki, the plot centers around Okita, a street thug troublemaker released from prison only to discover that the crime underworld in which he used to operate and the socio- political landscape of Japan has changed dramatically. Complex named it number 3 on their list of The 25 Best Yakuza Movies. Home Vision Entertainment released the movie on DVD in North America in 2004. Arrow Films released a special edition blu-ray in Europe and North America in June, 2018. Summary Okita and his street gang cause trouble in Kawasaki, residing in an abandoned warehouse, they extort money and sell girls to brothels. When they are beat up for refusing to give the Takigawa yakuza family a cut, Okita attacks them with a knife and is sent to jail. After being released, he teams up with the yakuza Kizaki and subsequently immerses himself in the new yakuza scene, forming his own gang. He runs into Kimiyo, one of the girls he raped and sold into prostitution, and starts a volatile relationship with her. After crossing the Takigawa family several more times, Okita is injured and forced into joining under Takigawa's rival, the Yato family, to protect himself and effect a truce ceremony with Takigawa. This gives him control of a piece of the entertainment district, giving him an easy life that bores him. Not happy with the truce, Takigawa has talks about uniting with the large Saiei family from Osaka. When Okita disrespects the Saiei boss Owada and refuses to apologize even after Yato commits yubitsume, he is expelled from the Yato family. After nearly his entire gang is killed off one by one, Okita and his two remaining men hole up in the abandoned warehouse. Yato has Takigawa killed and gives the turf to Saiei as a peace offering, promising to get Okita to apologize if they will spare Okita's life. Yato talks Okita into surrendering, with Okita even cutting off a finger. To Yato's surprise, the members of the Saiei family begin beating Okita to teach him a lesson but keep their promise not to kill him. Kimiyo is killed when arrives and tries to stop them, sending Okita into a frenzy that results in him getting killed and Yato getting stabbed.

The gene is located in chromosome 19q13.2 within a cluster including other CYP2 family members such as CYP2A6, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2F1. Expression CYP2S1 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tracts, and skin and in leukocytes of the monocyte/macrophage and lymphocyte series; it is also expressed throughout Embryogenesis and, as discussed below, certain types of cancers.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. In rodents, the homologous protein has been shown to metabolize certain carcinogens although its specific function(s) in humans has not been clearly determined. In in vitro studies, the human enzyme has been found to metabolize all-trans- retinoic acid to 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid and 5, 6-epoxy-retinoic acid and therefore may play a role in processing retinoic acid in tissues where it is highly expressed such as the skin. CYP2S1 is significantly overexpressed and, perhaps directly related to this, its gene is significantly hypometylated (see gene methylation in the skin of Han Chinese patients with psoriasis suggesting that it plays a role in the development of this disease. CYP2S1 has been suggested to be involved in the growth and/or spread of certain tumors of epithelial cell origin: its higher expression in breast or colorectal cancer tissues appears associated respectively with shorter survival times or poor prognoses, and it is more highly expressed in metastasis compared to primary tumor tissues of ovarian cancer. CYP2S1 has recently been assigned epoxygenase activity. It metabolizes 1) arachidonic acid to its various epoxides, i.e., the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (also termed EETs); 2) docosahexaenoic acid to its various epoxides, i.e. the epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (also termed EDPs); and 3) linoleic acid to its various epoxides, i.e. vernolic acid (also termed leukotoxin) and coronaric acid (also termed isoleukotoxin). It seems likely, although not yet tested, that CYP231 will also prove able to metabolize other polyunsaturated fatty acids to their epoxides; for example, the enzyme may metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (also termed EEQs). Animal model studies implicate the EET, EDP, and EEQ epoxides in regulating blood pressure, tissue blood flow, new blood vessel formation (i.e. angiogenesis, pain perception, and the growth of various cancers; limited studies suggest but have not proven that these epoxides may function similarly in humans (see epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, epoxydocosapentaenoic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, and epoxygenase pages). The CYP2S1-dependent production of EETs, which stimulate the growth of various types of cancer cells, including those of the colon (see epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#cancer), could contribute to the unfavorable effects of this CYP in the sited cancers. Vernolic and coronaric acids are potentially toxic, causing multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress when injected into animals and suggested to be involved in causing these syndromes in humans. CYP2S1 has also been found to metabolize Prostaglandin G2 and Prostaglandin H2 to the biologically active product, 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (i.e. 12(S)-hydroxyheptadeca-5Z,8E,10E-trienoic acid, also termed 12-HHT).

This gene encodes a nucleotidase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the 5' deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP) and 2'(3')-dNTP and ribonucleotides, but not 5' ribonucleotides. Of the different forms of nucleotidases characterized, this enzyme is unique in its preference for 5'-dNTP. It may be one of the enzymes involved in regulating the size of dNTP pools in cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2011] Structure cdN is one of seven 5' nucleotidases identified in humans, all of which differ in tissue specificity, subcellular location, primary structure and substrate specificity. Of the seven, the mitochondrial counterpart of cdN, mdN, is the most closely related to cdN. Their genes, NT5M and NT5C, share the same exon/intron organization, and their amino acid sequences are 52% identical. Both cdN and mdN share nearly identical catalytic phosphate binding sites with most members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This enzyme forms a 45-kDa homodimer of two 22-kDa subunits composed of a core domain and cap domain. The core domain is an α/β Rossmann- like fold containing six antiparallel β-strands surrounded by α-helixes, and it spans residues 1-17 and 77-201 of the amino acid sequence. The cap domain is a 4-helix bundle spanning residues 18-76. The cleft formed by the core and cap domains acts as the enzyme's active site, where three conserved motifs in the core domain plus the cofactor Mg2+ serve as the substrate binding site. Meanwhile, the residues Phe18, Phe44, Leu45, and Tyr65 in the cap domain form an aromatic, hydrophobic pocket that coordinates with the base of the nucleotide substrate and, thus, influences the enzyme's substrate specificity. Its two main chain amides form hydrogen bonds with the 4-carbonyl group of dUMP and dTMP and with the 6-carbonyl group of dGMP and dIMP, while repelling the 4-amino group of dCMP and dAMP. The residue Asp43 is responsible for donating a proton to O5’ of the nucleotide during catalysis. Function This enzyme functions in dephosphorylating nucleoside triphosphates, especially the 5′- and 2′(3′)-phosphates of uracil and thymine, as well as inosine and guanine, dNTPs (dUMPs, dTMPs, dIMPs, and dGMPs, respectively). Due to this function, cdN regulates the size of dNTP pools in cells, in conjunction with the cytosolic thymidine kinases, as part of the dNTP substrate cycle. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed, though lymphoid cells display particularly high cdN activity. Clinical Significance The protein cdN is essential to counteract accumulation of cellular dNTPs, as excess dNTPs have been linked to genetic disease. In addition, this enzyme's dephosphorylation function could be applied to anticancer and antiviral treatments which use nucleoside analogs. These treatments rely on the kinase activation of the analogs, which then are incorporated into the DNA of the tumor cell or virus to act as DNA chain terminators. cdN can be used to maintain the concentrations of nucleoside analogs at low levels to avoid cytotoxicity. Moreover, cdN may affect the sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to treatment with ara-C. as low cdN mRNA levels in leukemic blasts have been correlated with a worse clinical outcome. Interactions cdN binds and dephosphorylates deoxyribonucleotides such as uracil, thymine, inosine, and guanine.

The park spans 90,323 hectares, and is located in Karkaraly District. History and administration Lake BaceenThe area first became protected in 1884, as the Karkaralinsk Forest Reserve. In 1889, construction began on many of the parks cordons: Bedaik, Koktube, Ayushat, Tulkebai, Tonkurus and others. In 1913, a wooden cabin meant to serve as the house of the forest warden was constructed. The cabin has since become popular for its charm and location within the park. Pre-Bolshevik Revolution, all former forest cottages were allotted to army troops, Karkaraly Cossacks, and to local people. The Kent and Karkaralinsk forest cottages were part of the Karkaralinsk forest treasury and were state property. After the October Revolution, the entire forest area became part of the state forest fund. Having undergone several administrative changes in 1947, the Karkaraly Forestry Department was organized. In the beginning of the 1990s, work began on the creation of the national park. On December 1, 1998, the Kazakhstani national government passed a decree turning the area into Karkaraly National Park. The primary goal of the national park is the protection and restoration of the natural area within the park boundaries. The administration of the park is broken into four departments: • Administrative Department • Department of protection and wildlife management • Department of science, ecological education and tourism • Department of finance The park has 120 employees. 104 of these are state forest inspectors. Geography 350px The total area of Karkaraly National Park is 90,323 hectares, of which, 40,341 hectares are forested. The park is divided into three sections: the mountain section, the Karkaraly section, and the Kent section. The mountain section is 25,576 hectares in size, the Karkaraly section is 23,846 hectages in size, and the Kent section is 40,901 hectares in size. The park has 22,243 hectares where all forms of economic activities are forbidden. * The park has 89,877 hectares where all economic activities under strict control are allowed. Near the park are two other protected areas: Bektauata National Preserve – 500 ha Beldeutac National Preserve - 44,660 ha In the Paleozoic Age (250-300 million years ago), this area of Kazakhstan was an inland sea. The water retreated 1.2 to 2 million years ago, when the ancient Paleozoic shield was cracked by granite. The area lifted and created the Kent and Karkaraly Mountains. The rocks and cliffs have been here ever since and for many thousands of years the untamable steppe wind and precipitation has sculpted the rocks into unique shapes. People have lived in the Karkaraly area since ancient times. The earliest archeological finds connected with ancient people dates back to the Paleolithic (or Stone) Age. Archeological sites from the Bronze Age have been investigated more often. There are over 30 archaeological sites (from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age) of burial mounds and ancient settlements within the park boundaries. Some of these are the best discovered sites from these periods in Kazakhstan.  Places of interest  left =Nature Museum= Karkaraly National Park built a nature museum in 1983. The two-story wooden building consists of exhibition halls of flora and fauna found in the Karkaraly National Nature Park. In one of the halls of the museum is a 3D map of the national park. The building is known for its beautiful wooden interior. Adjacent to the nature museum is a large wildlife preserve that houses bison, red deer, fallow deer, yak, wild boar and argali. =Lake Baceen= Lake Baceen is located at 1200m above sea level and north-west of the city Karkaraly. You reach the lake on the Eco-Trail “The Stone’s Tale.” Literally translated from Russian, the lake's name is Lake Basin, due to the geological formations surrounding the lake. The lake is small- only .14ha. The lake is only accessible by foot and generally takes 4 hours round-trip. This trail takes you through pine forests, unique rock formations, and beautiful vistas from the lake. =Lake Shaitankol= Lake Shaitankol is one popular areas in the park. The lake got its name, which translates to \\"Devil's Lake\\", allegedly due to a high number of hunters getting lost in the area, sparking rumors that the devil was at work. The lake is located at 1200m above sea level and is west of the city Karkaraly. You reach the lake on the eco-trail “The Legend of Lake Shaitankok.” The lake is accessible by foot and generally takes 5 hours round-trip. The lake is oval in shape and surrounded by rock cliffs up to 10m high. The depth of the lake is unknown. The water level does not decrease throughout the year because it is fed underground water and precipitation. Kent Mountains The Legend of Lake Shaitankol A local legend regarding Lake Shaitankol tells the tale of a tragic love story. According to the legend, long ago there was a beautiful young girl named Sulushash, who was the daughter of a rich land owner named Tleuberdy. Sulushash fell in love with a poor shepherd named Altai, but Tleuberdy did not approve of their relationship and forbade them to see each other. Because of this, the lovers decided to elope, and along with a friend of Altai named Kausar. The three traveled many days across the Kazakh steppe until they arrive in the Karkaraly Mountains, and took shelter at Lake Shaitankol.Lake ShaitankolWhen they reached this area, Altai and Kausar left the girl by the lakeside and went hunting. While hunting for argali, Kausar fell down a cliff and died. In the meantime, Tleuberdy set the forest on fire in an attempt to force them out. Sulushash then hid in a cave, but was overcome by smoke, left the cave and began running. She ran directly into a tiger and in order to save herself from the tiger, Sulushash jumped into the lake and drowned. Having heard Sulushash's cry for help, Altai ran to the lakeside, but all he could see was her hat in the water. Distraught, Altai plunged a dagger into his chest. > right =Big Lake= The most familiar and frequently visited body of water > in the area is Big Lake. It is 2.5 kilometers from Karkaraly.

Kent Mountains =The House of the Forest Warden= This building is one of the most famous buildings in this area. It was built between 1910 and 1913 near the village of Komissarovka. The wooden house was constructed and decorated by the woodcarver Oomeltcen Smetankinym. Construction of the house of the forest warden was completed in 1913. The first owner of this beautiful and interesting structure was forest warden L. S. Sadovnichy. =Kizhel Kensh Palace= Kyzyl-Kensh is in the Kent Mountains and is an architectural monument of the time of the Dzungar invasion of the Kazakh steppe. It is the ruins of Buddhist monastery from the 17th century. It is located in a small valley almost completely surrounded by rocky mountains. The official name of the monument is “Kyzyl Kensh Palace\\", which means \\"red ore\\" or \\"red city\\". The monastery was built here by the Dzungars in the mid-17th century. Ochirtu- Tsetsen Khan ruled them during this time and lived in the monastery of lamas. According to scientists, the monastery was inhabited for as much as 50 years. Then the people left, though it is not known if they left voluntarily or were forced to for some reason. In the 19th century an ethnographic expedition from Tsarist Russia was conducted in the Kent Mountains. They had heard the legend told by local residents and later confirmed the existence of the palace. At this time, part of the complex was still standing. One two-story building was almost untouched. On its inner walls, you could see the remnants of bright red paint. The ceiling was propped up by six wooden columns, carved and covered with gold paint. Outside there were preserved beams. Local residents were afraid to touch the temple. It was believed that those who pollute it, die a terrible death. Unfortunately, the temple was destroyed in the last half of the 1900s. Zealous looters disregarded the historical value of the old buildings destroyed them for logs and stone. Now there is little left that is untouched. Native stonework can only be found beneath a layer of plaster. Modern restorers have begun putting stone slabs back in their places. Kyzyl Kensh Palace But it remains beautiful set of ruins. The main temple was built in the form of a cross. Here, in the central hall is where the Lama prayed. To the right of the main temple is a smaller temple. Here archaeologists have found evidence of treasure hunters. Thieves broke the stone floor and dug a deep hole, as Buddhist treasures were often buried in underground vaults. In front of the main temple is a picturesque artificial reservoir, which is filled with melt-water in the spring. Scientists maintain that it was formed because the monks had removed the clay for the construction of the palace. There are two other buildings in the complex: the kitchen, which is located to the left of the temple, and a house, which is located a bit further from the water. All four buildings are exactly in their original place. This area has always been visited by pilgrims, but they usually settled in their yurts and left the buildings alone. right The excavation of Kyzyl Kensh Palace took more than one expedition. In 1825, the legendary archeologist Ket Gore learned of the site while in Russia and became interested. A later expedition led by General Bronevsky excavated rubble and found many interesting artifacts, which were passed on to the Museum of Semipalatinsk. Some artifacts from the Kyzyl Kensh Palace are located in the archaeological museum of Karaganda State University. Some examples of the recovered artifacts: a Manchurian coin, copper men's ring with a silver insert, parts of the palace such as decorations and hooks, guns and lead bullets that allegedly belonged to the guards, nails, beads, and wooden fretwork with traces of the pattern that were painted with paint from real gold. =The Ancient City of Kent= In the middle of the Kent Mountains is a unique, historical, and cultural monument from the Bronze Age. Archeologists have named the ancient settlement Kent. It was a large city, no less than 30 hectares large, and was home to one thousand people. The town was divided into streets and quarters. There was a quarter for metallurgists, in which copper and bronze has been found. Masters made weapons, equipment, and ornaments. Most likely the inhabitants of Kent were skilled metallurgists. Some ceramics were discovered but were obviously imported, characteristic of southwestern Siberia and Central Asia. Excavations of Kent have amazed archeologist with an abundance of bronze products and unusual subjects. Currently it is thought that they did not have a writing system. Researchers now guess the area was inhabited for 200–300 years. Nobody knows what happened to Kent or why the people left, though there is a popular theory: in the end of the Bronze Age climatic conditions varied and population density simultaneously increased the need for food. This consequently change wildlife populations. For the wildlife to survive, it was necessary to move in search of better pastures. The people of Kent, right at the beginning of the Iron Age, left the area in search of food. left =Aulietas= Aulietas is a location in the Kent Mountains with unique granite rock formations. The formations are a result of the weathering process over the years. This location is a sacred place for local residents. =Beldeutac Natural Reserve= The Beldeutac Natural Reserve neighbors the Karkaraly National Nature Park. Its purpose is to provide conservation of biological diversity of plants and animals. In Beldeutas, there are rare species of animals such as argali, golden eagle, saker falcon, black stork, eagle owl, and Pallas's cat. All of them are in the Red Book of Kazakhstan. Beldeutas has the highest number of argali in the area. Flora and fauna=Fauna= Golden eagle Birds The park is home to 122 species of birds. 11 of these species are in Kazakhstan's Red Book of Protected Species. They are the golden eagle, imperial eagle, steppe eagle, booted eagle, saker falcon, Eurasian eagle-owl, Dalmatian pelican, black stork, whooper swan, swan goose, and Pallas's sandgrouse. Of these, the imperial eagle, saker falcon, and Dalmatian pelican are protected internationally under the IUCN Red List. The park also has the lesser kestrel, which is protected internationally under the IUCN. Mammals Argali The park has 45 species of mammals, including wolves, foxs, badgers, wild boar, red deer, Siberian roe deer, elk, argali, lynx, various bats, and others. The argali in the national park are one of six subspecies of argali living in Kazakhstan. In the Karkaraly National Nature Park the highest numbers of argali are in the Kent Mountains and in the neighboring Beldeutas Natural Reserve. The argali are protected under Kazakhstan's Red Book of Protected Species. Pallas's cat The Pallas's cat is the size of a domestic cat, but it is different from an ordinary cat it that it has a dense body with short thick legs and very thick hair. Its eyes are yellow and unlike the domestic cat, its pupils remain round when looking at bright light. This species is very rare. The population continues to decline and they are on the verge of extinction. The exact number of this species is unknown because of its secretive behavior and wide distribution. Reptiles and amphibians The park is home to six species of reptiles and two species of amphibians, including four species of snakes. Two are venomous: the meadow viper and the Siberian pit viper. =Flora= The park is estimated to contain about 800 species of flora, and is home to 80% of all flora found in central Kazakhstan. Of the 800 or so species that exist within the park, 244 are listed in Kazakhstan's Red Book, including the Kyrgyz birch (Betula kirghisorum SAV.-RYCZG), the smooth sphagnum (Sphagnum teres (Schimp.) Angstr.), thin poppy (Papaver tenellum), spring pheasant's eye (Adonis vernalis L.), and the Karkaraly barberry (Berberis karkaralensis Kornilova et Potapov). Forest in the Kent Mountains The forests within the park are made up of pine, birch, aspen, and willow trees. 71.3% of the wooded area in the park are pine trees. Birch forest occupies 10% of the wooded area and aspen forest take up 2%. The underbrush of the park includes Cossack's juniper, Tatar's honeysuckle, and other plants. Shrubs occupy 34% of the total area of the park. There are 87 kinds of medicinal, oil bearing and alkaloid plants in the Karkaraly Mountains. Because of drought and high winds, 2,525 hectares of the Karkaraly forest were burned by forest fires in 1997–1998. After the fire, the park worked very hard on planting new trees and restoring the forest to its original state. A nursery in the Kent mountains provided the saplings for the re-vegetation project. Fire prevention standards were implemented and the following year 164 hectares were destroyed from 18 separate fires. In 2003, 84 hectares were burned.

It was screened in the UK on BBC Two from 11 May to 5 June 2008. The English narration was provided by Bernard Hill and the series produced by Phil Chapman for the BBC and Gao Xiaoping for CCTV. The Chinese version was broadcast under the title Beautiful China. In Canada, it was broadcast on CBC as part of the series The Nature Of Things narrated by David Suzuki. Wild China was broadcast in Australia on ABC1 and ABC HD each Sunday at 7:30pm from 18 May 2008. The musical score to accompany the series was composed by Barnaby Taylor and was performed by Cheng Yu and the UK Chinese Ensemble. The series was billed as the culmination of the BBC Natural History Unit's \\"Continents\\" programmes, a long-running strand of blue-chip wildlife documentaries which surveyed the natural history of each of the world's major land areas. It was preceded by Wild Caribbean in 2007, but with the broadcast of South Pacific in 2009 the BBC signalled a continuation of the strand.  Production details  The 2008 Beijing Olympics gave the BBC Natural History Unit team the opportunity to make the first comprehensive series on China's natural history. In the run up to the Games, the Chinese government was \\"understandably keen to promote itself as a country worth visiting\\" according to BBC producer Phil Chapman. Permission for Wild China was granted in 2005, with the BBC working alongside local partners CTV, a Beijing production company closely allied to state broadcaster CCTV. The series marks the first time that CCTV has collaborated with a foreign broadcaster. With wildlife filmmaking in its infancy in China, and a perception in the developed world of a country plagued by environmental problems, the producers hoped that the series would change attitudes in both the East and the West: Filming for the series took place over 16 months, and involved half a million miles of travel on 57 separate filming trips to some of China's most inaccessible and spectacular locations. The production team shot over 500 hours of HD footage in 26 of China's 30 provinces. Despite being granted unprecedented access to many remote and protected areas, one of the main challenges faced by the filmmakers was finding wildlife. Although 15% of China's territory has some form of protection, this is not a guarantee of safety for wildlife, as reserves were often found to be under-equipped and under-staffed. In addition, they encountered a lack of local expertise and specialist knowledge, as few of China's zoologists were naturalists with an interest in observing wildlife. Producers even struggled to film the courting behaviour of one of the country's commonest creatures, the rice-paddy frog. Consequently, the team's attempts to find and film wildlife were not always successful. With the support of local party officials, the producers found it easier to contact and film local people. They were particularly keen to record examples of traditional lifestyles which incorporate the natural world to give the series a cultural context. The episodes were divided by region to present the distinct cultural as well as ecological differences.  Filming techniques  Over 80% of the series was based on traditional observational techniques in the wild. These were conducted in some of China's most remote areas: * Apart from a handful of biologists, the Wild China team were the first to set foot in Tibet’s remote Chang Tang reserve for almost 100 years. After a five-day drive from Lhasa, they were faced with the challenge of filming rutting chiru in temperatures of -30°C at 5,000m above sea level. The sequence showing a duel between two rival males was successfully filmed after stalking the herds for seven days. Field producer Jeff Boedeker trained with his team for a month in various stealth techniques. On one occasion the field team lay under a white tarp for 32 hours waiting for a shot that never came. They burned yak dung to stay warm and melt drinking water, and the crew was specifically selected for its sensibility to cultures, mental and physical aptitude for high stress scenarios, and techniques in nonfiction filmmaking. * After two unsuccessful attempts to film wild giant pandas in the Qinling Mountains, the producers switched to a different part of the region, the little-visited Changqing Reserve. There they were able to track and film the creatures in winter, and also film courtship and mating activity, the first time such a complete sequence has been shot in the wild. * Producer Kathryn Jeffs and cameraman Paul Stewart travelled to the remote Gaoligongshan mountains in western Yunnan and after a three-hour trek to a ridge overlooking the forest, managed to film a troop of bear macaques feeding on fruits in the canopy. A second sequence showing white-eared pheasants at a rarely seen lek was ruined when the birds were disturbed. Francois' langurs were filmed taking refuge in a cave Certain sequences could only be filmed using special techniques: * High speed cameras were used to slow down the action 80 times to show a songbird evading the lunge of a Pallas' pit viper on Shedao Island. * A time-lapse sequence of a remote Tibetan gorge was filmed using still images taken at intervals after the main filming camera broke down. * Infrared lighting enabled the team to film Francois langurs and bamboo bats covertly. * Thermal imaging cameras were used to show how the elephant yam uses convection heating at night to distribute its distinctive smell, which attracts pollinating beetles. In some circumstances behaviour was too difficult to obtain in the wild, and controlled conditions were required: * Bamboo rats and Roborovski hamsters were filmed in burrows with glass side panels in a studio set. * The producers negotiated an agreement to take Chinese alligator eggs from an incubator at the Xuancheng breeding centre and place them in an artificial nest to film them hatching. * The courtship display of Temminck's tragopans was filmed using a captive pair of birds habituated to the presence of humans. Hunting pressure has made the wild birds in Yunnan too wary to approach. * The slowed-down images of jumping spiders on Everest could not be filmed in the wild due to the impracticality of transporting high-speed camera equipment to the remote location, so a closely related species was filmed in a studio set.  Episodes  Merchandise  A Blu-ray Disc, DVD and book have been released to accompany the TV series: * The Blu-ray Disc (BBCBD0025), released on 5 August 2008, presents the series in full high-definition format. The series is also included in the BBC High Definition Natural History Collection Blu-ray box sets for Regions A and B (BBCBD0056). * A Region 2, 2-disc DVD set (BBCDVD2146) featuring all six full-length episodes was released on 9 June 2008.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the allosterically regulated rate-limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Each isozyme is a heterotetramer that is composed of two alpha subunits, one beta subunit, and one gamma subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is the beta subunit of one isozyme of NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]  Structure  IDH3 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes, the other two being IDH1 and IDH2, and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which are IDH1, IDH2, IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G. The genes IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G encode subunits of IDH3, which is a heterotetramer composed of two 37-kDa α subunits (IDH3α), one 39-kDa β subunit (IDH3β), and one 39-kDa γ subunit (IDH3γ), each with distinct isoelectric points. Alignment of their amino acid sequences reveals ~40% identity between IDH3α and IDH3β, ~42% identity between IDH3α and IDH3γ, and an even closer identity of 53% between IDH3β and IDH3γ, for an overall 34% identity and 23% similarity across all three subunit types. Notably, Arg88 in IDH3α is essential for IDH3 catalytic activity, whereas the equivalent Arg99 in IDH3β and Arg97 in IDH3γ are largely involved in the enzyme's allosteric regulation by ADP and NAD. Thus, it is possible that these subunits arose from gene duplication of a common ancestral gene, and the original catalytic Arg residue were adapted to allosteric functions in the β- and γ-subunits. Likewise, Asp181 in IDH3α is essential for catalysis, while the equivalent Asp192 in IDH3β and Asp190 in IDH3γ enhance NAD- and Mn2+-binding. Since the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by IDH3 requires binding of NAD, Mn2+, and the substrate isocitrate, all three subunits participate in the catalytic reaction. Moreover, studies of the enzyme in pig heart reveal that the αβ and αγ dimers constitute two binding sites for each of its ligands, including isocitrate, Mn2+, and NAD, in one IDH3 tetramer. = Isoforms = The IDH3B gene contains 12 exons and encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms: IDH3β1 (349 residues) and IDH3β2 (354 residues). These isoforms are tissue-specific and possess optimal pHs matching those of their target tissues. IDH3β1, with an optimal pH of 8.0, is expressed in brain and kidney, whereas IDH3β2, with an optimal pH of 7.6, is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.  Function  As an isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH3 catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and CO2 as part of the TCA cycle in glucose metabolism. This step also allows for the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which is then used to generate ATP through the electron transport chain. Notably, IDH3 relies on NAD+ as its electron acceptor, as opposed to NADP+ like IDH1 and IDH2. IDH3 activity is regulated by the energy needs of the cell: when the cell requires energy, IDH3 is activated by ADP; and when energy is no longer required, IDH3 is inhibited by ATP and NADH. This allosteric regulation allows IDH3 to function as a rate-limiting step in the TCA cycle. Within cells, IDH3 and its subunits have been observed to localize to the mitochondria.  Clinical Significance  Homozygous loss-of-function mutations of the IDH3B gene has been linked to retinitis pigmentosa, the neurodegeneration of rods and cones in the retina resulting in blindness.

Directionless and unable to garner any sort of initiative or ambition, Grant is in the midst of an identity crisis and has done nothing for months, paying the rent from his savings while Johnna pays the other bills with her salary. Perhaps intentionally, Johnna leaves a patient's artwork for Grant to find. He finds the images in the drawings powerful, compelling, transcendent and immediately determines he must meet the artist. Johnna indignantly refuses to cooperate, claiming therapist-patient confidentiality. Immediately resorting to subterfuge, Grant discovers Robin, 28, the creator of the artwork and a schizophrenic, recently released from the hospital to a halfway house and attending Johnna's weekly therapy sessions. To Johnna's mounting fury and dismay, Grant cultivates a friendship with Robin, and she finally leaves when Robin moves into the apartment with Grant. The two men have a strange symbiotic friendship, with Robin as a guru-like figure producing his drawings for Grant, who finds they bring a whole new meaning to his life, and Grant taking care of the increasingly vulnerable Robin's emotional and physical needs. Slow at first, then rapid changes in Robin's metaemotional condition are catalyzed when a mentally ill young woman is introduced into the mix and all the instability culminates when Robin (to Grant's eyes anyway) transcends the physical and becomes a being of light shortly before his body dies of heart failure en route to the emergency room.

The station opened in May 1928 with two side platforms outside the two Rockaway Beach Branch tracks that bracketed the four-track Main Line, so only Rockaway trains stopped there. After the Rockaway Trestle fire in 1950, the line was closed station by station. The station closed on June 8, 1962, one day before the Rockaway Beach Branch was abandoned. Nothing remains at the site today. Station layout The station, located on the west side of 63rd Drive, had two high-level side platforms, located at the north and south ends of the six-track Main Line right-of-way. The platforms only served the Rockaway Beach Branch, which used the outer two tracks. The platforms were constructed of wood with concrete bases, and featuring shelters along the platform. A single staircase from the east end of each platform went down to 63rd Drive, and an additional staircase was located at 63rd Avenue (formerly Marion Avenue) from the northbound platform. The 63rd Drive entrance also featured a ticket office and heated waiting room, with restrooms. History Prior to the construction of the Rego Park station, two former stations near Whitepot Junction were named Matawok, and were located on both the Main Line and Rockaway Beach Branch. Both stations were named for the Matawok Land Company, which built the neighborhood surrounding the junction known at the time as \\"Forest Hills West.\\" =Matawok Rockaway Beach Line station= The first station to be given the name Matawok, near the junction at Rego Park, was located along the Rockaway Beach Branch at Fleet Street on the northeast corner of a bridge over the street. It was opened between 1910 and 1913, although LIRR records of the station show its existence dating back to 1908 and into 1915. Some maps show the station existing as recently as 1922.The First Matawok Station (Arrt's Arrchives) =Matawok Main Line station= The other Matawok Station was located along the main line east of Whitepot Junction at 66th Avenue. It was opened on June 25, 1922, and had two platforms along four tracks, and a pedestrian bridge not only over the main line, but also over the Rockaway Beach Branch leading from 64th Road east of Alderton Street. The station closed on May 21, 1925, but the remnants of the station remained for decades.The Second Matawok Station (Arrt's Arrchives) =Parkside station= In 1927, calls came from the Rego Park community for a new LIRR station at 63rd Drive (originally Penelope Street). This was contrary to the desires of the railroad, who wished to cease further expansion of Queens operations. Construction on the new Rego Park station began on January 30, 1928. The station was a modernized version of the design used at the Parkside station. Initially planned to open on April 1, the station was completed in April, and opened on May 23, 1928. Two parades were held in Rego Park on May 26 to commemorate the opening of the station. The Rockaway Beach Branch closed on June 8, 1962.

Family Leonhard was born at Bruck Castle in Lienz, the comital residence of the House of Gorizia. He was the son of Henry VI, Count of Gorizia, and his wife, Catherine, a daughter of the Hungarian palatine Nicholas II Garay. In 1454 he succeeded his father, who left him an almost ruined county with two separate territories.  Early reign  Leonhard at first ruled jointly with his brothers John II and Louis. John as the eldest apparently held most of the power while younger Louis did not exercise any political role and died between 1456 and 1457. The brothers had to face the hostility of Emperor Frederick III who aimed to seize their remaining \\"outer county\\" around the town of Lienz and the Puster Valley, separating the Habsburg hereditary lands of Tyrol and Carinthia, which had been possessions of the Meinhardiner dynasty until the 14th century. Moreover, John and Leonhard picked a fierce inheritance conflict around the lands of the extinct counts of Celje after the death of Count Ulrich II in 1456, whereupon the defeated brothers not only had to renounce all their claims but also were forced to cede the residence at Lienz and various territories in Carinthia to Frederick III. The Counts of Görz had to move to Heinfels Castle. John died in 1462 and Leonhard became sole ruler. With the help of his capable deputy Virgil von Graben, a relative from the House of Graben von Stein, he recovered Lienz. Leonhard married, in 1478, Paola Gonzaga, the daughter of the Italian marquis Ludovico III of Mantua, but the union proved childless, as was his first marriage to Hieronyma of Ilok, the daughter of Nicholas of Ilok, King of Bosnia.  Succession  Facing the extinction of the dynasty, sickly Count Leonhard became subject to the competing pressures of both the Imperial Habsburg dynasty and the Republic of Venice, which both competed for his heritage. The Venice Ten, who since 1434 ruled over the Domini di Terraferma in Friuli, intended to seize the adjacent \\"inner county\\" centered on the town of Gorizia itself. In the end Leonhard leaned towards the Habsburgs and signed an inheritance treaty with Frederick's son Emperor Maximilian I. Upon his death, Austrian troops immediately occupied the town of Gorizia. The Habsburgs (re-)united Lienz with the County of Tyrol and went on to rule as Counts in Gorizia (Gorizia and Gradisca from 1754). Leonhard's former deputy Virgil von Graben, who had played a vital role in the convergence to the Habsburg dynasty, took the position as a Stadtholder in Lienz from them.

Carlson also worked as an ink artist in the Walt Disney Animation Studios, on such films as Cinderella, Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty. She was the lead ink artist for the 1955 Disney film Lady and the Tramp. She spent 56 years working on Disney's animated films and theme park attractions. Early life Joyce Carlson was born in Racine, Wisconsin on March 16, 1923. Her family moved to Southern California in 1938 when she was a teenager. Carlson graduated from Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California. She initially did not want to become a designer. After high school she took a job delivering pens, pencils, paints and brushes to animators at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. She soon became an inker after that. When the inkers were replaced by Xerox, she moved into the imagineering group at Walt Disney. Career Carlson first became involved with Walt Disney Productions in Burbank, California in 1944, when she took a job in the traffic department delivering mail, art supplies, coffee and other necessities to various departments. She later stated that she took the job at Disney simply because she needed the work. Carlson created a pen-and-ink portfolio of her sketches several months after she began working at Disney, and presented it to her employers. She was hired into a position in the Disney studio's ink and paint department. This particular department was nicknamed \\"the nunnery\\" at the time because many of its employees were women who sometimes worked 16-hour days in order to finish Disney's feature films on time. Her first work was on short, Disney-produced training films made for the United States Army during World War II. However, Carlson was soon promoted to feature films, which she worked on for 16 years. Her credits included The Three Caballeros, Cinderella, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty. She was further promoted to lead ink artist during the production of the 1955 animated feature film Lady and the Tramp. By 1960 the technology used in animation had changed, which meant that ink artists were no longer needed in the animation process. In 1962, Carlson joined WED Enterprises, named after Walt Elias Disney, to work on three dimensional characters in Walt Disney's theme parks. WED later became known as Walt Disney Imagineering. (The first Disney theme park, Disneyland, had opened in 1955). Her mentors in the imagineering group were Mary Blair and Marc Davis. One of her earliest projects was the Carousel of Progress where she worked with Leota \\"Lee\\" Toombs, who was later the model for Madame Leota in The Haunted Mansion. For the show models, Toombs and Carlson were given chewing gum, wires, and earrings to make hinges for the refrigerator and various household appliances. Due to their lack of supplies, secretaries started to bring in bags of their old jewelry. Walt Disney would used to show guests new developments in their projects and he'd say, \\"Do you believe that this whole set was built on earrings?\\" The Carousel of Progress debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair as well as Carlson's next project, \\"It's a Small World\\". Carlson helped to create the original models and designs for the \\"It's a Small World\\" attraction, which debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair. She was one of a select group of artists and designers who were sent to New York City by Disney in order to create attractions for the World's Fair. Within the Disney Company, she became known as the artist who designed many of the famous ride's singing dolls. Following its debut at the World's Fair, \\"It's a Small World\\" opened first in Disneyland; Carlson later helped bring her signature attraction to Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris . Following her time working on projects for the World's Fair, Joyce Carlson worked on a team with Leota Toombs, Harriet Burns, and Glendra von Kessel to create many of the models and final pieces of attractions such as Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Country Bear Jamboree and many others. Additionally, she worked as a costume designer for raccoons, chickens, geese, dogs, etc. on a show called America Sings. The characters were later appropriated for scenes in Magic Kingdom's Splash Mountain attraction. She continued to work on newer attractions at Disneyland, Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Resort Paris. She was mentored by Disney's first generation of attractions designers, notably Grace Bailey, Mary Blair and John Hench. In the later years of her career, Joyce moved to Florida in 1982, where she served as the resident “It’s a Small World” expert (even developing new dolls for the attraction, including those representing Israel and Korea), helped maintain audio-animatronics figures and even helping Disney Legend John Hench select the color palette for the Park’s iconic carousel horses. Additionally, she supervised the installation of The Haunted Mansion in the Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. She became the first female Disney employee to reach the 50 and 55 years of employment milestone in 1994. She was working at Walt Disney World as a senior show production designer at the time. Carlson officially retired from her full-time position at Disney in 2000, but remained at Disney World part-time until at least 2006 and continued to mentor Disney Imagineers through 2007. She was declared a \\"Disney Legend\\" in 2000 and honored with a window on Main Street, U.S.A. at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. The commemorative window, which is Disney's version of a hall of fame, is a rare honor bestowed on employees who have made significant contributions to the company and its theme parks. Carlson's window, which is on the second floor of a structure along Main Street U.S.A, reads, “Dolls by Miss Joyce. Dollmaker for the World. Shops in New York, California, Florida, Japan and Paris. Owner and Founder Joyce Carlson.” Another tribute was made in her honor when imagineers created a Joyce Carlson doll that is featured in the Florida attraction. Death Joyce Carlson died of cancer at the age of 84 at her home in Orlando, Florida on January 2, 2008. She was survived by her sister, Veryl Jones. Her husband predeceased her.

The novel, set in Miami, Florida, focuses on the subject of Cuban immigrants there.  Background  Wolfe's 1998 novel A Man in Full, about a real-estate mogul in Atlanta during that city's economic boom of the 1990s, was a considerable success. An estimated 1.4 million copies of the book were sold in hardcover alone. Wolfe followed A Man in Full with 2004's I Am Charlotte Simmons, the story of a sheltered teenage girl attending a fictitious prestigious university where she is forced to navigate the world of undergraduate athletics, emerging sexuality, and academic integrity. The book was considered disappointing by many critics, and sales were much lower: Nielsen BookScan placed hardback sales at 293,000 copies and paperback sales at 138,000.Rich, Motoko. \\"Tom Wolfe Leaves Longtime Publisher, Taking His New Book\\", The New York Times, January 3, 2008.

But after the relatively disappointing sales of I Am Charlotte Simmons, Wolfe was unable to agree on terms for the new novel with his publisher of 42 years. The Associated Press reported that Wolfe had been offered a reduced advance for Back to Blood.Italie, Hillel. \\"Tom Wolfe switches publishers for his new novel, 'Back to Blood'\\", Associated Press via Maclean's, January 2, 2008. Retrieved on January 3, 2008. An excerpt from the novel was shown to several publishers; Wolfe sold the rights to publish his novel to Little, Brown for a sum of close to US$7 million, according to The New York Times, in an auction that ended shortly before Christmas of 2007. Content Even before the novel was finished, some details were reported in the media. The novel has been described as Wolfe's take on \\"class, family, wealth, race, crime, sex, corruption and ambition in Miami, the city where America's future has arrived first.\\" Racial anxieties were a key source of tension in The Bonfire of the Vanities—Back to Blood will similarly feature characters of Cuban, Haitian, Russian, and French ancestry in the melting pot of Miami. Of the subject matter, Wolfe said, \\"Two years ago when I got the idea of doing a book on immigration, people would say, 'Oh, that’s fascinating,' and then they would go to sleep standing up like a horse. Since then the subject has become a little more exciting, and in Miami, it's not only exciting, it’s red hot.\\" Wolfe, who is well known for the depth of reporting that goes into his novels, has generated buzz for the novel through his extensive reporting, The Wall Street Journal reported that Miami retailers anticipated strong sales for the novel. Release and reception The book was released on October 23, 2012 to mixed reviews. The book debuted at #4 on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller List on November 11, 2012. It remained on the list for three weeks. Back to Blood was an even bigger commercial failure than I Am Charlotte Simmons, selling 62,000 copies as of February 2013, according to Bookscan.

The NDUFS7 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) also known as Complex I, which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain.  Structure  The NDUFS7 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 in position 13.3. The NDUFS7 gene produces a 25 kDa protein composed of 238 amino acids. The PSST subunit is highly conserved across evolutionary distances. Crystal structures and mutational studies indicate that it is one of the ubiquinone binding sites of Complex I, together with the TYKY (NDUFS8) subunit. It has been proposed that PSST, along with TYKY, 49 kDa, ND1 and ND5 subunits interact with iron-sulfur clusters as part of the catalytic core of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone).  Function  The PSST subunit encoded by the NDUSF7 gene is one of over 40 subunits involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Specifically, it is thought that the PSST subunit directly couples electron transfer between the iron- sulfur cluster N2 and ubiquinone, along with ubiquinone-binding ND1. Functional evidence for the importance of PSST has been garnered from mutational studies in the obligate aerobic yeast, Yarrow lipolytic, which elucidated a central role in proton translocation that was reduced in mutant forms of the subunit.  Clinical Significance  Mitochondrial complex I deficiency (MT-C1D) is caused by mutations affecting the NDUFS7 gene. Complex I deficiency is a disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson's disease. Leigh syndrome is an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions in one or more areas of the central nervous system including the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and spinal cord, and is the most common mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Clinical features depend on which areas of the central nervous system are involved and include subacute onset of psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, weakness, vision loss, eye movement abnormalities, seizures, dysphagia, and lactic acidosis.  Interactions  In addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFS7 has protein- protein interactions with ENO2 and ARRB2.

The NDUFA5 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Structure The NDUFA5 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 7 and it spans 64,655 base pairs. The gene produces a 13.5 kDa protein composed of 116 amino acids. NDUFA5 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDUFA5 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. The protein localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of the 7 component-containing, water-soluble iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction of complex I, although its specific role is unknown. It is assumed to undergo post-translational removal of the initiator methionine and N-acetylation of the next amino acid. The predicted secondary structure is primarily alpha helix, but the carboxy-terminal half of the protein has high potential to adopt a coiled-coil form. The amino-terminal part contains a putative beta sheet rich in hydrophobic amino acids that may serve as mitochondrial import signal. Related pseudogenes have also been identified on four other chromosomes. Function The human NDUFA5 gene codes for the B13 subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. The NDUFA5 protein localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and it is thought to aid in this transfer of electrons. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix. The high degree of conservation of NDUFA5 extending to plants and fungi indicates its functional significance in the enzyme complex. Clinical significance NDUFA5, ATP5A1 and ATP5A1 all show consistently reduced expression in brains of autism patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ATP synthesis can result in oxidative stress, which may play a role in the development of autism. Interactions NDUFA5 has many protein-protein interactions, such as ubiquitin C and with members of the NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex, including NDUFB1, NDUFB9 and NDUFB10.

It serves the Newburyport/Rockport Line, and is only open to General Electric Aviation employees who work at the River Works plant. Trains only stop at River Works on weekdays. It is served by inbound trains in the morning and outbound trains in the evening for commuting plant workers, as well as trains in the opposite directions for reverse commuting workers. River Works station is proposed to be opened to the public, made accessible, and renamed to Lynnport as part of plans for a development on adjacent land. In May 2017, the developer reached an agreement with MassDOT, although financing had not yet been secured. History Aerial view of part of the River Works property in July 2016 with the station at bottom center The station opened as G.E. Works on September 9, 1965, to serve workers of the plant, which had opened early in the century and been substantially expanded during World War II. The name was changed to River Works in the late 1970s. It did not appear on maps until the MBTA bought the northside commuter lines in 1976, and was listed only as a footnote on public timetables until January 1989. River Works station has two bare concrete platforms with bus shelters to serve the line's two tracks; it is not handicapped accessible. The River Works plant formerly shipped large products like electrical transformers by rail; the two-track main line was flanked with running tracks which connected sidings serving the plant. The platforms are located on the outside of these former tracks; making the station accessible would require building platforms which would preclude future freight rail access. =Proposed changes= The land east of the station was formerly home to General Electric's Gear Plant, which closed in 2011. Four years prior to the closure, the city upzoned the site to allow buildings up to 20 stories high in hopes of attracting new commercial development. In July 2014, a developer reached an agreement with GE to buy of the site. The developer, Charles Patsios, indicated that he planned to leave an easement for public access to the station. Patsios bought the site in October 2014 and opened discussions with MBTA officials about opening River Works station for public use. GE granted the required easement after Patsios purchased the property. He intended to finalize plans for the station—which he planned to rename as Lynnport—by the end of 2015, pending the resolution of several potential blockers. To open the station to the public, it would have to be made handicapped accessible, with high-level platforms constructed and the tracks relocated. The state is hesitant to pay for such upgrades without proven ridership. Additionally, GE would require security considerations before approving the public opening. The station was in 2016 proposed to be opened only to residents of the planned development, rather than to the public at large. However, under a tentative agreement that the developer reached with MassDOT in February 2017, the rebuilt station would be open to all riders. The full agreement was signed in May 2017, although the development project had not been financed. Under the agreement, the developer will pay for new platforms, 80 parking spaces, and a bus station. Lynn and River Works stations were changed from fare Zone 2 to Zone 1A (allowing subway-fare rides to Boston) from May 22–31 and July 1–December 31, 2020 to provide additional travel options during the COVID-19 pandemic (as many of the 400-series bus routes were reduced in frequency) and to examine the impact of temporary fare changes.

Function  Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is an intracellular protein that was identified as a cytosolic 25-hydroxycholesterol-binding protein. OSBP is a lipid transfer protein that controls cholesterol/PI4P exchange at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites. 25-hydroxycholesterol acts as a natural inhibitor of this exchange. OSBP regulates ER-Golgi membrane contact sites formation by bridging ER and Golgi membranes together. OSBP plays also a role as a sterol-regulated scaffolding protein for several cytosolic reactions including the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. It has been shown that expression and maturation of SREBP-1c is controlled by OSBP. SREBP-1c is a major transcription factor for hepatic lipogenesis (fatty acids and triglycerides biosynthesis). OSBP expression levels in transgenic mice affect liver and serum TG levels. OSBP is thought to be an essential scaffolding compound of the protein complex that regulates the activation state of the ERK protein. OSBP also acts as a sterol-dependant scaffold for the JAK2 and STAT3 proteins.  Mechanism of action  OSBP is a multi-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central FFAT motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic track), and a C-terminal lipid transport domain (ORD). The PH domain binds the trans-Golgi membrane by contacting the lipid PI4P and the activated small G protein Arf1(-GTP), whereas the FFAT motif binds the type II ER membrane protein VAP-A. OSBP bridges the Golgi and the ER by establishing contacts with all of these determinants simultaneously. OSBP is thought to transport cholesterol from the ER to the Golgi, and to transport the phosphoinositide PI4P backward (from the Golgi to the ER). Then, PI4P can be hydrolyzed by the phosphatidylinositide phosphatase SAC1, which is an ER- resident protein. Therefore, OSBP acts as a negative regulator of its own attachment to the trans-Golgi (which requires the binding of its PH domain to PI4P). This negative feedback system might coordinate cholesterol transport out of the ER to PI4P level in the Golgi.  Regulation  OSBP is regulated by PKD mediated phosphorylation, and by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), a high-affinity ligand for OSBP (~30 nM). Several proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis, such as INSIG-1 or ACAT, also bind 25-OH. In fact 25-OH is a potent suppressor of sterol synthesis in cultured cells and accelerates cholesterol esterification. In cellular studies it has been shown that OSBP, initially cytosolic, relocates to ER-Golgi membrane contact sites in the presence of 25-OH. 25-OH acts as an inhibitor of sterol transport mediated by OSBP in vitro.  Isoforms  OSBP is the founding member of the ORP (OSBP-related proteins) family of lipid transfer proteins. Mammals have 16 different ORPs, whereas the yeast S. cerevisiae genome encodes seven ORP homologues (Osh). ORP and Osh proteins contain a lipid transport domain called ORD (OSBP-related domain) encompassing the EQVSHHPP signature sequence. The ORD structure consists in a hydrophobic pocket. Because the EQVSHHPP sequence is crucial for PI4P binding to the ORD, but not for sterol binding, it has been proposed that PI4P transport is a common function of Osh/ORP proteins.

It is also known as succinyl-CoA-3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT). Mutations in this gene are associated with succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase deficiency.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase gene family. The encoded protein is a homodimeric mitochondrial matrix enzyme that plays a central role in extrahepatic ketone body catabolism by catalyzing the reversible transfer of coenzyme A (CoA) from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate. Structure= Gene = The OXCT1 gene resides on chromosome 5 at the band 5p13. OXCT1 spans a length of over 100 kb and includes 17 exons. = Protein = The crystal structure of human OXCT1 reveals it to be a homodimer with two active sites. Each of its monomers contains N- and C-terminal domains that share an α/β structural fold characteristic of CoA transferase family I members. These terminal domains are joined by a linker region and form the enzyme's active site. Specifically, the conserved residue Glu344 within the active site is responsible for the enzyme's catalytic function by attacking the succinyl-CoA substrate, leading to the formation of the enzyme-CoA thioester intermediate.  Function  OXCT1 is a member of the CoA transferase family I, which is known to catalyze the transfer of CoA between carboxylic acid groups. In particular, OXCT1 catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in ketolysis by transferring the CoA from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate, giving acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA). The product AcAc-CoA can then be converted by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase into acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle to generate energy for the cell. As a result, OXCT1 allows cells to utilize energy stored in ketone bodies synthesized by the liver during conditions of energy deficiency, such as low glucose levels. In addition, OXCT1 activity leads to the formation of Acetyl-CoA, which serves as a precursor for short-chain acyl-CoAs and lipids in the cytosol. OXCT1 is found in the mitochondrial matrix of all tissues except the liver, though it is most abundantly expressed in heart, brain, and kidney tissue. Considering that liver cells function in ketogenesis and OXCT1 in ketolysis, OXCT1 may be absent from the liver to allow ketone body formation to proceed. Clinical Significance= Metabolic disorders = SCOT deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that can lead to recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis and even permanent ketosis. Twenty-four mutations in the human OXCT1 gene have been identified and associated with SCOT deficiency: three nonsense mutations, two insertion mutations, and 19 missense mutations. These mutations alter OXCT1 form and thus function in various ways, and they determine what phenotypic complications a patient may present. For instance, several missense mutations that substitute bulkier or charged residues hinder proper folding of OXCT1, leading to more severe outcomes such as permanent acidosis. OXCT1 has also been implicated diabetes. In a study by MacDonald et al., OXCT1 activity was shown to be lower by 92% in pancreatic islets of human patients with type 2 diabetes compared to those in healthy patients, though the cause is currently unknown. = Cancer = Since OXCT1 functions in metabolizing ketone bodies, it has been proposed to promote tumor growth by providing tumor cells with an additional energy source. Therefore, ketone inhibitors may prove effective in treating patients experiencing recurring and metastatic tumors. A proteomics study identified OXCT1 to be one of 16 proteins upregulated in carcinoma HepG2 cells treated with Platycodin D, an anti-cancer agent.

Other bishops were: Asterius, who went to Constantinople with Pope Agapitus in 534; St Gaudiosus (eighth century); Petrus (834), formerly Bishop of Canusio, who took refuge at Salerno when the Saracens destroyed his capital, and built the Church of San Giovanni Battista; Bernardus (850), who restored several buildings. In the eighth century the city of Salerno was in the power of the Lombard dukes of Benevento. In 984 Salerno became an archiepiscopal see, the first archbishop being Amato. Other archbishops were: *San Alfano (1058–85), who received the exiled Pope Gregory VII *Romualdo I (1121) *Romualdo II Guarna (1153) *Nicolo Agello (1181) *Caesarius of Alagno (1225–63) *Guglielmo de' Godoni (1298), chancellor of the Duke of Calabria, whose successors, to Orso Minutolo (1330), resided at Avignon *Barnaba Orsini (1441), who restored the cathedral *Pietro Guglielmo Rocca (d. 1482) *Giovanni Vera (1500), later a cardinal, who was sent on several pontifical legations to France and to England *Girolamo Seripando (1554), theologian and former general of the Augustinians, whose doctrines on justification, akin to those of Luther, were rejected at the Council of Trent, and who afterwards became a cardinal *Gaspar Cervantes de Gaeta (1564), who founded the seminary *Marc Antonio Colonna (1568), who established another college for clerics *his nephew, Marc Antonio Colonna (1574), the author *Mario Bolognini (1591), who distinguished himself in France in the controversies with the Huguenots; *Giovanni de Torres (1658), who reformed the lives of the clergy; *Gregorio Caraffa (1664), a Theatine and reformer; *Antonio Salomone, who, after the annexation of the kingdom of Naples, was imprisoned without reason (1886), and at the beginning of the war with Austria was sent into exile.

It is just outside the city walls of York.  Origin of the name  York historian Francis Drake suggested in his Eboracum (1736) that the first part of the name referred to a resting-place (or \\"lair\\") used by deer on the edge of the Forest of Galtres. The second part (\\"thorpe\\") is a placename suffix used within the Danelaw for small settlements adjacent to larger ones. The earliest known reference (in a charter of 1184–9) calls the village \\"Leirthorp\\".  History  Foss Islands chimney, Layerthorpe Layerthorpe Bridge underpass After William the Conqueror created a dam in the River Foss in 1069 to create a moat around York Castle, the river flooded in the Layerthorpe area, forming a large lake that would become known as the \\"King's Pool\\" (or \\"King's Fishpool\\"). The King's Pool became an integral part of the city's defences during the Middle Ages – this explains the absence of defensive wall in the area today – and was well known for its abundance of fish. The fourteenth-century Layerthorpe Bridge, a crossing of the Foss, adjacent to the King's Pool, was once attached to a postern in the city wall, known as Layerthorpe Postern. In 1829, the bridge was rebuilt, and the Postern and a short section of wall were demolished. In 1926, the bridge was widened again, and in the 1990s it was completely rebuilt on a different alignment. Layerthorpe bridge led to the village of Layerthorpe on the road, now called Layerthorpe, which runs from York to the suburb of Heworth. There was a medieval church (St. Mary's, Layerthorpe), which was built about fifty yards from the bridge in the fourteenth century or earlier. The church was closed in 1549, and the parish was united with that of St. Cuthbert's, Peasholme Green, in 1586. The church has disappeared, although its foundations were temporarily uncovered in 1920. Meanwhile, the King's Pool declined, as silt from upriver collected and there was not enough water coming down to move it on. In the eighteenth century, the waters were so low that marshy islands had begun to appear, giving the area the additional name of Foss Islands, and during the summer months the river smelled foul and was mostly dry and stagnant. At the end of the eighteenth century, the Foss was canalised and the Pool disappeared. In 1854, the area was drained and Foss Islands Road (now part of the York Inner Ring Road) was constructed between Layerthorpe Bridge and Walmgate Bar. In 1824, the York Gas Light Company began production on a site between Layerthorpe and Monkgate. This was expanded in 1885, and a siding from the Foss Islands Branch Line was constructed to serve it. The Branch Line had been opened in 1880 to serve the cattle-market at Walmgate Bar and to provide facilities for freight traffic, including deliveries of coal and, later, sand for bottle-making, on the eastern side of the city. On Foss Islands Road, just south of Layerthorpe Bridge, York Corporation built a power station and refuse destructor in the 1890s, again with sidings off the Branch Line. York (Layerthorpe) railway station, the northern terminus of the Derwent Valley Light Railway (DVLR) which connected with the Foss Islands Branch, opened in 1913. It was located on Hallfield Road.  Layerthorpe today  Travelodge Layerthorpe Storage Facility All the railway lines in the Layerthorpe area had been closed by 1989, and the route of the DVLR and part of the Branch Line is now a footpath and cycle-path. The Branch Line's sidings and the Corporation's premises have been replaced by a variety of industrial and retail units (and increasingly, residential), although the refuse destructor's octagonal chimney (a Grade II listed building, approximately 55 metres high) has been preserved next to Morrisons supermarket on Foss Islands Road. No trace of the railway station remains, and Hallfield Road, a through-route to the A1079 since 2007, contains much recent housing. New buildings are also beginning to appear on the gasworks site.

In addition a number of stand-alone courses are offered to part-time students for personal development or leisure. History The former Lanchester Building (1938) The Watford Library and School of Science and Art began in 1874 on Queens Road, Watford. A new building on Hempstead Road for the college was designed by the architects Henry Vaughan Lanchester and Thomas Arthur Lodge and construction of the large, Art Deco-style college, known as the Lanchester Building, began in 1938. The new college was located on former lands of the Cassiobury Estate, sold by the Earl of Essex. Although the stately home was demolished in 1927, the 17th-century dower house, Little Cassiobury, remained. Progress on the new building was interrupted by the advent of World War II and the building remained unfinished throughout the 1940s. Watford Technical College was founded in 1947 but it was not until 1953 that Watford Technical College was officially opened in its new premises. In the 1980s Watford College of Technology merged with the George Stephenson College (built 1965/66)The Buildings of England, Hertfordshire, 2nd edition page 388 to form Watford College. West Herts College was established in 1991 as part of the reorganisation of Further Education in Hertfordshire. It was created from the two local colleges Watford College and Cassio College, and Dacorum College in Hemel Hempstead. A new Watford Campus building was constructed in the early 21st century and West Herts College vacated the Lanchester Building; now a locally listed building due to its architectural merit; the Lanchester Building is due to be converted into a primary school. In 2017 the College was awarded a Gold rating in the Teaching Excellence Framework administered by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Teaching Excellence Framework outcomes Former principals include Elizabeth Rushton (2004-2011), Tony Pitcher (2003-2004), and Andrew Bragg (1997 to 2003). Former Watford College principals include Terry Howard (? - 1986), Frank Baker (1986 - 1996), John Loveridge (1996 - 1997). Controversy During the year of 2018, late February, George Duke-Cohan a student of the college sent a threatening email stating that a bomb had been planted in the C-block of the college. The building was quickly evacuated and students were sent to the leisure centre located next to the college. Law enforcement were notified of the threat and an investigation then followed. George later admitted to being the perpetrator – this resulted in his suspension from the college. On March of the same year, George sent numerous emails to over 400 schools across the UK, using hijacked email addresses from the gaming community VeltPvP. The attacks affected schools in London, Manchester, and North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire Police state the following, regarding the incident \\"Our cybercrime unit detectives, supported by local officers, have looked at these incidents and it is not believed there is any genuine threat\\". The investigation put forward resulted in the arrest of George on 19 March, he was later released under investigation. BBC News Article \\"School bomb threats: Disgruntled Minecraft gamer 'behind hoax'\\" In September 2018, George was rearrested after carrying out another hoax, this time targeting a United Airlines flight from the UK to San Francisco. Over the phone, he claimed to be a concerned father whose daughter was on the flight which was supposedly hijacked. George then later pleaded guilty to this hoax and all of the previous charges put forward against him. He is now awaiting sentencing.

The band initially used music based on sampled loops created by Dine, but later moved to a lo-fi sound more akin to early Primal Scream than their previous band, with a Beach Boys influence, and have been compared to Stereolab and Broadcast. Beattie and Boyle split with Dine after the first few releases, initially with Dine also continuing with the Adventures in Stereo name for his own work, including the Yellow Album, released the same year as Beattie and Boyle's self-titled album, recorded with new collaborators. Beattie and Boyle continued with the name until 2000, with 2 further albums and a few singles. Dine, meanwhile, formed Noonday Underground.

While being a social enterprise, it retains the \\"community atmosphere of its origins as a working men's club\\". The club is split into three areas—a 400 capacity concert room, a bar area and games room section (which occasionally holds gigs) and a second 400 capacity concert area, known as the Community Room, which opened in 2017. The club was originally formed in 1913 by local businessmen, who built a wooden clubhouse at 33 Queen's Road which opened on 2 December of the same year. After falling into disrepair, this wooden structure was replaced by the present brick building at the cost of £160,00 in 1978, with the club officially reopening on 7 December. The Clark family took on the club's license in 1992 and began to put on gigs after a shift in the makeup of Hyde Park's population caused by more students moving into the area. Initial shows were focused around the local DIY music scene. From 2004 to 2005, noise complaints forced the club to briefly abandon gigs. After a period of fundraising, soundproof firedoors were purchased and installed, while a new public address system was added to the concert room as a result of a National Lottery grant. A few years later, in 2007, the Brudenell moved from being a members club to being a \\"publicly open, licensed place that runs as a social enterprise and reinvests its money\\". The club has played host to \\"secret gigs\\" by the likes of Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand, hosted The Cribs as they played three-consecutive nights, billed as \\"Cribsmas\\", in December 2007 and celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2013, with shows by The Wedding Present, The Fall and ¡Forward, Russia! among others. A \\"primary cog in the Leeds music scene\\", the Brudenell Social Club was joint winner of the best live music venue in 2014's Rock the House competition, and was shortlisted for The Fly magazine's 2014 UK Venue of the Year' award and the NME's Britain's Best Small Venue award in 2011, 2012 and 2015. History Although exact details regarding its foundation are unknown, it is believed that the Brudenell Social Club was started by a group of businessmen who wanted to create an unaffiliated club, free from ties to political parties or any other kind of movement. These businessmen formed the Brudenell as a \\"social and recreational club\\" in November 1913, and initially intended to build a clubhouse several hundreds yards from the eventual location, on land which would later be used to construct the Hyde Park Picture House. However, after this plan failed to come to fruition, a clubhouse was built at 33 Queen's Road, on the site of the present club's car park. Subsequently, this clubhouse opened on 2 December 1913. The original wooden structure had fallen into disrepair by 1978 and was replaced by the present \\"modern-style\\" brick building at a cost of £160,000. The Brudenell Social Club reopened on 30 November 1978, with an official opening taking place on 7 December featuring performances from comedian Bobby Knutt and trio The Jady Jays. On reopening, the club permitted female members for the first time in its history, although only men were allowed in the billiards and games room. The Brudenell's new \\"cabaret-style\\" concert room featured live entertainment on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights and, according to The Stage's Northern corrspondent Jim Daley, the club became \\"one of the most popular in the Leeds area\\" during the year after its reopening, with entertainments manager Jack Swithenbank \\"engaging known acts who provide value for money\\". The main bar area at Brudenell Social Club, pictured in May 2017. Malcolm and Patricia Clark became the Brudenell's licensees in 1992 after the committee who previously ran the club built up debts with the Inland Revenue, and, following a shift in the makeup of the local population which saw large numbers of students moving into the area, \\"rescued [the club] from financial ruin\\" by putting on bands. Gigs were initially staged by the likes of Mike Jolly, founder of the Holbeck-based Cloth Cat music charity, and members of the scene surrounding local DIY fanzine Cops & Robbers. The Termite Club also ran at the venue, hosting noise rock events. During the 1995 Hyde Park riots, the club staged a lock-in as local taxis were unable to operate. The Brudenell later hosted initial meetings by the group that set up Unity Day, a community festival created to \\"celebrate the people, culture and community of LS6\\" in the wake of the unrest. The Clarks' son, Nathan, took over the running of the club in 2004 after his father fell ill. In 2004–2005 the Brudenell was placed on a \\"final warning\\" following noise complaints and had to stop putting on shows. The club ran quizzes and \\"Bullseye nights\\", sold badges and, in July 2005, hosted the 'Keep the Brudenell A-Live Aid' all-day gig in order to raise enough money to purchase expensive acoustic fire doors. The success of this fundraising activity prompted an application for a National Lottery grant to purchase a new public address system for the concert room. In response to a change in the United Kingdom's licensing laws and the smoking ban implemented in England in 2007, which made it illegal to smoke in enclosed work places, the Brudenell moved from being a member's club to an entirely public venture—\\"a not for profit company that still has the same aims as the club always had [...] a publicly open, licensed place that runs as a social enterprise and reinvests its money\\"—with Nathan believing that the venue had to \\"evolve or die\\". Mogwai officially opened the Community Room on 7 September 2017. Unlike many social clubs in the United Kingdom, the Brudenell has never been part of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, which Clark believes has enabled the venue to be more flexible than may otherwise have been the case. All profits are reinvested—staff are paid a \\"living wage\\", and the club has been able to make improvements, such as installing new toilets and showers, and upgrading the dressing rooms, which Clark feels make the club of a higher quality than other venues \\"putting on similar gigs\\". The building itself has been \\"paid for\\", which means that the club does not have to worry about rent increases. The club is split into three areas—an amphitheatre- shaped 400 capacity concert area to the left of the entrance doors, with a bar area and games room (which occasionally holds gigs) and second, 400 capacity square-shaped concert area, the Community Room, to the right. The bar \\"retains the atmosphere of [a] working men's club\\", offering \\"comfortable\\" chairs, Sky television, a pool table and dartboard. The venue serves cask ales alongside speciality beers from around the world, and works with local companies, such as Kirkstall Brewery, to sell beer at competitive prices. In March 2017 the Brudenell announced plans to build a single storey extension; including extra space for gigs and community groups to meet; and a new toilet block with disabled access. This extension, named the Community Room, opened on 6 September 2017, hosting a performance from Waxahatchee. An official opening took place the following day when Mogwai played a show to support the release of their ninth studio album, Every Country's Sun. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the Brudenell endured a prolonged period of closure. During this time, the club released a series of t-shirts, featuring the name \\"Brudenell Social Distancing Club\\"—a pun on the social distancing public health measures in place in the UK at the time—in an attempt to \\"support the local community in a time like this, and spread a positive message\\". All proceeds from sales of the t-shirts went to the artists who designed them. In June 2020, the club received £23,600 emergency funding from Arts Council England to help alleviate financial pressures caused by the pandemic. Later in the year, a further £220,429 was provided by the UK government's Culture Recovery Fund to help the Brudenell \\"host a free weekly event as well as livestreams\\". The club's current logo, which appears on T-shirts promoting the venue, features Charlie, a King Charles Spaniel owned by the Clarks, who is often present behind the bar. Booking policy The Brudenell regularly showcases an \\"eclectic mix of up-and-coming bands, hip or soon-to-be- influential names and the acts that first inspired them, from punk to hip- hop\\", with around 75% of shows being put on by Nathan Clark himself. The venue has been described as a \\"primary cog in the Leeds music scene\\". Speaking about the club's booking policy to the BBC's Michael Savage in January 2017, licensee and general manager Nathan Clark stated that he believes audiences come back to the venue because \\"they have a degree of trust\\" in the Brudenell's taste when it comes to selecting bands to play the venue. Clark also stated that the club tries to support \\"good local artists\\", recommending them to touring bands and receiving tips from these musicians in return about \\"what's happening in their town\\". According to Clark, every band that plays the venue is \\"treated the same, regardless of their status\\" and, unlike many venues in the UK, the Brudenell does not ask for a cut of the money bands make from selling merchandise, such as CDs and T-shirts, during and after shows. Clark believes that these factors, combined with little touches such as \\"the wifi being personalised\\" and giving acts use of a microwave and washing facilities, result in bands being keen to return to play at the Brudenell — something which the venue encourages as it tries \\"build relationships for the long term\\" with performers. Notable performances The Brudenell Social Club celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2013 with an \\"eclectic mixture\\" of shows. Clockwise from top left: The Wedding Present, Girls Against Boys, Superchunk, Loop, and Rocket from the Crypt. Franz Ferdinand played a \\"secret gig\\" at the Brudenell in 2004, and a year later, on 20 October 2005, Kaiser Chiefs played a free \\"secret gig\\" at the venue, with doors opening at 12pm, to celebrate the birthdays of drummer Nick Hodgson as well as Ryan and Gary Jarman from The Cribs. The Cribs played three consecutive nights at the Brudenell in December 2007. Billed as \\"Cribsmas\\", the shows saw the band performing material from each of the three albums they had released up to that point—The Cribs, The New Fellas and Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever—along with associated b-sides. Support for the shows came from Kaiser Chiefs, Franz Ferdinand and Kate Nash. In December 2008, the Cribs released a triple DVD of their \\"Cribsmas\\" shows as Live At The Brudenell Social Club. Ten years later, in December 2017, The Cribs played a five night residency at the Brudenell. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the venue in December 2013, an \\"eclectic mixture\\" of acts were booked to showcase a range of musical genres that \\"expressed the values\\" of the Brudenell as a music venue; The Wedding Present, The Fall, Girls Against Boys, Loop and Rocket from the Crypt were among the bands who played at these anniversary shows. Leeds band ¡Forward, Russia! also played as part of the celebrations following their brief 2013 reformation. In a 2013 interview with the Yorkshire Evening Post's Duncan Seaman, Clark stated that shows by Tune-Yards, Edwyn Collins, Tom Tom Club and a double-bill featuring Explosions in the Sky and Four Tet are amongst his favourite performances at the club. Clark has also highlighted a performance by American garage rock band Thee Oh Sees in the games room and The Cribs' December 2007 shows as being particularly memorable. Awards In 2014, the Brudenell was joint winner with Base Studios in Stourbridge of the Best Live Music Venue category in that year's Rock the House competition, and was shortlisted for The Fly magazine's UK Venue of the Year award. It has also been nominated several times for the NME's Britain's Best Small Venue award, being shortlisted in the North East category in 2011 and 2012, and in the Yorkshire & Humberside category in 2015. In September 2016, general manager Nathan Clark was recognised with an INDIE50 listing for his work promoting live music at the Brudenell. The award, set up by online ticket sellers WeGotTickets, was designed to celebrate the \\"unsung idols of live music at a grassroots level\\". The Brudenell won the 'Grassroots Venue: Spirit of the Scene' award at the 2017 Music Week awards and the 'Best Venue Teamwork' award for clubs with a capacity of under 800 at the 2017 and 2019 Live Music Business Awards. Clark also won the 'Indie Promoter of the Year (Local impact)' award at the 2019 Live Music Business Awards.

The station closed in 1969.  Tayport branch  Newport-on-Tay East station was opened by North British Railway on 13 May 1879 http://www.nbrstudygroup.co.uk/nbr/pdfs/station_list.pdf with a branch line from the southern end of the Tay Bridge which was later extended to Tayport. In 1923 it became the LNER and from 1948 the Scottish Region of British Railways. The line was single track but with passing places at Wormit station and the second was at Newport-on-Tay East. The single platform Newport-on-Tay West railway station was much smaller.  Description  The East station had two platforms which were curved slightly to follow the line of the track. At the end nearest Station Road there was a level crossing and a pedestrian bridge. The main ticket office, and the stationmaster's house were situated on the up track (towards Tayport). On the down track, there was only a waiting room. The station was lit by gas lamps, which were activated by the station staff. The signal box was situated at the far end of the Eastbound platform, and the signalmen used to hand the pouches containing the tokens for the stretch of track to Tayport from a platform situated on the stair leading up to the signal box. The strip of land between the up track and Norwood Terrace contained allotments. The land on the other side of the main tracks was taken up by a goods yard. Two coal merchants had their premises here. There was also an additional spur of track leading to a ramp which was used for loading sugar beet. At harvest time, tractors loaded with beet would drive in and tip the contents of their trailers into railway waggons parked on this spur. The station layout shown on the 1914 Ordnance Survey map remained practically unchanged till it closed. There were two accidents in the station. In one case, a train hit one of the level crossing gates, and it had to be replaced. The other accident was more serious. A workman was killed during an accident while shunting coal waggons.  Opening of the Tay Road Bridge  The railway was mainly used by people who lived in Newport and worked in Dundee. Until the opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966 the Tay Ferry provided the only alternative means of getting there. The opening of the Road Bridge allowed direct bus services from Newport to Dundee, as well as easy access by car, thus directly leading to the closure of the line in 1969. A return ticket for the train service from Dundee to Newport-on-Tay purchased on the 3rd of May 1969. During the 1960s the trains were normally pulled by British Railways 2-6-4T engines. Later the steam trains were replaced by diesel multiple units, probably British Rail Class 101.

Construction and location The Midland Railway (MR) opened the station on its 'Disley cut off' line (correct name: the New Mills and Heaton Mersey Line). This line was completed in 1902, to improve access of the MRs fast trains from London St Pancras via Derby to Manchester Central. The station was located 800 yards (730 m) south of Hazel Grove's centre, at the point where the line crossed over the Macclesfield and Buxton roads by means of two over- bridges, that are still in use. There was a siding on the Up line towards New Mills for goods trains to recess into by reversing in off the main line. There was also a pair of sidings adjacent to the Down line and the station. These two sidings were also accessed by reversing back into them at the Cheadle Heath end. Nothing remains of the station platform or subway and only the footpath leading up from Buxton Road remains with original slatted wooden Midland Railway style fencing and gates, however some of this has now been lost due to a nearby car wash development. Hazel Grove (Midland) signalbox was located at the New Mills end of the station and lasted until closure in March 1977 when removed thereafter. Train service The station was underused. Very few trains stopped there as it was inconveniently located, so it was closed after only 15 years of use.

Its 445 acres (2 km²) contain 2,217 buildings, including Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site, a National Historic Landmark. This area includes much of the southeastern quarter of the city. Most of the buildings were constructed during the city's height of industrial development in the later 19th century, as opposed to the villas and mansions in the Montgomery-Grand-Liberty district. They housed many of the city's working-class population at the time, and the small businesses that served them. First recognized by the city in 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Today, it is a mix of extremes. Some of its neighborhoods are among the city's most desirable, offering panoramic views of the Hudson River's Newburgh Bay and the Hudson Highlands to the south. It is also home to some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, and historic preservation groups have expressed concern about many important properties being lost to urban blight and neglect. Geography The district is roughly bounded by Robinson Avenue (US 9W) to the west, Water Street and Bay View Terrace on the east, Monument and Renwick streets to the south and LeRoy Place and Broadway to the north. This area of Newburgh, combined with the other district, represents the core of the settled city by the end of the 19th century. It rises up gently from the riverside area to mildly rolling higher ground. Industrial properties, both vacant and in use, are concentrated closer to the river, while the higher neighborhoods are mostly residential, with some institutional buildings such as schools and churches scattered throughout. There are a few commercial areas, most notably along Liberty Street opposite Washington's Headquarters, taking advantage of tourist business at the historic site during the summer months; along Broadway near City Hall and also along a short block of William Street further south. Combined and treated as one district, the 4,000 contributing properties are the most of any historic district in New York. The 2,239 resources in the East End alone are the most of any federally recognized district in the state. Architecture Much of the district is characterized by two- or three-story brick townhouses in the Italianate style popular in the late 19th century for urban buildings. In Washington Heights, the blocks near the southeastern corner of the district, where views of the river open up, there are houses in many Victorian styles reflecting the rapid subdivision and development of that area between 1886 and 1900. The houses on and near Parmenter Street, one block west of Washington's Headquarters, are the only part of Newburgh that still reflects the village character of the settlement from the turn of the 19th century. Houses here are gabled two-story structures in the Federal style, not found much elsewhere in the city. =Significant contributing properties= The oldest property in the district and the city, Jonathan Hasbrouck's 1750 stone house, is today the center of Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site, recognizing the general's residence here during the years between British surrender at Yorktown and final withdrawal from the American colonies in 1783. In the 1850s, it acquired additional historical significance when it became the first state-recognized historic site in the country. Today it is one of Newburgh's two National Historic Landmarks, under the management of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. Another contributing property within the district has been separately listed in the National Register. The New York State Armory on Broadway had been vacant for decades after the New York National Guard unit stationed there moved to a newer building several blocks away in the 1930s. A fire in the 1970s had left it a blackened shell. It seemed likely to be torn down until it was sold to Orange County, which brought in a private developer to rebuild it with help from the state's Office of Historic Preservation. It now houses the county's Social Services operations in the city.

Preservation issues The city has recognized the historic district in its zoning, required architectural review of any significant construction within it, and initiated and encouraged many efforts to redevelop portions of it. Many properties remain abandoned and neglected, and in 1996 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the district as one of America's Most Endangered Places. As of 2007 it saw the district's outlook as favorable after the River City Development Corporation, a Community Development Corporation, obtained federal grants to rehabilitate some of the old row houses into affordable housing. In 1999 the Preservation League of New York State added a portion of the district to its \\"Seven to Save\\" list, since freed slaves congregated and lived around a nearby African Methodist Episcopal Zion church and the neighborhood in question, along Parmenter Street in the \\"village\\" portion of Newburgh, is one of the oldest African-American neighborhoods in the state. In April 2017 a $15 million \\"scattered site\\" development project using a combination of state/federal Low Income Housing and Historic Tax Credits was underway. \\"The Newburgh Core Revitalization Project\\" by Kingston-based not for profit RUPCO in cooperation with The Newburgh Community Land Bank will restore 15 buildings and transform the properties into 45 affordable rental apartments to assist middle income families, artists, veterans and the homeless. The revitalization project is expected to be completed by Sept. 2018, with first tenants arriving in late 2017. http://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/hudson-valley/news/2017/04/7/rupco- begins--15-million-core-revitalization-project-in-the-city-of-newburgh See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Orange County, New York ReferencesExternal links * Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Historic districts in Orange County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, New York Category:Newburgh, New York Category:U.S. Route 9W Category:Buildings and structures in Newburgh, New York ","title":"East End Historic District (Newburgh, New York)"},{"id":"15063532","text":"Basic salivary proline-rich protein 4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PRB4 gene.

Once the North Elkhorn Farm, many owners and tenants have occupied the area, even during the American Civil War. Most of the land acquired during Haggin's era has since been sold off to neighboring stud farms, but the original 765 acres including the columns and many of the historic barns and houses still exist at Elmendorf. History In about 1806, Robert Carter Harrison (1765–1840) brought his wife Ann Cabell Harrison (1771–1840) and their many children from their home in Clifton, Virginia, to Fayette County, Kentucky. There he bought the Old Kenney Farm, also known as Elk Hill, and later built his home, which came to be known as \\"Clifton\\". Elizabeth M. Simpson's book (See Ref) says the frame colonial style house was built prior to 1830; while Joe Jordon's book (See Ref) says it was built between 1835 and 1840. Robert's son, Carter (1796–1825) died before his father, so in 1840 \\"Clifton\\" passed to Robert's grandson Carter Harrison, Sr. (1825–1893), jointly with the child's mother Caroline Evaline (Russell) Carter (1797–1875). Caroline was the daughter of Colonel William Russell. Carter Henry Harrison, Sr. (1825–1893) sold \\"Clifton\\" in 1855 after his mother, Caroline, was remarried to Reverend Thomas Parker Dudley of Lexington, brother of noted surgeon Benjamin Winslow Dudley. Carter moved to Chicago where he served four consecutive terms as mayor (1879–1887) and was re-elected for a fifth term in 1893. On October 30, 1893, Harrison was assassinated in his own home. The Maysville, Kentucky Evening Bulletin headline said he was \\"Shot by a Crank\\".http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=evenews;cc=evenews;g=news;xc=1;xg=0;q1=carter%20henry%20harrison;rgn=full%20text;idno=eve1893103001_sn87060190;didno=eve1893103001_sn87060190;view=pdf;seq=1;passterms=1 Harrison died and was buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. His son Carter Harrison, Jr. (1860–1953) was elected mayor of Chicago 4 years after his father's murder, and served 5 terms. In 1855, Thomas Hughes (1789–1862), son of Cornelius Hughes, bought the farm from Carter Henry Harrison. He lived there with his wife Julia Ann Smith Hughes (1805–1846) and their four children, including daughter Kate Hughes McCreary (1844–1908), wife of Governor James B. McCreary (1838–1918) and son William Thomas Hughes (see next). Thomas and Julia Smith Hughes were buried on the Hughes farm, along with Thomas's brother, Michael Hughes, and his wife Mary Adams Hughes, and several children of one or the other couple. All of these family members were later re-interred in the Lexington Cemetery in a lot owned by Kate Hughes McCreary and Michael's son John T Hughes, noted Lexington horseman. In 1862 William Thomas \\"WT\\" Hughes (1832–1874) inherited the farm from his father, Thomas Hughes, and lived there with his wife Sallie Kirkpatrick (Cooper) Hughes and their four children for over a decade. A large oil painting of their son Cooper Hughes (1862–1928) as a small boy, shows the original \\"Clifton\\" home in the background. After the Civil War, Hughes began to buy more land, paying $100–$150 per acre at high interest rates, and not only breeding cattle but speculating in cattle in the New York market. WT borrowed heavily, and his loans were cosigned by his maternal uncle Granville Smith. In 1874, Hughes was forced to sell the farm to repay his creditors. In March 1874 Hughes sold of the Hughes farm to Milton H. Sanford. In June 1874, WT Hughes and his wife were relocating to a smaller farm in a nearby county, riding alongside the Kentucky River in their buggy, with pack wagons full of chattel and children following behind, when William was shot and killed from the cliff top by his uncle Granville Smith. Later that day Smith (1807–1874) shot himself. Both men left widows and children. Smith was buried in the Lexington Cemetery,http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=hughes&GSfn;=william&GSbyrel;=in&GSdyrel;=in&GSst;=19&GScnty;=1022&GScntry;=4&GSob;=n&GRid;=50195649&df;=all& and Hughes was buried first in the Richmond Cemetery, and later reinterred in Lexington alongside his wife Sallie. In 1875, the Hughes heirs sold another to Richard Penniston. Elmendorf Farm=Milton H. Sanford= In 1874, Milton H. Sanford purchased of the Hughes farm. Stanford had previously had a farm in New Jersey, named for the town of Preakness, New Jersey after which he also named his horse Preakness — the same horse for whom the Preakness Stakes is named. After moving to Kentucky, Sanford continued to use the same name. The stallion Virgil was based at Preakness Stud and sired three Kentucky Derby winners: Vagrant (1876), Hindoo (1881) and Ben Ali (1886). =Daniel Swigert= In 1881, Sanford sold the land as well as his bloodstock (including Virgil and other leading sire Glenelg) to Daniel Swigert, who had been the manager of the Woodburn Stud as well as a \\"pinhooker\\", one who buys horses and quickly sells them. Swigert renamed the farm Elmendorf for his wife's grandmother, Blandina Elmendorf Brodhead. For years Swigert ran Elmendorf, breeding many exceptional horses. He also purchased and later sold the champion Spendthrift, which he had named after his wife's spending habits. A while later, his wife responded by naming Spendthrift's younger brother, Miser. Before acquiring Elmendorf, Swigert had owned and then sold the 1870 Belmont Stakes winner Kingfisher, the 1873 Belmont Stakes winner Springbok and the 1877 Kentucky Derby winner Baden-Baden. He also bred the great Hindoo. While in charge of Elmendorf, Swigert bred Salvator, Firenze, and the Kentucky Derby winners Ben Ali and Apollo. Swigert sold Elmendorf in October 1891 to Con J. Enright. =Con J. Enright= Con Enright owned Elmendorf for less than six years, but imported several good breeding mares from Europe. Enright most notably bred U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Hamburg. He sold the farm to James Ben Ali Haggin at an October 22, 1897 auction held at Morris Park Racecourse in Morris Park, New York. =James Ben Ali Haggin= James Ben Ali Haggin, who already had had much success with Thoroughbreds in his Rancho Del Paso spread in California, expanded Elmendorf by buying quite a few of the surrounding farms. Under Haggin, the farm grew to over to over with 2,000 horses — his total investment was some $2 million. The expanded farm was centered along the Paris Pike, with over five miles of road frontage. In buying Elmendorf, Haggin bought Salvator, Miss Woodford, Firenze, Star Ruby, Water Boy, Hamburg Bell and quite a few other good horses. He stood the great Salvator here until the horse's death in 1909. It is possible that Salvator lies in an unmarked grave at Elmendorf. Haggin also built a $300,000 mansion on a small hill overlooking Elk Horn which he called \\"Green Hills,\\" a great Southern Mansion in style and feeling. He also built a model dairy farm and a greenhouse which he filled with exotic plants. The first record of Dexter cattle in the United States is when more than two hundred head were imported between 1905 and 1915, a large number of which were imported by Elmendorf Farm. Haggin's extensive Kentucky interests, including Elmendorf Farm, were managed in his absence by Charles Henry Berryman of Lexington. The Berryman family lived on farm property in a house that is still called the Berryman House. After \\"Green Hills\\" was demolished by Joseph Widener, the Berryman Home was the only habitable mansion on the farm and as such was occupied by Widener's grandson, Peter A. B. Widener III (1925–1999) and his family during the 1950s. When Haggin died in 1914, the estate was broken up. =Joseph E. Widener= In 1923, Joseph Widener (1871–1943) and his nephew, George, bought a part of Elmendorf. Joseph operated his portion as Elmendorf Form. George operated his portion as Old Kenney Farm. From then until the 1940s, the main part of Elmendorf was owned by Joseph Early Widener and then by his son Peter A. B. Widener II. In 1929, the elder Widener tore down Haggins' mansion \\"Green Hills\\" to void taxes on the unoccupied behemoth. He left the mansion's stately marble pillars which became a Central Kentucky landmark. Widener bought the stallion Fair Play as well as the broodmare Mahubah at the dispersal sale of August Belmont. Fair Play and Mahubah, who were the sire and dam of Man o' War, are buried at what is now called Normandy Farm. =Maxwell Gluck= In 1950, Maxwell Henry Gluck (1896–1984) purchased the original section of Elmendorf Farm along with its name rights. Gluck, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Darlington Stores Corporation and later the United States Ambassador to Ceylon, had his first success in racing when he bought Prince John for $14,300 at the 1954 yearling sales. The pillars of Haggins' \\"Green Hills\\" remained on Gluck's farm, and in front of them are buried Gluck's juvenile champion Protagonist (by Prince John), Speak John (also by Prince John), and Verbatim. Gluck owned Elmendorf until his death in 1984 after which his widow sold it and about 350 horses to Jack Kent Cooke. =Jack Kent Cooke= Cooke continued to use the property for his broodmare band until 1997, when he sold the remaining horses to Stonerside Stable. The property was sold to Dinwiddie Lampton, and is currently owned by the Lampton family's American Life and Accident Insurance Company. Most of the land is leased to Gaines-Gentry Thoroughbreds. Break up By 1951 Elmendorf had been reduced bit by bit as various parcels were sold off. The original section went to Max Gluck, along with its name - Elmendorf - and the remaining pillars of Green Hills. E. Barry Ryan bought the section with the original cemetery, calling it Normandy Farm whereon stood the statue of Fair Play erected by Widener. Buried in front of the statue are both Fair Play and Mahubah as well as many of their best sons and daughters bred by Widener, and quite a few other great runners. Other farms that were sliced from Elmendorf include Old Kinney Farm (owned by George D. Widener, Jr.) and Clovelly Farm (owned by Robin Scully). Clovelly Farm still exists, as does the Normandy Farm. Green Gates Farm, once Spendthrift Farm and then the Old Kenney Farm, also still functions today. =Dinwiddie Lampton, Jr.= Elmendorf was most recently acquired in 1997 for $5 million by Dinwiddie Lampton, Jr. (1914–2008), the president of American Life and Accident Co.Elmendorf owner Elizabeth Lampton dies - Thoroughbred Times Lampton and his wife were longtime coaching and pleasure driving enthusiasts with a collection of carriages and carriage horses. Lampton's wife, Elizabeth Whitcomb Lampton, died on March 22, 2008 at age 74, from a carriage accident on the property. Dinwiddie Lampton died six months later on September 25, 2008, at the farm. The family still owns the farm and it is leased to Sancal Racing and Stone Columns Stables at Elmendorf. References * \\"The History of Thoroughbred Racing in America\\" by William H.P.

It is a rare example of expressionist church architecture. Due to its unusual appearance, it is one of the best known churches in the city.  History  The commission for the construction of a church to be named after the Danish philosopher and hymn writer N. F. S. Grundtvig was decided through a competition, won by Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint in 1913. The foundation of the new church was only laid after World War I, on 8 September 1921, Grundtvig's birthday. Building took place mainly from 1921 to 1926 when the tower section was completed, leading to the initial inauguration of the so- called Tower Church in 1927. Further work on the interior and on adjacent buildings continued until 1940 and was completed by Klint's son Kaare Klint after his father's death in 1930. The church stands at the centre of a residential development (1924–36), also in yellow brick, designed by Jensen- Klint in harmony with the church.. Architecture Jensen-Klint's design for Grundtvig's Church is a synthesis of architectural styles. In preparation for the project, the architect studied many Danish village churches, particularly those on the island of Zealand with stepped gables. Their traditional building techniques, materials and decoration inspired his design. Klint merged the modern geometric forms of Brick Expressionism with the classical vertical of Gothic architecture. The most striking feature of the building is its west facade, reminiscent of a westwork or of the exterior of a church organ. It includes the 49 m (160 ft) tall bell tower. The imposing facade with its strong verticality guides one's eyes towards the sky. The bottom half of the tower is simple brick while the upper reaches present the appearance of one solid, rippling surface.. Klint decorated the nave with a version of the stepped gables common on Danish churches, but reinterpreted by doubling the apex. The nave was designed with generous dimensions: the triple-aisled hall church is 76 m (259 ft) long in total and 35 m (115 ft) wide; the nave has a height of 22 m (72 ft). Interior The interior, inspired by Gothic architecture and comparable in size to Copenhagen cathedral, fits a congregation of 1,440. Some five million yellow bricks, a typical Danish building material, were used for the edifice. In its floor plan, the interior resembles that of a typical Gothic church with a nave, two lateral aisles and a small transept. Its proportions are also Gothic: a long, narrow nave, an extremely high ceiling, the columns which rise up to pointed arches and the ribbed groin vaults above the nave and aisles. But it is the yellow brick and the lack of ornamentation which contribute to the Gothic verticality while adhering to the minimalist modern aesthetic. The two organs The church has two organs. The one on the north side of the nave near the chancel was built in 1940 by Marcussen & Søn, the facade being designed by Kaare Klint. It has 14 stops, two manuals and a pedalboard. The much larger Marcussen instrument at the western end of the nave was added in 1965 with a facade designed by Kaare Klint's son, Esben Klint. It has 55 stops, four manuals and a pedalboard. The largest of its pipes weighs 425 kg (937 lb) and, with a length of 32 feet (11 m), is the longest organ pipe in Scandinavia... Integration and flanking buildings The scheme also included the construction of a number of buildings collectively known as On the Hill (da. På Bjerget) on each side of the church, placing it in a symmetrical context to enhance its visual impact. Designed by Jensen-Klint in collaboration with Vilhelm Wittrup, Charles I. Schou and Georg Gøssel, the buildings contain the parish hall and apartments and were built from 1924 to 1926. A long tree-lined road leads through Bispebjerg cemetery directly towards the church and the flanking buildings, creating a viewing axis similar to those of the Baroque period. Grundtvig's church today The church is open to visitors all year, not just at the times of services. The great Marcussen organ is regularly used for concerts. The church is equipped with a wheelchair stair lift for the disabled people.

Through her mother, Diaz and her older sister have a younger half-sister named Sinclair who later became adopted by Diaz's father. Diaz was born of paternal Puerto Rican and maternal Cuban descent. Due to her father serving time in jail, Diaz and Solsky lived in a foster home until their father gained custody of the girls and raised them as a single father in Harlem. At the age of seven, Diaz decided she wanted to become a rapper to make a better life for herself and her family after her father's music career had failed and Diaz and her family found themselves living in a shelter. Career Diaz began her rap career at the age of nine in after hours nightclubs in Harlem, battling against other rappers twice her age. She won the Citywide Hip Hop competition in 2005 and became the youngest female entrant. That same year, Diaz recorded an album with Reggaeton Niños as the main vocalist and appeared in the music video for \\"Oye mi Canto\\". She signed a recording contract with independent label Hunc Records in 2007 and released her first album titled Welcome to My Show the same year with the song \\"Biggie Bounce\\" released as a single. Diaz directed her music videos for \\"Don't Stop the Dance\\" and \\"Sukoshidake Katamomoi\\". P-Star released two versions of herself singing in English and Japanese. She appeared in the Off-Broadway production of Take the Train to Maine, 2005's short film Sita and as Jessica Ruiz in the 2009 version of The Electric Company. Diaz has modeled clothing for Royal Addiction, Baby Phat, J. Lo, and Roca Wear. In 2008 P-Star released her exercise DVD \\"P-Star Workout DVD: Exercise Your Body and Mind, Vol. 1\\" to help fight childhood obesity. In 2017 P-Star released her come back single \\"Don't Sleep On Me\\" through SoundCloud. Diaz released the single \\"Broke\\" under the new stage name 'MISSPSTAR' in 2018 and directed the music video to accompany the single. This was followed by her third single \\"Left, Right\\". Personal life Diaz was accepted to Denison University in Ohio in 2015, majoring in theater and education. While in attendance at the school, she was a cheerleader and worked as a DJ for the school's radio station. In May 2017, Diaz graduated from Denison University with a BA in Theatre and Education. Diaz started a podcast titled Restless Mother regarding motherhood after the birth of her first child.

He was a lieutenant on Rooke's flagship at the Battle of Barfleur in 1693. He captured the Heureux off Cape Clear in 1710 and distinguished himself in action with the Spanish off Cartagena in 1711. He is chiefly remembered, however, for his role in the failure of the Blockade of Porto Bello, for which poor Government orders were largely responsible, during which he died of disease alongside thousands of his sailors. Career The Ranger's House, Greenwich. by George Robertson,1791. Built about 1700–20 for Captain Francis Hosier. National Maritime Museum, London. (PT2659) Hosier was the son of the Clerk of the Cheque (and Muster-Master) to Samuel Pepys who lived at the foot of Crooms Hill, Greenwich. A certain Francis Hosier was the Storekeeper at Deptford in 1684, earning a salary of £305, the highest paid at the Depot. (no ref to document provided) He became a lieutenant in the navy in 1692, when he was appointed to the Winchelsea, a 32-gun new frigate, after being in that station on board different ships for four years. Captain Francis Hosier was only 26 years old in 1699, when he arranged for the Greenwich residence today known as The Ranger's House to be built, by which time he had commanded only one ship, the Winchelsea, of 74 guns. In 1710, he was appointed captain of the Salisbury upon a cruise off Cape Clear when, by falling in with a 6-gun French ship he was able to capture the French vessel which was then renamed the Salisbury's Prize and taken into service. In 1719, he was appointed second captain of the Dorsetshire, advanced to be rear-admiral of the white squadron, and afterwards promoted to be vice-admiral of the blue, but the fleet was ordered to be dismantled before it was put to the sea. In 1720, he was appointed second captain of the Dorsetshire with the honorary rank of rear-admiral of the blue squadron.Campbell, John, Naval history of Great Britain: including the history and lives of the British Admirals, Vol. 4, p. 452, London 1818 After the War of the Spanish Succession, he was suspended as a suspected Jacobite until 1717, but became vice-admiral in 1723. Blockade of Porto Bello In March 1726, Hosier was sent to command a squadron on the Jamaica Station with orders to prevent Spain from shipping its treasures home.Cundall, p. xx Viscount Townshend, Secretary of State, consulted the former privateer Woodes Rogers, who was in London at the time, as to the probable means and route the Spaniards would adopt to get their treasure home. From past experience Rogers probably knew more than any other person then in England of the favoured Spanish tactics for evading detection. A report dated 10 November 1726, was delivered, in conjunction with Capt. Jonathan Denniss,Probably the same Capt. Denniss who in 1718 conducted an expedition to Havana, the proceedings of which are in PRO CO 137,13; Denniss was also associated with Leonard Cocke, a factor of the South Sea Co. in Santiago de Cuba.

Adams (1970), A cruising voyage round the world, Dover Publications, p. xxxviii, At first Hosier met with success in his Blockade of Porto Bello. However, under strict orders not to attempt a capture of the town, which he could without difficulty have achieved with his 20 ships, he was forced to loiter and cruise off a mosquito infested coast. Yellow fever broke out and Hosier himself died of the fever (or as is said by some contemporary commentators \\"of a broken heart\\"), whilst on the Breda off Vera Cruz,Beatson, Robert, A Political Index to the Histories of Great Britain & Ireland, or a Complete register of the Hereditary Honours, Public Offices, and Persons in Office, from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time. Vol II, London 1806 as did between 3,000 and 4,000 of his sailors. Eventually, during the 1730s, the government appeasement policies of men like Walpole, and not Hosier personally, were blamed for the disaster. The episode is described as follows in Percy's Reliques of 1765. > \\"He (Hosier) accordingly arrived at the Bastimentos near Porto Bello, but > being employed rather to overawe than to attack the Spaniards, with whom it > was probably not our interest to go to war, he continued long inactive on > that station, to his own great regret. He afterwards removed to Carthagena, > and remained cruising in these seas, till far the greater part of his men > perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy climate. This brave > man, seeing his best officers and men thus daily swept away, his ships > exposed to inevitable destruction, and himself made the sport of the enemy, > is said to have died of a broken heart. Such is the account of Smollett, > compared with that of other less party writers\\". Hosier was replaced by two further admirals, who likewise successively perished of tropical diseases. Hosier's body was given a temporary burial- place in the ballast of his flagship, the Breda, where it remained, until it was despatched to England, late in the year, on board the snow the Happy Return, under Commander Henry Fowkes.Clowes, William Laird (1997), The Royal Navy, Chatham Publishing, p. 45 (vol 3), Presumably the body had first been embalmed. He was buried in the family vault, with much funerary pomp, at St Nicholas, Deptford on 28 February 1728. In 1739, twelve years after Hosier's death, at the start of the War of Jenkins' Ear Admiral Vernon accomplished what Hosier had been denied from doing, and captured Porto Bello with only six ships. Admiral Hosier's Ghost Edition of poem by Richard Glover Admiral Hosier's Ghost, written 1740. This edition with coloured etching by C. Mosley (July 1740). Sheet 415 * 283 mm. National Maritime Museum, Greenwich (PW 3959) (See full text on Wikisource s:Admiral Hosier's Ghost Vernon's success prompted the poet Richard Glover in 1740 to write the ballad Admiral Hosier's Ghost, sung to the tune of Come and Listen to my Ditty. It is an apology for the failure of Hosier's earlier mission, and seeks to absolve Hosier of having shown a lack of initiative, blaming rather Admiralty orders \\"not to fight\\", which were obeyed only \\"against his heart's warm motion\\", having been \\"sent in this foul clime to languish\\". The Ghosts of Hosier and 3,000 of his sailors appear from the sea to Vernon shortly after his victory and Hosier charges him to \\"let Hosier's wrongs prevail\\" by drawing notice to the forgotten affair in Opposition circles in England. Only then will the ghosts find their rest. It is thus an attack on Walpole's half-hearted commitment to the war.The ballad consists of 11 verses which are here quoted for illumination: As near Porto-Bello lying On the gently swelling flood, At midnight with streamers flying Our triumphant navy rode; There while Vernon sate all-glorious From the Spaniards' late defeat; And his crews, with shouts victorious, Drank success to England's fleet, Descendants Francis Hosier married Diana Pritchard at St Bride's, Fleet Street, 4 July 1710, as recorded in the IGI. In 1743, a William Hosier made a benefaction of £300 in South Sea annuities to the Deptford St Nicholas Charity School established in 1723, to educate 4 children. It has been supposed that this William Hosier was a descendant of the Admiral, but there is no known evidence to support this assumption.'Deptford, St Nicholas', The Environs of London: volume 4: Counties of Herts, Essex & Kent (1796), pp. 359-385.

Land-based shark fishing is defined as attempting to capture or actually capturing sharks using a rod, reel, line, and hook(s) from the land or anything permanently attached to the land, for example, jetties, piers or bridges. Among the defining efforts of the ILSFA is the designation of a new world record category for sharks released after capture. By using a widely accepted large species estimated weight formula, in conjunction with other specific qualifying measures, anglers will have the opportunity to be officially recognized internationally for their accomplishments without having to weigh their catch. With large, predatory species, such as sharks, this has never been practical without killing an animal for the purpose of obtaining its true weight. ILSFA will also issue records for weighed fish. However, the expanding trend in this rapidly growing sport is the practice of catch and release. The fusion of this trend with the new record category, along with cooperative shark research already conducted by many anglers, a devoted membership and partnerships with various research organizations, tackle manufacturers and the recreational fishing industry as a whole is intended to be a win-win-win combination of interests. The ILSFA was founded in 2006 by the current president, Sean Paxton. The ILSFA has been associated with the fishermen that have a reckless disregard for state conservation laws and progressive game management. The ISLFA has been promoted on the South Florida Shark Club fishing forum by William Fundora where many pictures of large sharks harvested are posted.

Classification  This gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase which catalyzes phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the D-4 position, yielding phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). Besides the fact, that PI4P serves as a precursor for other important phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PI4P is an essential molecule in the cellular signaling and trafficking especially in the Golgi apparatus and the trans Golgi network. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases are evolutionary conserved among eukaryotes and include four human isoforms * phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) * phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) * phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-alpha (PI4K2A) * phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-beta (PI4K2B)  Function  Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-alpha (PI4K2A) is the most abundant phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in human cells and is responsible for the synthesis of approximately 50% of the total PI4P within the cell. PI4K2A is associated mainly with the membranes of the trans Golgi network and early and late endosomes; its membrane association is achieved by a heavy palmitoylation within a specific cysteine-rich motif. Besides the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PI4K2A is involved in various cell processes including membrane trafficking, regulation of endosomal sorting promoting target protein recruitment to endosomes or trans Golgi network, or signal transduction. Particularly, it regulates e.g. targeting of clathrin adaptor complexes to the Golgi apparatus, EGFR signaling, or the Wnt signaling pathway.  Clinical significance  Dysfunction of PI4K2A may contribute to tumour growth, spastic paraplegia, Gaucher's disease, or Alzheimer's disease.  Structure  PI4K2A is composed of a proline-rich N-terminal region and a kinase domain located C-terminally. The proline-rich N-terminal region contains physiologically important binding sites for a ubiquitin ligase Itch and clathrin adaptor complex 3, but is likely disordered and dispensable for the kinase activity. The kinase domain can be divided into N-terminal and C-terminal lobes with the ATP binding groove and putative phosphatidylinositol binding pocket in between. The C-lobe of the kinase domain contains an additional lateral hydrophobic pocket with no distinct function assigned yet.

The protein encoded by this gene can also interact with the X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and this interaction enhances the anti-apoptotic activity of this protein via the JNK1 signal transduction pathway. Two pseudogenes, located on chromosomes 1 and 7, have been found for this gene.  Interactions  ALS2CR2 has been shown to interact with XIAP.

Seale covers most of the civil parish of Seale and Sands and the steep slope and foot of the south side of the Hog's Back (mid-western section of the North Downs between Farnham and Guildford) as well as a large hill which exceeds it – as such is part of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Etymology ;Current localities The name, Seale, may derive from the Old English word for \\"hall\\" or, alternatively, for \\"willow\\" (see for example Salfords).English Place Name Studies, Surrey volume The Sands is not a relatively old name for any part of Seale, first recorded in Tudor period records, and derives from the quantities of Bargate sandstone and sand present in the far north-west of the Greensand Ridge especially in its high uplands, crowned here by the highest point in the parish, Crooksbury Hill. ;Former settlement or farmstead Binton Farm takes its name from a Saxon settlement of Binton, which bears the prefix of an Old English personal name and standard suffix for any settlement. Topography View of Seale parish from the slopes of the North Downs looking south towards the Pilgrims' Way and Greensand Ridge beyond At the top of a short dry valley, at the foot of the steep Hog's Back, is the parish church of St Laurence, Seale. 800m down the valley is a spring, whose stream leads to Cutt Mill and hence to the Wey. The land undulates, between 165m in the southwest, down to 55m in the east. The north border is the 100 to 140m crest of a long range of hills with the popular name, the Hog's Back.Grid square map Ordnance survey website History Twin listed homes that date almost wholly to the 18th century Sand-adapted plants on one of the more undulating stretches of North Downs Way Seale in the Kingdom of England remained in its county but was also in the hundred of Farnham. Successive bishops retained right of free warren and other manorial privileges into the 19th century. Seale's medieval parish church and rector served equally Tongham to the north until 1866, however much of the land was owned by the Bishop of Winchester who owned much of far-west Surrey since the early holder of that position Henry (of Blois) or Winchester, who used his power and status to build Farnham Castle. The manor farm, evidencing this, were tenants of the Bishops of Winchester \\"for three lives\\" from 1839 (although they sold this interest in 1856).Surrey County Council history pages From the Tudor period, as evidenced by memorials in Seale church, the main landowner was the Woodroffe family (of whom two, David and Nicholas, father and son, were Sheriffs of London in 1554 and 1573 respectively), and later, by descent through a female line, the Chester family. They were seated at Poyle, Tongham, on the other side of the Hog's Back, which was originally part of the parish of Seale; their landholdings also extended south of the Hog's Back into what remained of the parish of Seale after Tongham was split off into a separate parish in 1866. As late as 1899, Henry Chester objected to being asked to give up his pew in Seale Church when a new plan was circulated by the churchwardens. The mansion at Poyle Park is now demolished and its lands subdivided in the twentieth century – an interior from Poyle Park is on display in the Museum of London. Hampton Lodge (below) was originally a hunting lodge, occupied by the wealthy Long family. In the 19th century, it passed through a female line into the hands of a branch of the Howard family of the Dukes of Norfolk (and Earls of Surrey) who took up residence and enlarged their estate by acquisition until it became, from about 1918, the largest landholding in the parish of Seale. The Hampton Estate was sold by the Howard family to the Thornton family in 1929 and remains in the hands of their descendants. 'Wood' Lane, which runs from the nucleus of Seale up to the top of the Hog's Back, shares its name with that of the family who leased Seale Manor Farm. Amenities=Village hall= A village hall provides regular events, near the old school and hosts parish council meetings. =Church= St Laurence's church The church was established in the 12th century as an outpost of Waverley Abbey. The bell tower houses a peal of six bells, the oldest and largest cast in the 16th century. The church was extensively restored and enlarged in about 1860. It is served by a Rector, who now also has care of the adjacent parishes of Puttenham and Wanborough. These three parishes were formally merged in 2004, although they retain their separate places of worship. Tongham was originally part of the parish of Seale, but it became an independent parish in 1866.St Laurence's, Seale The Church of England Retrieved 10 November 2013 =Golf course= In the west of the parish, associated with The Sands which is immediately south-east of it, is Farnham Golf Club. The first five holes start in parkland after which there is a sudden change in scenery as the pine trees close in and the heather replaces the grass.Farnham Golf Club English Golf Courses (directory with reviews) Retrieved 10 November 2013 Landmarks=Oldest house= The oldest building, apart from the church, is The Lyttons, a Grade II listed house which stands next to the churchyard but away from the road. This was originally an open hall house as shown by blackened rafters and the oldest parts of the fabric have been dated to the early 1500s. A brick chimney was inserted and the open hall was divided into an upper and lower storey by the insertion of an upper floor in the 1600s. The next oldest building is nearby East End Farm, another Grade II listed building which dates from the later part of the 1500s: about 1560-1580 compared with the Lyttons' dating of circa 1520-1550. =Houses associated with Manor Farm= Adjacent to the church are 17th and 18th century joined buildings known as Manor Farm converted into craft shops and a tea room.Manor ('House') 'Farm' (Craft shops and tea room) Manor Farm Cottages,Manor Farm Cottages and Seale Lodge CottagesSeale Lodge Cottages stand opposite the church, clustered around the craft shop/tea room. These date to the early 18th century. Beside them is Stable Cottage of later that century.Stable Cottage =Hampton Estate= Most of the non-forested, agricultural land in Seale is appurtenant to (attached to or let by the owners of) Hampton Lodge, a Grade II listed Regency period mansion of c.1810. The tall two-storey house is Stuccoed brick to its façade with mansard slate roofs and some fishscale banding.Hampton Lodge This estate is an early 20th-century merger of land formerly owned by the Long family, land formerly that of Seale Lodge, and agricultural and parkland formerly comprising the Great Down estate, centred on another mansion at the top of the Hog's Back, Great Down, which was demolished in the 1950s. The Hampton Estate was acquired by Eustace Thornton in 1929. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Richard Thornton, KCVO, OBE, Lord Lieutenant of Surrey 1986–1997 and then by Sir Richard's daughter and son-in-law, Bridget and Bill Biddell. =Heathersett, Littleworth and park gardens= The 1873, rubblestone built, stone dressed, Grade II listed building in its listed park in the far south known as Heathersett, Littleworth has been attributed to R. Norman, architect. The listed park is due to its later designer, Gertrude Jekyll. James Mangles, who lived at Valewood, Haslemere, was one of the earliest rhododendron collectors and hybridisers. When James died in 1884, most of his plant collection was brought to Littleworth Cross and Harry continued hybridising and exhibiting rhododendrons, with the help of his sister Clara. Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932), who lived nearby at Munstead, knew the Mangles family and was visiting one afternoon in May 1889 when she was introduced to a young architect, Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) who was designing a gardener's cottage and some garden buildings for Harry Mangles. The meeting was important for both Lutyens and Jekyll: she discovered someone with a similar love of the vernacular architecture of south-west Surrey, who would design her new home, Munstead Wood (qv), and through her, he was introduced to many potential clients. Lutyens and Jekyll began a collaboration of building and garden design that would last until her death in 1932. ;Former landmarks Seale Lodge, built in ornate style with surrounding landholdings fell into dilapidation and was demolished 1970. The village school has closed and been converted into a private house. Transport The village is well connected by roads but not rail and had approximately 50% of its working population recorded in 2011 as commuting 20–40 km, living in the rural outer Metropolitan Green Belt yet commuting to major employment areas such as London, Farnborough, Fleet and Aldershot. Specific long-distance roads are the A31 and the A331 roads (the Blackwater Valley Route) dual carriageway; along the entire northern border and north-west, respectively.

PNGase is a de-N-glycosylating enzyme that removes N-linked or asparagine-linked glycans (N-glycans) from glycoproteins. More specifically, NGLY1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond between the innermost N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and an Asn residue on an N-glycoprotein, generating a de-N-glycosylated protein, in which the N-glycoylated Asn residue is converted to asp, and a 1-amino-GlcNAc-containing free oligosaccharide. Ammonia is then spontaneously released from the 1-amino GlcNAc at physiological pH (<8), giving rise to a free oligosaccharide with an N,N’-diacetylchitobiose structure at the reducing end.  Discovery  Occurrence of cytoplasmic PNGase activity in mammalian cells was first reported in cultured cells. This enzyme differ from other “reagent” PNGases from almond (glycoamidase/PNGase A), or bacteria (N-glycanase/PNGase F), that is often used for structural/functional studies of N-glycans, in several enzymatic properties, including the requirement of a reducing reagent for activity and a neutral pH for optimal activity. The gene encoding the cytoplasmic PNGase was first identified in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and gene orthologues have since been found in wide variety of eukaryotes including mammals. In terms of the tissue distribution of the mouse Ngly1 gene, enzyme activities as well as transcripts were detected in all tissues/organs examined.  Structure  The catalytic residues of the cytoplasmic PNGase is known to reside in a domain called transglutaminase domain. NGLY1, when compared with the yeast orthologues, possesses extended N-terminal and C-terminal sequences in addition to the transglutaminase domain. Among the additional domains found in NGLY1, the PUB (PNGase- and ubiquitin-related) domain was first identified through a bioinformatics analysis. While it was initially hypothesized that it might serve as a protein-protein interaction domain, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is now accumulating. On the other hand, the C-terminal PAW domain (a domain present in PNGases and other worm proteins). has now been shown to be involved in the binding of oligosaccharides to PNGase. In terms of the crystal structures of mouse Ngly1, a catalytic core domain, a C-terminal domain including PAW domain and an N-terminal domain including PUB domain. have been obtained.  Function  Regarding the function of NGLY1, it has been shown that the enzyme is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD), one of the ER quality control/homeostasis systems for newly synthesized glycoproteins. The functional importance of NGLY1 in the ERAD process, however, is not clearly understood. It has also been suggested that NGLY1 is closely involved in MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation. The Ngly1-mediated (glycosylated) Asn-to-Asp deamidation constitutes, together with other reactions such as transpeptidation, unconventional post- translational modifications for antigenic peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules.  NGLY1-binding proteins  Through yeast two-hybrid screening, it has been shown that NGLY1 proteins can bind to several proteins, mostly through the N-terminal domain including the PUB domain. In vivo and in vitro interactions between NGLY1 and several ERAD-related proteins have been reported. While the importance of those protein-protein interactions to NGLY1 functions remain to be clarified, it can be assumed that such interactions may be advantageous for an efficient ERAD process.  Clinical significance  In 2012, NGLY1 deficiency, involving mutations in the NGLY1 gene locus was first identified through an exome analysis. As of now, the clinical features of 11 patients have been reported. One cerebral visual impairment (CVI) patient also had a mutation in NGLY1 gene. The clinical effects include neuromotor impairment, intellectual disability, and neuropathy. It has also been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Details of the mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis of the NGLY1-deficiency remains unknown, while the intracellular accumulation of N-GlcNAc proteins, due to the excess action of cytosolic endo-b-N-acetylglucosaminidase to misfolded glycoproteins, in Ngly1-deficient cells has been hypothesized as a potential cause. NGLY1 deficiency has drawn attention in the public. Studies have been carried out to discover small-molecules that can bind to the transglutaminase domain of the protein to stabilize it as a potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of disorder caused by NGLY1 mutants. Notes References  ","title":"NGLY1"},{"id":"15063819","text":"The Birmingham Journal was a weekly newspaper published in Birmingham, England, between 1825 and 1869. A nationally influential voice in the Chartist movement in the 1830s, it was sold to John Frederick Feeney in 1844 and was a direct ancestor of today's Birmingham Post. History The newspaper was founded as a Tory newspaper by a printer called William Hodgetts in 1825 to provide an alternative to The Times, whose editorial line was controversial locally. Historical copies of the Birmingham Journal, dating back to its first issue in 1825, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive.Digitised copies of the Birmingham Journal =Chartist heyday= The newspaper's political tone changed dramatically in 1832, however, when it was sold to prominent Unitarian and Radical Joseph Parkes, who appointed R. K. Douglas as editor. Douglas was a national figure of the reform movement: the secretary of Thomas Attwood's reformed Birmingham Political Union and the author of the Chartist National Petition of 1838. With its close connections to the leaders of Birmingham's reform movement—which itself was at the forefront of national political life—the Journal gained a high profile and wide circulation. Its sales peaked at 2,500 per issue; and with the majority of newspaper readers during the era reading or listening to newspapers in communal reading rooms rather than buying their own copies, it was probably reaching about half of the population of Birmingham. The appeal of Chartism meant that its influence also stretched well beyond the local area: in 1839 it sold seventy-one weekly copies as far away as Dunfermline. With the decline in local agitation for reform in the 1840s the newspaper's circulation dropped dramatically however. By 1844 it was only selling 1,200 copies per week when it was sold by Parkes to John Frederick Feeney. =Feeney= Feeney was first and foremost a newspaperman rather than a political agitator. He swiftly appointed the young John Jaffray to the editorship and maintained the popular appeal of a moderate Radical line. Chartism at the time was losing support in Birmingham through its adoption of a more extremist position in tune with the more pronounced class divisions of the cities of the North of England and Feeney and Jaffray's instinct was to follow local opinion rather than stay loyal to a movement. The Journal's fortunes were also helped by economic changes. Rising levels of literacy and decreasing costs of production, coupled with Feeney and Jaffray's journalistic and commercial flair, saw circulation rise to 23,000 by the 1850s. The boom in railway building of the late 1840s greatly boosted the market for classified advertising and by 1855 the Journal was making a profit of £5,000 per week, comparable to that of a national newspaper. =The move to daily publication= The change that ultimately led to the end of the Journal was one which initially appeared as a prime opportunity. The 1855 Stamp Act removed the tax on newspapers and transformed the news trade. The price of the Journal was reduced from seven pence to four pence and circulation boomed. The change ran deeper, however. While individual copies of newspapers were each taxed, the economics of newspaper production favoured large weekly publications. Untaxed, it became possible to sell a newspaper for a penny, and the advantage lay with smaller, more frequent publications that could keep their readers more up to date. Feeney and Jaffray initially contemplated a second weekly edition of the Journal, but the launch of Birmingham's first daily newspaper by prominent radical George Dawson—the short-lived Birmingham Daily Press—provoked them into launching their own daily title—the Birmingham Daily Post, later simply the Birmingham Post in 1857. The Journal was initially maintained as a weekly publication complementing the daily Post, but the launch of the Post's Saturday edition—the Saturday Evening Post—rendered its situation untenable and the Journal ceased publication in 1869.

The Samoan international cemented his place in the side straight away and was a consistent player throughout the 2005/06 season, playing 23 league and cup games throughout the campaign. His performances and commitment was recognised by the Warriors coaching staff when they selected him as the Player of the Year, the award for which he picked up at the club’s end of season awards celebration. Last season Rasmussen signed a new three-year deal, which will keep him at Sixways until 2010. In 2012, Ramussen announced that he would leave Worcester Warriors and retire from Rugby.

This gene encodes a testis-specific, differentiation antigen, acrosomal vesicle protein 1, that arises within the acrosomal vesicle during spermatogenesis, and is associated with the acrosomal membranes and matrix of mature sperm. This gene consists of 4 exons and its alternative splicing generates multiple distinct transcripts, which encode protein isoforms ranging from 81 to 265 amino acids. The longest transcript is the most abundant, comprising 53-72% of the total acrosomal vesicle protein 1 messages; the second largest transcript comprises 15-32%; the third and the fourth largest transcripts account for 3.4-8.3% and 8.7-12.5%, respectively; and the remaining transcripts combined account for < 1% of the total acrosomal vesicle protein 1 message. It is suggested that phenomena of cryptic splicing and exon skipping occur within this gene. The acrosomal vesicle protein 1 may be involved in sperm-zona binding or penetration, and it is a potential contraceptive vaccine immunogen for humans.

It ceased to exist in 1873, when it was split into the two new municipalities Oberbözberg and Unterbözberg. On 1 January 2013 the former municipalities of Gallenkirch, Linn, Oberbözberg and Unterbözberg merged to form the new municipality of Bözberg.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 History=Gallenkirch= Gallenkirch is first mentioned in 1338 as Gallenkilch. During the Middle Ages, Gallenkirch was part of the district of Hornussen under the city of Bad Säckingen. Religiously, until the Reformation the residents were also part of the parish of Hornussen. The local chapel was dedicated to Saint Gall, but is no longer standing. Portions of the structure were incorporated into a later building. After the Reformation the village became part of the reformed parish of Bözberg. Under Bernese rule (1460-1798) the village was part of the Thalheim court. In the 19th and 20th century, several attempts to merge Gallenkirch into the village of Linn failed. However, since 1917, children attend the local school in Linn, and other infrastructure problems are solved through inter-municipal cooperation. In Gallenkirch there is no shopping or other economy. Today's inhabitants are farmers or commuters to the nearby industrial centers. =Linn= Linn is first mentioned around 1303-08 as ze Linne. In 1307 it was mentioned as ze Lind. The name is probably connected with the 500- to 800-year-old, legendary Linden tree which is east of Linn. In the Middle Ages it probably belonged to the vogtei of Elfingen. In 1460 it was incorporated as part of the court of Bözberg in the Canton of Bern. Initially, its inhabitants were part of the Elfingen-Bözen parish, and after 1649 the Bözberg parish. Before the Reformation in 1528, it possessed a chapel. Agriculture was the major economic activity up into the middle of the 19th century. Due to declining opportunities in the mid-19th century, many of the farming families migrated away. By the end of the 20th century there were seven farms, while most other workers in the region were working in Brugg. Since the 1990s, Linn has been accessible by Postauto. =Oberbözberg= Aerial view (1950) Oberbözberg is first mentioned in 1189 as Bozeberch.

The station was opened on 2 November 1885 as the southern terminus of the Staines & West Drayton Railway (SWDR). The station was originally named \\"Staines\\", although the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) already had a Staines railway station on the opposite side of the town centre. The LSWR had refused access to its station because the SWDR was operated by the rival Great Western Railway (GWR). The two companies competed to Windsor and Reading, Berkshire and the LSWR regarded the SWDR as encroaching on its territory in Staines. The station was in Wraysbury Road at the junction with Moor Lane. The building was a 19th-century villa of London stock brick that had been built for the owner of the adjacent Pound Mill on the River Colne. The SWDR bought the house from the miller and had it converted it into the station building. Tracks and a goods yard were laid north of the house and a single platform with a short canopy was built. The station in August 1962 with a British Rail Class 121 at the platform On 26 September 1949 British Railways renamed the station \\"Staines West\\". In 1964 it had 14 trains on weekdays. On 29 March 1965 BR withdrew passenger services on the branch and closed the station. After closure to passengers the goods yard was demolished and a rail accessed-oil storage depot built in its place. In 1981 then the line north of the station was severed by the building of the M25 motorway so a new link to the Windsor line was laid to serve the oil depot. It closed ten years later.Airtrack Home Page The station building survives and has been converted into commercial offices.

Function  KNL1 is part of the outer kinetochore. It is a part of KMN network of proteins together with MIS12, and NDC80. KNL1 is involved in microtubule attachment to chromosome centromeres and in the activation of the spindle checkpoint during mitosis. The CASC5 gene is upregulated in the areas of cell proliferation surrounding the ventricles during fetal brain development.  Interactions  CASC5 has been shown to interact with MIS12, BUB1, BUBR1 and ZWINT-1. Polymorphisms Homozygous polymorphisms in the CASC5 gene have been seen in patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH). The mutation resulted in the skipping of exon 18 transcription, causing a frameshift and the production of a truncated protein. This truncation inhibits the binding ability of MIS12.

Biography  His father (Oskar Richard Klemm) was a versatile musician, who besides his main instrument (the double bass) played various other instruments which gained him a musical reputation through his engagements at private celebrations and events such as weddings. As a child Richard Klemm received from his father a musical education in several instruments (the cello, piano, violin and trumpet), and he also sang in the boys' choir Dresdner Kreuzchor. In 1919 Klemm left Dresden and took up the position of cellist with the Königsberg Kurorchester. During the years 1923-1926 he studied the cello with Hugo Becker in Berlin, composition with Paul Juon, and the piano. He graduated in both musical disciplines, the cello and the piano. For his final graduation examination pieces he played the solo cello sonata by Zoltán Kodály and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3. After completing his studies Richard Klemm became a cellist with the Staatskapelle Berlin (the orchestra of the Berlin State Opera. At the same time he also played in the chamber music ensembles of the Staatskapelle Berlin as well as with the Kniestädt Quartet. In 1950 he taught himself to play the viola da gamba. In 1958 Richard Klemm was appointed professor at the West Berlin Academy of Music. Several of his pupils became cellists with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (Wolfgang Boettcher, Christoph Kapler, Jörg Baumann, Alexander Wedow). Klemm's compositional work for four cellos contributed to the founding of The 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic. He also composed pieces for the viola da gamba and passed on the playing technique of this instrument to his pupils. Later, his colleague wrote for him a concerto for viola da gamba and orchestra. For many years Klemm was a member of the Richard Wagner Festival Orchestra in Bayreuth. His best-remembered compositions are the pieces he wrote for four cellos (\\"Bolero\\", \\"Habanera\\", \\"España\\" and \\"Concert Waltz\\"). He wrote arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's Art of Fugue for string quartet, as well as arrangements for four cellos of the cello concertos of Joseph Haydn, Robert Schumann and Camille Saint-Saëns. In recognition of his service to music Richard Klemm was awarded a medal: the Bundesverdienstkreuz (German Service Cross with ribbon). He was married to Ilse Ebermann and had three sons.
