First formed in 1586, by the late 17th century it usually comprised six infantry regiments, three recruited primarily from Scotland and three from England. Throughout the 16th and early part of the 17th centuries, units of foreign mercenaries were commonly used by all European powers. Domestic opposition to permanent armies as a result of the 1638-1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant British monarchs also used the Brigade to create a pool of trained officers, who could be called on when needed. However, in the early 18th century, increasing demand meant permission to recruit in Britain was restricted on a number of occasions and finally banned after 1757. The costs of participation in the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession marked the decline of the Dutch Republic as a Great Power. After 1714, the Brigade was reduced to three regiments and primarily used to garrison the Barrier forts. When it was dissolved in 1782, many officers were British, often from families with a long tradition of service with the Brigade but the vast majority were Dutch-born. It became regiments 22, 23 and 24 of the regular Dutch army and after 1784 ceased to be a separate unit. Its traditions and battle honours were continued by the 94th Foot, a regiment raised in 1794 for service in India; this ended in 1881, when the 94th became part of the Connaught Rangers. Formation in 1586-1648 Earl of Leicester as Governor- General, 1586; first commander of the Brigade The Dutch fight for independence from Spain in the Eighty Years' War of 1568–1648 attracted support from Protestants across Europe, including England and Scotland. The first of these were Thomas Morgan's Company of Foot a group of 300 volunteers from the London Trained Bands formed in 1572. They fought at the Relief of Goes, the defence of Delft the following year, the Siege of Haarlem and Middelburg as well as the naval victory in the Scheldt by 1574.Knight, Charles Raleigh: records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, pp. 6-9 After the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1586, the Earl of Leicester formed the Brigade by adding three English regiments to the three Scottish already serving. While Leicester's expedition was largely a political and military disaster, the Brigade existed in various forms throughout the war. After Leicester's departure Sir Francis Vere took over the position. The brigade under him endured throughout fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success. Working in close cooperation with the Dutch forces under Maurice of Nassau, the brigade, step by step helped secure the country's independence from Spain by 1597. Scottish mercenaries in the 1630s Tactical innovations in the 1580s replaced the traditional slow moving infantry squares with smaller more mobile units and introduced the concept of volley fire. This created a preference for professional troops, rather than civilian militia; both James I and Charles I viewed the Brigade as a foreign policy tool, which also provided them with a pool of trained military professionals if needed. The Thirty Years' War created multiple opportunities to serve in the armies of Protestant nations like Sweden, Norway and Denmark; Dutch service became less attractive, while the Brigade was primarily used on garrison duty.Glozier, 2001, P.128. However, strong religious, economic and cultural links between Scotland and the Netherlands meant that by 1632, the Brigade contained three Scottish and three English regiments. When the Wars of the Three Kingdoms broke out in 1638, many returned home but the Brigade continued to serve in the Dutch army until the Peace of Münster ended the war with Spain in 1648. 1648-1697 Hugh Mackay (1640-1692), who re-established the Brigade as an elite unit in the 1670s; killed at Steenkerque, 1692 In the late 17th century, the experience of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Protectorate meant strong resistance in both Scotland and England to a standing army. Formations like the Brigade thus provided an outlet for Scots and English who wanted to pursue a military career; professional officers formed a small and tight-knit group, who moved between armies, often regardless of nationality, religion or political belief. States commonly employed other nationalities; in the French army of 1672, 12 out of 58 infantry battalions were recruited outside France, as were 9 of its 87 cavalry regiments. During the 1665-1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War, officers were required to swear allegiance to the States General but many refused to do so. The English regiments were withdrawn in 1665, reinstated in 1667, then withdrawn again when the Third Anglo-Dutch War began in 1672. The alliance between England and France was deeply unpopular; while the Franco- Dutch War continued until 1678, the two countries made peace with the 1674 Treaty of Westminster. John Graham, Viscount Dundee; one of many late 17th century Scots soldiers who served with the Brigade Uncertainty and constant changes impacted recruitment and William of Orange complained about its low morale and quality; by 1674, only 13 officers in the three nominally Scottish regiments were Scots. Hugh Mackay was largely responsible for recreating the Brigade by suggesting they re-establish the regiments by recruiting from Scotland and England. Recruitment for the Brigade was controlled by Charles II and his brother James II; they also appointed the officers but this required negotiation, as shown by the failure of attempts to install the Catholic Earl of Dumbarton as commander. Nevertheless, the Brigade included a number of Catholic officers like Thomas Buchan; during the 1689-92 Jacobite rising in Scotland, senior officers on both sides included former colleagues Buchan, George Ramsay, Hugh Mackay, Alexander Cannon, Viscount Dundee and Sir Thomas Livingstone. The Brigade was lent to James in June 1685 to suppress simultaneous rebellions in Scotland and England, but both quickly collapsed and it returned to the Netherlands without seeing action. In early 1688, James demanded the repatriation of the entire Brigade but it was clear war with France was imminent and William refused to comply. The Brigade accompanied his invasion of England in November 1688; a small detachment took part in the Wincanton Skirmish on 20 November 1688, one of the few actions fought during the largely bloodless campaign. In March 1689, Hugh Mackay and the three Scottish regiments were sent to Scotland to suppress the Jacobite uprising; the three English regiments were transferred onto the English military establishment. 1701 to dissolution in 1782 The expansion of the British military during the War of the Spanish Succession led to restrictions on Dutch recruitment in Scotland and was halted entirely in 1709. Relaxed after 1714, they were re-imposed after the 1745 Jacobite Rising, due to concern rebels might use it to escape. The right to recruit in Scotland was finally ended in 1757. For most of the 18th century, the Brigade was used to man the Dutch Barrier forts. In the War of the Austrian Succession, detachments fought at Fontenoy, Rocoux and Lauffeld and held Bergen op Zoom during the 1747 siege. After it fell to the French, the garrison withdrew to Steenbergen, which they successfully defended until the war ended in 1748; by then, only 200 officers and men of the original 800 remained. The war confirmed the decline of the Dutch Republic as a major European power and it did not take part in the Seven Years' War. The Brigade remained a distinct force but long service in the Netherlands meant that by the 1760s the vast majority of recruits either came from Scottish families settled in the Netherlands for generations or were not Scottish at all. Its right to recruit in Scotland finally ended in 1757.Henshaw, p. 54 The capture of Sint Eustatius by the British led to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and the dissolution of the Brigade in 1782 The outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 caused tensions with Britain since the Dutch were generally sympathetic towards the colonists. The Dutch island of Sint Eustatius was used for trading with the US, over 2,400 ships clearing the port in 1777 alone and a British request for the 'loan' of the Scots Brigade was rejected due to requirements made by the province of Holland.Miggelbrink, McKilliop & Murdoch, 2002, p.86-88. In September 1780, the British intercepted a draft commercial treaty between the American agent in Aix-la-Chapelle and members of the Amsterdam business community and declared war in December. Since it was technically a British unit on loan whose officers held commissions from George III, this caused obvious problems when the countries were at war. On 18 November 1782, all officers were required to take an oath to the Stadholder but most refused and returned to Britain; they included a Colonel, 5 Lt-Colonels, 3 Majors, 11 Captains, 3 Lieutenants and 29 Ensigns. Distinctive markers such as red uniforms, British colours and the \\"Scottish March\\" were abolished and the units renumbered Dutch infantry Regiments Nrs 22, 23 and 24. When peace came in 1784, a combination of political and cultural changes meant the Brigade was not reformed.Miggelbrink, McKilliop & Murdoch, 2002, p.92. Legacy Sir Thomas Bradford Colonel, 94th Foot, circa 1825 Those officers who resigned their commissions in 1782 continued to petition the British government for the Brigade to be reconstituted in some form. Finally in October 1794, 23 former Brigade officers joined a new unit raised for service in India, 94th Foot, the Scotch Brigade.Miggelbrink, McKilliop & Murdoch, 2002, p.88. The 94th assumed the battle honours and colours of the Brigade until 1881 when it became part of the Connaught Rangers; the regimental colours can now be seen in St Giles', Edinburgh, with copies also in the Netherlands. Over the years many ex- soldiers settled in the Netherlands, including Hugh Mackay, whose son, nephews and grandsons all served with the Brigade. This branch ultimately became hereditary Chiefs of Clan Mackay and continue to hold the titles of Lord Reay in the Scottish peerage and Lord of Ophemert and Zennewijnen in the Netherlands. Other less distinguished descendants included Dutch Colonial Army Captain Rudolf MacLeod, who in 1895 became the husband of Mata Hari when she responded to his advertisement for a wife. In his novel The Heart of Mid- Lothian, set in the Porteous Riots of 1736, Sir Walter Scott references the brigade, as the Scotch Dutch; > Captain John Porteous, a name memorable in the traditions of Edinburgh, as > well as in the records of criminal jurisprudence, was the son of a citizen > of Edinburgh, who endeavoured to breed him up to his own mechanical trade of > a tailor. The youth, however, had a wild and irreclaimable propensity to > dissipation, which finally sent him to serve in the corps long maintained in > the service of the States of Holland, and called the Scotch Dutch.

Beginning her service to him at the age of 17 as his secretary, she quickly ascended to become entrusted with the executive decision making within Gandhi's law practice and sociopolitical movements by her early twenties. Gandhi said \\"during the Satyagraha days ... she led the movement single handed\\". She was a lifelong friend to Gandhi and would have been a fellow lawyer if she had not been female. She ended her career as a teacher of Latin and made a late attempt to become a lawyer at the age of 65. Life Born in 1888 to a Jewish family in Moscow, Schlesin moved to South Africa with her parents Isidor and Helena Dorothy Schlesin (born Rosenberg) in 1892. By the age of fifteen she had matriculated at the University of the Cape of Good Hope which was the city where her family lived. She was recommended for a job by the architect Hermann Kallenbach to a new immigrant Indian lawyer named Mohandas Gandhi. Kallenbach described her as honest and clever, but mischievous and impetuous. Gandhi was so impressed by Schlesin and her speed at shorthand that he offered her a generous wage which she turned down for a more modest figure initially suggested by Kallenbach. Schlesin told Gandhi that she wanted to work for him because she supported his work and not for the money that he was offering. Gandhi would take on large administrative and important tasks. In 1904 he persuaded the authorities to rehouse gold mine workers in the Transvaal where the pneumonic plague was taking a toll. Gandhi had taken on the problem and his legal office team had been reassigned to nursing for the sick. The workers' old houses had to be burnt and the dispossessed had only the money that they had buried for safe keeping. Gandhi became their banker and took in about £60,000. This needed to be accounted for so that he could successfully return it several years later. Schlesin, Gandhi and Kallenbach just after the Great March in 1913 In 1908 the South African government introduced the \\"Restriction Act\\" which was further legal discrimination and was known as the \\"Black Act\\". It was Schlesin who wrote a speech for herself to give to 2,500 protesters and asked her parents for permission to deliver it. In the end, it was Gandhi who delivered it, but it was Schlesin's speech that challenged the people \\"to give up all, aye very life itself, for the noble cause of country and religion\\". The Chinese community awarded Schlesin a gold watch and the Indian community gave her ten pounds. Schlesin took to smoking and wearing a collar and tie and she cut her hair short. She also included the suffragists as examples of protest in speeches she wrote. The smoking led to Gandhi slapping her when she smoked in his presence. Schesin was rewarded by Gandhi with a proposal to article her as a clerk and aspiring lawyer, but the application was rejected on the basis of Schlesin's gender. In April 1909, the High Court in Pretoria \\"declined to depart from the universal practice, which precluded the admission of ladies as attorneys…\\" In the same year Schlesin became secretary of the Transvaal Indian Women's Association because there were no educated Indian women who could take the position. Gandhi went to London that year and left his affairs confidently under the charge of Schlesin. She was entrusted with large sums of money and the trust to make executive decisions despite her age. Hermann Kallenbach, Gandhi and Sonja Schlesin and others (to the left) after his jail term in 1913 When Gopal Krishna Gokhale visited South Africa on 22 October 1912 for political discussions across the country for six weeks he was accompanied by Gandhi. Gokhale's said his primary reason for visitation was encouraging the return of Gandhi to India. Gandhi asked Gokhale to evaluate the current Indian leadership and the people he had met in South Africa. Gokhale assessment of the leaders was reportedly very accurate and noted Schlesin in particular for her outstanding talent, energy, ability and service within Gandhi's entourage. In 1913 Gandhi led striking South African miners on a great march to protest their conditions and the lack of respect shown to them. This was a bold move as Gandhi was relying on his own finances and the good will of the community to prevent the marchers from suffering hunger. The strike was staged in response to taxation specifically targeting Indian miners who refused to leave South Africa upon the completion of their employment. The support of Kallenbach and Schlesin was instrumental due to their ability to capitalize on their \\"white credentials\\" to muster support from the greater Anglo community, while further using the same status as protection from arrest and prosecution. After Gandhi left Gandhi returned to Britain in 1914 and Schlesin decided to remain in South Africa despite Gandhi's profuse thanks to her at farewell dinners in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. Schlesin enrolled at the University College of Johannesburg which she funded with a loan that Gandhi arranged. By 1924 she had earned two degrees of the first class, a Bachelor and Master of Arts, respectively, from the University of Witwatersrand. Schlesin became a well respected but eccentric teacher of Latin at a high school in Krugersdorp for over 20 years with only two students having ever failed her course. Despite this record she was never promoted and this may have been due to frictions with her faculty authorities. She stood up for her beliefs and would astound students by returning Christmas presents that were given to her. Schlesin outlived Gandhi who was assassinated in 1948. She enrolled at the University of Natal in 1953 to study law but she did not complete the curriculum presumably due to her or the ill health of her sister Rose. Schlesin died in Johannesburg in 1956 and her ashes were placed in a wall of remembrance at Braamfontein Cemetery in Johannesburg. Gandhi wrote of her in glowing terms in his autobiography noting her ability to work night and day without prejudice or favour. She worked unescorted and asked for little reward and \\"during the Satyagraha days, almost everyone of the leaders was in jail, she led the movement single handed\\".

Overview As successor of the DSC-F717, F828 was widely considered \\"revolutionary\\" at launch. Major changes / improvements over its predecessor, the 2002 F717 include: * \\"Carl Zeiss T*\\" lens with 7x (28-200mm) zoom range, wider compared to F717's 5x (38-190mm) * Mechanically-linked zoom ring * 8.0 megapixel, 2/3 inch, 4-color RGBE CCDs, highest pixel counts in any consumer camera sensors at launch. * Upgraded electronics for faster focus and post-processing. Continuous AF, and VGA- quality (640x480) filming were made possible. * Addition of a CompactFlash slot as an alternative to Sony's proprietary Memory Sticks. Although, a Memory Stick Pro is required for VGA-quality filming. * Shutter speed up to 1/3200s The F828, along with the \\"Cyber-shot F\\" series designation, was discontinued in 2005. Reception Despite having attractive on-paper specs, F828 did not fare as well as its predecessor among camera reviewers and photographers. F828 received a \\"Recommended / Above average\\" rating from DPReview, in contrast to a \\"Highly recommended\\" given to F717. Average user rating is 43 out of 100 from cameradecision.com. Visible picture noise, associated with increased pixel density and underdeveloped noise reduction algorithm, was of primary concern. Moreover, the complicated RGBE sensor did not result in better color accuracy as expected; this led Sony to drop any further development on such sensors, making F828 the first and the last camera ever to use a 4-color sensor. Many photographers also noted more severe purple fringing on F828s than on its predecessors.

It is one of the largest churches on Gotland, and dating largely from the 14th century, although the current church building was preceded by a stave church. The stone portals of the church are comparatively richly decorated. It is used by the Church of Sweden and part of the Diocese of Visby. History The earliest church at the site was a stave church, built in the early 12th century at the latest. It was later replaced by a Romanesque stone church, the tower of which still survives in the present building. The nave and choir were completely rebuilt during the 14th century to their present Gothic look. Few alterations have been made since. Several of the medieval furnishings have been removed and placed in museums, however. The altarpiece is Baroque in style and dates from the 1600s, and the pews are neo-Gothic, dating from the 1890s. Architecture The church is one of the largest on Gotland. The nave has broad bays and high vaults and is unusually monumental. Typically for churches on the island, the choir lacks an apse. The church has three richly carved portals set in the facade. The oldest is on the northern side and is probably a remnant of the older, Romanesque church. The sculpted decor dates from the 12th century and is a work by the anonymous artist Majestatis. It includes, among other things, one of the first known depictions of the Devil in Scandinavian art. The sculpted portal is considered one of the most interesting pieces of Romanesque art in present-day Sweden. The other portals are located on the south facade, and are later, Gothic pieces of sculpture. Especially the main portal displays a rich décor. The sculptures depict Christian themes, such as the life of Mary. The portals were probably made in the medieval workshop which is sometimes referred to as Egypticus. Inside, there are remains of wall paintings from the 15th century in the choir. On a wall in the tower, there is also a painted Troy Town; here is also a gravestone located which probably predates the stone church. It is a Christian gravestone, carved with runes.

Fulton Jr., M.D., (February 25, 1940 – July 4, 2013) was an American dermatologist and medical researcher who co-invented Retin-A, a popular acne medication, in 1969. Fulton co-developed tretinoin, known by the brand name as Retin-A, with Dr. Albert Kligman. Fulton was also pioneer for his use of new procedures and treatments in dermatology. He is believed to be the first dermatologist to include an aesthetician on the staff of his medical team. His inclusion of an aesthetician was initially criticized by other dermatologists, but soon earned acceptance and is now widely practiced in the field. Fulton also championed the early use of fat transfer for breast augmentation and surgical procedures to alleviate acne scars. Biography =Early life= Fulton was born on February 25, 1940, in Ottumwa, Iowa, but raised in California. His father was an executive with the Cracker Jack company. He was plagued by acne during his early life, which would lead to his choice of dermatology as a career. Fulton earned both his bachelor's degree and medical degree from Tulane University in New Orleans, where he was a collegiate swimmer as an undergraduate. =Career= In 1969, Fulton, Dr. Albert Kligman and Dr. Gerd Plewig released their study, \\"The Effect of Chocolate on Acne Vulgaris,\\" through the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study followed sixty-five participants, who suffered from moderate acne, who were given two types of candy bars to eat. One group of participants were given candy bars containing no chocolate. The second group were given bars containing more chocolate than the average candy bar at the time. The trio concluded that chocolate consumption did not contribute to acne, although the study was funded by the Chocolate Manufacturers Association. Fulton and his wife and business partner, Sara Fulton, a chemist, established Vivant Skin Care in 1990 in California. The company was relocated to South Florida in 2000. Their line of Vivant Skin Care products, which are manufactured at a facility in Miami Lakes, Florida, uses Vitamin A therapies which were patented by Fulton. Their daughter, Kelly Fulton-Kendrick, served as CEO of Vivant, as of 2013. Fulton released a 2001 book, Acne Rx: What Acne Really Is And How To Eliminate Its Devastating Effects, in which he detailed he experience as both a researcher and a patient. In the book, Dr. Fulton called acne \\"complicated, mysterious and devious disease, the treatment is remarkably simple and control is finally possible.\\" The book earned him appearances on the talk show circuit, including ABC's The View. =Personal life= Fulton died of colon cancer on July 4, 2013 at Mercy Hospital in Miami, Florida, at the age of 73. A resident of Key Biscayne, Florida, he was survived by his wife, Sara Fulton, and their four children, Kelly Fulton- Kendrick, Susan Fulton-Arregui, James E. Fulton III, and George J. Fulton. Fulton had met his wife Sara while he was a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and was working as an anatomy teacher in Penn's nursing department. Sara first saw Fulton in an elevator and faked a rash to obtain an appointment with him. They married during lunch on February 2, 1970, and then returned to their labs after the ceremony to continue their research for the rest of the day. Fulton and his wife raised four children in Newport Beach, California. They continued to own a home in Newport Beach from 1975 to 2004. References [Vivant Skin Care Co-founder James E.

Throughout the 1970s, Kim Joo-young wrote works driven by strong satirical impulse directed against results of modernization in Korea. In many of these vignettes, the snobbery of urban people are contrasted with wholesome humanity of country-folk; when transplanted into the brutal atmosphere of the cities, these simple people are forced to become devious in order simply to survive.

Hereof you are not to fail on pain of amerciament. High Bailiff \\".'Summons to Southwark Courts Leet', issued from the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey, 9 July 2013 On the appointed day, the Court is assembled, the Jurors are sworn in and they name their Foreman and he names a Constable, an Affeeror, a Flesh Taster and Ale Conners, who take their oaths. The Affeeror, 'a-fee-rs', ie prices the fines; the Ale Conners and the Flesh Taster are appointed to test the quality and measure of beers and meats, ie check weights and measures. Some note on terminology of the Manor may help at this point by analogy with the practice of Livery Companies:- Foreman = Master; Sworn Officers = Wardens; Tithing = Court of Assistants; Tithingmen = Assistants who have served as Foreman. The High Bailiff then reads the Riot Act (from an original King’s Printers Copy without which it has no proclamatory validity) and the High Steward then delivers his ‘charge’ to the Jury. After this the Foreman states any ‘presentments’, ie the cases he wishes to present. There have been none since the early Victorian period. The High Steward, being such an eminent jurist, then gives a talk (a ‘charge’ to the Jury) on some historical matter or an issue of some current legal concern and controversy and the Court then adjourns to allow the Jurors to continue in a convivial way entertaining their guests and the Old Bailey officers to a festive meal. This arrangement of the City’s Law Officers Swearing the Jurors (‘freemen’) and Foreman with Officers/ Tithing (‘Master and Wardens’) is unique in the City, unlike the Liveries and guilds which Swear their own Freemen and Courts of Assistants. The City’s authority in Southwark in relation to its manors there dates from 1327, considerably pre-dating most of the livery companies foundations. However, it is the Manor’s officers which conduct all ceremonial in the Borough and not (as in the City) the Guildhall officials.  History  The members of the ‘Guildable Manor’ are the Free Tenants or Burgesses of the ‘Town and Borough of Southwark\\" which is the title given to it in the Charter granted to the City by Edward VI in 1550.Johnson op cit p325 - 35 The original burh of Southwark (ſuðringa geƿeorce)Listed in the Burghal Hidage. was founded by Alfred the Great ca 879-886 as part of a system of 33 forts to defend the kingdom of Wessex and English Mercia from the Vikings (see Burghal Hidage).'Mediaeval Southwark' Hambledon Press 1999, Martha Carlin p16. These forts had become by the late tenth century settlements and towns in which there where markets, tradesmen/ craftsmen and a mint. The denizens had certain rights within the feudal system which meant they were ‘free’ of manorial obligations, indeed they began to exercise within their settlements what were effectively manorial rights of a ‘lord’. Apart from trade and administrative control the ‘freemen’ or burgesses (burh members) also dispensed local justice and this too grew from an early Anglo- Saxon procedure of the frið-borh. This was the ‘peace-oath’, which required all freemen to pledge by oath to uphold the peace of the realm. They did this by binding each other in mutual cogniscence, usually in an assembly of a tenth part, a ‘tything’, of a ‘hundred’ (a subdivision of a shire with a taxable value of a hundred hides). This procedure is prefigured in King Alfred’s law codes by an arrangement called the gegilden and references to tenth century ‘frith gilds’.'Mediaeval Southwark' Hambledon Press 1999, Martha Carlin pp. 18-22 The clearest proof of the ancient status of the Southwark free-tenants is their first written appearance; this is in Domesday Book compiled in 1086 for William I ‘the Conqueror’. This was a national record of account to list what was owed to the king by his tenants in chief, his fellow Norman conquerors and the senior Prelates of the Church, whom were the greatest landholders. These in turn had sub-let to others, so that ownership and duties, either food-rents or military services, had become confused as to who owed them, the tenant in chief or the under-tenant. The king therefore sent his commissioners across the nation to interrogate these to provide evidences, they also asked the king’s local agent in the shires or counties to confirm these statements, the ‘shire-reeves’. These sheriffs could not know everything, but they could ask the local freemen on oath to announce their opinion of this information. The point is that the freemen could express the truth in the knowledge of royal protection from the wrath of local magnates. In the sections of Domesday Book in regard to this manor, the ‘Men of Southwark’ are shown as doing this.'Southwark' in Domesday Book In 1326 the City was allied to the cause of Queen Isabella and Mortimer to remove Edward II and replace him with his juvenile son as Edward III. In doing so the City was rewarded with the maintenance and extension of its privileges at the first Parliament of the new reign in March 1327 and granted associated charters to authorise some major Livery Companies and to grant the Crown's interest in Southwark to the City for the fee or tax farm, the City thereafter appointing the Bailiff who was now responsible to the City as 'Lord of the Manor'. The charter of 1327 is still extant and held at Guildhall.David Johnson, Southwark and the City (Oxford University Press, 1968) p16  Quit Rents and Court of Exchequer  The Charter granted to the City of London by Edward III to take control of the ancient borough and manor ('ville of Southwark' alias Guildable Manor) was specific in that an annual render of cash had to be made to the Crown's treasury, the Exchequer. In Domesday Book the value of Southwark to the king was noted as £16.00, there is some evidence that the render was for £10.00 in the early period but it eventually settled at £11.00, the differences may have been related to fee or tax farming.David Johnson, Southwark and the City (Oxford University Press, 1968) p16 p16 Each year, usually near the Charter date of 6 March, this Quit Rent is made at a ceremonial Court of Exchequer of the Queen's Remembrancer. The Remembrancer instructs the Attorney to the City of London as Clerk of the Court (post held by the Director of the City Remembrancer's department at Guildhall) to summons the free burgess tenants of the Guildable Manor, in their capacity as the representatives of the City in Southwark, to the Court as jurors to make the payment.Summons from QR at RCJ dated 10 February 2013. They then travel to Southwark to institute the Court. The jurors attend and stand witness to their Foreman and Officers presenting the rental, doing so by placing 44 Crowns, i.e. five shilling (now 25 pence) pieces onto the Exchequer Cloth, this represents the £11.00. The Clerk to the Chamberlain's Court of the City also attends to inform his superior that the rent for Southwark has indeed been paid and the City's obligations to the Crown fulfilled. Although largely now decorous the ceremony underlies the fact that the City Bridge House Estate & Lands committee is in fact the largest land-owner in the area. The Estate pays the annual Jurors Fee; the Chamberlain's office pays the actual rent along with many others to the Crown.David Johnson, Southwark and the City (Oxford University Press, 1968) p405 The event has been held in a number of dignified venues over the years, the Cathedral Library, Glaziers Hall, Guy's Chapel but most often in recent years at St George the Martyr Southwark.

Description The state reserve provides saltmarsh feeding habitat for orange-bellied parrots on their migration route between south-west Tasmania and southern Victoria The state reserve occupies much of the coast at the north-eastern end of the island, extending from Lake Martha Lavinia and Penny’s Lagoon in the north to the estuary of the Sea Elephant River in the south. It contains swamps, long sandy beaches and coastal heathlands, protecting the largest remaining block of native vegetation on King Island. History Reservation of land in what is now the state reserve began in 1959 with the gazettal of the 510 ha Sea Elephant River Wildlife Sanctuary; it was incorporated with additional land to the north in 1971 with the proclamation of the Lavinia Sanctuary. In 1978, land consisting of the Lavinia Nature Reserve and the Sea Elephant Wildlife Sanctuary was listed in the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. In 1983 a 1730 ha area around the Sea Elephant estuary was listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, being only the fifth Australian site to be so designated. In 1994 the Ramsar site boundary was realigned and extended to correspond with those of the current nature reserve. In 2001, land previously reserved under the name Lavinia Nature Reserve and some associated \\"reserved land in the class of nature reserve under section 21(1) of the Regional Forest Agreement (Land Classification) Act 1998\\" was declared as the Lavinia State Reserve. The name derives from the 52-ton schooner Martha Lavinia, wrecked on a reef offshore in 1871 near what is the site of the state reserve while carrying a cargo of potatoes from Tasmania to Adelaide, which gave its name to several features along the north-eastern King Island coast. Flora and fauna =Flora= The state reserve contains three heathland communities: swamp paperbark dry heath, coastal tea tree heath and scented paperbark wet heath. : The vulnerable scrambling ground fern is present. In the past frequent fuel-reduction burning has led to much woody vegetation being replaced by bracken and tussock grassland. Saltmarsh abuts the Sea Elephant estuary. =Fauna= The state reserve provides habitat for many birds and other animals, including the critically endangered orange- bellied parrot, the extremely rare King Island subspecies of the brown thornbill, and the Southern Hairy Red Snail.

Participants who volunteer to join their cause will shave their heads bald. It is the only head-shaving event in Singapore and through this gesture, Hair for Hope aims to accomplish the following goals as mentioned below: # Create awareness of childhood cancer in Singapore # Show children with cancer and their families that they are not alone in their fight against cancer # Tell children with cancer that it is OK to be bald # Raise funds and help children with cancer and with their families # Build a community of support for children with cancer and their families Hair for Hope believes every shaven head symbolizes the understanding of the difficulties faced by a child with cancer. The act of shaving helps to increase awareness of childhood cancer and also presents itself as a chance to amass monetary support from the public. Origin In 2003, 9 Children's Cancer Foundation volunteers decided to shave their heads to help garner support for children with cancer during Tulip Hearts Day, an annual Children's Cancer Foundation fundraising event, with the help of Lush Hair Creation’s hair stylists. $2000 in donation was raised towards Children's Cancer Foundation. The idea for Hair for Hope was born. On 27 August 2004, Hair for Hope was officially launched involving 73 volunteers raising up to $48,000 for Children's Cancer Foundation beneficiaries. Works Being an initiative of the Children’s Cancer Foundation, Hair for Hope began in 2004. Hair for Hope has both raised money for the Children’s Cancer Foundation’s beneficiaries and increased awareness for the foundation as well as Children’s Cancer. Participants garner pledges for the cause with many individuals and groups signing up to give their support for the cause. They then have their heads shaven at the annual event typically held at the end of July. Hair for Hope also partners with many organisations who support the event through providing participants as well as other means. Hair from volunteers are also used to make wigs to raise funds too. Having grown beyond a single event, there are now many satellite events held under the Hair for Hope banner. These events are organised by both public and private organisations and are non-concurrent to the main event. Venues are usually provided free by the organisers and hair salons, such as Jean Yip Group and Next Hair Salon, provided their services for free also. Hair for Hope established the Hair for Hope Facebook page and Twitter account in April 2011 and Instagram account, more recently, in November 2014. Tapping into these social media outlets has allowed Hair for Hope to extend its reach with over 9,000 likes on Facebook and over 100 followers on Twitter and Instagram. Reception Since its inception in 2003 with only nine volunteers to shaving their heads and raising S$2,000 for the event, it has grew to 6656 shavees and achieved more than S$3.29 million in 2014. It has branched out and reached an unprecedented number of 53 satellite events organized by 33 corporate offices, 13 schools and 7 grassroot organization. In 2011, the event saw 547 females shave their heads, out of the 4238 shavees. Controversy In 2013, three out of five St Margaret’s Secondary School female students, who took part in the Hair for Hope, attended school without wearing wigs as promised to their school administration. They were then instructed by their principal to wear a wig to school. They were then accompanied by a parent volunteer to buy a wig. This drew criticism from netizens on the principal’s actions as this goes against the spirit of Hair for Hope. After discussions with the school administration and the girls, the Education Minister at the time, Heng Swee Keat announced that the students will not have to wear a wig.

Born in a small town in Norway, Rieber became a seaman at the age of 15. By 1904, he was the master of an oil tanker, which was bought the next year by the newly founded Texas Company, or Texaco. He rose steadily through the ranks to become chairman in 1935. The next year he arranged for Texaco to buy the Barco oil concession in Colombia. Over the next three years he oversaw the major engineering feat of opening the remote oilfield and building a pipeline through rugged and jungle-covered terrain to the Caribbean coast. Rieber was sympathetic to the fascist regimes in Europe in the 1930s and illegally supplied oil on credit to Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. He also purchased tankers from Germany in exchange for oil. The last tanker was delivered from Hamburg after the outbreak of World War II. For a while, Texaco continued to ship oil to Germany via South America. When Rieber's ties to the Nazis were revealed in August 1940, there was a scandal and he was forced to resign. Rieber continued in the oil industry. Iran nationalized British oil holdings in 1951, but following the 1953 Iranian coup d'état that restored the Shah to power, Rieber negotiate the dispute. Early years Bayonne oil storage facilities in 1970 Rieber was born in Voss, Norway, on March 13, 1882, son of the owner of a dye works in a small town about from Bergen. His family was Lutheran, and he was brought up in an environment where alcohol, dancing and gambling were strictly forbidden. At the age of 15 Rieber left home and joined the full-rigged sailing ship Hiawatha on a six-month voyage around Cape Horn to San Francisco. On return to Norway he attended a school for sailors, and then found work for two years as quartermaster on a barkentine ferrying indentured Indian laborers from Calcutta to British sugar plantations in the West Indies. In 1901, aged 18, he was in command of a French sailing tanker when he was injured in a shipboard fight while docked in Delaware Bay. He was hospitalized and lost his command. After recovering, Rieber found a position as mate on a Texan oil tanker, the first to leave Texaco's Spindletop facility in Texas. In 1904 he became master of the vessel. Rieber's tanker was bought by the three-year-old Texaco in 1905. After three more years at sea, he was given the job of building a terminal for Texaco at Bayonne, New Jersey. The terminal came into operation before it was complete, and the wooden buildings twice burned down. Rieber arranged for them to be quickly rebuilt. Rieber was then assigned to the company's head office. Rieber married Miriam Marbe in 1909. They had two children, a girl and a boy. Miriam died in 1938. During World War I (1914–1918) he was superintendent of terminals and assistant superintendent of the oil refinery at Port Arthur, Texas. The first boss of Texaco, Joseph Stephen Cullinan, fell out with Texaco's directors in 1913 and left to form another oil company, American Republics Corporation. After World War I ended, Rieber left Texaco and became a vice-president at Cullinan's new company. The company struggled to get organized, and in 1927 Rieber accepted an offer to return to Texaco as vice president in charge of exports and marine transportation. He acquired a fleet of new tankers and opened up markets around the world for Texaco. In 1929 and 1930 he tried unsuccessfully to reach an agreement with Heath Eves of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later to become British Petroleum) for the two companies to cooperate in Europe or other markets where BP did not have a partner. In 1935 he was appointed chairman of Texaco, with William Starling Sullivant Rodgers as president. Rieber featured on the cover of Time magazine on 4 May 1936. Barco oil concession Barco oil concession and pipeline to Coveñas In the 1930s Texaco was the fourth largest oil company in the United States, after Standard Oil of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum and Standard Oil of Indiana, but relied completely on domestic oil fields. Rieber wanted other sources of supply in case the United States banned exports to one or all of Texaco's foreign customers. In 1936 Rieber bought the Barco oil concession in Colombia from Gulf Oil for $14,550,000, and sold a half interest to Socony-Vacuum, now Mobil. The crude oil had to be pumped over the Cordillera Oriental across a pass. From there the line ran west through the low-lying Magdalena River valley, in three places running under the river or one of its tributaries. The pipeline terminated at the Caribbean port of Coveñas in the Sucre department. The pipe was designed to be able to carry 28,000 barrels per day from the La Petrólea and Tibú fields. Most of the equipment and supplies were carried by air, a total of , landed on airstrips hacked out of the jungle. This included a suspension bridge long as well as vehicles, power plants, plumbing and food. At its peak, 5,000 local workers were employed, supervised by 400 Americans. Eight employees of the oil companies were killed by Motilone Indians defending their territory. 62 wells were operational when the pipeline was opened in 1939. The crude was gold- green in color and yielded 49% gasoline on straight-run refining, a very high value. The last weld in the pipeline was made by Gladys Crosby Whitney, wife of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Total costs to develop the field and the pipeline were $40,000,000. Ties to Spanish and German fascists  First oil well in Bahrain in 1931 Standard Oil of California had acquired the rights to the Bahrain oilfield in the Persian Gulf and was seeking a partner with market presence in the far east. Rieber made an agreement for joint production with the new California-Texas Oil Company, which also took over Texaco's far eastern market. In 1939, the jointly owned subsidiary returned a total of $12 million to its parents. In common with many other business leaders, Rieber admired the efficiency of the fascist movements in Europe. The Spanish Civil War erupted in July 1936. Under the January 1937 Neutrality Act, it was illegal to provide credit to either side;Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939, Adam Hochschild, Pan Macmillan Rieber met General Francisco Franco in August 1936 and agreed to supply the Nationalists with oil on credit until the war ended. Neither was it legal for American ships to transport cargo to Spain; yet Texaco ships ostensibly bound for Antwerp, Rotterdam, or Amsterdam were given sealed orders, which diverted them to Spain. The oil was still priced as though Francoist Spain had transported it. Customs agents discovered the scheme, causing a political scandal. In June 1937, President Roosevelt met Rieber and threatened to embargo future shipments. Texaco was fined $22,000. However, Rieber continued the shipments. He directed his associate at the Paris Texaco office, William M. Brewster, to relay to the Nationalists intelligence on the Spanish Loyalists, such as fuel amounts, cost, and type. In total, Texaco delivered to the Nationalists 3.5 million tons of oil for a total of $20 million. For his service, Rieber was given the title of Knight of the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by Franco. In 1936, Rieber commissioned several oil tankers from the Deutsche Werft shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, in return for oil. The Skandinavia tanker was not complete before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Although the United States was neutral, the Germans did not want to release a tanker that could be used to supply their enemies. Rieber flew to Berlin to negotiate with the German naval officials. He was successful, and Admiral Erich Raeder allowed the tanker to sail under the flag of Panama to ship oil to neutral countries. In December 1939, Rieber and Hermann Goering made a tour of factories in Germany. They were flown by Pete Clausen, a Pan American Airlines pilot. Rieber continued to ship Colombian oil to Germany, despite the British embargo. According to a German secret service report, Rieber was \\"absolutely pro-German ... a sincere admirer of the Führer.\\" Rieber met Field Marshal Hermann Göring in 1940 and was given a message from Hitler to President Roosevelt, inviting him to support Berlin's plan for a European Union, led by Germany, which would open its doors to the United States. Roosevelt rejected the offer. Rieber also talked with the German agent Gerhardt Alois Westrick, who was gathering information about American armaments and intentions concerning the European war. After the fall of France, Westrick threw a celebratory party at the Manhattan Waldorf Astoria hotel on 26 June 1940, attended by senior executives of IT&T;, General Motors and Ford as well as by Rieber. Westrick posed as a trade official and made much of the huge trade potential with the new German empire once Britain had been defeated, which would soon be accomplished. Westrick also met with Rieber at his head office in the Chrysler Building. The British secret service disclosed this to the American press, causing an uproar. Publicity about Captain Rieber's pro-Nazi views began to threaten Texaco's sales. After a stormy meeting in August 1940, the Texaco board of directors forced Rieber to resign. In July 1940, Life Magazine had published a lengthy profile of Rieber. Reporting his resignation in the 26 August 1940 issue, Life portrayed him as an innocent victim whose only errors had been to dine with Westrick and lend him a Texas Co. car. Torkild Rieber had already aided the German Navy in finding ships of Texaco heading for the UK. Life Magazine did not know that. Later career Abadan Petrochemical Complex in 1970 Rieber became president of the independent Barber Oil Company after he left Texaco. In March 1951 the Iranian parliament voted to nationalize the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), triggering the Abadan Crisis. The APOC withdrew its employees, and under pressure from Britain other countries embargoed Iranian oil. The Iranians asked for help from the World Bank to resolve the dispute, and the idea was floated that the bank might run the Iranian oil industry in the interim. The World Bank assigned Rieber to assist Hector Prud'homme in examining the oil installations in Iran. The two men arrived in Iran on 31 December 1951 and met prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh the next day, giving him a message from Robert Garner of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development before going on to inspect the facilities at Abadan. In February 1952 Rieber was part of a larger World Bank mission sent to negotiate an arrangement for restarting oil production pending agreement with the British over ownership of the assets. One sticking point was that the Iranians would not allow British oil technicians to return, and it would not be practical to find sufficient technicians from other countries. The main obstacle was the British demand for revenue sharing. In 1953 the British and Americans sponsored a coup that restored the western-oriented but autocratic Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in place of the elected government. Rieber became adviser to the new Iranian government, and assisted them in their negotiations in 1954 with a consortium of Standard Oil of New Jersey, Royal Dutch Shell and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His influence may be seen in the eventual settlement. In 1963 Rieber attended a fortieth anniversary celebration of Time magazine hosted by the publisher Henry Luce at the Waldorf Astoria, attended by many of the people that had been featured on the magazine's cover over the years. He died in Manhattan on August 10, 1968, aged 86.

He was called 'Big Jim' and 'the uncrowned King of New Zealand' in recognition of the considerable influence he wielded during the period of the First Labour Government over policy creation and implementation. Early life He was born in Lissangle, County Cork, Ireland, in 1878 and arrived in New Zealand in 1901 or 1902. His first years in New Zealand were spent struggling to find stable employment before finding a job with the Wellington Gas Company. He married Lucy Wallace on 22 February 1912, with whom he was to have six children. Lucy became deaf during her third pregnancy and later developed rheumatoid arthritis leaving her largely invalided. His job with the Wellington Gas Company saw him join the union and briefly became its president. As a result, he became active in the Wellington Socialist Party, which Roberts and Robert Hogg kept from joining the local United Labour Party under the \\"unity scheme\\" in 1912. He was then opposed to political activity and the Labour Party, and challenged the primacy of the Labour parliamentarians. He was secretary of the New Zealand Waterside Workers Federation from 1915 to 1941 and the Alliance of Labour from 1920 to 1935. Political career Roberts became one of the dominant figures of the Labour Party, serving as vice-president from 1934 to 1936, and national president between 1937 and 1950. Roberts created a collaborative relationship between the Labour Party and trade unions during the tenure of the First Labour Government. Little of the industrial legislation passed by Labour went without his input and scrutiny. He occupied the chair during Labour's annual conferences and chaired the session at the 1940 conference which approved the expulsion of John A. Lee, whom Roberts was opposed to. Roberts sought the nomination for the Wellington West electorate ahead of the 1938 general election, but was unsuccessful. In 1944 he stood for Mayor of Wellington, but was defeated by Will Appleton. The election saw all Labour candidates defeated as well. He was appointed to the Legislative Council from 17 June 1947 to 31 December 1950, being nominated by the Labour Government. Following the Legislative Council's abolition, he was elected a member of the Wellington City Council in 1950. He was re-elected in 1953 and 1956, but was defeated in 1959. He was elected to the Wellington Harbour Board in 1953. He served two terms before he was defeated in 1959. Following the defeat of the Labour government at the 1949 general election, Roberts was defeated for the party presidency by his perennial opponent for the position Arnold Nordmeyer, ending a record 13 year presidency. Roberts was elected as vice-president, holding the office until 1954. Later life and death Roberts was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, in recognition of his services as secretary of the New Zealand Waterside Workers' Federation and the Alliance of Labour. Roberts died in Porirua in 1967, survived by four daughters and a son. His wife had died in 1944.

Opposition activists attributed the massacre to the jihadist group Al-Nusra Front – then al-Qaeda's main Syrian branch – and the Ansar al-Khilafa Brigade, and said that 51 government soldiers who had surrendered had been executed. Government media said that Islamists including the al-Khalifa Brigade had killed 123 people, the majority of them civilians. Background Rebels had for months tried to take Khan al-Assal, a strategically located town in the west of Aleppo province. It finally fell into rebel hands on 22 July, but fighting continued on its edges the next day, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). During the clashes, a captured T-55 tank was seen in use by the rebels. At least 150 Syrian army soldiers died in the fighting with rebels for the control of the town in the northern Aleppo province. Khan al-Assal had been the site of the Khan al-Assal chemical attack on 19 March 2013, which the government claimed was carried out by rebels, and the rebels claimed was carried out by the government. Massacre According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an opposition group, 51 Syrian soldiers were executed by rebels after the fall of Khan al-Assal, while another hundred had died during the battle.

Etymology  The name Podmaine (Pod-Maine) means \\"beneath Maine\\". Maine was a small tribe with territory below Lovćen, between Stanjevići Monastery and Budva. The monastery was the gathering place of the tribe, who traditionally held meetings on the feast day of St. George.  History  The exact year of establishment of the monastery is unknown. The church of Dormition of the Mother of God was built in the 15th century and reconstructed in 1630 while its larger church (Church of St. Petka) was built in 1747. Metropolitan Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš died in Podmaine Monastery in 1735. He was buried in the monastery but his remnants were later moved to Cetinje. Dositej Obradović lived several months in this monastery when he visited Boka in 1764. In 1830 Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, based on the request of the emperor of Russia, sold Podmaine Monastery and Stanjevići Monastery together with their estates to the Austrian Empire. Njegoš wrote parts of his masterpiece The Mountain Wreath in Podmaine Monastery.  Frescoes  Controversial fresco Frescoes in the Church of St. Petka were painted by Rafail Dimitrijević from Risan in 1747 and Nicholaos Aspioti from Corfu. The monastery was burned down in 1869. In the 1979 earthquake the monastery was significantly damaged and in 2002 it was completely rebuilt and new frescoes were painted in the smaller church (dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God). According to some views one of the frescoes titled Sinful bishops and emperors () presents a former Yugoslav leader Tito and heads of the uncanonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church as damned and handed over to devils who herd them down into hell in a modern version of the Last Judgment.

It stars Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Octavia Spencer, Holly Hunter, Iliza Shlesinger and Kathleen Rose Perkins and was released October 18, 2013. The title is a take on the fact that while many tourists visit the Las Vegas Strip they are actually spending most of their time in the town of Paradise rather than in the actual city of Las Vegas. This was the last film by Mandate Pictures before it was shut down. Plot Lamb Mannerhelm goes to speak at her family's church in Montana one year after surviving a plane crash, which has left her with severe burns all over her body. While everyone is expecting her to make some big announcement, she instead publicly denounces her belief in God, causing a major uproar in the church. Lamb later explains some of the strict rules she has to live by in her conservative town, like listening only to Christian music, and not being allowed to wear pants. Feeling both angry and inexperienced in life, Lamb heads to Las Vegas to indulge in the sinful pleasures that are objected in her community as she sees surviving the plane crash as a second chance at life and time for her to now live life on her own terms. Once there, she goes to a random bar in order to have her first drink, where she meets a bartender named William, and a singer named Loray.

With the help of his son, John Buttrick Jones, he continued his work preaching, translating religious books, and serving as an advocate for the Cherokees. One author claims that Evan and his son \\"...converted more American Indians to Christianity than any other Protestant missionaries in America\\".  Life in North Carolina  Jones had been an adherent of Methodism in Wales, but converted to the Baptist church soon after he arrived in Philadelphia. He became a Baptist missionary and was sent to Valley Town, North Carolina, where he taught at the Baptist mission school. Among his pupils were the future Cherokee missionary, Jesse Bushyhead and a future chief of the Cherokee tribe, Lewis Downing. Jones' wife died at Valley Town on February 5, 1831. Their son, John Buttrick Jones, was born December 24, 1824. He also had a daughter, Mary Lincoln Jones, who was born in 1835 in the Eastern Cherokee Nation, North Carolina.https://www.ancestry.com/family- tree/person/tree/154557571/person/412040774255/facts Evan married Pauline Cunningham after Elizabeth's death. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma, Jones was accused of committing adultery with her. He was also accused of murdering his sister-in-law, Cynthia Cunningham, and her baby, thus granting him the dubious distinction of being the first clergyman to be tried for murder in the United States. He was tried by a civil court and a church council and was acquitted in both. Jones soon found that many of the older Cherokees, especially those who lived in the mountains, clung tenaciously to their old ways and culture. He wrote in his journal that people he called \\"conjurers\\" (actually, they were the adoniskee or medicine menMcLoughlin, The Cherokees and Christianity. p. 68) would spread rumors that the Europeans had furnished the Bible to lead the Cherokees astray from their old religion. They collected the prayer books and hymnals that Jones had given out and returned them to the mission. Sometimes they even threatened Jones with bodily harm. Jones persisted and, over time, these same people came to develop a tolerance for him and his work, while he exhibited a tolerance for their old ways.Minges, p. 44. Jones and Bushyhead developed a close working relationship as missionaries, with Jones often preaching in English and Bushyhead translating the sermon into Cherokee.Foreman, Carolyn Ross. \\"Aunt Eliza of Tahlequah.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 9, No. 1 (March, 1931). Retrieved June 19, 2013. In 1832, Reverend Jones recommended to the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions that Bushyhead be appointed as an assistant missionary. The appointment was made, and Bushyhead served in this role for the next eleven years. He is said to have been the first Cherokee to have been ordained as a Baptist minister. He continued to work closely with Jones, not only preaching to the Cherokees, but translating the Book of Genesis and other religious books into the Cherokee language, using the Cherokee Syllabary.Hirschfelder, Arlene, and Paulette Molin. \\"Bushyhead, Jesse.\\" Encyclopedia of Native American Religions, Updated Edition. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2000. American Indian History Online. Facts On File, Inc.  Cherokee removal  Jones vehemently opposed the removal of the Cherokees from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern United States to the Indian Territory. Unable to prevent their expulsion, he volunteered to lead one group of the tribe on the Trail of Tears. His group comprised 1,033 people, who left Valley Town on February 2, 1838, just ahead of another group led by Jesse Bushyhead. Jones' group experienced 71 deaths and five births en route. After their arrival in Indian Territory, Jones set about reconstituting the Baptist Mission school near the present town of Westville, Oklahoma. Jones named the site Pleasant Hill. The Cherokees called it \\"Breadtown\\", because the Army issued food rations there after the trek.Routh, E. C. \\"Early Missionaries to the Cherokees.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 15, No. 4. Retrieved July 20, 2013.  Life in Indian Territory  Jesse Bushyhead died in 1844, but Evan Jones kept the Pleasant Hill mission going until the Civil War. John Buttrick Jones joined his father in this work in 1855. John had graduated from the University of Rochester and married there earlier that year. The mission had acquired a printing press and the Joneses began publishing a monthly newspaper called the Cherokee Messenger. The paper was printed partly in Cherokee and partly in English.First Baptist Church - Tahlequah, OK. History. Retrieved July 26, 2013. In 1856, the Joneses helped organize a secret anti-slavery organization, the Keetoowah Society, among the full-blood Cherokees, to counter the influence of a secret pro-slavery group. The members vowed to elect anti- slavery candidates to tribal office and to keep the Cherokee Nation neutral in case war broke out between the American states over the slavery issue. Although their meetings were held in the woods with traditional dances and debates, they always opened with prayers by Cherokee Baptist preachers.McLoughlin, The Cherokees and Christianity. p. 82 The pro-slavery faction on the Cherokee Council tried to pass a law in 1857, threatening missionaries with expulsion from the Cherokee Nation if they opposed slavery. The law did not pass, but the full-bloods' anger against the pro-slavery mixed bloods only grew. Evan Jones faced new competition when the Southern Baptist Convention began sending pro-slavery missionaries into the Nation in 1857.McLoughlin, After the Trail of Tears, p. 147 When the Indian Agent Butler learned about the Keetoowah Society, he informed Alfred B. Greenwood, commissioner of Indian Affairs. Greenwood ordered that the Society be broken up and its leaders arrested. This order never succeeded. In 1861, the U.S. Indian Agent forced John B. Evans to leave the territory, claiming that he was \\"an intemperate abolitionist.\\" The younger Jones spent the Civil War in Illinois. A year later, Evan Jones also fled from pro-slavery vigilantes who threatened his life.The Cherokees and Christianity\\", p. 68 Evan and John Jones both returned to the Cherokee Nation shortly after the Civil War ended. They, like those of other denominations, began to work rebuilding their churches, reactivating former members and recruiting new members. Although they were instructed not to interfere in tribal politics, Evan became a supporter of Lewis Downing, who many full-bloods wanted as Principal Chief, instead of William P. Ross, who had been appointed by the Council.McLoughlin, After the Trail of Tears, pp. 243-246 John B. Jones moved the mission to Tahlequah, which had become the Cherokee capital, in 1867.  Death and legacy  Evan Jones retired from all mission work in 1870. He died August 18, 1872. Pauline died September 17, 1876. Both are buried in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The American Baptist Magazine memorialized Evan Jones, saying: > He was a man of scholarly attainments and acquired the Cherokee language and > spoke and wrote it freely. The confidence in which he was held among the > Cherokees who venerated him as a father, was never impaired. Even in the > hours of his last illness, they came from far and near to hear a few last > words of comfort in their native tongue from their revered friend. For the > last three years he resided at Chetopa, Kansas, at the home of a daughter, > and was on a visit to his son at Tahlequah at the time of his death. He was > sick only a few days. The previous Sabbath he attended church and heard his > son preach.  References   Sources  * McLoughlin, William G. After the Trail of Tears: The Cherokees' Struggle for Sovereignty. 1993.

He won major races in four countries including the Gran Premio del Jockey Club in Italy, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in France, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in the United Kingdom and the Grosser Preis von Baden in Germany. He was rated the fifth-best racehorse in the world and was voted German Horse of the Year for his performances in 2013. Background Novellist is a dark bay or brown horse with a white snip and three white socks bred in Ireland by his owner Christoph Berglar. He was sired by Monsun (1990–2012), a dual winner of the Preis von Europa who went on to become a highly successful breeding stallion. His other progeny include Manduro, Stacelita and Shirocco. Novellist's dam Night Lagoon won the Preis der Winterkönigin in 2003. The colt was sent into training with Andreas Wohler at Ravensberg, between Dortmund and Hanover. In his early races Novellist was ridden by the Panamanian jockey Eduardo Pedroza. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= On his only appearance as a two-year-old, Novellist contested a minor race over 1500 metres at Düsseldorf and won by eight lengths from five opponents. =2012: three-year-old season= Novellist made his three-year-old debut over 1600 metres at Hoppegarten. He started at odds of 1/5 in a field of nine and won by five lengths. On 6 May he was moved up in class for the Group Three Frühjahrs Dreijährigen-Preis over 2000 metres at Frankfurt. Pedroza restrained the colt at the back of the field before moving up to challenge for the lead in the straight. He took the lead 300 metres from the finish and accelerated clear of his opponents to win by six lengths. On 10 June, Novellist was moved up to Group Two class for the Union-Rennen over 2200 metre at Cologne. In a repeat of his tactics at Frankfurt, Pedroza held up the colt among the backmarkers before moving forward in the straight. In the closing stages he broke clear of the field and won in \\"very impressive\\" style by five lengths. On 2 July Novellist started 4/6 favourite for the Group One Deutsches Derby at Hamburg. He took the lead inside the last 100 metres but was overtaken and beaten half a length by the 25/1 outsider Pastorius. Wohler said afterwards: \\"Novellist ran a good race, but he was a bit phlegmatic today\\", while Berglar, said: \\"That's racing!\\". After a two-month break, Novellist was matched against older horses for the first time in the Grosser Preis von Baden. Ridden by the British-based Norwegian-born jockey William Buick, he finished fourth of the seven runners behind Danedream, Ovambo Queen and Pastorius. On his final start of the season, Novellist was sent to Italy to contest the Gran Premio del Jockey Club over 2400 metres in Milan. He started 8/13 favourite and won easily by four and a half lengths from the Australian-bred Retrieve. =2013: four-year-old season= Novellist made his first appearance as a four-year-old in the Grosser Preis der Badischen Unternehmen over 2200 metres at Baden-Baden on 12 May. He won by a head from the 2011 Deutsches Derby winner Waldpark, to whom he was conceding six pounds. On 23 June, Novellist was sent to France for the Group One Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Ridden by Ryan Moore he took the lead 400 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Dunaden, with the favourite Cirrus des Aigles in fifth place. Commenting on his colt's victory, Wohler said: \\"That was great. He had a perfect run round and Ryan even said he got to the front a little bit too soon. Even though he was in front sooner than he wanted to be, he finished well and we are very happy.\\" Novellist was then sent to the United Kingdom to contest Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. The colt was racing on firm ground for the first time but Wohler had no doubts about Novellist's ability to cope, saying: \\"He is a very good- moving horse, and his action was impressive in the gallop. If the ground is fast on Saturday, that is not really a concern. I expect him to run well\\". He was ridden by the veteran Irish jockey Johnny Murtagh after Ryan Moore was claimed to ride the three-year-old Hillstar. Novellist the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Cirrus des Aigles, Trading Leather and Hillstar. He was settled in fourth place as fast pace was set by Ektihaam and Universal, before moving up to take the lead in the straight. He accelerated clear of the field and won easily by five lengths from Trading Leather in a course record time of 2:24.6.Was für eine Titelverteidigung! Novellist mit Bahnrekord auf Danedreams Spuren (German) The win was the second successive win in the race for Germany, following Danedream in 2012. After the race Wohler said \\"I used to come to Ascot to watch the King George as a kid on my holidays, now I'm here winning it. One of our strengths is we have horses who mature later and when stepped up in distance. I was confident as I knew he had improved since his last race but I didn't expect him to win by five lengths.\\" Wohler went on to indicate that the colt would next appear in the Grosser Preis von Baden before running in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Murtagh called the winner \\"a very high-class horse with a good engine\\" and said that his only difficulty came when attempting to pull the horse up after crossing the finish line. Novellist reappeared in the Grosser Preis von Baden on 1 September and started the 3/10 favourite against four opponents. He led from the start and pulled had against Pedroza's efforts to restrain him before he was overtaken by his stable companion Seismos at half way. He regained the lead from Seismos inside the last 200 metres to win by three-quarter of a length. Novellist was strongly fancied for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but was ruled out on the day before the race when he was found to be running an abnormally high temperature. Stud career Novellist was retired from racing in October 2013 and was sold to the Shadai Corporation. He currently stands at the Shadai Stallion Station in Hokkaido, Japan. His 2015 stud fee was ¥4,000,000. Assessment In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Rankings, Novellist was given a rating of 118, making him the 89th best racehorse in the world and the fourth best three-year-old colt trained in Europe behind Camelot, Pastorius and Encke. In the 2013 edition of the rankings, Novellist was rated the best four-year-old in the world, the best male horse in Europe and the fifth-best horse of any age or sex behind Black Caviar, Treve, Wise Dan and Orfevre.

He has served in politics since the early 1980s, including six terms between the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. Corral also specializes in communications and has a long career as a columnist and founder of various publications; he also was instrumental in the successful constitutional challenge that struck down the Televisa Law.  Early life and education  Corral was born on 2 August 1966 in El Paso, Texas, United States but spent much of his childhood across the border in Ciudad Juárez; in a 2016 interview, he noted that \\"although I was born on the other side of the border, I am 100 percent juarense\\". His mother, Socorro Jurado Ríos, sought to protect her children by giving birth to them in the United States. Javier was named for Javier Solís, an actor who had died several months before his birth. In 1978, Corral's mother died when a gas tanker exploded on the Mexico City-Querétaro highway and killed 200 people; by this time, she was selling jewelry and clothing in order to support her six children, and she had already separated from Corral's father. At the age of 11, Corral worked for El Diario de Juárez newspaper and was referred to as \\"the kid journalist\\".Micrositio: Javier Corral Jurado , Diario.mx, 22 February 2016 In 1979, he traveled to the White House to receive the International Youth Journalism Award from President Jimmy Carter. Not long after, Arnoldo Cabada de la O, then an employee at XEJ-TDT, invited him to work on his newscast; when Cabada had a falling out with station owner Pedro Meneses Hoyos, Corral followed Cabada to the new XHIJ-TDT.  Early work  Corral's career in public service began in the early 1980s, inspired by sermons he heard from Bishop Manuel Talamás Camandari while he served as an altar boy. He joined the National Action Party (Partido Acción Nacional, PAN) in 1982 — a political decision that caused him to split from Cabada and leave XHIJ — and served brief stints as the Director of Public Relations and Press for the public services unit of the Chihuahua Municipality, then as the Chief of Press for the public safety unit of the municipality.Profile at the Legislative Information System From 1982 to 1983, he served as Secretary General of the Chihuahua State Association of Journalists. In the PAN, he assisted candidates for municipal President of Ciudad Juárez. In 1985 and 1986, he founded and directed two publications: Ya es tiempo (It's Time), the official magazine of the PAN candidacy for Governor of Chihuahua in 1986, and a protest magazine, El Cincel.  Chihuahua legislature  His first candidacy for elected office was in 1991 when he ran for federal deputy, which he lost. The next year, Corral was elected to the LVII Legislature of Chihuahua. There, he presided over the Justice and Human Rights and Editorial Matters Commissions. Two years after his term ended, he was elected as a federal deputy to the LVII Legislature; he would serve twelve of the next fifteen years as deputy and senator in Congress. In the LVII Legislature, he presided over the Radio, Television and Film Commission, sat on two other commissions, and served as the deputy coordinator of culture, communication and relations for the PAN parliamentary group in the chamber. Corral then served as Senator during the LVIII and LIX Legislatures; he presided over the Communications and Transportation and Rules and Parliamentary Practices Commissions. He sat on seven other commissions in his six-year term, including Border Matters, Special for State Reform, and the bicameral commission that governs Canal del Congreso. While in the LIX Legislature, Corral completed his undergraduate degree in law and social sciences at the Universidad de Occidente in Los Mochis, Sinaloa. In May 2006, a group of 47 senators headed by Corral, Manuel Bartlett Díaz and César Raúl Ojeda Zubieta presented a constitutional challenge to the recently passed Televisa Law before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. In August 2007, the court declared the law invalid. His confrontational stance against traditional broadcasters continued; in 2007, the Federal Electoral Tribunal cleared Corral of responsibility over a debt of 1 million pesos allegedly owed to Televisa stemming from advertising time bought during his 2004 run for governor. In 2009, Corral returned to the Chamber of Deputies in the LXI Legislature, presiding over the Government Commission and serving on four others, including Radio, Television and Film. That same year, he taught at the UNAM as a graduate professor of information rights.

Singular traces are a feature of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces such as the space of square-summable sequences and spaces of square-integrable functions. Linear operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space have only the zero functional as a singular trace since all operators have finite rank. For example, matrix algebras have no non-trivial singular traces and the matrix trace is the unique trace up to scaling. American mathematician Gary Weiss and, later, British mathematician Nigel Kalton observed in the infinite-dimensional case that there are non-trivial singular traces on the ideal of trace class operators. Therefore, in distinction to the finite-dimensional case, in infinite dimensions the canonical operator trace is not the unique trace up to scaling. The operator trace is the continuous extension of the matrix trace from finite rank operators to all trace class operators, and the term singular derives from the fact that a singular trace vanishes where the matrix trace is supported, analogous to a singular measure vanishing where Lebesgue measure is supported. Singular traces measure the asymptotic spectral behaviour of operators and have found applications in the noncommutative geometry of French mathematician Alain Connes. In heuristic terms, a singular trace corresponds to a way of summing numbers a1, a2, a3, ... that is completely orthogonal or 'singular' with respect to the usual sum a1 \\\\+ a2 \\\\+ a3 \\\\+ ... . This allows mathematicians to sum sequences like the harmonic sequence (and operators with similar spectral behaviour) that are divergent for the usual sum. In similar terms a (noncommutative) measure theory or probability theory can be built for distributions like the Cauchy distribution (and operators with similar spectral behaviour) that do not have finite expectation in the usual sense.  Origin  By 1950 French mathematician Jacques Dixmier, a founder of the semifinite theory of von Neumann algebras, , thought that a trace on the bounded operators of a separable Hilbert space would automatically be normal up to some trivial counterexamples. Over the course of 15 years Dixmier, aided by a suggestion of Nachman Aronszajn and inequalities proved by Joseph Hersch, developed an example of a non-trivial yet non-normal trace on weak trace-class operators, disproving his earlier view. Singular traces based on Dixmier's construction are called Dixmier traces. Independently and by different methods, German mathematician Albrecht Pietsch (de) investigated traces on ideals of operators on Banach spaces. In 1987 Nigel Kalton answered a question of Pietsch by showing that the operator trace is not the unique trace on quasi-normed proper subideals of the trace-class operators on a Hilbert space. József Varga independently studied a similar question. To solve the question of uniqueness of the trace on the full ideal of trace-class operators, Kalton developed a spectral condition for the commutator subspace of trace class operators following on from results of Gary Weiss. A consequence of the results of Weiss and the spectral condition of Kalton was the existence of non-trivial singular traces on trace class operators . Also independently, and from a different direction, Mariusz Wodzicki investigated the noncommutative residue, a trace on classical pseudo-differential operators on a compact manifold that vanishes on trace class pseudo-differential operators of order less than the negative of the dimension of the manifold.  Definition  A trace φ on a two-sided ideal J of the bounded linear operators B(H) on a separable Hilbert space H is a linear functional φ:J → ℂ such that φ(AB) = φ(BA) for all operators A from J and B from B(H). That is, a trace is a linear functional on J that vanishes on the commutator subspace Com(J) of J. A trace φ is singular if φ(A) = 0 for every A from the subideal of finite rank operators F(H) within J.  Existence and characterisation  Singular traces are characterised by the spectral Calkin correspondence between two-sided ideals of bounded operators on Hilbert space and rearrangement invariant sequence spaces. Using the spectral characterisation of the commutator subspace due to Ken Dykema, Tadeusz Figiel, Gary Weiss and Mariusz Wodzicki, to every trace φ on a two-sided ideal J there is a unique symmetric functional f on the corresponding Calkin sequence space j such that for every positive operator A belonging to J. Here μ: J+ → j+ is the map from a positive operator to its singular values. A singular trace φ corresponds to a symmetric functional f on the sequence space j that vanishes on c00, the sequences with a finite number of non-zero terms. The characterisation parallels the construction of the usual operator trace where :::: {\\\\rm Tr}(A) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\mu(n,A) = \\\\sum \\\\mu(A) for A a positive trace class operator. The trace class operators and the sequence space of summable sequences are in Calkin correspondence. (The sum ∑ is a symmetric functional on the space of summable sequences.) = Existence = A non-zero trace φ exists on a two-sided ideal J of operators on a separable Hilbert space if the co-dimension of its commutator subspace is not zero. There are ideals that admit infinitely many linearly independent non-zero singular traces. For example, the commutator subspace of the ideal of weak trace-class operators contains the ideal of trace class operators and every positive operator in the commutator subspace of the weak trace class is trace class. Consequently, every trace on the weak trace class ideal is singular and the co-dimension of the weak trace class ideal commutator subspace is infinite. Not all of the singular traces on the weak trace class ideal are Dixmier traces. = Lidskii formulation = The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. Lidskii's formula extends this result to functional analysis and states that the trace of a trace class operator A is given by the sum of its eigenvalues, :::: {\\\\rm Tr}(A) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\lambda(n,A) = \\\\sum ( \\\\lambda(A) ). The characterisation () of a trace φ on positive operators of a two-ideal J as a symmetric functional applied to singular values can be improved to the statement that the trace φ on any operator in J is given by the same symmetric functional applied to eigenvalue sequences, provided that the eigenvalues of all operators in J belong to the Calkin sequence space j. In particular, if a bounded operator A belongs to J whenever there is a bounded operator B in J such that for every natural number n, then for each trace φ on J there is a unique symmetric functional f on the Calkin space j with where λ(A) is the sequence of eigenvalues of an operator A in J rearranged so that the absolute value of the eigenvalues is decreasing. If A is quasi-nilpotent then λ(A) is the zero sequence. Most two-sided ideals satisfy the property (), including all Banach ideals and quasi-Banach ideals. Equation () is the precise statement that singular traces measure asymptotic spectral behaviour of operators. = Fredholm formulation = The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. In functional analysis the corresponding formula for trace class operators is :::: {\\\\rm Tr}(A) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\langle A e_n , e_n \\\\rangle = \\\\sum (\\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle A e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty ) where { en }n=0∞ is an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the separable Hilbert space H. Singular traces do not have an equivalent formulation for arbitrary bases. Only when φ(A)=0 will an operator A generally satisfy :::: \\\\varphi(A) = {\\\\rm f} (\\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle A e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty ) for a singular trace φ and an arbitrary orthonormal basis { en }n=0∞ . The diagonal formulation is often used instead of the Lidskii formulation to calculate the trace of products, since eigenvalues of products are hard to determine. For example, in quantum statistical mechanics the expectation of an observable S is calculated against a fixed trace-class energy density operator T by the formula :::: \\\\langle S \\\\rangle = {\\\\rm Tr} (ST) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\langle S e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\lambda(n,T) = v_T(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle S e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty ) where vT belongs to (l∞)* ≅ l1. The expectation is calculated from the expectation values ⟨Sen, en⟩ and the probability ⟨Pn⟩ λ(n,T) of the system being in the bound quantum state en. Here Pn is the projection operator onto the one-dimensional subspace spanned by the energy eigenstate en. The eigenvalues of the product, λ(n,ST), have no equivalent interpretation. There are results for singular traces of products. For a product ST where S is bounded and T is selfadjoint and belongs to a two-sided ideal J then :::: \\\\varphi(ST) = {\\\\rm f}( \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle S e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\lambda(n,T) \\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty) = v_{\\\\varphi,T}( \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle S e_n , e_n \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty ) for any trace φ on J. The orthonormal basis { en }n=0∞ must be ordered so that Ten μ(n,T)en, n0,1,2... . When φ is singular and φ(T)1 then vφ,T is a linear functional on l∞ that extends the limit at infinity on the convergent sequences c. The expectation ⟨S⟩ φ(ST) in this case has the property that ⟨Pn⟩ 0 for each n, or that there is no probability of being in a bound quantum state. That :::: \\\\langle S \\\\rangle = \\\\text{\`\`limit at infinity} \\\\langle S e_n , e_n \\\\rangle has led to a link between singular traces, the correspondence principle, and classical limits,.  Use in noncommutative geometry  The first application of singular traces was the noncommutative residue, a trace on classical pseudo-differential operators on a compact manifold that vanishes on trace class pseudo-differential operators of order less than the negative of the dimension of the manifold, introduced Mariusz Wodzicki and Victor Guillemin independently . Alain Connes characterised the noncommutative residue within noncommutative geometry, Connes' generalisation of differential geometry, using Dixmier traces. An expectation involving a singular trace and non-trace class density is used in noncommutative geometry, Here S is a bounded linear operator on the Hilbert space L2(X) of square-integrable functions on a d-dimensional closed manifold X, Trω is a Dixmier trace on the weak trace class ideal, and the density D−d in the weak trace class ideal is the dth power of the 'line element' D−1 where D is a Dirac type operator suitably normalised so that Trω(D−d)1. The expectation () is an extension of the Lebesgue integral on the commutative algebra of essentially bounded functions acting by multiplication on L2(X) to the full noncommutative algebra of bounded operators on L2(X). That is, :::: \\\\int M_f = \\\\int_X f(x) \\\\, dx . where dx is the volume form on X, f is an essentially bounded function, and Mf is the bounded operator Mf h(x) = (fh)(x) for any square-integrable function h in L2(X). Simultaneously, the expectation () is the limit at infinity of the quantum expectations S → ⟨Sen,en⟩ defined by the eigenvectors of the Laplacian on X. More precisely, for many bounded operators on L2(X), included all zero-order classical pseudo-differential operators and operators of the form Mf where f is an essentially bounded function, the sequence ⟨Sen, en⟩ logarithmically converges and :::: \\\\int S = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{1}{1+k} \\\\langle S e_k , e_k \\\\rangle}{\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{1}{1+k}} These properties are linked to the spectrum of Dirac type operators and not to Dixmier traces; they still hold if the Dixmier trace in () is replaced by any trace on weak trace class operators.  Examples  Suppose H is a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. = Ideals without traces = * Bounded operators. Paul Halmos showed in 1954 that every bounded operator on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is the sum of two commutators. That is, Com(B(H)) B(H) and the co-dimension of the commutator subspace of B(H) is zero. The bounded linear operators admit no everywhere defined traces. The qualification is relevant; as a von Neumann algebra B(H) admits semifinite (strong-densely defined) traces. Modern examination of the commutator subspace involves checking its spectral characterisation. The following ideals have no traces since the Cesàro means of positive sequences from the Calkin corresponding sequence space belong back in the sequence space, indicating that the ideal and its commutator subspace are equal. * Compact operators. The commutator subspace Com(K(H)) K(H) where K(H) denotes the compact linear operators. The ideal of compact operators admits no traces. * Schatten p-ideals. The commutator subspace Com(Lp) Lp, p > 1, where Lp denotes the Schatten p-ideal, :::: L_{p} = \\\\\\\\{ A \\\\in K(H) : \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\mu(n,A)^p \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, :and μ(A) denotes the sequence of singular values of a compact operator A. The Schatten ideals for p > 1 admit no traces. * Lorentz p-ideals or weak-Lp ideals. The commutator subspace Com(Lp,∞) Lp,∞, p > 1, where :::: L_{p,\\\\infty} = \\\\\\\\{ A \\\\in K(H) : \\\\mu(n,A) = O(n^{-\\\\frac{1}{p}}) \\\\\\\\} :is the weak-Lp ideal. The weak-Lp ideals, p > 1, admit no traces. The weak-Lp ideals are equal to the Lorentz ideals (below) with concave function ψ(n)n1−1/p. = Ideals with traces = * Finite rank operators. It is checked from the spectral condition that the kernel of the operator trace Tr and the commutator subspace of the finite rank operators are equal, ker Tr = Com(F(H)). It follows that the commutator subspace Com(F(H)) has co-dimension 1 in F(H). Up to scaling Tr is the unique trace on F(H). * Trace class operators. The trace class operators L1 have Com(L1) strictly contained in ker Tr. The co-dimension of the commutator subspace is therefore greater than one, and is shown to be infinite. Whilst Tr is, up to scaling, the unique continuous trace on L1 for the norm A1 = Tr(A), the ideal of trace class operators admits infinitely many linearly independent and non-trivial singular traces. * Weak trace class operators. Since Com(L1,∞)+ (L1)+ the co-dimension of the commutator subspace of the weak-L1 ideal is infinite. Every trace on weak trace class operators vanishes on trace class operators, and hence is singular. The weak trace class operators form the smallest ideal where every trace on the ideal must be singular. Dixmier traces provide an explicit construction of traces on the weak trace class operators. :::: {\\\\rm Tr}_\\\\omega(A) = \\\\omega \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log(1+n)} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\lambda(k,A) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\right), \\\\quad A \\\\in L_{1,\\\\infty} . :This formula is valid for every weak trace class operator A and involves the eigenvalues ordered in decreasing absolute value. Also ω can be any extension to l∞ of the ordinary limit, it does not need to be dilation invariant as in Dixmier's original formulation. Not all of the singular traces on the weak trace class ideal are Dixmier traces. * k-tensor weak trace class ideals. The weak-Lp ideals, p > 1, admit no traces as explained above. They are not the right setting for higher order factorisations of the traces on the weak trace class ideal L1,∞. For a natural number k ≥ 1 the ideals :::: E_{\\\\otimes k} = \\\\\\\\{ A \\\\in K(H) : \\\\mu(n,A) = O (\\\\log^{k-1}(n)/n ) \\\\\\\\} :form the appropriate setting. They have commutator subspaces of infinite co-dimension that form a chain such that E⊗k-1 ⊂ Com(E⊗k) (with the convention that E0 = L1). Dixmier traces on E⊗k have the form :::: {\\\\rm Tr}^k_\\\\omega(A) = \\\\omega \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log^k(1+n)} \\\\sum_{j=0}^n \\\\lambda(j,A) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\right), \\\\quad A \\\\in E_{\\\\otimes k} . * Lorentz ψ-ideals. The natural setting for Dixmier traces is on a Lorentz ψ-ideal for a concave increasing function ψ : [0,∞) → [0,∞), :::: L_{\\\\psi} = \\\\\\\\{ A \\\\in K(H) : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\psi(1+n)} \\\\sum_{j=0}^n \\\\mu(n,A) < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}. :There are some ω that extend the ordinary limit to l∞ such that :::: {\\\\rm Tr}^\\\\psi_\\\\omega(A) = \\\\omega \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\psi(1+n)} \\\\sum_{j=0}^n \\\\lambda(j,A) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\right), \\\\quad A \\\\in L_{\\\\psi} :is a singular trace if and only if :::: \\\\liminf_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\psi(2n)}{\\\\psi(n)} = 1 . :The principal ideal generated by any compact operator A with μ(A)=ψ' is called the 'small ideal' inside Lψ. The k-tensor weak trace class ideal is the small ideal inside the Lorentz ideal with ψlogk. * Fully symmetric ideals generalise Lorentz ideals. Dixmier traces form all the fully symmetric traces on a Lorentz ideal up to scaling, and form a weak* dense subset of the fully symmetric traces on a general fully symmetric ideal. It is known the fully symmetric traces are a strict subset of the positive traces on a fully symmetric ideal. Therefore, Dixmier traces are not the full set of positive traces on Lorentz ideals.

He played a major role in inter-Christian rivalries in the Sasanian empire.  Biography  Gabriel was born in Sinjar to a Syrian Miaphysite. According to one account he became a court physician after curing the sterility of the shah's favourite wife. The shah's wife, Shirin, later converted to the Syriac Orthodox Church under Gabriel's influence. Shirin also influenced by Gabriel, tried to replace Dyophysitism (Church of the East) with Miaphysitism as the official form of Christianity in the Persian empire. Gabriel convinced the shah to prohibit the Church of the East from appointing a new leader after the death of its Catholicos, Gregory. He also tried to exploit the fragmentation of the Church of the East in order to weaken it: he convinced Khosrau II to convene a disputation at his court between Miaphysites and Dyophysites, knowing that the Church of the East would have to produce a formula of faith that would not be universally accepted by all its bishops. In the 612 disputation, Babai the Great presented the Sassanids' first clear and \\"official\\" Miaphysite christology which did as expected cause schisms amongst members of his church. During the disputation George of Izla, a Zoroastrian convert to the Church of the East, objected to Gabriel's expulsion of Dyophysite monks from their monasteries. Gabriel retaliated by accusing George of apostasy from the state religion, which caused the latter's execution by the Sasanian authorities. Gabriel of Sinjar die not long after. Eventually, as the Sasanians suffered defeat at the hands of the Byzantines, the Miaphysites too fell out of favour and Christians of all sects were persecuted.

A smart lock is an electromechanical lock which is designed to perform locking and unlocking operations on a door when it receives such instructions from an authorized device using a wireless protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. It also monitors access and sends alerts for the different events it monitors and some other critical events related to the status of the device. Smart locks can be considered part of a smart home. Most smart locks are installed on mechanical locks (simple types of locks, including deadbolts) and they physically upgrade the ordinary lock. Recently, smart locking controllers have also appeared at the market. Smart locks, like the traditional locks, need two main parts to work: the lock and the key. In the case of these electronic locks, the key is not a physical key but a smartphone or a special key fob configured explicitly for this purpose which wirelessly performs the authentication needed to automatically unlock the door. Smart locks allow users to grant access to a third party by means of a virtual key. This key can be sent to the recipient smartphone over standard messaging protocols such as e-mail or SMS. Once this key is received the recipient will be able to unlock the smart lock during the time previously specified by the sender. Smart locks are able to grant or deny access remotely via a mobile app. Certain smart locks include a built-in Wi-Fi connection that allows for monitoring features such as access notifications or cameras to show the person requesting access. Some smart locks work with a smart doorbell to allow the user to see who and when someone is at a door. Smart locks may use Bluetooth Low Energy and SSL to communicate, encrypting communications using 128/256-bit AES.  Security  Due to the inherent complexity of digital and wireless technologies, it can be difficult for the end user to confirm or refute the security claims of various product offerings on the market.

He was mainly remembered for his role in a royal disputation which eventually led to his execution.  Early life  Mihramgushnasp appears to have been born in the village of Paqōrya d'Benšbail in Mesopotamia in the late 6th century. He was raised Zoroastrian in a noble dehqan family. His father Babai was the ōstāndār (official in charge of crown property) of Nasibin, his grandfather had held the prefecture of Weh Antiok Khosrow near Ctesiphon. His mother was the daughter of a Magian mowbed (high priest). Mihramgushnasp received his education in Zoroastrian religious rituals and Persian literature, and by the age of seven he learned to recite the Yashts and perform the Barsom. He later married his sister Hazaroe which was a common practice among aristocratic Magians.  Conversion  The late Sasanian period saw an increase of conversions from Zoroastrianism to Christianity. It seemed that the Church of the East directed their missionary efforts at the Sasanian ruling class in hopes of Christianising the empire, as had been the case with the Roman Empire. Mihramgushnasp and his sister-wife, known later by her Christian name \\"Maria\\", were among the aristocratic converts. He apparently left his family to marry a Christian wife, and informed her family of his intentions to be baptised. He succeeded in convincing his sister of converting as well, and together they announced their conversion by desecrating the holy fire, deliberately seeking martyrdom. However they were not executed, and he left for a monastery in Mount Izla, Tur Abdin in 601, where he received his Christian education alongside Babai the Great, one of the most influential theologians of the Church of the East.  Disputation and death  George of Izla participated in several debates with Zoroastrians. His knowledge of the Avesta gave him an edge over his rivals. The most famous disputation in which he took part was a debate between members of the Church of the East and the Miaphysite Syriac Orthodox Church, convened by the Sasanian king Khusraw Parviz in 612 at the royal court in Ctesiphon. The Church of the East delegation was headed by George of Izla while Gabriel of Sinjar, the Shah's physician, led the Miaphysites. Later sources claim that George won the debate. In retaliation Gabriel brought up George on charges of apostasy from Zoroastrianism, a crime punishable by death in Sasanian law. George was judged and convicted of apostasy. He was crucified in the straw market in Veh- Ardashir In 615.

He was one of the founding members and early chiefs of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He was killed in a 1981 bombing in Tehran. Early life Born in Najafabad in 1944, Montazeri was the oldest son of Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri. He had two brothers and two sisters. Career and activities Montazeri was a low-ranking and radical cleric. He began opposition activities to the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the June 1963 events that led to the exile of Khomeini. His father and he were both arrested by the Shah's security forces in March 1966. In prison Mohammad was tortured and released in 1968. He left Iran for Pakistan. Then he settled in Najaf, Iraq, in 1971 and stayed there until 1975. Next he lived in Afghanistan and in other cities of Iraq. He headed an armed group that was based in Syria and Lebanon and fought against Israeli forces. The group was founded by Montazeri and Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur with the aim of assisting liberation movements in Muslim countries. Montazeri was trained in Fatah camps in Lebanon. In addition, he fought with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian and Shiite armed groups in the country. Montazeri was one of the three Iranian key officials along with Mostafa Chamran and Mohtashamipur who strengthened Iran's commitment to Lebanon. He was called Abu Ahmad by Lebanese people. Montazeri also travelled to Europe during this period. In 1978 he occupied the Mehrabad airport of Tehran with his 200 armed followers and demanded to go to Libya to search for Musa Al Sadr, a Lebanese Shia cleric who disappeared in Libya in August 1978. He visited Ayatollah Khomeini when the latter was in exile in Paris. Before the 1979 Iranian revolution he was one of the people who promoted the idea of founding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. During the revolutionary process, he was called \\"Ayatollah Ringo\\" and \\"Red Sheikh\\". In order to export Islamic revolution to other countries he and Mehdi Hashemi founded one of the earliest groups, the Revolutionary Organization of the Masses of the Islamic Republic (SATJA) in the spring of 1979. In December 1979, he organized a campaign to support and join the Palestinian militants. fighting in the Lebanese civil war. His activities in the Satja caused conflicts with the government and he was forced to disband it. Then he and Hashemi joined the Guards. Montazeri headed a faction of the Guards in Tehran that functioned as a strong arm of the Supreme Leader Khomeini. It was called Freedom Movements Unit. In 1981 this faction was transformed into the office of liberation movements (OLM) which was firstly led by him and after his death, by Hashemi. An account with the name liberation movements was opened in the Melli Bank to get financial support from Iranians. The OLM put into practice the Iranian support for the Shi‘a movements in Iraq and the Gulf as well as those in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Afghanistan. At the founding and institutionalization phase of the Guards Montazeri became a member of the Revolutionary Guards Leadership Council in 1979 which was formed by the Revolutionary Council to oversee the future tasks of the Guard. He publicly declared in 1980 that the IRGC personnel \\"were awaiting deployment from Damascus.\\" Montazeri joined and led the Muslim People's Republic Party and became a member of the first Majlis in March 1980. On the other hand, his party was disbanded after its members were either arrested or executed. In addition, Montazeri served at the supreme defense council and was the prayer leader in Tehran until his death. =Views= Montazeri was one of the most radical followers of Ayatollah Khomeini. Before the Iranian revolution he was close ally of Moammar Qaddafi and advocated strong ties with Libya. And, he did not support the approach of the Amal movement and Musa Al Sadr, because it was non-revolutionary. Montazeri was also a fierce critic of the interim government led by Mahdi Bazargan due to the same reason. Both Montazeri and his father actively encouraged the rebellion of Shia Muslims against the governments in the Muslim countries and also, strongly argued for the export of the Islamic regime to other countries, often called \\"Islamic Internationale\\". The latter goal was mostly achieved through the OLM, and it is one of two pillars of ideology guided the revolution along with the propagation of Islam. In addition, he argued that all Muslims could enter Islamic states without passport or visas. Montazeri also supported for the development of links with Shia Muslims in Lebanon. He tried to make Iran a key player in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Just three days before his death, he argued for the execution of the ousted prime minister Abolhassan Bani Sadr's followers. =Controversy= At the initial phase of the Iranian revolution the activities of the Montazeri's group, Satja, led to tensions between Montazeri and both the Guards's leadership and the provisional government. His father, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, publicly reprimanded him and stated that Mohammad had poor mental health because he had been tortured by the former Shah's secret police. Eventually, elder Montazeri disassociated himself from his son’s activities. Mohammad Montazeri was part of the Libya-friendly group in the court of Khomeini and there was a feud between his group and the faction, called \\"Syrian mafia\\", led by Sadegh Ghotbzadeh. Ghotbzadeh's faction was called previously the Liberation Movement of Iran (LMI), and Mostafa Chamran was also part of it. In addition, Montazeri had serious disagreements with Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, cofounder of the Islamic Republican Party. Death Montazeri was killed in a bombing at the central headquarters of the then ruling party, Islamic Republican Party, in Tehran on 28 June 1981. The Islamic Republic of Iran suspected various organizations and individuals, including SAVAK, the Iraqi regime, the People's Mujahedin of Iran, the United States, royalist army officers, and \\"internal mercenaries\\". It also executed 4 Iraqi agents and Mehdi Tafari for the incident. The death toll in the attack was 73, including Behesti, cabinet ministers and the members of the Majlis. A state funeral was held for the victims on 30 June and a week of mourning was proclaimed. Montazeri was buried in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine in Qom where his father would also be buried on 21 December 2009. Legacy A street in Qom was named after him, Martyr Mohammad Montazeri boulevard.

Moe Berg, the subject of the book, was an enigmatic person who hid much of his private life from those who knew him and who spent his later decades as a jobless drifter living off the good will of friends and relatives. The book spent seven weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, which described the biography as \\"The life of Moe Berg, big-league catcher, O.S.S. agent, lady's man, and freeloader.\\" Book summary =Early years= Berg was born in 1902 to a Jewish couple that lived in New York City, not far from the Polo Grounds, the home of the New York Giants baseball team. His father, Bernard Berg, was a pharmacist who emigrated from Ukraine in part to escape from what he considered to be the oppressive nature of an almost entirely Jewish village. Berg's mother, Rose Tashker, was also a Ukrainian Jew. She was engaged to Bernard prior to his emigration. The couple, along with their three children lived in the Harlem section of New York City until 1906 when Bernard Berg bought a pharmacy in West Newark, New Jersey.Dawidoff, pages 19-22 Subsequently, the family moved to the Roseville section of Newark. Berg began playing baseball at the age of seven and, to the dismay of his father who did not understand American sports, continued through his high school years. After his high school graduation, Berg enrolled in New York University but eventually transferred to Princeton University and for the remainder of his life, always associated himself with Princeton, ignoring his time at NYU.Dawidoff, 29 Always an excellent student, Berg studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Sanskrit and subsequently received a B.A. in modern languages. During his student years at Princeton, Berg played first base and shortstop. Although he was not a good hitter and was a slow baserunner, his fielding, arm strength, and knowledge of the game led to his being appointed as team captain in his senior season.Dawidoff, 30-34 His performance at Princeton caused both the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers to express interest in him, and after graduation Berg accepted a $5,000 contract offered to him by the Dodgers.Dawidoff, 36-37 =Professional baseball career= Berg's career as a professional baseball player spanned 16 years, most of it spent as a journeyman backup catcher for the Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, and Boston Red Sox. Berg also spent time at the minor league level playing for the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, and the Reading Keystones of the International League. During the early part of his career, Berg attended Columbia Law School, causing him to miss several weeks of spring training for the White Sox. Berg eventually graduated in 1930 and passed the New York Bar Exam, but his absence from spring training resulted in him being benched in favor of other players. Notably, Berg visited Japan on two occasions during his baseball career. His first trip was arranged by Herb Hunter and was intended to teach baseball at Japanese universities during the winter of 1932. After the instruction was completed, Berg remained behind to explore Japan. He then visited Manchuria, Shanghai, Peking, Indochina, Siam, India, Egypt and Berlin. Berg's ability to learn languages rapidly helped him greatly in his travels.Dawidoff, 77-81. Berg's second trip to Japan came about in 1934 when Hunter arranged for a group of all-stars to play against Japanese teams. Although Berg was only a backup catcher, his proficiency in the Japanese language resulted in his joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Jimmie Foxx on the team. Prior to his departure from the United States, Berg contracted with MovietoneNews, to film the sights of his trip. As part of that effort, he took along a movie camera which he used with great success in surreptitiously filming industrial and military facilities in Japan during the trip. The film footage proved to be valuable as the increasingly militarized Japan had restricted the movement of foreigners and made it extremely difficult for outsiders to gather intelligence.Dawidoff, 87–93. By the time Berg's career was coming to an end, he had gained a reputation as one of the game's smartest players, and was a favorite of newspaper reporters who enjoyed writing the storyline of the Princeton language scholar and New York lawyer who was also a big league catcher. But the final years Berg spent as a player, and then a coach, for the Red Sox caused both teammates and reporters to raise questions about his actual role with the team. Aside from giving foreign language lessons to members of the bullpen, he was unusually quiet and reserved and did little more than help warm up pitchers who were about to enter the game. Berg himself only batted 33 times during the 1939 season. \\"Not a lot of pep or vinegar\\" is how he was described by Ted Williams who was one of Berg's young teammates.Dawidoff, 118-119 =Berg's role as a spy in World War II and the years following= Berg was 39 years old when the United States entered World War II, and at that age believed the best contribution he could make to the war effort was to use his language skills to further the Allied cause. Using his numerous connections, Berg was offered a position with the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in 1942. His duties included traveling to South America, where he inspected the living conditions of soldiers manning remote outposts while guarding against an attack on the Americas by the Axis powers. Berg's reputation as a ballplayer, along with his legal training and foreign language skills enabled him to move effortlessly between troops, general officers, diplomats, and foreign politicians.Dawidoff, 127–138 However, Berg soon began looking for ways to make a more pivotal contribution to the war effort and decided to apply for a position with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). His application was acceptedDawidoff, 151–157 and subsequently, he spent the majority of his time in Europe, performing a variety of missions, many of them related to Germany's work on nuclear energy and atomic weapons. One of Berg's missions involved a trip to neutral Switzerland where he was to attend a lecture German physicist Werner Heisenberg was giving in Zürich. Berg's orders were to determine if Heisenberg's work with nuclear energy was assisting the Germans in developing a nuclear bomb. If Berg determined that it was and that the Germans were close, he was to kill Heisenberg. Berg attended the lecture, armed with a pistol, but determined that Heisenberg's efforts and Germany's progress in the developing a weapon were overstated. Later, Berg befriended Heisenberg, and along with his other work both in Switzerland and later in Italy, helped convince U.S. military officials that Germany was not on the verge of developing an atomic bomb.Dawidoff, 191–207 Moe Berg, professional baseball player =Later years= Despite his law degree and offers to coach in the major leagues, Berg opted to live with his brother, Dr. Samuel Berg, in New Jersey and spend the remainder of his life unemployed, living off the good will of friends and family. When people asked Berg what he did for a living, he would slowly draw his finger to his lips as if to silence both the question and answer, giving the impression that he was still involved in spying, which he was not.Dawidoff, pages 252 and 312 Popular with men of influence and considered a womanizer, over the years Berg began making some people, especially women and small children, uncomfortable. On at least two occasions, Berg may have touched or fondled small children in a sexual manner.Dawidoff, pages 264 and 282 After 17 years of living with his brother, Berg was told to leave and find another place to live. He eventually moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained for the rest of his life.Dawidoff, 316 In May 1972, Berg was hospitalized after a fall. His condition worsened as doctors could not identify the cause of his decline which was eventually diagnosed as an aortic aneurism. On May 29, 1972, Berg died. His last words were in the form of a question to his nurse: \\"How are the Mets doing today?\\" He died before she could answer.Dawidoff, 328–329 Ethel Berg buried her brother's ashes in a cemetery outside of Newark. Sam, Berg's brother, visited the grave yearly until his sister became gravely ill in 1986 and revealed to him that she had dug up the urn containing Berg's ashes in 1974 and had taken them to Israel for burial. She had entrusted the urn to a rabbi who buried Berg's remains on Mount Scopus, overlooking Jerusalem, but she could not remember exactly where. > \\"For years, Dr. Sam tried to learn where the grave was located so that Berg > could be brought home and be buried with his family. But the rabbi could not > tell him. Dr. Sam died in 1990 at the age of 92 so the final mystery of Moe > Berg's inscrutable life is that nobody knows where he is.\\"Dawidoff, 330 Reviews The Catcher Was a Spy proved to be a popular book, spending seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Critics praised Dawidoff's thorough research and ability to tie together the many facets of Berg's life.Yardley, Jonathan (July 3, 1994) \\"A Whole New Ballgame\\" The Washington Post (Book World – page 3) > \\"Dawidoff ... has done heroic research, much of it in unlit corners, and he > avoids the temptation of rehashing it to excess. For the most part he also > eschews the temptations of amateur psychoanalysis; when he does succumb, it > is mostly to revealing effect. Moe Berg doubtless will forever remain a > mystery, but Dawidoff has brought the mystery to life.\\" > \\"...dealing with Berg's famous elusiveness is where Mr. Dawidoff's biography > shines the brightest. This is not an easy subject to write about, since Berg > grew increasingly evasive as he got older and during the final 25 years of > his life he had no employment or ordered routine.

Originally published on Kirkus Reviews issue: May 1st, 1994. > \\"Dawidoff has taken a mythic character and exposed him as an eccentric crank > whose oversized feet were made almost entirely of clay.

The > reader is left knowing immeasurably more about Moe Berg, and caring > immeasurably less.\\" Film adaptation In April 2016, it was announced that American actor Paul Rudd would portray Berg in the upcoming biographical film The Catcher Was a Spy.

It was once a waterpark before its major redevelopment in 2006. History Big Splash was built in 1977 by Singapore Aquatic Sports Pte Ltd (owned by Goldhill Properties) on a 2.8-hectare site of the reclaimed land in the new East Coast Park. It was a project of the Parks and Recreation Department of the Ministry of National Development, and built at the cost of S$6 million. The waterpark featured an 85-metre long water slide, said at the time to be the longest and highest in the world. There was several other pools, including a wave-pool and a 200 m long flow-pool, as well as facilities such as an open-air theatre, a restaurant and food kiosks, and an arcade. The park opened on 23 July 1977 at 8 a.m. All 5 of the pools in the complex were filled with sea water and had a sand bottom to create the impression of a beach. The largest pool (at the base of the 85-metre slide) was reported to be able to accommodate 1,380 people. Admission fees were $1.50 for adults and $1.00 for children for the first two hours on weekdays, with a subsequent fee of $0.50 for every subsequent two hours; on weekends the admission fees were $2.00 for adults and $1.50 for children for the first two hours and $1 and $0.50 respectively for every subsequent two hours. The air-conditioned restaurant was said to have pioneered the 'tank to table' concept of serving seafood. From 1986 until at least 2002, Big Splash was owned by Potential Investments Pte Ltd. Although Big Splash was initially very popular, over the decades it declined and became less attractive. In 2002, it was closed for a four-month facelift, reopening with new facilities such as a dive school and a bicycle kiosk. In 2006 it closed for major redevelopment. When it reopened as Playground @ Big Splash in March 2008, the water slides were gone and the entire compound had been redeveloped into a dining and lifestyle destination. It was home to a range of dining options, from fast food outlets and casual cafes to upmarket restaurants and bars, as well as an inline skating school, mini-golf course, gym and other amenities. Demolition The last day of its operation was 21 October 2016, its site's lease had expired and was returned to the government for redevelopment. Its structures was later demolished in 2017 while its iconic tower was preserved for upcoming future recreational developments.

Estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) (about 300-350) are also found in the lake. It is not hunted by local people as it is their totem animal connected to their creation story and known as \\"lafaek\\" in the Tetum language. Boats are banned on the lake, based on a traditional belief that the fish in the lake will die when boats enter the water. Villagers were forced to stand in the water to fish, and fatal crocodile attacks were common. Recently fishermen appear to be using rafts to avoid crocodile attacks. The Timor snake-necked turtle (Chelodina mccordi timorensis) is also endemic to the lake and the river. The local dialect name is ‘‘beo’’, the Tetum name is \\"lenok kakorok ular\\" and an alternative English name is Timor long-necked turtle. Chelodina mccordi is considered to be one of the 25 most endangered turtles in the world and is protected under CITES Appendix II. There are 21 fish species in the lake including an endemic species of hardyhead (Craterocephalus laisapi), found in the middle section of the Irasiquero River. The lake area has both migratory and resident water birds. It is part of the Mount Paitchau and Lake Ira Lalaro Important Bird Area (IBA). One of globally threatened bird species reported is the yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphur), which is considered critically endangered. Other species reported are: Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus), wandering whistling duck (Dendrocygna arcuata), common coot (Fulica atra), Swinhoe's snipe (Gallinago megala), Australasian grebe (Tachybaptus novaehollandiae), Timor green pigeon (Treron psittaceus), cinnamon-banded kingfisher (Todiramphus australasia), spot-breasted white-eye (Heleia muelleri), and black-banded flycatcher (Ficedula timorensis). There are 16 species of bats (cave roosters), including Geoffroy's rousette fruit bat (Rousettus amplexicaudatus), Canut's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus canuti), and Sumba round leaf bat (Hipposideros sumbae).

It is an electrical disturbance which can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Excessive QT prolongation can trigger tachycardias such as torsades de pointes (TdP). QT prolongation is an established side effect of anti-arrhythmic medicines, but can also be caused by a wide range of non-cardiac medicines, including antibiotics, antihistamines, opioid analgesics and complementary medicines. On an EKG, the QT interval represents the summation of action potentials in cardiac muscle cells, which can be caused by an increase in inward current through sodium or calcium channels, or a decrease in outward current through potassium channels. By binding to and inhibiting the “rapid” delayed rectifier potassium current protein, certain drugs are able to decrease the outward flow of potassium ions and extend the length of phase 3 myocardial repolarization, resulting in QT prolongation.  Background  A QT interval is a value that is measured on an electrocardiogram. Measurements begin from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave. The value is an indication of the time it takes for a ventricle from the beginning of a contraction to the end of relaxation. The value for a normal QT interval is similar in males and females from birth up to adolescence. During infancy, a normal QTc is defined as 400 +/- 20 milliseconds. Before puberty, the 99th percentile of QTc values is 460 milliseconds. After puberty, this value increases to 470 milliseconds in males and 480 milliseconds in females. Torsades de pointes (TdP) is an arrhythmia. More specifically, it is one form of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that presents with a long QT interval. Diagnosis is made by electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows rapid irregular QRS complexes. The term \\"torsades de pointes\\" is translated from French as \\"twisting of the peaks\\" because the complexes appear to undulate, or twist around, the EKG baseline. TdP can be acquired by inheritance of a congenital long QT syndrome, or more commonly from the ingestion of a pharmacologic drug. During TdP episodes, patients have a heart rate of 200 to 250 beats/minute, which may present as palpitations or syncope. TdP often self-resolves, however, it may lead to ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden cardiac death.  Risk factors  Although it is difficult to predict which individuals will be affected from drug-induced long QT syndrome, there are general risk factors that can be associated with the use of certain medications. Generally, as the dose of a drug increases, the risk of QT prolongation increases as well. In addition, factors such as rapid infusion, concurrent use of more than one drug known to prolong QT interval, diuretic treatment, electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia), advanced age, bradyarrhythmias, and female sex have all been shown to be risk factors for developing drug-induced QT prolongation. TdP has been shown to occur up to three times more often in female patients compared with males, likely as a result of post-pubertal hormonal influence on cardiac ion channels. The QTc interval is longer in females, as well as having a stronger response to IKr-blocking agents. In males, the presence of testosterone upregulates IKr channels and therefore decreases QT interval.. Stated otherwise, estrogens prolong the QT interval, while androgens shorten it and decrease the response to IKr-blocking agents. Structural heart disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy, are also risk factors. Diuretic-induced hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia taken for heart failure can induce proarrthymia. The ischemia that results from myocardial infarctions also induce QT prolongation.  Pathophysiology  ;IKr blockade On EKG, the QT interval represents the summation of action potentials in cardiac muscle cells. QT prolongation therefore results from action potential prolongation, which can be caused by an increase in inward current through sodium or calcium channels, or a decrease in outward current through potassium channels. By binding to and inhibiting the “rapid” delayed rectifier potassium current protein, IKr, which is encoded by the hERG gene, certain drugs are able to decrease the outward flow of potassium ions and extend the length of phase 3 myocardial repolarization, which is reflected as QT prolongation.  Diagnosis  Most patients with drug-induced QT prolongation are asymptomatic and are diagnosed solely by EKG in association with a history of using medications known to cause QT prolongation. A minority of patients are symptomatic and typically present with one or more signs of arrhythmia, such as lightheadedness, syncope, or palpitations. If the arrhythmia persists, patients may experience sudden cardiac arrest. Management Treatment requires identifying and removing any causative medications and correcting any underlying electrolyte abnormalities. While TdP often self-resolves, cardioversion may be indicated if patients become hemodynamically unstable, as evidenced by signs such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been proven to be highly effective for both the treatment and prevention of TdP. Managing patients with TdP is dependent on the patient's stability. Vital signs, level of consciousness, and current symptoms are used to assess stability. Patients who are stable should be managed by removing the underlying cause and correcting electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia. An EKG should be obtained, a cardiac monitor should be attached, IV access should be established, supplemental oxygen should be given, and blood samples should be sent for appropriate studies. Patients should be continually re-evaluated for signs of deterioration until the TdP resolves. In addition to correcting the electrolyte abnormalities, magnesium given intravenously has also been shown to be helpful. Magnesium sulfate given as a 2 g IV bolus mixed with D5W can be given over a period of 15 minutes in patients without cardiac arrest Atrial pacing or administering isoproterenol can normalize the heart rate. Unstable patients exhibit signs of chest pain, hypotension, elevated heart rate, and/or heart failure. Patients who develop cardiac arrest will be pulsesless and unconscious. Defibrillation and resuscitation is indicated in these cases. Patients with cardiac arrest should be given IV magnesium sulfate over a period of two minutes.After diagnosing and treating the cause of LQTS, it is also important to perform a thorough history and EKG screening. Immediate family members should also be screened for inherited and congenital causes of drug-induced QT syndrome.  Incidence  Unfortunately, there is no absolute definition that describes the incidence of drug-induced QT prolongation, as most data is obtained from case reports or small observational studies. Although QT interval prolongation is one of the most common reasons for drug withdrawal from the market, the overall incidence of drug-induced QT prolongation is difficult to estimate. One study in France estimated that between 5-7% of reports of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden cardiac death were in fact due to drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. An observational study from the Netherlands showed that 3.1% of patients who experienced sudden cardiac death were also using a QT- prolonging drug.  Drugs that cause QT prolongation  = Antiarrhythmic agents = Source: * Class IA ** Class IA antiarrthymic drugs work by blocking sodium and potassium channels. Blocking sodium channels tend to shorten the action potential duration, while blocking potassium channels prolongs the action potential. When the drug concentration is at a low to normal concentration, the potassium channel blocking activity takes precedence over the sodium channel blocking activity ***Disopyramide ***Flecainide ***Procainamide ***Propafenone ***Quinidine **** Because of the predominance of the potassium blocking activity, TdP is seen more frequently with therapeutic levels of quinidine. Sodium blocking activity is dominant with subtherapeutic levels, which does not lead to QT prolongation and TdP. * Class III ** Class III antiarrhythmic drugs are potassium channel blockers that cause QT prolongation and are associated with TdP. **Amiodarone *** Amiodarone works in many ways. It blocks sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, as well as alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Because of its multiple actions, amiodarone causes QT prolongation but TdP is rarely observed. **Dofetilide **Ibutilide *** Ibutilide differs from other class III antiarrhythmic agents in that it activates the slow, delayed inward sodium channels rather than inhibiting outward potassium channels. **Sotalol *** Sotalol has beta-blocking activity. Approximately 2 to 7 percent of patients taking at least 320 mg/day experience proarrhythmia, most often in the form of TdP. The risks and effects are dose-dependent. = Psychotropic medications = Psychotropic medications have been shown to lengthen the QT interval and induce TdP, especially when given intravenously or in higher concentrations. *Typical antipsychotics **Chlorpromazine **Haloperidol *** Haloperidol functions by blocking the KCNH2 channel, the same pathway that other drug-inducing LQTS block. Patients taking haloperidol are at a higher risk if they also have electrolyte abnormalities (such as hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia), congenital LQTS, cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, or if they are concurrently taking other medications known to lengthen the QT interval. **Thioridazine *Atypical antipsychotics **Quetiapine *** Overdoses on quetiapine cause QT prolongation in patients with cardiac risks. **Risperidone *** Mild QT prolongation can be caused by risperidone but there are no specific drug warnings associated with this. **Ziprasidone *SSRIs ** An EKG is recommended before patients are prescribed SSRI agents citalopram and escitalopram if the prescribed dose is above 40 mg or 20 mg per day, respectively. **Fluoxetine **Paroxetine **Sertraline *SNRIs **Venlafaxine *Tricyclic antidepressants **Amitriptyline **Desipramine **Doxepin **Imipramine = Antibiotics = Source: *Macrolides **Azithromycin **Clarithromycin **Erythromycin *** When taken independently, erythromycin has been shown to cause both QT prolongation and TdP.

Hamilton (sometimes Jerry Hamilton) was a Wall Street broker noted as \\"the only black millionaire in New York\\" by James McCune Smith about a decade before the American Civil War. Hamilton was a shrewd financial agent, amassing a fortune of $2 million ($250,000,000 in 2018 dollars) by the time of his death in 1875. Although he was the subject of much newspaper coverage and his life provides a unique perspective on race in 19th century America, Hamilton is virtually absent from modern historical literature. Hamilton first came to prominence in 1828 after hiding out in a fishing boat for multiple days in the Port-au-Prince harbor in Haiti and eventually escaping the Haitian authorities. They had discovered he was transporting counterfeit coins to Haiti reportedly for a group of New York merchants; in absentia he was sentenced to be shot. The ship he had chartered, the Ann Eliza Jane, was confiscated by the port officials; Hamilton claimed he had escaped with $5000 of the counterfeit coin. Almost a decade later, after the 1835 Great Fire of New York destroyed most of the buildings on the southeast tip of Manhattan, Hamilton accrued about $5 million in 2013 dollars by \\"taking pitiless advantage of several of the fire victims' misfortunes\\". His business practices were controversial; where most black entrepreneurs sold their goods to other blacks, \\"Hamilton cut a swath through the lily-white New York business world of the mid-1830s, a domain where his depredations soon earned him the nickname of \\"The Prince of Darkness\\". Others, with even less affection, simply called him Hamilton. Soon thereafter, he used about $7 million to buy up a substantial amount of land and property in modern-day Astoria and Poughkeepsie. Hamilton would go on to tuggle with Cornelius Vanderbilt, the famous American industrialist, over control of the Accessory Transit Company. Although he circulated among the financial elite and was himself very wealthy (he amassed a 2018 equivalent fortune of around $250 million), Hamilton was also a victim of the racism against African-Americans so pervasive during his time. During the New York City draft riots in 1863, white men seeking to lynch Hamilton broke into his house, but were turned away with only liquor, cigars, and an old suit by his wife Eliza after she said her husband was not home. Eliza Hamilton was white which made her marriage to Jeremiah taboo for the time. At the time of his death in May 1875, Jeremiah Hamilton was said by obituaries to be the richest black man in the United States. He is buried in his family lot in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. There is no known surviving image of Jeremiah Hamilton. As biographer Shane White has reasoned, Hamilton \\"almost certainly did have photographs taken, and quite likely commissioned a painting, but if any likenesses have survived they are probably catalogued under ‘miscellaneous’ or as ‘subject unknown'.\\"Shane White, Prince of Darkness, The Untold Story of Jeremiah G.

It was the best-known and most popular work of Methodist minister and author Silas Hocking. Published initially as a serial,[Her Benny, author's preface.] and then in book form by Frederick Warne & Co. of London as Her Benny. A Story of Street Life, 1879, with illustrations by Harry Tuck. Hocking, who had published one previous novel (Alec Green, 1878), sold the copyright of this one for just £20, but it was to establish his reputation.John Sutherland, The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction, 1989, p.301 It became hugely successful, was translated into many languages,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Hocking. and sold over a million copies in the author's lifetime.Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Dinah Birch, 7th ed. (2009), entry for Her Benny  Plot  One of Tuck's illustrations, for chapter 3, showing Benny and Nelly Benny Bates, a poor boy from the Liverpool slums, is ten years old when the story begins. He scrapes a living running errands in the streets; his beloved but frail sister Nelly, a year younger, sells matches. Their mother is dead, their father a drink-sodden brute, who dies later on in the story, becomes violent towards Nelly and the two children run away from home. Helped by their friend the night-watchman Joe Wrag, and 'Granny' Betty Barker, manage to retain their independence and learn to lead Christian lives. Nelly, a child of great natural spiritual insight, acts as Benny's moral conscience; when she dies after a street accident, he is in despair. A lucky encounter with Eva Lawrence, the little girl he will come to call his 'angel', leads to a job as office-boy to her father, a rich Liverpool businessman. Benny works hard, hoping to educate and better himself, but loses both job and reputation when Mr. Lawrence wrongly accuses him of stealing a five-pound note. Abandoning Liverpool, he nearly dies of starvation and heat-stroke, but is rescued and nursed back to health by a kindly farming family. He remains with them, working on the farm and studying in night school. Six years later, and by now grown up, he bravely stops a runaway carriage in a nearby lane; only afterwards does he discover that one of its occupants was Eva Lawrence. Benny has saved his 'angel's' life; now she reveals that she and her father have long known that he was innocent of the theft. The grateful Mr. Lawrence offers Benny a new job, this time as his clerk; he returns to Liverpool, to work his way up into partnership with Mr. Lawrence, and marriage with Eva.  Analysis  Her Benny was amongst the most popular examples of the 'waif story', a category of improving fiction for Victorian children whose purpose, although primarily religious (and typically Evangelical), was also social and political.Anna Davin,'Waif Stories in Late Nineteenth-Century England', History Workshop Journal, no. 52 (Autumn 2001) pp.67–98 As Hocking describes in his preface, Her Benny grew out of his Methodist ministry: His local knowledge also emerges in the book's vivid descriptions of Victorian Liverpool, and its careful attempts to reproduce the Scouse dialect. Didactic in intent, yet sympathetic in tone, his 'rags to riches' tale was well calculated to appeal to a contemporary audience. Its form parallels, and was probably influenced by, Hogarth's well-known and widely distributed series of engravings of Industry and Idleness, which had also been aimed at the young. Like them, its principal message is that diligence and honesty will be rewarded; Benny as Industrious Apprentice has his Idle counterpart too, in the character of Perks, a street boy who repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempts to lure Benny into crime, and ends up dying in Dartmoor prison. Hocking's work however is also characteristic of Victorian evangelical fiction in the emphasis placed on Christian piety, and the role of inner spiritual renewal; his Methodist beliefs emerge especially clearly in Joe Wrag's prolonged struggle with the doctrine of Predestination. Hocking's sense of pathos is also characteristically Victorian; in particular the name chosen for Benny's little sister, as well as her character and fate, seem calculated to recall to his readership Little Nell in Dickens's 1840/1841 novel The Old Curiosity Shop, who was also marked for a tragically early grave.  Adaptations  A British silent film version of Her Benny was produced in 1920. In 1993 the novel was also adapted into a successful stage musical by Anne Dalton, with a 25th anniversary revival in 2018. An original cast recording was issued on CD on the 'Dress Circle' label in 1993.

The movement first appeared when Egyptian defence minister, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, called for mass demonstrations on 26 July 2013 to grant the military a \\"mandate\\" to crack down on \\"terrorism\\", which was seen as contradicting the military's pledges to hand over power to civilians after removing Morsi and as an indication for an imminent crackdown against Islamists. The announcement by General el-Sisi was rejected by a number of political groups that had initially supported the military coup, such as the revolutionary April 6 Youth Movement, the moderate Strong Egypt Party, the Salafi Al-Nour Party and several Egyptian human rights groups. In response, The Third Square, a group of activists who mistrust both the military and the Islamists, called for a separate protest in Sphinx Square in Mohandessin, Cairo. One of the activists described the movement as \\"a group of young people whose views are not represented either in Tahrir Square or Rabaa Al-Adawiya\\", referring to the military-organised protests in Tahrir Square and the Islamist protests in Rabia Al-Adawiya square in Nasr City.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater is \\"rainwater and melted snow that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites\\".EPA Stormwater Management http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/stormwater/ Urbanized areas with high concentrations of impervious surfaces like buildings, roads, and driveways produce large volumes of runoff which can lead to flooding, sewer overflows, and poor water quality. Since soil in urban areas can be compacted and have a low infiltration rate, the surface runoff estimated in a runoff footprint is not just from impervious surfaces, but also pervious areas including yards. The total runoff is a measure of the site’s contribution to stormwater issues in an area, especially in urban areas with sewer overflows. Completing a runoff footprint for a site allows a property owner to understand what areas on his or her site are producing the most runoff and what scenarios of stormwater green solutions like rain barrels and rain gardens are most effective in mitigating this runoff and its costs to the community.  Significance  The runoff footprint is the stormwater equivalent to the carbon/energy footprint. When homeowners or business owners complete an energy audit or carbon footprint, they understand how they are consuming energy and learn how this consumption can be reduced through energy efficiency measures. Correspondingly, the runoff footprint allows someone to calculate their baseline annual runoff and assess what the impact of ideal stormwater green solutions would be for their site. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the EPA has monitored and regulated stormwater issues in urban areas. Municipalities across the United States are now required to upgrade sanitary and stormwater systems to meet EPA mandates. The total cost for these upgrades across the United States exceeds $3000 billion.Syracuse.comMunicipalities across the United States need $300 billion in sewer, water upgrades http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html The stormwater runoff from every property in an area can contribute to the overall stormwater issues including overflows and water pollution. Stormwater runoff carries nonpoint source pollution which is a leading cause of water quality issues.EPA - What is Nonpoint Source Pollution? http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/whatis.cfm By completing a runoff footprint, homeowners and business owners can consider how stormwater green solutions can reduce runoff on-site. Stormwater green solutions (also called green infrastructure) use \\"vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments. At the scale of a city or county, green infrastructure refers to the patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air, and cleaner water. At the scale of a neighborhood or site, green infrastructure refers to stormwater management systems that mimic nature by soaking up and storing water\\".What is Green Infrastructure? http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/gi_what.cfm Stormwater green solutions include bioswales (directional rain gardens), cisterns, green roofs, permeable pavement, rain barrels, and rain gardens. According to the EPA, onsite stormwater green solutions or low-impact developments (LIDs) can significantly reduce runoff and costly stormwater/sewer infrastructure upgrades.EPA - Reducing Stormwater Costs http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/green/costs07_index.cfm Stormwater green solutions can also reduce energy consumption. Treating and pumping water is an energy-intensive activity. According to the River Network, the U.S. consumes at least 521 million MWh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption River Network. The Carbon Footprint of Water. http://www.rivernetwork.org/resource- library/carbon-footprint-water Potable water must be treated and then pumped to the consumer. Wastewater is treated before being discharged. In areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewer systems with high inflow and infiltration, stormwater is also treated at the wastewater treatment facilities. By capturing stormwater runoff onsite in rain barrels and cisterns, the consumption of potable water for irrigation and its corresponding energy impact can be reduced. The reduction of runoff from all types of stormwater green solutions reduces the stormwater that may end up at the wastewater treatment facility in areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewers.  Completing a runoff footprint  There are number of methods available to complete a runoff footprint. The simplest methods involve using a runoff coefficient, which according to the State Water Resources Control Board of California is \\"a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received. It is a larger value for areas with low infiltration and high runoff (pavement, steep gradient), and lower for permeable, well vegetated areas (forest, flat land).\\"Runoff Coefficient (C) Fact Sheet http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/cwt/guidance/513.pdf The runoff coefficients for different surface types on a site can be multiplied with the area for each surface along with the annual precipitation to generate a rough runoff footprint. If the runoff coefficient and areas of proposed stormwater green solutions like rain gardens and bioswales for the site are known, the reduction in overall runoff from these improvements can be estimated. More accurate runoff footprint tools exist. By using computer modeling and detailed weather data, complex runoff footprints can be made easy. The amounts of pollution in the stormwater runoff can be estimated, and the effects of combinations of stormwater green solutions can be assessed. The James River Association of central Virginia provides an online tool where property owners in the James River watershed can generate a site-specific runoff pollution report.JRA - Do you know What’s in Your Runoff? http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/ MyRunoff.org provides an online runoff footprint calculator for property owners across the United States to estimate their baseline runoff and the reduction from different scenarios of rain barrels and rain gardens.MyRunoff.org's Runoff Footprint Calculator. http://myrunoff.org/ The EPA launched the National Stormwater Calculator in July, 2013, which is a desktop application for Windows allowing users to model the annual impact of a range of stormwater green solutions.National Stormwater Calculator http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/swc/  References  External links * MyRunoff.org's Runoff Footprint Calculator * EPA's National Stormwater Calculator * James River Association Runoff Calculator Category:Water supply Category:Water pollution Category:Water and the environment Category:Environmental engineering Category:Hydrology and urban planning Category:Landscape Category:Sustainable urban planning ","title":"Runoff footprint"},{"id":"40084908","text":"thumb Brian Kesinger is an American illustrator, author and animator who has worked at Walt Disney Studios for 20+ years. His works are steeped in Victorian steampunk art. Born into a family of musicians, he was the only one not able to play an instrument. His fondness for drawing was so apparent that his parents supported his artistic training throughout his school days. He started drawing steampunk art long before the term was coined. In 2000 he did the layout and background design for Walt Disney's film Atlantis: The Lost Empire. It was during this period that he developed a fondness for drawing submarines, gears and similar gadgets. Following this he became involved with the film Treasure Planet and grew to like tall ships and sci-fi. Other films he has worked on include Winnie the Pooh, Tarzan, Tangled, Chicken Little, Home on the Range, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons. Brian Kesinger was raised on a steady diet of Walt Disney creations by parents who felt it important for him to be exposed to art. He was accepted at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank, California, during his senior year at high school, becoming in 1996 at age 18 the youngest animator in the history of the company. He started as a layout artist on the film Tarzan and in his career with Disney Animation has filled many positions ranging from visual development to story artist. In 2011 he received the Annie Award for his story work on Disney's Prep and Landing, with his most recent film at Disney being the Academy Award-nominated Wreck-It Ralph. In Wreck-It Ralph Kesinger's voice is used for the Cyborg, a character based on Kano from Midway Games's Mortal Kombat franchise. Away from his office he has created fantasy steampunk worlds peopled with memorable characters under the banner of \\"Tea Girls\\", illustrations using tea-stain washes and finished in ink and watercolours, including a portrait of steampunk chanteuse Veronique Chevalier. Two of his most popular characters are the unlikely duo of Victoria Prismall, an independent young lady, and Otto (Italian for 'eight'), her live-in octopus who is a friend, butler and pet. They have appeared in books, prints, T-shirts, and more. Kesinger has published his first illustrated book on the couple, Walking Your Octopus: A Guide to the Domesticated Cephalopod. He describes it as \\"a satirical look at how we all can get a little carried away with how we raise our pets. It’s certainly inspired by my own dog Scout but also inspired by the ups and downs of raising two young children with my wife. My hope is that the book speaks to not only steampunk fans but pet owners and parents as well.\\" Thirty full-page illustrations portray the couple at home and about, bathing, biking, dating, cooking, playing croquet, pumpkin carving, and other activities necessary for the spiritual well-being of an intelligent and worldly octopus. Kesinger finds it entertaining to draw the octopus and is constantly challenged by having to find things for each tentacle to do. In that sense an octopus is a natural at multi-tasking and has enthralled a great many people. Cephalopods generally have become a theme animal for steampunk, so that Kesinger found the choice of octopus as Victoria's soulmate an easy one to make. The popularity of Otto and Victoria, though, came as a surprise, as did the fan art, tattoos and the appearance of girls cosplaying Victoria at conventions all over the country. He plans to produce a full-length film featuring Otto and Victoria’s adventures, purely to satisfy his own wish for a well-rendered steampunk animated film. Kesinger created a mashup of Kylo Ren and Darth Vader and the comic strip 'Calvin and Hobbes.' It also stars Kylo's parents, Princess Leia and Han Solo.

There are three paired major salivary glands in humans – (the parotid glands, the submandibular glands, and the sublingual glands), and about 800-1000 minor salivary glands in the mucosa of the mouth. The parotid gland is located in front of the ear, and it secretes its mostly serous saliva via the parotid duct (Stenson duct) into the mouth, usually opening roughly opposite the maxillary second molar. The submandibular gland is located medial to the angle of the mandible, and it drains its mixture of serous and mucous saliva via the submandibular duct (Wharton duct) into the mouth, usually opening in a punctum located in the floor of mouth. The sublingual gland is located below the tongue, in the floor of the mouth. It drains its mostly mucous saliva into the mouth via about 8-20 ducts which open along the plica sublingualis (a fold of tissue under the tongue). The function of the salivary glands is to secrete saliva, which has a lubricating function, which protects the oral mucosa of the mouth during eating and speaking. Saliva also contains digestive enzymes (e.g. salivary amylase) and has antimicrobial action and acts as a buffer. Salivary gland dysfunction occurs when salivary rates are reduced and this can result in xerostomia (dry mouth). Various examples of disorders affecting the salivary glands are listed below. Some are more common than others, and they are considered according to a surgical sieve, but this list is not exhaustive. Sialadenitis is inflammation of a salivary gland, usually caused by infections, although there are other less common causes of inflammation such as irradiation, allergic reactions or trauma. Congenital Stafne defect Congenital disorders of the salivary glands are rare, but may include: * Aplasia * Atresia * Ectopic salivary gland tissue * Stafne defect - an uncommon condition which some consider to be an anatomic variant rather than a true disease. It is thought to be created by an ectopic portion of salivary gland tissue which causes the bone of the mandible to remodel around the tissue, creating an apparent cyst like radiolucent area on radiographs. Classically, this lesion is discovered as a chance finding, since it causes no symptoms. It appears below the inferior alveolar nerve canal in the posterior region of the mandible. Acquired =Dysfunction= Salivary gland dysfunction affects the flow, amount, or quality of saliva produced. A reduced salivation is termed hyposalivation. Hyposalivation often results in a dry mouth condition called xerostomia, and this can cause tooth decay due to the loss of the protective properties of saliva. In addition, The results of a study have suggested that hyposalivation could lead to acute respiratory infection. There are two potential reasons for increasing the incidence rate of this infection. First, reduced saliva secretion may impair the oral and airway mucosal surface as a physical barrier, which consequently enhances the adhesion and colonization of viruses. Second, this reduction may also impair the secretion of antimicrobial proteins and peptides. Considering presence of many proteins and peptides with established antiviral properties in saliva, some of which can potentially inhibit virus replication especially coronavirus, it gives the impression that the protective effect of these salivary proteins against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be the same. Therefore, hyposalivation could be a potential risk factor for acute respiratory infection. It may expose patients at high risk of getting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, further investigations are crucial to prove this hypothesis. Hypersalivation is the overproduction of saliva and has many causes. =Vascular= * Necrotizing sialometaplasia—a lesion that usually arises from a minor salivary gland on the palate. It is thought to be due to vascular infarction of the salivary gland lobules. It is often mistaken for oral cancer, but the lesion is not neoplastic. =Infective= Infections involving the salivary glands can be viral or bacterial (or rarely fungal). * Mumps is the most common viral sialadenitis. It usually occurs in children, and there is preauricular pain (pain felt in front of the ear), swelling of the parotid, fever, chills, and headaches. * Bacterial sialadentitis is usually caused by ascending organisms from the oral cavity. Risk factors include reduced salivary flow rate. * Human immunodeficiency virus-associated salivary gland disease (HIV-SGD). =Traumatic= Mucocele * Mucocele — these are common and are caused by rupture of a salivary gland duct and mucin spillage into the surrounding tissues. Usually they are caused by trauma. Classically, a mucocele is blusish and fluctuant, and most commonly occurs on the lower lip. * Ranula — the name used when a mucocele occurs in the floor of the mouth (underneath the tongue). Ranulas may grow to a larger size than mucoceles at other sites, and they are usually associated with the sublingual gland, although less commonly they may also arise from the submandibular gland or a minor salivary gland. Uncommonly, a ranula may descend into the neck rather than the mouth (plunging ranula). If small, the ranula may be left alone, but if larger and causing symptoms, excision of the sublingual gland may be indicated. * Nicotinic stomatitis — the hard palate is whitened by hyperkeratosis caused by the heat from tobacco use or hot liquid consumption. This irritation also causes inflammation of the duct openings of the minor salivary glands of the palate, and they become dilated. This manifests as red patches or spots on a white background.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 137 =Autoimmune= * Sjögren's syndrome * Graft-versus-host disease =Inflammatory= * Post-irradiation sialadenitis * Sarcoidosis—there may be parotitis alone or uveoparotitis (inflammation of both the parotid and the uvea of the eyes), which occurs in Heerfordt's syndrome. * Cheilitis glandularis—This is inflammation of the minor salivary glands, usually in the lower lip, eversion and swelling of the lip. * Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a salivary gland manifestation of IgG4-related disease. =Neurological= * Frey's syndrome =Neoplastic= * Salivary gland neoplasm =Diverticulum= A salivary diverticulum (plural diverticuli) is a small pouch or out-pocketing of the duct system of a major salivary gland. Such diverticuli typically cause pooling of saliva and recurrent sialadenitis, especially parotitis. A diverticulum may also cause a sialolith to form. The condition can be diagnosed by sialography. Affected individuals may \\"milk\\" the salivary gland to encourage flow of saliva through the duct. =Unknown= * Sialolithiasis - although several possibly coexisting factors have been suggested to be involved in the formation of salivary stones, including altered acidity of saliva, reduced salivary flow rate, abnormal calcium metabolism and abnormalities in the sphincter mechanism of the duct opening, the exact cause in many cases is unknown. * Sialadenosis (sialosis) is an uncommon, non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic, recurrent swelling of the salivary glands. The cause is hypothesized to be abnormalities of neurosecretory control. It may be associated with alcoholism.

In his political career Ruthnaswamy was a Councillor for the Corporation of Madras, then a member of the Madras Legislative Council, being appointed President of the Council in September 1925 after the death of L. D. Swamikannu Pillai. He held office until the following election, in November 1926. He later served on the Madras Service Commission,as Member and later chairman, was nominated as a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, and after independence nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha (1968–74). He was initially associated with the Justice Party, and after it was dissolved remained independent until he joined the newly formed Swatantra Party.H.E.

While at school and college, he was declared on several occasions as the best orator, and was also prominent in cultural activities. In 1907, he secured admission in Jesus College, Oxford, and left for England, later shifting to the University of Cambridge to complete his History Tripos in 1910. At the same time he enrolled himself in Gray's Inn (1907–1910) and returned to India as a barrister (Bar at Law) in 1911. He was determined not to practice Law in spite of compulsion from his father. Educationist, administrator and politician Ruthnaswamy became a Councillor, Corporation of Madras in 1921 a position he held till 1923.

Once the formation of the Swatantra Party was announced in Madras on 6 June 1959 by C.Rajagopalachari and Minoo Masani, one of the earliest members were Ruthnaswamy, NG Ranga, Field Marshal Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala. Prof. N.G.Ranga one of the founders of the Swatantra Party mentioned, \\"Decades later, when we formed the Swatantra Party with the blessings of Sri Rajagopalachari... with myself as the President, Ruthnaswami was good enough to join it and we were all happy to elect him as its Vice-President..... We elected Ruthnaswami to the Rajya Sabha for 2 terms.. He was however eloquent and persuasive advocate. He was listened to with great respect. Ruthnaswami wanted priority to be given to coordination of opposition because he was particular about bi-partisan Parliamentarianism. All our efforts to help Swatantra, Janata, B.K.D and Praja parties to combine or to coordinate failed...

In 1937, Pope Pius XI conferred the Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KCSG) on him. This honour is conferred on Catholics and non-Catholics alike. In 1968, the Government of India conferred Ruthnaswamy with the Padma Bhushan for Literature and Education One of the rare occasions when the Leader of the Opposition (Rajya Sabha) was conferred such an award. Legacy In Prof.N.G.Ranga Papers the veteran Parliamentarian who held the Guinness World Record for being the longest serving Parliamentarian mentions \\"Prof.M.Ruthnaswami lived as a exemplary scholar, educationalist, administrator and champion of backward classes and minorities.

It was organized by the Workers' Party of Belgium (WPB). In 1992, Ludo Martens, leader of the WPB initiated the conference, which gathered various tendencies of Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations. He is noted for having proposed the unification of the four main tendencies of the Marxist-Leninist movement. These are the pro-Soviet groups, the pro-Chinese, the pro-Albanian, and pro-Cuban. Around 200 organizations of Africa, Latin America, North America, Asia and Europe have taken part in it. For four years, from 1992 to 1995, the ICS worked on identifying \\"the true causes of the capitalist restoration in Soviet Union\\" and in Eastern Europe and to draw lessons from it for the future.Presentation on the International Communist Seminar, 2006 (accessed on Sept. 28, 2010) The last seminar took place in June 2014.

Biography Mónica Ayos Crámer was born on June 19, 1974 in Buenos Aires. She is the daughter of the dancers Víctor Ayos and Mónica Crámer. As her parents frequently left the country on dance tours, she lived with her grandmother in Mar del Plata, and attended the local elementary school. She returned to Buenos Aires, and attended high school in San Telmo. She had small assignments as an actress at the age of 12. She was emancipated at the age of 16, and visited Chile. She had a son with a Chilean that she broke up with a few months later, and raised her son as a single mother. After several castings, she got minor roles in the TV comedies La Familia Benvenuto, Mi cuñado and Naranja y Media. Working in Canal 9 at midnight, she became a notable dancer and singer, and worked with Nito Artaza, Miguel Ángel Cherutti, Tristán and Jorge Corona.

The Garfield Barwick Commonwealth Law Courts Building (named in honor of Sir Garfield Barwick), houses courts of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. Parramatta is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.Parramatta (New South Wales, Australia) - Encyclopædia Britannica It is located in Greater Western Sydney west of the Sydney central business district on the banks of the Parramatta River. Parramatta, founded in the same year as Sydney by the British in 1788, is the oldest inland European settlement in Australia and is the economic capital of Greater Western Sydney and the sixth largest central business district in Australia. The Parramatta Justice Precinct provides, in addition to judicial and administrative functions, community service health- and welfare-related needs. History =Parramatta Courthouse= The first Parramatta courthouse was opened by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1791 and was closed and demolished in 1826 due to the poor condition of the building. Thereafter, the Parramatta district used a rented building for judicial activities. The second Parramatta courthouse, located at the corner of Church Street and George Street, was designed by Mortimer Lewis, built in 1837 by Houlson and Payten, and extended in 1853. It was in use between 1837 and 1891. Following its disestablishment, some of the original courthouse's columns were used to form the Boer War Memorial in Parramatta Park;Parramatta Heritage Ride the remainder of the courthouse is now the Courthouse Wall. The third Parramatta courthouse, located at the corner of George Street and Marsden Street, was opened in 1896. In the 1940s, a new courthouse and offices were added; but, it was still inadequate and a new courthouse was required. Notably, this courthouse bore the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The fourth Parramatta courthouse, located across the road from the fifth and current Parramatta courthouse, was opened on 8 November 1974, by Governor Sir Roden Cutler. The courthouse remained in operation from 1974 till 2008. The Parramatta Courthouse, the fifth and current courthouse opened in Parramatta, is a courthouse complex located within the Parramatta Justice Precinct. The complex includes a Children's Court and a trial court with nine courtrooms for criminal trials. =Parramatta Justice Precinct= The area on which the current Parramatta Justice Precinct is located was the site for health services since 1790, including the Colonial Hospital, founded in 1818. In August 2005, the Parramatta Justice Precinct project was conceived and the contract, worth AUD 300 million, for the design and construction project was won by Brookfeld Multiplex. The Precinct's offices are highly energy efficient and are rated 5-star Green Star developments and 5-star Australian Building Greenhouse Rating.Parramatta Justice Precinct - Australian National Construction Review In Media The precinct was featured predominantly in the ABC television drama series Crownies, broadcast during 2011, and the subsequent spin-off series, Janet King, broadcast between 2014 and 2016.

First appointed viceroy of Martaban, one of the three provinces of the Mon-speaking kingdom, by King Binnya Ran II, Saw Binnya ruled the province like a sovereign during the reign of King Takayutpi, his brother-in-law. Under his leadership, the port of Martaban became an international entrepôt, and grew tremendously wealthy. He was able to build up a formidable military of his own, replete with Portuguese mercenaries and arms. But his refusal to contribute to Takayutpi's war effort against Toungoo Dynasty greatly facilitated Toungoo's conquest of Pegu in 1538–1539, and ultimately resulted in the downfall of his own fiefdom in 1541. He was subsequently executed. Ruler of Martaban Saw Binnya was appointed viceroy of the province of Martaban, one of the three provinces of Hanthawaddy, by King Binnya Ran II, c. 1510s. (He was already viceroy in 1519 when he signed a commercial treaty with the Portuguese,Phayre 1967: 96 who spelled his name as \\"Chau Bainha\\".Harvey 1925: 155 He was probably of high Hanthawaddy royalty, since only the most senior princes were appointed viceroy.) When Takayutpi became king in 1526, by the tradition of having blood ties with the sovereign, Saw Binnya took Takayutpi's eldest younger sister Princess Tala Kamu as his chief queen.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 196 Despite the initial gesture, he did not respect the 15-year-old king, who proved to be utterly disinterested in governing and spent his time in \\"frivolous amusements with bad companions\\".Phayre 1967: 94 In the following years, Saw Binnya scarcely acknowledged his overlord at Pegu, and ruled \\"the 32 districts of Martaban\\" (roughly, present-day Mon State and southern Kayin State) like a sovereign. His deputy Binnya U, governor of Moulmein (Mawlamyaing), was also married to a sister of Takayutpi but nonetheless was more loyal to him than the high king.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179 Saw Binnya conducted his own trade and foreign relations. Under his leadership, Martaban became an entrepôt, and according to the accounts of Portuguese explorers, grew tremendously wealthy. Using the trade wealth, he was able to assemble a formidable military which by 1540 employed expensive Portuguese mercenaries, their firearms and warships.Phayre 1967: 96–97 He essentially declared independence from Pegu in 1534 by refusing to contribute to Takayutpi's war effort against Toungoo Dynasty as vassals were obligated to do. Takayutpi, not an able king, could not organize any retaliatory action against Toungoo or Martaban. In the following years, Saw Binnya was content to look on as Toungoo forces raided deeper and deeper into Lower Burma. He did not anticipate any immediate danger to his own realm as Toungoo without any foreign weapons repeatedly failed to take the Hanthawaddy capital Pegu (Bago), which was defended by foreign mercenaries. When Toungoo finally took Pegu in late 1538, Takayutpi so distrusted Saw Binnya that he chose to retreat to Prome Kingdom, another state, rather than to Martaban.Htin Aung 1967: 109–110 War with Toungoo Takayutpi died in early 1539 in exile, and Saw Binnya at once proclaimed himself king. He did not seem concerned by the arrival of the kingdom of Toungoo at his doorstep. In 1540, he received an ultimatum from King Tabinshwehti of Toungoo to submit in exchange for amnesty but he was unimpressed. He reckoned that Toungoo had gained Pegu only through a ruse against an incompetent ruler like Takayutpi, and that when Pegu's defenses were led by capable leaders, Toungoo could not take Pegu for four years. He believed that his Portuguese-backed military under his leadership could withstand any attack Toungoo could muster. He had already heavily fortified the city with high walls that could withstand even Portuguese cannon; deployed seven Portuguese warships to guard the harbor; and enlisted foreign mercenaries led by Paulo de Seixas to lead the defenses. He rejected the ultimatum.Harvey 1925: 155 Saw Binnya's confidence was not completely unfounded. In fact, the Toungoo command after the conquest of Pegu deliberated an attack on Martaban that would have begun in November 1539 but decided against it, citing the city's strong defenses.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 190 Instead, Toungoo prepared for war against Martaban throughout 1539 and 1540. By November 1540, Tabinshwehti had assembled a 13,000-strong force including 700 Portuguese troops who brought their muskets and cannon. In the meantime, Saw Binnya's defensive plans were frustrated by the governor of Moulmein's decision to stay out of the fight. (Binnya U also received Tabinshwehti's ultimatum. He did not submit to the Toungoo king but responded that he would stay out of the fight.) Abandoned by his vassals, Saw Binnya was now in a similar situation as the predicament he himself put Takayutpi in just a few years earlier.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179–180 In November 1540, Toungoo forces invaded, and quickly surrounded the city. Martaban's well-prepared defenses kept the besiegers at bay for months. However, mass starvation eventually set inside the city. Saw Binnya finally offered to surrender provided that he be allowed to remain viceroy in exchange for an annual tribute of 30,000 viss (48,987.9 kg) of silver bullion and other valuable presents. Tabinshwehti rejected the offer, demanding an unconditional surrender instead. Saw Binnya then asked for safe-conduct out of the city for himself and his entire family, together with his treasures. It too was rejected by the Burmese king. In desperation, Saw Binnya appealed to the Portuguese viceroy at Goa for assistance, offering to become a vassal of Goa, in addition to an outright gift of half the amount of his treasury.Htin Aung 1967: 110 The Portuguese were interested. A Portuguese captain listed the treasure as consisting of two shiploads of gold and silver, and 26 chests of precious stones. In addition, gold to be looted from the city's pagodas would fill 4 ships. But the Portuguese also feared the vengeance of Tabinshwehti, the new power in Lower Burma, and \\"wavered between greed and prudence\\". At the same time, Saw Binnya offered a large bribe to João Caeiro, the leader of Portuguese mercenaries fighting for Toungoo, to help him and his family escape. Caeiro seriously considered the overly generous offer but ultimately declined the offer as his deputies found out the proposal and threatened to report the matter to Tabinshwehti.Harvey 1925: 156–157 Death In May 1541, after a seven-month siege, Toungoo naval forces led by Adm. Smim Payu broke through the seven Portuguese ships at the harbor, and the city's defenses were breached. Inside the city, Saw Binnya, described as athletic and brave, led his forces atop a war elephant against the invaders. He is said to have fought off several one- on-one combats on elephant-back. He was finally defeated in combat by Commander Nanda Kyawthu, and was arrested. The viceroy remained chivalrous to the end. He congratulated Nanda Kyawthu for his victory, and gave the Toungoo commander presents from his treasury. Tabinshwehti congratulated Saw Binnya for his bravery and chivalrySein Lwin Lay 2006: 183–184 but did not forgive him. The Toungoo king ordered the execution of the viceroy, his family and all the \\"gallant defenders\\" of the city. The mass execution had the desired effect: The remaining vassals of Martaban down to the Siamese border duly submitted to Toungoo.

The battalion had been serving in 125th Infantry Brigade of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, which were redesignated 10th Armoured Brigade and 42nd Armoured Division respectively. All three regiments in the brigade were drawn from the Lancashire Fusiliers and underwent simultaneous conversion to armour (the other two became 108 RAC and 143 RAC).Joslen, pp. 164, 310. In common with other infantry units transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, personnel continued to wear their Lancashire Fusiliers buttons and the cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, but the rank of 'Fusilier' for private soldiers was replaced by 'Trooper', despite some resistance from the regiment.

He studied the mandolin at an early age and became one of the most renowned performers on this instrument. At a later date he adopted the violin also, for in 1796 he was one of the first violins in the orchestra of the Court Opera, Vienna.Philip J. Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914. pp. 26, 169–170 Born in Zlonice, near Kladno, now part of the Czech Republic, Krumpholz was the son of a bandmaster in a French regiment who lived in Paris during childhood, learning music from his father. His brother, Johann Baptist Krumpholz, was also a musician, a celebrated harpist and composer. According to music historian Philip J. Bone, there was a strong friendship between Wenzel Krumpholz and Ludwig van Beethoven. Bone talked about the relationship between Krumpholz and Beethoven in his book The Guitar and Mandolin. He said that Krumpholz's name was \\"immortalized by his intimacy with Beethoven, who was exceedingly fond of him, and who used to jokingly call him mein Narr (my fool).\\" He talked about what men in the music business had to say about the Beethoven-Krumpholz friendship: according to Ferdinand Ries, Krumpholz gave Beethoven instruction on the violin when in Vienna and it is most probable that he gave instruction on the mandolin. Carl Czerny said in his autobiography that it was Krumpholz who had introduced him to Beethoven, and that Krumpholz was one of the first to recognize Beethoven's genius and inspired others with his own enthusiasm.[Christopher John Murray, Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850, p. 246] Bone said that Krumpholz frequently played the mandolin to Beethoven and indicated that it influenced Beethoven to write music for the instrument. He talked about research done by Dominco Artaria, who had bought a Skizzenbook, containing sketches of some of Beethoven's music. Artaria stated in his Aittographische Skizze that Beethoven intended to write a sonata for mandolin and pianoforte for Krumpholz. This composition is the one sketched in Beethoven's note book (preserved as (No. 29,801) in the manuscript department of the British Museum) and it was first made public by Breitkopf and Hartel, Leipzig.Ludwig van Beethoven, Skizzenbuch \\"Engelmann\\" zu den Diabelli- Variationen op. 120 und der 9.

Early life  Dzhunkovskaya was born in Yurkovka, Kiev Oblast to a Ukrainian peasant family. She graduated as a nurse from Grozny medical school in 1938. Then, she changed her mind and went to Moscow to study aeronautical engineering in Moscow Aviation Institute.  Wartime career  When the war started, she was recruited by Marina Raskova to the 122nd Special Aviation Group and had her navigator's training at Engels Military Flying School. Then, she was assigned to the 587th Bombardment Aviation Regiment, which was later renamed the 125th Guards Dive Bomber Regiment in which she flew as navigator on a Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber. On 6 June 1943, Dzhunkovskaya took part in a fierce aerial combat. Her squadron (9 aircraft), flying in V-formation, was attacked by 10 German fighters. The squadron is credited with 5 kills in that combat, one of which was the second shared kill of Dzhunkovskaya, while four Pe-2 aircraft were seriously damaged and made emergency landings on available Soviet airfields near the front. One of these aircraft was the Dzhunkovskaya's, which had both engines aflame. Her pilot Klavdia Fomicheva commanded her and the gunner to bail out, but they disobeyed because German fighters persisted in attacking the aircraft. Both the navigator and the gunner kept fighting the Germans. When the navigator run out of ammunition, she used aerial grenades (some sources claim that she used signal flares). After the enemy fighters broke off, Dzhunkovskaya helped Fomicheva to find a suitable landing place, an airfield, and to land the burning aircraft. During the spring of 1944, Dzhunkovskaya and Fomicheva flew together for a long time. On 23 June 1944, in their second sortie of the day, their aircraft was hit by enemy flack while approaching the target; the left engine was set aflame and the gunner killed. Fomicheva herself was severely wounded in the leg, but continued the mission and dropped the bombs on the target. Then she turned the burning aircraft and flew on until they reached friendly territory. Fomicheva and Dzhunkovskaya bailed out at an altitude of about ; both suffered serious burns. On 23 December 1944, Dzhunkovskaya was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having completed 62 missions, taken part in five aerial engagements and been credited with two shared kills.  Later life  Shortly after the end of the war in June 1945 Dzhunkovskaya was transferred to the 107th Separate Airborne Communication Squadron, which was based in Mongolia as part of the 6th Bomber Aviation Corps. With that unit she participated Soviet-Japanese War from August to September, seeing combat in the Khingan-Mukden operation in Manchuria. While a navigator on the Pacific front she was officially awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 18 August 1945. After receiving the title she remained in the military for several more years, and continued to serve with the 107th squadron in the Far East until being transferred in 1946 to the 326th Long- range Bomber Aviation Division.

Engley (1851–1910) was an American attorney and political activist. Engley is best remembered as the 9th Attorney General of the state of Colorado, holding that position as the elected candidate of the People's Party from 1893-94. Engley was also a prominent figure in the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903-04 as an advocate for the striking miners affiliated with the Western Federation of Miners. Biography =Early years= Eugene D. Engley was born April 5, 1851 in Attleborough, Massachusetts, the son of James Henry Engley and his wife, the former Mary Kaley.\\"Descendants of Jonathan Ingley,\\" www.richgenealogy.com/ After attending public school in Massachusetts, Engley came west to Colorado in 1873, setting up residence in the southwestern corner of the state.Frank Hall, \\"Eugene Engley,\\" History of the State of Colorado...In Four Volumes: Volume 4.

Engley married Hilda Jayne Gaines in Colorado Springs on April 4, 1881.\\"Hilda Jayne Gaines,\\" rootsweb.ancestry.com/ His wife would die of cancer of the uterus in 1898, at the age of 43. =Career= Engley began his life in Colorado as a newspaper publisher, launching the first newspaper in La Plata County, The Southwest. Engley later moved to Durango, Colorado, where he published a newspaper called The Daily Republican. In 1882 Engley was chosen as city attorney of Durango. Engley moved to the town of Antonito, Colorado, where he served intermittently as county attorney of Conejos County from 1884 to 1891. Engley was made the city attorney of Antonito in 1891. In 1892 Engley became active in the People's Party (so-called \\"Populists\\").Mila Tupper Maynard, \\"An Historic Socialist,\\" Chicago Daily Socialist, vol. 4, no. 154 (April 25, 1910), pg. 6. In 1893 Engley was elected Colorado Attorney General on the People's Party ticket, defeating both Republican and Democratic opponents. He would remain in that position until the expiration of his term of office in 1894. As was the case with many Populists following the fusion of the People's Party with the Democratic Party during the Presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan in 1896, Engley moved into the emerging socialist movement in subsequent years. Engley was instrumental in writing the first two platforms of the Socialist Party of Colorado following the establishment of the Socialist Party of America in 1901. During the first decade of the 20th Century Engley worked as a lawyer in the Cripple Creek, Colorado, a mining district beset by labor strife. Engley supported the cause of the Western Federation of Miners during the Cripple Creek Strike of 1903-04, organizing meetings in streets and halls in support of the miners, at which he denounced the actions of the mine-owners' association and the Colorado Citizens' Alliance. This made Engley persona non grata with the political establishment of Teller County, Colorado, which governed during the strike under the blanket of martial law. During the evening of August 20, 1904 Engley and several other prominent community leaders in sympathy with the miners were detained by armed men on horseback and physically deported from Cripple Creek.\\"Mob in Control at Cripple Creek,\\" The Standard Union [Brooklyn, vol. 41, no. 51 (Aug. 21, 1904), pg. 1.

Engley refused to submit, however, and returned several days later to Cripple Creek armed with a rifle, with which he marched along the town's streets, making his return known. Thereafter Engley remained unmolested, albeit fully armed at all times, until the end of the bitter and violent labor dispute and the martial law which accompanied it. In the years after the strike Engley's law practice was subjected to a boycott by many citizens of the community, resulting in its loss of economic viability.\\"Gone But Not Forgotten,\\" The Miners Magazine [Denver], vol. 11, whole no. 357 (April 28, 1910), pg. 6. =Death and legacy= A few years before his death Engley moved from Cripple Creek to Alamosa, Colorado, where he lived in retirement from the legal profession, reading and writing on social and economic issues of the day.

Garson, who was hired in April 2018, spent his previous five seasons as head coach at the College of Idaho where he led the Yotes to a 129-42 record, three Cascade Collegiate Conference regular season championships, three league tournament titles and four NAIA national tournament appearances, including a run to the 2015 national quarterfinals and 2018 semifinals. Prior to his time at the College of Idaho, Garson was on Ben Howland’s staff at UCLA for nine seasons, worked under Rick Majerus at Utah for 5 years and spent 1 season at Pepperdine University under Lorenzo Romar. During his 21 seasons in college basketball at 5 different schools, Coach Garson has been a part of 20 winning seasons, 17 postseason berths and 10 conference championships. Garson led the Yotes to both the CCC regular-season and tournament titles in 2014, 2015 and 2018. He became the first coach at the school to win back-to-back league crowns since the 1950s. His 2014-15 team posted a 30-6 record, which was then the second-most single-season victories in the school’s 105-year men’s basketball program history. The 2017-18 squad matched that total when they finished 30-7. Garson was the recipient of the 2015 Red Auerbach National Coach of the Year Award, and was named the 2014 and 2018 CCC Coach of the Year. He coached six NAIA All-Americans, two CCC Players of the Year and three CCC Defensive Players of the Year. In all, 17 players under Garson earned All- CCC honors and 13 secured Academic All-CCC selections. His College of Idaho teams enjoyed home cooking, posting a 76-10 mark at J.A. Albertson Activities Center. During his tenure, home attendance nearly doubled, with the Yotes leading the NAIA in home attendance during the 2014-15 campaign and finishing second during 2015-16 and 2016-17.

Garson was responsible for the development of the UCLA perimeter players – including current NBA players, Russell Westbrook, Arron Afflalo, Darren Collison, Jrue Holiday, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Shabazz Muhammad, Kyle Anderson, and Norman Powell. Garson also was responsible for the recruitment of Zach LaVine, the 13th overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft and 2-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion. Garson was instrumental in the recruiting efforts for the Bruins, who claimed ESPN’s No. 1 class in both 2008 and 2012. A total of 16 players recruited or coached by Garson have been selected in the NBA Draft. Garson spent five seasons at the University of Utah under hall-of-fame coach and mentor, Rick Majerus.

The work was exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne (no. 610); Jack of Diamonds, Moscow, 1912; the Salon de la Société Normande de Peinture Moderne, Rouen, summer 1912; the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La Boétie, 1912 (no. 37), Le Cubisme, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, 1953 (no. 64 bis), and several major exhibitions during subsequent years. In 1913 the painting was reproduced in Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations esthétiques by Guillaume Apollinaire. Executed in a highly dynamic Cubist style, with multiple faceted views, the work nevertheless retains recognizable elements relative to its subject matter. Description La Chasse is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 123.2 by 99 cm (48.5 x 39 inches) signed \\"Albert Gleizes\\", lower right. Painted in 1911.Christie's, Albert Gleizes, 1911, La Chasse, oil on canvas, 123.2 x 99 cm, Lot description In this outdoor hunting scene the horizon line is almost on top of the canvas. Seven people are present, along with numerous animals.P. Alibert, Albert Gleizes, naissance et avenir du cubisme, Saint-Etienne, 1982, p. 71 A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) can be seen in the foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition. Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing), oil on canvas, 269 x 353 cm, National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, Japan With its epic subject matter—far removed from neutral themes of the fruit dish, violin, and seated nudes exhibited by Picasso and Braque in the private boutique of Kahnweiler—The Hunt was destined form its very inception to be exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, at the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées; a huge public venue where several thousand viewers would see the works exhibited. Gleizes rarely painted still lifes, his epic interests usually finding sympathetic echos in more inclusive themes, such as La Chasse (The Hunt) and the monumental Harvest Threshing (Le Dépiquage des Moissons) of 1912. He wished to create a heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory, an art dealing on the one hand with relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, and ultimately, the city itself (based on observations of the real world). And on the other, he wished to project tradition and accumulated cultural thought (based on memory).Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, 1964 Gleizes continually stressed subjects of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. He regarded the painting as a manifold where subjective consciousness and the objective nature of the physical world could not only coincide but also be resolved. > Here Gleizes not only created a synthetic landscape, in which elements are > placed in unreal but symbolic relationships to each other, but also created > a synthesis of social experience, showing two distinct types of human use of > the land. Le Fauconnier painted a similar subject [Le Chasseur] the > following year. Dorival has suggested that the treatment of the horses may > well be an important source for those of Duchamp-Villon in 1914. [...] In > his [1916] attempt to organize in plastic terms the abstract equivalent of > his earlier broad panoramas, Gleizes reverted to the tilting planes > reminiscent of smaller ones in such volumetric cubist works as The Hunt and > Jacques Nayral, both of 1911.

Guillaume Apollinaire has become an enthusiastic supporter of the new group. The result of the exhibition is a major scandal.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953 The public is outraged by the apparent obscurity of the subject matter, and the predominance of the elementary geometrical shapes, which give rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although the term 'cube' has been used before with respect to the works of Metzinger (1906), Delaunay and Metzinger (1907), and Georges Braque (1908), this is the first time the word 'Cubism' is used. The designation becomes widespread as an artistic movement.Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 11Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957. Reprinted, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Ampuis, 1997 The term \\"Cubisme\\" is accepted in June 1911 as the name of the new school by Guillaume Apollinaire, speaking in the context of the Brussels Indépendants which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Le Fauconnier and André Dunoyer de Segonzac. Over the Summer of 1911, Gleizes, living and working in Courbevoie, is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Gleizes paints Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon. The two have extensive conversations about the nature of form and perception. Both are discontent with classical perspective, which they feel give only a partial idea of the subject matter as experienced in life, seen in movement and from many different angles. =1911 Salon d'Automne= Albert Gleizes, 1911, Portrait de Jacques Nayral, oil on canvas, 161.9 x 114 cm, Tate Modern, London. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne Jean Metzinger, 1911, Le Goûter (Tea Time), oil on canvas, 75.9 x 70.2 cm (29 7/8 x 27 5/8 in.), Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne. André Salmon dubbed this painting \\"The Mona Lisa of Cubism\\" Following the Salon des Indépendants of early 1911, a new scandal is produced; this time in the Cubist room at the Salon d'Automne. Gleizes shows his Portrait de Jacques Nayral and La Chasse (The Hunt). Metzinger exhibits Le goûter (Tea Time). Other artists join the Salle 41 group: Roger de La Fresnaye, André Lhote, Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, František Kupka, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Francis Picabia, occupying rooms 7 and 8 of the salon. At about the time of this exhibition, through the intermediary of Apollinaire, Gleizes meets Picasso and sees his work along with that of Braque for the first time. He gives his reaction in an essay published in La Revue Indépendante. He considers that Picasso and Braque, despite the great value of their work, are engaged in an Impressionism of Form, i.e., they give an appearance of formal construction which does not rest on any clearly comprehensible principle. [...] We went to Kahnweiler's for the first time and saw the canvasses of Braque and Picasso which, rightly or wrongly, did not thrill us. Their spirit, being the opposite of our own. [...] And as far as Kahnweiler is concerned I never again put my foot in his boutique after this first visit in 1911.Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, La Revue Indépendante, n°4, September 1911 Through the Salon d'Automne, Gleizes becomes associated with the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7 rue Lemaître in the Parisian suburb Puteaux, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, a regular meeting places for the Cubist group. The Puteaux studios share a garden with the studio of František Kupka, the Czech painter who is developing a non- representational style based on music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion. The critic Jean Claude writes, in a review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne titled Cubistes, Triangulistes, Trapézoïdistes et Intentionnistes, published in Le Petit Journal: > There is a cubist art... Those who doubt can go into the room where enclosed > are the productions of wild beasts [fauves] who practice it... You will see > there the Paysage lacustre, by Le Fauconnier, the Jeune homme et Jeune fille > dans le printemps, mosaic of yellow, green, brown and pink, represented by > small trapezoids of color, juxtaposed, the Paysage and Goûter by Jean > Metzinger, classic cubist... A Marine by Lhote who invented the cubistic > water. A figure nue by de la Fresnaye, which seems made with wooden bricks, > and a mind-boggling Essai pour trois portraits by Fernand Léger. There too, > Gleizes, a Chasse and a Portrait, which I find deeply regrettable, because > the author, once, proved he had talent. Non of this would have any > importance if these horrors did not take up space that could be usefully > occupied by other works, and if, above all, a few snobs did not offer them > to the crowds as the last canons of modern beauty.

Gallica, > Bibliothèque nationale de FranceTate, London, Albert Gleizes, Portrait de > Jacques Nayral, 1911 Art market Gleizes had always detested the art market falsified by a speculation on works of art imposed by the fantasy of fictitious bids to push up the prices in the public sales. When Léonce Rosenberg, whom Gleizes found the most sympathetic of the art dealers, offered to push up the price of his pre-war painting La Chasse, which was coming up for auction. Gleizes replied that he preferred to buy it himself and therefore wanted the price to be as low as possible.

The case is a reference to the private Mexico City shelter 'Casitas del Sur' from which 126 children were rescued in January 2009. In addition to the 'Casitas del Sur' shelter, minors were reported missing from Centro de Adaptación e Integración Familiar A.C. (CAIFAC) in Monterrey, Nuevo León and from \\"La Casita\\" in Cancún, Quintana Roo. As of March 2012, fourteen children remained missing. The missing children are allegedly abducted for religious indoctrination, illegal adoptions, organ trafficking, and trafficking of children. The Attorney General of Mexico offers a $1.2 million reward for information leading to the location and recovery of the missing children. The case is the subject of the book Se venden niños by investigative journalist Sanjuana Martínez. La Jornada journalist Carlos Martínez García was granted protective measures after receiving threats for his report on the case.  Ilse Michell  A rally for the missing children. The case began to surface in 2005, when irregularities in La Casita shelter in Cancún were reported. The case became more publicized in late 2008 when ten-year-old Ilse Michel Curiel Martínez was not found in the Casitas del Sur shelter. In 2005 Martinez was taken to a temporary shelter of the Mexico City Attorney General’s Office (PGJDF) due to an alleged case of domestic violence. She was sent to the Casitas del Sur shelter while the case was settled in the court. When the charges were dropped, the judge requested the release of the minor to her grandmother but shelter staff rejected the request. On 31 October 2008, government officials went to the property to request the release of the minor, but their entry was denied. After obtaining a search warrant, police entered the facility to look for the minor but were unable to find her. Police suspect the minor had been transferred to the state of Morelos. Local PAN congressman Agustín Castilla Marroquín filed a criminal complaint against the director of the temporary shelter, Lorena González, that transferred Ilse Michell to Casitas del Sur and demanded that she be relieved of her duties for her possible involvement in the case. González denied having transferred the child to Casitas del Sur saying it was the responsibility of the district attorney's office. When a second girl was reported missing on 27 January 2009, local PAN congressman Agustín Castilla charged public officials with negligence and complicity saying personnel from the District Attorney's office warned the shelter of the searches so that the minors could be removed from the facilities.  Rescued children  On 29 January 2009 when at least four parents complained of being forbidden to see their children, over 30 unarmed police officers, social workers, and staff from the Human Rights Commission entered two Casitas del Sur facilities disguised as nurses to confuse shelter staff and to prevent the children from panicking. Seven shelter employees objected with shouts to the release of the minors, causing the children to go on a frenzy, screaming, crying, and chanting apocalyptic phrases and accusing their rescuers of being corrupt. The children repeated phrases such as \\"Here only the almighty God exists, and here it all ends\\", leading officials to believe that the minors were encouraged to participate in a mass suicide. Police believed the children were subjected to severe religious indoctrination and transferred the 126 minors to the National System for Integral Family Development to undergo medical and psychological studies. The children were reluctant to provide information to psychologists. Officials discovered that children received no outside schooling and were forced to participate in long hours of prayer. A rescued girl initially identified herself as Martinez, but later identified as another minor. DNA tests performed on the minor gave a negative result. The seven shelter employees with arrested and charged with obstruction of justice. On June 6, 2014 Ilse Michel arrived alone in a taxi to the offices of the National System for Integral Family Development in Ecatepec, Mexico. She reunited with her grandmother after spending five years with a couple who told her she had been abandoned. As of March 2014, eight children remain missing.

Shortly after his arrival in Mexico he enrolled in the architecture program of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México but dropped out two years later. He devoted himself to painting instead, becoming self-taught. He had an art career that spanned over fifty years, remaining active in this work until his death. Gandía died on March 9, 2009 from a heart attack in Cuernavaca just short of his 75th birthday. He was survived by his wife, Andrea Velasco, and two children, Antonio Gandía and Xihuitl Mariana, the former eventually having 3 kids of his own, Damian, Thomas, and Leo, making them Vicente's only grandchildren. Vicente's son, Antonio married Christina Gandía in 2015. Career His career has mostly been in painting but has also done various other types of works such as print making, sculpting, ceramics and jewelry design. He began by drawing interiors of buildings in the 1950s while still an architecture student. After leaving architecture, he work on various projects until his big break in painting in 1968. Since then, his work with its simple iconography became popular internationally. His first exhibition as an artist was in 1954 at the Instituto de Cultura Hispánica in Guadalajara. He had numerous individual shows at venues in Mexico and abroad such as the Columbia Museum of Art in 1968 and 1973, the Chastenet European Center, London in 1976, the Kimberley Gallery, Washington in 1987, the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1988, Capella de l’Antic Hospital in Barcelona in 1990, Galerie Palette Roderhaus Wuppertal in Wuppertal, the Galerie du Palais de la Culture, Algiers in 1991, and the Museo Español de Arte Contemporáneo, Madrid in 1993. His international exhibitions led to a marked increase in demand for his work and invitation to exhibit. Gandía has also participated in over 100 collective exhibitions in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Israel, Puerto Rico, Argentina and Europe. Gandía’s work can be found in the collections of the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Santiago Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museu de la Diputacio in Barcelona, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Toluca, the Biblioteca P. Arango in Bogota, the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña in San Juan, the Biblioteca Emilio A. Carrafa in Córdoba, Argentina, the Museo de Monterrey, the Pinoteca de la Dirección General del Registro de la Propriedad in Mexico City and the Banamex collection. None canvas work includes the stained glass of the Capilla de Beneficiencia Francesa y Belga in Coyoacán and the mosaic mural at the Palacio Municipal of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Gandía also worked as a graphic and commercial designer, with magazines such as El Zaguán, Naturaleza and Universidad de México. Gandía’s recognitions for his work include an honorary mention from the Salón de Grabado event of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana in 1970 and first prize at the same event in 1971. He was also accepted as a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. In 1994 the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia held a retrospective of his work at the Palacio de Cortés in Cuernavaca. Just after the artist’s death, a retrospective and homage was held at the Museo Gene Bryon in the city of Guanajuato as part of the Festival Internacional Cervantino, and a year later in 2010, a retrospective was held at the Galería del Seminario de la Cultura Mexicana in Cuernavaca. Artistry Although he worked in a number of techniques such as murals, graphic art and even some cinema, most of his work and his best work is oil on canvas, done in a principally figurative and naturalist style. His work in art grew out the drawing of interiors from his architecture days. He was a self-taught artist, with his initial influences being from André Masson . By 1974, his work had developed its own distinctive cues in its depiction of the natural world. By the end of the 1970s, these cues had refined themselves such that while certain elements reappeared, they never did so in the same way. For the rest of his career, he continued with this trajectory, but integrating different influences such as those from the work of Francisco de Zurbarán, Goya, Monet, Édouard Manet, Juan Gris and Pierre Bonnard and especially Cézanne and Matisse, which his best work from critical standpoint from the late 1960s through the 1980s. However, there was a brief period from 1996 to 1999, where he abandoned his figurative style and focus on buildings and nature to experiment with abstract art. This was prompted by the artist’s interest in the work of Eduardo Chillida, Esteban Vicente, Antoni Tàpies, Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Franz Kline and Joan Miró. The stage only lasted for three years, which included new colors along with new forms. Gandía then returned to his former style, but adding more variation than before in what was depicted and how, with intense colors. His style was based on simple objects, eliminating excessive rhetoric in his work and the modulation of space. He created landscapes, scenes of houses, greenhouses, patios, labyrinths, flowers, fruits and the homes he lived in over the years, with elements that seem to move. Notable examples of his work include Silla en jardín (1988) and El oscuro splendor (1994). His work does not make any major breaks with the art traditions of Europe, but does add new twists and even some elements that contradict the aesthetics of his main later influences of Cézanne and Matisse. Works such as Las suecas, Bodegón rosa and Dos botellas show the fascination Gandía had for form and color and how the two interact. Poet Eliseo Diego wrote for the exhibition catalogue for the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1988, “The work of Vicente Gandía is part of the best tradition of Spanish painting. Its starts out from real, solid things, and makes them glow from within, as though with the hidden splendor of their true essence.” His work shows detail and thought in his depiction of architecture, especially elements such as pillars, doors, windows, and the surrounding landscaping. Raquel Tibol wrote that he produced paintings of “excellent technique and musical delicacy, with a knowing balance between form and color.” References Category:Mexican artists Category:1935 births Category:2009 deaths ","title":"Vicente Gandía"},{"id":"40085495","text":"Strider, known in Japan as , is a platform-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Double Helix Games and Capcom's Osaka studio. It was released in February 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. It is a reboot of the 1989 video game Strider.  Gameplay  The player control the series' main character, Strider Hiryu. The environment is freely explorable in search for weapons and items. Strider Hiryu's main weapon is his Cypher, a plasma weapon that can take several properties. Upgrades for the Cypher can be obtained by exploring Kazakh.  Plot  The Strider organization sends their best assassin, Hiryu, to kill the villain, Grandmaster Meio, in the metropolis of Kazakh City. The game is a retelling of the \\"core Strider story\\" and its common theme which centers around Hiryu's battle against Grandmaster Meio. The game mixes together elements from the first arcade Strider game, the NES console game, Strider 2, his Marvel vs. Capcom fighting game appearances, and the original manga from Moto Kikaku.  Development  In 2009, a Strider reboot was in development by Grin. However, due to financial difficulties that bankrupted the company, the game was cancelled. Development of the 2014 game was made possible thanks to the series' popularity especially in thanks to Capcom's surveys and forums. Strider was announced by Capcom in July 2013 during the San Diego Comic-Con. Capcom found Double Helix could work well with their Osaka studio which handled the character designs and game design. Producers from the game commented they wanted to make the classic Strider games less linear and expand their length to satisfy current generation's players. Due to the character's popularity, developers want him to retain all of his abilities from the first and second Strider games but at the same time encourage the players to obtain new skills in order to progress and provide more variety. This was how the team had the idea of giving Cypher the power to change forms. Additionally, the team wanted to contrast other games that start with the character completely powered up just to remove most of his skills in the game's beginning. Kouichi Yotsui, also known as \\"Isuke\\" and original designer of the first arcade version of Strider, was not involved in the development of the 2014 game but gave his blessing by giving his prayers to Capcom USA. One of the staff's main influences is the video game Shadow Complex as producer Andrew Szymanski wanted Strider to imitate the game's balance between combat, speed and exploration. The action in the reboot is eight times faster than the original game, making this balance one of the staff's greatest challenges. Hiryu's appearances in the Marvel vs. Capcom series also influenced the character's gameplay mechanics. The game's soundtrack features multiple homages to classic Strider themes but with several modifications. The sound quality is also meant to resemble the music from the original games. Reception Strider received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the PlayStation 3 version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Adam Beck of Hardcore Gamer said of the PlayStation 4 version, \\"Double Helix has done a phenomenal job in bringing the futuristic ninja into the modern day by not only upgrading the visuals while maintaining the two-dimension plane, but adding an addictive and well-constructed progression structure to keep the campaign interesting.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS3 and PS4 versions each a score of one nine, two eights, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40. 411Mania gave the PS3 version a score of 8.2 out of 10 and said it was \\"a nice update of the franchise for the modern era. It's far from a groundbreaking game, but as a $15 downloadable title, it's fun throwback to traditional action games of the 1980s and 90s.\\" The Escapist gave the Xbox One version four stars out of five and called it \\"a stellar example of how to remake a classic. It sticks to the original where it should, and modernizes where the classic formula can be improved.\\" GameZone gave the game a score of eight out of ten and said that it's \\"out on so many different consoles, so there's no excuse not to give it a try. At 4-6 hours of gameplay your first run, plus all the challenge modes, the $14.99 price tag is very reasonable. The game can definitely feel repetitive but you can always mix up your play style, and there's plenty of room for variety.\\" Slant Magazine gave the PS4 version four stars out of five and said, \\"The less resilient player can and will die more than they have in quite some time; the good ones will be just as excited going back for more after the hundredth Game Over as they were at the first.\\" The Digital Fix similarly gave the same console version eight out of ten and said it was \\"a game that will succeed on its own merits and not by comparison to the original.\\" Digital Spy gave it a similar score of four stars out of five and said it was \\"admirably true to the game that Capcom released on arcades in 1989 and will delight those who still hold a candle for the original, with its unaltered core gameplay and polished production values. With these qualities on side, it's easy to overlook the game's shortcomings and deem it worthy of the Strider name.\\" National Post likewise gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"a great meaty throwback worth the $15 offer price.\\" Metro, however, gave it a score of seven out of ten and said, \\"The mixture of old school, new school, and Metroidvania works surprisingly well – even if Strider's long-awaited reboot still feels slightly too safe.\\" Edge gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of seven out of ten and called it \\"a sensitive update for a series many thought would stay stuck in the past.\\" The game reached #5 in the European sales charts, and #1 in the United States.

Retrieved 27 July 2013 Following the thefts the porch and south aisle were re-roofed in stainless steel coated with terne. Architecture =Exterior= St Nicholas is of ashlar-faced limestone and rubble construction, with roofs of lead, slate, and terne-coated stainless steel. It comprises a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, tower, and a south porch, and is of Norman and Perpendicular styles. The west tower is Perpendicular style of three stages surmounted on its parapet by eight crocketed pinnacles, one at each corner and one along each side at the centre. The bases of the corner pinnacles contain grotesque gargoyles. The centre pinnacles sit on triangular projections that run below the parapet, with grotesque corbels at their base that intersect with the hood mould arch-- moulded arch projections against the wall--above the belfry openings on the tower third stage. The belfry openings are of four lights each, twin-tiered and louvered, topped with trefoil openings. The 13th-century tower lower stage is supported by buttresses at the centre of each wall, its socle, or plinth, topped by a scotia, or rolled moulding. Within the tower north wall middle stage is embedded a fragment of Anglo-Saxon sculpture. The tower contains six bells, and a clock offset to the north on its east face.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John: The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire pp. 33, 75, 533-534. Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press. The Perpendicular clerestory windows north and south are 15th-century, each with three lights, topped with cinquefoil moulded surrounds, and edged above with hood moulding. Part of a blocked roundel window, above the east bay of the south arcade, is evidence of earlier circular 10th-century clerestory windows. The clerestory parapet is horizontally straight, set with a raised latticework frieze with quatrefoil moulding, and shields within the alternate central rhombus devices. Upon the parapet and between the windows are crocketed pinnacles supported by reused 15th-century grotesque corbels, below which are roof drain holes. The unusual pinnacle on the south-east corner of the nave is referred to by Pevsner: \\"But what is the strange en-crusted canopy at the SE corner\\". This pinnacle is a representation of the arms of the Myddleton family, Fulbeck manor owners of the 15th century, and includes a Wyvern and Harpy supporting a shield containing a lion rampant, surmounted by a Saracen's head. The south porch dates from the 14th century, is gabled, with side windows and side stone benches. The north and south aisle roofs are both 19th-century. The south aisle pointed-arch east window of three lights, and the south wall's two windows of four lights, are all 14th-century, and contain trefoil heads and quatrefoils, with hood mould surrounds. =Interior= St Nicholas' accommodates seating for 356. The 15th-century tower arch comprises two half columns supporting a moulded pointed arch. Partially surrounding the arch is a hood mould, finishing at its base with carved leaf label stops. The upper part of the arch, within the tower, contains the church organ. Within the tower are 15th-century stairs to the belfry, accessed by an 18th-century timber arched door. The stairs ascend the west side of the tower and are lit by a Perpendicular window of three lights. The middle stage of the tower is lit by two pointed arched 19th-century windows at the south. Above the tower arch are raised indications of the roof line of the Saxon nave, steeply pointed, with the remains of coping stones and quoins showing the extent of the earlier church. The chancel and chancel arch show the complete Kirk restoration of 1888--the restored and enlarged chancel arch is of 14th-century style. Most chancel fittings are from the 19th and 20th century. However, the chancel retains a sedilia at the south, dating from the 13th century, although restored. In the north wall is a recess, originally for a tomb, which contains an iron bound chest of the 16th century. At the north is a credence table, or shelf, constructed from a 12th-century capital. Choir seating from the 15th- century was used to provide two existing chancel seats which contain original misericords. A former altarpiece, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, is in the style of Stothard. The chancel east window, by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, is contemporary with the Kirk restoration, noted by Pevsner as \\"the beautiful five-light chancel E window in the style of 1300\\". Further 19th-century chancel windows are of two lights, and by William Wailes, with one by O'Connor, and in the same 14th-century style. Label stops depicting human heads are found on all the interior nave and aisle window arches. Behind the pulpit, and in the north wall of the nave, is a fragment of a 12th-century arcade--Pevsner believes the fragment could also be a part of a square font-- and above it, a 15th-century arched opening to a previous roof loft. The nave arcades are 13th-century. They define three bays north and south, and are of double-chamfered arches and round piers. The south aisle east window, part of the Kirk restoration, is Perpendicular, other windows Decorated period, although \\"over-restored\\" (Pevsner). Within the south aisle is a 14th-century piscina, and brackets for statues. The north and south doorways are of c.1300. The north doorway is pointed with heavy moulding, and the south the same but including a hood mould. The 14th-century south door is of paneled oak with an ogee-headed wicket door inset. To the west of the south door interior is a 17th-century alms box. The church font is of late 12th-century Transitional period, drum shaped, with an octagonal pier on each corner of a square plinth. Between each set of piers are five narrower twisted columns surmounted by intersecting arches. Around the font rim runs a cable moulding, with leaf mouldings dropped below on three sides, and dog-tooth moulding on the fourth. Pevsner describes the font as \\"a splendid piece, due, however, perhaps to re- tooling\\". National Heritage states that it was \\"heavily recut in the 19th century\\". Church plate includes a 1626 chalice and cover, and a 1724 paten. Memorials Church monuments and plaques arranged along the north aisle and north chancel are chiefly dedicated to the Fane family from the late 17th century onwards, while those on the south are dedicated to others. South aisle monuments includes that to Elizabeth Shaw (died 1736), in cartouche form with cherubs and urn. A monument to Elizabeth Brown (died 1683) contains a cartouche with coat of arms and broken pediment. A 1680 slab at the south aisle west window commemorates Timothy Thorold (died 1641), described as a \\"Dr. of Physick\\", and his family. Of the Fane memorials in the north aisle, the earliest is to Neville Fane (died 1680), being a curved-top slab with an urn on a plinth with painted heraldic shields. A slab memorial is dedicated to Thomas Ball, servant of Sir Francis Fane, inscribed: > In Memory of Thomas Ball Who dyed the 10th day of February, 1673 in the 74th > year Of his Age.

Early years  Fomicheva was born in Moscow, but spent her entire childhood in Znamenka village (Dankovsky District, Lipetsk Oblast). Her father died in a year after her birth and later her elder brother Valentin, who was the primary breadwinner of the family after father's death, also died, so the family suffered severe material hardships. In 1931 after graduating from a 7-year comprehensive school she was hired as a bookkeeper's apprentice while studying in a banking school. Upon graduation she became an accounting associate in the Gosbank. She took pleasure in hiking, mountaineering and other sports. In 1936 Fomicheva joined glider club. Her skills were so good in it that she was invited to participate at the paramilitary flying club. By 1938 she was qualified as a flight instructor and in 1938-1941 trained young people in a flying club in Reutov.  Military career  = Second World War = On 22 June 1941, the first day the Third Reich invaded the USSR, Fomicheva volunteered for the frontline flying service and was accepted by the 122nd Aviation Group - a special women's unit under the command of Marina Raskova. Initially she opted to train as a fighter pilot but Raskova, after examination of her abilities, decided to assign her to the 587th Bombardment Aviation Regiment, intended to operate the Sukhoi Su-2 light bomber. The regiment later received the Guards designation and was renamed the 125th Guards Dive Bomber Regiment. She took her military and tactical training in the Engels Military Flying School in the Saratov Oblast. The unit ended up using Petlyakov Pe-2 bombers instead of Sukhoi Su-2 light bombers. By January 1943, when the 587th first engaged in combat, Fomicheva was a flight commander and the vice- commander of her squadron. Later she took command of the squadron. On 17 September 1943, Fomicheva's aircraft was damaged by enemy flak and her face was wounded by fragments of the cockpit's glazing. Since her navigator was severely wounded and incapable of bailing out, Fomicheva could not leave the aircraft and had to land it on the airfield of a Soviet fighter unit near the frontline. There was an aircraft on the main runway, so she made the landing beside the main runway. When the landing run a wheel of Fomicheva's aircraft got into a bomb crater, the plane nosed-over and caught fire. Fomicheva suffered severe injuries (including fractures in six ribs) and burns. Airfield personnel helped the crew escape the burning aircraft. By January 1944, Fomicheva recovered from her injuries and resumed flying.Hero of the Soviet Union Recommendation On 23 June 1944, in the second sortie of the day, Fomicheva's aircraft was hit by enemy flak when approaching the target, setting the left engine aflame and killing her gunner. Fomicheva herself had her leg severely wounded but continued the mission and dropped the bombs on the target. She then turned the burning aircraft back towards the frontline to avoid capture by the enemy, flying until she got over friendly territory. She bailed out at an altitude of no more than 200 meters, but not before making sure that her navigator Galina Dzhunkovskaya successfully parachuted to safety. Both she and Dzhunkovskaya suffered serious burns. On 15 July 1944, Fomicheva resumed flying. By December, 1944, Fomicheva had flown 55 combat missions with 46,750 kg of bombs dropped. Her subordinates and superiors appreciated her performance as a pilot and as a squadron commander, as she was instrumental in a number of instances in reducing or preventing losses of aircrew. She also was responsible for missions critical for the success of ground forces' operations by destroying valuable enemy assets and targets On 23 December 1944 Fomicheva's command recommended her for the title of the Hero of Soviet Union, which she received on 18 August 1945. = Postwar = After the war Fomicheva served as an instructor at the Air Force Academy and later at Borisoglebsk Military Flying School. By 1955 she retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but she died only a few years later on 5 October 1958 after a prolonged illness that left her beddridden; she was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.  Involvement in politics  Fomicheva became a member of the Communist Party in 1944, and in 1945 she participated in the founding WIDF congress in Paris.

In the year 1897, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy decided to send a group of nuns to care for the children who had been traumatised, abandoned and orphaned by the Famine and this is what brought the nuns to Pakistan. By 1906 the Great Famine ended and the number of children decreased, the dome rooms which once composed the orphanage were left empty. At that time, financial support from abroad was withdrawn and making ends meet became difficult. It was thus that the unoccupied rooms transformed into Sacred Heart School. A notice was placed in the newspapers by Sister Marie de la Trinite Lootens to announce the opening of an all girls school for both borders and day scholars from affluent families. The children from all creeds were welcomed. The school taught not only Hindu but also those from the Muslim, Parsee and Christian faiths.

Roth was a contributing member of the only basketball team in NCAA history to win both the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) and NCAA Tournament in the same season. Roth was one of four sophomore starters on the CCNY squad that defeated Bradley in both championship games. Roth was 6'4\\", weighed 210 pounds and played guard. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York and attended Erasmus Hall High School, where as a senior in 1947–48 he led them to a PSAL championship. Due to his poor academic grades, Roth was ineligible to attend CCNY his freshman year; one year later Roth was admitted to the school as a sophomore. It was this season that CCNY won both national basketball championships (the NIT was actually considered the premier national championship at the time). One year later, news broke about a point-shaving scandal that was sweeping east coast universities, and at its heart was CCNY's squad led by Nat Holman. Roth was one of the players arrested in the scandal and agreed to serve in the United States Army for a time in exchange for suspending his jail sentence. Roth's admission into CCNY despite his poor grades was a result of transcript altering by Holman. Nationally, all of the players who were convicted of participating in the scandal were banned from ever playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Due to this, Roth played for a time in the Eastern League. After his playing days, Roth went back to CCNY to earn his business degree, then moved to the suburbs of New York City to sell insurance.

History Mandatory military service has been employed several times over the course of Philippine history. =Spanish Empire= During Spanish colonial rule, Filipinos were drafted for military service and deployed as auxiliary forces both in local and foreign campaigns of the Spanish Empire. One author states that the Spanish friars supervised the conscription of parishioners into the colonial army. The Spaniards evidently commended the Filipinos' military service, citing them as excellent soldiers in campaigns such as the taking of Ternate. During the first phase of the Philippine Revolution (1896-1897), more than 17,000 native Filipinos were in the Spanish order of battle, 60% of which were made up of members of the Guardia Civil. =Philippine Commonwealth= Conscription was introduced prior to World War II during the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 with a term of enlistment of 5 and a half months. President Manuel L. Quezon issued Executive Order No. 207 in 1939 in order to implement the National Defense Act of 1935, otherwise known as Commonwealth Act No. 1, the embodiment of the national defense plan formulated by General Douglas MacArthur for the Philippine Commonwealth. This executive order made ROTC obligatory at all colleges and universities with a total enrollment of 100 students and greater. This measure was made in order to help fill out the reserve force requirement of 400,000 men by 1946 and especially for junior reserve officers. However, after a trip to Tokyo in 1939, Quezon concluded that Japan was much too powerful and that the Filipinos could not effectively defend their homeland. He therefore curtailed MacArthur's military preparedness program by halting conscription and reducing by half the number of reserves in training. =Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos= Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on 21 September 1972. He issued at least two Presidential Decrees governing the terms of conscription of trainees into selective emergency military service, one for a period of 12 months in 1973 and another for a period of 18 months in 1974. =Present day= Conscription remains a possibility as Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of the Philippines states: In addition, the National Service Training Program, instituted by virtue of Republic Act 9163, is a training program for national service, wherein both male and female college students of any baccalaureate degree course or technical vocational course in public or private educational institutions are obliged to undergo one of three program components for an academic period of two semesters.

Till's murder was a watershed moment in the Civil Rights Movement. Louis testified in court about what he had seen, but an all-white jury found the men not guilty. Fearing for his life, Louis moved to Chicago after the trial and changed his name from Willie Reed to Willie Louis. He was interviewed in 2003 for the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till and was interviewed the next year on the CBS News television program 60 Minutes. Early years Willie Reed, as Willie Louis was then known, was born in 1937 in Greenwood, Mississippi at the eastern edge of the Mississippi Delta. He was raised in Drew, Mississippi, by his grandparents who worked as sharecroppers. Reed received little formal education and worked in the cotton fields. The Emmett Till case =Witness to murder= Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. He was a 14-year-old African-American from Chicago who was reportedly murdered for having reportedly flirted with and whistled at a 21-year-old white woman in a grocery store. The case and subsequent trial have been called \\"watershed moments in the civil rights movement, galvanizing public attention on the deep perils of being black in the Jim Crow South.\\" On the morning of Sunday, August 28, 1955, Reed, who was then 18 years old, was walking on a dirt road near Drew, Mississippi, when he saw a green-and-white Chevrolet pick-up drive past him with four white men in the front and three African-American men and an African-American youth seated with his back to the cab. Reed recognized two of the men in the front seat as Roy Bryant, the husband of the woman who Till had reportedly whistled at, and J.W. Milam, Bryant's half-brother. Reed saw the truck pull into a plantation owned by Milam's brother and park in front of a barn. As he walked closer, he heard a boy inside the barn yelling, \\"Mama, save me!\\" He also heard the sounds of blows landing on a body and voices cursing and yelling, \\"Get down, you black bastard.\\" Reed ran to the nearby house of Amanda Bradley and told her what he had seen and heard. Reed and another individual were sent to get water from a well near the barn. As they did, they heard the continuing sound of the beating until the cries became fainter and then stopped. As Reed walked back toward the Bradley house, Milam emerged from the barn with a pistol at his side. Milam confronted Reed and asked if he had seen or heard anything. Reed told Milam that he had not. Reed returned to the Bradley house and watched from a window as the men in the barn loaded what appeared to be a body into the pick-up truck. =Decision to testify= On August 31, 1955, Till's lynched body was discovered in the Tallahatchie River. The body showed signs that Till had been brutally beaten and shot in the head. Reed saw a photograph of Till in the newspaper and recognized him as the youth who he had seen hunkered down in the truck. Bryant and Milam were arrested for the murder, but Reed's grandfather warned Reed that he would be risking his safety if he spoke up. Louis was later approached by civil rights workers who persuaded him to testify in court. To ensure his safety, Reed went into hiding until the trial. When Reed arrived at the courthouse to testify in the middle of September 1955, he was met by a \\"thicket of Klansmen massed outside the courthouse.\\" Reed testified at the trial. He was shown a picture of Till and testified that it looked like the boy he had seen in the back of the truck. He also identified Milam and testified that he saw Milam come out of the barn to get a drink of water and then return to the barn.Metress, pp. 81-83. In his closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed Reed's testimony, noting that if Willie had been lying, the defense would have had needed 50 lawyers to discredit him. The prosecutor argued they couldn't do that \\"because Willie Reed was telling the truth.\\" He finished by saying, \\"I don't know but what Willie Reed has more nerve than I have.Metress, pp. 108-109. Despite Reed's testimony and other evidence, Bryant and Milam were found not guilty after an hour of deliberation by an all-white jury. =Reaction to the trial= In the aftermath of the trial, some suggested that Reed had not been a good witness, noting that he had given inconsistent accounts as to how far he was from Milam and whether he really recognized him. Even Till's mother later said that \\"Little Willie Reed\\" was \\"not a good witness.\\" She added, \\"Willie Reed had a story, but he couldn't tell it. It was locked inside him. It would have taken education to put the key in the lock and turn it loose. Every word that was gotten from Willie had to be pulled out word by word. That's because Willie is 18 years old and has probably been to school only 3 years.\\" Others had a more positive reaction to Reed's testimony. The Jackson Daily News described his testimony as \\"the most damaging introduced thus far\\" and as having \\"electrified the court.\\"Houck, p. 93. The New York Times later wrote that Reed's testimony \\"made him a hero\\" of the Civil Rights Movement. The Daily Worker published an article titled \\"The Shame of Our Nation\\" expressing outrage at the result but praising Reed and other witnesses as \\"heroes of the Negro people ... who stood up in court and in defiance of a white supremacist code fearlessly gave their testimony.\\"Metress, p. 118. Historian David T. Beito said of Reed: \\"He was really the best eyewitness that they found ... [H]is act in some sense was the bravest act of them all. He had nothing to gain: he had no family ties to Emmett Till; he didn't know him. He was this 18-year-old kid who goes into this very hostile atmosphere.\\" Later years After testifying in the Till case, Reed moved to Chicago and changed his name from Willie Reed to Willie Louis. He was employed as an orderly at Woodlawn Hospital and later at Jackson Park Hospital. In 1976, he was married to Juliet Louis, who was a nursing aide at Jackson Park. Louis remained silent about his role in the Emmett Till case. His wife did not even learn of his connection to the case until 1984. His wife recalled, \\"he didn't talk about it much.\\" In 2003, Louis was located and interviewed by Stanley Nelson, who later wrote a book and produced a documentary on the case. Nelson's documentary, The Murder of Emmett Till, was broadcast on PBS television in the United States and included an interview with Louis. Nelson later said: > Willie Reed stood up, and with incredible bravery pointed out the people who > had taken and murdered Emmett Till. He was from Mississippi, and somewhere > in his heart of hearts he had to know that these people would not be > convicted. But he did what he had to do. Thereafter, Louis met Till's mother and began speaking in public about the case. In 2004, he was interviewed on the CBS News television show 60 Minutes. During the interview on 60 Minutes, Louis explained his reasoning in deciding to testify: \\"I couldn't have walked away from that. Emmett was 14, probably had never been to Mississippi in his life, and he come to visit his grandfather and they killed him. I mean, that's not right.\\" In July 2013, Louis died of intestinal bleeding at age 76 in Oak Lawn, Illinois.

Named for the Algoma District of Ontario, it served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war it was sold to the Venezuelan Navy and renamed Constitución. Background Flower-class corvettes like Algoma serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Algoma was ordered 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower class building program. She was laid down on 18 June 1940 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. in Port Arthur, Ontario, and launched on 17 December 1940. Commissioned on 11 July 1941 in Montreal, Quebec, she arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 18 July 1940 to begin her career. Atlantic service Algoma served as an ocean escort until May 1942, participating in two severe U-boat attacks on convoys ONS 67 and ONS 92. She was an original member of MOEF Escort Group A-3 (EG A-3). She was replaced in the group by corvettes Mayflower and Trillium. Algoma then went in for refit, which took six weeks to complete. Upon returning to active service in July, she joined WLEF. She was assigned to Operation Torch convoys, where she took part in convoy SC 107, which lost fifteen ships. Algoma was then placed under command of the Royal Navy, escorting convoys to the Mediterranean Sea. She was then returned to the Atlantic as a member of first Western Support Force and then a return to the WLEF, followed by a period with the Quebec Force. She did one quick tour with EG C-4 before arriving at Liverpool, Nova Scotia, for a major refit. Algoma returned to service in May 1944, joining EG C-5. She performed three round- trips with convoys before joining EG 41 under the command of the Royal Navy's Plymouth Command. She spent the rest of the war patrolling the English Channel. Postwar service Algoma was paid off on 6 July 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia, for disposal. She was purchased by the Venezuelan Navy in 1946 and renamed ARV Constitución. She was discarded in 1962.

Personal life and education De Henriquez was born in Trieste to a father descended from Spanish noblemen of the Habsburg court in Vienna; her mother was of Turkish and Russian origin. She had one older brother, Diego, who went on to found the War Museum in Trieste. De Henriquez studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia under Arturo Martini. As a teenager she was a member of the Fascist Youth Movement, but during the Second World War she worked with the partisan movement and helped escort Jewish refugees to safety. This was due in part to her father's denunciation in 1935 as an anti-Fascist, for refusing to Italianise his surname. In 1949, she left Italy for England, and became a British citizen in 1953; she would live there for much of the rest of her life. However, she also returned often to her native Italy. In 1966, she purchased the ruinous hamlet of Peralta in Tuscany, and spent much time on its restoration as an artists' colony. De Henriquez was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, and declared herself \\"proud to be hermaphrodite\\" and \\"two people inside one body\\". She had a brief relationship with German painter Kurt Kramer in the 1940s, but her primary romantic and sexual relationships were with women. De Henriquez affected an offbeat style of dress; in his diaries, Christopher Isherwood described her as appearing \\"dressed like a male peasant in Cavalleria Rusticana and announc[ing] that she had a love for life.\\" Career She held her exhibition debut in Florence in 1947. Following her move to Britain, she exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1950. In 1951, she produced work to commemorate the Festival of Britain, for which she earned the then enormous fee of £4,000. From the late 1950s until 1975 she spent a few months each year touring North America, working and lecturing. She had two further solo shows in Rome in 1975 and 1983. De Henriquez created portrait sculptures of a wide range of individuals, including Igor Stravinsky, Margot Fonteyn, Augustus John, Peter Ustinov, John F. Kennedy, Vivien Leigh, the Queen Mother, Oprah Winfrey and Laurence Olivier. Towards the end of the 1970s, she began to travel in East Asia, and carried out commissions for clients in Japan and Hong Kong. She was a prolific artist, and known to have created some 4000 portraits between 1948 and her death in 2004. She also worked in other areas of sculpture, such as the monumental fountain of dolphins which was erected in a courtyard at the World Intellectual Property Organization headquarters in Geneva. De Henriquez's gender identity informed much of her work, with its recurring motifs of paired heads, conjoined figures, and ambiguous mythological creatures. Much of her early work was in the primitive mode. From the early 1960s, her friendship with cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz encouraged her to experiment with looser forms.

He retired as president and CEO in July 2017 when former Congressman Tim Huelskamp took over those roles in the organization. Bast continues to serve on Heartland's Board of Directors. Biography Bast was born on January 22, 1958 in Kimberly, Wisconsin where he attended a Catholic elementary school. He studied economics at the University of Chicago but dropped out of school in order to devote more time to the Heartland Institute. Bast married Diane Bast, who grew up with him in Kimberly. In 1984, David Padden founded the Heartland Institute — an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank — and put Bast in charge of the nascent organization. Bast has been president and CEO ever since. \\"Personally, I'm a fallen-away libertarian. I place a high value on individual freedom and I tend to look at most issues from that perspective. But I'm not sure it is the only way anymore,\\" Bast told the Chicago Tribune in 1995. Bast is one of the editors of the Climate Change Reconsidered series by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). He was also involved in the creation of the State Policy Network, and has written several books, some of which challenge mainstream claims about cigarette smoking. In 2014, he co-authored an article entitled \\"The Myth of the Climate Change '97%'\\" in the Wall Street Journal along with Roy Spencer which argued that the oft-cited claim that \\"97% of the world's scientists believe climate change is an urgent problem\\" is misleading because the figure is derived from surveys with small sample sizes, and the questionnaire conflates belief in negligible global warming with belief in dangerous global warming. A 2011 article in Nature criticized his position on global warming and second-hand smoke. The Heartland Institute As president of the Heartland Institute, Bast manages the Institute's finances, helps organize and introduce its annual conference on climate change, and sets its research and communications agenda. Bast is a regular speaker at the Heartland Institute's annual conference on climate change. Bast and his wife, executive editor Diane Bast, publish four monthly public policy newspapers that are distributed to elected officials: School Reform News, Health Care News, Budget & Tax News, and Environment & Climate News. Bast told Bloomberg News that the Heartland Institute does not deny climate change, but they are skeptical of the scientific consensus that man- made global warming is a significant danger to the planet. The Heartland Institute also believes that many of the policies to fight global warming would be damaging to the economy. According to Nature, Bast does not necessarily deny that humans are having an influence on the climate, but he does question the forecasts of catastrophic impacts and the rationale for curbing carbon emissions. Bast argues that the costs of trying to prevent global warming exceed the benefits. In a Wall Street Journal interview, Bast said that he believes the climate has warmed in the second half of the 20th Century and there is likely a measurable human impact on climate. He believes the human impact on global warming is likely very small and that minimal warming is not a crisis. According to Bloomberg News, Bast's skepticism of the dangers posed by global warming have made him \\"a favorite bogeyman of environmentalists.\\" In 2012, Bast signed off on a widely criticized ad campaign that compared global warming believers to the Unabomber.

Originally the theorem was about maximal subgroups of the symmetric group. It appeared as an appendix to a paper by Leonard Scott written for The Santa Cruz Conference on Finite Groups in 1979, with a footnote that Michael O'Nan had independently proved the same result. The theorem states that a maximal subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(Ω), where Ω = n is one of the following: # Sk × Sn−k the stabilizer of a k-set (that is, intransitive) # Sa wr Sb with n = ab, the stabilizer of a partition into b parts of size a (that is, imprimitive) #primitive (that is, preserves no nontrivial partition) and of one of the following types: ::* AGL(d,p) ::*Sl wr Sk, the stabilizer of the product structure Ω = Δk ::*a group of diagonal type ::*an almost simple group In a survey paper written for the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, Peter J. Cameron seems to have been the first to recognize that the real power in the O'Nan–Scott theorem is in the ability to split the finite primitive groups into various types. In their paper, \\"On the O'Nan Scott Theorem for primitive permutation groups,\\" M.W. Liebeck, Cheryl Praeger and Jan Saxl give a complete self-contained proof of the theorem. O'Nan–Scott types The eight O'Nan–Scott types are as follows: HA (holomorph of an abelian group): These are the primitive groups which are subgroups of the affine general linear group AGL(d,p), for some prime p and positive integer d ≥ 1. For such a group G to be primitive, it must contain the subgroup of all translations, and the stabilizer G0 in G of the zero vector must be an irreducible subgroup of GL(d,p). Primitive groups of type HA are characterized by having a unique minimal normal subgroup which is elementary abelian and acts regularly. HS (holomorph of a simple group): Let T be a finite nonabelian simple group. Then M = T×T acts on Ω = T by t(t1,t2) = t1−1tt2. Now M has two minimal normal subgroups N1, N2, each isomorphic to T and each acts regularly on Ω, one by right multiplication and one by left multiplication. The action of M is primitive and if we take α = 1T we have Mα = {(t,t)t ∈ T}, which includes Inn(T) on Ω. In fact any automorphism of T will act on Ω. A primitive group of type HS is then any group G such that M ≅ T.Inn(T) ≤ G ≤ T.Aut(T). All such groups have N1 and N2 as minimal normal subgroups. HC (holomorph of a compound group): Let T be a nonabelian simple group and let N1 ≅ N2 ≅ Tk for some integer k ≥ 2. Let Ω = Tk. Then M = N1 × N2 acts transitively on Ω via x(n1,n2) = n1−1xn2 for all x ∈ Ω, n1 ∈ N1, n2 ∈ N2. As in the HS case, we have M ≅ Tk.Inn(Tk) and any automorphism of Tk also acts on Ω. A primitive group of type HC is a group G such that M ≤ G ≤ Tk.Aut(Tk)and G induces a subgroup of Aut(Tk) = Aut(T)wrSk which acts transitively on the set of k simple direct factors of Tk. Any such G has two minimal normal subgroups, each isomorphic to Tk and regular. A group of type HC preserves a product structure Ω = Δk where Δ = T and G≤ HwrSk where H is a primitive group of type HS on Δ. TW (twisted wreath): Here G has a unique minimal normal subgroup N and N ≅ Tk for some finite nonabelian simple group T and N acts regularly on Ω. Such groups can be constructed as twisted wreath products and hence the label TW. The conditions required to get primitivity imply that k≥ 6 so the smallest degree of such a primitive group is 606 . AS (almost simple): Here G is a group lying between T and Aut(T ), that is, G is an almost simple group and so the name. We are not told anything about what the action is, other than that it is primitive. Analysis of this type requires knowing about the possible primitive actions of almost simple groups, which is equivalent to knowing the maximal subgroups of almost simple groups. SD (simple diagonal): Let N = Tk for some nonabelian simple group T and integer k ≥ 2 and let H = {(t,...,t) t ∈ T} ≤ N. Then N acts on the set Ω of right cosets of H in N by right multiplication. We can take {(t1,...,tk−1, 1) ti ∈ T}to be a set of coset representatives for H in N and so we can identify Ω with Tk−1. Now (s1,...,sk) ∈ N takes the coset with representative (t1,...,tk−1, 1) to the coset H(t1s1,...,tk−1sk−1, sk) = H(sk−1tks1,...,sk−1tk−1sk−1, 1)The group Sk induces automorphisms of N by permuting the entries and fixes the subgroup H and so acts on the set Ω. Also, note that H acts on Ω by inducing Inn(T) and in fact any automorphism σ of T acts on Ω by taking the coset with representative (t1,...,tk−1, 1)to the coset with representative (t1σ,...,tk−1σ, 1). Thus we get a group W = N.(Out(T) × Sk) ≤ Sym(Ω). A primitive group of type SD is a group G ≤ W such that N ◅ G and G induces a primitive subgroup of Sk on the k simple direct factors of N. CD (compound diagonal): Here Ω = Δk and G ≤ HwrSk where H is a primitive group of type SD on Δ with minimal normal subgroup Tl. Moreover, N = Tkl is a minimal normal subgroup of G and G induces a transitive subgroup of Sk. PA (product action): Here Ω = Δk and G ≤ HwrSk where H is a primitive almost simple group on with socle T. Thus G has a product action on Ω. Moreover, N = Tk ◅ G and G induces a transitive subgroup of Sk in its action on the k simple direct factors of N. Some authors use different divisions of the types. The most common is to include types HS and SD together as a “diagonal type” and types HC, CD and PA together as a “product action type.\\" Praeger later generalized the O’Nan–Scott Theorem to quasiprimitive groups in her paper \\"An O'Nan–Scott Theorem for Finite Quasiprimitive Permutation Groups and an Application to 2-Arc Transitive Graphs\\".

It contains a single species, Batrachomimus pastosbonensis, with the specific name referring to the formation, which was first described and named by Felipe C. Montefeltro, Hans C. E. Larsson, Marco A. G. de França and Max C. Langer in 2013. It is known from a nearly complete skull, osteoderms and limb bones. Batrachomimus belongs to the family Paralligatoridae and predates all other members of the family and its immediate sister group, Eusuchia, by 30 million years. Description Batrachomimus is known from a single holotype skull known as LPRP/USP-0617, which preserves most of the skull and lower jaws except for the skull table, braincase, and the left temporal region. The skull is about , giving an estimated total body length of about . Batrachomimus has a narrow snout with wavy margins around the teeth. It is unique in having a smooth area of bone on the maxilla, near the back of the snout; most crocodyliforms have heavy pitting covering the entire upper surface of the skull, including all of the maxilla. Another unique feature or autapomorphy of Batrachomimus is the hourglass-shape of its choanae, which are two holes on the underside of the skull that are openings for the nasal passages. Other distinguishing features of Batrachomimus are its lack of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae (holes in front of the eyes and at the back of the lower jaw, respectively), and a backward extension of the premaxilla bone on the snout to the level of the fifth tooth of the maxilla bone behind it. Etymology The genus name \\"Batrachomimus\\" means \\"batrachian mimic\\" in Greek, a reference to the holotype specimen originally being identified as that of a temnospondyl, a type of prehistoric amphibian that vaguely resembles modern batrachians (frogs and toads). In addition to being considered a temnospondyl, the holotype was thought to have come from the Pedra de Fogo Formation, which dates back to the Permian, a time when temnospondyls were the dominant form of large semi-aquatic animals. The genus name also alludes to crocodyliforms replacing temnospondyls as semi-aquatic predators during the Jurassic. Phylogeny The phylogenetic analysis of Montefeltro et al. (2013) placed Batrachomimus as the most basal member of the group Paralligatoridae, which also includes the genera Shamosuchus and Rugosuchus from the Cretaceous of Asia.

Though involved in journalism, he planned to run as mayor of Colipa, Veracruz in 2010 under the National Action Party (PAN). He was known for his direct reporting style, and particularly for writing articles about organized crime, drug trafficking, political corruption, and government inaction. On 19 April 2010, Evaristo sent a text message to his sister saying that he had been forced into a police car in Colipa. He has been missing ever since. Career Evaristo Ortega Zárate was born in the municipality of Colipa, Veracruz, Mexico in a small community of roughly 300 people known as Cerro del Tigre. He studied at the Universidad Pedagógica Veracruzana. In 2004, he and his friend Ángel Cruz started a newspaper, Espacio, in Misantla, Veracruz. About a year and a half later, Cruz died of stomach cancer but Evaristo continued to work in the newspaper they had created. By 2009, Espacio's popularity grew at a regional level and began to circulate in the capital city of Xalapa. His newspaper experienced various ups and downs because the printing costs for the publications were carried out at the Diario AZ newspaper and were paid straight from Evaristo's pocket. However, his investigative journalism, like his reports on corruption, politics, and societal issues, made Espacio popular among local readers and journalists. He also published articles about drug trafficking and organized crime, and criticized and investigated local politicians for their inactions. His direct reporting angered politicians and public functionaries because they were often the main subject of Evaristo's reports. He then tried to get his newspaper to circulate at a state level, but his project ultimately failed and he decided to concentrate in the area of Misantla. In Misantla, he also worked for the newspaper Diario Misantla, which he founded in 2007. Though involved in journalism, he also expressed a desire to run as mayor of Colipa under the National Action Party (PAN) in 2010. He worked for the PAN in the campaigns of Irma Chedraui and Alba Leonila Méndez, who were running for Mexico's Chamber of Deputies. Disappearance Evaristo was last seen by his colleagues at the headquarters of the PAN and having breakfast at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Colipa on 19 April 2010. Around noon that day, his sister Margarita received a text message from him saying that he had been taken into custody in a police car. \\"Alert everyone ... They've arrested us ... They have made us get into a police car,\\" the text read. On 22 April 2010, the Veracruz state authorities ruled out the possibility that Evaristo was kidnapped by policeman under the rationale that he was not a well known journalist or public figure. They alleged that such an act of repression would only be reasonable if Evaristo was a \\"very important figure,\\" and the authorities think that was not the case. However, press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders questions this decision and believes that Evaristo's disappearance may be linked to his political career, his profession as a journalist, or both.

July 13, 1946 - d. January 29, 2014) was an entrepreneur from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. He was born July 13, 1946 and raised in Zacatecas until 1961, when he left the state to attend high school at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Monterrey in 1961. He continued at the school for university, graduating in 1970 with a degree in business administration, with the aim of returning to his home state to be an entrepreneur. He chose to study at the Tec because of its educational model and the respect held in Zacatecas for the industry in Monterrey. One of his aims in high school was to meet the Tec founder Eugenio Garza Sada which he was able to do. In the very early 1980s, Guillermo Jones Pereda, Juan De Santiago Ortega and Reimers founded Cerámica Santo Niño, today known as Cesantoni. The business began by making ceramic tiles but has since branched out into other ceramic products. The traditional means of making tile in Mexico requires two firings, but he decided to work to find a way to create the product in one firing, succeeding by the end of the 1980s. In 1998, the company worked to automate the process as much as possible, which included replacing many of the existing facilities. Much of the work is now done by robots. The plant works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is an important source of employment in the state, not only in the plants but also through its demand for raw materials from mines in the state of Zacatecas. He has been quoted as saying that making more money is not the purpose of life, but rather go beyond what already exists. In 1985, Reimers was approached by his alma mater to organize and find resources to found a campus of Tec de Monterrey in Zacatecas. A short time later, he became an advisor to the new institution.

Civilian life Moldagulova was born on October 25, 1925, in Bulak, Kazakhstan. She lost her parents during her childhood and was living with her uncle in Alma-Ata. By 1935 she moved to Leningrad where her uncle was enrolled into a Military- transport academy. In fall of 1939, at the age of 14, she was sent to the orphanage from which she was evacuated when the war began in 1942 via Ladoga Lake. After graduating from Vyatka secondary school she received a scholarship to Rybinsk Aviatechnical School on October 1.  Military career  After studying at the Rybinsk Aviatechnical School for three months, she applied for a waiver to join the Red Army. In May 1943, she was enrolled in the Central Women’s Sniper Training School. In July of that same year, after graduating and swearing the military oath, she was deployed with the 54th Rifle Brigade along with her friends from the center where they trained. In January 1944 her brigade ambushed Germans at the Novosokolniki—Dno railway. Later on, she realized that her commander was missing, and assumed command. After assuming command of her brigade, she inspired her comrades by shouting \\"Brothers, soldiers, follow me!\\", and the battalion pressed the attack by overrunning the Wehrmacht position. On 14 January 1944, during hand-to-hand combat, Moldagulova was hit by a mortar shell and slightly wounded. Despite the wound, she fought off the enemy combatants until she was mortally wounded and no longer able to fight. Moldagulova died from a gunshot wound later that day after writing a letter to her sister. On 4 June 1944, Moldagulova was awarded (posthumously) the title Hero of the Soviet Union and an Order of Lenin, respectively. Moldagulova was buried in a mass grave in Monakovo, Pskov.

Often, temples, elite residences, and council buildings stood atop substructure or townhouse mounds such as Ely Mound.(Decaying cedar posts remained in the ground in the late 1800s, and were frequently struck by plows). Lucien Carr, assistant curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Boston, led an excavation here in 1877.

Lê Uy Mục was portrayed in Đại Việt's historical annals as an arrogant and ruthless monarch. His reign oversaw the beginning of the decline of the Đại Việt empire, having been prosperous and powerful during the able reigns of Lê Thánh Tông, Lê Hiến Tông and Lê Túc Tông. Annalists during the Revival Lê dynasty recorded him as having killed many people including his grandmother and two of his ministers, as well as many imperial princes. He also wasted his energy in excessive drinking and sexual activities. It was alleged that some Ming ambassadors, having examined the emperor Lê Uy Mục's aggressive physical appearance, labelled him as Demon King (Quỷ vương, 鬼王). In 1504, Uy Mục arrested his cousin Lê Oanh, son of Hiến Tông's younger brother Lê Tân. Oanh eventually escaped southwards to Thanh Hóa, the homeland of the imperial house. Here, Oanh organized a rebellion against the government.

Lê Oanh was enthroned as Emperor Lê Tương Dực, who later turned to be another unpopular monarch.  Biography  = Childhood = The only primary source about Lê Uy Mục's life was contained in the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, the official historical chronicle of Đại Việt during the Lê dynasty. The chronicle was first compiled in 1479 by Ngô Sĩ Liên, a chronicler in the court of Lê Thánh Tông, Uy Mục's grandfather. After 1479, the works were continually supplemented by other Đại Việt's chroniclers. Parts including details about Lê Uy Mục was added by the minister Vũ Quỳnh in 1511. According to the chronicle, Uy Mục's real name was Lê Tuấn (黎濬). He was born on 5 May 1488 during the reign of his grandfather Lê Thánh Tông. He was the second son of Crown Prince Lê Tranh and Lady Nguyễn Thị Cận. His mother was originally a maid of Consort Nguyễn Kính Phi. She died after giving birth to him and he was adopted by Consort Nguyễn Kính Phi. Because his mother was a maid, during his childhood he was always be looked down on by his grandmother, Empress Trường Lạc. In 1496, Emperor Lê Thánh Tông died, probably being poisoned by Empress Trường Lạc. Lê Tuấn's father Lê Tranh ascended to the throne, known to chroniclers as Emperor Lê Hiến Tông. In early 1499, several government ministers including Lê Vĩnh and Lê Năng Nhượng persuaded Hiến Tông to choose an heir in order to maintain the dynasty's and the nation's security and sustainability. Hiến Tông agreed, but he despised his two eldest sons, Lê Tuân and Lê Tuấn, for being intellectually and morally unsuited for the throne. The emperor eventually designed his third son, Lê Thuần (mothered by Consort Nguyễn Hoàn) as Crown Prince. In 1504, Emperor Lê Hiến Tông died at the age of 44. Crown Prince Lê Thuần was enthroned as Emperor Lê Túc Tông. Having reigned for only six months, Túc Tông felt critically ill in December 1504. Realising that he could not pass the disease, Túc Tông designated his elder brother Lê Tuấn as his successor. On 12 January 1505, Túc Tông died at the age of 17. Lê Tuấn's grandmother, who had become Grand Empress Dowager Trường Lạc since the death of Hiến Tông, despised Tuấn's origin as son of a maid. She preferred another prince in royal family. With the help from Nguyễn Kính Phi and Nguyễn Nhữ Vy, finally he could become the next emperor of Lê dynasty, Emperor Lê Uy Mục, in 1505. = Reign = Lê Uy Mục was portrayed by Neo-Confucianist chroniclers as being deeply contrasted to his predecessors Lê Thánh Tông, Lê Hiến Tông and Lê Túc Tông, who closely followed Neo- Confucianist principles in governing the nation. In 1505, Uy Mục ordered his servants to assassinate his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Trường Lạc. The Grand Empress Dowager was killed at the age of 65. Also, he launched a bloody purge to kill all of the officials serving in the royal court who did not support him to become the emperor, such as Đàm Văn Lễ, Nguyễn Quang Bật and also one of the supported official Nguyễn Nhữ Vy. He investigated all of the princes in the royal family and killed anyone who was considered as dangers for his position. He also ordered to massacre the Cham people who served as slaves for government officials. He spent almost every night in the palace drinking with beauties, and whenever he got drunk, he killed these ladies. The power fell into consort kin. People from Nguyễn clan of Nguyễn Kính Phi, Nguyễn clan of Lady Nguyễn Thị Cận and Trần clan of Empress Trần Thị Tùng were saucy but had a lot of power. They made much corruption, riffled poverty of people and also killed a lot of people including court officials and normal people. During his era, many people became afraid of his despotic rule. = Dethronement = Prince Lê Oanh, after escaping from the bloody purge, together with a group of officials - notably Nguyễn Văn Lang plotted again the despotic ruler. They launched a coup since November 1509. Emperor Lê Uy Mục knew that, he killed Lê Oanh's parents but still lost in the coup. The Emperor was deposed and requested to suicide. He died on December 1, 1509, and was buried at the tomb of An lăng. Prince Lê Oanh became the successor, Emperor Lê Tương Dực.

The only primary account of his life and reign was the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, the official historical chronicle of Đại Việt during the Lê dynasty which was completed in 1697 under the direction of Trịnh lords. The chronicle described Lê Tương Dực as initially being a good emperor who reorganized the court and used laws wisely; however, later during his reign, he spent extravagantly on leisure activities and that weakened nation seriously. He was a grandson of Lê Thánh Tông and a second son of prince Lê Tân, a younger brother of Lê Hiến Tông. His mother was Trịnh Thị Tuyên, a daughter of general Trịnh Trọng Phong. In 1509, Hiến Tông's son, Emperor Lê Uy Mục arrested Lê Oanh during a program of purging imperial princes who were suspicious of disloyalty. Oanh fled to Thanh Hoá, the House of Lê's homeland, and gathered an army against the Emperor. With the help of his lieutenants Nguyễn Văn Lang and Nguyễn Hoằng Dụ, Oanh marched his army to the imperial capital and defeated the Emperor's military officers. In retaliation, Lê Uy Mục executed Oanh's elder brother, Lê Sùng. That did not prevent Oanh from decisively routing the Emperor's main army and killing Uy Mục. Oanh then styled himself as Emperor and designed his era name as Hồng Thuận (洪順). In the early years of his reign, Lê Oanh, known to later generations as Lê Tương Dực, had some achievements in reorganizing the government and fostering Neo- Confucianist education. He also ordered the compilation of a new historical chronicle, Đại Việt thông giám thông khảo, by the Minister of War Vũ Quỳnh, and Trị bình bảo phạm, or Rules for Maintaining Social Stability in accordance with Neo-Confucianism. However, later in his reign, he spent extravagantly in building many colossal palaces in the imperial capital, Thăng Long. The most notable of those places was one known to the Vietnamese as Cửu Trùng Đài, designed by the emperor's favoured architect Vũ Như Tô. He also spent much time enjoying sexual activities with his concubines, many of whom were former concubines of Lê Hiến Tông and Lê Uy Mục. According to court chroniclers, he ordered the build of special boats for his nude concubines to row on large artificial lakes. As the result of the emperor's luxurious lifestyle and ignorance of state affairs, the people suffered considerable hardships. Many soldiers committed to build imperial palaces died due to diseases. As the government became increasingly unpopular, many rebellions broke out. The largest of them was that of Trần Cảo, a northerner who claimed to be an heir of the House of Trần.

Biography  According to the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, the official historical annal of Đại Việt that came into its final form in 1697 during the Revival Lê dynasty, Lê Túc Tông's real name was Lê Thuần (黎㵮). He was born on 6 September 1488 in the imperial capital Đông Kinh, being the third son of crown prince Lê Tranh, the eldest son of emperor Lê Thánh Tông. Thuần's mother was Nguyễn Hoàn, a concubine of Tranh coming from Hưng Yên. In 1497, when Lê Thuần was 8 years old, his grandfather Lê Thánh Tông died and his father Lê Tranh ascended to the throne. The new emperor was known to historical annals as Lê Hiến Tông. In early 1499, several high-ranking officials including Lê Vĩnh and Lê Năng Nhượng persuaded Hiến Tông to choose an heir in order to maintain the dynasty's and the nation's security and sustainability. Hiến Tông agreed; and although the emperor had two elder sons: Lê Tuân and Lê Tuấn, Lê Thuần was designed as crown prince due to his deep interest in intellectuality and Neo- Confucianism, which caused Hiến Tông to perceive him as being far superior to his two older brothers. In 1504, Lê Hiến Tông died at the age of 44. The 17 year old Lê Thuần inherited the throne. The Confucian annalists portrayed him as a relatively good emperor who released many prisoners, stopping several construction works that posed heavy burden on his subjects, as well as reducing tributes from vassals and holding high-ranking officials in high regard. He was also said to have maintained harmony in the court and the whole country. In the other hand, the annals also recorded a revolt broke in Cao Bằng, led by Đoàn Thế Nùng against the government. Lê Thuần sent troops to Cao Bằng, defeating and killing Đoàn Thế Nùng along with 500 rebels. The reign of Lê Thuần lasted for only six months. In December 1502, immediately after completing the burial process for his father, he felt critically ill. Understanding that he could not pass the disease, Lê Thuần designated his second elder brother, Lê Tuấn, as the apparent heir. Not late after that, the emperor died and Lê Tuấn succeeded him as the 8th emperor of the Lê dynasty. The new emperor and court officials designed the deceased emperor's temple name as Túc Tông. Lê Túc Tông's death could be seen as the beginning of the decline of the Lê dynasty, as Lê Tuấn soon proved to be a cruel and extravagant monarch who killed many imperial members and employed corrupt officials. When Túc Tông came to the throne, he declared that in the next year (1505), the era name will be changed from his father's old one, Cảnh Thống (景統) to Thái Trinh (泰貞). However, Túc Tông died before 1504 was over; so, throughout his short reign, he still used the era name Cảnh Thống and the name Thái Trinh was never put into use. His successor, Lê Tuấn changed the era name to Đoan Khánh.

He was portrayed by Stephen Schnetzer from 1982 to 1999. Schnetzer also appeared as Cass on As the World Turns from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2005 to 2006 and on Guiding Light in 2002. Storylines Cass Cadwallader Winthrop came to town as a scheming but good-natured casanova - a skilled attorney who kept looking for shortcuts to success. He was a former lover of Felicia Gallant and the two resumed their complicated romance, though Cass also had eyes for Sally Frame. Cass and Felicia later became best friends and always stood by each other throughout the years. Cass had a tumultuous relationship with Cecile DePoulignac, which ended with her marriage to a foreign prince, though Cass had a hard time accepting it, triggering many comic complications. Cass formed a partnership with aspiring reporter Kathleen McKinnon, leading to several years of romantic sparring, criminal investigations, dangerous adventures, and the first real love of his life. Cecile, now a widow, tried to get Cass back, kidnapping him and making Kathleen believe Cass had chosen her, but Cass escaped and won her back. At one point, Kathleen was paralyzed by Carl Hutchins and tried to withdraw from the world, but Cass nursed her back to health. The two finally married, and left Bay City. Some months later, Kathleen was seemingly killed in a plane crash. Cass went into an emotional tailspin that only his and Kathleen's close friend Wallingford was able to bring him out of, telling him that Kathleen had been the best part of him. Cass never thought he would fall for anyone again until he got involved with Nicole Love. With his wedding day to Nicole fast approaching, Cass crossed paths with eccentric detective, Frankie Frame. Frankie proved Nicole had murdered her uncle, Jason Frame, and she was institutionalized. At first, Cass and Frankie did not like each other (similar to his early relationship with Kathleen), however they came to find they had a lot in common. They fell madly in love. A few months after they married, Cass discovered Kathleen was alive—she had concealed this to save Cass's life from shadowy criminal forces led by Carl Hutchins. His marriage to Frankie was now invalid and he had to choose between his two wives. Still in the grip of his passion for Kathleen, and knowing she needed him more because of the danger she was in, Cass chose her over Frankie. Frankie discovered she was pregnant shortly after splitting with Cass, but chose not to tell him. She later miscarried the baby. Cass ultimately chose Frankie, and Kathleen left town (a decision by the writers triggered in part by Julie Osburn, who played Kathleen, once more leaving the show in spite of being asked to stay).http://www.anotherworldhomepage.com/chat56.html They grew closer, but upon finding out about Frankie's miscarriage, the pair hit another rough patch. Cass realized why Frankie had lied to him and forgave her, but Frankie was still reluctant to reunite with him because of his previous abandonment (though she had known for a long time that he was still in love with Kathleen). They eventually managed to reunite and legally marry in a ceremony in Venice surrounded by their loved ones. They honeymooned on the Orient Express. Not long after the wedding, Frankie found out she was pregnant again. She gave birth their to their beloved daughter Charlotte, nicknamed Charlie. When Charlie was a few months old, it was discovered she had a genetic heart condition. Cass blamed himself for Charlie's illness and the stress triggered his bipolar disorder. Cass refused to accept he was ill, but with the love and support of Frankie and his brother, Morgan, eventually sought treatment. Frankie was tragically murdered by the Bay City Stalker. Cass tried to move on and be a good father to Charlie. He began a flirtation with Lila Roberts, but she was with Matthew Cory. Once they split up, the two began a relationship. Cass and Lila married on the last episode of Another World (their union seemingly blessed by Frankie's ghost). In the end, Cass finally realized that his deepest and most lasting feelings were not for any of his many lovers, but for his daughter. Bay City's ultimate playboy had finally grown up. In late 1999 (after the cancellation of Another World), Cass began appearing on As the World Turns, initially defending Margo Hughes against charges that she'd murdered Alec Wallace. After Margo was acquitted in early 2000, Cass remained on As the World Turns, frequently interacting with Jake McKinnon (who'd also crossed over to ATWT after Another World ended), and collaborating with his legal colleagues Tom Hughes and Jessica Griffin. The character remained on ATWT through 2002.

Every knotted curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a quadrisecant. The number of quadrisecants of an algebraic curve in complex projective space can be computed by a formula derived by Arthur Cayley. Quadrisecants of skew lines are also associated with ruled surfaces and the Schläfli double six configuration. In knot theory In three-dimensional Euclidean space, every non-trivial tame knot or link has a quadrisecant. Originally established in the case of knotted polygons and smooth knots by Erika Pannwitz, this result was extended to knots in suitably general position and links with nonzero linking number, and later to all nontrivial tame knots and links. Pannwitz proved more strongly that the number of distinct quadrisecants is lower bounded by a function of the minimum number of boundary singularities in a locally-flat open disk bounded by the knot. conjectured that the number of distinct quadrisecants of a given knot is always at least n(n − 1)/2, where n is the crossing number of the knot. However, counterexamples to this conjecture have since been discovered. Two-component links have quadrisecants in which the points on the quadrisecant appear in alternating order between the two components, and nontrivial knots have quadrisecants in which the four points, ordered cyclically as a,b,c,d on the knot, appear in order a,c,b,d along the quadrisecant. The existence of these alternating quadrisecants can be used to derive the Fary–Milnor theorem, a lower bound on the total curvature of a nontrivial knot. Quadrisecants have also been used to find lower bounds on the ropelength of knots. In algebraic geometry Arthur Cayley derived a formula for the number of quadrisecants of an algebraic curve in three-dimensional complex projective space, as a function of its degree and genus. For a curve of degree d and genus g, the number of quadrisecants is :\\\\frac{(d-2)(d-3)^2(d-4)}{12}-\\\\frac{g(d^2-7d+13-g)}{2}. Of skew lines The Schläfli double six In three-dimensional Euclidean space, every set of four skew lines in general position either has two quadrisecants (also called in this context transversals) or none. Any three of the four lines determine a doubly ruled surface, in which one of the two sets of ruled lines contains the three given lines, and the other ruling consists of trisecants to the given lines. If the fourth of the given lines pierces this surface, its two points of intersection lie on the two quadrisecants; if it is disjoint from the surface, then there are no quadrisecants. The quadrisecants of sets of lines play an important role in the construction of the Schläfli double six, a configuration of twelve lines intersecting each other in 30 crossings. If five lines are given in a three-dimensional space, such that all five are intersected by a common line b6 but are otherwise in general position, then each of the five quadruples of the lines ai has a second quadrisecant bi, and the five lines bi formed in this way are all intersected by a common line a6. These twelve lines and the 30 intersection points aibj form the double six.

It was unveiled in London's Trafalgar Square on 25 July 2013 and was displayed on the vacant fourth plinth. The fibreglass work stood high and was the sixth work to be displayed on the plinth, on which it stayed until 17 February 2015. It was subsequently acquired by Glenstone, a private museum, and exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, following its 2016 reopening. The work is in an edition of two. The second version is in the sculpture garden of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, MN on a pedestal designed by the artist. Meanings Fritsch says that there are many possible interpretations of the cockerel, which took her two and a half years to create, but calls it \\"a feminist sculpture, since it is I who am doing something active here – I, a woman, am depicting something male. Historically it has always been the other way around. Now we are changing the roles. And a lot of men are enjoying that.\\" She notes that the surrounding area has a strongly male character, with numerous statues of \\"male persons standing on pedestals\\" and the male-dominated culture that goes with London's status as a business centre. The statue is intended to be a humorous counterbalance, contrasting with the very formal equestrian statues on the square's other three plinths: \\"Humour is always a big thing for me. It stops things from becoming too severe. I like English humour. It is so often very dark.\\" The sculpture was selected by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, a panel of specialist advisors that guides and monitors the commissions for the plinth. According to a press release issued by the group to announce Fritsch as the winner of the commission, It was unveiled on 25 July 2013 by Mayor of London Boris Johnson. He pointed out the irony that the cockerel, an unofficial national emblem of France, was standing in a square commemorating a famous British victory over the French. Fritsch has said that she was unaware of the connection until it was explained to her. According to Fritsch, she chose the cockerel to represent strength and regeneration, \\"but it's a nice humorous side-effect to have something French in a place that celebrates victory over Napoleon. He has come back as a cockerel!\\" Johnson said in his speech that \\"I hope French people will not take it as excessive British chauvinism – but for me it stands for the recent British triumph in the Tour de France, which we have won twice in a row ... it is a symbol of French sporting pride, brought like a chicken to London. We have mounted this French cock at the heart of our imperial square.\\" Fritsch and Johnson have both noted the sexual double entendre in the work's name – hahn in German has the same double meaning as \\"cock\\" in English – and the artist admits that it is consciously intended as a play on words. She highlighted the fact that Trafalgar Square itself has a somewhat phallic character: \\"It's about male posing, about showing power, about showing ... erections! I mean, look at that column!\\" Asked whether he felt that the cock had crushed his manhood, Johnson said: \\"No, not at all. I am happy to channel the power and enthusiasm of that bird; I feel inspired by its regal manner and mood of confidence.\\" He told the crowd that he would \\"not lapse into double entendres and ask how long this wonderful creature will 'stay up' in the square,\\" before unveiling what he called a \\"big, blue ... bird.\\" Reception The giant cock received generally positive reviews from art critics, with punning headlines such as \\"Big blue cock erected on fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square\\", \\"Boris Johnson in Trafalgar Square with a Massive Blue Cock And Disgruntled Woman\\" and \\"Boris Johnson unveils giant cock in Trafalgar Square\\"). Adrian Searle of The Guardian commented that \\"the scale and modelling and degree of detail feel right\\", with a \\"lifelike and other-worldly\\" feel to the sculpture. He felt that it avoided \\"straining to look meaningful or relevant\\" and that despite its irreverence, it \\"lightens the mood and lifts the spirit.\\" The Daily Telegraph's Serena Davis did not regard it as being as impressive as some of the previous works to have stood on the fourth plinth, but nonetheless called it \\"one of the jolliest things to have sat upon the square's spare plinth since the public art commissions for it began in 2005.\\" BBC News' arts correspondent Rebecca Jones wrote that the work has \\"a kind of joyful aspect to it which will put a smile on many people's faces\\". Visitors interviewed by the London Evening Standard newspaper also gave it a thumbs up. The Thorney Island Society, a local conservation group, objected to the sculpture on the grounds that it was \\"unrelated to the context of Trafalgar Square and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction\\", but The Guardian's chief arts writer Charlotte Higgins pointed out that Fritsch's other works have a habit of \\"appear[ing] \\"fanciful and dramatic\\" and \\"unrelated\\" to their contexts.\\" She commented that one should not \\"overthink it. It's a big, blue, funny, weird, surreal bird in Trafalgar Square. It's going to cheer us all up.

Using the techniques she had studied, Norell managed to revive the child using cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which continued for more than an hour. The child made a complete recovery. In 1782, Governor Anders de Bruce awarded her the medal of the Patriotiska Sällskapet (Prize of the Patriotic Society) and, a monetary prize followed two years later in 1783. This Prize made Ingeborg Norell the first woman to receive official recognition in Finland.  Personal Life  Norell was likely the daughter of the saddle maker Hans Stenborg. In 1764, she married the jeweler Carl Gustaf Norell, formerly Norelius (1738-1782) who was the apprentice to Ingeborg's brother, goldsmith Jacob Stenborg. Ingeborg's husband was eleven years younger than she was, but he died at the age of 46 in December 1782. Of the three children born into the family, the only surviving son was Jacob Johan. Her later life remains unknown.

The company was founded in 2005 by filmmakers Alexander Carson, Nicholas Martin, and Kyle Thomas, who met at the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec. North Country Cinema produces and distributes director-driven film and video content, and has created award-winning works that have screened at major international festivals, including the Toronto International Film Festival and SXSW. In 2011, Carson and Thomas completed \\"We Refuse To Be Cold\\" and Not Far From The Abattoir, respectively. These films combined to screen at over twenty-five international festivals and were both acquired by CBC Television for broadcast in 2012 and 2013. Both films focus on intimate narratives and personal storytelling, drawing from the experimental European New Wave cinemas of the 1960s and the gritty, character-driven American Cinema of the 1970s. In 2011, Calgary-based filmmaker Cameron Macgowan joined North Country Cinema following a collaboration with Thomas as producing partners on Not Far From The Abattoir. Although Nicholas Martin still collaborates with Carson and Thomas in various capacities, he is no longer a producing partner. In 2013, North Country Cinema began production on Thomas' feature film The Valley Below, a multi-narrative drama set in the badlands of central Alberta. Following the announcement that the film would be funded through their inaugural Micro- Budget Production Program, Telefilm Canada named Kyle Thomas one of \\"10 Canadians to Watch at Cannes\\" in 2013. The Valley Below, originally titled Down In The Valley, was renamed to address \\"practical and creative concerns regarding the public representation of the film going forward\\" on August 15, 2013. In 2014, Alexander Carson received the Golden Gate Award for New Visions at the San Francisco International Film Festival for his short film Numbers & Friends. In July 2014, North Country Cinema announced the production of its second feature film, O, Brazen Age, by writer/director Alexander Carson, produced with the support of Telefilm Canada and the Canada Council for the Arts. In August, 2014, the Toronto International Film Festival announced its Canadian program, including the World Premiere of The Valley Below as part of official selection in the Discovery program at the 2014 festival. During the festival, The Valley Below was acquired for Canadian distribution by A71 Entertainment. Opening theatrically across Canada in March 2015, The Valley Below garnered considerable critical attention, including positive reviews from both Canadian national newspapers: The National Post and The Globe and Mail. The film garnered two Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 3rd Canadian Screen Awards, in the categories of Best Supporting Actor for Kris Demeanor and Best Original Song for Dan Mangan's song \\"Wants\\".\\"Canadian Screen Awards Unveil Nominations\\". The Hollywood Reporter, January 13, 2015. In September, 2015, the Vancouver International Film Festival announced that O, Brazen Age, Alexander Carson's feature-length debut, would have its World Premiere at the festival as part of the Canadian Images program. The film went on to screen at numerous film festivals throughout 2016 and earned positive reviews from NOW Magazine and The Globe and Mail when it was released theatrically in Canada in 2017. O, Brazen Age was also heralded as a success by Canadian filmmakers Atom Egoyan and Guy Maddin.

The building complex was inaugurated in 1945 to a Functionalist design by Vilhelm Lauritzen and later expanded in 1958 and 1972. Vacated by DR when DR Byen was inaugurated in 2006, the buildings now house the Royal Danish Academy of Music as well as the Museum of Music once it reopens. The complex also contains a concert hall. The building was listed in 1994. History Franz Šedivý: The New Radio House, 1930s Franz Šedivý: The Radio House, 1940 During the first years of its existence, Danish Broadcasting Corporation (Danish Statsradiofonien) was based at various locations in Copenhagen, including in Stærekassen on Kongens Nytorv and in Axelborg on Vesterbrogade. As the organization grew, the need for a larger, purpose-built home became evident. Vilhelm Lauritzen was one of four members of a building committee which in the summer of 1934 went on a study trip to London, Paris, Brussels, Geneva, Zürich, Prague, Leipzig, Berlin and Konigsberg, visiting similar broadcasting houses, and later that year Lauritzen published a preliminary design proposal broadcasting house in Arkitekten. The building went under construction in 1938 and was mostly ready in January 1941, although the concert hall was not completed until 1945. The complex was expanded with a new wing for DR's Television operations. In 1964, as they required still more space, they moved to the new TV-Byen complex in Gladsaxe, leaving only the radio broadcasting activities and corporate management in Radiohuset which saw another expansion in 1972. Television news, under the TV Avisen banner, remained at Radiohuset before it moved to TV-Byen in October 1983. In 2001, Radiohuset was sold to the Royal Danish Academy of Music which let it to DR until DR-byen was completed in 2006. Architecture The original complex consisted of four elements: A main wing, also known as Høj Fløj (literally \\"High Wing\\") with the main entrance on Rosenørns Allé, a lower wing on its right-hand side (Lav Fløj, literally \\"Low Wing\\"), Studieblokken (literally \\"The Studio Block\\") to its rear and the trapezoid concert hall on Julius Thonsens Gade. The extension in 1958 added a new wing (Ny Fløj, literally \\"New Wing\\") to the rear of the main wing, on Worsaaesvej, and the 1972 expansion integrated a former residential building on Worsaaesvej in the complex and added an extra floor on . Lauritzen collaborated with Finn Juhl on furniture, lamps and other fittings and Gudmund Nyeland Brandt designed the roof garden on the Studio Block. Royal Danish Music Academy An architectural competition for the adaption of the building for use by the Royal Danish Academy of Music was won by Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects, The Royal Music Academy inaugurated their new home on 1 September 2008. Concert hall The concert hall seats 1200 people. It contains a pipe organ with 84 voices and 114 ranks, built by Marcussen in 1946.

As a vassal ruler, he not only contributed manpower to the high king's nonstop military campaigns every year between 1541 and 1549 but also led armies in those campaigns.

He was asked to go along on the trip by Bayinnaung, who was concerned about the safety of the king. As Bayinnaung suspected, one of the king's closest advisers, the governor of Sittaung Smim Sawhtut, was planning to assassinate the king. Lagun Ein's constant presence foiled Sawhtut's plans for over two months but Sawhtut finally convinced the king to send Lagun Ein back to Martaban. Lagun Ein protested but had to obey the order. Soon after he left, the king was assassinated by Sawhtut's men.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 240–242 After Tabinshwehti's death, the kingdom he had built up in the last 15 years promptly fell apart.

Kiln sites  Location of the kamuiyaki kiln sites (center). Kamuiyaki ware were excavated from various sites in Amami, Okinawa and Yaeyama. However, it remained a mystery for a long time where they were produced. Prior to the discovery of kiln sites, kamuiyaki were known as or sue-like ware. The first kiln site was discovered by two local researchers, Yotsumoto Nobuhiro and Gi Norikazu, in 1983. It was located around a pond (, ) in Isen Town of Tokunoshima, after which kamuiyaki was named. The English spelling \\"kamuiyaki\\" is a transliteration of katakana \\".\\" The sequence \\"ui\\" does not represent a diphthong but a short central vowel /ï/ of the local dialects. Thus the spelling kamïyaki would be more accurate. The word kamï regularly corresponds to Standard Japanese although its homonym is assigned to the place name. Subsequent investigations found more than 100 kilns. They are clustered into seven groups, namely Asan-Kamuiyaki, Asan-Yanagida (South), Asan-Yanagida (North), Isen-Higashiyanagida, Isen-Hirasuko, Kenpuku-Iyagawa and Kenpuku- Utta. In 2007, they were designated as a national historic site. Archaeologist Takanashi Osamu argues that Tokunoshima was suitable for pottery because it was a \\"high\\" island as contrasted with \\"low\\", raised limestone islands such as Kikai, Okinoerabu and Yoron Islands. It had abundant forest resources that enabled pottery firing. Unlike Amami Ōshima, another high island, it also had plains for cultivation, making it possible to feed potters.  Distribution  A report by archaeologist Ikeda Yoshifumi in 2003 lists about 350 archaeological sites with kamuiyaki. They stretch from the Satsuma Peninsula of southern Kyūshū to Yonaguni Island of the Yaeyama Islands. In southern Kyūshū, kamuiyaki were excavated from sites near the month of the Manose River, Minamisatsuma, Kagoshima Prefecture. The Mottaimatsu Site, which was at its peak from the middle 12th century to the first half of the 13th century, had a huge variety of goods including kamuiyaki, a large number of Chinese ceramics such as Longquan celadon and Tong'an celadon, and in smaller quantity, sue wares from eastern Harima Province and Tokoname-yaki from Owari Province. Kamuiyaki were also found at the neighboring Wataribata and Shibahara Sites, and at the Kozono Site in the interior. Archaeologist Miyashita Takahiro argued that the Manose River basin had served as a trade center connected to Hakata–Dazaifu of northern Kyūshū. The presence of kamuiyaki suggests that this region was involved in the trade with the Southern Islands although excavated wares were slightly newer (around the 13th century) than archaeologists expected them to be. In the Amami Islands, in which the kiln sites are located, the emergence of kamuiyaki led to the disappearance of native Kaneku-type earthenwares in the first half of the 11th century. Only a small number of earthenwares continued to be produced and they imitated soapstone cauldrons. The common vessel forms of kamuiyaki include urns (kame), small mouthed, short necked jars (tsubo), wide mouth jars (hachi), grating bowls (suribachi) and bowls (wan). What distinguishes the Amami Islands from other island groups was the presence of the Gusuku Site Complex in Kikai Island. This archaeological site complex lasted for a long time from the 9th century. In its second peak, from the latter half of the 11th century to the first half of the 12th century, an exceptionally large quantities of sue wares, haji wares, kamuiyaki, and soapstone cauldrons produced in the Nishisonogi Peninsula, Nagasaki Prefecture were used together with Chinese white glazed wares, Chinese celadons, Goryeo ceramics and Goryeo unglazed stonewares. The Gusuku Site Complex is noted for its non-native nature and resemblance to Dazaifu, the administrative center of Kyūshū. It is highly probable that the Gusuku Site Complex was constructed by people under the State of Japan although Amami was not formally incorporated into the administrative system of Japan. Kamuiyaki found in the Okinawa Islands are characterized by their association with white glazed wares, soapstone cauldrons and locally produced earthenwares. These earthenwares, collectively called gusuku wares, were urns, small mouthed jars, wide mouth jars, bowls and dishes. They were considered to be imitations of exotic goods including Amami's kamuiyaki. According to archaeologist Takanashi Osamu, insufficient supply of exotic goods accounts for the production of gusuku wares. Okinawan archaeologists generally argue that gusuku wares replaced earlier flat bottomed pottery. Ikeda Yoshifumi raised doubts and suspected that flat bottomed pottery and gusuku wares had co-existed in the 11th to 12th centuries. In his hypothesis, gusuku wares represented an external power that took time to assimilate indigenous societies that produced flat bottomed pottery. The southern island groups of Miyako and Yaeyama are known for their peculiar archaeological development: a pottery culture was followed by a potteryless culture and then by another pottery culture. Kamuiyaki, together with white glazed wares, soapstone cauldrons and brown glazed wares, were found at the Ōdomaribama Site (circa 12th century) of Hateruma, the Yaeyama Islands, which Okinawan archaeologists consider represents the final stage of the potteryless culture. The Sumiya Site of Miyako Island has kamuiyaki and soapstone cauldrons but no white glazed ware. Kamuiyaki were excavated more often in Miyako than in Yaeyama. With the introduction of the combination of kamuiyaki, soapstone cauldrons and white glazed wares, Miyako and Yaeyama departed from a distinct potteryless culture and entered a pottery culture, which is sometimes known as the Suku Culture. It means that these southern island groups were finally integrated into a large culture (in an archaeological sense) of northern origin.  Technological background  Yoshioka Yasunobu traces that kamuiyaki technological roots to Goryeo's unglazed stoneware. Some link kamuiyaki to the Sagariyama Kiln Sites of Kyūshū. However, Shinzato Akito argues that judging from typological differences in wares and kilns, kamuiyaki were not directly influenced by Sagariyama. Shinzato dismisses Yoshioka's hypothesis that kamuiyaki production was triggered by people from southern Kyūshū. He concludes that Hakata (northern Kyūshū)-based merchants may brought Goryeo potters to Tokunoshima. They monopolized the wide-area trading network that connected Japan to Song China and Goryeo, which is confirmed by mass excavation of Chinese and Goryeo pottery in Hakata and Dazaifu. Yoshioka and Shinzato separately proposed their chronologies of kamuiyaki. However, Ikeda Yoshifumi pointed out their incompatibility with a recently excavated archaeological site in Amami.  Interpretations  Some archaeologists consider that kamuiyaki were exchanged for Turbo shells (yakōgai). Massive amounts of Turbo shells were excavated from archaeological sites of the Amami Islands, dating from the 7th century onwards. Turbo shells were consumed in mainland Japan. For example, nearly 30 thousand pieces of Turbo shells were used at Chūson-ji of Hiraizumi (northeastern Japan) in the 12th century. Asato Susumu claimed that the one who had distributed kamuiyaki and soapstone cauldrons from Amami to Yaeyama was \\"Ryūkyū's merchants\\" (琉球の商人). Ikeda Yoshifumi dismisses this claim and assumes an \\"external power\\" that saw the whole archipelago as a trading market. With progress in Amami's archaeological investigation, Takanashi Osamu dropped his earlier kamuiyaki-for-Turbo-shell hypothesis. He noted kamuiyaki's skewed distribution: the major points of consumption were limited to Kikai Island and Tokunoshima of the Amami Islands. The number of kamuiyaki pieces found in Okinawa, Miyako and Yaeyama was small and that was the reason why local earthenwares imitating kamuiyaki were produced there. Takanashi hypothesized that the primary purpose of kamuiyaki production in Tokunoshima had been to supply a demand for commodities at the Gusuku Site Complex of Kikai Island, an supposed outpost of the State of Japan.

It is the same bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans. Sylvatic, or sylvan, means 'occurring in wildlife,' and refers specifically to the form of plague in rural wildlife. Urban plague refers to the form in urban wildlife. It is primarily transmitted among wildlife through flea bites and contact with infected tissue or fluids. Sylvatic plague is most commonly found in prairie dog colonies and some mustelids like the black-footed ferret. Transmission vector The flea that feeds on prairie dogs and other mammals serves as the vector for transmission of Sylvatic plague to the new host, primarily through flea bites, or contact with contaminated fluids or tissue, through predation or scavenging. Humans can contract plague from wildlife through flea bites and handling animal carcasses. Epidemiology and distribution Yersinia pestis circulates in rodent and prairie dog reservoirs on all continents except Australia. Sylvatic plague affects over 50 species of rodents worldwide. It is vectored by a variety of flea species. Non-rodent animals susceptible to the disease include shrews, Lagomorphs, ferrets, badgers, skunks, weasels, coyotes, domestic dogs and cats, bobcats, mountain lions, camels, goats, sheep, pigs, deer, and primates including humans. Birds are not known to be susceptible. Sylvatic plague is normally enzootic, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas. At unpredictable times it becomes epizootic in unexpected places. It is during these epizootic outbreaks that transmission to humans is most common. Factors that predispose to epizootic cycles include dense populations of rodents, multiple species of rodents in a particular area, and multiple rodent species in diverse habitats. Prairie dog colonies reach nearly 100% mortality rates during outbreaks. Prairie dogs are a keystone species and play a vital role as the primary prey of black footed ferrets. Developing methods to control plague is of high concern for preserving ferrets and the conservation of Western prairie and grassland ecosystems. Wildlife disease control and prevention Prairie dogs evolved over 3,000,000 years ago, and have been surviving sylvatic plague as a species for a long time. In the absence of understanding the natural prairie dog/plague cycles, dusting rodent dens with pesticides to kill fleas is currently the main method of controlling sylvatic plague in the wild, with some interest in using vaccines developing. An oral live vaccine for prairie dogs was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, from a recombinant raccoon poxvirus expressing plague antigens. It was originally developed by a Fort Detrick company in 2003 which showed it protected mice against lethal plague.

Describing her background, in an interview with Yvonne Brewster, she said: \\"I came from a family of educated mixed-race people in Trinidad, and we were readily exposed to music and the arts in general and the folklore....And our education was of course in the same pattern as most of the colonials. It was a British education and an English education, so we were doing Shakespeare and all that kind of thing and all the modern poets and Dickens.

The film was partly inspired by the 1959 science fiction film The Wasp Woman, which had been produced and directed by Roger Corman. The original title was Rejuvenatrix, although it has become more popularly known as The Rejuvenator, this included the UK and Brazil. Plot A rich actress, Ruth Warren, who has gotten too old for leading roles, hopes to restore her youthful beauty. For a few years she had been financing a scientist, Dr. Gregory Ashton, who is working on a formula for eternal youth. This formula involves withdrawing certain fluids from the human brain. Although Ashton had found a serum that reverses the aging process, it was not yet complete. However Warren threatens to cut funding if Ashton will not give her the serum. Despite the warnings of danger, she willingly volunteers to become a human laboratory rat and takes the serum. The operation is successful and the rejuvenated woman regains her beauty, dubbing herself Elizabeth. However she does not realize that Ashton had to use the brains of dead bodies to get the chemical needed for the formula, which she must continue being injected with, and this leaves a limited supply shortly after. The experiment has unforeseen side effects, and turns Warren into a monster, who resorts to murder in her lust for human brains.

Homyak as Tony the Guard * Irene Fitzpatrick as Nurse Jones Production The film originally came about through director Brian Thomas Jones and Steven Mackler, who would produce the film. Mackler contacted Jones after he was impressed with his 1984 short-film Overexposed, a film about photojournalists on assignment in El Salvador. Mackler made a deal with Sony Video Software - SVS Films - in 1987, which involved the creation of three feature films. He soon contacted Jones so that they could collaborate on a film together. Mackler sent him a script titled Skin, which was written by Simon Nuchtern, specifically as a vehicle for special effects make-up artist Ed French. In an interview with Matty Budrewicz for UK Horror Scene, Jones stated \\"I read the script and, when I finished, I said to myself \\"I can't direct this script, but I know how to make this movie. It's Bride of Frankenstein meets Sunset Boulevard! I pitched the concept to Mackler and he let me rewrite it.\\" Although much of the structure was kept the same, including the special effects, Jones rewrote the script to include his own ideas. He stated \\"Like I said, I've never really been a true fan of blood, guts and gore so when I was writing I tried to weave in all these themes of vanity, addiction, obsession and greed. I really wanted to make it my own movie—something really heartfelt and dramatic.\\" The filming of Rejuventrix took twenty-two days to shoot, two-days longer than scheduled. The project's expense came to approximately $230,000 after post production. The main filming location was in New York City, United States. The mansion within the film was located in New Jersey, with the film crew shooting the first four days of the project there. Ashton's lab had been discovered by Jones when he was at the production offices and noticed two polaroids on production manager Bob Zimmerman's desk. These were of an abandoned tuberculosis hospital on State Island. The lab was later used in the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder. Within the film, American all-female heavy metal group Poison Dolly's made an appearance performing live at a nightclub. The group performed two songs; \\"Turn Out the Lights\\" and \\"Nice Boy\\" - both of these tracks exclusive to the film. Speaking of Vivian Lanko, Jones recalled she was \\"committed\\" and \\"endured hours of effects application and removal\\". He added: \\"She was fascinated by the character and the transformation. Her chemistry with John McKay was just great. He and Vivian were two of the best things that happened with the movie and I think the movie works as well as it does because of them.\\" Upon its release, Jones and Mackler had planned to use initial positive reviews to re- market the film as a \\"modern midnight movie\\". However SVS were less optimistic about the film and decided to book only a limited theatrical run of one week in New York. Jones believed the film had \\"cult potential but never got the opportunity\\". SVS also interfered with the film's title, of which there were several working titles, including \\"Scream Queen\\". A friend of Jones, Mark Carducci, came up with the title \\"Rejuvenatrix\\", which SVS went with, however Jones felt the title should have been \\"Psychotronic\\". Rejuvenatrix debuted within America during July 1988. On 31 October 1988 it had its video premiere, released by Sony/Columbia-Tristar under the title The Rejuvenator. In West Germany it had a video premiere in May 1989, and in 1991 it was released in Portugal. In the UK the film was given a VHS release via Castle Home Video. The Brazilian VHS release was issued by Taipan Vídeo. In 2013, CMV Laservision issued the film on DVD in Germany - the first DVD release of Rejuvenatrix. In the early 2014 interview for UK Horror Scene, Budrewicz described the film as \\"a marvellous, Gothic sci-fi frightener - a kooky and ever-so-slightly-kinky hybrid of Cronenberg, The Wasp Woman and Billy Wilder's noir classic Sunset Boulevard.\\" Jones noted: \\"I've always been quite disappointed it never got the exposure or recognition I feel it deserved, even though it has developed its fans from those lucky enough to have seen it. The reviews and the fact it did OK on video... I probably should let it go but I'll always hold a grudge for that SVS guy who didn't understand the genre or its fandom and realise the potential of what he had.\\" The film was Vivian Lanko's debut appearance. Married to actor Martin Donovan, she would only appear in two other films The Refrigerator (1991) and Simple Men (1992). Reception Variety magazine noted the film's \\"Elaborate make-up effects\\", while also stating that the film was \\"Designed to appeal to connoisseurs of contemporary horror\\". Dan Pavlides from Allmovie gave the film two and a half stars out of five, commending the film's special effects. Ryne Barber from Horror News.net gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"In all, The Rejuvenator is a mad scientist film that hits all of the tropes but does them all rather uninterestingly. The plot is too repetitive and obvious, and the film never falls into the category of B-movies where it’s so laughable that it becomes fun to watch. Instead, it’s a film that won’t find much of an audience anywhere, except maybe with those people who remember it nostalgically. But for those who haven’t seen it, The Rejuvenator doesn’t deserve to be revived.\\" Jones later recalled some of the critical reception of the film at the time of its release, in relation to his attempt add a more heartfelt and dramatic side to the film; \\"The reviews of it in NY Daily News, Fangoria, Variety and Cinefantastique all mentioned the characters and story, saying that it really set it apart from the crowd of low budget horror films. One of the nicest compliments I got was from a professor of mine in grad school, who taught critical theory for art. He watched the film and said that I elevated the movie above the genre with a genuine affection for the characters.\\" References External links  * Category:1988 horror films Category:American science fiction films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1980s monster movies Category:Mad scientist films Category:1988 films Category:American monster movies ","title":"Rejuvenatrix"},{"id":"40087994","text":"Dijana Bolanča Paulić (born 30 October 1974 in Zagreb) is a Croatian theatre, film and television actress .

The film's world premiere was held on May 19, 2014 at the GI Film Festival. Reception In a review of the film, Jeffrey Evan Brooks, author of alternate history novels about the Civil War, criticized the portrayal of the VMI cadets as being opposed to slavery. This was historically inaccurate, as most white Virginia men in the 1860s supported slavery. In addition, the majority of these cadets would have been planters' sons, with even more reason to support slavery. Brooks said it was unsupported historical revisionism. The Hollywood Reporter also criticized the film for being inauthentic about the cadets' attitudes.

History  Aeromodelling started in Australia in the early 1900s following the invention of the aeroplane however, it was not until the 1930s that organised modelling groups appeared. Two rival groups formed in NSW, the MAA, Model Aeroplane Association of Australia in 1930 and the MFC, Model Flying Club of Australia in 1931. The two groups merged in 1947 to become the Model Aeronautical Association of Australia or MAAA.MODEL AERONAUTICAL ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA INC. NEWSLETTER No. 05/2012 The first national competition was held in 1938 and was organised as entertainment to coincide with Australia's 150th Anniversary. The competition was actually called the Grand International Model Aeroplane Championships and included indoor and outdoor Free Flight models only, a total of five events. It was hoped that model flyers from the UK and USA would come to the competition however it ended up being only Australian's and New Zealander's who attended.MODEL AERONAUTICAL ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA INC. NEWSLETTER No. 05/2012 World War 2 prevented any further flying competitions from occurring due to ban on model flying during the war, so as such, no competitions were held between 1939 and 1947.

The Society is a descendant of the church begun by Archbishop Arnold Harris Mathew in 1910 and formerly part of the Church of Utrecht. The Society maintains the traditional dogmas of Catholic Christianity while emphasizing the necessity of a pastoral approach.Myers, William. \\"An Old Roman Catholic Catechism\\" Beliefs The Society of Mercy maintains the dogmatic beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church prior to the First Vatican Council. This means that the dogmas of Papal Infallibility and the Immaculate Conception are rejected as dogmatic articles. They may be held as doctrine by faithful, however. There is particular emphasis on the beliefs and practices of the early church. The church describes itself as pastoral on issues of morality, and emphasizes the primacy of a well formed conscience. The church maintains the three-fold ministries of bishop, priest, and deacon. Also important is the concept of apostolic succession. External objects used in worship and devotions include statues and icons as well as other items typical of high church worship. History The Church of Utrecht was permitted to elect its own bishops in 1145. This situation was confirmed in 1215 by the Fourth Lateran Council as well as by Pope Leo X in 1540.Neale, J.M. \\"The So-Called Jansenist Church of Holland\\" In 1705, the archbishop of the Church of Utrecht, Petrus Codde was deposed by the Pope and accused of Jansenism. The chapter elected their bishop who was consecrated by Bishop Dominique Marie Varlet. The Pope also appointed his own candidate. The Church of Utrecht continued outside of the authority of the Pope. In 1853, the relationship was further strained as Pope Pius IX appointed bishops for the Dutch Church. Until that time, Roman Catholics who did not break with the Old Roman Catholics were led by a vicar apostolic. The Church of Utrecht was joined in 1870 by those clergy and laity who objected to the First Vatican Council. The Union of Utrecht was formed to incorporate the various groups within Continental Europe. They began to use the title Old Catholic to distinguish themselves from the Roman Catholic Church.Moss, C.B. \\"Old Catholics: Their Origins and History The Old Catholic Church in Great Britain was established in 1908 with the consecration of the former Roman Catholic priest Arnold Harris Mathew. In 1910, he broke with the Old Catholics over what he believed to be increasing modernism in their beliefs and practices. The church was re-named The Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain. Archbishop Mathew consecrated Archbishop Rudolph de Landes-Berghes to head the church in the United States in 1914. De Landes-Berghes consecrated Carmel Henry Carfora, who led the church when de Landes-Berges joined the Roman Catholic Church. Carfora headed the church until 1958, and it at one time boasted over 50 parishes.Trela, Johnathan. \\"The North American Old Roman Catholic Church\\" However, several groups left for Orthodoxy and when Carfora died the church split into various factions. Since 1958, there have been attempts to gather together the various dioceses and jurisdictions that constituted the church.Myers, William. \\"Old Roman Catholicism\\" In 2013 the Old Roman Catholic Church in America re-united with the original British Church, the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain. In 2016, the clergy of the Old Roman Catholic Church in America began to discuss re-structuring as a priestly society.

Described by Pevsner as a \\"peach\\" and a \\"delectable folly\\", it stands beside the village market place, at the head of a T-junction on Bargate Street, facing onto Stafford Street. The house is an interesting combination of \\"Gothick\\" and Classical architecture: the symmetrical brick façade has two canted bays, each of three storeys, either side of a pillared entrance with ogee portico and octagonal-panelled door. There are five windows around each bay on each floor, and a single window on the two floors above the entrance, with decorative plasterwork arranged in tiers of round-headed arches with keystones and ogee arches rising to pinnacles surmounted by acorns. The glazing is arranged in a delicate tracery, originally of hexagons (although the glazing bars are not original on the ground and first floors). The façade is finished by a modillion cornice and parapet, concealing a hipped slate roof with brick chimney stacks. The interior includes one surviving decorative plaster ceiling and a Chinese Chippendale staircase with fretted balustrade. The house became a grade II listed building in 1953. The designer is unknown but some sources suggest Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who worked nearby in Shropshire. The house has some similarities with Sandhurst House in Stourbridge, and Shenstone Hall near Lichfield. The design may have been inspired by the books published in the 1740s by Batty Langley, who attempted to improve Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions. Speedwell Castle was reputedly built by a local apothecary William Rock, using the winnings from betting on the Duke of Bolton's racehorse, Speedwell. (An alternate story is that the builder owned an unsuccessful racehorse, and said that he would build a castle to celebrate if it ever won). After a period as the home of the classics master at Brewood Grammar School in the second half of the 19th century, it became a reading room in the late 19th century. It was then used as shops and storage until the 1930s, when it was converted to residential flats.

The $12-million attraction was announced in April 2013, and construction began the following month. Six months later, the ride opened to the general public on 1 November 2013. The Abyss is a Euro-Fighter, a roller coaster model from Gerstlauer that features a \\"beyond-vertical\\" first drop which exceeds 90 degrees. In addition to several inversions, the Abyss reaches a top speed of along the two-minute, ride. The roller coaster has been well received by the public. History In mid-2012, the 15-month phase of planning and construction of Abyss began. In April 2013, Adventure World announced on their Facebook page that they would be adding a $12 million, world-class attraction in 2013. By May 2013 construction had begun. In June 2013, a concrete slab was poured prior to the construction of a show building. Shortly after track arrived in July 2013, Adventure World officially announced that the ride would be a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter, similar to Saw – The Ride. Construction of the ride was completed by Gerstlauer crews over seven weeks. The name of the attraction was revealed on the Friday the 13th of September 2013 as Abyss. The announcement was made on Friday the 13th due to the ride's horror theme. Abyss officially opened to the public on 1 November 2013 as the single biggest investment in the park's history. Adventure World's CEO Mark Shaw stated the addition of the Abyss was an attempt to elevate the park \\"from adventure park to theme park\\". The park expected double-digit attendance growth following the addition of the ride. Prior to the 2013 opening of Abyss, Adventure World's only roller coaster was Dragon Express, a small junior roller coaster by Zamperla. Adventure World previously operated the Anton Schwarzkopf-designed Turbo Mountain, before its closure and removal in 2009. Characteristics Abyss is a custom Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with of track. The ride's vertical lift hill takes riders to a height of before dropping in a 100°, beyond-vertical drop. The two-minute ride features a top speed of and exerts up to 4.5 times the force of gravity on its riders. Abyss contains three inversions including an inline twist enclosed in the ride's show building, as well as an Immelmann loop and a dive loop outdoors. The ride features four trains which each seat riders four-abreast in two rows. The theming around the ride was manufactured in the Philippines and includes thirty ancient druid guardians, exposed tree roots, upturned trees, and an entrance archway. Ride experience The ride begins at the station inside the show building. Once the train departs the station, it makes a slow turn to the right. A quick drop follows, before the train rounds a series of left turns into the first inversion, an inline twist. The train emerges from the show building and makes a slight left towards the chain lift hill. Once at the top of the hill, riders drop down at an angle of 100°. The second inversion of the ride, an Immelmann loop, is followed by an overbanked turn around. An air- time hill, where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness, and a right turn leads into the mid-course brake run. The train exits the brake run with a left turn into a dive loop. A left turn leads the train into the final brake run, before returning to the enclosed station. Reception Abyss has been well received. Edwin Dickinson of the Australian Coaster Club praised Abyss for its smoothness, intensity and pacing. He described the ride as better than Superman Escape at Warner Bros. Movie World, stating Adventure World \\"certainly lifted the bar for roller coasters in Australia\\". The Australian Associated Press commended the ride's ability to continue to be thrilling after multiple rides. Natalie Bonjolo of Today Tonight stated she didn't \\"know whether to laugh or cry\\" at the end of Abyss, describing the ride as unbelievable.

This revision caused unrest in Chiapas's Southern Mexican state, as many indigenous tribes believed the article's revision negatively affected them due to the new economic policies. Violence ensued over several years, and the many peace deals proposed by the Mexican government were rejected. In the early days of the new government administration, President Ernesto Zedillo took a series of decisions that contradicted decisions from the earlier administration.  Political context  = 1994 Mexico Political Assassinations = Prior to the 1994 Mexico general election and the presidential inauguration, there were politically motivated assassinations directly tied to the 1994 Presidential elections and internal warfare between factions of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Luis Donaldo Colosio, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's handpicked successor and PRI presidential candidate, was assassinated on March 1994, and Ernesto Zedillo, financial policy expert and Colosio's campaign manager, was the new PRI presidential candidate despite never holding an elective office before nor serving as a member of the PRI's inner circle. The other high-level political assassination was José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, PRI Secretary-General and President Salinas' former brother-in-law. The murder laid bare the conflict among the political elites.Andrés Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity. Boston: Little Brown and Company 1996, pp. 111-127; 316-318 = Government Investigation = The Mexican government investigated the political crimes, and to give credibility to the investigations of these political crimes, President Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia, a member of the opposition political party National Action Party (PAN), as Attorney General. Raúl Salinas de Gortari, the older brother of former president Salinas, was implicated and arrested for Francisco Ruiz Massieu's assassination with President Zedillo's approval of the arrest, breaking with the tradition that sitting presidents protect their predecessor. President Zedillo received lukewarm support from his own party PRI, and as a series of crises struck his administration, he had no secure influence in the PRI to back him.  Lacandon Jungle secret meeting  On January 5, 1995, the Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma began a secret meeting process with Subcomandante Marcos called \\"Steps Toward Peace\\" They took place in the village of Guadalupe Tepeyac, belonging to the municipality of Pantelho, Chiapas. Important specific agreements that both parties agreed to comply with were reached, in which the Mexican army withdraw of particular points, such as San Andres Larrainzar, and Marcos accepted a group of citizens to be involved in a formal negotiation to start in a couple of weeks. Due to the fast progress of talks in the steps toward peace, the possibility of an agreement looked very close, and thus Marcos wrote, \\"I am being threatened by unemployment\\".Zedillo rompió acuerdo de paz con el EZLN  Identity  During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the Mexican government speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away his former fellow Zapatistas' identity to the Mexican government, among them Marcos. They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued, and arrests were made in military action. The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures for a short military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in Tampico, Tamaulipas to Spanish immigrants, and a former professor at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana School of Sciences and Arts for the Design. After the government revealed Marcos's identity in January 1995, Max Appedole, an old friend with Marcos and classmate with the Jesuits at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, made a direct intervention in the conflict. Max played a significant role with the Mexican government to avoid a military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guillén was not a terrorist. Max Appedole identified his linguistic fingerprint-based in Marcos's specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos manifestos published in the media, and linked them to the literary tournaments organized by the Jesuits. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, and that Guillen was a pacifist. Max Appedole thus closed the first successful Linguistic Profiling Confirmation Case in the history of Law Enforcement. This new science was developed based on these achievements, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics; this motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.«Marcos en la mira de Zedillo»Sí es Sebastián Guillén»Otra Campana Pintada de Azul» The military site  Once Subcomandante Marcos was identified as Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, on February 9, 1995, President Ernesto Zedillo took a series of decisions that completely broke with the previous strategy. The action plan previously defined, and the agreements he authorized his Secretary of Interior Lic Esteban Moctezuma to compromise with Marcos just three days before in Guadalupe Tepeyac. Zedillo ordered the Mexican army to capture or annihilate Marcos. This was done without consulting his Secretary of Interior, without even knowing exactly who Marcos was; with the PGR's single presumption that Marcos was a dangerous guerrilla, President Ernesto Zedillo decided to launch a military offense to capture or annihilate Marcos and the Zapatistas. Arrest warrants were made against Marcos, Javier Elorriaga Berdegue, Silvia Fernández Hernández, Jorge Santiago, Fernando Yanez, German Vicente, Jorge Santiago, and other Zapatistas. At the Lacandon Jungle, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation came under Mexican Army military siege. Javier Elorriaga was captured on February 9, 1995, in a military garrison at Gabina Velázquez in Las Margarita's town and later taken to the Cerro Hueco prison in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. On February 11, 1995, the PGR claimed they captured 14 persons presumed to be involved with the Zapatistas, of which eight already being turned to the Judicial Authorities and seized a critical arsenal. The PGR arrested the San Cristóbal de Las Casas Catholic Bishop, Samuel Ruiz García, for allegedly concealing the Zapatistas guerrilla activity. In response, Mexico-Vatican diplomatic relations deteriorated, partly because of the May 24, 1993, political assassination of a Prince of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara, Mexico, that the PGR had left unsolved. Marcos's resolve was put to the test in his camp in the Lacandon Jungle when the Zapatistas were under the Mexican Army military siege. Marcos's response was immediate, sending Esteban Moctezuma the following message: \\"See you in hell\\". Conflicting signals got strengthened in favor of a fast military solution. The facts seemed to confirm Manuel Camacho Solis's 16 June 1994 accusations that his resignation as the Chiapas Peace Commissioner was due to sabotage done by the presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo. Mexico Secretary of the Interior Lic. Esteban Moctezuma believed a peaceful solution was possible. He attempted to reach a peacefully negotiated solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, betting it all on a strategy to reestablish the Mexican Government Zapatista Army of National Liberation dialog to search for peace, demonstrating Marcos genuine pacifist disposition and the consequences of a military solution. Making a strong position against the February 9 actions against Peace, Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma submitted his resignation to President Ernesto Zedillo, which was not accepted. For these primary reasons, the Mexican army eased actions, giving an opportunity that Marcos capitalized on to escape the military site he was placed in the Lacandon Jungle. Faced with this situation, Max Appedole asked for help from Edén Pastora, the legendary Nicaraguan \\"Commander Zero\\", to prepare a report for under-Secretary of the Interior Luis Maldonado on Marcos's degree of pacifism, if any.\\"Tampico la conexion zapatista\\". Archived from the original on 3 November 2013. The document concluded that the complaints of marginalized groups and the radical left in México had been vented through the Zapatistas movement, while Marcos maintained an open negotiating track. If Marcos were eliminated, his function as a safety-valve for at social discontent would cease and more-radical groups could take his place. These groups would respond to violence with violence, threatening terrorist bombings, kidnappings and even more belligerent activities. The country would then be plunged into a very dangerous downward spiral, with discontent surfacing in areas other than Chiapas.  Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation, and a peace with dignity in Chiapas Law  On March 10, 1995, President Ernesto Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation, and a peace with dignity in Chiapas Law. It was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress.  Restoration of the peace talks  On the night of 3 April 1995 at 8:55 pm, the Secretary of Interior, Lic. Esteban Moctezuma sent Luis Maldonado to deliver a letter to representatives of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. The letter expressed the Secretary of Interior's commitment to a political path to resolve the conflict. In contrast to many other talks—with broad media exposure, strong security measures, and great ceremony—Maldonado decided on secret talks, alone, without any disruptive security measures. He went to the Lacandon Jungle to meet with Marcos; the secret negotiations took place in Prado Pacayal, Chiapas, and were witnessed by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Batel. Marcos and Maldonado established parameters and a location for the peace dialogue between the parties. Secret negotiations to restart the dialog between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government were initiated. These negotiations took place to establish parameters and base for the peace dialog between the parties. After several days of unfruitful negotiations, it was very early in the morning nonstop into the next day without reaching any specific agreements. In a strategically calculated move, Luis Maldonado proposed a definitive suspension of hostilities and distention measures always proportionally higher to the Mexican government to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. On his way out, Luis Maldonado said: \\"If you do not accept this, it will be regretted not having made the installation of the formal dialog in the time established by the Peace Talks Law\\". Marcos took this as a direct threat, so he did no longer reply. The Subcomandante Marcos gave a message to the Witness of Honor Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Batel: > You have been witness to the fact that we have not threatened or assaulted > these people, they have been respected in their person, property, their > liberty, and life. You have witnessed that the Zapatista Army of National > Liberation has a word and has honor; you have also been witness to our > willingness to engage in dialog. Thank you for taking the trouble to come > all the way down here and have contributed with your effort to a peaceful > settlement of the conflict; we hope that you will continue contributing in > this effort to avoid war and you and your family continue accepting to be > witnesses of honor in this dialog and negotiation process. Finally, he asked the witness of honor to accompany Secretary Moctezuma negotiator Luis Maldonado in his way out, all the way to Ocosingo, to verify they are leaving well and unharmed. (April 7, 1995, meeting ended at 4:00 a.m.)  Peace  Without much hope of dialogue, it was already in hostile conditions as the Secretary of Interior negotiator Luis Maldonado began his return to Mexico City. When passing by the Ejido San Miguel, a patrol of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation beckons them to stop, surprised without even knowing what was happening, he was handed a radio, by means of which Mexico under-Secretary of Interior Luis Maldonado achieved with the Subcomandante Marcos the re-initiation of the Dialog with all the necessary agreements per the Law to start the formal Peace Talks dialog between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government. The Zapatista's charismatic leader, Marcos, led the Zapatistas movement to leave arms aside and start the dialog for a peace agreement.«Diputados Convergencia»  Protocol  By April 9, 1995, the Dialog Protocol's Bases and the harmony, peace with justice and dignity agreement Negotiation between the Mexican government and the Zapatistas got signed. On April 17, 1995, the Mexican government appointed Marco Antonio Bernal as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas. Peace Talks between the Mexican Government and the Zapatistas started in San Andrés Larráinzar on April 22, 1995. The Zapatistas rejected the Mexican Government proposal. Peace Talks Dialog reinitiated on June 7, 1995, they agree with Alianza Cívica Nacional y the Convención Nacional Democrática to organize a national Consultation for Peace and Democracy. The Bases for the Dialog Protocol was renegotiated, in La Realidad Chiapas. October 12, 1995 Peace Talks Dialog is resumed in San Andres Larráinzar, Chiapas.«Chronology»  The other agenda  The rocky road to peace between the Mexican government and the Zapatistas was due mostly to the initiatives promoted by the PGR. On October 23, 1995, to derail the Peace Talks Dialog, the PGR arrested and send Fernando Yañez Muñoz to prison. Once again, not only the Peace Talks got seriously disturbed, these actions violated the governing peace talks Law, which granted a guarantee of free passage to all of the Zapatistas during the negotiations and suspended all the arrest warrants against any of them. On October 26, 1995, the Zapatista National Liberation Army denied any association with Fernando Yañez Muñoz, and announced a Red Alert. Marcos returns to the mountains. On October 26, 1995, the PGR dropped all charges against the alleged Comandante German. The COCOPA agreed with the determination. The next day on October 27, 1995, Fernando Yañez Muñoz was freed from the Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente.«alzamiento y lucha Zapatista Pag. 7» He said, \\"I was arrested for political reasons and I guess I am set free for political reasons. My arrest was with the objective purpose of sabotaging the peace talks.\\" On 29 October 1995 the Zapatistas lifted the Red Alert and negotiations resumed.  Secret meetings  =Steps Toward Peace = In contrast with many other talks, with a broad media exposure, strong security measures, and great ceremony, Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma, went for the secret talks, alone, without any security measures, without the reflectors glitter, which could disrupt the talks, so he went to find a solution in the Lacandon Jungle to meet with Marcos. Important agreements were reached between the two, they called them: Steps Toward Peace. They demonstrated their sense of will, affinities and confidence were dispensed with mutual respect, and a significant track of understanding got established. When the 1995 Zapatista Crisis started, it paved the way for what they were called =Secret negotiations= To which under-Secretary of Interior Luis Maldonado attended to find a solution, alone, without any security measures, or media coverage, he went to the Lacandon Jungle to negotiate with Marcos and that he did, Luis Maldonado restored the conditions for the Peace Talks. These simple acts of courage, determination, and confidence were later matched by Marcos probing to be useful to help keep the faith in the works for a peaceful solution, through negotiation, champion by Esteban Moctezuma, from the Mexican Secretary of Interior during the series of clashes promoted by the PGR to derail peace. The San Andrés Accords On 16 February 1996, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and Mexican government, signed The San Andrés Accords. With the Terms of Peace and the Constitutional change that guarantees the rights to the Indigenous peoples of Mexico. Approved by the Commission on Concordance and Pacification COCOPA, a bicameral Legislative Commission formed in March 1995 by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, integrated by Deputies and Senators, of all the political Parties in Mexico to assist in the peace dialog process in the context of the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. With delegates from 42 countries. On 27 July 1996, the EZLN organized the First Intercontinental Gathering for Humanity and against the neoliberal practice. Executive decision Time showed that the fight against a military solution to the conflict and the strategy to achieve a peaceful solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis was legal, politically, and honorably correct, saving many lives in México. After a rocky start because of conflicting intelligence that caused the 1995 Zapatista Crisis President Ernesto Zedillo was heading to a Military solution, and when the intelligence issue was cleared, confirming that Subcomandante Marcos was no terrorist but a pacifist by nature, as well as all the other conclusions that Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma also gave to the President Ernesto Zedillo with the purpose of trying to avoid a bloodbath of the Mexican indigenous people, as well to prevent other also terrible repercussions of an immoral and unnecessary tragic outcome. President Ernesto Zedillo to avoid innocent blood-shedding, change the course of action doing the opposite of his February 9, 1995, television appearance. For that Zedillo endured heavy political criticism at the time, he demonstrated a humility of a Man of State, President Ernesto Zedillo did not accept Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma resignation and ask him to restore Dialog conditions to achieve a peaceful solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On March 10, 1995, President Ernesto Zedillo and Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma sign the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas Law. The governing Law that warrants to have only one agenda in all of President Zedillo Administration, as well the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional to achieve an honorable peace and it is now a universal reference and example of respect to people honor and dignity.  Release of the prisoners  On appeal, the Court dismisses the previous condemnatory Sentence for the alleged Zapatistas Javier Elorriaga Berdegué and Sebastian Etzin Gomez given on May 2, 1996, for the crime of terrorism, with 13 and 6 years of imprisonment respectively and they were released on June 6, 1996.«La Jornada: 16 meses despues» The EZLN suspends their troops Alert Status.

He is the author of best-selling books The Etymologicon, The Horologicon, and The Elements of Eloquence, as well as being known for his blog The Inky Fool. Forsyth's earlier work was based around the meaning of words and more specifically, obscure and out-of-use words. His first two books were featured on BBC Radio 4's series Book of the Week. In June 2012, Forsyth gave a TEDX talk entitled \\"What’s a snollygoster? A short lesson in political speak\\". Education Forsyth attended Winchester College in Winchester, Hampshire, England from 1990 to 1995. He also studied English Language & Literature at Lincoln College, Oxford University from 1996 to 1999. Career =The Inky Fool= As a self-described journalist, proofreader, ghostwriter and pedant, Forsyth started a blog called the Inky Fool in 2009 as a forum to share his love of words. His posts often involve an exploration of words; where they come from and how they relate to each other. \\"Etymology is fun,\\" Forsyth said in a Skepticality interview, \\"Some people talk about the true meaning. I just find it interesting and delightful and often just very, very funny. That's the main thing I love about etymology.\\" =The Etymologicon= The popularity of Inky Fool led to Forsyth's first book publishing deal in 2011 with Icon Books. In The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll Through the Hidden Connection of The English Language, Forsyth explains the meanings and derivations of well-known words and phrases, and explores the strange connections between words in a stream-of-consciousness fashion. The book's title, originally called Point Blank Check Mate: The Inky Fool's Book of Word Association, references the poet John Milton who purportedly invented the word \\"etymologicon\\" to describe a book containing etymologies. The book's structure leads the reader to \\"unexpected coinages and devious linkages, sexy, learned and satisfyingly obscure.\\" It is, according to reviewer Karin Schimke, \\"a cursory run through history presented with a wry eye and a peculiar sense of humor.\\" Reviewer Robert McCrum wrote, \\"Not since Eats, Shoots & Leaves has a book about language...attracted so much attention in bookshops, running through successive reprints.\\" The Etymologicon was a Sunday Times No. 1 Bestseller in January 2012. While The Etymologicon falls into the category of edutainment, the examples Forsyth includes in the book are well researched and supported by evidence. His goal was to include as much scholarly information as \\"lightly\\" as possible. Forsyth researches words and phrases as far back to their original sources as he can find. \\"Often, the joy of the research,\\" he said in a Chicago Tribune interview, \\"is finding examples of the original usages that have been lost for centuries. For example, humble pie used to be umble pie because the umbles were the innards of a deer (so it was the poor man's equivalent of venison pie). I actually found a recipe book from 1727 deep in the bowels of the British Library that gave instructions on how to make it. So I did. And it was delicious.\\" In The Etymologicon, Forsyth cautions against what he calls \\"the danger of inductive reasoning\\" when determining the commonality among diverse languages. Some patterns in language, he asserts, are mere coincidence and linguists meticulously document specific examples of word and sound changes to determine whether or not disparate languages are, indeed, connected. =The Horologicon= The Horologicon: A Day's Jaunt Through the Lost Words of the English Language is Forsyth's second book and contains \\"weird words for familiar situations.\\" Many of these words are no longer in use, such as snollygoster, durgeon and frumples. To avoid having his list of words \\"form what is technically known as a dictionary,\\" Forsyth arranges The Horologicon or Book of Hours according to the hours in a day: from dawn, through breakfast, commuting, office life, shopping, going out drinking and stumbling home. Forsyth believes some of these words should be revived: \\"Never mind the puzzled looks,\\" he says, \\"just use them. Throw them into conversation as often as possible.\\" A reviewer in The Daily Telegraph wrote: \\"From ante-jentacular to snudge by way of quafftide and wamblecropt, at last you can say, with utter accuracy, exactly what you mean.\\" =The Elements of Eloquence= The Elements of Eloquence: Secrets of the Perfect Turn of Phrase is Forsyth's third book. Described as a writer's tool-kit or recipe book, The Elements of Eloquence outlines 38 rhetorical figures (e.g., hyperbole, epizeuxis, catachresis) that, according to Forsyth, can be learned by almost anybody. Forsyth uses examples from William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Winston Churchill, Lord Tennyson, Lewis Carroll, Quentin Tarantino, John Lennon and Katy Perry to reveal \\"the secrets\\" behind memorable lines and phrases. One reviewer wrote: \\"It's doubtful that if more people knew Forsyth's The Elements of Eloquence, the world would be a better place, but it would certainly sound a great deal better.\\" =The Unknown Unknown= Forsyth's essay Unknown Unknown: Bookshops and the Delight of Not Getting What You Wanted was a special commission for Independent Booksellers Week. and celebrates the discoveries one can make at independent bookshops. In his essay, Forsyth makes the case for the lost pleasures of undirected browsing that cannot be achieved with an internet search. Reviewer Matthew Parris wrote: : As any sub-editor knows, and too few columnists acknowledge, a good headline can say it all. Mark Forsyth, whose passion is words, and whose book, The Etymologicon, proved probably the best-selling title in history that nobody can pronounce, has written an essay in booklet form to adorn the tables of Britain's bookshops. Its title page tells you succinctly why it should. The Unknown Unknown, it's called, and its subtitle is \\"Bookshops and the delight of not getting what you wanted.\\" Not since I engaged a company called Difficult Access Cranes Ltd has the point been made before, as it were, you've even opened the tin. =A Christmas Cornucopia= A Christmas Cornucopia: The Hidden Stories Behind Our Yuletide Traditions was published on 3 November 2016. =A Short History of Drunkenness= A Short History of Drunkenness came out on 6 September 2018. Other Books Forsyth wrote the introduction for the new edition of Collins English Dictionary. In it, he notes \\"There are few pastimes in life as pleasurable and profitable as reading the dictionary. The plot is, of course, rather weak, and the moral of the whole thing slightly elusive; but for my money there isn't another book that comes close to it.\\" He also wrote a short chapter, \\"Who Named All the Cities,\\" for a book compiled by Gemma Elwin Harris called Big Questions from Little People Answered by Some Very Big People.

That's chiasmus. * What I love about etymology is not the grand theories but the strange back alleys and extraordinary and ridiculous journeys that words take. * Of his book Horologicon, Forsyth said: It is for the words too beautiful to live long, too amusing to be taken seriously, too precise to become common, too vulgar to survive polite society, or too poetic to thrive in the age of prose. * There's absolutely no point in historians getting indignant about language. It's never going to stop changing – they're trying to hold back the tide like the Luddites. * Politics and advertising have always had a lot in common. They are both despised. They are both necessary if you want to shift the public. And they both rely on the consumer not knowing the figures of rhetoric. * Only in the bookshop, in the Good Bookshop, can you stumble across the book that you never knew you wanted, that will answer all the questions that you never knew to ask. It is there, waiting, but you cannot find it by searching. You must find it by chance. Somewhere on the shelf at the back, over to the right. * There is more to life than the figures of rhetoric; I just don't think there is much more.

It features actors Aaron Poole, James Gilbert, Alan C. Peterson, and Julian Richings. It tells the story of two documentary filmmakers who set out to create a film about a conspiracy theorist named \\"Terrance G\\" who disappears during the making of the film. The two filmmakers are subsequently drawn into the world of a global syndicate whose aims and machinations are clouded in secrecy.  Plot  After watching an online video that mocks a local conspiracy theorist, filmmakers Aaron and Jim decide to make a documentary about him. The man, Terrance G., agrees to show them the various newspaper clippings that he has collected and that he uses to draw connections between significant historical events, including World War I and the September 11 attacks. Impressed with the depth of his research, Aaron begins to sympathize with Terrance, while Jim remains skeptical. During an interview, Terrance becomes agitated and points out a man whom he believes to be following him. Shortly afterward, Terrance disappears without a trace. Worried, Aaron and Jim return to his apartment, which is being cleared out. Aaron manages to salvage the newspaper clippings. When his house is broken into, Aaron moves in with Jim, his wife, and their young child, where he attempts to figure out what each of the newspaper clippings has in common. It becomes apparent that Terrence had connected several significant historical events to the Tarsus Club, a non-governmental organization founded on an ancient secret society noted for the fact that its members tend to meet just before significant historical events, which has led conspiracy theorists to believe that the Tarsus Club is responsible for said events. The only evidence of its existence is a single article written in Time magazine by Mark Tucker. Unable to find further information about Tucker, Aaron and Jim turn to the Internet and solicit information from the public. A man claiming to be Tucker contacts them and agrees to meet for an interview on the condition that Aaron and Jim remove from the Internet everything that they have written about the Tarsus Club. During the interview, Tucker explains that the Tarsus Club worships Mithras and as such is said to sacrifice a bull at each of its meetings. Tucker later contacts Aaron and Jim with news that he can sneak them into the next meeting of the Tarsus Club, which will be held at a mansion in the woods. Armed with hidden cameras, the pair document their interactions with members at the meeting. Claiming to be new members, Aaron and Jim are forced to participate in an initiation ritual held outside in which new members declare their allegiance to Mithras and are given raven masks to wear for the remainder of the meeting. While waiting in line for the ritual, Aaron sees Tucker enter the meeting and greet various Tarsus Club members. Realizing that Tucker is a member himself, Aaron becomes worried that Jim, who was before him in line, is in danger. However, he calms down when he sees Jim leaving the ritual wearing a raven mask, and Aaron decides to go through with the ritual himself. Back inside the mansion, a member corners Jim and reveals that the Tarsus Club has brought his wife and their young child to the meeting. At the same time, Aaron finishes the initiation ritual only to be given a bull mask instead of a raven mask. The members then chase him through the woods. Although his hidden camera continues to record as the members catch Aaron and appear to attack him with knives, it does not show his ultimate fate. In an epilogue, members of the Tarsus Club perform a series of brief interviews in which they claim to have faked their attack on Aaron in order to scare him off, which is a usual practice with intruders into their meetings. The members are also seen editing the footage, now subsumed into a neutral or even positive documentary about the Tarsus Club. Although visibly shaken, Jim seems cooperative, agreeing with their version of events and adding that Aaron was released unharmed. However, he notes that Aaron was traumatized as a result and later disappeared. Jim theorizes that Aaron has joined Terrance, although he does not explain what this means. The Tarsus Club then reassures the audience that its members are not engaged in any nefarious conspiracies, but rather that it simply seeks world-wide cooperation between \\"governments, businesses, and individuals.\\"  Cast  * Aaron Poole as Aaron * James Gilbert as Jim * Alan Peterson as Terrance * Bruce Clayton as Mark Tucker * Roy Swanson as Murray Chance  Production  Writer and director Christopher MacBride said that a friend introduced him to conspiracy theories. According to him, \\"For several months I got lost down that rabbit hole and eventually a light bulb just went off and I realized there was a really compelling story to tell set in that world.\\" The film makes use of both actors and real-life people involved in the conspiracy community. MacBride said that he sees the film as an evenhanded faux documentary, not as \\"found footage\\".  Release  The Conspiracy premiered at the Fantastic Fest and was picked up by XLrator for distribution in the US. XLrator released on VOD on August 8, 2013, and in cinemas on August 23, 2013. It was released in the UK on October 11, 2013.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 88% of eight surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.5/10. Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star rated it 2/4 stars and called it \\"a tense but far-fetched thriller\\". Adam Nayman of The Globe and Mail rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that it \\"does more with a found-footage conceit than any horror movie since The Blair Witch Project.\\" John Patterson of The Guardian called it \\"both plausible and watchable\\", though it \\"can be faulted for its predictability\\". Joe Leydon of Variety called it \\"a modestly suspenseful faux documentary\\" that turns silly near the climax. Peter Martin of Twitch Film wrote, \\"With absolute conviction and unwavering intelligence, The Conspiracy unpacks complex theories and raises disturbing questions that are not easily dismissed.\\" Richard Whittaker of the Austin Chronicle wrote, \\"The Conspiracy succeeds, not just because it successfully mimics the post-Michael Moore generation of directors who love to put themselves in front of the camera. It succeeds because it mimics the fever-dream paranoia of conspiracy documentarians.\\" Matt Glasby of Total Film rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"plausible and chilling\\". Brad McHargue of Dread Central rated it 5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Conspiracy is one of the most original, creative, and genuinely frightening horror movies in recent memory.\\" Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"It’s unfortunate that the epilogue is so weak considering how fun, engaging and thought provoking the entire film is.\\" Scott Weinberg of Fearnet wrote that it \\"works resoundingly well.\\" One reviewer, writing in The Lexander Magazine, accused the filmmakers of plagiarizing a 2006 film entitled The Brandon Corey Story, which featured British conspiracy theorist David Icke.

It is caused by trauma (e.g. violence, accident or surgery) or infection. They most commonly develop about 8–14 days after injury. They are a relatively common complication following surgery to the salivary glands, commonly parotidectomy (removal of the parotid gland). In this case the sialocele is the result of saliva draining out of remaining parotid tissue, and occurs about 5 to 10% of cases of superficial (partial) parotidectomy. It is usually not painful, and a mild and self-limiting complication, and is managed by repeated aspiration (draining) of the swelling via a needle after the skin has been disinfected with an antibacterial. The fluid is usually a clear yellow, and contains amylase (in contrast to fluid from a seroma). Pressure dressings do not tend to be used. They are rarely chronic, however if persistent a surgical drain may be required. Botulinum toxin injections have also been used to manage this condition.

He calls it his first hard-boiled detective book. It was published on June 3, 2014. On June 10, 2014 the author described Mr. Mercedes on Twitter as the first volume of a projected trilogy, to be followed in the first half of 2015 by Finders Keepers, the first draft of which was finished around the time Mr. Mercedes was published, and End of Watch in 2016. The novel won the 2015 Edgar Award for Best Novel from the Mystery Writers of America and Goodreads Choice Awards for 2014 in the \\"Mystery and Thriller\\" category.  Background information  During his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title Mr. Mercedes and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long.\\"A Conversation with Stephen King\\". Chancellor's Speaker Series. University of Massachusetts Lowell. Retrieved December 14, 2012. In an interview with Parade, published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \\"more or less\\" completed. Describing the novel for an interview with USA Today, published on September 18, 2013, King said that while it was started prior to the Boston Marathon bombings, Mr. Mercedes involves a terrorist plot which is \\"too creepily close for comfort\\". An excerpt was published in the May 16, 2014 issue of Entertainment Weekly. Plot Many jobless people are standing in line for a job fair, but then a Mercedes plows into the crowd, killing eight and severely injuring many. Bill Hodges, a recently retired detective from the local police department living the life of a retiree, receives a letter from an individual claiming to be the person responsible for the job fair incident, referring to himself as \\"Mr. Mercedes\\". Hodges is divorced, lonely, and fed up with his life, occasionally considering suicide. The incident had taken place at the end of Hodges' career and was still unresolved when he retired. Mr. Mercedes knows details of the murder and also mentions Olivia Trelawney, from whom he had stolen the Mercedes. Olivia had committed suicide soon after the massacre out of guilt. Hodges is intrigued and starts to investigate the case instead of turning the letter over to his former police colleague, Pete Huntley. Brady Hartsfield, who is revealed to be Mr. Mercedes, is an emotionally disturbed psychopath in his late twenties who lost his father at age eight. When he was a young boy, he killed his mentally handicapped brother at his mother's prompting. He now lives with and has an incestuous relationship with his alcoholic mother and works in an electronics shop and as an ice-cream seller. Riding in a van, this second job enables him to observe Hodges and Hodges' neighbors, among them seventeen-year-old Jerome Robinson, who does small chores for Hodges. During his research about the wealthy Olivia Trelawney, Hodges meets her sister Janey, who hires him to investigate Olivia's suicide and the theft of the Mercedes. Shortly after Hodges begins to work for Janey, the two begin dating. Hodges finds out, with the help of bright, computer savvy Jerome, how Mr. Mercedes stole the car and then drove Olivia (whom he made contact with through his job at the electronics shop) to suicide by leaving eerie sound files on her computer that were set to go off at unpredictable intervals, which escalated her feelings of guilt. Olivia, when hearing these sounds, believed them to be the ghosts of the victims of the Mercedes Massacre. At the funeral of Janey and Olivia's recently deceased mother, Hodges meets Janey's unpleasant relatives, among them Janey's emotionally unstable cousin Holly. After the funeral, Mr. Mercedes blows up Hodges' car, not realizing that Hodges wasn't in it. However, Janey was, and she is killed in the explosion. Hodges feels remorse but becomes even more eager to solve the case without the help of the police. Holly joins Hodges and Jerome in the investigation. Hartsfield accidentally kills his mother with a poisoned hamburger, which he had prepared for Jerome's dog. With her rotting body in their house, he plans to kill himself by blowing himself up at a giant concert for young girls by feigning the need for a wheelchair and utilizing explosives hidden inside the wheelchair. Jerome, Hodges, and Holly manage to uncover Hartsfield's real identity and search his computer hard drives. They eventually deduce that Hartsfield's target is the concert, and the trio rush to the concert venue to stop him. Hodges begins to suffer a heart attack and is unable to venture into the concert with Holly and Jerome, but urges them to press on. Holly locates Hartsfield and delivers several harsh blows to his head using Hodges's \\"Happy Slapper\\" – a sock filled with ball bearings. Hartsfield is left bleeding and unconscious on the concert floor. Hodges (who had been saved by concert staff), Holly, and Jerome have a picnic to discuss the recently transpired events. Hodges has learned that he will not be criminally charged for his actions regarding the Hartsfield investigation. They have received medals from the city, congratulating them on their work.

Reception Mr. Mercedes received positive reviews, with many critics responding well to the book being different from King's \\"standard horror stories\\" and being a \\"compelling crime novel.\\" It received a 4.07/5 score on Goodreads, dropping to 3.87 as of 19 January with 43,562 ratings and a 4/5 on Barnes & Noble. Michael Marshall Smith of The Guardian noted the novel \\"is firmly positioned in suspense- thriller territory and the non-supernatural world – somewhere King evidently feels increasingly at home. … At its heart, Mr Mercedes is a traditional cat- and-mouse story about a psychopathic killer and the renegade cop who makes it his mission to bring him down.\\" Considering three levels of evaluation – quality per se, expectations of King's \\"readers who return for his distinctively unstoppable storytelling engine, his particular and hugely dependable voice\\", and rules of \\"whichever genre\\" King increasingly departs to, he sums up: \\"Good book? Hell, yes. Good Stephen King book? Absolutely.\\" Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the novel 3 and 1/2 stars: \\"With an accidental gumshoe and a freaky serial killer, … Mr. Mercedes takes the old detective genre in an excellent, modern direction\\". He commended \\"a fascinating look at what makes a serial killer in a post-9/11 context\\", adding that King also \\"really succeeds with Hodges' companions\\". Sheryll Connelly of The New York Daily News stated the novel is \\"telling a story that could almost be characterized as sweet except of course for the sociopath on a bloody rampage. King will be King, and he’s never less than scary. Who in their right mind would want him to be?\\" and noted that this is one of his books where instead of it being \\"horrific, King expresses outright tenderness and it’s evident here.\\" Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club was more reserved, writing that the novel opens with its best moment and \\"sags significantly in the middle, but it barrels toward a memorable conclusion … his tense, propulsive, ultra-fast- paced climax here seems like it was written with the movie in mind\\". Her main complaint was \\"a collection of laughably creaky old tropes at the center … a halfhearted stop at Señor Lazy’s Bargain Cliché Bin … predictable King-isms … a cutout character following a well-worn path\\". But she praised the novel for being \\"unusual in its dedication to surprising readers\\" and found it \\"a major step up from his previous book, Doctor Sleep\\". Adaptation In January 2015, it was announced that Mr. Mercedes would be turned into a limited television series. David E. Kelley was slated to write the project and Jack Bender would direct. Kelley and Stephen King serve as executive producers. On October 10, 2017, the Audience network announced that the TV series Mr. Mercedes was renewed for season 2, which would conclude the story from the original Mr. Mercedes novel.

It was the first American-designed and built front wheel drive car with independent front suspension. It followed the 1934 Citroën Traction Avant and the Cord L-29, both of which also had front wheel drive. Both models were also the first to offer hidden headlights. History The styling of the Cord 810 was the work of designer Gordon M. Buehrig and his team of stylists, which included young Vince Gardner and Alex Tremulis. While the first American front-wheel-drive car with independent front suspension, it had an archaic tube rear axle with semi-elliptic rear springs. Power came from a Lycoming V8 of the same as the L-29.Burgess-Wise, p. 437. The semi-automatic four-speed transmission (three plus overdrive) extended in front of the engine, like on a Traction Avant. This allowed Buehrig to dispense with the driveshaft and transmission tunnel; as a result, the new car was so low it required no running boards. It had a wheelbase (shared with several 812 body styles), and in 1936 came in four models: the entry-level sedan at US$1995, the Beverly sedan ($2095), Sportsman ($2145), and Phaeton ($2195).Kimes and Clark. Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1805-1942, p.364. The 1937 812s had the same models, priced $2445, $2545, $2585, and $2645, plus two more, on a wheelbase, the $2960 Custom Beverly and $3060 Custom Berline.Kimes and Clark, p.364.\\\\' Reportedly, conceived as a Duesenberg and nearly devoid of chrome, the 810 had hidden door hinges and rear-hinged hood, rather than the side- opening type more usual at the time, both new items. It featured pontoon fenders with hidden headlamps (modified Stinson landing lights) (E. L. Cord owned a majority of Stinson stock) that disappeared into the fenders via dashboard hand cranks. This car was first and one of the few ever to include this feature. It also featured a concealed fuel filler door and variable-speed windshield wipers (at a time when wipers were often operated by intake vacuum, and so tended to stop when the driver stepped on the gas pedal). Its engine- turned dashboard included complete instrumentation, a tachometer, and standard radio (which did not become an industry standard offering until well into the 1950s).Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.979. The most famous feature was the \\"coffin nose\\", a louvered wraparound grille, from which its nickname derived, a product of Buehrig's desire not to have a conventional grille. Supercharged 1937 Cord 812 Sedan The car caused a sensation at its debut at the New York Auto Show in November 1935. The crowds were so dense, attendees stood on the bumpers of nearby cars to get a look. Cord had rushed to build the 100 cars needed to qualify for the show, and the transmission was not ready. Even so, Cord took many orders at the show, promising Christmas delivery, expecting production of 1,000 per month, but the semi-automatic transmission was more troublesome than expected,Burgess-Wise, pp. 436-437. and 25 December came and went with no cars built. The first production cars were not ready to deliver until February, and did not reach New York City until April 1936. In all, Cord managed to sell only 1,174 of the new 810 in its first model year, as the result of mechanical troubles. Supercharging was made available on the 1937 812 model, with a mechanically driven Schwitzer-Cummins unit. Supercharged 812 models were distinguished from the normally aspirated 812s by the brilliant chrome-plated external exhaust pipes mounted on each side of the hood and grill. With supercharging, horsepower was raised to 170. Early reliability problems, including slipping out of gear and vapor lock, cooled initial enthusiasm. Although most new owners loved their sleek fast cars, the dealer base shrank rapidly. Unsold left-over and in-process 1936 810 models were re-numbered and sold as 1937 812 models. In 1937, after producing about 3000 of these cars, Auburn ceased production of the Cord. A single 1938 Cord prototype, with detail changes to the grille and transmission cover, was built, and it survived as of 2009. 1936 Cord 810 Phaeton Ironically, the next two American cars to use a front-wheel drive layout, the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado and 1967 Cadillac Eldorado (both built on GM's E-Body platform), also had hidden headlamps.  Revival  The 810/812 design was re-marketed almost immediately, in 1940, as ailing automakers Hupmobile and Graham-Paige tried to save money, and revive the companies, by using the same body dies. Except for their similarity to the 810, their 4-door sedans, the Hupp Skylark and the Graham Hollywood, were unremarkable. Retractable headlights gave way to plain headlight pods, and power came from a standard front-engine/rear-wheel drive design. Only about 1900 were built before production ceased in the fall of 1940. Between 1964 and 1970, two further attempts were made to replicate the original Buehrig design for limited production. Both Tulsa, Oklahoma-based companies soon halted production amid financial difficulties. The 1966 replica Cord 8/10 was powered by a Corvair drivetrain (the \\"8/10\\" designation represented the actual scale of the car), while the 1968 through 1970 models were Ford and Chrysler powered. The design of the Cord 810/812 remains one of the most distinctive of the 20th Century. In 1996, American Heritage magazine proclaimed the Cord 810 sedan ‘The Single Most Beautiful American Car’. The ‘Classic Cord’ Hot Wheels toy car of the 1960s, a convertible coupé, is one of the most valuable, and commands up to US$800 (2006) if still in an unopened package.

Seven people, including the shooter, were killed in the incident. The shooter was identified by police as 42-year-old Pedro Alberto Vargas, a resident of Hialeah, who, after setting his apartment ablaze, opened fire from his balcony and inside the apartment, then held two people hostage before being fatally shot by a SWAT team in the early hours of July 27. Events =Prior to the shooting= At 1:37 p.m., hours before the shooting started, Vargas called 9-1-1 and reported he was being followed, asking the dispatcher to run the license plate of a vehicle parked outside his apartment. He also claimed he was being threatened by people using witchcraft on him. His mother, 83-year- old Esperanza Patterson, then took the phone and told the dispatcher about her son's strange behavior. The dispatcher informed Patterson that police units have been sent to her residence, but Patterson advised against it, and later informed the dispatcher that Vargas had left, having gone to the office of a lawyer he hired for a recent legal matter. =The shooting= Glock 17 According to officials, Vargas poured combustible liquid on $10,000 in cash and set it on fire in his apartment unit at around 6:30 p.m. The Todel Apartments' manager, 79-year-old Italo Pisciotii, and his 69-year-old wife Samira noticed the smoke and ran to the apartment. Vargas stepped into the hallway and opened fire with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic pistol, killing both. He proceeded to go to his balcony on the fourth floor of the building and fired 10 to 20 bullets into the street, fatally hitting 33-year-old Carlos Gavilanes as he got out of his car. Vargas then kicked open the door of apartment 304, where he shot and killed the residents, 64-year-old Patricio Simono, his 51-year-old wife Merly Niebels, and their 17-year-old daughter Priscilla Perez; Police officers responded to the scene and exchanged gunfire with Vargas throughout the complex's stairwells for about five hours. Vargas then entered apartment 525, where he took the residents, Zoeb and Farida Nek, hostage for about three hours. During the standoff, he continued firing shots at officers outside. After negotiations reportedly broke down, authorities decided to send in a six-officer SWAT team to rescue the hostages. The team entered the building and found the two hostages praying in the living room, while Vargas was pacing around out of their view. Officers outside distracted Vargas with a stun grenade, allowing the SWAT team to rescue the hostages and open fire on Vargas, who they gunned down after a brief shootout. Both hostages escaped unharmed. Two fully loaded magazines were found at the scene. The event was the deadliest mass shooting in Hialeah's history, as well as the deadliest in the entire Miami area in three decades. Victims *Italo Pisciotti, 79 (building manager, killed in a hallway) *Samira Pisciotti, 69 (wife of Italo Pisciotii, killed in a hallway) *Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33 (killed on the street) *Patricio Simono, 64 (killed in apartment 304) *Merly S. Niebles, 51 (wife of Patricio Simono, killed in apartment 304) *Priscilla Perez, 17 (daughter of Patricio Simono and Merly Niebles, killed in apartment 304) The perpetrator Pedro Alberto Vargas (October 3, 1970 – July 27, 2013), a Cuban native, was identified as the shooter. He was born in Havana to teachers, and his father died in 1991 or 1992. Vargas studied at the University of Pedagogical Sciences between 1990 and 1994, graduating with a bachelor's degree in technical education. He and his mother Esperanza Patterson immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s after winning U.S. visa lotteries, and Vargas was naturalized in 2004. According to records, he resided in apartment 408 with Patterson since 1999 and had committed no serious criminal offenses. He took classes at Miami Dade College, graduating in 2004 with an associate degree in graphic design. Neighbors described Vargas as a quiet man who commonly got into arguments with his mother in their apartment. According to several LA Fitness customers, Vargas frequented the local gym and often lifted weights as a way to channel out pent-up anger. He also used steroids and expressed frustration at bad experiences with women. The Glock 9mm pistol used in the shooting was legally purchased by Vargas in 2010 from a local gun shop, and he had a concealed carry permit for it. =Professional problems= He worked at the media services department at Miami Dade College's North Campus starting in 2004, and although his initial performance evaluations judged him positively, they began noting a lack of social skills. Vargas was eventually forced to resign in 2008 after the school found he downloaded inappropriate files, including a computer hacking tutorial from The Anarchist Cookbook. Several months afterward, Miami Dade College received anonymous online threats that were traced to a public library in Hialeah, though Vargas was suspected of being the sender. Vargas later found employment at a Miami company as a graphic designer, but was fired after three months. Like Miami Dade College, the company later received anonymous threats and Vargas was suspected, but not confirmed as the sender. Prior to the shooting, Vargas had been working as a graphic design artist for Bullet Line, a promotional company, from May to October 2012. Recently, he had been seeing an attorney, Angel Castillo, Jr., regarding \\"abusive emails and text messages\\" that were being sent to Bullet Line, starting a week after Vargas's dismissal. He initially denied sending the messages but later admitted to being the sender after being informed by the lawyer that he was possibly committing perjury. On the day of the shooting, after making the 9-1-1 call, Vargas had gone to Castillo's office and demanded to see him, only to learn he was not there at the time. According to a relative of his mother, Vargas feared losing his money due to the case. Reaction Following the incident, Mayor Carlos Hernández responded, \\"I'm torn apart. We've never had something so complex as we had last night.... It's an extremely sad day in Hialeah.\\" In the wake of the shooting, some citizens of Hialeah took to Twitter to express their concerns about safety in the city. On July 28, 2013, Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that was formed in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, issued a statement about the shooting, saying, \\"Our hearts are broken.

A slippery sequence causes a faster ribosomal transfer which in turn can cause the reading ribosome to \\"slip.\\" This allows a tRNA to shift by 1 base (−1) after it has paired with its anticodon, changing the reading frame.

Logan Lagoon is located on Finders island History The lagoon area was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1968, with additional blocks of adjacent land added subsequently. In 1982 it was designated a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. In 1996 it was declared a Shorebird Network Site. Description Logan Lagoon is a coastal wetland complex at the south-eastern corner of Flinders Island, lying some 5 km east of the village of Lady Barron. It is isolated from the sea by a large sand bar which is infrequently breached by either high water levels in the lagoon or by rough seas eroding the bar. The water in the lagoon is generally 1–2 m deep and fluctuates with rainfall, occasionally drying out. The 75 km2 catchment of the lagoon is mainly agricultural land. =Flora= The eastern side of the lagoon has a dense coastal shrubland of coast wattle and coast tea-tree interspersed with grassy patches. Where the land is largely protected from bushfires there is a mixture of forest and scrub dominated by Smithton peppermint, tea-tree, silver banksia and Oyster Bay pine. Some manna gum occurs on dune ridges. In swampy areas there are thickets of coast paperbark. Around the lagoon margins are patches of golden speargrass, coastal tussock grassland, salt-tolerant herbs and samphire. =Fauna= In winter the lagoon is important as a nesting site for black swans, and in summer as a feeding and resting site for migratory waders, or shorebirds, especially double-banded plovers. Several waterfowl species use the site, including Cape Barren geese.

History In 1890, Bartolo Meliá moved from Majorca, Spain to Ponce to take an accounting job. Once he arrived to Puerto Rico, Meliá discovered that the owners of the business he was to take a job at were in jail.

Meliá imported many goods from Europe which established his reputation as a popular grocer in the city. Thanks to his success as a grocer, he expanded his store into a restaurant.

After ending the dispute between Lebus and Bydgauche, Tigre becomes Lebus's adviser, having passed a series of tests in doing so.

After demanding that Liza returns her powers, Baba Yaga briefly duels Tigre and Liza, but is overpowered and Tigre is separated from Liza. Tigre is soon found by the Muozinelian soldier Damad, who was summoned by Kureys to learn of his whereabouts, and the two befriend each other. Damad becomes suspicious of Tigre's true identity and they return to Lebus before Elen and her allies reunite with Tigre.

As a young girl named Figneria Alshavin is appointed the new war maiden of Legnica, Tigre convinces Asvarre to help repel the Sachstein invasion. The Moonlight Knights, traveling to Nice, are ambushed by Greast, who captures Elen. In Muozinel, Mila senses that Elen is in danger and travels to Brune to help Tigre rescue Elen from Greast's torture. Tigre and his allies reunite with the Moonlight Knights to defeat Greast, who is eventually killed. Tigre and Elen profess their love, and Tigre and his allies help stop the Muozinel invasion. Production Lord Marksman and Vanadis entered development after author Tsukasa Kawaguchi accepted an offer by the MF Bunko J editorial department to write a fantasy novel for them.Afterword of the first light novel volume Kawaguchi contributed the concept of a young male archer and a female fighter who uses a sword as the protagonists, which the editorial department approved of. At the editorial department's suggestion, Kawaguchi included seven additional fighting girls and called them \\"war maidens\\". Kawaguchi wanted to have another weapon from a novel he had previously worked on for Tigre. The Monster Hunter video game franchise gave Kawaguchi the inspiration to develop Tigre's archery skills. Other influences for Tigre included historical archers such as Nasu no Yoichi and Robin Hood. Kawaguchi came up with the catch phrases \\"Strongest Bishōjo Fantasy\\" as well as the \\"Bishōjo Battle Fantasy\\" during the early part of development.Afterword of the second light novel volume When Kawaguchi was planning the second arc, he wanted to set the second arc in three years time. However, his editor requested that it should be set six months after the first arc.Afterword of the sixth light novel volume According to Kawaguchi, he was influenced by Record of Lodoss War, Fortune Quest as well as foreign and domestic light novels. He also based the five main kingdoms on European countries, such as France for Brune, Russia for Zhcted, Persia for Muozinel, Germany for Sachstein and the United Kingdom for Asvarre.

The brand was established in 2007 as a subsidiary of a Singaporean lifestyle company, The Wellness Group - from which the acronym, TWG, was derived. History TWG Tea was established in 2007 as a subsidiary of a Singaporean company, The Wellness Group. The Wellness Group's founder, Manoj M Murjani, a Hong Konger of Indian descent, conceptualised the luxury teahouse chain together with a French-Moroccan tea sommelier, Taha Bou Qdib. The company opened its first tea outlet in Raffles Place's Republic Plaza. In 2008, during its first year of operations, TWG Tea products were sold at Dean & Deluca, in New York. In 2010 the brand opened its first overseas store in Jiyūgaoka, Tokyo. Within a span of six years, TWG Tea has opened salons and boutiques in 14 countries. As of 2014, TWG Tea had distributors or outlets in Singapore, Russia, Japan, Morocco, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, India and Australia. In 2014, TWG Tea opened a training facility at its headquarters in Singapore to train its staff to become tea sommeliers. In the same year, following a legal dispute between Murjani and Bou Qdib over TWG's ownership, Murjani and The Wellness Group exited the brand, and the brand passed into the ownership of The Wellbeing Group, a second parent company established by Bou Qdib with acronymic similarities. Branding TWG Tea Salon & Boutique, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Branded as the \\"first and only upscale tea salon\\" in Singapore, TWG Tea sells tea, as well as tea-infused food, such as savoury items, pastries and desserts. It also sells upscale tea accessories, such as gold and platinum teacups. TWG Tea products are sold through the company's outlets as well as in upscale retailers such as Harrods Knightsbridge, Feinkost Kafer and El Corte Ingles. TWG Tea sells over 800 different tea varieties from every tea producing country in the world. In Hong Kong, TWG stores is called Tea WG (all TWG products sold in Hong Kong is also branded as Tea WG), due to trademark dispute with Tsit Wing Group. https://teawg.com/ Tea =Classification and packaging= TWG Tea presents their teas classified by colour: red, white, yellow, green, blue and black. The company sells 800 different kinds of tea sourced from different parts of the world and packaged under names such as \\"White House Tea\\" and \\"Singapore Breakfast Tea\\". Its most expensive tea, Gold Yin Zhen is sold for NT$250,000 per kilogram. =Cuisine= The tea-related cuisine sold by TWG Tea follows the same menu at all outlets. The menu contains both afternoon tea sets and other dining options. In addition to tea, outlets also sell other beverages, including alcohol. Lawsuit =Naming lawsuit= In 2011, a lawsuit against TWG Tea was filed in Hong Kong by tea retailer Tsit Wing International and its parent company Tsit Wing, for incorporating the abbreviation TWG in its name, which was trademarked by Tsit Wing. The latter company, which is based in Hong Kong, was founded in 1932. A judge handling the lawsuit noted in July 2013 that the use of the \\"existence of the date 1837 in TWG Tea's sign has led people to believe that the company was established at that time\\", while in actuality it was founded much later, in 2008. In justification, the firm's spokespeople claimed that it was instead a tribute to the \\"year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore\\". The case was ruled in Tsit Wing's favour, with damages payable yet to be decided. Shortly after the ruling, TWG Tea filed for appeal. On 3 December 2014, TWG Tea lost a court appeal and as a result it may have to change its name in Hong Kong. TWG Tea has room to pursue its final appeal. According to the company's lawyer, in case the company loses the appeal again, it may use another registered logo containing the acronym \\"TW\\" instead of the currently used \\"TWG\\", to which Tsit Wing had no objection. In January 2016, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled in Tsit Wing’s favour. =Shareholding lawsuit= A second lawsuit was launched against the company on 17 February 2014 by one of the company's co-founders, Manoj M Murjani, who claimed his ownership in the company had been unlawfully diluted by OSIM Group, and as a result was in breach of shareholding agreement previously signed. The trial was completed in 2016 and Murjani's claim was dismissed.

The company designs and sells a Linux operating system for industry standard network switches to deliver networking solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, and enterprise environments. Background Cumulus Networks was founded by JR Rivers and Nolan Leake in 2010. The company raised a first round of seed funding in 2012. Cumulus Networks emerged publicly in June 2013 after previously operating in stealth mode. The company is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Battery Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Peter Wagner and 4 of the 5 original VMware founders. In 2014 Dell made a deal with Cumulus to offer the option of the Cumulus Linux network OS with their switches. In 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise made a deal with Cumulus Networks to offer Cumulus Linux on their Altoline switches. In 2016, Mellanox made a deal with Cumulus Networks to offer Cumulus Linux on their Spectrum switches. In 2018, Lenovo made a deal with Cumulus networks to offer Cumulus Linux on their ThinkSystem Rackswitch line of switches. On June 20, 2019, the company announced the departure of co-founder JR Rivers, who had been the original CEO and, since March 2016, the CTO. According to the company's website, neither Rivers nor Leake remain on the Board of Directors. On May 4, 2020, Nvidia Corporation announced plans to acquire Cumulus Networks for an undisclosed amount.  Products  = Cumulus Linux = Cumulus Linux is an open source Linux based networking operating system for bare metal switches. It is based on Debian. In a 2017 Gartner report Cumulus Networks was highlighted as a pioneer of open source networking. Gartner drew attention to the fact that Cumulus Networks had developed an open source networking operating system in a market where hardware vendors delivered proprietary operating systems pre-installed. According to Gartner, Cumulus Networks had worked around the lack of vendor support for open source networking by deploying bare metal switches with the Cumulus Linux operating system in large corporate networks. 32 percent of the Fortune 50 companies used the Cumulus Linux operating system in their data centers in 2017. = NetQ = NetQ is a fabric-wide telemetry-based validation system that enables organizations to validate network state, both during regular operations and for post-mortem diagnostic analysis. = Host Pack = Host Pack includes software essentials that brings the host to the network through NetQ and FRRouting. Host Pack focuses on trying to enhance network visibility through NetQ’s end-to-end fabric validation, and on trying to promote network connectivity through FRRouting’s open source routing protocol. It enables the host to be part of the layer 3 network, while supporting layer 2 overlay networks.  Open source projects  = Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) = In 2012 Cumulus initiated the open network install environment project. The Open Compute Project turned ONIE into an initiative to define an open source install environment for bare metal network switches. A network switch with a ONIE install environment gives data centers the choice of network operating system. Therefore ONIE allows for a business model where networking hardware is disaggregated from the operating system. The Cumulus Linux operating system can be installed on all ONIE compliant switches, such as the Lenovo ThinkSystem RackSwitch series.

Stanley Moss, a British soldier, writer and traveller, best known, together with Patrick Leigh Fermor, for the Kidnap of General Kreipe as described in Moss’s book Ill Met by Moonlight. Moss recounts his subsequent activities during World War II as agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Crete, Macedonia (Greece) and Siam (Thailand). The 2014 editions contain an Introduction by one of Moss's children and a short biography, Billy Moss: Soldier, Writer, Traveller - A Brief Life by Alan Ogden as an Afterword. Summary In May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local resistance in harrying German occupying forces. Crete After the Kreipe Abduction, Moss returned to Crete on 6 July 1944. On the main road connecting Rethymno and Heraklion, he led a resistance group consisting of eight Cretans and six escaped Russian POW soldiers in an ambush on German forces intent on attacking Anogeia. He chose an ambush site by a bridge in the Damastos location, one kilometre west of the village of Damasta. After the team destroyed various passing vehicles, among which was a lorry carrying military mail to Chania, the German force on its way to target Anogia finally appeared. It consisted of a truck of infantrymen backed up by an armoured car. Moss and his group attacked the troops. Moss crawled up to the back of the armoured car and dropped a grenade into the hatch. In total, 40 to 50 Germans were killed in the clash that followed and one Russian partisan. He left Crete on 18 August 1944. Macedonia Moss served in Macedonia between September and November 1944, being promoted to Major on 24 October. He was sent to join Major Ken Scott in an operation to blow up the railway bridge over the Aliakmon River in order to disrupt German troop movements in and out of Thessaloniki. After heavy rain, the river burst its banks preventing Moss from a final attempt to blow up a section of the bridge. He continued to undertake sabotage operations to hinder the German withdrawal.Ogden, Alan, Sons of Odysseus, SOE Heroes in Greece, Bene Factum Publishing Ltd, London, 2012, .

After he misappropriated $11,500 from Mall Finance, Slater entered into an agreement with the company to repay the stolen money, if the company agreed not to report the matter to the police. To secure the agreement, Slater had to give a mortgage over her house at 60 Penrose Street, Lower Hutt. Later, Slater had a change of heart (and perhaps a change of boyfriend) and applied to the High Court to set aside the mortgage because it was illegal at common law, being it was a contract entered into for the purpose of not to disclose a crime. The High Court set aside the mortgage, as section 7(3) of the Illegal Contracts Act prohibits the courts from granting any such relief to Mall Finance. Mall Finance appealed. Decision The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court’s ruling, but on the technicality that the High Court should have referred the matter to a full hearing. However the end effect is that any contract obtained to prevent someone not to report a criminal act, will not be legally enforceable.

The length of the forewing is 18–20 mm. =Genitalia= Male Following are the characteristics of the male genitalia: * Saccus is fairly short. * Gnathos with the medial component is tongue-shaped, downcurved and without denticles. * Lateral angles is with denticles. * Valva is broad medially, narrows to finger-like projection. Female The female genitalia has the following features: * Anal papillae is fairly pointed. * Ductus bursae broadens gradually into corpus bursae. * Signum is denticulate. =Antenna= The antenna is not bipectinate in both sexes. Diagnosis M. coscoja is similar to M. albistria, M. bahiata, M. uniformis, and M. amaculata. The presence of the narrow postmedial streak distinguishes M. coscoja from these species, as does the shape of the Gnathos and Valva.

Background Eileen Jessup, a nurse in her 60s, owned a house on Great North Road in Auckland, that had a full street frontage. Paul Nichols, a manager of a real estate agency in Australia, owned the house on the back section, and its sole access was a 3.66 meter easement over Nichols property. This means of access was deemed to be unsatisfactory to Nichols. To rectify this Nichols proposed to Jessup that they amalgamate both their respective driveways, which would improve the value of the back property by $45,000 due to the fact that the improved access would let Nichols to build up to 12 flats on that property, and reduce the value of front property by $3,000 as the widened driveway would now come up to inches of the side of her house. For reasons not stated, Jessup agreed to this, although later at trial Jessup was referred to by the judge as “unintelligent and muddle-headed” and “ignorant about property matters”. Matters come to a head when Nichol's solicitors noticed that Jessup had signed the agreement under her maiden name, and they resent the contract to her to be signed under her married name, for which she refused to do. Later Jessup, presumably unhappy at the one sided agreement, applied to the courts to have the whole agreement set aside. Decision The Court of Appeal of New Zealand ruled that as Nichol’s was a real estate agent, that they ought to of known of the substantial imbalance. Cooke P stated As a footnote, this decision was just made after the Privy Council had made the ruling in O'Connor v Hart which also involved unconscionable bargains, and which reversed a previous ruling of McMullins J, who was a judge at this trial.

Zaga Christ travelled extensively, living in Sudan, Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and later Italy. There he met the Pope and fell in love with the franciscan nun Caterina Massimi, who he corresponded with from the years of 1633 to 1637 with letters of love written in their own blood. Zaga Christ died the following year of pleurisy while in France, where the letters were later discovered. Accounts of his story There are many accounts of his life story. The French Franciscan friar Eugène Roger met Zaga Christ in Nazareth (then part of Ottoman Empire) and was familiar with his whereabouts from there until his death.F. Eugene Roger, La Terre Sainte, ou, Description topographique tres-particuliere des Saints Lieux, & de la Terre de Promission, Paris: Antoine Bertier, 1664 Rèchac's accounts came from an Italian manuscript, written by Zaga Christ himself when he was living in Rome. The Catholic Patriarch of Ethiopia, Afonso Mendes, devoted a letter in 1638 to disputing his claims of royal birth. Early Age Depending on the author, Zaga Christ was born between 1610 and 1614. While he claimed King Yaˁəqob I as his father, it is unlikely as King Yaˁəqob I was killed in 1606 by Susenyos. He was Christian. His mother was named Nazarena. He had a brother named Cosme; together they were educated in the town of Aich on the island of Maroűe. He claimed, in 1629, when he alleges his father was killed, that his mother ordered the brothers to split some gold and jewelry between them and flee. Cosme allegedly went south to Monomotapa, ruled by an enemy of Ethiopia, and ultimately to the Cape of Good Hope. Zaga Christ himself went north to the Sennar Kingdom, where he was received in the court of King Orbat. After a falling out with King Orbat over Zaga marrying his daughter, and the threat of death from Susenyos, Zaga left for Cairo. He later left Cairo and arrived in Jerusalem during Lent of 1632, where he was seen by Roger. For security reasons, he then left for Nazareth. He was received into the Catholic Church by Father Paul de Lande, then Guardian of Jerusalem. In Europe From September 1632 until October 1634, he lived in Rome. During that time, he met with Catholic church officials in hopes of setting up a mission in Ethiopia and hopefully reclaim the throne. While many memorandums were written, no final decision was made, due to tensions between various groups in the church and European countries. The original goal after he left was to go to England, but that fell through, and only made it to Turin, then to Paris in early 1635. There, he announced he wasn't going back to Ethiopia, but would stay there. He ordered his servant, Ignazio, to return home, but he died on the way. Zaga was supported by French Royalty while he lived in Paris. Zaga died of pleurisy on April 22, 1638. He was buried next to a prince of Portugal. He was buried at Rueil with the epitaph (translated from French) \\"Here lies the king of Ethiopia\\\\ The original or the copy.\\"  References  Category:17th-century Ethiopian people Category:History of Ethiopia ","title":"Zaga Christ"},{"id":"40091536","text":"The William Wrigley Jr. Summer Cottage, or \\"Mount Ada\\", is a historic residence located at 76 Wrigley Road in Avalon, on Santa Catalina Island, California.

PANTHER is part of the Gene Ontology Reference Genome Project designed to classify proteins and their genes for high-throughput analysis. The project consists of both manual curation and bioinformatics algorithms. Proteins are classified according to family (and subfamily), molecular function, biological process and pathway. It is one of the databases feeding into the European Bioinformatics Institute's InterPro database.—Application of PANTHER—The most important application of PANTHER is to accurately infer the function of uncharacterized genes from any organism based on their evolutionary relationships to genes with known functions. By combining gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools, PANTHER enables biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data obtained from the current advance technology including: sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments. Shortly, using the data and tools on the PANTHER, users will be able to: * Obtain information about a particular gene of interest. * Discover protein families and subfamilies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. * Create lists of genes related to a particular protein family/subfamily, molecular function, biological process or pathway. * Analyze lists of genes, proteins or transcripts.

Phylogenetic tree  In panther there is a pythogenetic tree for each of the protein families. The annotation of tree is done based on the following criteria: * Each node is annotated by gene attributes including “subfamily membership”, “protein class”, “gene function”. These attributes are heritable. Swiss-Prot protein names are usually used to name subfamilies. Since PANTHER is part of the GO reference genome project, the Gene Ontology (GO) terms are used for gene function. PANTHER/X ontology terms are used for protein class. * Each internal node is annotated by evolutionary events such as “speciation”, “gene duplication” and “horizontal gene transfer”. To generate phylogenetic trees, PANTHER uses GIGA algorithm. GIGA uses species tree to develop tree construction. On every iteration it attempts to reconcile tree in event form of speciation and gene duplication.  PANTHER library data generation process The process for data generation is divided into three steps: # Family Clustering # Pythologentic Tree Building # Annotation of Tree Nodes = Family clustering =  Sequence set  PANTHER trees depicts gene family evolution from a broad selection of genomes which are fully sequenced. PANTHER have one sequence per gene so that the tree can represent event occurred over the course of evolution i.e duplication, speciation. PANTHER genomes set are selected based on the following criteria: * The set should include a major experimental model organism, this will assist in depicting functional information of the organism which are less studied. * The set should include a broad taxonomic range of other genomes, preferably fully sequenced and annotated, this will assist in relating experimental model organism.  Family clusters  Following are the requirements for being family clusters in PANTHER: #The family must contain at least five members among which at least one gene has to be from a GO reference genome. #In order to support phylogenetic inference, the family must contain a high quality sequence alignment. #The assessment of multiple aligned sequence is done by assessing a length of the aligned sequence, at least 30 sites aligned across 75% or more of family members. = Phylogenetic tree building = For each family multiple sequence are aligned using a default setting of MAFFT, any column which is aligned less than 75% of the sequence is removed. This data is then used as an input for GIGA program. The output tree from GIGA are labelled. Each internal node is labelled as whether divergence event happened as speciation or gene duplication. = Annotation of tree nodes = Each node in PANTHER tree is annotated with heritable attribute. Heritable attribute can be of three types subfamily membership, gene function and protein class membership. These annotation of nodes applies to primary sequence which was used to construct tree. In applying these annotation to primary sequence simple evolutionary principle is used i.e. each node annotation is propagated by its decedent node.  PANTHER components  PANTHER/LIB (PANTHER library): Library consists of collection of books. Each of these books represents a protein family. There are a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and a family tree for each protein family in the library. PANTHER/X (PANTEHR index): Index contains abbreviated ontology which assist in summarizing, navigating molecular function and biological function. Although PANTHER/X ontology has a hierarchical organization, it is a directed acyclic graph and so when it is biologically justified, child categories appear under more than one parent. PANTHER/X has been mapped to GO and arranged in a different way to facilitate large scale analysis of proteins.  PANTHER Pathways  PANTHER includes 176 pathway using CellDesigner tool. PANTHER pathways can be downloaded in the following file formats. * Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) * Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN - ML) * BioPAX  Recent versions of PANTHER and their statistics and updates  = Version 6.0 = Version 6 uses UniProt sequences as training sequences. There are 19132 UniProt training sequences directly associated with the pathway components. This version has ~1500 reactions in 130 pathways, and the number of pathways associated with subfamilies were expanded. PANTHER became a member of the InterPro Consortium. The availability of PANTHER data was improved (the HMMs can be downloaded by FTP). The PANTHER/LIB version 6.1 contains 221609 UniProt sequences from 53 organisms, grouped into 5546 families and 24561 subfamilies. (2006) = Version 7.0= In this version the phylogenetic trees represent speciation and gene duplication events. Identification of gene orthologs is possible. There are more support for alternative database identifiers for genes, proteins and microarray probes. PANTHER version 7 uses the SBGN standard to depict biological pathways. It includes 48 set of genomes. To define the new families and in collaboration with the European Bioinformatics Institute’s InterPro group, approximately 1000 families of non-animal genomes were added in this version. The sources of gene sets included model organism databases, Ensembl genome annotation and Entrez Gene. Since this version, a stable identifier to each node in the tree is used. This stable identifier is a nine-digit number with the prefix PTN (stand for PANTHER Tree Node). (2009) = Version 8.0 (2012) = The reference proteome set maintained by the UniProt resource is used in this version of PANTHER and so the source of gene sets is UniProt. It includes 82 set of genomes (approximately double compared with version 7) and 991985 protein coding genes from which 642319 genes (64.75%) have been used for family clusters. PANTHER website is redesigned to facilitate common user workflow. = Version 9.0 (2014)= This version contains 7180 protein families, divided into 52,768 functionally distinct protein subfamilies. Version 9.0 has genomes of all 85 organisms.Details in PANTHER 9 statistics can be found here (http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/summaryStats.jsp) = Version 11.1 (2016) = This version contains 78442 subfamilies and 1,064,054 genes annotated.  PANTHER website  The home page of PANTHER website shows several folder tabs for major workflows, including: gene list analysis, browse, sequence search, cSNP scoring, and keyword search. The details about each of these workflow are provided below. =Gene list analysis= This tab is selected by default because this the most frequently used option. You can enter valid IDs in the box or upload a file, then select list type, choose organism of interest and select the type of analysis. A practical example: Let's try this workflow using an example of a small gene list containing three genes AKT1, AKT2, AKT3. We first type these gene names within the box and separate them by comma (or space). We select \\"ID list\\" as list type, \\"Homo Sapiens\\" (human) as organism, and \\" Functional classification viewed in gene list\\" as the type of operation; then click submit. It gives you the information for all the three genes which are: # Gene IDs from Ensembl and protein IDs from Uniprot: in terms of this example, you must see \\"ENSG00000142208\\" and \\"P31749\\". # Mapped IDs: these are simply the names of the genes which have been mapped to your query (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) # Gene names, gene symbols, and the orthologs: the orthologs are clickable and by clicking on them you can see the list of other organisms and their IDs as well as the type of orthologs (\\"LDO\\" for least diverged ortholog, \\"O\\" for other which are more diverged orthologs, and \\"P\\" for paralogs). # PANTHER family and subfamily: This will give you the name of family and subfamily for your genes. There are some links, e.g. a link to the family tree, which is clickable. Finally you will have the genes from different species assigned to that subfamily. In this example you have the PANTHER subfamily \\"PTHR24352:SF30\\" for AKT1. # GO molecular function: This tell you what are the functions of your query gene; e.g. AKT1 has protein kinase activity and can selectively and non- covalently interact with calcium ions, calmodulin, and phospholipids. # GO biological process: By looking at this column, you will understand what biological processes the gene involved in; e.g. AKT1 has role in gamete generation, apoptosis, cell cycle, etc. # GO cellular component: It tells you where in the cell you can find your query protein. In our example, the information is not available but if you try another examples (such as the gene p53), you will see some cellular components such as \\"nucleus\\", \\"cytoplasm\\", \\"chromosomes\\", etc. # PANTHER protein class: this gives you the names and IDs of PANTHER protein class for each of the genes; e.g. AKT1 is under PANTHER protein class \\"non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinase\\" with class ID \\"PC00167\\". You can also see its parent and child lineage. # Pathways: A list of clickable names of the pathways in which your query gene exists will be shown; e.g. AKT1 is involved in several pathways such as \\"Hypoxia response via HIF\\", \\"Apoptosis signaling pathway\\", \\"PI3 kinase pathway\\", etc. # Species: This is the name of species you have chosen; in this case we chose \\"Homo sapiens\\". =Browse= Using this folder tab and by selecting the ontology you are interested in, you can browse different classification. It is also possible to select more than one ontology; in this case, the results will meet the criteria from all the selections. You are able to see the association between ontology terms and PANTHER families, subfamilies and training sequences. =Sequence search= By putting the protein sequence in the Sequence Search box, PANTHER will search against a library of family and subfamily HMMs, and return the subfamily that best matches the sequence. If you click on the subfamily name, it will give some details, e.g. the genes related to that subfamily and the ability to view the subfamily within larger family tree. By downloading the PANTHER scoring tool from download page, you will be able to score many sequences against PANTHER HMMs. =cSNP scoring= Using this folder tab, you are able to do evolution analysis of coding SNPs. You must enter a protein sequence in the first box and the substitutions relative to this protein sequence in the second box; this substitutions should be entered in the standard amino acid substitution format, e.g. L46P. PANTHER will use an alignment of evolutionarily related proteins, calculate the substitution position-specific evolutionary conservation (subPSEC) and estimate the likelihood of this nonsynonymous coding SNP to lead a functional effect on the protein. This tool uses data from PANTHER version 6.1 for technical reasons. One of the new features of PANTHER is that if you want to analyze a lot of SNPs, you can go to the download page and download the PANTHER Coding Snp Analysis tool. =Keyword search= Entering a search term in the keyword search box, PANTHER will give you the number of records matching your keyword for genes, families, pathways and ontology terms. You can filter them by determining the species of interest or by refining the search using other criteria. To view the details of the gene, you must click on the gene identifier.

He made his debut in minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire against Buckinghamshire in the 1935 Minor Counties Championship. He played minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire from 1935 to 1939, making thirty appearances. It was in 1936 he made his debut in first-class cricket, having been selected for a combined Minor Counties cricket team against the touring Indians at Lord's. In a match which the Indians won by an innings and 74 runs, Winlaw scored 13 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings before he was dismissed by Amar Singh, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for a duck by Mohammad Nissar. His brother Roger Winlaw was also a first-class cricketer. Schoolteacher Winlaw taught at Aldenham School and Shrewsbury School, then served during World War II in the Intelligence Corps. After the war he taught at several schools in various countries. For his service as headmaster of the Government Cadet College at Hasan Abdal, Pakistan, he was appointed OBE.

The boat was laid down as the Dutch submarine K XXV and renamed O 25 but was captured during the German invasion of the Netherlands in World War II and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine. Ship history The submarine was ordered on 28 June 1938 and laid down on 10 April 1939 as K XXV at the Wilton-Fijenoord, Rotterdam. During construction she was renamed O 25, and was finally launched on 1 May 1940. Following the German invasion of 10 May 1940, O 25 was scuttled in the Nieuwe Waterweg near Rotterdam because there was no tugboat available to tow her to the United Kingdom. The boat was raised by the Germans and it was decided to repair and complete her. She served in the Kriegsmarine as UD-3 and was commissioned on 8 June 1941. From June to July 1941 UD-3 served as a trial boat in Kiel while attached to the 3rd Flotilla. In June she was transferred to the 5th Flotilla also in Kiel where she was used as a school boat. She remained there until August that year. From August 1941 until September 1942 the boat was stationed at Lorient in occupied France and attached to the 2nd Flotilla. In October 1942 she was transferred to 10th Flotilla also in Lorient where she served until February 1943. When patrolling off the west coast of Africa UD-3 spotted and sank the Norwegian freighter Indra on 26 November 1942. In March 1943 the boat was transferred to Bergen in occupied Norway and attached to the U-boot Abwehr Schule to be used as school boat until October 1944. 13 October 1944 UD-3 was decommissioned after being damaged in an air raid on Kiel. On 3 May 1945 the boat was scuttled.

The history of clothing in India dates back to ancient times, yet fashion is a new industry, as it was the traditional Indian clothing with regional variations, be it the sari, ghagra choli or dhoti, that remained popular until the early decades of post-independence India. A common form of Indian fashion originates from Western culture. Fashion includes a series of sequins and gold thread to attract customers and apply a statement to the Indian fashion community. A famous Indian fashion trademark is embroidery, an art of sewing distinct thread patterns. A way to include the traditional look and create a new fashion statement includes embroidery applied to different dresses, skirts, shirts, and pants to reflect the western culture influence as well as include the Indian tradition. As part of larger revival movement in the Indian textile industry, Ritu Kumar, a Kolkata-based designer and textile print- expert started working on reviving the traditional hand block printing techniques of Bengal, and making it a part of the fashion industry, established \\"ethnic chic\\". She opened her first boutique in Delhi in 1966. In 1973, she first showcased the Zardozi embroidery in her garments, which had its origins in the royal costumes dating back to the Mughal era. This led to the revival of this lost art. In time embroidery became a prominent feature of Indian wedding attire, and also one of the country's biggest fashion exports. This was a period of revival, where various organisations, NGOs and indicuals were involved in reviving traditional Indian techniques, in weaving, printing, dyeing or embroidery, including ikat, patola (double-ikat), bandhani (tie-dye) and shisha (mirror embroidery). An early trendsetter in fashion was Bollywood (Hindi cinema), where costume designers like Bhanu Athaiya started experimenting with film fashion in the 1960s. Athaiya started working on period costumes in Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962) and Amrapali (1966), though she went on to introduce varied trends through Teesri Manzil (1966), Chalte Chalte (1976), Karz (1980) and Chandni (1989). These were soon followed by the mass market. Also situations and themes in Indian cinema became westernised, making way for the display of diverse fashion. Over the years, popular Bollywood trends have been the Madhubala's Anarkali-look with kurtas and churidars in Mughal-e-Azam (1960), purple embroidered sari worn by Madhuri Dixit in Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! (1994), to Rani Mukherji's short kurti-suits in Bunty Aur Babli (2005), Veer Zaara suits and blouses from Parineeta. This comes besides various fashion interpretations of the sari in films like Chandni (1989) with Sridevi, Main Hoon Naa (2004) with Sushmita Sen and Dostana (2008) with Priyanka Chopra, which became fashion trends. However, in recent decades, with increasing exposure to the West, its influence is no longer as strong as in previous decades. By the 2000s, with rise in the Indian diaspora around the world and the non-resident Indians, Bollywood continues to exert far greater influence on the fashion sensibilities amongst Indians around the world. Floor-length Anarkali- style \\"churidaar-kurta\\" worn by actress Priyanka Chopra =1980s and fashion boom= By the early 1980s, the first generation of Indian fashion designers started cropping up, including Satya Paul. However, it was Rohit Khosla (1958–1994) who became a pioneer in the fashion industry, when he co-founded Ensemble\\" in 1987, with Tarun Tahiliani, Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla and others. Though the \\"Anarkali-style\\" has been around ever since, it was first popularised after Mughal-e-Azam (1969). It was Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, who inspired by costumes of Mughal courtesans and Meena Kumari's costumes in Pakeezah (1975), introduced the floor-length Anarkali-style of churidaar-kurta in 1988, which soon became the Indian version of the ball gown. In 1986, the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India opened the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Delhi with the help of the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York. It played an important role in bringing in locally trained fashion designers.New Fashion School in India Draws From a Rich Heritage, by Barbara Crossette, New York Times, June 21, 1989. By 2010, it had developed 15 branches across India, and smaller private fashion institutions had also developed.Linda, p. 553 Also in 1987, Tarun Tahiliani and his wife Shailja 'Sal' Tahiliani, founded Ensemble, India's first multi-designer boutique in Mumbai. In 1990, economic liberalisation of the Indian economy took place, which also propelled the fashion industry.Linda, p. 551 In the following decade, fashion industry experienced a boom, both in terms of volume and trends. Designer Suneet Varma, inspired by his corsetry- raining in France, introduced an indo-western, metal breast plate, followed by the \\"corset blouse\\" in 1992, made with satin, polyester taffeta or stretch lace. It was designed to replace the traditional choli, or Indian blouse worn with a sari. In its early years, the 1980s, Indian design largely focused on haute couture; however, in the next decade, India saw a growth in the domestic retail industry, as well as an influx of outsourced garment business from the western countries. This meant better quality and larger manufacturing facilities available locally. Together, these reasons spurred many Indian designers to start their prêt-à-porter (ready-to- wear) lines.Linda, p. 555 Low-cut choli have become a fashion trend, driven by Bollywood's fashion designers like Manish Malhotra An Indian model at Formula 1 promotion. \\"God-printed T-shirts\\" were introduced by Manish Arora in 1997, along with Indian kitsch and street art in saturated colors on fashionwear. Another important reinvention was made in 1998 by Monisha Jaisingh, who shortened the traditional kurta to develop the Kurti, which became popular worldwide as the \\"Indian embroidered tunic\\". Also in the same year, the Fashion Design Council of India was established, which later started the India Fashion Week in Delhi, to promote Indian designers and manufacturers. In 2000, another Bollywood costume designer, Manish Malhotra, became an important influence on Indian fashion. Having designed the trendy looks for actresses Urmila Matondkar in Rangeela (1995) and Karisma Kapoor in Raja Hindustani (1996), he introduced the \\"cocktail sari\\" in 2000. Using pastel colors, and fabrics like chiffon, satin or net, it revived the traditional sari in a modern avatar. He was in turn inspired by the popular Bollywood saris of the 1960s and the chiffon saris worn by the actress in Yash Chopra films, like Chandni (1989). This also started another era of Bollywood fashion influence and its collaboration with leading designers, besides leading actors and actresses occasionally walking the ramp for some designers. By 2009, the Indian fashion industry, despite the ongoing recession, was worth . Also in the same year, Manish Arora, known for his quirky-kitsch, became the first Indian designer to participate in Paris Fashion Week. =2010 onwards - Change in Indian Menswear fashion= Lakme Fashion Week's Gen Next programme has been helpful in giving a launch platforms for some of the newest and avant garde designers in this country. Fashion designers such as Antar Agni, Mr. Ajay Kumar, Bloni are the some of the newest designers on the block. Mr. Ajay Kumar is one such designer who has revolutionised the way Indian men perceive fashion - introducing the signature print-on-print look for men. He has brought colourful prints for men and with the likes of celebrities such as Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor popularising such looks, men in India have become more experimental and flamboyant in their outlook. Antar Agni has introduced draped menswear which is quite popular amongst the new age men who want to experiment with silhouettes. Cities Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai are important centers of fashion designing and manufacture in India, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and other large cities. Mumbai and Bangalore are the home of some of the top fashion rental services in India.

Academic research on Indian fashion  The Indian fashion industry as such remains academically understudied, even though there is research available on textiles, craft traditions and history of Indian dress. The only anthropological study of the Indian fashion industry, based on ethnographic research in Northern India, specifically New Delhi and Lucknow and dealing with both the worlds of luxury fashion designers and the worlds of craftspeople and workers in the industry, is Tereza Kuldova's seminal work Luxury Indian Fashion: A Social Critique, published by Bloomsbury in 2016.

Plot The story was set in the 1990s. Secondary school student, Jiaming (Daren Tan) was coping with both his O-level examinations and his parents' bar business, the Dream Boat. He and his mates Cao Gen (Seah Jiaqing), Hao Ban (Kenny Khoo) and Xiao Pang (Kelvin Mun) were studying. When a dare to get the numbers of two nearby girls, Jayley and Hayley Woo, went awry, the boys ran away. Jiaming bumped into the twins' friend, May (Julie Tan), while doing so, consequently dropping his Xinyao booklet. After receiving their O-Level results, Jiaming decided to drop out of school, having already retained for two years, while the rest of the boys moved on. Coincidentally, they were placed in the same Junior College as the three girls they had met earlier. On the first day of school, the boys started a short-lived pornographic magazines business and were suspended from school for a month's time. Meanwhile, Jiaming visited the junior college to hang out with his friends and was attracted by a familiar music tune into an empty school assembly hall. There, he discovered May playing the song on the piano from the Xinyao book that he dropped earlier. He confronted her to repossess his book but was interrupted by three school bullies, whose leader said that May was his. Jiaming left the scene after a conflict with the bullies. Eventually, he met up with his three friends and learned about their suspension. The boys became aware of Xinyao singing contest with a winner's purse of $5000. Jiaming suggested that they form a band and join the contest. After their auditions, the boys bumped into the girls, who had also tried their luck in the contest but lost because of technical difficulties. They decided to work together with the boys, forming a collaborative band. Subsequently, they were asked to perform at and advertise Dream Boat. During a gig later on, Jiaming was hounded by a pack of bullies, headed by James (Xavier Ong), for his close relationship with May. They were eventually chased away and the performance goes on as per normal, until May unexpectedly collapsed because of a heart defect. May's mother banned her from seeing Jiaming after the incident but the warning was ignored and their relationship becomes stronger. They got romantically involved, as do the other guys and ladies. Xiao Pang receives Chinese tuition from his driver's daughter Liyana, and they become close. All is well until May announced that she was leaving for the United States. May skipped school during her birthday and was joined by the boys. Upon realising her daughter's truancy, May's mother detained her in the house and confronts Jiaming, harshly warning him to stop seeing May. Jiaming and his friends had been repeatedly calling her, but her mother refused her to pick up the phone. On the night before leaving for the United States, May ran in the rain to flag a taxi to get to Jiaming's house. Jiaming spent the next few hours with her, and sent her off at the airport together with his friends, as her mother handed her her backpack. Before May entered the departure gate, she whispered to her mother that going to United States to study would be the last time that she would ever listen to her. Jiaming visited May once in the United States with money pooled together by his friends, and after returning, he and his friends performed during the finals of the Xinyao competition. Months later, May died, and Jiaming, together with his friends, went to mourn her death. However, May's mother gave Jiaming a slap on his face, and drove them out. 18 years later, in the present day, Cao Gen sold cars while Hao Ban owned a kopitiam. Xiao Pang became a dentist and was blissfully married with Liyana and they have 2 sons. Jiaming went on to further his studies in English Literature and became a teacher. He also got married and named his first born, a girl, in memory of May. On the 18th death anniversary of May, Jiaming went to columbarium to offer flowers as his annual practices. There he met an American Chinese girl, Rachel Anderson (Naomi Yeo), who was born and stayed with her foster parents in United States. She identifies herself as May's daughter whom May gave birth to just before she died and she had come to Singapore to find out more about her mother. Jiaming began to tear during their conversation, realising that Rachel was the surprise (Their fruit of love after he visited her in US) May promised him during an overseas call just months before she died and that May's mother forbids him to mourn at May's funeral probably because he gotten her pregnant out of wed-lock with May's insistence to carry on with the pregnancy despite the toil it could take on her weak heart. May's mother subsequently gave Rachel away to foster parent adoption in the US. After hearing from Rachel that she was living well with her foster parents, Jiaming decides not to identify himself as her biological father or May's boyfriend, so as not to disrupt her lifestyle. Rachel invited Jiaming to her performance at a bar the next day, and Jiaming invited his old friends to watch her perform. On the day of the performance, Xiao Pang brought Liyana and his two sons along, and Rachel sang a rendition of \\"The Narrow Stream Flows For A Long Time\\".

It was a three bay triplane, the bays separated by parallel pairs of interplane struts. The fabric covered wings were unswept and had constant chord and blunt tips. The spans decreased a little from top to bottom plane, so the outer interplane struts leaned outwards; there was little stagger. There were externally connected ailerons on each plane. The Maybach Mb.IV six cylinder inline engines were mounted in the inner bay on the central plane, neatly and fully cowled. The fuselage of the G.III was round in section and smoothly covered in plywood. There was an open gunner's position in the blunt extreme nose.

Election Originally appointed by the Regional Council of Marche, since 1995 de facto and 2000 de jure, he is elected by popular vote every five years under universal suffrage: the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, is elected. His office is connected to the Regional Council, which is elected contextually: a majority bonus hugely increases the number of his supporters in the assembly. The Council and the President are linked by an alleged relationship of confidence: if the President resigns or he is dismissed by the Council, a snap election is called for both the legislative and the executive offices, because in no case the two bodies can be chosen separately. The popular election of the President and the relationship of confidence between him and the legislature, allow to identify the Lombard model of government as a particular form of semi-presidential system. Powers The President of Marche promulgates regional laws and regulations. He can receive special administrative functions by the national government. The President is one of the eighty members of the Regional Council and, in this capacity, he can propose new laws. The President appoints and dismiss the Regional Cabinet (called Giunta Regionale in Italian). The Cabinet is composed by no more than sixteen regional assessors (assessori, literally \\"aldermen\\"According to Google Translate) who can be members of the Council at the same time. Assessors should not be confused with the ministers: according to Italian administrative law, assessors only receive delegations from the President to rule a bureau or an agency, the Region being a single legal person, not divided in ministries. One assessor can be appointed Vice President. The President can also appoint four under-secretaries (sottosegretari) to help the President in his functions. The Regional Cabinet prepares the budget, appoints the boards of public regional agencies and companies, manages assets, develops projects of governance, and resorts to the Constitutional Court of Italy if it thinks that a national law may violate regional powers. The President and the Cabinet are two different authorities of the Region: in matters within its competence, the Cabinet has the power to vote to give its approval.

Directed by R Hu and produced by Ang Hock Liem, it starred A Bakar, Djoewariah, O Parma, Oedjang, RS Fatimah, Soelastri, and Zonder. The story centers on two families torn apart by finances and clashes of personality. The third film produced by Union Films, Bajar dengan Djiwa featured many actors who had previously appeared in the company's works. It was released by February 1941. Advertisements emphasised the realism of the story, and reviewers praised the film's acting, romance, and humour. Screenings continued until at least 1943, more than a year after Union was closed following the Japanese occupation.  Plot  Bajar dengan Djiwa follows the interactions of several groups of people. Husband and wife Basuki (Zonder) and Suryati (Nji Soelastri) clash because of their different personalities: the former is a thinker concerned with the state of society, while the latter only thinks of herself. Meanwhile, Umar (Oedjang) and Supini (RS Fatimah) clash over Umar's wasteful nature; eventually, he sinks so far into debt that he must sell his daughter, Djuliah (Djoewariah), to a loan shark named Asnan (O. Parma), a move which breaks the heart of Djuliah's boyfriend Ruhiyat (A Bakar). Other scenes include comic interactions between two servants, Icah (Ijem) and Djemblug (Komung).  Production  Bajar dengan Djiwa was directed by R Hu for Union Films. It was Hu's second film for the company; he had already completed one film for the company, Harta Berdarah (Bloody Treasure; 1941), in collaboration with Rd Ariffien. The film, Union's third, was produced by its head, Ang Hock Liem. The story was written by journalist Saeroen, who had joined Union with Harta Berdarah after previously finding success with Tan's Film. This black-and-white film starred A Bakar, Djoewariah, O Parma, Oedjang, RS Fatimah, Soelastri, and Zonder. It also included Itjang Ali, Haroen, Oesman, Komoeng, Ijem, and Moesa. Many of these actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, had been with Union since its first production, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask), in 1940. Others, including Moesa and Zonder, had made their debuts in Harta Berdarah.; Djoewariah, a stage actress and keroncong singer, was a new hire.  Release and reception  Bajar dengan Djiwa, produced in 1940, was released by February 1941. By July 1941 the film was being screened in Singapore, then part of British Malaya.; A novelisation of the film, written by Saeroen, was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning. In the East Indies, children under age 17 were prohibited from viewing. Advertisements, some which referred to the film with the Dutch title Met den Dood Betaald, emphasised the film's \\"realistic\\" depiction of a married life. A review in the Java Bode found that Bajar dengan Djiwa was one of the Best Malay films yet made, with \\"almost no stiffness and woodenness\\" in the acting. Another review, in the Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië, described the film as \\"striking proof\\" of Saeroen's knowledge of indigenous society and praised the film's romance and humour.  Legacy  After Bajar Dengan Djiwa, Union produced a further five films; all but one were directed by Hu or Ariffien. Saeroen wrote two of them, leaving for Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). Much of the cast remained with Union for several productions. The company's subsequent production, Asmara Moerni (1941), for instance, had Djoewariah in the leading role, alongside a new hire (the doctor Adnan Kapau Gani). Union Films was ultimately dissolved following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942. In 2011 Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed the poster for Bajar Dengan Djiwa as one of the best Indonesian film posters of all time. Bajar Dengan Djiwa was screened as late as October 1943, but is now probably lost. In common with the rest of the world then, movies in the Indies were shot on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old Indies films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films can be found at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

It is an active parish church in the Archdiocese of Liverpool and in St Joseph's Pastoral Area. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between about 1840 and 1842, and was designed by A. W. N. Pugin. Of this church, only the west steeple has survived. The body of the church was completely rebuilt in 1951–57, and was designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott. Architecture =Exterior= The steeple is built in red sandstone, and consists of a tower with a broach spire. It is in Decorated style and has fine carved detail. The tower is in four stages, with diagonal buttresses and a pointed west entrance. Over the entrance is a three-light window, and in the third stage are lancet windows on three sides. The top stage contains two- light bell openings. On the spire are three tiers of lucarnes. To the south of the steeple is a canted stair turret with a stone hipped roof. Other than the west front, the body of the church is in brick, with four-light Perpendicular windows along the sides of the aisles. =Interior= Looking along the nave towards the altar Inside the church the walls are in stone up to head height, and in painted concrete above. The piers of the arcades carry hyperbolic concrete arches spreading in four directions. The high altar is surrounded by a baldacchino in multi-coloured marble. The nave altar and the lectern stand on a platform. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Ainscough, and rebuilt in 1987 by Rushworth and Dreaper. Associated buildings South of the church is a group of buildings that evoke \\"Pugin's ideal of a medieval Christian community\\". =Presbytery= This was built in 1857 and designed by E. W. Pugin. It stands to the south of the church, and is built in stone with a slate roof. The presbytery has two storeys, and a front of four bays. The end bays project forward, the first bay under a gable, the fourth bay with a bay window under a hipped roof. Above the entrance in the third bay is a niche containing a statue of Saint Oswald. The presbytery is listed at Grade II. =Schools and parish hall= To the southwest of the church are two former schools with gables facing St Oswald's Street. That nearer the church is a simple building, in one storey, and with plain mullioned windows. Beyond this is a larger former school, dating from about 1855, and possibly designed by A. W. N. Pugin. It is in sandstone with a slate roof, has two storeys, and is in a T-shaped plan, with a front of seven bays. The windows on the sides are ogee-headed lancets, and at the end facing the street is a three-light Decorated window. The school was later used as a youth centre, and is designated as a Grade II listed building. To the south of this is a former Methodist chapel of 1845. It is a simple rectangular stuccoed brick building with round-headed windows, which has been converted for use as the parish hall. =Convent of Mercy= This is a sandstone group of buildings with slate roofs attached to the rear of the smaller school, which was almost certainly designed by A. W. N. Pugin. It consists of ranges of buildings on the north and east sides of a courtyard in one and two storeys. The convent building itself is small, containing only eight cells, with a chapel on the first floor. The convent complex is a Grade II listed building.

The conference took place on 22 January 2014 in Montreux, on 23–31 January 2014 in Geneva (Switzerland), and again on 10–15 February 2014. This conference was pursued by UN peace envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi in cooperation with the United States and Russia. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 1,870 people died across Syria during the nine days of the conference.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Feb-01/246045-at- least-1870-die-during-geneva-talks.ashx#axzz2rwVSpFO4 At least 1,870 die during Geneva talks New peace negotiations took place in 2016 in the new Geneva peace talks on Syria (2016).  Background  = June 2012 Geneva \\"action group\\" = An \\"action group\\" conference (now referred to as Geneva I Conference on Syria) was held on Saturday 30 June 2012, in Geneva, initiated by the then UN peace envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, and attended by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, a representative of China, British Foreign Secretary Hague, and Kofi Annan. Mr Annan, issuing a communiqué, said that the conference agreed on the need for a \\"transitional government body with full executive powers\\" which could include members of the present Syrian government and of the opposition. William Hague said that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the US, Russia, China, France and the UK – supported Mr Annan's efforts. Clinton however suggested that Syrian president Assad could, in such transitional government, not remain in power, which immediately was contradicted by Lavrov. The final communiquéAction Group for Syria Final Communiqué, 30 June 2012 states that any political settlement must deliver a transition that: * Offers a perspective for the future that can be shared by all in Syria. * Establishes clear steps according to a firm time-table towards the realization of that perspective. * Can be implemented in a climate of safety for all, stability and calm. * Is reached rapidly without further bloodshed and violence and is credible. The key steps in the transition should include: * Establishment of a transitional governing body with full executive powers that could include members of the government and opposition, and should be formed on the basis of mutual consent. * Participation of all groups and segments of society in Syria in a meaningful national dialogue process. * Review of the constitutional order and the legal system. * Free and fair multi-party elections for the new institutions and offices that have been established. * Full representation of women in all aspects of the transition. =Brahimi Initiative= After this June 2012 meeting, Lakhdar Brahimi, who was appointed as the new UN peace envoy to Syria in August 2012, started to prepare an international conference on ending Syria's civil war, in close cooperation with the Russian Federation and the United States. Two Syrian delegations, both the government and opposition, would be brought together at the conference. In May 2013, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to try to \\"bring both sides to the table\\" to end the bloodshed. Their initiative gained greater impetus after Ghouta chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus killed hundreds of people, on 21 August 2013.  Aims  The objectives of the Geneva II conference are to bring one delegation representing the Syrian Ba'athist government and one representing the Syrian opposition together to discuss how to implement the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 (a \\"transitional government\\"), end the war, and start a process toward a New Syrian republic. Attitudes by Syrian groups and by the US and Russia towards the role of President Bashar al-Assad in a transitional period differ and are expected by The Economist magazine to constitute a major issue at the conference.  Obstacles before 'Geneva II'  Brahimi said in August 2013 that the main problem was getting the different groups in Syria and their different international supporters to accept the \\"very principle of a political solution.\\" He said that this has been the UN approach to the Syrian civil war since the war began. Brahimi said that his > main message to the Syrian parties ... [is] that there is no military > solution to this devastating conflict. Only a political solution will put an > end to it. And the basis for such a solution does exist. It is the > Communiqué issued on 30 June 2012, after the meeting, in Geneva, of the so > called 'Action Group' of countries convened at the initiative of Kofi Annan. The Syrian government said on 3 November 2013, that the comments of US Secretary of State John Kerry could cause the peace talks to fail, because they are \\"an aggression against the Syrian people's right to decide their future.\\"  Participants  Map of countries participating in the Geneva II peace conference shown in green and Syria in red. The list of the participant countries of the Geneva II Conference on Syria was determined on 20 December 2013. ;International organizations:  * ;States and subjects of public international law: = Syrian participation = On 22 July 2013 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the Syrian government is ready to engage in the conference without preconditions. On 25 November 2013, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced that on the planned conference on 22 January 2014, members of the Syrian government and of the opposition will be present. Following the publication of the list of participants on 20 December 2013. Hassan Abboud, the leader of Ahrar ash-Sham, has said that it not be bound by the outcome of the talks. The Islamic Front has rejected the talks. The Syrian National Council has withdrawn from the Syrian National Coalition in protest at the decision of the coalition to attend the talks. The Syria Revolutionaries Front and the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union have supported the talks and want to be represented at the conference. On 20 December 2013, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party requested a delegation to the conference, citing the fact that Kurdish forces had created a semi-Autonomous state in northern Syria but were not invited. The opposition delegation is headed by Hadi al-Bahra. = Iranian participation = In May 2013, Iranian Ambassador to the UN Mohammad Khazaee said that Iran would decide on its participation in the conference, depending \\"on the details that we will consider when we receive them.\\" On 19 January 2014, the Syrian National Coalition threatened to leave the talks after a last minute (by measure of days) invitation to the Iranian government by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to participate in the conference in Montreux, 22 January. The United States viewed the invitation to Iran to attend the Geneva II conference as conditioned on Iran's explicit and public support for the full implementation of the Geneva I communiqué.Press statement of the US Department of State, 19 January 2014, http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/01/220043.htm. Following nearly 24 hours of confusion Ban Ki-moon rescinded the invitation to Iran; the Syrian National Coalition announced that it would attend the conference shortly afterwards.  Proposed dates  The conference was initially proposed for the end of May 2013, with participation expected by representatives of the Syrian National Coalition, the president Bashar al-Assad government of Syria, the United States and Russia, and coordination by Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN peace envoy for Syria. In late June, the United States postponed the conference.US all but rules out Syria conference in July, Al Arabiya News, 26 June 2013. Retrieved 24 November 2013. In mid-August 2013, UN diplomats tentatively proposed mid- October 2013 for the conference date. On 5 November 2013, Brahimi said that US and Russia could not reach an agreement over the date for the conference, and further deliberation over the pursued conference would take place 25 November 2013. As a November date could not be agreed, Brahimi still hoped to get a meeting before the end of 2013. On 14 November, it was reported the conference may take place beginning 12 December 2013. The report allegedly quoted a message from the US Secretary of State John Kerry to his French counterpart Laurent Fabius. On 25 November 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon announced that the conference would be held on 22 January 2014. Preparations In August 2013, Lakhdar Brahimi moved his headquarters from Cairo to Geneva in order to prepare for the conference. Brahimi stated that his office kept \\"communication channels open\\" with the al-Assad government through an office in Damascus, with the civilian and armed opposition groups in Syria and in exile, and with \\"various groups representing civil society, including women, both inside and outside Syria.\\" He said that the UN is encouraging all groups to guarantee the participation of women and other components of \\"civil society\\" in the peace and reconstruction process. In early August 2013, meetings took place in Paris between US Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford and Syrian opposition members to plan for the conference and discuss the chances of reaching a consensual political balance for all involved groups to meet together for negotiations. Elements of a \\"shared political platform\\" to be discussed by a pre-Geneva-II meeting of up to 25 members of various opposition groups included a \\"civil democratic transitional period\\" that would begin with the conference, preparing drafts of documents with constitutional principles and transitional justice for a transitional period, reorganisation of security and military forces, cooperation rather than competition between opposition groups, post-war reconstruction, media policy, and the balance between difference opposition civilian and military components. A pre-Geneva-II meeting in The Hague by senior US and Russian diplomats was planned for 28 August 2013 but postponed by the US Department of State because of \\"ongoing consultations\\" relating to the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attacks. A Department of State representative stated that the US \\"would work with Russia to reschedule [the] planned meeting and that the alleged chemical weapons attack demonstrated the need for a 'comprehensive and durable political solution'.\\" Conference Evangelos Venizelos and Emma Bonino On 22 January 2014 the conference started in Montreux. Foreign ministers from forty countries made statements. US Secretary of State John Kerry stated the US view that Assad is obliged to step down as part of any transitional Syrian administration: \\"There is no way, no way possible, that a man who has led a brutal response to his own people can regain legitimacy to govern\\". Syrian National Coalition leader Ahmed Jarba called on the government to immediately transfer power to a transitional authority. In response to Kerry, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated: He accused a number of states of supporting terrorism and deliberately attempting to destabilize Syria. On Friday 24 January 2014, the opposing sides would hold their first face-to-face talks, in the presence of United Nations mediators. It was later said in the talks that Assad's position as President is non-negotiable. Still later on 24 January, United Nations spokeswoman, Alessandra Velluci, told a news briefing in Geneva, \\"This process is being shaped at the moment. It has to take time for the preparations. There are no Syrian-Syrian talks at the moment. I cannot tell you anything about what will happen in the next few days.\\"United Nations spokeswoman, Alessandra Velluci speaks at news briefing Friday 24 Jan __ al Jazeera (english)  http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/103000598 The first round of talks ended on 31 January.'No progress to speak of' as first round of UN- sponsored Syrian peace talks ends  UN News Centre, 31 January 2014  http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/h%3Cspan%20class=%27pullme%27%3EIn%20short,%20when%20you%20empower%20a%20woman,%20you%20change%20the%20world%3C/span%3Ettp://www.unfpa.org/html/www.unicef.org/story.asp?NewsID=47052&Cr;=syria&Cr1;=#.Uu2E5vtjHHl The second round of negotiations took place on 10–15 February 2014, but yielded no tangible results.

The Syrian National Council which was part of the Syrian National Coalition withdrew from the coalition on 20 January 2014 in protest at the decision of the latter to attend the Geneva talks. On 22 January, in reaction to the UN Secretary General's withdrawal of the invitation to his country to participate in the conference, Iranian President Hasan Rouhani stated that the \\"lack of influential players\\" attending meant that he doubted the ability of Geneva II to solve the crisis.

It is believed to be the longest continuous serving site for signals intelligence in the world. History The Royal Navy first established a Wireless Telegraphy Station in Scarborough in 1912. Since 1914, it has conducted signals intelligence (Sigint). During the First World War, the station's purpose was to monitor the German High Seas Fleet which was making attacks on the East Coast of England. Following the cessation of hostilities in 1918, the role of the station was widened to include diplomatic communications, with resources eventually being split between the diplomatic and the naval aspects. In 1932, a proposal was made to close the Scarborough station and transfer its duties to RAF Flowerdown in Hampshire, but eventually this proposal was turned down and the station resumed operations in 1935. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Scarborough station was classified as a Y-station. It intercepted German naval and naval air communications, and also controlled a direction finding network. The station's complement became a mix of civilian members of the Admiralty Civilian Shore Wireless Service (ACSWS) and service personnel, to be augmented by members of the Women's Royal Naval Service later in the war. In May 1941, the station played a central role in the location and sinking of the Bismarck, for which they were later thanked by then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill. A footpath on the outskirts of the station. The station moved to its present location in 1943, which at the time was a \\"half-buried bomb-proof bunker\\". Following the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War, the station became the main station for the interception of Soviet naval communications. The station intercepted communications from Soviet ships at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis; the reports were sent directly to the White House. In 1965, ACSWS was transferred to the control of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and became part of a network known as the Composite Signals Organisation (CSO). The station became known as CSOS Irton Moor. Work on a new building began in 1972 and all operations had been transferred from the \\"bunker\\" to the new building by 1974. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain in the early 1990s, the role of Sigint in the UK became less important, and the functions of both GCHQ Cheadle and GCHQ Culmhead were transferred to Scarborough in 1995 and 1998, respectively. In July 2001, the site name changed to GCHQ Scarborough. On 1 June 2007 GCHQ Scarborough was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the site. In 2014, the station celebrated its centenary, and was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales. The site is considered the longest continuously-running Sigint station in the world. It was announced in July 2016, that the base was to be allocated £42 million of funding in order to become the 'training and skills hub for the north of England'. The four-year package will see £30 million spent on infrastructure, and £12 million on training skills (most specifically, a recruitment drive aimed at middle-aged women). Role Through the exploitation of SIGINT, GCHQ Scarborough's remit is to gain intelligence from global communications to protect deployed forces around the world and to assist law enforcement agencies in preventing organised crime (human trafficking, child sexual exploitation and drug smuggling) and terror-related activity. In 2018, more than 200 people worked at the site, with a full fall- back contingency in case the main GCHQ site at Cheltenham should be off line for any reason. With the new ATTIC building (Alan Turing Training and Innovation Centre), which coordinates training for the northern GCHQ network, staffing should rise to 300 at the site before 2020.

The site is located at the fifth mile of Via Tuscolana to the southeast of Rome and forms part of the Appian Way Regional Park. It was the second-largest villa in the suburbs of Ancient Rome after that of Quintiles. The name, known since the Middle Ages, is derived from Septimius Basso, prefect under the Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211), and a possible owner of the villa. The site, however, dates back to Antoninus Pius (138–161) and was inhabited until the beginning of the fourth century, and maintained by additional restorations for two more centuries. The residential area consists of three contiguous parts, dating back to three different stages following rapid chronological succession. The parts are rectangular and are arranged aligned from east to west. There were also gardens and a main park onto which the buildings looked. The easternmost building was built between 134 and 139 at the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius following a traditional structure of 50 meters on each side and a peristyle in the northwest of about 45 square meters per side. The plan is compact, with no windows facing outward. The second building was constructed to the southwest of the previous peristyle, between 140 and 150. It has a length of 45 m and is 25 m wide, and includes a panoramic south-facing rotunda. It is a structure linked to luxury, without any functional character. The third structure is believed to have been constructed at the end of the reign of Antonius Pius, and is the most elaborate with large spa rooms. To the northwest of the villa was a series of houses with warehouses, temples and cisterns. This was where the rural population lived and most of the agricultural and domestic activities took place. The area has not been the subject of archaeological investigation but remains of a small temple are clearly visible. This was rectangular and constructed of brick, had vaulted ceilings and was gabled. It contained a rectangular apse for the Divine Statue. The area of the villa also contained a Hippodrome, as well as cisterns that obtained their water from an aqueduct dedicated to the villa. Remains of one of the cisterns form the foundations of a farmhouse on the property. The condition of these ruins is poor. In February 2014 a buttress collapsed. This was attributed to heavy rain but excavations have shown that the building materials used were of low quality. Also the area was subjected to some bombing during the Second World War.

From left to right: Ulrich Rauscher (chief press officer), Robert Schmidt, Eugen Schiffer, Philipp Scheidemann, Otto Landsberg, Rudolf Wissell, Gustav Bauer, Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Eduard David, Hugo Preuss, Johannes Giesberts, Johannes Bell, Georg Gothein, Gustav Noske The Scheidemann cabinet (German: Kabinett Scheidemann) was the first democratically elected Reichsregierung of the German Reich. It took office on 13 February 1919. Although the Weimar Constitution was not in force yet, it is generally counted as the first government of the Weimar Republic. It was based on the Weimar Coalition of centre-left parties. Ministerpräsident Philipp Scheidemann resigned in protest against the Treaty of Versailles on 20 June 1919. His cabinet was followed by the government of Gustav Bauer. Election and establishment Philipp Scheidemann Bernhard Dernburg (July 1931) Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau (1918) Hugo Preuß (before 1925) Robert Schmidt (before 1919) Gustav Bauer (1920) Council of the People's Deputies: Otto Landsberg, Philipp Scheidemann, Gustav Noske, Friedrich Ebert, Rudolf Wissell (December 1918) Johannes Bell (1908) Eduard David (1919) Matthias Erzberger (1919) Following the collapse of the German Empire and the German Revolution of 1918-19, on 19 January 1919 the Germans had voted in elections for the Nationalversammlung. At the time, the country was governed by the Council of the People's Deputies (Rat der Volksbeauftragten), a revolutionary government made up of members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which had also been the largest party in the Reichstag since the last elections in 1912. The January elections returned a smaller than expected share of the vote for the socialists (SPD: 38%, USPD: 7%, the communists of the KPD had boycotted the elections). The National Assembly, meeting in Weimar because conditions in the capital Berlin were deemed too chaotic for the deliberations and Weimar was associated with Weimar Classicism, acted as unicameral legislature and constituent assembly for the new republic. After its inaugural session on 6 February it passed a provisional constitution known as Gesetz über die vorläufige Reichsgewalt. Friedrich Ebert (SPD), chairman of the Council of the People's Deputies, was elected on 11 February as temporary Reichspräsident, or head of state. That same day, Ebert asked his fellow Volksbeauftragter Philipp Scheidemann (SPD) to form the new government, referred to in the law as Reichsministerium. In fact, at that point, coalition negotiations had been going on for a while. The SPD was talking to the DDP and the Zentrum. However, the SPD was making this cooperation conditional on the acceptance by the \\"bourgeois\\" parties of a) a republican form of state, b) a fiscal policy that would \\"severely\\" target wealth and c) a socialisation of \\"suitable\\" industries. Although the SPD did approach the USPD, Ebert reportedly said that he had only conducted talks with the extreme left so that they would bear the responsibility for the talks' failure. For their part, the DDP would not have accepted a coalition with the USPD. The negotiations were difficult and dragged on. In particular, the presidency of the National Assembly was hotly contested and almost caused the talks to fail. Finally, it was agreed that Eduard David (SPD) who had been the initial president would resign (and join the cabinet in compensation), making way for the former president of the Reichstag, Constantin Fehrenbach (Zentrum). Apart from Ebert himself–who had said that he preferred the more representative office of head of state–Scheidemann had been the clear favourite to become head of government. With the exception of Ebert all the other Volksbeauftragen joined the new cabinet. Gustav Noske had previously been in charge of Army and Navy affairs, and he became Defence Minister. Otto Landsberg, the leading thinker on law on the Council became Minister of Justice. Rudolf Wissell had been in charge of economic affairs and kept that portfolio. Gustav Bauer had been a member of the Cabinet Baden in charge of the newly formed Labour Ministry (Reichsarbeitsamt), a position he had continued to hold through the revolution. Robert Schmidt (Minister for Food) and Eduard David, with no portfolio but charged with looking at the question of what responsibility Germany had in bringing about the Great War, completed the SPD members of cabinet. Against seven members from the SPD there were three from the DDP (Hugo Preuß, Georg Gothein and Eugen Schiffer) and three from the Zentrum (Johannes Giesberts, Johannes Bell and Matthias Erzberger). Schiffer had been a member of the National Liberal Party and served as Secretary of State for the Treasury in the Empire but had joined the DDP after the November revolution. Erzberger had been a member of the Cabinet Baden, had negotiated the Armistice in November 1918 and remained in charge of negotiations with the Allies. In the coalition talks, Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau had been treated as a member of the DDP although he did not belong to the party. He was a career diplomat and in January 1919 Ebert and Scheidemann had asked him to take over the office of Secretary of State of the Foreign Office. This was also the portfolio he held in the Cabinet Scheidemann. Finally, in addition to these fourteen politicians there were three members of the military who had an ex officio seat at the cabinet table but no right to vote in decisions of the cabinet. They were the Prussian Minister of War, since early January 1919 Oberst Walther Reinhardt, Oberstleutnant Joseph Koeth who headed the former Reichsamt now Reichsministerium für die wirtschaftliche Demobilmachung (i.e. was in charge of the transition from a war economy to a peace time economy) and the head of the Navy. Initially, the latter position was held by the acting Secretary of State for the Navy who had no official standing in the cabinet at all. This changed after the Reichsmarineamt was dissolved and replaced with the Admiralty in March 1919. Chef der Admiralität Adolf von Trotha then became a non-voting member of the cabinet. Two features of the cabinet are conspicuous: Firstly, the balance of power between seven SPD members and seven representatives (if Brockdorff-Rantzau is counted as DDP) from the \\"bourgeois\\" parties. Secondly, there was a strong continuity in the personnel of government, especially considering the fact that the country had just gone through a revolution. Seven members of the Cabinet Scheidemann had been Secretary of State or Undersecretary under the final Imperial government of Max von Baden (Scheidemann, Schiffer, Bauer, Schmidt, Giesberts, David and Erzberger). Another six had held offices under the Council of the People's Deputies (Brockdorff-Rantzau, Preuß, Wissell, Noske, Landsberg and Koeth). Among the Social Democrats, the moderates or conservative \\"reformists\\" predominated. This constellation enabled the government to draw on considerable experience in government and administration, but it underscored the distance between the government and some of the driving forces behind the revolution, notably the unions, the far-left and many common workers. Nevertheless, the Cabinet Scheidemann was based on parties representing more than 75% of all voters. No other government of the Weimar Republic would ever have a larger majority in parliament (Nationalversammlung or Reichstag). Overview of the members The members of the cabinet (known collectively as Reichsministerium) were as follows: =Notes= Legal position and differences with other cabinets of the German Reich The legal position of the Cabinet Scheidemann was different from both its predecessors under the Empire and those that followed it. Since it was set up to operate only as a transitory government until the new constitution came into force, it was very provisional and improvised in nature. The law that established it was quite vague in many respects. The cabinet's role was mentioned in the law only as follows: * §2: For bringing government proposals to the National Assembly the assent of the Staatenausschuss (the chamber in which the individual states were represented) was needed. If no consensus could be found between cabinet and Staatenausschuss both versions would be submitted. * §3: Members of the government had the right to attend sessions of the National Assembly and to speak there at any time. * §8: For the purpose of governance the Reichspräsident was to appoint a Reichsministerium which would be in charge of all Reichsbehörden (Reich agencies) including the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL). The Reichsminister were required to possess the confidence of the National Assembly. *§9: All decrees and executive orders of the Reichspräsident required the counter-signature of a Reichsminister. The Reichsminister were accountable to the National Assembly for the conduct of their affairs. It remained unclear what consequences it would have if a Reichsminister lost the confidence of the National Assembly. The most obvious difference with the system under the old Empire and with future cabinets under the Weimar Constitution was that this government was based on the principle of equality between all its members (Kollegialkabinett). The Ministerpräsident was not even mentioned in the law, he thus lacked any special powers and real standing. In fact, he was not much more than a moderator. By contrast, under the old system all the Staatssekretäre had reported directly to the Chancellor, he had been the only \\"minister\\" (accountable to the Emperor and, after the change in the constitution in October 1918, to the Reichstag). The Übergangsgesetz of 4 March clarified the legal position of the existing body of law and its relation to those laws passed by the National Assembly. It also stipulated that the old Imperial constitution was still valid, unless it was in contradiction to a newer law. The constitutional position of the Reichstag was taken over by the National Assembly, that of the Bundesrat by the Staatenausschuss, the Emperor was replaced by the Reichspräsident and the Reichsministerium replaced the Chancellor. The powers previously vested within the centralised position of the Chancellor were thus distributed to all members of the cabinet who were independently responsible for their portfolios. This played a crucial role in accommodating the quarrels and the lack of cooperation that were to become a defining feature of the Cabinet Scheidemann. Finally, the Erlaß des Reichspräsidenten betreffend die Errichtung und Bezeichnung der obersten Reichsbehörden (presidential decree on setting up the highest national authorities) of 21 March 1919 established the various portfolios within the Reichsministerium. However, it also added a confusing new contradiction by allocating the responsibility for \\"conducting the affairs of the Reich\\" to the Reichsministerium whilst the original Gesetz had allocated that very task to the Reichspräsident himself. This decree also mentioned the Präsident des Reichsministeriums (i.e. the Ministerpräsident) for the first time. Internal and external security As the January Uprising in Berlin had amply demonstrated, the domestic security situation in the Reich remained highly volatile in early 1919. Shortly after the Cabinet took office, what became known as the Märzkämpfe erupted in Berlin. In addition to these civil-war-like challenges to the parliamentary government by the workers' councils from the left, who wanted to establish a dictatorship of the councils (Räterepublik), there were separatist movements at work in several parts of the country. One of the government's primary tasks thus was to restore law and order and to ensure that the population throughout the Reich accepted it as the legitimate authority. =Left-wing uprisings= The elections of 19 January were another disappointment for the radical left after the KPD as well as the USPD had been further incensed against the government by the bloody suppression of the Januaraufstand (January Uprising). Between February and May 1919 numerous \\"wild\\" (i.e. without union authorization) strikes, armed uprisings and occupation of plants (especially in the mining industry around Halle and in the Ruhr) took place. The workers and their leaders demanded preservation and expansion of the council system, the socialisation of key industries, democratisation of the military via soldiers' councils, higher wages and better working conditions. The government used paramilitary Freikorps and regular troops to crush left-wing uprisings and Räterepubliken. In February, government forces occupied the North Sea ports. Also in February, Freikorps and regular units moved into Mitteldeutschland and subsequently occupied Gotha and Halle. In April, Magdeburg, Helmstadt and Braunschweig were taken, followed by Leipzig and Eisenach in May and Erfurt in June. In Berlin, the radical left parties organised a general strike to achieve the democratisation of the armed forces. The KPD tried to turn the strike into an insurrection. This resulted in a state of emergency being declared. On 9 March, Gustav Noske, endowed with executive power, authorised the military and police to shoot instantly \\"anyone encountered who is fighting government troops with arms\\". Around 1,000 people died in the Märzkämpfe. Similarly, in Bavaria a second Räterepublik had been declared and the government saw a serious risk of the state seceding from the Reich. In mid-April, the government intervened militarily, Munich was taken on 1 May. Once again, hundreds of people including many civilians were killed in the fighting. The left-wing uprisings had been accompanied by widespread strikes that had escalated to a form of civil war in some parts of the country, notably in the Ruhr area. These strikes and resulting economic disruptions were a serious threat to the stability of the Reich, as the supply of food to the population was already tenuous. Since the Allies had threatened to cut off food shipments to a striking Germany and any losses in tax income would make it harder yet to comply with their demands, the strikes were directly endangering negotiations about extensions of the Armistice. =Separatist movements= In the West, the occupied Rhineland had been transformed by the Armistice into an area in which the Reich government was virtually without any effective power. Anti-Prussian and pro-French sentiment ran high among some members of the middle-class in the Rhineland and this was used by the French and Belgian occupation forces to foster separatistic tendencies. The cabinet could react to requests for aid or action from that part of the country mainly by issuing declarations and protest notes to the Allies or by public agitation. However, the scope even for these responses was limited as the Allies might have treated them as violations of the Armistice. The government's appointment of a Reichs- and Staatskommissar for the occupied territory was just a political gesture. The government thus had to work through other channels, like the National Assembly delegates from the area, local dignitaries or the local organisations of the Weimar Coalition parties. The situation was even more complicated in the Ostprovinzen of Prussia. There were obvious separatist groups at work, although paradoxically they arose from patriotic sentiments. German bureaucrats, officers, Volksräte (set up in response to a similar institution of the Poles) and refugees from Posen were developing various ideas for a German or German-Polish ' should the Treaty of Versailles be signed. Although the various plans were inconsistent and contradictory, the general idea was that by temporarily exiting the Reich, these parts (East Prussia, West Prussia, the Netzedistrikt, Silesia and Posen) should deal with the political and military challenges offered by Poland without being bound by the diplomatic shackles imposed on the Reich itself. A new state incorporating East and West Prussia as well as Livland, Kurland and Lithuania was also mooted, drawing on earlier ideas of a United Baltic Duchy. At the time, the Province of Posen was almost completely occupied by Polish forces. Despite a German-Polish armistice there were constant skirmishes along the line of control. Troop concentrations on both sides threatened an escalation of the situation and, due to the relative strength of the forces involved, a reconquest of Posen and possibly even further advances by German troops seemed likely. Although this was primarily a problem for the government of Prussia, the Cabinet had to deal with the issue due to the danger of unauthorised action by the German army or by Posen refugees. Initially trying to appease the separatists with political gestures, the cabinet soon had to re-evaluate the situation as more serious. It considered channeling the political forces in the Ostprovinzen towards a plebiscite about remaining in the Reich. However, the Prussian Government opposed this plan, fearing that a majority might actually decide against continued membership of the Reich. The idea of a plebiscite was dropped. Opposition from the cabinet (especially Gustav Noske), president Friedrich Ebert and Wilhelm Groener of the OHL at Kolberg, helped prevent a secession or a unilateral military move against Poland in the summer of 1919. Walther Reinhardt, however, had been a firm supporter of the Oststaat plan. Economic policies =General issues= A major matter of dispute in the cabinet was the field of economic policy, notably the basic choice of an economic system that was to prevail in the new republic. The SPD was still a socialist party at the time, based on Marxist ideas as laid down in the Erfurter Programm of 1891: once the proletariat had won control over the government, major industrial enterprises were to be socialised (nationalised) in order to achieve the \\"socialization of the means of production\\". The radicalism of this approach was softened somewhat by the theory of \\"revisionism\\", by that time dominant in the SPD, i.e. a tendency to focus on short-term reformist progress rather than on the achievement of long-term goals through revolutionary action. By contrast, the DDP ministers and some from the Zentrum (especially Erzberger) subscribed to a liberal, market- oriented view of the economy. According to this approach, the main goal of economic policy was to maximise productivity. This implied a rapid dismantling of the command economy that had been created during the war years, as well as an end to capital- and currency-controls and to trade barriers. Things were complicated further by a third school of thought that dominated thinking by many in the Reichswirtschaftsamt at the time, notably that of Walther Rathenau and Wichard von Moellendorff. This concept of Gemeinwirtschaftspolitik combined private property rights with a strong element of central planning and a forced syndication (i.e. association) of industries organised by the state. All those involved in the production processes, including the workers, were supposed to play a role in the administration of these industries. Government control of foreign trade also was a key aspect of this policy. These three approaches to economic policy were almost mutually exclusive. Bauer (Labour) and Schmidt (Food) subscribed to views based on the Erfurter Programm. Gothein, Schiffer and Dernburg (Finance) were free-market liberals. Wissell (Economic Affairs) advocated the Gemeinwirtschaftspolitik. To avoid a serious confrontation, the coalition partners kept the economic policies of the cabinet intentionally vague. This became evident in Scheidemann's Regierungserklärung of 13 February which steered clear of topics like foreign trade or the currency altogether. Although this prevented a clash over the cabinet's internal differences, it meant that important decisions on economic policies were not taken by the cabinet but left to individual ministers who would then often come into conflict with each other. This tendency was reinforced by the constitutional equality of the ministers. A direct result were bitter disputes over who was in charge of specific policy issues, made worse by personal animosities between some of the ministers. Scheidemann's Regierungserklärung (government programme) included policies such as improvements in educational standards, the establishment of a people's army, adequate provision for war widows and war-wounded servicemen, establishing the universal right of association in the constitution, acquiring new land for settlement, heavy taxation of wartime profits, and making a start to the planned improvement \\"of public health, protection of mothers, and care of children and young people.\\" In March 1919, strikes in the Ruhr, Mitteldeutschland and Berlin caused the government to announce placating measures that were more in line with Wissell's views than with the liberal or socialist approaches. Wissell used the opportunity to push forward a socialisation program as well as rules for the coal and potash industries. That would be the first and only victory for the advocates of Gemeinwirtschaft, however. In April, a law that was to set up the regulation of the paper industry was first changed substantially by the cabinet and then rejected by the National Assembly. In May, the DDP members of the cabinet attempted to rein in the Reichswirtschaftsministerium by making use of a conflict between Wissell and Schmidt concerning international trade policy. The Brüsseler Abkommen (March 1919) with the Allies governed imports of food on which Germany depended. To ensure funds for these food imports would be available, the cabinet now created a committee called diktatorischer Wirtschaftsausschuß (dictatorial economic committee) consisting of Wissell, Gothein and Schmidt. A simple majority of 2:1 was required for a decision. The committee's decisions on trade and currencies would have the same binding power as cabinet decrees. Wissell was regularly outvoted by the other two. On 6 May, Dernburg announced publicly that the committee would eliminate the wartime coercive industry structures, an important foundation of Wissell's policies. The next day, Wissell wrote a protest note to Scheidemann, demanded an SPD-only cabinet and threatened to resign. He also presented a memorandum and program of action that summarised the Gemeinwirtschaftspolitik approach. Schmidt and Gothein responded by presenting opposing memoranda. Before the row could escalate, the Allies informed the Germans about the content of the Treaty of Versailles and the cabinet focussed on this issue. However, Wissell was on the defensive against those favouring a liberalisation of foreign trade and was unable to push through his views. He did succeed in winning a sort of ceasefire on the issue of abolishing currency controls on 7 June—at that point the cabinet would be in office for only another two weeks. The differences on economic policy within the cabinet were large enough to have brought about a break-up of the coalition sooner or later if the issue of the Treaty had not caused its resignation. Nevertheless, economics was the only field of policy in which the cabinet engaged in medium- to long-term thinking. Otherwise, the cabinet was mostly concerned with dealing with urgent short-term issues (e.g. assistance for the unemployed, for veterans and the wounded or a severe lack of agricultural workers) and taking ad-hoc decisions. =Fiscal policy= This applied in particular to fiscal policy. Moving the Reich's finances from a war footing to a peacetime setting, dealing with the huge rise in public debt caused by the war and closing the large budget deficit were daunting challenges. Yet any systematic approach was impossible given the degree of uncertainty about the contents of the peace treaty. Neither the coming burden from reparations nor—given the prospect of territorial losses—the future productive capacity of the German Reich were known to the government. A significant fiscal reform would have required the transfer of taxation powers (like income, corporate and inheritance) from the individual States (Länder) to the Reich, since under the Empire the central government had been quite dependent on fiscal contributions from the States. Since opposition from the Länder in this respect was to be expected, any progress in that direction was unlikely until the fundamental changes of the new constitution came into force. Fiscal reform thus took place only after the Weimar Constitution had come into force (Erzbergersche Finanzreformen), but Schiffer and Dernburg did some important preparatory work and the Cabinet Scheidemann discussed their proposals. Some of the bills were tabled in the National Assembly under this government, but only debated once it had resigned. =Social policy= A lack of fiscal resources combined with contradictory views in the cabinet also prevented new initiatives in social policy which was a contrast to the activist approach taken by the cabinet's predecessor, the socialist Council of the Peoples' Deputies. Laws prepared but not debated or passed by the cabinet included a codification of all labour laws and a first draft of the Betriebsrätegesetz (law on work councils). Short-term measures mostly fell into the purview of the Reichsministerium für die wirtschaftliche Demobilmachung and it was authorised to take most decisions by simple decree with no need for a cabinet decision. After its dissolution, these powers passed to the relevant ministries, in the case of social policy to the Reichsarbeitsministerium. Foreign policy, armistice and Paris Peace Conference Foreign policy in early 1919 was focussed on the armistice and the subsequent peace treaty. At the time, Germany had diplomatic relations with only a few neutral countries (e.g. Switzerland and the Netherlands), Austria and some countries in Eastern Europe. Relations with the latter were mainly influenced by the presence of German troops in the Baltic states, based on Art. XII of the Armistice (which required the German forces to remain in place as a bulwark against Soviet advances). =Armistice negotiations= Since November 1918, a permanent armistice commission (Waffenstillstandskommission), led by Erzberger, was at work negotiating with the Allies on interpretations of the agreed articles and on prolongations of the armistice (it was extended on 13 December 1918, 16 January 1919, and 16 February 1919). On 16 February, the cabinet voted to reject the conditions for the third extension of the armistice as suggested by Brockdorff-Rantzau. It was deemed inacceptable that the Germans should be barred from resisting Polish military action in Posen and in other places, as long as the Allies refused to guarantee an end to hostilities on the part of the Poles. Whilst the Foreign Minister was willing to refrain from offensive military action, he thought formal acceptance of a line-of-control to be a degrading loss of sovereignty and the new policy of the Allies in regard to Poland to be in violation of Wilson's Fourteen Points. However, intervention by the leaders of the coalition parties caused a change of mind, and the cabinet decided to sign the third prolongation (this time indefinite). Brockdorff-Rantzau considered resigning. The cabinet decided to hand over a note of protest to the Allies, and the final version of the prolongation included some of the changes to the line-of-control requested by the German side. Subsequently, the cabinet largely left it to Erzberger's commission to negotiate with the Allies over the situation in Posen. Similarly, the cabinet was not closely involved in the Brüsseler Lebensmittelabkommen of 14 March 1919 which secured much-needed Allied food shipments to Germany. By contrast, the cabinet dealt at length with the issue of whether to move the Polish Hallerarmee from France to Poland by sea via Danzig due to concerns that it might seize Western Prussia and thus cause the loss of a second province to Poland before the final peace treaty. In the end, the troops were transported across Germany by land (which still caused substantial resentment by Germans from Posen). =Paris conference and peace treaty= The German delegation. From left to right Walther Schücking, Johannes Giesberts, Otto Landsberg, Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Robert Leinert, Karl Melchior (1919) Yet the cabinet focused primarily on the peace treaty. Out of a total of 450 items in the official cabinet minutes, 170 dealt with this issue. Contrary to the way the armistice commission was handled—allowing it to become a sort of parallel government—the cabinet was to directly control the peace delegation. The delegation would possess authority to negotiate only within the confines of the fourteen points (as interpreted by the Germans). Anything that went beyond required the approval of the cabinet, especially the basic decision on acceptance or rejection of the treaty. The cabinet thus held two basic premises: that there would be negotiations and that they would be based on Wilson's fourteen points. There is no evidence that alternative plans for the delegation were made for the case that these expectations would turn out to be wrong. The main reason for these expectations was bad information that fed wishful thinking. The German government was virtually in the dark about what had been decided by the negotiations between the Allies and their associated states in Paris. The cabinet's main sources of information were newspapers and reports by diplomatic staff from neutral countries, both relying heavily on rumours. Preparations for peace negotiations had begun under Brockdorff-Rantzau's lead even before the cabinet was formed. By 27 January 1919, the Council of the People's Deputies had in hand an initial draft on the German position. It was altered multiple times before being finalised on 21 April 1919 as Richtlinien für die deutschen Friedensunterhändler. On 21/22 March 1919 the cabinet had debated the individual points at length and the meeting minutes show significant differences in position between various members of the cabinet. Important organisational issues had also been settled before the cabinet took office. There would be a six-person delegation, supported by a substantial staff of commissioners from the ministries plus experts. In addition, an office of around 160 people was set up in Berlin, attached to the Foreign Office and led by Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, working on questions of detail. It also served as nexus between delegation and cabinet. The cabinet had difficulties agreeing on who was to fill these positions. The members of the delegation were changed several times and even the identity of its leader was not determined until the last moment (both Brockdorff-Rantzau and Landsberg were named in drafts). The composition of the delegation caused significant bad blood between Erzberger and Brockdorff-Rantzau. On 18 April, French General Nudant handed over the invitation to Versailles to the German armistice commission. It was a shock to the cabinet, as the Germans were only to \\"receive\\" the draft of the treaty. The cabinet answered that it would send three civil servants, noting that their task would be simply to transmit the treaty to the government. In response, General Foch demanded that the Germans send delegates who were empowered to \\"negotiate the entirety of questions related to the peace\\". The cabinet now named the delegation that arrived in Versailles on 29 April: Brockdorff-Rantzau (chairman), Landsberg, Giesberts plus non-cabinet members Carl Melchior, a banker, , president of the Prussian constituent assembly (') and mayor of Hanover, and Walther Schücking, an expert in international law. Despite prior efforts to regulate the relationship between cabinet and delegation and the personal presence of several cabinet members in Paris, there was significant disunity between the two institutions. There were three main reasons for this: For one thing, the rules for the delegation had assumed that there would be face-to-face negotiations. Yet despite the fact that the Allied note from 20 April mentioned \\"negotiations\\", the representatives of the Entente now refused to meet the German delegates. For another, the fourteen points which were to delimit the delegation's authority were quite general in many respects, giving scope for delegation and cabinet to argue about jurisdiction. Finally, the personal differences between Erzberger and Brockdorff-Rantzau as well as the latter's hyper-sensitivity regarding encroachments on his authority played a role. The delegation received the Allied conditions for peace on 7 May. Rather than waiting for a comprehensive German counterproposal, it started to send the Allies numerous notes on individual points, most of which were disavowed by the cabinet. Brockdorff-Rantzau complained about this interference by the cabinet, which caused the government to forbid the further use of these notes on 20 May. The delegation ignored this and after threats of resignation by several cabinet ministers, Scheidemann and some other members had to travel to Spa to meet with the delegation and settle the differences. Issues that caused frictions between delegation and cabinet were the question of whether or not the reparation payments should be fixed in absolute terms as well as the question of German disarmament. The latter caused a serious confrontation with the military. The original idea had been to propose a land army of 300,000 men. This was later reduced to 200,000, then 100,000. Just as with the issue of reparations, the cabinet thought that by complaisance in this respect they could limit territorial losses to the Reich. However, the military, notably General Hans von Seeckt (commissioner of the Prussian Minister of War at the delegation) objected vehemently. The cabinet, especially Noske, stood their ground on this issue, though. Other controversies involved the question of responsibility for the war (Kriegsschuldfrage) and the possibility of bringing about an intervention by neutral countries in the case of unacceptable Allied demands (an idea of Erzberger's vigorously opposed by the Foreign Minister), which caused Reichskolonialminister Bell to travel to Versailles on 2 June, trying to mediate. In the end, it turned out that all the arguments between cabinet and delegation had been pointless. On 16 June, the Allies presented the final version of their conditions for peace. In virtually no respect had the Allied demands been scaled back compared to the first draft of 7 May. The sole exception was the acceptance of a plebiscite in Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia). The negotiations in Versailles had been negotiations in name only. Allied ultimatum and resignation of the cabinet =Initial position on the draft Treaty= Mass demonstration against the Peace Treaty in front of the Reichstag building, 15 May 1919 In May, the cabinet decided to refrain from making an instant statement in reaction to the initial Allied draft of the Peace Treaty, hoping to achieve changes through negotiations. However, Scheidemann himself said that the Treaty was unerträglich (intolerable) and unerfüllbar (unfulfillable). On 12 May, he called it unannehmbar (unacceptable) in the National Assembly, to the acclaim of almost all the parties. In the cabinet, it was in particular the representatives of the DDP who threatened to resign unless the Treaty was rejected. Yet the cabinet decision specifically ruled out acceptance of the Treaty only \\"in its current form\\". On 3/4 June, the cabinet had a discussion about the possibility that the Allies would refuse to make any significant changes to the Treaty. Only Erzberger, David, Wissell and Noske clearly favoured signing in that case, all others were (to different degrees) opposed. Even at that stage, Wissell noted that the Cabinet Scheidemann would not be able to sign and that a replacement government would have to be established. At least since late May, the cabinet had seriously discussed the ramifications of a German refusal to sign. In that case, the cabinet expected Allied troops to occupy Germany. Detailed contingency plans for such a scenario were not made, to avoid providing the USPD, which had argued for signing the Treaty, with political ammunition. Since the OHL planned to move all German troops to the east of the Elbe river should there be a resumption of hostilities, the cabinet was concerned about the actions of those States left unprotected by that strategy (Bavaria, Hesse, Baden and Württemberg). Leftist uprisings and/or a separate peace by these States were feared. =Reaction to the Allied ultimatum of 16 June= On 16 June, the Allies gave the German side five days to accept the treaty (later extended to seven days). The cabinet now faced a stark choice between acceptance, refusal and resignation. According to the Peace Delegation's assessment, the final Treaty was not in any meaningful way different from the version deemed \\"unacceptable\\" in May. Ultimately, however, the choice between acceptance and refusal rested with the majority parties and the National Assembly. Over the next several days, there seem to have been constant discussions between members of the cabinet, president Ebert, the Peace Delegation, and party representatives. The chronological order is somewhat uncertain, but has been reconstructed as follows: On the morning of 18 June, the Peace Delegation returned to Weimar, Brockdorff-Rantzau reported to the cabinet and presented the common assessment of the delegation. After discussions in the parliamentary groups of the parties, the cabinet met again in the evening. There was no consensus on signing the Treaty. A vote showed that the cabinet was split (7 to 7 according to Erzberger's recollection; 8 for and 6 against signature, according to Landsberg). Since the cabinet was unable to reach a decision, the parties now had to decide. An important influence was the possibility (or lack thereof) of resuming hostilities against the Allies with any hope of success. As early as 21 May, the OHL had surveyed the Generalkommandos (regional commands) on this question – with a clearly negative response. General Wilhelm Groener consequently argued in favour of signing the Treaty. He thus opposed the position of Prussian Kriegsminister Reinhardt as well as the majority of Reichswehr commanders who at a meeting on 19 June went so far as to openly threaten a revolt against the government should the Treaty be signed. Paul von Hindenburg, who was nominally in charge of the OHL, deferred to Groener on this issue. The position of the OHL provided significant if not decisive support for those favouring signature of the Treaty. On 19 June, majorities of the parliamentary groups of SPD and Zentrum expressed support for signing, but the DDP was opposed. Later that day, the cabinet held a meeting with the Staatenausschuss, where a majority of the States supported acceptance of the Treaty. The crucial meeting of the cabinet took place that evening with the participation of party representatives. The DDP had prepared a mediation proposal to be handed to the Allies which included substantial changes to some of the Treaty's stipulations. If this was accepted by the Allies the DDP was willing to sign the Treaty. However, the cabinet was unable to reach a consensus on this issue. With no solution in sight, Scheidemann ended the meeting around midnight, went to see Reichspräsident Ebert and announced his resignation, along with Landsberg and Brockdorff-Rantzau. The cabinet remained in office for another day and a half, since there were difficulties in forming a new government, willing to take responsibility for signing the Treaty. The DDP insisted on transmitting its proposal to the Allies, and it was almost sent, but was vetoed by the SPD in the last minute. Hermann Müller and Eduard David were both considered as new Reichsministerpräsident. Only on the morning of 21 June, when the DDP finally decided to stay out of the new government, Gustav Bauer was ready to lead a SPD and Zentrum cabinet that was willing to sign. The term of office of the Cabinet Scheidemann ended on 21 June at around 3 p.m. with the first cabinet meeting of the Bauer cabinet.
