Paul Bartsch, his collaborator, later thought it was a subgenus of Turbonilla.P. Bartsch (1904), Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, vol. 17. p. 9 Johannes Thiele does not even mention this genus in his Handbuch der Systematischen Weichtierkunde. (1929). Wilhelm August Wenz in his Handbuch der Paläozoologie, Band 6, Gastropoda, also thought it was probably a subgenus of Turbonilla, but added a question mark. However, a close examination shows that it belongs in the family Pyramidellidae, close to Tryptichus Mörch, 1875, differing from it only in having one (instead of two) basal entral spiral cords and having no columellar fold.

Warner (July 5, 1929 – September 7, 2002) was an American college basketball player. He was one of the stars of the 1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team, the only team to win both the NCAA tournament and the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in the same year. He was also a central figure in the point shaving scandal that came to light in the aftermath of that season. College career Warner came from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx to play college basketball for Nat Holman at the City College of New York. A 6'3 forward, Warner regularly battled with bigger men to average 14.8 points per game as a sophomore for the Beavers during their championship year. In the 1950 NIT, Warner upped this average to 21.7 per game and was named tournament Most Valuable Player as CCNY defeated Bradley in the final at Madison Square Garden. A couple of weeks later, Warner and the Beavers again beat Bradley, this time in the 1950 NCAA tournament, to become the only team to win both tournaments in the same year. Point shaving scandal The next season, Warner and teammate Ed Roman were named co-captains for the Beavers and were poised to defend their championship titles. However, on February 18, 1951, New York City District Attorney Frank Hogan arrested seven men for shaving points - including Ed Warner. While a number of the implicated CCNY players received suspended sentences, Warner was sent to prison for six months. One lawyer in the case remarked: > \\"(Judge Saul) Streit considered Warner to be incorrigible and > uncontrollable. Warner was too flamboyant and he also had a record as a > juvenile delinquent. Streit believed in rehabilitation by deprivation\\" For his involvement in fixing games, Ed Warner was permanently banned from playing in the National Basketball Association. Later life After serving his sentence at Rikers Island prison, Warner played several years in the Eastern Basketball Association. In the 1960s, he again found himself in prison for attempting to sell heroin. Warner then officiated high school basketball games until he was partly paralyzed in a car accident in 1984. Ed Warner died on September 7, 2002.

Stanford University Press pp. 1064: Description The small, milk-white shell is pupiform and generally cancellated. It measures 3.2 mm. The whorls of the protoconch number at least two, forming a depressed helicoid spire, whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is all but one-half immersed. The seven whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, strongly contracted at the suture and decidedly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by strong vertical axial ribs of which there are 16 upon the first and second, 18 upon the third to fifth, and 20 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the ribs the whorls are marked by four spiral cords about one-half as strong as the ribs, between the sutures: the first of these is at the angle of the shoulder. The junction of the spiral cords and ribs are nodulous. The spaces enclosed between them are rectangular pits. The sutures are channeled. The periphery of the last whorl is marked by a spiral cord at whose posterior margin the axial ribs terminate. The base produced is moderately rounded, marked by ten spiral cords, which, like the grooves separating them, decrease regularly in size from the periphery to the umbilical area. The grooves on the base are crossed by numerous slender axial threads. The aperture is pyriform, somewhat effuse anteriorly. It is channeled at the posterior angle, which is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, with a simple edge, decidedly arched in the middle, flattened on the side, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is stout, profoundly but distinctly plaited, reflected very much anteriorly. It is provided with a strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thick callus.

Description The regularly conic, yellowish white shell is umbilicated. It measures 4 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are apparently planorboid, very obliquely, almost completely, immersed in the first of the later whorls, only a portion of the last volution being visible. The six whorls of the teleoconch are rather high between the sutures, slightly rounded (almost flattened), and subtabulately shouldered at the summits. They are marked by fine lines of growth and very many subequal, wavy, closely spaced striations. The whorls are somewhat angulated at the periphery and the summit of the succeeding whorls falls a little anterior to the periphery, which gives the sutures a decidedly channeled effect. The base of the body whorl is large, rather prolonged, well rounded. It is marked by spiral striations which are equally as abundant as those between the sutures but somewhat stronger. The suboval aperture is moderately large, and somewhat effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin. The columella is slender, curved, reflected partly over the moderately large umbilicus and provided with a strong, acute, oblique fold near its insertion.

The nuclear whorls are small, very obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns. The five post-nuclear whorls are well rounded. They are marked by four spiral cords between the sutures, the three posterior of which are nodulose on the early whorls. The fourth, or suprasutural one being smooth. On the last whorl the nodules are obsolete. Of these cords, the one at the summit is the weakest and the second below it the strongest. The spaces between the spiral keels are about half as wide as the keels and rather shallow. In addition to the spiral sculpture the whorls are marked by slender, almost axial riblets, which render the three posterior keels on the early whorls nodulose at their intersections. Of these riblets, about 18 occur upon the second and 22 upon the third whorl. On the fourth, which is the penultimate, the grooves between the keels are crossed by slender axial threads. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a narrow, deep sulcus. The base of the shell is moderately long, well rounded. It is marked by five spiral cords which grow successively weaker between the periphery and the umbilical area. The grooves between the sutural cords are equal, crossed by numerous, slender, axial threads, which cause the spaces between the threads and cords to appear as minute pits. The aperture is moderately large, somewhat effuse anteriorly;.The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is moderately long, strong, somewhat curved, and reflected over and adnate to the base. It is provided with a slender fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thin callus.Proceedings of the United States National Museum 42:286 Odostomia (Chrysallida) dicella Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California.

Since resources are limited, groups need to decide on fair ways of apportioning them out to their members. These fairness judgments are determined by procedural and distributive forms of social justice. When payouts do not occur according to these norms, conflicts arise. Procedural justice Procedural justice deals with the methods used in making the decisions about the allocation of the group's resources. Issues arise in this area when groups do not stick to their agreed upon methods for spreading out these resources. Conflicts will arise when the methods used are not consistent, open, or agreed upon by the group. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is \\"did we make the decision in a fair way?\\" Distributive justice Distributive justice deals with how rewards and costs are distributed across the members of the group. Issues might arise in this area when certain members are favored and consistently given premium rewards or apportioned more resources than other members. An analogy here is cutting up a cake into equal pieces, but someone feels that they have unjustly received a smaller piece. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is \\"did I get my fair share?\\" Distributive norms There are five types of distributive norms that help in maintaining distributive justice. * Equity: this is where members' outcomes are based on their inputs to the group effort. Someone who has given more time, money, energy, risk, or other input, should receive more than someone who has contributed less. * Equality: here, all group members receive an equal share of the profit, regardless of their amount of input. * Power: the individuals with higher status, authority, or control receive more in this circumstance. This is akin to managers having a higher salary than lower ranking members of a team of researchers. * Need: with this norm, people in the group with the greatest needs are provided with the necessary amount of resources required to meet those needs. * Responsibility: essentially, this is where those who have more share with those who have less. Consequences of fairness dilemmas The distribution of resources (most often money) is a very common cause of conflict in groups. Individuals tend to push for equality distribution norms when they have not contributed as much to the group. Smaller groups also tend to adopt equality norms, as do women. On the other hand, larger groups, as well as groups that significantly depend on one person's specialized input, prefer equitable distributions for the group. Negative inequity is experienced by group members who feel that they are not receiving fair payment for what they have contributed. This often results in lower quality of work, a reduction in effort (perhaps caused by the sucker effect), or complete withdrawal from the group. In contrast, positive inequality is experienced when members receive too much for the amount of effort they've put forth. This can lead to the individual increasing their efforts to actually deserve what they are receiving, but more often it leads to conflict in the group. Individuals tend to be motivated to maximize their personal rewards, so when they feel they are getting less than they deserve, they react negatively. On the flip side, when members feel like they are being rewarded for their input to the group, and they feel that the group is fairly allocating these rewards, they feel esteemed and proud. Members see a motive for group mates to give less rewards, while being less likely to believe they could be over-rewarded. The reaction in the former instance is shaped more by distributive justice, whereas the latter reaction is shaped more by procedural justice.

Spectrophilia as a fetish Spectrophilia is a fetish that is classified as the paraphilia in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits. Succubus and Incubus In western folklore, the succubus is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. The counterpart of the succubus is the incubus. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen. The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia. Spectrophilia in folklore Many cultures have folklore involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including Arabic, Greek, Hindu, and Celtic culture. Evidence No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among ghost hunters, including Ghost Adventures and the Travel Channel's show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’. In modern fiction Several films have dealt with the concept, among them Ghostbusters (1984), The Entity (1981), Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 7), Ghost (1990) , Dusk Maiden of Amnesia (2008) and It Follows (2014).

History In October 2009, Nike released the CTR360 Maestri, when they were debuted on the pitch by Cesc Fàbregas. The name was meant to reference the Italian for \\"master\\". The CTR360 Maestri was created to complement the existing Nike lines of the Tiempo Legend, Total 90 Laser and Mercurial Vapor. While the Laser and Vapor are designed for the premier striker, the CTR was created for the playmaking midfielder. Upon its launch, the CTR360 was worn by many top football players, such as Andrés Iniesta, Mario Balotelli, Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets, Florent Malouda and Alex Song. Many of the features built into the CTR360 Maestri, were developed to assist players with receiving and distributing the ball, such as dampening pods on the forefoot, and asymmetrical lacing to increase the amount of contact with the ball. To aid distribution, there is a rubberized pass pad on the instep along with memory foam to create a more uniform surface. In order to help improve the player's first touch, Nike developed a new synthetic leather for the boot, called KANGA-LITE. KANGA-LITE is water resistant, similar to other synthetic leathers, but has better ball feel and touch. The launch of the CTR featured two colorways, Black/Red/White and White/Yellow/Black. Subsequent colorways were White/Royal/Silver/Black/Retro, White/Maroon/Gold, White/Cyber/Black and Black/White/Blue. The CTR360 is available in five different outsoles, FG - firm ground, SG - soft ground, AG - artificial grass, TF - turf and IC - indoor. CTR360 Maestri II In December 2010, Cesc Fàbregas again debuted the new CTR on the pitch against rivals Manchester United. The CTR360 Maestri II was designed to build upon the success of its predecessor while making improvements where necessary. The dampening pods on the forefoot were retained, although they were made larger to offer greater control. On the instep, the control pads have gained a fin-like design, similar to that of the T90 Laser III, for added traction. The memory foam on the instep was replaced by a pass and receive pad featuring grip-like traction, inspired by a golf putter. The CTR360 Maestri II is available in the same five outsoles as the original. The debut colorway for the boot was Red/White/Black, followed by White/Black/Blue, White/Black/Yellow, Black/White/Red, Platinum/Blue/Black and the current White/Silver/Purple. Nike have also come out with the \\"clash collection\\" which provided a new colour way White/Blue/black. First two color releases in 2012 for the Nike CTR360 Maestri II is Dark Shadow/Volt and Loyal Blue. Elite Series In anticipation of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Nike released the Elite Series of football boots. The goal was to create faster versions of their shoes, without compromising their most important qualities. In order to reduce the weight of the CTR, a carbon fiber outsole was added which made the boot 19% lighter. The original colorway for the Elite series was Metallic Mach Purple/Total Orange. These colors were chosen to make it easier for players to spot each other on the field. The Elite CTR360 was worn in the World Cup by many players, including Mario Balotelli, Carlos Tevez and Fabio Cannavaro. Since the introduction of the Elite Series in May 2010, there has been an Elite version of every colorway of CTR except the current White/Silver/Purple.  Discontinuation The successful line was ended by Nike when it announced its new silo, Magistas. The replacing of CTR360 received a mixed reception.

They are fairly large to large crabs that typically are reddish in color and spiny, although the size of these spines varies depending on species (from long in species like N. grimaldii to very short in species like N. flindersi, and tending to be more pronounced in small than in large individuals). Various sessile organisms such as barnacles are sometimes attached to their carapace and legs, and small commensal amphipods may live in their carapace. They are occasionally the victims of parasitic snailfish of the genus Careproctus, which lay their egg mass in the gill chamber of the crab, forming a mobile \\"home\\" until they hatch. Conversely, some juvenile Neolithodes have a commensal relationship with Scotoplanes sea cucumbers. To protect itself from large predators, the young crab hides under the sea cucumber.

The character is portrayed by Danny Strong. Biography =Character history= Jonathan was born in 1981 and raised in Sunnydale, California. He attended Sunnydale High School where he was often bullied, ridiculed, and ignored by his more popular peers, thereby developing low self-esteem. Season 2 In 1997, while attending the World Culture Dance, Jonathan is singled out by Ampata Gutierrez, a resurrected Incan princess, who wants to kiss him and transfer his life-force to her own. Not knowing her true nature, he does not resist, believing his luck in love has changed; he is only saved when Xander Harris shows up and, feeling uncomfortable because of Xander's attitude towards Ampata, Jonathan leaves them alone. A week later, Jonathan is picked by Cordelia Chase to accompany her to The Bronze after she has a bad date. The relationship does not last though, and Cordelia soon moves on to Xander. Soon after, he is used momentarily as a hostage by a member of the Order of Turaka, but is quickly let go. The following year, like many others in the school, Jonathan becomes possessed by a Bezoar that has been given to the class by Mr. Whitmore. As soon as Buffy Summers kills the mother Bezoar, he is freed from the Bezoar's control, believing himself to have been caught in a gas leak, as did Buffy's mother, Giles, Willow, Cordelia and others. Jonathan's self-esteem is dealt another crushing blow later that year when he tries out for the school's swim team, does not make it and is bullied by Dodd McAlvy, who repeatedly dunks his head in a bucket of ice cold water to see how long he is able to hold his breath. Buffy saves him, but she also further bashes his esteem, and he goes on to urinate in the swimming pool, which he later confesses to Willow Rosenberg under duress. Season 3 The following academic year, Jonathan becomes a senior and he is invited to a \\"welcome back\\" party for Buffy at her house. Zombies raised by Ovu Mobani crash the party and Jonathan is one of the few guests who make it out alive. Prior to the Homecoming Dance, both Cordelia and Buffy are campaigning to become Homecoming Queen, allowing Jonathan to show his mercenary side by trying to get as much out of both of them as he can in exchange for his vote. Towards the end of that year, while minding his own business, he is singled out by socialite Harmony Kendall and the Cordettes as a possible boyfriend for Cordelia, who has just broken up with Xander. The incident is humiliating for Jonathan and is yet another incident that contributes to his ever-decreasing confidence. Having had enough, Jonathan takes steps to commit suicide atop a bell tower at the high school, leaving a suicide note for Freddy Iverson to publish in the Sunnydale High Sentinel, the school newspaper. Buffy soon tracks Jonathan down, mistakenly believing that he plans to kill other students with his rifle, and informing him that everyone in the school is dealing with just as much pain as he is, but then discovers he was actually going to kill himself. For bringing a gun into the school, Jonathan is suspended for a couple of weeks and ordered to attend counseling. Upon returning to the school, Jonathan's confidence has marginally increased and at the senior prom, he has a date with a girl much taller than he is. At the prom, he also finds the confidence to present Buffy with a Class Protector award. On graduation day, Jonathan joins the rest of the Class of 1999 in fighting against Mayor Richard Wilkins III who has completed his Ascension to become the demon Olvikan. During the battle, he aggressively pounces on many vampires and survives to see the school be blown up and catch a jumpy Cordelia in his arms. Season 4 After trying to kill himself, Jonathan enters into counseling where he meets another suicidal person who teaches him an augmentation spell. The spell revises history, making some of Buffy's accomplishments into Jonathan's (including the destruction of the Master's skeleton, receiving the Class Protector Award, and blowing up Sunnydale High), and enhancing Jonathan's fame and popularity. The spell creates a monster (metaphorically and literally) as though to contrast with the ideal image that Jonathan has created for himself. He is also believed to have starred in The Matrix despite never having left Sunnydale, which is one of a few things that tips off Buffy, whom he has supposedly led in fighting vampires, to discover the spell he has cast. Jonathan reluctantly assists Buffy in killing the monster and thus breaking the illusion; he apologizes to Buffy the following day after the Swedish twins Ilsa and Inga leave him at his mansion and he loses his job as tactical consultant at the Initiative. Season 6 Over a year later, Jonathan, in a moment of boredom, joins Warren Mears and Andrew Wells, and they agree to take over Sunnydale, with Jonathan using his expertise in magic to help them; within the Trio, Jonathan often suggests non-violent plans and is the most reluctant to hurt anyone or kill Buffy, whom he has a soft spot for due to his history with her. A month later, Andrew summons a M'Fashnik Demon to cause a distraction in the Sunnydale Securities Bank while they rob it. Buffy interferes and almost ruins the plan. Over Jonathan's objections, Warren steers the demon into a fight with Buffy, who kills it. Soon afterward, the Trio spend some time harassing Buffy with mystical and technological tests of her abilities, making it a competition among themselves for ingenuity; Jonathan uses a magic bone to put Buffy in a time loop which can only be broken if she performs a seemingly impossible task for a customer at the Magic Box. On escaping the loop, Buffy suspects that she was being tested and nearly succeeds in tracking down the Trio; to shake her, Jonathan uses magic to impersonate a horned demon. It doesn't give Jonathan any increased abilities and he is forced to take a blow from the Slayer, a difficult thing to do. A few weeks later, Jonathan aids the other two in stealing a large diamond from a local museum. A security guard is hit with their freeze ray during the incident. The three are later confronted by Spike, who wants Warren to examine his defective behavior modification chip that forbids him from harming humans. Warren agrees only after Spike threatens to break their Boba Fett action figure. The Trio fight over a device that can turn objects invisible. In 2002, after accidentally making Buffy invisible with another of Warren's gadgets, Jonathan agrees with Andrew that they should return her to normal before she disintegrates. A confrontation between the two sides leads to the Trio's identities being discovered. With the Scooby Gang now knowing who the Trio are and where they are based, the Trio flee Warren's booby-trapped basement. Jonathan suggests turning themselves in to the police when Warren accidentally kills his ex-girlfriend Katrina Silber. Warren decides to frame Buffy for the murder. Although Warren's plan fails, Katrina's death is ruled as a suicide. As neither Warren nor Andrew show remorse, Jonathan feels increasingly alienated from them, and soon finds that they are keeping some of Warren's plans from him. He finally betrays Warren by telling Buffy how to defeat an altered, magically enhanced Warren. Ultimately, Warren escapes, betraying the other two. In jail, Jonathan makes sure that Andrew knows Warren will not be coming to save them, insisting they will be forced to spend time in prison. To make matters worse, while the pair have been in jail, Warren has killed Tara Maclay in an attempt to kill Buffy, causing Willow to go on a homicidal rampage. With Warren dead, Jonathan and Andrew are her next targets. Anya teleports to warn them and Buffy helps them escape, driving them to the Magic Box for protection. Willow eventually tracks them down and the pair accompany Xander and Dawn to safety as Buffy fights Willow. Andrew becomes nervous though and threatens Xander with a sword. Jonathan draws a sword on Andrew, telling him that after Willow is defeated, they will be going back to jail. On the way to another hiding spot, an attack by Willow leaves the two able to flee. They hitch a ride with a trucker and head for Mexico. Season 7 Jonathan's body over the Seal of DanzaltharWhile in Mexico, both Jonathan and Andrew begin having dreams that lead them back to Sunnydale where they know a great power is rising. This is the First Evil. The two return on November 12, with Jonathan having the intention of finding the Seal of Danzalthar and alerting Buffy to it so she can stop the coming evil and allow Jonathan to join the Scooby Gang. As they make their way into the newly rebuilt high school basement to uncover the seal, it is revealed that Andrew is being guided by an ethereal image of Warren. While digging, the two engage in a conversation and Jonathan reveals that he has achieved redemption of a sort: all the pain and hurt associated with his high school years, the pain that shaped his life, has faded away. He wishes the people he spent six years with well, even if they don't care about him (echoing back to \\"Earshot\\"). Andrew is not impressed and with a glance at Warren, stabs Jonathan, letting his blood flow on the seal. Jonathan dies, but his blood isn't sufficient to open the seal due to anemia. Robin Wood, the principal of the new Sunnydale High, discovers and subsequently buries Jonathan. In later episodes, Jonathan's form occasionally appears as an avatar of the First Evil. Writing and acting Strong described the early development of his character in an interview with the U.K. Buffy the Vampire Slayer magazine. He described his character as the \\"Kenny of Buffy. Except that he never dies.\\"Springer, Matt, \\"Big Man on Campus\\", from Buffy the Vampire Slayer magazine #13 (UK, September 2000), page 20-21. Strong had initially auditioned for the role of Xander, but lost out to Nicholas Brendon. He first appeared in the unaired Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot in a bit part simply named \\"Student\\", and subsequently appeared in a number of episodes. He said that often he appeared in scenes that could have been done by other characters but that \\"They'll have Jonathan do it, to keep the continuity of the world\\". Writer/directors David Greenwalt and Marti Noxon both stated in the DVD commentaries for \\"Reptile Boy\\" and \\"What's My Line\\", respectively, that Danny Strong was the actor that they would call on whenever they needed a good victim, both citing his good \\"victim face\\". Eventually the character grew out of this frequent use.Buffy the Vampire Slayer second season DVD set. 20th century Fox (region 1, 2002), disc two and three. Explaining the potential appeal of the character, he said, \\"I think everyone is sort of like Jonathan. Either they're like Jonathan or they're trying to cover up their Jonathan qualities. Either they're awkward and shy, or they're doing everything they can not to appear awkward and shy. I'm not really very shy, but I certainly can be awkward at times.\\" Powers and abilities Over the course of the series Jonathan becomes an accomplished sorcerer, capable of performing reality alterations (cf. \\"Superstar\\"), time loops and glamours (cf. \\"Life Serial\\").

For most of its lifespan it was leased by the Reading Company, and was subsequently merged into the Reading. History The original company was chartered as the Little Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad in 1831.Not to be confused with the Little Schuylkill Navigation, Railroad and Coal Company, operating between Tamaqua and Port Clinton, Pennsylvania. It planned to build a rail line between Tamanend (also called Little Schuylkill Junction; west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania) and Milton. The principals in the company included Christian Brobst and Joseph Paxton of Catawissa. Construction began c. 1835, but the banking panic of 1837 restricted investments needed to continue work on the railroad. In 1849 the company reorganized, to attract new investors, and became the Catawissa, Williamsport and Erie Railroad (CW&E;). In the early 1850s construction resumed, and in 1854 the railroad reached Milton, where it connected with the Sunbury and Erie Railroad (renamed the Philadelphia and Erie in 1861). At Tamanend the railroad connected with the Little Schuylkill Navigation Railroad, which ran along the Little Schuylkill River to Tamaqua and Port Clinton, where it connected to the Reading Company. CW&E; passenger train operations between Catawissa and Tamaqua began in July 1854. A bridge across the Susquehanna River to Rupert was completed in 1855. The route traversed some difficult terrain, and included three tunnels, and eight bridges and trestles. Express train service from Philadelphia to Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Chicago began on 7 May 1855, using the CW&E;, as well as the Reading and Little Schuylkill Navigation lines. The CW&E; went bankrupt in 1859, and reorganized as the Catawissa Railroad (CRR) in 1860. In 1865 the Western Central Railroad and the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad attempted to lease the Catawissa RR. The leases were challenged by the Philadelphia & Erie in litigation, and eventually they were upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. However, the A&GW; declared bankruptcy in 1867, and the CRR then proceeded to operate the line by itself. As of 1868 the company owned 21 locomotives and 269 cars. The company built an engine house and machine shop in Catawissa, on land donated by the town, in 1861. Other support buildings were added to the 12 acre site through 1901. A passenger station was erected in 1878. In 1871 the Catawissa Railroad extended its main line from Milton to Williamsport. The Reading Company leased the Catawissa lines in 1872. In 1893 the CRR lines were consolidated with the Reading's Shamokin Branch. The CRR was formally merged with the Reading Company in 1953. The Reading abandoned various sections of the Catawissa Branch later in the 1950s, through the 1960s. In 1976 the Reading was acquired by Conrail, which abandoned the remaining portions of the Catawissa Branch. Bridges The railroad's bridge over Dark Run was high and long. The bridge at Mainville, the only one in Columbia County, was high and long.https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:Historical_and_Biographical_Annals_of_Columbia_and_Montour_Counties,_Pennsylvania,_Containing_a_Concise_History_of_the_Two_Counties_and_a_Genealogical_and_Biographical_Record_of_Representative_Families.djvu/76&action;=edit See also * List of Pennsylvania railroads References Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads Category:Predecessors of the Reading Company Category:Railway companies established in 1860 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1953 ","title":"Catawissa Railroad"},{"id":"33686084","text":"Al-Fajr Arabsalim Sporting Club () is a Lebanese football club based in Arabsalim, Nabatieh.

Transliteration (American pronunciation recommendation): \\"ree-HAHB TAH-hah\\". Rihab Rashid Taha al-Azawi (; born 12 November 1957) is an Iraqi microbiologist, dubbed Dr Germ by United Nations weapons inspectors, who worked in Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program. A 1999 report commissioned by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) named her as one of the world's most dangerous women. Dr Taha admitted producing germ warfare agents but said they had been destroyed. Rihab Rashida Taha ranks among the most important of a new breed of Third World weapons designers who were highly nationalistic, western-educated and willing to violate any international norms or scientific ethics. Taha worked hard to contribute to Iraqi weapons program. As a result of Taha’s hard work she became known as the mother of all third world biological weapons programs. It was Taha who sold the idea of an Iraqi biological weapons program to Saddam Hussein and was given an award for her work in biological weapons, specifically the development of anthrax and botulinum weapons by Saddam Hussein. Moreover, she has been held up as an example to Iraqi women interested in science. Taha first rose to prominence in the Western media after being named in a 2003 British intelligence dossier, released to the public by the Prime Minister Tony Blair, on Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear capability. The dossier alleged that Taha had played a leading role in the manufacture of anthrax and other biological agents. It was this dossier that triggered the chain of events that led to the death of British UN weapons inspector David Kelly, who was accused of telling a BBC reporter that some of the intelligence had been manipulated. Kelly, as an UNSCOM weapons inspector visiting Iraq on the occasions described below, had interrogated Taha so pitilessly that she was \\"reduced to tears\\".Norman Baker \\"The Strange Death of David Kelly\\", 2007 Background Born in 1957, and a graduate of the University of Baghdad, Taha received her Ph.D in plant toxins from the University of East Anglia's School of Biological Sciences in Norwich, which she attended from 1980 to 1984. She published two articles on her research, co-authored by her supervisor Professor John Turner, once the head of the School of Biological Sciences. In 1984, \\"Contribution of tabtoxin to the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabac\\" was published in Physiological Plant Pathology (25, 55-69) and \\"Effect of tabtoxin on nitrogen metabolism\\" by J.G. Turner, R.R. Taha & J.M. Debbage was published in Physiologia Plantarum in 1986 (67, 649-653). Taha is married to the British- educated General Amir Mohammad Rashid al-Ubaidi, the former Iraqi oil minister and director of Iraq's Military Industrial Corporation, which was responsible for Saddam's advanced weapons programs. Taha met General Rashid, who has a Ph.D in engineering from the University of Birmingham, when they were both invited to New York City for a meeting with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in 1993. At the time, Taha was in her late 30s, unmarried and without children, a highly unusual situation for an Arab woman. Already married with a six-year-old son, General Rashid took Taha as his second wife when they returned to Baghdad. In 1997, Saddam Hussein awarded Taha a medal of scientific achievement and, prior to the 2003 war on Iraq, broadcasts were aired showing Taha and Saddam sitting next to each other. On 12 May 2003, the U.S. government announced that Taha had surrendered to coalition forces. Work =Growth of biological agents= Although Taha told her fellow students at Norwich that she wanted to return to Iraq to teach biology, she went instead to work for Iraq's germ warfare program. In 1985, she worked in the al-Muthanna chemical plant near Baghdad, and later became chief production officer in al-Hakam (also spelled al-Hakum), Iraq's top-secret biological- warfare facility at the time. During several visits to Iraq by United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities, weapons inspectors were told by Taha that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant. \\"There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,\\" Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, \\"beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.\\" According to the 1999 DIA report, the normally mild- mannered Taha exploded into violent rages when questioned about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, storming out of the room, before returning and smashing a chair. However, in 1995, UNSCOM's principal weapons inspector Rod Barton from Australia showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM from the Israeli government that showed the Iraqi regime had just purchased 10 tons of growth media from a British company called Oxoid. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow; it is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq's hospital consumption of growth media was just 200 kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it. Shown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to the inspectors that her biological weapons agency had grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; Clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the U.S. and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material. =Weaponisation of biological agents= The British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and UNSCOM catalogued the weaponization by Taha's team of biological agents. Above, the SIS building photographed from Vauxhall Bridge Road, London. UNSCOM learned that, In August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Taha's team was ordered to set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. \\"We never intended to use it,\\" she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC's Panorama program. \\"We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody.\\" However, UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near the facility at al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha's team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers. =Missing anthrax= On 18 March 2005, the Associated Press reported that Taha had provided an explanation for the 1,800 gallon discrepancy between the amount of anthrax the UN knew she had manufactured, and the amount she admitted to destroying. The missing anthrax was one of the stated reasons for the Iraq war and was emphasized by then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell during his February 2003 speech to the Security Council. However, according to an Iraq Survey Group report published on 6 October 2004, Taha told American investigators that she and her colleagues dumped the missing anthrax near the gates of one of Saddam's palaces in April 1991, but were afraid to admit to this for fear of incurring Saddam's wrath. The Iraqi biologists therefore told the UN weapons inspectors that the missing anthrax had never existed. =Suspected experimentation on human beings= The inspectors feared that Taha's team had experimented on human beings. During one inspection, they discovered two primate-sized inhalation chambers, one measuring 5 cubic metres, though there was no evidence the Iraqis had used large primates in their experiments. According to former weapons inspector Scott Ritter in his 1999 book Endgame: Solving the Iraq Crisis, UNSCOM learned that, between 1 July and 15 August 1995, 50 prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison were transferred to a military post in al-Haditha, in the northwest of Iraq, (Ritter, 1999). Iraqi opposition groups say that scientists sprayed the prisoners with anthrax, though no evidence was produced to support these allegations. During one experiment, the inspectors were told, 12 prisoners were tied to posts while shells loaded with anthrax were blown up nearby. Ritter's team demanded to see documents from Abu Ghraib prison showing a prisoner count. Ritter writes that they discovered the records for July and August 1995 were missing. Asked to explain the missing documents, the Iraqi government charged that Ritter was working for the CIA and refused to co-operate further with UNSCOM. =Statements to press= In an interview broadcast in February 2003, Taha said Iraq was justified in producing germ weapons in the 1980s and 1990s to defend itself. She told the British Broadcasting Corp. she was involved in producing Iraq's final weapons declaration to the United Nations. She said Saddam's regime was telling the truth when it said it no longer had any chemical or biological weapons. Taha told the BBC her country never planned to use the biological agents it produced in the 1980s and early 1990s. \\"We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody,\\" she said. \\"Iraq has been threatened by different enemies and we are in an area that suffers from regional conflict. I think it is our right to have something to defend ourselves and to have something as a deterrent.\\" Taha and Kenneth Bigley On 18 September 2004, the Tawhid and Jihad (\\"Oneness of God and Holy War\\") Islamist group, led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, kidnapped Americans Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley, and British engineer Kenneth Bigley, threatening to kill them if Iraqi women prisoners were not released. Armstrong and Hensley were killed within the first 72 hours, but Bigley was kept alive for three weeks. The only Iraqi women prisoners being held at that time, according to the British government, were Taha and another woman scientist, Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a bio-tech researcher who was on the U.S. list of the 55 most wanted members of Saddam's regime. It was hoped that the release of these women, who had not been charged with any offense, would trigger the release of Bigley. Iyad Allawi, Iraq's prime minister, refused to sanction Taha's release. On 22 September 2004, Noori Abdul-Rahim Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Iraqi Justice Ministry, said that Taha would be released on bail. He said the decision was not related to Zarqawi's demands, but that the government regularly reviews the cases of prominent detainees, and it was decided to release Taha because she had cooperated with the authorities. However, after a statement from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell that there would be no negotiations with terrorists, Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced that neither Taha nor Ammash would be released in the near future. Bigley was beheaded on 7 October 2004. Taha's release In December 2005, 22 so-called \\"high-value\\" prisoners, including Rihab Taha, were released without charge two days after Iraq's national elections, following over 30 months in confinement. Another female scientist, Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, nicknamed \\"Mrs. Anthrax\\" by the U.S., was also among those released after what the U.S. said was a standardized process of review and an agreement with the interim Iraqi government.

'Transoxiana (also spelled Transoxania), known in Arabic sources as ' (, – '[what is] beyond the [Oxus] river') and in Persian as Farā-rūd (, —'beyond the [Amudarya] river'), is the ancient name used for the portion of Central Asia corresponding approximately with modern- day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan. Geographically, it is the region between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. The area had been known to the ancient Iranians as Turan, a term used in the Persian national epic Shahnameh, and to the Romans as Transoxania (Land beyond the Oxus). The Arabic term Mā warāʼ an-Nahr (Land Beyond the River) passed into Persian literary usage and stayed on until post-Mongol times.C. Edmund Bosworth, (2002), 'CENTRAL ASIA iv.

History A Chinese sancai ceramic statuette depicting a Sogdian stableman, dated to the Tang Dynasty (AD 618–907) The name Transoxiana stuck in Western consciousness because of the exploits of Alexander the Great, who extended Greek culture into the region with his invasion in the 4th century BC. Alexander's successors would go on to found the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, ushering in a distinct Greek cultural presence within Transoxiana that existed for over two hundred years. The city of Ai Khanoum, situated on the Oxus river in northern Afghanistan, remains the only Graeco Bactrian city to have been found and extensively excavated.Rachel Mairs, The Hellenistic Far East During the Sassanid Empire, it was often called Sogdiana, a provincial name taken from the Achaemenid Empire, and used to distinguish it from nearby Bactria. The Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited the neighbouring countries of Bactria and Parthia along with Transoxiana in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on this region. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilisation that farmed grain and grapes, and made silver coins and leather goods.Silk Road, North China, C. Michael Hogan, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007) It was ruled successively by Seleucids, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, the Parthian Empire and the Kushan Empire before Sassanid rule. In Sassanid times, the region became a major cultural center due to the wealth derived from the Northern Silk Road. Sassanid rule was interrupted by the Hephthalite invasion at the end of the 5th century and didn't return to the Sassanids until 565. Many Persian nobles and landlords escaped to this region after the Muslim conquest of Persia. It was also ruled by Göktürks until the Arab conquest between 705 and 715, the area became known as Mā warāʼ al-Nahr (Arabic, 'what is beyond the river'), sometimes rendered as \\"Mavarannahr\\". Transoxiana's major cities and cultural centers are Samarkand and Bukhara. Both are in the southern portion of Transoxiana (though still to the north of the Amu Darya itself, on the river Zeravshan), and the majority of the region was dry but fertile plains. Both cities remained centres of Persian culture and civilisation after the Islamic conquest of Iran, and played a crucial role in the revival of Persian culture with establishment of the Samanid dynasty. Part of this region was conquered by Qutayba ibn Muslim between 706 and 715 and loosely held by the Umayyads from 715 to 738. The conquest was consolidated by Nasr ibn Sayyar between 738 and 740, and continued under the control of the Umayyads until 750, when it was replaced by the Abbasids. The Tang dynasty also controlled the eastern part of the region until about the same time, when a civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion occurred. Genghis Khan, founder of the Mongol Empire, invaded Transoxiana in 1219 during his conquest of Khwarezm. Before his death in 1227, he assigned the lands of Western Central Asia to his second son Chagatai, and this region became known as the Chagatai Khanate. In 1369, Timur, of the Barlas tribe, became the effective ruler and made Samarkand the capital of his future empire. Transoxiana was known to be flourishing in the mid-14th century.The Timurid Empire Religion The historian Mark Dickens notes: Notable people * Abu Mansur al-Maturidi * Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi See also * Sogdiana * Greater Khorasan * Khwarezm * Turan * Hisar-i Shadman References Sources * Category:Geography of Central Asia Category:Historical regions Category:History of Central Asia Category:Regions of Asia Category:Iranian countries and territories ","title":"Transoxiana"},{"id":"33686210","text":"Ludwig Ferdinand Schiedermair (7 December 1876, in Regensburg – 30 April 1957, in Bensberg) was a German minister and musicologist.

It is an important Buddhist pilgrimage site, where Buddhists believe Gautama Buddha attained Parinirvana after his death. It is an international Buddhist pilgrimage centre. The followers of Buddhism, especially from Asian countries, wish to visit this place at least once in their lifetime. Etymology According to one theory, Kushanagar was the capital of Kosala Kingdom and according to Ramayana it was built by King Kush, son of Rama, protagonist of the epic Ramayana. While according to Buddhist tradition Kushavati was named prior to the king Kush. The naming of Kushwati is believed to be due to abundance of Kush grass found in this region. Demographics According to 2011 Indian Census, Kushinagar had a total population of 22,214, of which 11,502 were males and 10,712 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 2,897. The total number of literates in Kushinagar was 15,150, which constituted 68.2% of the population with male literacy of 73.3% and female literacy of 62.7%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Kushinagar was 78.4%, of which male literacy rate was 84.5% and female literacy rate was 71.9%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 1,117 (5.03%) and 531 (2.39%) respectively. Kushinagar had 3462 households in 2011. History The present Kushinagar is identified with Kusavati (in the pre-Buddha period) and Kushinara (in the post-Buddha period). Kushinara was the capital of Mallas which was one of the sixteen mahajanpads of the 6th century BCE. Since then, it remained an integral part of the erstwhile empires of Maurya, Shunga, Kushana, Gupta, Harsha, and Pala dynasties. In the medieval period, Kushinagar had passed under the suzerainty of Kultury Kings. Kushinara continued to be a living city till the 12th century CE and was thereafter lost into oblivion. Padrauna is believed to be ruled over by a Rajput adventurer, Madan Singh, in the 15th century CE. this relief at Sanchi However, modern Kushinagar came into prominence in the 19th century with archaeological excavations carried out by Alexander Cunningham, the first Archeological Surveyor of India and later followed by C.L. Carlleyle who exposed the main stupa and also discovered a 6.10 meters long statue of reclining Buddha in 1876. Excavations continued in the early twentieth century under J. Ph. Vogel. He conducted archaeological campaigns in 1904-5, 1905-6 and 1906-7, uncovering a wealth of Buddhist materials. Chandra Swami, a Burmese monk, came to India in 1903 and made Mahaparinirvana Temple into a living shrine. After independence, Kushinagar remained part of the district of Deoria. On 13 May 1994, it came into being as a new district of Uttar Pradesh. Location of Gautama Buddha's death and parinirvana In 1896, Waddell suggested that the site of the death and parinirvana of Gautama Buddha was in the region of Rampurva.\\"A Tibetan Guide-book to the Lost Sites of the Buddha's Birth and Death\\", L. A. Waddell. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1896, p. 279. However, according to the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, the Buddha made his journey to Kushinagar, died there, and this is where he was cremated. It is believed that during his last day he walked into the groves of trees near the city and rejoiced at the blossoms of sala trees (Shorea robusta) before laying himself to rest. Modern scholarship, based on archaeological evidence, believes that the Buddha died in Kushinagar, close to the modern Kasia (Uttar Pradesh). Ashoka built a stupa and pilgrimage site to mark Buddha's parinirvana in Kushinagara. The Hindu rulers of the Gupta Empire (fourth to seventh century) helped greatly enlarge the Nirvana stupa and Kushinagar site, building a temple with reclining Buddha. This site was abandoned by Buddhist monks around 1200 CE, who fled to escape the invading Muslim army, after which the site decayed during the Islamic rule in India that followed. The British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham rediscovered Kushinagara in the late 19th century, and his colleague A. C. L. Carlleyle unearthed the 1,500-year-old Buddha image. The site has since then become an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists. Archaeological evidence from the 3rd century BCE suggests that the Kushinagara site was an ancient pilgrimage site. Geography Kushinagar is a nagar palika situated at 53 km east from Gorakhpur on the National Highway-28, lying between latitude 26°45´N and 83°24´E. Gorakhpur is the main railway terminus for Kushinagar while air strip of UP Civil Aviation is situated in Kasia, 2 km away from Kushinagar, currently being developed as an International Airport by Uttar Pradesh Government and Government of India. Tourism ;Parinirvana Stupa The Parinirvana Temple with the Parinirvana Stupa, Kushinagar The reclining Nirvana statue of the Buddha is inside the Parinirvana Stupa. The statue is 6.10 metres long and is made of monolith red sandstone. It represents the \\"Dying Buddha\\" reclining on his right side with his face towards the west. It is placed on a large brick pedestal with stone-posts at the corners. ;Nirvana Chaitya (Main Stupa) Nirvana Chaitya]is located just behind the Main Parinirvana Temple. It was excavated by Carlleyle in the year 1876. During excavations, a copper plate was found, which contained the text of the \\"Nidana-Sutra\\" which concluded the statement that plate had been deposited in the Nirvana-Chaitya by one Haribala, who also installed the great Nirvana Statue of Buddha in the temple front. ;Ramabhar Stupa Ramabhar Stupa, also called a Mukutbandhan-Chaitya, is the cremation place of Buddha. This site is 1.5 km east of the main Nirvana Temple on the Kushinagar-Deoria road. ;Matha Kuar Shrine A colossal statue of Lord Buddha is installed, which is carved out of one block which represents Buddha seated under the \\"Bodhi Tree\\" in a pose known as \\"Bhumi Sparsh Mudra\\" (Earth touching attitude). The inscription at the base of statue is datable to the 10th or 11th century A.D. ;Other major places *Indo-Japan-Sri Lanka Temple: Indo-Japan-Sri Lanka temple is a marvel of Buddhist architectural grandeur of modern times. *Wat Thai Temple: It is a huge complex built in a typical Thai-Buddhist architectural fashion. *Ruins and brick structures: These are located around the main Nirvana Temple and Main Stupa.

History The term likely originated in England, where consumers have blended different beers since at least the seventeenth century. The name \\"black and tan\\" had earlier been used to describe the coats of dogs, such as the black and tan coon-hound. The earliest recorded usage of the term in the drink context is from 1881, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, in the American magazine Puck. The first recorded British use of the term to describe a drink is from 1889. Up until the 1980s a version of the black and tan drink was a mix of ale and stout and after it was promoted as a layered drink. The tradition of blending beers can be traced to London during the 1700s where beer blends or “three-threads and “five-threads were consumed. Each thread was a beer type that was blended into a drink. Three threads was a form of mixed beer alehouse's sold to avoid paying a higher tax on beer. By taking a strong beer taxed at a higher rate and mixing it with a small beer taxed at a lower-rate afforded brewers a profit. This practice continued from the late 1690s to 1700s. It is reported and debated that Three-Threads is the reason that Stout and or Porters were developed. Preparation A Black and Tan is prepared by filling a glass halfway with pale ale, then adding stout to fill the glass completely. An upside-down tablespoon may be placed over the glass to avoid splashing and mixing the layers. A specially designed black-and-tan spoon is bent in the middle so that it can balance on the edge of the pint-glass for easier pouring. Alternatively, the stout may be poured first so that the drinks are thoroughly mixed together. The \\"layering\\" of Guinness on top of the pale ale or lager is possible because of the lower relative density of the Guinness. The opposite scenario (where the layer on top is heavier than bottom) would produce a buoyancy instability resulting in the two beers mixing. Several American breweries currently make premixed Black and Tan, for example Yuengling's Original Black and Tan. Controversy The name \\"Black and Tan\\" is not used in Ireland as a term for a mixture of two beers. The drink is instead referred to as a half and half. Indeed, the drink has image problems in Ireland and elsewhere due to the association with the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, nicknamed the \\"Black and Tans\\", which was sent into Ireland in the early 1920s. As a result, in Ireland the name is seen as contentious and disrespectful. In March 2006, Ben and Jerry's released an ice cream flavour in the United States for Saint Patrick's Day inspired by the drink; the name offended Irish nationalists because of the paramilitary association. Ben and Jerry's has since apologised. A spokesman told Reuters, \\"Any reference on our part to the British Army unit was absolutely unintentional and no ill will was ever intended.\\" In March 2012, the drink's name once more came into the news when Nike, as part of an Irish themed set of designs, released a pair of shoes advertised as the \\"Black and Tan\\" and generating offence similar to the earlier Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

Many seed species have an embryonic dormancy phase, and generally will not sprout until this dormancy is broken. The term stratification can be traced back to at least 1664 in Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber, where seeds were layered (stratified) between layers of moist soil and exposing these strata to winter conditions. Thus, stratification became the process by which seeds were artificially exposed to conditions to encourage subsequent germination. Cold stratification Cold stratification is the process of subjecting seeds to both cold and moist conditions. Seeds of many trees, shrubs and perennials require these conditions before germination will ensue. =In the wild= In the wild, seed dormancy is usually overcome by the seed spending time in the ground through a winter period and having its hard seed coat softened by frost and weathering action. By doing so the seed is undergoing a natural form of \\"cold stratification\\" or pretreatment. This cold moist period triggers the seed's embryo; its growth and subsequent expansion eventually break through the softened seed coat in its search for sun and nutrients. =Process= In its most basic form, when the stratification process is controlled, the pretreatment amounts to nothing more than subjecting the seeds to storage in a cool (ideally +1° to +3°C [34 to 37 degrees Fahrenheit] not freezing) and moist environment for a period found to be sufficient for the species in question. This period of time may vary from one to three months. To accomplish this seeds are placed in a sealed plastic bag with moistened vermiculite (or sand or even a moistened paper towel), which is refrigerated. Three times as much vermiculite as seeds is used. It is important to only slightly dampen the vermiculite, as excessive moisture can cause the seeds to mold in the bag. Soaking the seeds in cold water for 6–12 hours immediately before placing them in cold stratification can cut down on the amount of time needed for stratification, as the seed needs to absorb some moisture to enable the chemical changes that take place. After undergoing the recommended period of stratification, the seeds are ready to be removed and sown in the nursery bed for germination. Alternatively, the seed may be sown in small pots filled with moist soil and then the whole thing enclosed inside a plastic bag before placing inside a common refrigerator. =Preparing a stratifying medium= Many sources recommend using peat, a combination of peat and sand, or vermiculite as the medium for cold stratifying seeds. The medium must be sterile to prevent harm to the seed by pathogens including fungi. Preparing the seed The seeds should be cleaned of any additional material (fruit pulp, leaf and seed-pod fragments, cone scales, etc.), but the shells of nuts should not be removed. Warm and cold stratification Any seeds that are indicated as needing a period of warm stratification followed by cold stratification should be subjected to the same measures, but the seeds should additionally be stratified in a warm area first, followed by the cold period in a refrigerator later. Warm stratification requires temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F). In many instances, warm stratification followed by cold stratification requirements can also be met by planting the seeds in summer in a mulched bed for expected germination the following spring. Some seeds may not germinate until the second spring. Use of fungicide Use of a fungicide to moisten the stratifying vermiculite will help prevent fungal diseases. Chinosol (8-quinolyl potassium sulfate) is one such fungicide used to inhibit Botrytis cinerea infections. Different seeds should be placed in different bags rather than putting them all into one bag, and large quantities are also best split into several small bags. That way any fungal outbreak will be restricted to only some seeds. If no fungicide is used, a close check should be kept on the seeds, removing any which show signs of mold or become soft and with a decaying smell. If an outbreak of fungus occurs, remove the seeds and re-apply fungicide, then place them in a new bag with new slightly moistened vermiculite. Always keep the bag sealed. The stratifying seeds should be checked on a regular basis for either fungus or germination. If any seeds germinate while in the refrigerator, they should be removed and sown. Sowing and seedlings The medium/soil is not critical as long as the soil is light as well as lightly firmed down but not heavily compacted. Sterilized potting soil will minimize problems with Botrytis or Pythium fungal disease. These problems are much more likely to occur if air circulation is poor. Most seeds need only be planted at a depth equal to their own thickness in order to germinate. Seeds planted outdoors are best planted a little deeper to avoid disturbance caused by heavy rainfall. The soil should be slightly damp but never soaking wet, nor allowed to dry out completely. Most seedlings, whether grown in pots or beds, benefit from good air circulation which discourages fungus growth and promotes sturdy stems.

When Wi-Fi is unavailable, Republic falls back on its partner T-Mobile's two national GSM and CDMA networks. It is based in Raleigh, North Carolina. They are currently in the beta testing phase for Apple iPhones. History Created in January 2010 as a subsidiary of Bandwidth.com, the company announced it would provide a monthly subscription of $19 per month for wireless service with unlimited calling, texting, and data on a \\"Hybrid Calling\\" system. Republic Wireless began beta service on November 8, 2011 with the LG Optimus S and later the Motorola Defy XT in July 2012. On November 19, 2012, Republic Wireless ended its private beta and transitioned to an open, public beta. On November 14, 2013, Republic officially came out of its Beta testing period and began offering the Moto X for $299 with four new service plans starting at $5 per month. On March 13, 2014, Republic officially announced the release of their next phone, the Motorola Moto G which was be priced at $149 for the 8GB and $179 for the 16GB version. The Moto G was released for sale on April 17, 2014. Unlike Moto X which offered four service plans, Moto G offered only three service plans. (Moto G did not offer the 4G service plan.) On October 15, 2014, Republic released the Motorola Moto E pricing it at $99. On November 26, 2014, Republic announced that they would be offering the 16 GB second generation Moto X for $399 beginning December 10, 2014. In July 2016, Republic added a new line of nine of the leading unlocked Android phones from Samsung, LG, and Huawei, in addition to its already-established Motorola line.David Ranii, \\"Raleigh-based Republic adds cellular network, new phones\\", The News & Observer, May 11, 2016.\\"Coming this July! Get the leading Android™ phones at Republic.\\" Also, the switch was made to new plans on the T-Mobile network, replacing their older plans using the Sprint network. In August 2016, Republic also added a bring-your-own-phone (BYOP) compatibility to its service plans by offering SIM card kit sales in their online store. On December 1, 2016, Republic Wireless announced its spin-off from Bandwidth.com. On December 6, 2017, Republic Wireless announced a new physical product called Relay. This screen-less device uses LTE and WiFi in order to allow communication between it, other relay devices and a companion smartphone app. It also contains a GPS tracker so that those with the companion app are able to know where the user of the device is. Relay became available for ordering May 2018 at the dedicated Relay website.  Hybrid calling  Wi-Fi networks are used as the primary data and connectivity source to the network, while the cellular network is used as a failover if no Wi-Fi networks are in range of the device. The model relies on a proprietary VoIP application for the Android operating system that has the ability to switch quickly between Sprint's CDMA mobile networks, free roaming, and WiFi, depending on which access network is available. Republic Wireless's current Terms of Service allow the company to reduce a user's speed for a billing period if they exceeds 5 GB of data while using cell twice during a six-month period. Effective September 10, 2014, a user also may not exceed more than 25 MB of roaming cellular data usage in any one-month billing cycle. Once they reach the 25 MB threshold, they will have no additional roaming cellular data usage during the remainder of the billing cycle.https://republicwireless.com/legal/terms-and-conditions  Reception  TechCrunch expressed excitement about the announcement and described the plan as potentially disruptive to the wireless markets. The publication described the \\"WiFi first\\" model as an attractive feature because of the prevalence of WiFi access and the superiority of WiFi connections over digital mobile networks, which they expect will improve call reception and clarity. CNet wrote that the low price point would be \\"a home run\\" for parents who are interested in low-cost plans for young children. The Atlantic was more hesitant, acknowledging that the price point would be attractive to some consumers but speculating that the low-cost business model may lead to unreliable service. The magazine also suggested that since Republic Wireless purchases its air time wholesale from Sprint, it is dependent on major telecommunications companies who may be inclined to limit the company's growth to prevent it from becoming too disruptive. PC World questioned Republic Wireless' marketing the plan as \\"unlimited\\" given the expectations that users monitor a \\"Cellular Usage Index\\" and remain within \\"fair use guidelines\\". The magazine faulted the company for advertising unlimited voice and data while simultaneously describing membership as a \\"privilege\\" and reserving the right to terminate users who crossed an undefined \\"fair use threshold\\". MSNBC wrote that coverage will be unlimited on WiFi access but when on the mobile network, consumers will be held to a monthly limit of 550 minutes of voice, 150 SMS, and 300 megabytes of data or face termination of their subscription. In December 2011, Republic Wireless eliminated this fair use threshold. ZDNet gave the company a 9 out of 10 star review in November, 2013 saying \\"You are unlikely to find a phone as capable and priced as low as the Republic Wireless Moto X...the service offerings are fantastic.\\" Republic also received the Laptop Magazine Editor's Choice Award and was cited \\"one of the best bargains in wireless.\\" Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal gave rave reviews to Republic when they came out of Beta testing in November, 2013 saying this was a chance for callers to get \\"a top-tier, current-model smartphone with all the bells and whistles, and pay between $5 and $40 a month for unlimited voice, text and data.\\" Huffington Post said Republic had true \\"stick it to the man potential\\" in a November, 2013 piece.

Enter Republic Wireless.\\" The Art of Being Cheap claims Republic is \\"... Such a better deal than any other phone on the market, that there really are no viable competitors\\" in a November, 2013 piece once the company had come out of Beta. In April 2014, an article in The Wealth Gospel posited that Republic is \\"poised to be a disruptor in the mobile telecommunications market,\\" citing that the company offers customers an opportunity to \\"shrug off the shackles of contracts and high monthly costs.\\" On November 12, 2013, Republic was voted the Lifehacker Most Popular Pre-Paid/MVNO Carrier with 31% of the vote.Republic the Most Popular Pre-Paid Alan Henry Marguerite Reardon of CNET praised Republic's \\"cut-throat pricing\\", especially for consumers who only want voice and text, but faulted unreliable hand-off between Wi-Fi and cellular service, and small variety of available handsets, and said \\"customers who are having problems with the service never actually get to speak to a real human\\".

The pact came into force on January 1, 2004. On that date, tariffs on 90% of U.S. exports to Chile and 95% of Chilean exports to the United States were eliminated. The agreement also established that Chile and the U.S. will establish duty-free trade in all products within a maximum of 12 years (2016).http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reports/2010/NTE/2010_NTE_Chile_final.pdf In 2009, bilateral trade between the United States and Chile reached US$ 15.4 billion, a 141% increase over bilateral trade levels before the U.S.-Chile FTA took effect. In particular, U.S. exports to Chile in 2009 showed a 248% increase over pre-FTA levels. History The first steps toward a trade agreement between the two countries began in 1992 when U.S. President George H. W. Bush agreed with Chile’s President Patricio Aylwin to \\"want to pursue free-trade negotiations as quickly as that is feasible.\\" At the 1994 Summit of the Americas U.S. President Bill Clinton, Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien, and Ernesto Zedillo, the President of Mexico, had agreed to admit Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In February 1997 Chile’s President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle visited the U.S. Congress and declared his support for his country to join NAFTA. However, NAFTA expansion could not be accomplished because the Clinton administration failed to obtain “fast-track” negotiation abilities from the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Chile signed a pact with Canada in 1996 and with Mexico in 1998. On August 1, 2002, the U.S Senate granted fast-track authority to President George W. Bush to negotiate a free trade agreement with Chile and other countries. On December 11, 2002, the U.S Trade Representative Robert Zoellick announced it had reached an FTA agreement with Chile. On January 30, 2003, President Bush notified the U.S Congress of his intention to sign the treaty within 90 days. Negotiations were complicated by Chile's opposition to an imminent U.S. invasion of Iraq. U.S Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stated that both President Bush and the U.S Congress were \\"disappointed\\" by Chile's lack of support in the Iraq war and said there was no set time-frame for a signing of the pact. On April 23, 2003 U.S Secretary of State Colin Powell said the FTA would be signed and approved but they were looking for the appropriate moment to submit it to Congress. On May 7, 2003, President Bush said the \\"important FTA with Chile would go ahead\\". The treaty was finally signed on June 6, 2003, at the Vizcaya Palace in Miami by Chile's Foreign Affairs MInister Soledad Alvear and Zoellick. It was ratified by the U.S. House of Representatives on July 24, 2003, by a vote of 270-156, and ratified by the U.S. Senate on July 31, 2003, by a vote of 65-32. President George W. Bush signed into law the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on September 3, 2003. It was ratified by the Chamber of Deputies of Chile on October 7, 2003, by a vote of 87-8, and ratified by the Senate of Chile on October 22, 2003, by a vote of 34-5. The treaty was promulgated by President Bush on September 3, 2003, and by Chilean President Ricardo Lagos on December 4, 2003. Provisions The text of the Free Trade Agreement is divided into twenty- five sections, listed and summarized as follows: =Preambles= A summary of political goals of the agreement, including “CONTRIBUTE to hemispheric integration and the fulfillment of the objectives of the Free Trade Area of the Americas” =Initial Provisions= Relate objectives of the agreement. =General Definitions= This chapter lays the framework for the FTA and sets definitions to be used throughout the agreement in order to assure uniformity. =National Treatment and Market Access for Goods= Define tariffs and customs general regulation, safeguards, and equivalences of nomenclatures for several goods. Chile eliminate tariffs immediately on pork and pork products, beef offal, durum wheat, barley, barley malt, sorghum, soybeans and soybean meal, pasta, breakfast cereals, cereal preparations, and sunflower seeds. Access for beef on both sides will be liberalized over 4 years, beginning with a 1,000-metric-ton quota, a 10-percent annual growth factor, and a linear phase-out of the out-of-quota tariff rate. Access for poultry on both sides will be completely liberalized over 10 years Chile’s duty on many dairy products, including skim milk powder, whey, and cheeses, will be eliminated in 4 years; duties on other dairy products will be eliminated in 8 years. Tariffs on U.S. and Chilean wines are being progressively harmonized down to the lowest wine tariff rate and will be eliminated by 2016.

Career Paul Chesley was introduced to the art of photography by his father at the age of three when he was given his first camera. He grew up taking pictures on family vacations and developing film in his dad’s darkroom. Chesley’s early work focused on natural subjects and landscapes and in the early 1970s he began taking photography classes at Colorado Mountain College as well as participating in workshops at the Center of the Eye in Aspen, Colorado. Chesley also participated as a student on a National Geographic workshop led by Robert Gilka, the society’s director of photography. Chesley began shooting assignments for National Geographic in 1975 and has since completed more than 35 projects for the society.National Geographic Society  Photographers  Paul Chesley His photography has focused primarily on people and cultures in Oceania, Asia and Europe.Paul Chesley's Asia Pacific Travelogue In 1984, Chesley helped found Photographers/Aspen, a photo collective of four National Geographic photographers. In 1989, Chesley met and became friends with Hunter S. Thompson while producing a story on Aspen for Life magazine. In an interview with Stephen Metcalf for Accent Thai magazine Chesley stated that he doesn’t consider himself a schooled photographer. ‘Almost everything I’ve learned has come from my experience in the field’ he says. According to John Agnone, National Geographic book editor, Chesley '...Takes graphically strong images that communicate the essence of his subjects - and he makes it look easy.' When asked to describe Chesley’s style of photography, Carole Lee a former project coordinator for Chesley stated ‘Paul’s sensitivity captures the gentle spirit in people.’ Fellow Minnesotan and National Geographic photographer Jim Brandenburg said of Paul, 'With so many photographers out there constantly boasting about their work, Paul contradicts the profession. Chesley holds his projects very dear. he goes about his work in a quiet but dignified and steadfast way. And most of all, he lets his work speak for itself.' Recognition Paul Chesley - A Photographic Voyage Chesley's work was included in the National Geographic Society's first major exhibition, The Art of Photography at National Geographic; A 100-Year Retrospective, held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1988. His images have also been exhibited in museums in London, Tokyo, New York, and Honolulu. His photographic essays have been featured regularly in Life, Fortune, GEO, Stern, Newsweek, and Time.National Geographic Society  Photographers  Paul Chesley In 2006 Chesley received a Pele AAF Pele Awards award of excellence for photographs contributed to a public service print project titled Our Liliha.

Teubner Verlag, publisher of Mathematische Annalen. Today, Göttinger Digitalisierungszentrum provides online access to all volumes, while archive.org hosts some particular parts. Overview Walther von Dyck acted as chairman of the commission to publish the encyclopedia. In 1904 he contributed a preparatory report on the publication venture in which the mission statement is given. :The mission was to present a simple and concise exposition, as complete as possible, of the body of contemporary mathematics and its consequences, while indicating with a detailed bibliography the historical development of mathematical methods from the beginning of the nineteenth century. The preparatory report (Einleitender Bericht) serves as the Preface for the EMW. In 1908 von Dyck reported on the project to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome.Walther von Dyck (1908) \\"E m W\\", Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, v 1, pp 123-134 Nominally, Wilhelm Franz Meyer (1856–1934) was the founder president of the project and assembled volume (Band) 1 (in 2 separate books), \\"Arithmetic and Algebra\\", that appeared between 1898 and 1904. D. Selivanov expanded his 20-page article on finite differences in Volume 1, Part 2 into a 92-page monograph published under the title Lehrbuch der Differenzenrechnung. Volume 2 (in 5 separate books), the \\"Analysis\\" series printed between 1900 and 1927 had coeditors Wilhelm Wirtinger and Heinrich Burkhardt. Burkhardt condensed his extensive historical review of mathematical analysis that appeared in the Jahresbericht of the German Mathematical Society for a shorter contribution to the EMW.„Trigonometrische Reihen und Integrale (bis etwa 1850)“ von H. Burkhardt, Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften, 1914 Volume 3 (in 6 separate books) on geometry was edited by Wilhelm Franz Meyer. These articles were published between 1906 and 1932 with the book Differentialgeometrie published in 1927 and the book Spezielle algebraische Flächen in 1932. Significantly, Corrado Segre contributed an article on \\"Higher-dimensional space\\" in 1912 that he updated in 1920. The latter was reviewed by T.R. Hollcroft. Volume 4 (in 4 separate books) of EMW concerned mechanics, and was edited by Felix Klein and . Arnold Sommerfeld edited volume 5 (in 3 separate books) on \\"Physics\\", a series that ran until 1927. Volume 6 consisted of two sections (the geodesy section in 1 book and the astronomy section in 2 separate books): Philipp Furtwängler and E. Weichart coedited \\"Geodesy and Geophysics\\", which ran from 1905 to 1922. Karl Schwarzschild and Samuel Oppenheim coedited \\"Astronomy\\", publishing until 1933. Mentions In 1905 Alfred Bucherer acknowledged the influence of the encyclopedia for establishment of appropriate notation for vector analysis in the second edition of his book: :When I wrote the first edition of this small work, the discussions and deliberations concerning a uniform symbolism for vector analysis were still in flux. Since that time through the adoption of a suitable method of designation by those working on the Encyklopädie an important system of symbolism has been put forward.Alfred Bucherer (1905) Elemente der Vektor-Analysis mit Beispielen aus der theoretischen Physik, second edition, Seite V, quoted on page 230 of A History of Vector Analysis In 1916 George Abram Miller noted:George Abram Miller (1916) Historical Introduction to the Mathematical Literature, pp 63,4, Macmillan Publishers :One of the great advantages of this large encyclopedia is that it tends to avoid duplication by establishing a higher minimum of general mathematical knowledge. ... The vastness of the new [mathematical] literature, combined with the fact that some of the new developments appeared first in somewhat obscure places, has often made it difficult for an author to determine whether his results were new. While some of this difficulty remains, yet the large encyclopedia, in which related important results are carefully associated, tends to reduce the difficulty materially. In his review of the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics, Jean Dieudonné raised the specter of Klein's encyclopedia while denigrating its orientation to applied mathematics and historical documentation: :A tremendous gain of space has been achieved by eliminating much of the discursiveness of the old Encyklopädie; the great majority of its historical information (which would have been a mere duplication); a large amount of results of secondary importance which needlessly cluttered many articles; and finally, all the parts devoted to astronomy, geodesy, mechanics, and physics which had no significant mathematical content. It has thus been possible to compress into about one- tenth of the bulk of the Encyklopädie a more valuable amount of information on a science which certainly at present is ten times more extensive than it was in 1900. Librarian Barbara Kirsch Schaefer wrote:Barbara Kirsch Schaefer (1979) Using the Mathematical Literature: A Practical Guide, p 101, Marcel Dekker :Despite its age it remains a valuable source of reference, for its period of publication spans one of the most fruitful periods of mathematical research. Noted for its comprehensive treatment and well-documented scholarly articles, it is aimed at the specialist. In 1982 a history of aeronautics noted the following: :As organizer and editor of the monumental Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences Including Their Applications, [Klein] compiled a collection of definitive studies that became the standard reference in mathematical physics. Early in the thirty-year enterprise Klein solicited the esteemed Sebastian Finsterwalder, professor of mathematics at the Munich polytechnic (and incidentally, one of Prandtl’s teachers), to write an essay on aerodynamics. This review article is significant in the history of aerodynamics because of its comprehensive scope and because it was submitted in August 1902. The date is more than a year before the Wrights achieved their powered flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and two years before Prandtl introduced his theory of the boundary layer. It is therefore kind of a prenatal record of the science we now call aerodynamics. More to the point, however, it was then a rare compendious account of the state of the art of aerodynamics, a first reference to be found in much subsequent research in the field. Klein’s encyclopedia as a whole, moreover, provided the model for the later publication of Aerodynamic Theory, the six-volume encyclopedia of the science of flight that William F. Durand edited in the mid-1930s…Paul A. Hanle (1982) Bringing Aerodynamics to America, pages 39,40, The MIT Press Ivor Grattan-Guinness observed in 2009:Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2009) Routes of Learning: Highways, Pathways, Byways in the History of Mathematics, pp 44, 45, 90, Johns Hopkins University Press, : Many of the articles were the first of their kind on their topic, and several are still the last or the best. Some of them have excellent information on the deeper historical background. This is especially true of articles on applied mathematics, including engineering, which was stressed in its title. He also wrote, \\"The mathematicians at Berlin, the other main mathematical pole in Germany and a citadel for pure mathematics, were not invited to collaborate on the EMW and are reputed to have sneered at it.\\" In 2013 Umberto Bottazzini and Jeremy Gray published Hidden Harmony in which they examined the history of complex analysis. In the final chapter concerned with textbooks, they used Klein's and Molk's encyclopedia projects§ 10.10: Complex analysis in the German and French Encyclopädie, pages 691 to 759 in Hidden Harmony – Geometric Fantasies, Springer to contrast the approaches in Germany (Weierstrass and Riemann) and France (Cauchy). In 1900 an element of an algebra over a field (usually ℝ or ℂ) was known as a hypercomplex number, exemplified by quaternions ℍ which contributed the dot product and cross product useful in analytic geometry, and the del operator in analysis. Explorative articles on hypercomplex numbers, mentioned by Bottazzini and Gray, written by Eduard Study (1898) and Elie Cartan (1908), served as advertisements to twentieth century algebrists, and they soon retired the term hypercomplex by displaying the structure of algebras. French edition Jules Molk was the editor-in-chief of the Encyclopédie des sciences mathématiques pures et appliquées, the French edition of Klein's encyclopedia. It is a French translation and re-writing published between 1904 and 1916 by Gauthier-Villars (partly in cooperation with B. G. Teubner Verlag). According to Jeanne Peiffer, the \\"French edition is notable because the historical treatment is more extensive, and often more precise (thanks to the collaboration of Tannery and Eneström) than the original German version.\\" (quote from pp. 28–29) Notes References * Hélène Gispert (1999) \\"Les débuts de l'histoire des mathématiques sur les scènes internationales et le cas de l'entreprise encyclopédique de Felix Klein et Jules Molk\\", Historia Mathematica 26(4):344-60\\\\. * Virgil Snyder (1936) Indexing EmW Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society v42.

In the metaphor, first prevalent in the aftermath of World War II, sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of baseball. Baseball has also served as the context for metaphors about sexual roles and identity. Running the bases Among the most commonly used metaphors is the progress of a batter and base- runner in describing levels of physical intimacy (generally from a heterosexual perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of the terms: *Strikeout – a failure to engage in any form of foreplay or other sexual activity; *First base – mouth-to-mouth kissing, especially French kissing; *Second base – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the breasts; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any erogenous zones through the clothes (i.e., not actually touching the skin); *Third base – touching below the waist (without sexual intercourse) or manual stimulation of the genitals; in some contexts, it may instead refer to oral stimulation of the genitals; *Home run (home base or scoring) – \\"full\\" (penetrative) sexual intercourse The metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one well-known example in the Meat Loaf song \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\", which describes a young couple \\"making out\\", with a voice-over commentary of a portion of a baseball game, as a metaphor for the couple's activities. A similar example can be found in Billy Joel's song \\"Zanzibar\\" in which he compares himself to Pete Rose and sings the lines, \\"Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd steal it if she only gave the sign. She's gonna give the go ahead, the inning isn't over yet for me.\\" Trace Adkins's 2006 song \\"Swing\\" is based on the same concept. Baseball positions are used as a coded reference to the roles played by men who have sex with men: *Pitcher – the penetrative partner in anal sex *Catcher – the receptive partner in anal sex Similar metaphors for sexual identity include: *Switch hitter – a bisexual individual, referencing a player who can bat from either side *Playing for the other team also Batting for the other team – indicating a person is gay or lesbian *Playing for both teams – indicating a person is bisexual Views The sequence of \\"running the bases\\" is often regarded as a script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on safe sex to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the \\"home run\\" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and Rissel conversely state that \\"third base\\" is now sometimes considered to comprise oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor to \\"full\\" (i.e. penetrative) sex. The use of baseball as a sexual script in general, regardless of what each base signifies, has been critiqued by sexuality educators for misrepresenting sex as a contest with a winner and loser. Deborah Roffman writes that the baseball metaphor has been an \\"insidiously powerful, singularly effective, and very efficient…as a vehicle for transmitting and transferring to successive generations of young people all that is wrong and unhealthy about American sexual attitudes.\\" There are conflicting perspectives on the use of the baseball metaphor as a part of sex education. Some educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective instructional tool when providing sex education to middle school students. Supporters of baseball metaphors in sex education include Leman and Bell. In their book A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex, they use a baseball metaphor to aid parents in the discussion of puberty with their children, dividing the topics into \\"first base\\" (\\"Changes from the neck up\\"), \\"second base\\" (\\"Changes from the neck to the waist\\"), \\"third base\\" (\\"Changes from the waist down\\"), and \\"home plate\\" (\\"The Big 'It'\\"). Others argue that the baseball metaphor reflects U.S. ideas about sex as a contest to be won, rather than a mutual and consensual activity. These critiques suggest that other metaphors might be more useful for explaining sexual consent and pleasure. Alternative metaphors and a critique of the baseball metaphor are offered in the sex education materials provided by Scarleteen.

The boat design was later called a packet (or mail) boat, because its use was that of running the first Parramatta River trade ferry, passenger, cargo, and mail service between the Sydney Cove and the Rose Hill (Parramatta) First Fleet settlements after she was launched in Sydney Cove in September and commissioned on 5 October 1789. She was the first purpose-built sailing vessel constructed in Australia. Authorising construction Governor Arthur Phillip had appointed a midshipman, Henry Brewer, as temporary superintendent of building works in the colony seven years before. In 1796, Governor John Hunter would establish a government shipyard in Sydney Town. The craft was laid down on 30 December 1788Samuel Bennett, The history of Australian discovery and colonisation, p.140 on King's Slipway, later the James Underwood yards on the east side of Sydney Cove, somewhere near the site of the present Customs House, by convicts under supervision of Robinson Reid, a carpenter from . Construction resource problems Fourteen ship's carpenters are known to have been sailing with the First Fleet ships, so the selection of Reed as the builder was unlikely to have been accidental.Fellowship of the First Fleeters Unfortunately the quality of local timber left few options for the construction, and \\"From the quantity of wood used, she appeared to be a 'mere bed of timber.\\" What made construction difficult was the lack of specialised shipbuilding tools, and many of the carpentry tools intended for use in the cutting and shaping of the European timbers turned out to be unsuitable for the task mainly due to the density of the local hardwood timber.Tuckey's observations on the various kinds of timber found in New South Wales in 1804 Although there were sixteen ship's carpenters in the colony, of the convicts used in the building of the packet only twelve were trained as carpenters. All these factors forced excessive use of timber. =Australian timbers in early shipbuilding attempts= The difficulties in constructing Rose Hill Packet lay with the type of timber readily available in the Sydney area, the Sydney red gum. Some trees were or more high with no lateral branches until . Their girth could measure in excess of in diameter, but the trunks were hollow and rotten in eleven out of a dozen felled trees. Cox and Freeland describe the species as, \\"almost without exception, they rot out at the heart before they are any useful size leaving a mere shell of living sound wood.\\"Cox, P. & Freeland, J. Rude Timber Buildings in Australia. Thames and Hudson. London. 1969. pp.9-27 It was found that no matter in what way it was sawn or how well it was dried, that when placed in water \\"it sinks to the bottom like a stone.\\" John White, Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, 1787-1788 Members of the First Fleet soon realised that, \\"despite their amazing size the trees were scarcely worth cutting down.\\"ibid. Several years later, George Thompson summed up Australian timber as \\"of little use - not fit for building either houses or boats.\\"H.R.N.S.W. (Historical Records of New South Wales). [1893]. Lansdown Slattery & Company. Sydney. (1978) Volume 1, p.128 & volume 2, p.799 It wasn't until later that Australian settlers found that the most useful timbers for boat and ship building were the Eucalypts species: iron bark, stringy bark, box and the blackbutt, the bluegum, and turpentine. Consequently, the axes, saws and chisels used by carpenters broke or became blunt with the unfamiliar timber which only much later was discovered to have a density three times that of the European Oak.Archer, J. Building a Nation; A History of the Australian House. Collins. Sydney. 1987. pp. 6-16, 25 To add to their woes, the red gum began to split and warp almost as soon as it was cut, making the usual seasoning impossible, and forcing the use of green timber. However, the same timber after being seasoned for 15 years was reportedly very strong and suitable by the time the colony's first three-masted ship King George was being built. Craft design Reid called the craft a 20-ton (about 15.9m3) launch, a term appropriate for the Royal Navy service, which would produce a craft, larger than any fleet ships could have carried on board to the new colony. No plans or illustrations survive. Several contemporary accounts reported her to be 10 or 12 ton, or alternatively the size of a small hoy- decked boat, which in England were commonly sloop-rigged, designed for inshore work. She carried a single mast, and was also provided with oars, reportedly requiring occasional use of poles due to her \\"heaviness\\", however this refers to a vessel's handling during sailing, not physical weight. The naming confusion perhaps stemms from the variety of coastal craft used in Britain at the time: the English Cutter of the late 18th century, the Margate hoy used for Channel crossing, the Leith sloop, and the English Channel packet-boat. However, the description closely matches the Southampton fishing hoys, with \\"heavy\\", i.e. nearly vertical, stem and stern posts, larger than expected beams and rounded mid-ship sections. The clinker-builtMike Smylie, Traditional Fishing Boats of Britain & Ireland, Amberley Publishing Limited, 2012 Southampton fishing hoys carried the smack or cutter rigs rather than the sloop rigs of the south-eastern English coast (Dover & Thames) hoys.E. W. White, British Fishing-Boats and Coastal Craft, H.M.S.O., London, 1950 David Steel's The Elements and Practice of Naval Architecture. Illustrated with a series of Thirty-Eight Large Draughts and Numerous Smaller Engravings, 1805 illustrates a 13-ton hoy of this type on Plate XXVIII. The reason for the design and rig differences are suggested by the need to navigate the Solent within the proximity of the Isle of Wight with its Eastern Solent, Portsmouth road, Bramble Bank, Bembridge Ledges, and Needles Channel hazards. It is then understandable where the design came from since the First Fleet set sail from Portsmouth, 19 miles (31 km) south east of Southampton. When launched, was named by the convicts, Rose Hill Packet, but afterwards, was appropriately known by the name of 'The Lump'.T. Cadell and W. Davies, An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales: From Its First Settlement in January 1788, to August 1801, 1804, pp.70-71 Craft's performance Despite the colloquial name given to the Packet, it did not necessarily refer to the 'ugliness' of construction, or the lack of construction skills, but the actual design shape produced by the stem and stern rakes, because in use she was \\"...going up with the tide of flood, at the top of high water, she passed very well over the flats at the upper part of the (Parramatta river) harbour.\\"ibid. Reports suggest she could carry up to thirty passengers on deck. Because of the amount of timber used, the craft's performance was considered sluggish, and she was an awkward looking row-and-sail boat. As much as the service was useful to the settlers, the craft lacked durability due to use of green timber, and was difficult in operating, sometimes even requiring the passengers to assist in rowing. Other lighter sailing craft and rowing boats were soon brought into service as ferries across the Harbour to Manly Cove and up and down the river. The packet service was discontinued by 1800.

The youngest of five sons born to Lawrence Brockett and Anne Clarke, Lawrence inherited from his parents Headlam Hall, a country house near Gainford, County Durham. The house was originally built by Henry Birkbeck, Lawrence’s maternal great great grandfather. Brockett matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1743 from Scorton Grammar School, graduating BA in 1747 and becoming a fellow of Trinity in 1749.

Stuart had been tutor to King George III, and was from May 1762 to April 1763 his first appointment as prime minister.

Ancient texts differed on which character to use. (? - 506 BC) was a general of the State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. He was a great-grandson of King Zhuang of Chu. Killing of Fei Wuji Lüshi Chunqiu, a Chinese classic text compiled around 239 BC, credits Shen Yin Shu with getting rid of the corrupt official Fei Wuji. During the reign of King Ping of Chu, Fei Wuji induced the king to marry the bride of the crown prince Jian. Fearing the revenge of the prince when he became king, Fei persuaded King Ping to kill Prince Jian, his tutor Wu She, and Wu She's sons. Prince Jian managed to escape abroad, and Wu She's second son Wu Zixu also escaped to the state of Wu, but Wu She and his first son Wu Shang were executed. Fei Wuji then framed another official Xi Wan () and tricked the prime minister Nang Wa (also known as Zichang) into killing him. Shen Yin Shu, who had risen to the position of Sima (chief commander of the army), pointed out Nang's mistake and persuaded him to execute the hated Fei Wuji. Battle of Boju Chinese states, 5th century BC Zuo Zhuan, one of the earliest Chinese works of narrative history compiled in the 4th century BC, gives a detailed account of Shen Yin Shu's words and deeds in the historic Battle of Boju. In 506 BC, during the reign of King Zhao of Chu, King Helü of Wu led an army to invade Chu. His army was commanded by the military strategist Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War, as well as Wu Zixu, out to avenge the death of his father and brother. The Wu army sailed up the Huai River and then left their ships and marched to the east bank of the Han River. In response, prime minister Nang Wa (Zichang) and Shen Yin Shu led the Chu army to the west bank of the Han, across the river from the invaders. Shen Yin Shu devised a plan in which Nang Wa would take up defensive positions with the main army along the Han River, while Shen would go north to Fangcheng on Chu's northern frontier, and lead the troops stationed there to destroy the Wu ships left on the Huai River and block the three passes on the Wu army's return route. Nang Wa would then cross the Han and the two forces would simultaneously attack the Wu army from both the front and the back. Nang accepted the plan, and Shen departed for Fangcheng. After Shen's departure, however, the historiographer Shi Huang () said to Nang Wa that the people of Chu hated Nang and loved Shen Yin Shu, and that if he followed Shen's plan then Shen would take all the credit for the victory and Nang would be doomed. Nang had a change of heart and decided to cross the river and attack right away. The two armies fought three battles between the Xiaobie (southeast of present-day Hanchuan) and Dabie Mountains and the Wu were victorious. Convinced that he could not win, Nang Wa wanted to flee but was dissuaded by Shi Huang. The Wu army then attacked at Boju, routing the Chu army. Shi Huang was killed in the battle and Nang Wa escaped to the state of Zheng. The Wu army then pursued the remaining Chu troops, won five more battles, and captured Ying, the capital of Chu. Shen Yin Shu had by now returned and defeated the Wu forces at Yongshi River (雍澨, present-day Sima River in Jingshan County), but he was wounded three times in as many battles. Not wanting to be captured alive, he asked officer Wu Goubi to kill him and bring his head home. Zuo Zhuan also mentions that after the fall of Ying, Shen Yin Shu's wife was taken as prisoner to Wu. One of their sons, Shen Houzang, went to Wu but was unable to bring her back. Legacy After the war King Zhao enfeoffed Shen Yin Shu's son Shen Zhuliang with the city of Ye (in present-day Ye County of Henan Province) at the northern frontier of the Chu kingdom. In 478 BC, during the reign of King Hui of Chu, Shen Zhuliang put down the rebellion of Duke of Bai and restored the king's rule. He was awarded the title Ye Gong (Duke of Ye), and became the founding ancestor of the Ye surname. Shen Yin Shu is therefore recognized as an original ancestor of both Shen and Ye, which are now the 49th and 42nd most common Chinese surnames, respectively. Although the Battle of Boju is best known today as the greatest victory of Sun Tzu and Wu Zixu, two of the most famous generals in Chinese history, ancient historians portrayed Shen Yin Shu as a capable general and a worthy adversary. His deeds and especially his death have been dramatized in several historical novels.

Vegetarian, as well as meat and seafood (coastal areas), feature prominently on the menus. Pappu, tomato, gongura, and tamarind are largely used for cooking curries. Spicy and hot varieties of pickles form an important part of Telugu cuisine. Regional variations There are many regional variations due to topographic differences in Telugu-speaking populations spread over a large area.

He is a saint of the Catholic Church and the patron saint for teachers of youth. He is referred to both as La Salle and as De La Salle. La Salle dedicated much of his life to the education of poor children in France; in doing so, he started many lasting educational practices. He is considered the founder of the first Catholic schools. Background La Salle was born to a wealthy family in Rheims, France on April 30, in 1651. He was the oldest child of Louis de La Salle and Nicolle Moet de Brouillet. Nicolle's family was a noble one and ran a successful winery business and she was a relative of Claude Moët, founder of Moët & Chandon.Van Grieken, G. (1995). To Touch Hearts - Pedagogical Spirituality and St. John Baptist de La Salle (Doctoral dissertation). Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. La Salle received the tonsure at age eleven and was named canon of Rheims Cathedral when he was sixteen.\\"St. John Baptist de La Salle\\", La Salle.org He was sent to the College des Bons Enfants, where he pursued higher studies and, on July 10, 1669, he took the degree of Master of Arts. When De La Salle had completed his classical, literary, and philosophical courses, he was sent to Paris to enter the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice on October 18, 1670. His mother died on July 19, 1671, and on April 9, 1672, his father died. This circumstance obliged him to leave Saint-Sulpice on April 19, 1672. He was now twenty-one, the head of the family, and as such had the responsibility of educating his four brothers and two sisters. He completed his theological studies and was ordained to the priesthood at the age of 26 on April 9, 1678. Two years later he received a doctorate in theology. Sisters of the Child Jesus The Sisters of the Child Jesus were a new religious congregation whose work was the care of the sick and education of poor girls. The young priest had helped them in becoming established, and then served as their chaplain and confessor. It was through his work with the Sisters that in 1679 he met Adrian Nyel. With De La Salle's help, a school was soon opened. Shortly thereafter, a wealthy woman in Rheims told Nyel that she also would endow a school, but only if La Salle would help. What began as an effort to help Adrian Nyel establish a school for the poor in La Salle's home town gradually became his life's work.Wanner, R., Claude Fleury (1640-1723) as an Educational Historiographer 1975 \\"No survey of French education in the seventeenth century would be complete without reference to the educational work of Jean-Baptiste de La Salle.\\" Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools Statue in the Church of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, Paris, France At that time, most children had little hope for social and economic advancement. Jean Baptiste de La Salle believed that education gave hope and opportunity for people to lead better lives of dignity and freedom. Moved by the plight of the poor who seemed so \\"far from salvation\\" either in this world or the next, he determined to put his own talents and advanced education at the service of the children \\"often left to themselves and badly brought up\\". La Salle knew that the teachers in Reims were struggling, lacking leadership, purpose, and training, and he found himself taking increasingly deliberate steps to help this small group of men with their work. First, in 1680, he invited them to take their meals in his home, as much to teach them table manners as to inspire and instruct them in their work. This crossing of social boundaries was one that his relatives found difficult to bear. In 1681, De La Salle realized that he would have to take a further step – he brought the teachers into his own home to live with him. De La Salle's relatives were deeply disturbed, his social class was scandalized. When, a year later, his family home was lost at auction because of a family lawsuit, De La Salle rented a house into which he and the handful of teachers moved.\\"John Baptist de La Salle: His Life and Times\\", Signs of Faith, Winter 2000, De La Salle Institute La Salle decided to resign his canonry to devote his full attention to the establishment of schools and the training of teachers. He had inherited a considerable fortune, and this might have been used to further his aims, but on the advice of a Father Barre of Paris, he sold what he had and sent the money to the poor of the province of Champagne, where a famine was causing great hardship.\\"St. John Baptist de La Salle\\", Lives of Saints, John J.

La Salle thereby began a new religious institute, the first one with no priests, at all, among its members: the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, also known as the De La Salle Brothers (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Australasia, and Asia) or, most commonly in the United States, the Christian Brothers. (They are sometimes confused with a different congregation of the same name founded by Edmund Ignatius Rice in Ireland, who are known in the U.S. as the Irish Christian Brothers.) The De La Salle Brothers were the first Roman Catholic teaching religious institute that did not include any priests. One decision led to another until La Salle found himself doing something that he had never anticipated. La Salle wrote: La Salle's enterprise met opposition from the ecclesiastical authorities who resisted the creation of a new form of religious life, a community of consecrated laymen to conduct free schools \\"together and by association\\". The educational establishment resented his innovative methods. Nevertheless, La Salle and his small group of free teachers set up the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools which is, according to the La Salle Web site, entirely dedicated to the Christian education of the \\"children of artisans and the poor\\", in a life close to that of the Catholic religious. In 1685, La Salle founded what is generally considered the first normal school -- that is, a school whose purpose is to train teachers -- in Rheims, France.. Archived from the original on October 29, 2013. Worn out by austerities and exhausting labors, La Salle died at Saint Yon, near Rouen, early in 1719 on Good Friday, only three weeks before his 68th birthday.\\"Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle\\", nominis.cef Veneration Relics of John Baptist de La Salle in the Casa Generaliza in Rome, Italy Pope Leo XIII canonized La Salle on May 24, 1900 and Pope Pius X inserted his feast in the General Roman Calendar in 1904 for celebration on 15 May. Because of his life and inspirational writings, Pope Pius XII proclaimed him Patron Saint of All Teachers of Youth on May 15, 1950. In the 1969 revision of the Church calendar, Pope Paul VI moved his feast day to April 7, the day of his death or \\"birth to heaven\\", his dies natalis. Legacy Statue of Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, De La Salle University, Philippines La Salle was a pioneer in programs for training lay teachers. Of his writings on education, Matthew Arnold remarked: \\"Later works on the same subject have little improved the precepts, while they entirely lack the unction.\\" His educational innovations include Sunday courses for working young men, one of the first institutions in France for the care of delinquents, technical schools, and secondary schools for modern languages, arts, and sciences. The LaSalle University says that his writings influenced educational practice, school management, and teacher preparation for more than 300 years.\\"History\\", La Salle University about 4,200 brothers and 69,000 lay and religious colleagues worldwide were serving as teachers, counselors, and guides to 1,000,000 students in over 1,500 Lasallian educational institutions in 82 countries. Hundreds of educational institutions around the world are named after La Salle. The De La Salle schools form a 300-year-old network in 80 countries following La Salle's principles. A number of streets are named after De La Salle, often near to a Lasallian School.

Its capital is Vitória, and its largest city is Serra. With an extensive coastline, the state hosts some of the country's main ports, and its beaches are significant tourist attractions. The capital, Vitória, is located on an island, next to Guarapari, which constitutes the state's main metro area. In the northern extremes of Espírito Santo is Itaúnas, in the municipality of Conceição da Barra, which is a tourist location known for its sand dunes and forró tradition. The Captaincy of Espírito Santo was carved out of the Captaincy of Bahia in the 18th century, during the colonial rule of Brazil, and named after a 16th century captaincy covering roughly the same area of coast. Following the elevation of Brazil to a constituent kingdom of United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in 1815, prompted by the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, Espírito Santo was elevated to a province. After the independence of Brazil in 1822, it became a province of the newly-established Empire of Brazil, and after Brazil became a republic in 1889, it was granted statehood. In the early 20th century, its current state symbols were adopted. Etymology Espírito Santo's namesake is the Christian Holy Ghost (also known as the Holy Spirit). Demonym There is debate as to the origin of the term capixaba, the unofficial demonym for those born in Espírito Santo. \\"Capixaba\\" is Tupi for \\"corn hair\\", reportedly because the blond hair of the European settlers reminded the Amerindian natives of the golden color of corn. A more mainstream explanation is that the name is a metaphor for a corn-grower; Vitória Island is known to have been full of corn plantations in the early centuries of Portuguese rule in Brazil. A third etymology is from the name of a local tribe, borrowed by the Portuguese during the colonial period. Originally, \\"capixaba\\" referred only to people from Vitória, but in common parlance it eventually came to refer to those born anywhere in the state. The official state demonym, however, is \\"espírito- santense\\". History Vila Velha is the second most populous municipality in the state. Espírito Santo was first inhabited by Amerindians, whose different tribes were usually semi-nomadic, but there is no recorded history of pre- colonial Brazil. The area was colonized by the Portuguese starting in the 16th century, and received African slaves and, later, European immigrants of various origins. =Colonial era and Empire of Brazil= The Captaincy of Espírito Santo, a hereditary fief, was granted to Vasco Coutinho by Manuel I of Portugal around three decades after the Portuguese first landed in Brazil in 1500. He arrived at the captaincy to serve his term on May 23, 1535, bringing a retinue of 60 soldiers, colonists, slaves and servants. They settled on Vitória Island and around the Bay of Vitória. The capital was at first established in Vila Velha, but due to frequent raids by Amerindians, it was moved to the current capital of Vitória, founded on September 8, 1551, on an island near Vila Velha, which was later named Vitória Island. In 1556, after the arrival of European missionaries, the cities Serra, Nova Almeida and Santa Cruz were founded. Carlos Gomes Theatre, in Vitória. Guarapari. The captaincy remained under the influence of Coutinho's family for 140 years. It was elevated to province status in 1821, following the 1815 elevation of Brazil to a constituent kingdom of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, prompted by the 1808 transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil. The Portuguese court were fleeing the Napoleonic Invasion of Portugal (1807). After the Independence of Brazil in 1822, Espírito Santo's provincial status was kept, and it was headed by an appointed provincial president. Emperor Pedro II, who was on good terms with the provincial President, visited the Espírito Santo in 1860, during one of his tours of Brazil. =Modern history= In 1889, with the advent of the First Brazilian Republic, Espírito Santo was made one of the states of Brazil. Afonso Cláudio de Freitas Rosa was appointed the first governor of the State by the provisional government. He was followed by four other appointed governors (José Horácio Costa, Constante Gomes Sodré, Henrique da Silva Coutinho and Antônio Gomez Aguirre) until the first elected governor of Espírito Santo, Alfeu Adolfo Monjardim de Andrade e Almeida, was inaugurated on June 7, 1891. During the Vargas Era, state governors were indirectly elected by Congress. A short period of democracy existed during the Second Brazilian Republic; Carlos Monteiro Lindenberg was elected governor. However, after the 1964 coup d'état, governors were once again chosen by the national assembly. After Cristiano Dias Lopes, Arthur Carlos Gerhard Santos, Élcio Álvares and Eurico Rezende were chosen in this fashion, the military government slowly redemocratized, culminating in the adoption of Brazil's current 1988 Constitution. Democratic elections were held for the filling of every term, up to the incumbent, Renato Casagrande. Economy During the first three centuries of Portuguese colonialism, the main cash crop was sugarcane, until coffee, in high demand in Europe, overtook it in the mid 19th century. During the colonial era, there were periods of gold rush when agriculture was neglected, leading to food shortages, but not much gold was found in Espírito Santo as in the neighbouring states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Another reason for the subdued expansion was the colonial administration's prohibition of the laying roads leading into Minas Gerais, as it was feared gold would be smuggled through the state. Geography Geography of Espírito Santo. With , it is about the size of Estonia, or half the size of Portugal, and has a variety of habitats including coastal planes, lakes, mountainous forests, mangroves and many others. The volcanic islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz, east of Vitória in the southern Atlantic Ocean, are part of Espírito Santo. =Location= Climate of Espírito Santo. This Brazilian state is in the east of the southeastern subdivision of Brazil, which also contains the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean (E), the state of Bahia (N), the state of Minas Gerais (N and W), and the state of Rio de Janeiro (S). Espírito Santo's main cities (outside of the Greater Vitória region) are Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Colatina, Linhares, São Mateus and Aracruz. =Rivers= The main river serving the state is the Doce (English: Sweet River). Other important river basins include the Santa Maria River Basin, the northern branch of the inlets flowing into the sea near Vitória, and the Jucu River Basin, which flows into the sea at roughly the same place, but corresponds to the southern branch. =Climate= Espírito Santo's climate is tropical along the coast, with dry winters and rainy summers. North of Doce River is generally drier and also hot. In the mountainous regions in the south and southwest of the state, the tropical climate is strongly influenced by altitude, and the average temperatures are lower. =Lakes= Espírito Santos's beaches in Guarapari One of the most important lake districts in Brazil lies on the banks of the Doce River. The area contains some 26 large lakes, the biggest of which is called Juparanã Lake. =Topography= The state can be divided into two areas: the low lying coastline and the highland area known as Serra (where one can find the 2,890 meter tall Pico da Bandeira), which is part of the larger Serra do Caparaó range. Demographics Beach of Canto, a rich neighborhood of Vitória. According to the IBGE as of 2012, there were 3,637,000 people residing in the state. The 2012 National Research by Household Sample census revealed the following numbers: 1,835,000 White (50.45%), 1,448,000 Brown (Multiracial) (39.81%), 336,000 Black (9.25%), 7,000 Asian (0.19%), 11,000 Indigenous (0.30%). The population density was . Urbanization: 82.2% (2006); Population growth: 2% (1991–2000); Houses: 1,056,000 (2006).Source: PNAD. =Culture= The pre-colonial Amerindians groups in Espírito Santo were the Tupiniquim, the Temininó, the Aymoré, the Puri and the Botocudo. They have largely been absorbed into the Portuguese-Brazilian civilization, and few live in reservations or tribes. Especially in the 16th century, a number of towns in Espírito Santo were founded with primarily Amerindian populations converted to Catholicism, such as Serra and Santa Cruz. Amerindian food has left its legacy in capixaba culture; the fish-based moqueca capixaba is the state dish, among other local typical seafood dishes. Technically from the region that is now Syria and Lebanon, they came to the state fleeing World War I. As at the time they were Ottoman Empire citizens, they were commonly called 'Turcos' (Turks). Large communities were established in the southern part of the state. Now their descendants control a good share of the local commerce. The Arab- Brazilians of Espírito Santo are generally Maronite Christians. 60-75% of the population of Espírito Santo have Italian ancestry, making it the state with the highest percentage of Italian descendants in Brazil.José Carlos Mattedi. Consulado italiano vai abrir dois escritórios em Vitória para agilizar pedidos de cidadania (in Portuguese) Nara Saletto. Sobre a composição étnica da população capixaba (in Portuguese) They founded many towns in the area and have significant influence on Capixaba society. There are still a number of traditional Italian dance groups in the state and Italian culture festivals, such as the one held in Venda Nova do Imigrante. Italian food is also an important part of Capixaba cuisine. Italian pasta and cheeses, like mozzarella, are produced locally. Small scale farming, which is turning increasingly towards agrotourism, is appealing to its Italian roots to exploit that market. Germans were among the first colonists to cultivate land away from the coastal zone and were a strong influence. The first German settlement, Santa Isabel, was founded in 1844, and still stands. Like today's Capixaba Italian community, they still hold on to many aspects of their ancestors' homeland's culture, as represented in festivals such as the Sommerfest in Domingos Martins. Domingos Martins also hosts a Colonization Museum, where one can find old photos, artifacts and documents pertaining to that settlement movement. Espírito Santo is home to the biggest community of East Pomeranian speakers in the world. More than a century after arriving to Espírito Santo, the East Pomeranian continues to be spoken and remains an important part of Espírito Santo's heritage for many people. To this day they continue centuries old customs within their communities. The first African slaves in Espírito Santo arrived in Vitória in 1609; and years of slavery ensued. However, Espírito Santo was still to play a significant part in the Brazilian abolitionist movement in the guise of the Espírito Santo's slave rebellion of 1848-1849, which demanded intervention of imperial troops. Slavery started losing its economic importance in Espírito Santo after that event. It's difficult to pin down the exact numbers of immigrants of each of these groups to Espírito Santo because they usually arrived under a common Austrian-Hungarian passport, or, in the case of the Tyroleans, under a Swiss or Italian passport. Tyrolean settlers were both of German and Italian language and concentrated in the region of Santa Leopoldina and Santa Teresa. Romanians (especially from Transylvania and Bukovina) and Roma usually arrived under Austrian passports. Large groups of Romani people settled in Espírito Santo's countryside in the late 19th century. Economy Coffea canephora in Timbuí The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 50%, followed by the industrial sector at 44%. Agriculture represents 5% of GDP (2004). Espírito Santo's exports: manufacturing of iron and steel 35.8%, iron ore 25.2%, paper 17.6%, coffee 7.7%, granite 6.5% (2002). Espírito Santo is Brazil's highest steel-producing state. The main crops grown are coffee, sugarcane and fruits (mostly coconut, bananas and papayas). The livestock industry is represented primarily by cattle raised for milk and beef. Industry consists mainly of canning, forestry, textiles, iron and steel works. The latter two are concentrated around Cariacica and the Vale do Rio Doce ironworks. Vitória is an important port for the exporting of iron and steel; the state is among the biggest steel-producing regions the world. In São Mateus, petroleum reserves have been found on the continental shelf, and are being commercially exploited. In agricultural production, coffee, sugarcane, papaya, banana and coconut stands out. It also produces cassava, orange, and beans. In 2020, Espírito Santo was the largest producer of Coffea canephora in Brazil, with a 66.3% share of the total (564.5 thousand tons, or 9.4 million 60 kg bags). In 2017, Minas accounted for 54.3% of the total national coffee production (1st place), Espírito Santo accounted for 19.7% (second place) and São Paulo, 9.8% (third place).IBGE prevê safra recorde de grãos em 2020A Reivenção da cafeicultura no Paraná Brazil is the world's biggest productor of sugarcane, with 672 million tons/year.

Produção de coco no Brasil In 2018 the state also produced cassava, in a small amount compared to Brazilian production: 115 thousand tons, with the country producing 17 million tons.Produção brasileira de mandioca em 2018 Espírito Santo had an orange production of around 18 thousand tons in 2018, the country's 14th largest producer state. Produção brasileira de laranja em 2018 In the north of the state, beef cattle are raised and fattened, and there the meat industry was developed, whose meat is mainly shipped to Rio de Janeiro, in addition to supplying the region of Vitória. In the south, dairy farming is practiced, and milk is sold, through cooperatives, in the markets of Rio de Janeiro and Vitória. More recently developed are silviculture and fruit growing, with use for canned fruit and for cellulose production. The total number of chickens in the state is approximately 9.2 million birds, and that of cattle exceeds 1.8 million heads. There are important reserves of granite and an incipient extraction of natural gas and oil. Sands and marbles are also important products of Espírito Santo extractivism. The state's subsoil is rich in minerals, including oil. There are considerable reserves of limestone, marble, manganese, ilmenite, bauxite, zirconium, monazites and rare earths, although not all are being explored. In mineral extraction, there is exploration, in the Cachoeiro de Itapemirim area, of reserves of marbles, limestone and dolomite. Although relatively small, the industrial park in Espírito Santo is home to chemical, metallurgical, food and paper and cellulose industries. Oil extraction in São Mateus Factory of Garoto Chocolates in Vila Velha Eucalyptus from Aracruz Celulose in the city of Aracruz Port of Tubarão, in the city of Vitória About industry, Espírito Santo in 2017 had an industrial GDP of R$ 21.3 billion, equivalent to 1.8% of the national industry. It employs 168,357 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Extraction of Oil and Natural Gas (23.0%), Construction (20.5%), Industrial Services of Public Utility, such as Electricity and Water (12.3%), Metallurgy (7.5 %) and Pulp and Paper (6.6%). These 5 sectors concentrate 69.9% of the state's industry. Espírito Santo Industry Profile In 2012, the export basket of Espírito Santo was based on iron ore (52.49%), crude oil (10.87%), chemical pulp made of soda or sulphate wood (10.01%), stone or construction (5.58%) and coffee (4.42%). Espírito Santo exports iron produced in Minas Gerais. In the mineral extractive industry, in 2019, Rio de Janeiro was the largest producer of oil and natural gas in Brazil, with 71% of the total volume produced. São Paulo comes in 2nd place, with an 11.5% share of total production. Espírito Santo was the third largest producer state, with 9.4%. Composição do PIB do estado do Rio de JaneiroRio aumenta sua participação na produção nacional de petróleo e gás In recent years, Espírito Santo has stood out in the production of oil and natural gas. With several discoveries made, mainly by Petrobras, the State left the fifth position in the Brazilian ranking of reserves, in 2002, to become one of the largest oil province in the country, with total reserves of 2.5 billion barrels. There are about 140 thousand barrels a day. Oil fields are located both on land and at sea, in shallow, deep and ultra-deep waters, containing light and heavy oil and non-associated gas. In the urban centers of the capital and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, practically all the main units of the Espírito Santo transformation industry are concentrated. The steel industries are located in the capital Vitória: Companhia Ferro e Aço de Vitória, iron ore pelletizing plant of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce; lumber, textiles, crockery, instant coffee, chocolates and refrigerators. In the Itapemirim river valley, cement, sugar and alcohol and canned fruit industries are developed. The 10 largest industrial companies in Espírito Santo are: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (mining), ArcelorMittal Tubarão (steel mill), Samarco Mineração (mining), Aracruz Celulose, Fertilizers Heringer, ArcelorMittal Sul Fluminense (steel mill), Escelsa (electricity distribution company), Garoto (the largest chocolate factory in Latin America and the most important industrial food company of the state) and Sol Coqueria. Espírito Santo is a major steel producer, due to two steel mills present in its territory: ArcelorMittal Tubarão (formerly Companhia Siderúrgica de Tubarão), in the capital Vitória, which, in 2018, produced 7 million tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country; and ArcelorMittal Sul Fluminense (formerly Votorantim Siderurgia), also in the capital, which produced 1 million tons of crude steel in the same year.A Siderurgia em Números 2019, página 11 In the paper and cellulose sector, Brazilian pulp production was 19.691 million tons in 2019. The country exported US $ 7.48 billion in pulp this year, US $ 3.25 billion only to China. Brazilian forest-based industry exports totaled US $ 9.7 billion (US $ 7.48 billion in cellulose, US $ 2 billion in paper and US $ 265 million in wood panels). Paper production was 10.535 million tons in 2019. The country exported 2.163 million tons. In 2016, the paper and cellulose industry in the South of the country represented 33% of the national total. Espírito Santo stands out in this sector. In 2018, U$ 920 million were traded in the sale of cellulose to the foreign market, the third strongest Espírito Santo product in the export balance. In 2016, the top five states producing logs for paper and cellulose (mainly eucalyptus) were: Paraná (15.9 million m³), São Paulo (14.7 million m³) , Bahia (13.6 million m³), Mato Grosso do Sul (9.9 million m³) and Minas Gerais (7.8 million m³). Together, they correspond to 72.7% of the national production of 85.1 million m³. Espírito Santo, 9th place, had a production of 4.1 million m³. São Mateus, in the North of Espírito Santo, was the best placed city in the Southeast, as the 6th largest producer of roundwood for paper and cellulose in the country. The ten largest producing municipalities had 22.9% of the country's production. They were the cities of Telêmaco Borba (PR), Três Lagoas (MS), Caravelas (BA), Mucuri (BA), Ortigueira (PR), São Mateus (ES), Dom Eliseu (PR), Nova Viçosa (BA), Water Clara (MS) and Ribas do Rio Pardo (MS).Made in Espírito Santo: celulose capixaba é usada em papel até do outro lado do mundo The tertiary sector is underdeveloped throughout the state. However, commercial activity acquires a certain importance with iron ore exports from Minas Gerais, through the Vitória a Minas Railway and is shipped at the ports of Atalaia and Ponta do Tubarão. On the other hand, the connection of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim to the city of Rio de Janeiro, by paved highway, allowed the incorporation of the region into the Rio de Janeiro milk basin and facilitated the export of agricultural products, such as coffee, corn, manioc, rice and vegetables. The state's tourist activity is concentrated on the coast, where there are beaches, such as Itaúnas and Guarapari. The peak of Bandeira, the third highest in the country, is another tourist destination. Lately, a new type of tourism has gained prominence: gastronomic, in which typical Capixaba cuisine, heir to different cultures, is appreciated. The road system is organized from the BR-101, which crosses Espírito Santo from north to south, bordering the coast. The state has 30.1 thousand kilometers of highways, but only 10% are paved. =Tourism= Caparaó National Park. Canaã Valley, in Espírito Santo. Tourism plays an ever-increasing role in the state's economy and is a leading destination in Brazilian domestic tourism, although international tourism is rarer. Tourist destinations include coastal areas such as Guarapari, Jacaraípe and Manguinhos, and mountain retreats such as Domingos Martins. Guarapari is also a local tourist destination, known for its healing black sand beaches. Coastal cuisine is an attraction, with moqueca capixaba and other local seafood dishes among traditional offerings. Inland, there are many natural attractions, such as the national parks of Pedra Azul and Caparaó. In 2016, an ongoing drought over much of the state negatively impacted coffee and other crops. =Transportation= Port Vitória's harbour entrance with the tallest bridge in Brazil and Camburi Beach in the background. The port of Vitória is the most difficult to access among Brazilian port. The bay on which it is located is extremely narrow, with rocks, reefs and mountains making it challenging for freighters and maritime cruisers to reach the docks. This narrow approach also results in shipping passing closely to population centers. In Vitória, ships sail in close proximity to cars and pedestrians. The location of the port in the city center also results in schedule complications, with limitations resulting from traffic constraints. Currently the main use of the port is for ship and oil platform repairs, as well as international shipping. Airports Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport, which serves Vitória, is located on a plot of land just over . Since construction of its first section, finished in 1946, the airport has undergone several expansions and modernizations, but current demand has surpassed its capacity of 560 thousand passengers a year. The passenger terminal has a constructed area of nearly , a check-in concourse, 25 check-in counters and boarding and arrival lounges. The recent construction of new aircraft parking boxes on the aprons has increased the airport’s operational efficiency. In 2003, more than 1.2 million passengers used the airport, and in 2004 this rose to some 1.25 million. Vitória is one of the 32 airports in the Infraero network that has a cargo terminal. In May 1999 the first direct international freight connection to the United States began operating in Vitória, facilitating American imports to the state of Espírito Santo. As of 2018, there are five such flights a week. A new runway and terminal were due at the end of 2007 but several budget inconsistencies were found and construction was halted.

This motto is a truncated version of the Jesuit motto \\"work as if everything depended on you, and trust as if everything depended on God\\", well spread by Spanish Catholic missionary José de Anchieta, and was chosen by Jerônimo Monteiro, who was Governor of Espírito Santo from 1908 to 1912. The flag was designed in 1908, with colours inspired by those of Our Lady of Victory (English: Nossa Senhora da Vitória), the state's patron saint, wearing traditional Portuguese clothing. It is one of the few flags in the world which use the colour pink.

The vessels were privately owned and operated for Her Majesty's Coastguard. Four vessels were stationed around the UK coastline, while a fifth was held in reserve. History The first vessels of the UK's ETV fleet were introduced in 1994 following the recommendations of Lord Donaldson's report 'Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas' published in May 1994 following the MV Braer oil spill of off the coast of Shetland, Scotland. Klyne Tugs Ltd of Lowestoft took over the ETV contract in 1999, and in February 2001 signed an eight-year contract to own and operate a four ETV vessel fleet, which in 2006 was extended by two years, to run until September 2011. Sovereign, entering service in 2003, and here near identical Princess, entering service in 2002, were both built for Kline's in China, being sailed to Britain to join Monarch and Prince. Monarch was built in 1999 in Japan. Klyne Tugs was taken over in 2007 by the JP Knight Group, Britain’s oldest tug and barge company, becoming JP Knight (Lowestoft) Ltd. The tugs wear the red and white livery of the MCA, with the black and white funnel colours of JP Knight. In 2010, the Government announced as part of the Department for Transport's share of cuts in the Comprehensive Spending Review, that the ETV fleet would be no longer be funded by the MCA from September 2011, saving £32.5m over the Spending Review period. The Department stated that \\"state provision of ETVs does not represent a correct use of taxpayers money and that ship salvage should be a commercial matter between a ship's operator and the salvor\\". Two days after the announcement that the fleet was to be disbanded, Anglian Prince was sent to the aid of the UK's newest nuclear submarine HMS Astute, which ran aground off the Isle of Skye in Scotland during sea trials. As part of the spending review, it was also announced that the status of the Maritime Incident Response Group (MIRG), comprising specialist teams of firefighters formed in 2006 from fifteen UK Fire and Rescue Services set up to respond to incidents at sea, would be reviewed, stating that \\"ships' crews are trained in basic firefighting techniques and there is little evidence that MIRG has changed the outcome of ship fires\\", and had not been involved in any significant incidents in its existence. A full cessation of the MIRG would save the Department £340,000 annually. On 30 September 2011 it was announced that the two ETVs operating in the Minch and the Shetland Islands received a moratorium of three months with an interim funding by the United Kingdom's government. Fleet As of 2010, four ETVs, Anglian Prince, Anglian Princess, Anglian Sovereign and Anglian Monarch, were based in strategic locations around the UK, with two covering the south coast of England, at Falmouth in Cornwall and Dover in Kent, and two in Scottish waters, at Stornoway the Western Isles (the Outer Hebrides), and Lerwick in the Northern Isles (Shetland and Orkney). The four strong ETV fleet is intended to be operational 24 hours a day 365 days a year and maintained at 30 minutes readiness to sail, with one tug allocated to each of the four operating areas on a rotational basis, worked around maintenance schedules. The Dover station is funded jointly with French maritime authorities. Monarch, Sovereign and Prince are purpose built offshore tugs, while Prince is a converted salvage tug. A fifth tug, the Anglian Earl, is an anchorhandling and salvage tug regularly used on commercial work, but also fits the ETV criteria, and acts as cover for any of the four ETV stations as and when required. The bollard pull capability of the fleet is as follows: * Anglian Monarch: 152 tonnes * Anglian Prince: 170 t * Anglian Princess: over 180 t * Anglian Sovereign: over 180 t ETV vessels can be temporarily relieved of station duties as required, such as when Prince was despatched on a four-day voyage to come to the aid of the Canadian submarine HMCS Chicoutimi, stranded in the Atlantic after a fire broke out during a delivery voyage from Scotland to Canada. In that instance, Prince was contracted commercially by the Royal Navy, with another ETV capable vessel quickly arranged to take her place in Stornoway.

Zestafoni David Abashidze Stadium (former Central Stadium) was built by the Zestafoni Ferro- alloy Plant. A couple of matches were held on the stadium before its opening in 1951. In 1952-1989 and 1999-2003 of Georgian Championship team FC Metallurg Zestafoni held matches on the Zestafoni central stadium, in 1990-1998 it was a home stadium for FC Margveti Zestafoni. Since 2004, FC Zestafoni has held home matches in the stadium. In 1981, reconstruction work was done on the arena; the west stand was roofed and the east stand was constructed. After these works capacity of the stadium increased to 8000 seats. In 2004, after establishing FC Zestafoni, central stadium was repaired and is still being repaired to renew the arena and comply with international standards. In 2005, works were done to renew the grass surface on the stadium. Georgian workers have constructed new drainage system of German technology. The field is watered with a watering system fromf an American Company “Rainbird”. (This watering system was successfully used on eight stadiums during the 2004 European Championship in Portugal.) On the Zestafoni central stadium, the field surface, “Natural Green Carpet”, was made by the Ukrainian firm “Lidia- Park”. FC Zestafoni management plans to build a new base for the club. Some new football fields have been constructed in Zestafoni (among them one with an artificial surface). Relevant infrastructure is being made – work out rooms are being repaired, building of new tribunes with personal seats is planned, along with the installment of a modern score-board. On 9 April 2010 the Stadium was named after David Abashidze who contributed tremendously to the development and revival of football in Zestafoni.

He served as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020 and was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. Buttigieg is a graduate of Harvard College and Oxford University, attending the latter on a Rhodes Scholarship. He was a consultant at the management consulting firm McKinsey from 2007 to 2010. From 2009 to 2017, he was an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant. He was mobilized and deployed to Afghanistan for seven months in 2014. Before running for office, Buttigieg worked on the political campaigns of Democrats Jill Long Thompson, Joe Donnelly, and John Kerry. Buttigieg was the 32nd mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from January 2012 to January 2020, earning him the nickname \\"Mayor Pete\\". Buttigieg came out as gay in 2015. Buttigieg launched his campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election on April 14, 2019. He became the first openly gay person to launch a major presidential campaign. Despite initially low expectations, he gained significant momentum in mid-2019 when he participated in several town halls, forums, and debates. Buttigieg narrowly won the pledged delegate count in the Iowa caucuses and tied the pledged delegate count in the New Hampshire primary. By earning the most delegates in Iowa, he became the first openly gay candidate to win a presidential primary or caucus. Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Joe Biden the following day.Epstein, Reid J. and Gabriel, Trip. Pete Buttigieg Drops Out of Democratic Presidential Race, The New York Times, March 1, 2020. Retrieved March 1, 2020. Early life and career Buttigieg was born on January 19, 1982, in South Bend, Indiana, the only child of Jennifer Anne (Montgomery) and Joseph A. Buttigieg. His parents met and married while employed as faculty at New Mexico State University. His father was born and raised in Hamrun, Malta, and had studied to be a Jesuit before emigrating to the United States and embarking on a secular career as a professor of literature at the University of Notre Dame near South Bend, where he taught for 29 years. Through his father Buttigieg automatically holds dual US-Maltese citizenship. His mother was born in Stanislaus County, California, graduated from Radford High School in El Paso, Texas, and attended the University of Texas at Austin, receiving her BA and MA in 1967; her mother was born in Oklahoma, and her father was born in Indiana. = Education = Buttigieg was valedictorian of the class of 2000 at St. Joseph High School in South Bend. That year, he won first prize in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum's Profiles in Courage essay contest. He traveled to Boston to accept the award and met Caroline Kennedy and other members of President Kennedy's family. The subject of his winning essay was the integrity and political courage of then U.S. representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of only two independent politicians in Congress. In 2000, Buttigieg was also chosen as one of two student delegates from Indiana to the United States Senate Youth Program, an annual scholarship competition sponsored jointly by the U.S. Senate and the Hearst Foundations. Buttigieg attended Harvard University, where he majored in history and literature. He became president of the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Institute of Politics and worked on the institute's annual study of youth attitudes on politics. He wrote his undergraduate thesis, titled The Quiet American's Errand into the Wilderness, on the influence of puritanism on U.S. foreign policy as reflected in Graham Greene's novel The Quiet American. The title of his thesis is also an allusion to American historian Perry Miller's work Errand into the Wilderness. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in 2004, and was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Buttigieg was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford. In 2007, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics after studying at Pembroke College, Oxford. At Oxford, he was an editor of the Oxford International Review, and was a co-founder and member of the Democratic Renaissance Project, an informal debate and discussion group of about a dozen Oxford students. = Professional career = Before graduating from college, Buttigieg was an investigative intern at WMAQ-TV, Chicago's NBC News affiliate. He also interned for Democrat Jill Long Thompson during her unsuccessful 2002 congressional bid. After college, Buttigieg worked on John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign as a policy and research specialist for several months in Arizona and New Mexico. When he accepted the offer to work for Kerry's campaign, he declined another to work for Barack Obama's 2004 United States Senate campaign. From 2004 to 2005, Buttigieg was conference director of the Cohen Group. In 2006, he lent assistance to Joe Donnelly's successful congressional campaign. After earning his Oxford degree, in 2007 Buttigieg became a consultant at the Chicago office of McKinsey & Company, where he worked on energy, retail, economic development, and logistics for three years. His clients at McKinsey included the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, electronics retailer Best Buy, Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws, two nonprofit environmentalist groups (the Natural Resources Defense Council and Energy Foundation) and several U.S. government agencies (the EPA, Energy Department, Defense Department, and Postal Service). He took a leave of absence from McKinsey in 2008 to become research director for Jill Long Thompson's unsuccessful campaign for Indiana governor. Buttigieg left McKinsey in 2010 in order to focus full-time on his campaign for Indiana state treasurer. Buttigieg has been involved with the Truman National Security Project since 2005 and serves as a fellow with expertise in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2014, he was named to the organization's board of advisors. = Military service = Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.alt= Buttigieg joined the U.S. Navy Reserve through the direct commission officer (DCO) program and was sworn in as an ensign in naval intelligence in September 2009. In 2014, he took a seven-month leave during his mayoral term to deploy to Afghanistan. While there, Buttigieg was part of a unit assigned to identify and disrupt terrorist finance networks. Part of this was done at Bagram Air Base, but he was also an armed driver for his commander on more than 100 trips into Kabul. Buttigieg has jokingly referred to this role as \\"military Uber\\", because he had to watch out for ambushes and explosive devices along the roads and ensure that the vehicle was guarded. In order to better communicate with the local Afghans, he learned some Dari (a dialect of the Persian language). Buttigieg was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal. He resigned his commission from the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2017. = Indiana state treasurer election = Buttigieg was the Democratic nominee for state treasurer of Indiana in 2010. He received 37.5% of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent Richard Mourdock.  Mayor of South Bend, Indiana  =Election and transition= Buttigieg campaign photo for Indiana State Treasurer in March 2010 Buttigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in the November 2011 election, with 10,991 of the 14,883 votes cast (74%). He took office in January 2012 at the age of 29, becoming the second-youngest mayor in South Bend history (Schuyler Colfax III had became mayor in 1898 when aged 28) and the youngest mayor of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents. In 2011, as South Bend's mayor-elect, Buttigieg supported John Broden in his successful bid to become St. Joseph County Democratic Party chairman. = First term =  Policing  In 2012, after a federal investigation ruled that South Bend police had illegally recorded telephone calls of several officers, Buttigieg demoted police chief Darryl Boykins. (Boykins had first been appointed in 2008 by Mayor Stephen Luecke, and reappointed by Buttigieg earlier in 2012.Former Police Chief Darryl Boykins has noteworthy career before resignation) Buttigieg also dismissed the department's communications director, the one who had actually \\"discovered the recordings but continued to record the line at Boykins' command\\". The police communications director alleged that the recordings captured four senior police officers making racist remarks and discussing illegal acts. The city is 26% black, but only 6% of the police force is black. Buttigieg has written that his \\"first serious mistake as mayor\\" came shortly after taking office in 2012, when he decided to ask for Boykins's resignation. The city's first ever African-American police chief accepted the request. However, the next day, backed by supporters and legal counsel, Boykin requested reinstatement. When Buttigieg denied this request, Boykin sued the city for racial discrimination, arguing that the taping policy had existed under previous police chiefs, who were white. Buttigieg settled the suits brought by Boykins and the four officers out of court for over $800,000. A federal judge ruled in 2015 that Boykins's recordings violated the Federal Wiretap Act. Buttigieg came under pressure from political opponents to release the tapes, but said that doing so would be a violation of the Wiretap Act. He called for the eradication of racial bias in the police force. An Indiana court is hearing a case for the release of the tapes. South Bend adopted the National Network for Safe Communities’ Group Violence Intervention approach in 2014. Urban development and blight removal initiatives As mayor, Buttigieg promoted the transformation of the former Studebaker plant location into a technology park named Ignition Park. He oversaw the city's launching of a 3-1-1 system in 2013. One of the major private developments to go through the city's approval process during Buttigieg's first term was a pair of seven- story condominiums along the St. Joseph River, across the river from Century Center. In December 2013, the Area Board of Zoning Appeals approved the approximately $38.5 million development. It broke ground in 2018. The city ultimately invested $5 million in related projects, such as an adjoining section of riverwalk. Buttigieg was a leading figure behind the creation of a nightly laser-light display along downtown South Bend's St. Joseph River trail as public art. The project cost $700,000, which was raised from private funds. The \\"River Lights\\" installation was unveiled in May 2015 as part of the city's 150th anniversary celebrations. By the end of Buttigieg's first term, South Bend had sold off 71 city-owned properties. A significant example was the former Bendix Corporation headquarters and factory, which the city sold to Curtis Products in 2014. In late 2014 and early 2015, South Bend negotiated the sale of the city-owned Blackthorn Golf Course. The LaSalle Hotel was sold to developers in 2015 for conversion into apartments. In his budget proposal for the 2014 fiscal year, Buttigieg proposed combining South Bend's Code Enforcement, Animal Control, and Building Department into a single Department of Building Services to save costs and improve efficiency. The proposal failed, and the three have remained separate departments. One of Buttigieg's signature programs has been the \\"Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative\\". Known locally as \\"1,000 Properties in 1,000 Days\\", it is a project to repair or demolish blighted properties across South Bend. The program reached its goal two months before its scheduled end date in November 2015. By the thousandth day of the program, before Buttigieg's first term ended, nearly 40% of the targeted houses were repaired, and 679 were demolished or under contract for demolition. Buttigieg took note of the fact that many homes within communities of color were the ones demolished, leading to early distrust between the city and these communities. Service in Afghanistan Buttigieg served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, returning to the United States on September 23, 2014. While deployed, he was assigned to the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a counterterrorism unit that targeted Taliban insurgency financing. In his absence, Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, South Bend's city comptroller, served as executive from February 2014 until Buttigieg returned to his role as mayor in October 2014. RFRA opposition In 2015, during the controversy over Indiana Senate Bill 101—the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people—Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation. Amid his reelection campaign, he came out as gay to express his solidarity with the LGBTQ community. Other In 2014, The Washington Post called Buttigieg \\"the most interesting mayor you've never heard of\\" based on his youth, education, and military background. = Second term = South Bend 150th Anniversary festivities, where Buttigieg performed live with singer-songwriter Ben Folds Reelection in 2015 In 2014, Buttigieg announced that he would seek a second term. He won the Democratic primary with 78% of the vote, defeating Henry Davis Jr., the city councilman from the second district. In November 2015, he was elected to his second term as mayor with over 80% of the vote, defeating Republican Kelly Jones by a margin of 8,515 to 2,074 votes. Housing, transportation, parks, and infrastructure In a new phase of the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative, South Bend partnered with the Notre Dame Clinical Law Center to provide free legal assistance to qualifying applicants wishing to acquire vacant lots and, with local nonprofits, to repair or construct homes and provide low-income home ownership assistance using South Bend HUD (Housing and Urban Development) funds. He increased city funding levels for home construction and improvement in the 2018 South Bend budget via several programs, including the UEA (Urban Enterprise Association) Pilot Home Repair Program, a grant intended to improve low-income residents' quality of life. In 2013, Buttigieg proposed a \\"Smart Streets\\" urban development program to improve South Bend's downtown area, and in early 2015—after traffic studies and public hearings—he secured a bond issue for the program backed by tax increment financing. \\"Smart Streets\\" was aimed at improving economic development and urban vibrancy as well as road safety. The project involved the conversion of one-way streets in downtown to two-way streets, traffic- calming measures, the widening of sidewalks, streetside beautification (including the planting of trees and installation of decorative brickwork), the addition of bike lanes and the introduction of roundabouts. Elements of the project were finished in 2016, and it was officially completed in 2017. The project was credited with spurring private development in the city. Under Buttigieg, South Bend invested $50 million in the city's parks, many of which had been neglected during the preceding decades; the city also began a \\"smart sewer\\" program, the first phase of which was finished in 2017 at a cost of $150 million. The effort utilized federal funds and by 2019 had reduced the combined sewer overflow by 75%. The impetus for the effort was a fine that the EPA had levied against the city in 2011 for Clean Water Act violations. By 2019, the city had seen $374 million in private investment for mixed-use developments since Buttigieg had taken office. In 2016, the City of South Bend partnered with the State of Indiana and private developers to break ground on a $165 million renovation of the former Studebaker complex, with the aim to make the complex home to tech companies and residential condos. This development is in the so-called \\"Renaissance District\\", which includes nearby Ignition Park. In 2017, it was announced that the long-abandoned Studebaker Building 84 (also known as \\"Ivy Tower\\") would have its exterior renovated with $3.5 million in Regional Cities funds from the State of Indiana and $3.5 million from South Bend tax increment financing, with plans for the building and other structures in its complex to serve as a technology hub. While many aspects of South Bend had improved by 2016, a Princeton University study found that the rate of evictions in the city had worsened, more than doubling since Buttigieg took office. In January 2019, Buttigieg launched the South Bend Home Repair initiative. This expanded the existing South Bend Home Repair Pilot, which helps make available funds to assist residents with home repairs, through the use of $600,000 in city funding (double what the city had earlier pledged to the program) and $300,000 in block grants. It also created two new programs. The first of these is the South Bend Green Corps, which makes funds available to lower-income homeowners for such uses as energy-saving measures and basic weatherization, the installation of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, lead tests, and energy bill review. It also provides education on reducing energy bills. The South Bend Green Corps was funded with $290,000 from the city and $150,000 from AmeriCorps. The second program is Love Your Block, which assists citizen groups and local nonprofits in revitalizing neighborhoods, and which was funded with $25,000 from the city and $25,000 from the nonprofit Cities of Service. Buttigieg had been arranging a deal under which the city's parks department would sell Elbel Golf Course to developers for $747,500. In January 2016, amid public pressure, the city dropped the plan. The idea had been floated in 2014, when the city was exploring selling the Blackthorn golf course, but began to gain momentum in 2015. Buttigieg had justified the plan to sell the city-owned golf course by claiming that residents found golf to be a low priority, that the course had failed to turn a profit for over five years, and that the city was subsidizing rounds of golf at about $2 per round. Buttigieg characterized the course as a drain on the city's finances. Opposition arose, with concerns that the sale would limit public access to the land and endanger the protection of wetlands surrounding it. At , Elbel constituted the city's largest park. The park, while owned by the city, is outside city boundaries. The original plan Buttigieg outlined for the sale would have allowed it to be developed freely by the buyer. Buttigieg supported a proposed high-rise development in South Bend's East Bank neighborhood that would greatly exceed the existing height ordinances. In the weeks after the Common Council voted against the development in December 2016, Buttigieg and his administration negotiated a new compromise plan with the developer, Matthews LLC, that reduced the height from twelve stories to nine. In January 2017, the Common Council voted to approve a ten-year tax abatement for the $35 million development. In February, the Common Council raised the height limits for the East Bank neighborhood to facilitate the development. The city later committed $5 million in tax increment financing to the project. In September 2019, the city of South Bend finalized a long-anticipated agreement with St. Joseph County to jointly fund the county's $18 million share of the project to double-track the South Shore Line. Beginning in August 2018, Buttigieg promoted the idea of moving the city's South Shore Line station from South Bend International Airport to the city's downtown. He made it a goal to have the city complete this project by 2025. Buttigieg's earlier budgets had allotted funding to the existing South Shore Relocation project, which would have moved the station to a different end of the South Bend International Airport. Buttigieg's new push for a downtown station engendered suggestions of other possible locations. Buttigieg ordered a study of five location options, including his personally preferred downtown option, as well as two that would keep the station at the airport. Of the five, the downtown location was found to be the priciest, but also the one with the greatest potential economic impact. In December 2018, an engineering study was commissioned to further examine the cost of a downtown station. In 2019, South Bend launched Commuters Trust, a new transportation benefit program created in collaboration with local employers and transportation providers (including South Bend TRANSPO and Lyft) and made possible by a $1 million three-year grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge. During Buttigieg's tenure, Downtown South Bend saw roughly $200 million in private investment. Police and fire services In late September 2017, in his budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year, Buttigieg sought Common Council approval to create the new position of Director of Public Safety, which would have oversight over the city's fire and police chiefs. Such a position had existed in South Bend during the mayoralties of Jerry Miller and Peter Nemeth; Nemeth eliminated the position in 1976. Buttigieg's budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year earmarked $105,000 for the position's salary, which was more than the salary of the fire chief or police chief at the time. The plan was opposed by members of the fire and police forces, including the local Fraternal Order of Police lodge. Criticisms included claims that it was unfair to both the fire and police chiefs to create an additional layer of bureaucracy between them and the mayor. The Common Council rejected Buttigieg's proposal, and he rescinded the request. In late October 2019, it was announced that the South Bend Mayor's Office would have a slightly different new division, the Division of Community Initiatives. This is budgeted to be launched in 2020, when Buttigieg's successor will take office. Buttigieg supported this department's creation. In September 2018, South Bend sent roughly 20 members of its fire department's Swift Water Rescue Group to Raleigh, North Carolina, to assist in anticipation of Hurricane Florence. After a white South Bend police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, an African-American man, in June 2019, Buttigieg was drawn from his presidential campaign to focus on the emerging public reaction. Body cameras were not turned on during Logan's death. Soon after Logan's death, Buttigieg presided over a town hall attended by disaffected activists from the African- American community as well as relatives of the deceased man. The local police union accused Buttigieg of making decisions for political gain. In November 2019, Buttigieg secured $180,000 to commission a review of South Bend's police department policies and practices to be conducted by Chicago-based consulting firm 21CP Solutions. During Buttigieg's tenure, the city's police force continued to struggle with a high homicide rate; the annual number of murders in South Bend was 18 in 2012, 9 in 2013, 17 in 2014, 7 in 2015, 14 in 2016, 15 in 2017, and 13 in 2018. Other civic matters Buttigieg's budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year included items to address various public health concerns, including funding for a \\"healthy homes\\" program, which was ultimately included in the 2018 budget approved by the Common Council. Buttigieg also made a request for $24 million to fund new green spaces in the city that was ultimately excluded from the budget. Buttigieg's budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year included $156,000 for paid parental leave to city employees. Buttigieg had expressed his openness to a proposal by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians to open a tribal casino in South Bend. The Common Council approved a casino deal in April 2016, and the Pokagon Band received federal clearance to put the land into a required trust in November 2016. Under a revenue-sharing agreement that the Pokagon Band voluntarily entered into with the city, the city receives the greater of 2% of the casino's annual Class II gaming revenues or either $1 million or $2 million (depending on the number of games at the casino). The casino opened in January 2018 as Four Winds South Bend. In 2018, Women's Care Center, a crisis pregnancy center chain, petitioned the city to allow it to rezone a residential property to allow it to open a location adjacent to a planned Whole Woman's Health abortion clinic (which would be the only abortion clinic in the city, which had been without one since 2015). The rezoning case became a flashpoint between local anti-abortion activists supporting the rezoning and abortion- rights activists opposing it. In April 2018, the city council voted 5–4 to allow the rezoning. The group Pro Choice South Bend, which opposed the rezoning, organized a letter-writing campaign and other efforts to urge Buttigieg to use his veto power to block the rezoning. Amid this, Buttigieg's office reportedly reached out to Whole Woman's Health Alliance and discussed various concerns. Four days after the Common Council's vote to approve the rezoning, Buttigieg vetoed it, in a decision he described as \\"one of the hardest decisions I've ever made\\" as mayor. In a letter to Common Council members, Buttigieg said he was persuaded by data provided by the abortion clinic showing that there were higher rates of threats, harassment, and violence at abortion clinics near crisis pregnancy centers, but was careful not to criticize the crisis pregnancy center, writing that he believed that representatives of both the abortion clinic and the crisis pregnancy center \\"are good residents who seek to support women by providing services consistent with their values.\\" In a press conference he held to explain his veto, he declared, \\"Issues on the morality or the legality of abortion are dramatically beyond my pay grade as mayor. For us this is a neighborhood issue, and it’s a zoning issue.\\" In mid-May 2018, Buttigieg said he was willing to work with Women's Care Center to find a different location in the area. Women's Care Center eventually opened at a location across the street from the planned abortion clinic. When Buttigieg ran for president, some criticized his assistance to Women's Care Center as a failure to stick strongly to his abortion-rights position. Also in 2018, Buttigieg explored annexing several areas bordering the city and redrawing the boundaries of several of the city's tax increment financing districts to better serve neighborhoods that had not benefited from redevelopment. In August 2018, South Bend pledged a $3.7 million bond issue to assist the Potawatomi Zoo in funding its renovations. In September, it was announced that the zoo renovation had obtained additional funding from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation's Regional Cities Initiative. In August 2018, Buttigieg declared an intent to include a focus on neighborhoods in his budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year. In addition to improvements to infrastructure, such as streetlights, Buttigieg also promoted the expansion of the city's Group Violence Intervention efforts, which he believed were showing success at reducing violent crime among the city's youth. The Common Council approved many of Buttigieg's requests in its 2019 budget. Speculations about higher office and national political involvement In the United States Senate election in Indiana he campaigned on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Evan Bayh and criticized Bayh's opponent, Todd Young, for having voiced support in 2010 for retaining the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which Bayh had voted to repeal. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Buttigieg endorsed Hillary Clinton. He also endorsed Democratic nominee Lynn Coleman in that year's election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district, which includes South Bend. In 2016, columnist Frank Bruni of The New York Times published a column praising Buttigieg's work as mayor, with a headline asking if he might be \\"the first gay president\\". Additionally, Barack Obama was cited as mentioning him as one of the Democratic Party's talents in a profile on the former president conducted by The New Yorker. For the 2018 midterms, Buttigieg founded the political action committee Hitting Home PAC. That October, Buttigieg personally endorsed 21 congressional candidates. He also later endorsed Mel Hall, Democratic nominee in the election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district. Buttigieg also campaigned in support of Joe Donnelly's reelection campaign in the United States Senate election in Indiana. Buttigieg campaigned for candidates in more than a dozen states, including early presidential primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina, a move indicating potential interest in running for president. Succession as mayor In December 2018, Buttigieg announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor of South Bend. In February 2019, Buttigieg endorsed James Mueller in the 2019 South Bend mayoral election. Mueller was a high-school classmate of Buttigieg's and his mayoral chief of staff, and later executive director of the South Bend Department of Community Investment. Mueller's campaign promised to continue the progress that had been made under Buttigieg's mayoralty. Buttigieg appeared in campaign ads for Mueller and donated to Mueller's campaign. Mueller won the May 2019 Democratic primary with 37% of the vote in a crowded field. In the November 2019 general election, Mueller defeated Republican nominee Sean M. Haas with 63% of the vote. Mueller took office on New Year's Day 2020.  2017 DNC chairmanship campaign  In January 2017, Buttigieg announced his candidacy for chair of the Democratic National Committee in its 2017 chairmanship election. He built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC chairman Howard Dean, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, Indiana senator Joe Donnelly, and North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp. Buttigieg \\"campaigned on the idea that the aging Democratic Party needed to empower its millennial members\\". Former U.S. secretary of labor Tom Perez and U.S. representative Keith Ellison quickly emerged as the favored candidates of a majority of DNC members. Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election without endorsing a candidate, and Perez was elected chair after two rounds of voting.  2020 presidential campaign  candidacy for president in 2020 on April 14, 2019215x215px On January 23, 2019, Buttigieg announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the upcoming 2020 election. Buttigieg sought the Democratic Party nomination for president. If he had been elected, he would have been the youngest and first openly gay American president. Buttigieg officially launched his campaign on April 14, 2019, in South Bend. Buttigieg describes himself as a progressive and a supporter of democratic capitalism. Historian David Mislin identifies Buttigieg as a pragmatic progressive in the tradition of the Social Gospel movement once strong in the Midwest.David Mislin, Pete Buttigieg reviving pragmatic, progressive ideals of Social Gospel, UPI (November 7, 2019), republished at The National Interest (November 11, 2019). Buttigieg identifies regulatory capture as a significant problem in American society. In early February 2020, Buttigieg led the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses results with 26.2% to Bernie Sanders’ 26.1%, winning 14 delegates to Sanders's 12. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg's first national endorsement, noted the historical first of an LGBTQ candidate winning a state presidential primary. Buttigieg finished second behind Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. After placing a fourth in the South Carolina primary with 8.2% of the vote, behind Joe Biden (48.7%), Bernie Sanders (19.8%), and Tom Steyer (11.3%); he dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020 and endorsed Biden.  Post-2020 presidential campaign  In April 2020, Buttigieg launched Win The Era PAC – a new super PAC to raise money and distribute it to down-ballot Democrats The PAC focused on local elected positions, and its list of endorsements included candidates such as Jaime Harrison, Cal Cunningham, Gina Ortiz Jones, Christine Hunschofsky, and Levar Stoney. On June 8, 2020 the University of Notre Dame announced it had hired Buttigieg as a teacher and researcher for the 2020–21 academic year. Buttigieg delivered a speech on the closing night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Since the end of his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has been mentioned as a potential member of Joe Biden's administration, should Biden win the presidency.  Political positions  = Social issues = Buttigieg supports abortion rights and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion services in all but the most extreme circumstances. He favors amending civil rights legislation, including the Federal Equality Act so that LGBT Americans receive federal non-discrimination protections. Buttigieg supports expanding opportunities for national service, including a voluntary year of national service for those turning 18 years old. In July 2019, Buttigieg shared his \\"Douglass Plan\\", named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to address systemic racism in America. The initiative would allocate $10 billion to African-American entrepreneurship over five years, grant $25 billion to historically black colleges, legalize marijuana, expunge drug convictions, halve the federal prison population, and propose a federal New Voting Rights Act designed to increase voting access. Buttigieg supports eliminating the death penalty, marijuana legalization, moving toward reversing criminal sentences for minor drug-related offenses, and eliminating incarceration for drug possession offenses. In 2019, he called for the U.S. to \\"decriminalize mental illness and addiction through diversion, treatment, and re-entry programs\\" with a goal of decreasing \\"the number of people incarcerated due to mental illness or substance use by 75% in the first term.\\" =Government reform, voting rights, and campaign finance= Buttigieg favors the abolition of the Electoral College and has also called for restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences. He supports a constitutional amendment on campaign finance to reduce the undue influence of money in politics. Buttigieg supports statehood for the District of Columbia, and said that he would support Puerto Rico statehood if desired by the Puerto Rican people. = Climate change = Buttigieg at a town hall meeting in Des Moines on October 12, 2019, with supporters holding signs saying 'Climate is a Crisis' Buttigieg has said that, if elected, he will restore the United States' commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and double its pledge to the Green Climate Fund. He also supports the Green New Deal proposed by House Democrats, solar panel subsidies, and a carbon tax and dividend policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. =Economy, commerce, and workers' rights= Buttigieg speaking at the 2019 Iowa Federation of Labor Convention. Buttigieg has spoken on the need to work with labor unions. Buttigieg identifies as a democratic capitalist and has decried crony capitalism. He has entertained the possibility of antitrust actions against large technology companies on the basis of privacy and data security concerns. In July 2019, he released a plan to strengthen union bargaining power, to raise the minimum wage to $15, and to offer national paid family leave. =Education= Buttigieg's education plan includes a $700 billion investment in universal full-day child care and pre-K for all children from infancy to age 5. Buttigieg also wants to triple Title I funding for schools. Other goals include doubling the amount of new teachers of color in the next 10 years, addressing school segregation with a $500 million fund, paying teachers more, expanding mental health services in schools, and creating more after-school programs and summer learning opportunities. His plan for debt-free college partially involves expanding Pell Grants for low and middle-income students, as well as other investments and ending Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. Under his plan, the bottom 80% of students would get free college, with the other 20% paying some or all of the tuition themselves on a sliding scale. Buttigieg opposes free college tuition for all students because he believes it unfairly subsidizes higher-income families at the expense of lower-income people who do not attend college, a position distinguishing him from other progressives who support free college tuition for all. = Foreign policy = Buttigieg called for modifying the structure of defense spending, while suggesting that he might favor an overall increase in defense spending. During a speech in June 2019 at Indiana University, Buttigieg called for realigning priorities in military spending \\"to adequately prepare for our evolving security challenges\\" rather than for past threats, saying, \\"In the coming decades, we are more likely than ever to face insurgencies, asymmetric attacks, and high-tech strikes with cyberweapons or drones. Yet our latest defense budget calls for spending more on 3 Virginia-class submarines—$10.2 billion—than on cyberdefenses. It proposes spending more on a single frigate than on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\" Buttigieg has said that he believes the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks was justified but now supports withdrawing American troops from the region with a maintained intelligence presence. He is a committed supporter of Israel,Omri Nahmias, Pete Buttigieg: U.S. support for Israel is not support for annexation, Jerusalem Post (October 29, 2019). favors a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,Jackson Richmand, Record at a glance: Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports two-state solution, blames Hamas for lack of peace, Jewish News Syndicate (April 15, 2019). opposes proposals for Israel to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and disapproves of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments in support of applying Israeli law in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In June 2019, Buttigieg said: \\"We will remain open to working with a regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the American people. But we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals.\\" He supports ending U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Buttigieg has condemned China for its mass detention of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang. He criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics say gave Turkey the green light to launch its military offensive against Syrian Kurds. = Health care = Buttigieg opposed Republican efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2018, Buttigieg said he favored Medicare for All.Daniel Strauss, Buttigieg backed 'Medicare for All' in 2018 tweet, Politico (October 16, 2019). During his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has promoted \\"Medicare for All Who Want It\\" (a public option for health insurance).Abby Goodnough, 'Public Option' Draws Voters Unsure About 'Medicare for All', The New York Times (November 24, 2019).'Just The Right Policy': Pete Buttigieg On His 'Medicare For All Who Want It' Plan, NPR, Morning Edition (November 8, 2019).Transcript: Night 2 of the first Democratic debate (June 28, 2019). He has spoken favorably of Maryland's all- payer rate setting. Buttigieg has described \\"Medicare for All Who Want It\\" as inclusive, more efficient than the current system, and a possible precursor or \\"glide path\\" to single-payer health insurance. He also favors a partial expansion of Medicare that would allow Americans ages 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, and supports proposed legislation (the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act), that would \\"create a fund to guarantee up to 12 weeks of partial income for workers to care for newborn children or family members with serious illnesses.\\"Kevin Uhrmacher, Kevin Schaul, Paulina Firozi and Jeff Stein, Where 2020 Democrats stand on Health Care, The Washington Post (last updated December 11, 2019). In August 2019, Buttigieg released a $300 billion plan to expand mental health care services and fight addiction. = Immigration = Buttigieg supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and has drawn attention to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies. He defended a resident of Granger, Indiana, who was deported after living in the U.S. for 17 years despite regularly checking in with ICE and applying for a green card. Buttigieg has said Trump has been reckless in sending American troops to the southern border, and that it is a measure of last resort. = Infrastructure = During his 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination, Buttigieg proposed spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure projects over the next 10 years, estimating that the plan would create at least 6 million jobs. The plan focused on green energy, protecting tap water from lead, fixing roads and bridges, improving public transportation, repairing schools, guaranteeing broadband internet access, and preparing communities for floods and other natural disasters.  Personal life  Cathedral of St. James, which Buttigieg attends Buttigieg is a Christian, and he has said his faith has had a strong influence in his life. His parents had him baptized in a Catholic church as an infant and he attended Catholic schools. While at the University of Oxford, Buttigieg began to attend Christ Church Cathedral and said he felt \\"more-or-less Anglican\\" by the time he returned to South Bend. St. Augustine, James Martin, and Garry Wills are among his religious influences. A member of the Episcopal Church, Buttigieg is a congregant at the Cathedral of St. James in downtown South Bend. In addition to his native English, Buttigieg has some knowledge of Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic, Dari Persian, and French.  * Buttigieg plays guitar and piano, and in 2013 performed with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra as a guest piano soloist with Ben Folds. Buttigieg was a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow. He was a recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Fenn Award in 2015. In a June 2015 piece in the South Bend Tribune, Buttigieg came out as gay. By coming out, Buttigieg became Indiana's first openly gay elected executive. He was the first elected official in Indiana to come out while in office, and the highest elected official in Indiana to come out. Buttigieg was also the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate, and the second overall, after Republican Fred Karger, who ran in 2012. In December 2017, Buttigieg announced his engagement to Chasten Glezman, a junior high school teacher. They had been dating since August 2015 after meeting on the dating app Hinge. They were married on June 16, 2018, in a private ceremony at the Cathedral of St. James in South Bend. This made Buttigieg the first mayor of South Bend to get married while in office. Chasten uses his husband's surname, Buttigieg. In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, a watershed moment in the LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named him one of its \\"Pride50\\" people identified as \\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\\". In September 2020, Buttigieg officiated the wedding of his mayoral successor James Mueller.

The film stars Samantha Morton, Helen Hunt and Aaron Paul. The film tells the story of Annie Parker and the discovery of the BRCA1 breast cancer gene. Plot 11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of the prestigious journal Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century. At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all the accompanying difficulties, soon follow. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne’s closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. While Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite \\"the disappeared\\" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in Science a short time later. Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time, and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. Anne Parker happily remarried, and a few years later contracts cancer for a third time. And survives again. And she laughed while being treated, for reasons only she knew and understood.

Though it was a minor skirmish, it was the first battle of the Geronimo campaign and ended after the Apaches were routed from their positions.http://www.forttours.com/pages/apacheeastbattle.asp#devil Battle On May 16, 1885, about twenty-five Chiricahuas were on one of their many raids into Arizona and New Mexico from northern Mexico. That day the renegades had killed two miners near Alma and stole some horses so on May 17 Captain Allen Smith set out from Fort Apache, Arizona and headed for the site of the latest murder. Smith was leading a force of two companies from the 4th Cavalry and some of the Apache Scouts under Lieutenants Leighton Finley and Charles B. Gatewood. On the sixth day Smith's command was riding through canyonlands along Devil's Creek, in the Mogollon Mountains, when suddenly the Apaches opened fire with rifles from the top of a large cliff. During the fight that ensued, one Apache scout and two American soldiers were wounded and two of their horses were killed. The soldiers and scouts who fought in the battle believed Geronimo was leading the renegades but author Gregory Michno says it was a warrior named Chihuahua.Michno, pg. 346-347 Captain Smith reported the following about the encounter; > ...As no one with me knew anything about the country we were in; and as this > was the first water we had found since leaving camp, I determined to go into > camp. The creek was between two mountains about 600 feet high and very > steep. About an hour after going into camp I sent some Scouts up the Mt. on > the South side to look up the trail. When they got near the top they were > fired on by the Chiricahuas. The Scouts came down on the run but rallied and > went up the Mt. with the men, who immediately charged up. The Indians had > selected a good point to receive us, but we got to the top so well, and so > rapidly under the circumstances that they broke and ran soon before we got > to the top. About 600 yds further on we found their main camp. I believe > this to be the first camp they had made from the time they left Turkey > Creek. In the camp we got a large quantity of meat drying, one saddled horse > and two other horses. There were nineteen fires in this camp. The fight > lasted about half an hour, and the Indians fired very rapidly and a great > many shots. Two men, Pvt Haag, Troop A, shot in right thigh, and Pvt > Williams, Troop K, slightly wounded in arm, and one scout shot, quite > badlythrough left armone horse killed and another wounded, belonging to > TroopAwere the casualties on our side. From the indications, blood near > the rifle pits, etc., I am of the opinion that we wounded some of the > Indians. The officers, Lts. Parker, Gatewood, Lockett & Finley, 10th Cavy, > men and Scouts all behaved remarkably well. Lt. Parker who was closest to > the front of the attack, was the first officer on top of the Mt. After the > fight (I had some men saddle up all the horses while the fight was going on) > I advanced three or four miles, beyond where the fight took place, but as > the trail was scattered in every direction & the Scouts could tell me > nothing about water beyond I returned to my camp, leaving a guard on the Mt. > I attended to the wounded the best I could. The wounded Scout says Geronimo > shot him. The Indians were evidently laying for us, as they had made their > trail so they could have had a cross fire on the command as we climbed the > Mt. It was fortunate I went into camp & disappointed them, as they > undoubtedly would have hurt us more with less chance for us to retaliate > than we had. When we got on top of the Mt. every sign of the Indians > themselves has disappeared. The top of Mt. for several miles was heavily > timbered. One American soldier, in a post-war account of the engagement, said that \\"several men had been bathing in the stream when the Indians opened up and they carried on the fight in their birthday uniforms.\\" At the time Lieutenant Leighton Finley was in the 10th Cavalry but he was detached from his unit to command the Apache scouts when they rode with the 4th Cavalry. At the request of Lieutenant James Parker, a future general, Lieutenant Finley wrote the following account of the skirmish at Devils Creek; > After Captain Smith and Lieut. Lockett had left and at about 2 oclock, the > herd still being driven, slowly, on account of the steepness, up the side of > the easterly hill, and not yet, as I remember, having quite arrived at the > summit, a shot was fired, followed quickly by other shots, and almost > immediately firing began sharp and rapidthis fire, as subsequently > discovered, being drawn from the hostiles by the scouts whom Lieut. Gatewood > in obedience to Capt. Smiths orders had sent to the summit of the easterly > hill to act as videttes. You [James Parker], Lieut. Gatewood and myself were > seated, under a tree, on the easterly bank of the creek. All of the enlisted > men, except those of the pack train, were in camp in the west bank of the > creek.

In other words, if the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an output does not change linearly, but depends on the second derivative (or, loosely speaking, higher-order terms) of the modeling function. Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree of curvature is called the convexity.  Terminology  Strictly speaking, convexity refers to the second derivative of output price with respect to an input price. In derivative pricing, this is referred to as Gamma (Γ), one of the Greeks. In practice the most significant of these is bond convexity, the second derivative of bond price with respect to interest rates. As the second derivative is the first non-linear term, and thus often the most significant, \\"convexity\\" is also used loosely to refer to non-linearities generally, including higher-order terms. Refining a model to account for non- linearities is referred to as a convexity correction.  Mathematics  Formally, the convexity adjustment arises from the Jensen inequality in probability theory: the expected value of a convex function is greater than or equal to the function of the expected value: :E[f(X)] \\\\geq f(E[X]). Geometrically, if the model price curves up on both sides of the present value (the payoff function is convex up, and is above a tangent line at that point), then if the price of the underlying changes, the price of the output is greater than is modeled using only the first derivative. Conversely, if the model price curves down (the convexity is negative, the payoff function is below the tangent line), the price of the output is lower than is modeled using only the first derivative. The precise convexity adjustment depends on the model of future price movements of the underlying (the probability distribution) and on the model of the price, though it is linear in the convexity (second derivative of the price function).  Interpretation  The convexity can be used to interpret derivative pricing: mathematically, convexity is optionality – the price of an option (the value of optionality) corresponds to the convexity of the underlying payout. In Black–Scholes pricing of options, omitting interest rates and the first derivative, the Black–Scholes equation reduces to \\\\Theta = -\\\\Gamma, \\"(infinitesimally) the time value is the convexity\\". That is, the value of an option is due to the convexity of the ultimate payout: one has the option to buy an asset or not (in a call; for a put it is an option to sell), and the ultimate payout function (a hockey stick shape) is convex – \\"optionality\\" corresponds to convexity in the payout. Thus, if one purchases a call option, the expected value of the option is higher than simply taking the expected future value of the underlying and inputting it into the option payout function: the expected value of a convex function is higher than the function of the expected value (Jensen inequality). The price of the option – the value of the optionality – thus reflects the convexity of the payoff function. This value is isolated via a straddle – purchasing an at-the-money straddle (whose value increases if the price of the underlying increases or decreases) has (initially) no delta: one is simply purchasing convexity (optionality), without taking a position on the underlying asset – one benefits from the degree of movement, not the direction. From the point of view of risk management, being long convexity (having positive Gamma and hence (ignoring interest rates and Delta) negative Theta) means that one benefits from volatility (positive Gamma), but loses money over time (negative Theta) – one net profits if prices move more than expected, and net loses if prices move less than expected.  Convexity adjustments  From a modeling perspective, convexity adjustments arise every time the underlying financial variables modeled are not a martingale under the pricing measure. Applying Girsanov's theoremD. Papaioannou (2011): \\"Applied Multidimensional Girsanov Theorem\\", SSRN allows expressing the dynamics of the modeled financial variables under the pricing measure and therefore estimating this convexity adjustment. Typical examples of convexity adjustments include: * Quanto options: the underlying is denominated in a currency different from the payment currency. If the discounted underlying is martingale under its domestic risk neutral measure, it is not any more under the payment currency risk neutral measure * Constant maturity swap (CMS) instruments (swaps, caps/floors)P.

Rohan has set his eyes on being a stockbroker in Mumbai because that's the quickest way to make big money. He goes to Mumbai with his best friend Abhay (Samar Virmani), a fellow MBA graduate, and on their first night out he meets Neha Kapoor (Simran Mundi) and the two have a war of words; for the first time in his life his advances have been rejected by a girl. Rohan, Abhay and 28 new stockbrokers start work at Bombay Bulls but after three months only the 10 best will survive and get permanent placements. Rohan pitches clients but doesn't climb the charts; he remains near the bottom, so he uses the help of Vikram Khurrana (Alyy Khan), the firm's best stockbroker, to climb the charts faster. Vikram introduces Rohan to Amrita Singhania (Achint Kaur), a wealthy society lady who is instantly taken by Rohan's boyish charm; the same night he also bumps into Neha and this time he doesn't budge until she agrees to go on a date with him. The next day, Amrita invites Rohan to a beach party where she tries to seduce him with her sultry body. Rohan takes Neha to a spiritual date and courts her further until she completely falls in love with him. At the same time he pursues Amrita, who agrees to let him make trades for her and upon making her a large profit she invites him to celebrate in Goa. The same weekend is Rohan's 25th birthday and Neha comes to Goa to surprise him, but finds him in bed with Amrita. Rohan can't remember what happened, he was too drunk; heartbroken Neha storms away. In Mumbai, Rohan makes two more attempts to apologize but Neha won't give him another chance. The distance between them grows. He also has a showdown with Dalip and Abhay. Rohan gets more entwined into Amrita and Vikram's worlds but misses and longs for Neha. At Neha's best friend Shivangi's (Mansi Multani) engagement to Abhay, Rohan publicly begs Neha for forgiveness; she tells him she's pregnant but doesn't need him in her life. Rohan discovers Amrita and Vikram were just using him for their selfish plans; he has a showdown with Amrita and Vikram and gets thrown out of the firm. Rohan apologizes to his father for all his wrongdoings, then goes to Neha's house in Delhi to ask to be a part of their child's life only to discover that she's aborted their child. She wasn't ready for a child and was only having it to hurt him by keeping their child away from him. Rohan is shattered; Neha apologizes and asks him back in her life. Heartbroken, they embrace and accept each other for their flaws.

He resigned shortly from the position of the local counselor and took over the position of the direction of the Technical Department within the Cluj-Napoca Mayor-Office. In 2008, he again became a candidate for the position of the local counselor this time from the lists of the Democratic and Liberal Party. He was elected the local counselor of the Cluj Napoca muni and then, in June 2008, became the deputy mayor of the town. Then, in January 2009, he was elected as an acting mayor after the resignation of the mayor Emil Boc and on February 15th, 2009 the Liberal Democratic Party designated him as a candidate for the position of mayor at the partial local elections. He won the elections in the first round with 60, 48% of votes.

Mendoza was purportedly receiving between $5,000 and $8,000 per month in return for reporting national secrets to Chile. Peruvian President Alan Garcia left Singapore just before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in order to return home to deal with the crisis. The American ambassador in Lima, P.

Description  The size of the shell attains 150 mm. The shell is moderately large and rather thin. It is brilliantly pearly inside. It is covered with a reddish-brown periostracum which becomes olivaceous on the base. The form is rather depressed with turgid whorls, about six in all. The nucleus is white, blunt, imperfect. The base of the shell is flattened, bordered by a sparsely nodulous carina. The sculpture on the spire is slightly protractive, rounded, and short. It contains rather elevated riblets reaching about half way forward on the whorl from the suture (17 on the last whorl). These end in or are barely separated from the same number of stout nodules at the periphery, with a marked sulcus separating them from a similar row of nodules on the margin of the base. The base contains four somewhat undulated spiral ridges separated by subequal interspaces, except the inner pair which are smaller and closer to each other. The base is imperforate and is swollen at the base of the columella. The aperture is ample. The surface of the bodyis erased, leaving visible a pearly and white substance. The pearly columella is arcuate with no anterior prominence or tooth. The outer lip and the base is simple and sharp. The white operculum is rounded, shelly, with three partly gyrate, very prominent, granose, narrow ribs. The spaces between them are excavated and smooth.W.H.

Early life Born at South Perrot in Dorset, he was second son of John Slade (d. 1574), rector of South Perrot, who married in 1567 Joan, daughter of John Owsley of Misterton, Somerset. His elder brother Samuel Slade (1568–1612?) graduated B.A. at Oxford 1586, M.A. 1594, became vicar of Embleton, Northumberland, but resigned the living to travel in Europe and the east in search of manuscripts, and died in Zante before 1613. Matthew matriculated at St Alban Hall on 29 October 1585, and graduated B.A. on 13 January 1589. He taught a school in Devon. In Amsterdam About 1597 he went to Amsterdam, where he earned a living as a teacher and librarian. He became part of the city's intellectual life, and made a reputation as a controversialist. =Teacher and scholar= Slade met others with similar linguistic interests: Henry Ainsworth and Hugh Broughton.Sprunger, Trumpets, p. 49; Google Books. He also associated with the printer and Arabist Jan Theunisz, who was a Mennonite.Nijenhuis, p. 7; Google Books.GAMEO page Slade worked as assistant master in the Latin school in Koestraat from 1598, becoming rector there in 1602. As a scholar, Slade was on good terms with Isaac Casaubon, Gerard Vossius, and Joseph Justus Scaliger. =Church member= Slade became one of the first elders of the Brownist congregation in Amsterdam, with Daniel Studley and George Knyviton.Sprunger, Dutch Puritanism, p. 50; Google Books. This was the so-called Ancient Church, of Ainsworth, Francis Johnson and George Johnson.Sprunger, Trumpets, p. 47; Google Books. Slade then withdrew from the Brownist congregation, which excommunicated him; one of the points at issue was the Dutch approach to infant baptism.Sprunger, Dutch Puritanism, p. 96; Google Books. In 1605 he helped set up the English Reformed Church in Amsterdam, though he was not himself a member of it; Slade lobbied to have Broughton as minister there, but Broughton preferred Middelburg. John Paget took the position.Sprunger, Trumpets, p. 51; Google Books. Slade joined the Dutch Reformed Church, and in 1611 an attempt to have him as an elder of the English Reformed Church failed.Sprunger, Dutch Puritanism, p. 92; Google Books. In 1618 Slade was reconciled in Amsterdam with Francis Johnson, who had moved to Emden, and who died soon after.Keith L. Sprunger, Dutch Puritanism, p. 67; Google Books. =Religious controversialist and informant= Slade threw himself into the Arminian controversy. He corresponded with the Contra-Remonstrant leader Sibrand Lubbertus at Franeker University from 1611 to 20 August 1620. When in 1611 Conrad Vorstius was appointed successor to Jacobus Arminius as theological professor at the University of Leiden, Slade wrote an attack on him, Cum Conrado Vorstio (1612),Cum Conrado Vorstio de Blasphemiis Hæresibus & Atheismis a rege Jacobo I in ejusdem Vorstii de Deo Tractatu & Exegesi apologeticâ nigro theta notatis, Scholasticæ Disceptationis Pars Prima, Amsterdam, 1612; Pars Altera, Amsterdam, 1614. the second volume being published by his associate Jodocus Hondius the Younger.Nijenhuis, p. 104 note 2; Google Books. Vorstius was compelled by the States of Holland, at James I's instigation, to quit Leiden in 1612. Vorstius had been dislodged from his chair at Leiden, but the debate around him was by no means over. Hugo Grotius, the prominent Remonstrant, had visited England in 1613, and Dutch Calvinist preachers wished to diminish his influence there. Johannes Regius of London prompted Slade to act; via Simon Ruytingius in London a copy of a book by Lubbertus against Vorstius reached George Abbot. Later in the year Ralph Winwood and Horace Vere paid an extended call to Slade to obtain his views. Slade was also closely involved with the preparation of the Responsio ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii of Lubbertus which was a reply to the Ordinum Pietas of Grotius, supplying corrections, asking for a sharper attack, and involving Petrus Plancius and Festus Hommius.Nijenhuis, p. 16; Google Books. As a side issue, the reputation of Erasmus was called into question by Slade, who associated him polemically with some heretical positions, while suggesting he would have enjoyed his popularity with the Remonstrant faction. Grotius defended Erasmus as a true reformer;Gregory D. Dodds, Exploiting Erasmus: the Erasmian legacy and religious change in early modern England (2009), p. 187; Google Books. in private to Vossius he wrote that Slade was best ignored.Guillaume Henri Marie Posthumus Meyjes, Henk J. M. Nellen, Edwin Rabbie, Hugo Grotius, theologian: essays in honour of G. H. M. Posthumus Meyjes (1994), p. 92; Google Books. Grotius and Vossius were both outraged by the imputations, in the second part of Slade's attack on Vorstius, but it was Caspar Barlaeus who blasted Slade in his Bogermannus elenchomenos (1615).Edwin Rabbie, Ordinum Hollandiae ac Westfrisiae Pietas (1613) (1995), p. 67; Google Books. In 1614 Slade was involved in further controversy with Rem Bisschop, another Remonstrant, at the house of his relation by marriage Plancius.Nijenhuis, p. 15; Google Books. When the debate became important to diplomacy, Slade passed intelligence to Sir Dudley Carleton, who was English ambassador at The Hague from 1616. Slade sent to Carleton a work on the Arminian controversy early in 1618. He went to Francis Johnson's funeral, and reported to Carleton on Johnson's final views on Arminianism, as presented in his book The Christian Plea.Burgess, p. 190; archive.org. The older interpretations, by Edward Arber and Henry Morton Dexter, of Slade's testimony about Johnson have been contested.Scott Culpepper, Francis Johnson and the English Separatist Influence: The Bishop of Brownism's Life, Writings, and Controversies (2011), p. 246; Google Books. Slade also kept in touch with John Robinson and his congregation. He acted as an intermediary with John Burges, a critic of Robinson.Burgess, p. 97; archive.org. In September 1619 Carleton wished to track down William Brewster, the future Pilgrim Father; Slade located him as somewhere in Leiden.Burgess, p. 174; =Death= Slade died on 10 February 1628, and was buried in the Zuiderkerk.Nijenhuis, p. 6; Google Books. Family Slade married, on 20 September 1593, Alethea (Allis), daughter of Richard Kirford, near Honiton. She died in 1608. He then married, later in the year, Suzanna de Kampenaer, who was step-daughter of Petrus Plancius. They had four children, before Suzanna died in 1614. He married twice more. Slade's son Cornelius Slade, born at Amsterdam on 14 October 1599, was professor of Hebrew and other languages there, and became rector of the academy on 9 May 1628, perhaps following his father. He married Gertrude, daughter of Luke Ambrose, an English preacher there, and was father of Matthew Slade (1628–1689), born 9 June 1628 in England, who became a physician. Under the anagram of Theodorus ‘Aldes,’ Matthew wrote ‘Dissertatio epistolica de Generatione Animalium contra Harveium’ (Amsterdam, 1666; reprinted twice at Frankfurt in 1668), and was author of several medical treatises. Matthew died on 20 December 1689.

It thrives in warmer conditions and is found primarily in Mediterranean countries, although it can also be found in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Transcaucasia, Caucasus, and the western part of Russia. It feeds on dried fruits, carobs, nuts and seeds, hence earning its colloquial name. This diet damages the food industry, and it is a common storage pest. Because of this, much research has been done to study ways to limit its reproduction rate and population size. It was first described by Achille Guenée in 1845.  Taxonomy and phylogenetics  Cadra calidella (Guen.) is a member of the family Pyralidae. A synonym is Ephestia calidella—Cadra and Ephestia are closely related and may be junior synonyms. The names are often used interchangeably, and typically both are used to reference the same organism.  Description and identification  The moth is a brown-gray color. The top portion of its wings have a darker-peppered appearance, while the bottom portion is a lighter gray shade and more translucent. When the wings are folded in, the bottom portion is hidden such that the moth has a mostly dark and peppered look.Deutschland, Schleswig-Holstein, Norderstedt, Raupenfund am 18. Dezember 2010 in einer Packung Frischdatteln aus Tunesien (gekauft im Dezember 2010), e.l. 7. Februar 2011 (leg., cult. & Foto: Sabine Flechtmann), det. Nikolai Savenkov Its abdomen is thin and segmented, approximately 10 mm in length. The female is larger than the male with a wingspan of 19–23 mm, while the wingspan of the male is 17–21 mm.  Distribution and habitat  The moth mostly presides in Mediterranean countries, although it can be found in other parts of Europe due to the transport of the carobs and dried fruits on which it feeds. It can also be found in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Transcaucasia, Caucasus, and the western part of Russia. It thrives at temperatures above 14 °C. The optimal temperature ranges from 25–29 °C.R.W. Howe (1965). A summary of estimates of optimal and minimal conditions for population increase of some stored products insects.—J. stored Prod. Res. 1(2), 177–184. The larva will enter diapause when temperatures have dropped below 24°, and will spend the winter months in hibernation.P.F. Prevett (1968). Some laboratory observations on the life- cycle of Cadra calidella (Guen.) (Lepidoptera, Phyatidae).—J. stored Prod. Res. 4(3), 237. Its habitat range is limited by this temperature sensitivity.  Feeding  Cadra calidella (Guen.) feeds on ripe carob pods and dried fruits before harvest. It will also feed on nuts and seeds. It commonly feeds on dates, thus lending to its common name, “the date moth.” It is considered in Mediterranean countries, such as Cyprus, to be a storage food pest and a threat to that industry.P.D. Cox (1975). The suitability of dried fruits, almonds, and carobs for the development of Ephestia figulilella Gregson, E. calidella (Guenee) and E. cautella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae).—J. stored Prod. Res. 11(3–4), 229. As part of this problem, the moths have been imported to other European countries such as Britain in fruit storage crates. During infestation, the larva will burrow a small hold, typically near the stalk of the fruit.Hans Strümpel (1969). Die tierischen Schädlinge der Dattelpalme Phoenix dactylifera L. und ihrer Früchte in Nordafrika.—Journal of Applied Entomology 64(1–4), 233–240. The feces of the larva can be identified at the entrance of the hole. The fruit will appear not only smaller in size, but also discolored from a green shade to a gray-brown one. Once the larva have finished feeding, they will emerge from their feeding tunnels and begin wandering on the surface of the fruit, an indication that pupation and diapause will begin soon. Carob pods and leaves in majorca arp Their feeding period lasts for 20 to 21 days, during which the young larvae will tunnel into the food, lining the feeding-tunnels with thick layers of silk.P.D. Cox (1974). The influence of temperature and humidity on the life-cycles of Ephestia figulilella gregson and Ephestia calidella (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae).—J. stored Prod. Res. 10(1), 46. While the tunnels may initially be 2 cm deep, later instar larva will tunnel deeper. In experiments they have been found to tunnel up to 6 cm deep.  Life cycle  = Eggs = Adult Cadra calidella lay their eggs on the surface of the dried fruit or carob before harvest. The eggs are laid in no particular fashion or intentional organization. The development following the hatching of the egg is most rapid at 30 °C. = Larvae = The larval period coincides with the feeding period, which typically lasts between 20 and 21 days. Following the feeding period, the larva then enters a wandering period during which the larva will move out of the food. The larvae period will last between 2 and 6 days. = Pre-pupa = After the last instar larva finds a location to begin diapause, it will spin a cocoon for itself. In laboratory experiments, the larva will wander several centimeters above the food layer before finding a satisfactory location to pupate. Once the last instar larva begins to diapause, it will spin itself a thin silk cocoon. = Pupa = The pupal period lasts typically around 5 days, although this period may vary with temperature (with the shortest time of diapause being at 30 °C). Pupal death increases in frequency as the temperature rises above 30 °C, and Franquiera (1955) observed that pupa did not enter into diapause until the temperatures have begun to dip below 24 °C. Hibernation in the cocoon occurs during the winter months, during which the appropriate temperatures are achieved for diapause. However, there are some larva that do not diapause in the cocoon, but simply cling to the spun silk they produced during their wandering period as a larva.P.D. Cox (1975). The influence of photoperiod on the life-cycles of Ephestia calidella (Guenee) and Ephestia figulilella Gregson (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae).—J. stored Prod. Res. 11(2), 77. Additionally, these larva may occasionally shift locations, albeit for short periods of time. Laboratory experiments will assume pupation through the observation that the pupa has not moved and has not pupated at a fixed age. = Adult = The moth will hatch into an adult approximately 30 to 44 days after the eggs were initially laid.  Hibernation and migration  Cadra calidella larva will hibernate during the winter months, usually between the months of September to April – this has been observed in both Portugal and Cyprus. Hibernation was observed to begin when temperatures have begun to fall below 24 °C with humidity above 60%. Due to these specific temperature conditions for moth hibernation, the species can only reproduce a limited amount of time during the year and will often only produce one or two generations during that time. Cadra calidella does not typically migrate during winter months; instead, they will hibernate inside their cocoon. The moth will oftentimes be relocated from the Mediterranean countries to other areas in Europe through the transportation of carobs and dried fruits in the food industry.  Mating  During mating, the female moth will adopt a calling position, during which she will expose her pheromone gland located underneath her abdomen to attract a male moth. This occurs during the dark period under laboratory conditions and at the dusk and dawn under natural lighting. In response to the female’s calling behavior, a male can respond in typical courtship behavior such as moving his antenna, raising his head or thorax, and fluttering his wings.Magdia A.M. Hazaa, Alm El-Din M. M. S., and Amira, A. Mikhaiel (2012). Impact of Gamma Radiation on Sex Pheromone Gland of Female and Male Response of Ephestia calidella (Guen.).—J. Rad. Res. Appl. Sci. 5(3), 463. Following courting, the male will fly to the female for copulation. Mating can occur for a duration of a few minutes to over 6 hours. An increase in male C. calidella population occurs during early April to mid- November. In laboratory studies, irradiating male moths led to a decrease in sexual competitiveness.S.A. Boshra and A.A. Mikhaiel (2006). Effect of gamma irradiation on pupal stage of Ephestia calidella (Guenee) —Journal of Stored Products Research 42(4), 457–467.  Parental care  Copulation occurs after courtship has ended, during which the female will resume a calling position to release sex pheromones and the male will respond positively, eventually flying to the female. Copulation is more likely to occur between a male and a virgin female, as her sex pheromone is more concentrated than that of a mated female. Copulation would last from a range of a few minutes to over 6 hours, after which oviposition would begin likewise during dark conditions. Due to the temperature sensitivity of diapause, oviposition occurs only once or twice a year, producing only one or two generations in a year. Eggs were laid on the surface of the carob or dried fruits, in no particular pattern or organized fashion.  Physiology  = Pheromone production = Female C. calidella will produce sex pheromones to attract male moths during mating and courtship. In the calling position, the female will expose her pheromone gland, which is between the eighth and ninth segments of the abdomen. It is in the pattern of an inverted ‘V,’ and is covered by hairs. The hairs themselves will become more sparse to allow for both greater rates of evaporation of the pheromone into the air and greater likelihood of forming droplets. The glands are surrounded by pouch-like structures that are pulled on by round muscles, allow the female to control the exposure or hiding of the pheromone gland. The male can the respond positively with typical courtship behavior – the likelihood of a positive response increased with increasing concentration of female sex pheromone produced. Virgin females will produce a great concentration of sex pheromone compared to females who have already mated. Males may have thus increased their reproductive fitness by mating with virgins as cued by the females’ pheromone concentrations.  Competition for resources  Overcrowding of C. calidella is of particular interest in studies due to the desire to limit the population sizes of the storage pests in order to minimize the damage accumulated by the moths. However, there is an optimum population density of moths, such that the highest level of food consumption was determined to be 5 larva per culture.Monir M. Metwally, M.A. Ali, A.K. Abdel- Salam and A.E. Hussain. Factors Affecting Feeding Activity and Dates Loss by Cadra calidella Larvae (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).—Dept. of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture. 136. At this level, the greatest amount of food was consumed. When the density was doubled, the amount of food consumed was halved, as competition for food increased. Mortality rates increased, likely to be attributed to hunger in individuals from food competition. Therefore, a decrease in moth populations may potentially cause greater food loss to the carob and dried fruit industry as the optimal population size is approached. In addition to food consumption, adult emergence is also affected by population density and competition. While cultures with high densities numerically resulted in a greater magnitude of adults emerging, the ratio of emergent adults to the original population size decreased as the population density increased, such that the lowest percentage of emergent adults was at 40 larva per colony.  Enemies  Bracon hebetorWhile there are limited resources on the predation of Cadra calidella, laboratory experiments will often encounter diseased moths due to parasitism by Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner). This bacterium is a common parasite to other moths as well. In the lab, quarantine methods and other precautions can be taken to prevent further infection of moths. Another parasitoid, Bracon hebetor, is found to target Cadra calidella as well as other related moths. This parasitoid, along with pheromone traps, have been employed as tactics to control the reproduction of the moth due to its threat to the dried fruit industry.A.A. Hameed, A.A. Al- Taweel, Ibrahim Al-Jboory, and Sh. M. Al-Zaidy (2011). Using the Parasitoid, Bracon hebetor Say. and the Pheromone Traps to Control the Moth Insects, Ephestia spp. In Date Stores in Iraq.—Egyptian journal of pest control vol. 21. The larva can be examined for signs of disease – a diseased larva will often be delayed in development, such that individuals will not emerge even after 140 days of the egg hatching.  Interaction with humans  Cadra calidella is most commonly identified as a storage pest moth, primarily in Mediterranean countries where dried fruits and carobs is a larger industry. Not only do they attack the crops before the harvest, but they will also infest products in stores. In Cyprus, the moths will often infest the country’s carob stores. Their prevalence as a pest has prompted much of the research that has been done on the moth. = Methods of pest control = Because the Cadra species and difficult to distinguish, many of the chemical pest control applications in the past failed to distinguish across different pests. Control programs, such as the integrated pest management (IPM) project was started by the Extension Service in Upper Galilee. The project combines pest control efforts with research, and has reached out to growers to form local and regional pest scouts. This project has led to 30–50% reductions in pesticide usage. Much research has since followed to not only identify the major pests but also to understand their physiology and how their development changes upon certain changes. Research on Cadra calidella including changing temperature, photoperiods, humidity, gamma radiation, and parasitoids. Previous chemical control methods have largely been substituted with other pest control methods such as insect-proof screens, localized application of pesticides depending on the timeline of the moth’s life cycle, sex pheromone traps, and usage of parasitoids.Reuben Ausher (1997). Implementation of Integrated Pest Management. Phytoparasitica25(2):119–141.

Feuds in the United States deals with the phenomena of historic blood feuding in America. These feuds have been numerous and some became quite vicious. Often, a conflict which may have started out as a rivalry between two individuals or families became further escalated into a clan-wide feud or a range war, involving dozens—or even hundreds—of participants. Below are listed some of the most notable blood feuds in United States history, most of which occurred in the Old West. Early–Hasley A family feud that took place immediately following the American Civil War, in Bell County, Texas from 1865 to 1869, the Early and Hasley families and their allies found themselves extending the ideological battle of that recent conflict. John Early, a supporter of the federal officials then occupying Texas, was an early member of the Texas Home Guard. He was having repeated run-ins with Drew Hasley, an older local citizen who had been a staunch Confederacy backer. When Hasley's son, Samuel, returned from service in the war, he became active in the conflict with Early, escalating the feud. When the younger Hasley brought a local outlaw, Jim McRae, into the fight, Early sought federal troop intervention, which was granted. On July 30, 1869, McRae was ambushed and killed. Dr. Calvin Clark, an Early ally, was gunned down shortly afterward in Arkansas. The Hasley supporters soon disbanded and the feud faded. Hatfield–McCoy Perhaps the most infamous feud in the history of the U.S., the Hatfield–McCoy conflict is now an icon of American folklore. The Hatfields, of West Virginia, were led by William Anderson \\"Devil Anse\\" Hatfield. The McCoys, of Kentucky, were under the leadership of Randolph \\"Ole Ran’l\\" McCoy. The feud began after the killing of Asa Harmon McCoy, an ex-Union soldier, who was gunned down on January 7, 1865, while hiding in a cave. McCoy died at the hands of a group of Hatfield allies, and Confederate irregulars (named the \\"Logan Wildcats\\"), who had tracked him to his hiding place. The conflict was renewed thirteen years later when two McCoy family members killed a witness (who was related to both families) and who had testified against them in a court case involving ownership of a stray pig. The simmering feud escalated soon afterward, when Roseanna McCoy began a courtship with Johnson \\"Johnse\\" Hatfield, Devil Anse's son. Roseanna left her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. In 1881, when Johnse abandoned the pregnant Roseanna, marrying her cousin instead, the bitterness between the two families grew. In 1882, Ellison Hatfield, brother of Devil Anse Hatfield, was killed in an election-day dispute by three of Roseanna's brothers, who themselves were killed by a Hatfield-led mob while in the custody of the law. Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country. The feud reached its peak during the so-called 1888 New Years Night Massacre. Several of the Hatfield gang surrounded the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family. The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randolph McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break, but two of his children were murdered, and his wife was beaten and left for dead. In 1888, Wall Hatfield and eight others were arrested and ordered to stand trial for the New Years Night murders. Seven received life imprisonment, while the eighth, Ellison \\"Cottontop\\" Mounts, was executed by hanging.Rice p. 111. Fighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts. Trials, however, continued for several years, with the trial of Johnse Hatfield the last, in 1901. Lee–Peacock The Lee–Peacock feud took place in the four-corners area of the Texas counties of Fannin, Grayson, Collin, and Hunt. It became a local, four-year extension of the American Civil War - lasting from 1867 to 1871 - in which an estimated 50 men lost their lives. When the war broke out, a resident of the area, Bob Lee, immediately joined the Confederate Army, leaving his wife, three children, and his home in the care of his father Daniel. Near the end of the war, word reached Lee that a Union sympathizer, Lewis Peacock, had set up an organization in his home which was actively working for the protection of blacks and Union sympathizers. This was \\"The Union League\\", in Pilot Grove, Texas, less than seven miles from Lee's home. By the time that Lee and other ex-Confederate soldiers of the area returned to their homes in northeast Texas, the region was already roiling in conflict, as most area residents resented the intrusion of the Reconstruction soldiers stationed throughout the state. Lee's doctor was murdered by Hugh Hudson, another Peacock sympathizer, and the feud immediately escalated. Hudson, the doctor's killer, was himself quickly killed, as were other combatants. Many were wounded, including Peacock. By the summer of 1868, the conflict had become so heated that Peacock requested help from the federal government, which promptly posted a $1,000 reward for Bob Lee's capture. The U.S. Cavalry, acting on a tip from an informant, shot Lee down on May 24, 1869; however, the fighting still continued. It wasn't until Lewis Peacock was himself killed, on June 13, 1871, that the feud ended. Sutton–Taylor John Wesley Hardin joined the Sutton-Taylor Feud at the behest of his cousin, Emanuel \\"Mannen\\" Clements. This notorious range war began as a county law enforcement issue between the Taylor family, headed by Pitkin Taylor, brother of Creed Taylor, a renowned Texas Ranger, and local lawman William E. Sutton, a former Confederate soldier, who had moved with his family to DeWitt County, Texas, originally intending to simply raise cattle. The feud, which lasted a decade and cost at least 35 lives, has been called the longest and bloodiest in Texas history. It eventually involved the Texas State Police, the Texas Rangers, and the outlaw John Wesley Hardin. Sutton had become a deputy sheriff in Clinton, Texas, and on March 25, 1868, he shot and killed a Taylor kinsman, Charley Taylor, whom he was trying to arrest for horse theft. The following Christmas Eve, Sutton killed Buck Taylor and Dick Chisholm in a saloon in Clinton, after an argument regarding the sale of some horses. On August 23, 1869, the Sutton faction was suspected of the ambush and killing of Jack Hays Taylor. In July 1870, Sutton was appointed to the State Police Force, serving under Captain Jack Helm (sometimes Helms). The police force was tasked with enforcing the \\"Reconstruction\\" policies of the federal government, but operated with somewhat of a free-hand, and more often than not returned with wanted suspects dead. On August 26, 1870, the Suttons were allegedly sent to arrest Henry and his brother William Kelly, who were both related by marriage to Pitkin Taylor, on a trivial charge. However, rather than arresting the men, the Suttons shot the Kellys. Due to his handling of the affair, Helm was dismissed from the State Police Force, though cleared of any wrongdoing. =John Wesley Hardin joins the feud= In early 1872, on-the-run outlaw John Wesley Hardin joined his cousin, Mannen Clements, in neighboring Gonzales County, Texas. There, Clements and his brothers were active in the cattle rustling or herding business working for Taylor family friends. On May 15, 1873, Sutton family allies Jim Cox and Jake Christman were killed by the Taylor faction during a gunfight at Tomlinson Creek. Hardin later admitted that there were reports that he had led the fight in which these two men were killed, but would neither confirm nor deny his involvement. Two days later, in a May 17, 1873, gunfight, Hardin killed Dewitt County deputy sheriff, J.B. Morgan—serving under Helm, who was now sheriff of DeWitt County. Hardin played a part in the assassination later that same day of Sheriff Helm in Albuquerque, Texas. Hardin, Helm and Sam McCracken Jr. were gathered together talking in front of a blacksmith shop. Helm was unarmed, having left his revolvers at Mrs. McCracken's boarding house, where he was then residing. James Taylor advanced on Helm from behind and attempted to discharge his revolver, but it misfired. As Helm turned, Taylor fired again, this time striking Helm in the chest. Helm rushed Taylor with the intent to grapple with him, but Hardin discharged a double barrel shotgun, shattering his arm. As Helm attempted to flee into the blacksmith shop, Hardin held townspeople at gunpoint while Taylor unloaded the remaining five bullets from his revolver into him. As Hardin and Taylor mounted their horses and prepared to ride away, they boasted that they had accomplished what they had come to do. The next night, Hardin and other Taylor supporters surrounded the ranch house of Sutton family ally, Joe Tumlinson. A shouted truce was arranged and both sides signed a peace treaty in Clinton, Texas. However, within a year, violence once again broke out between the two sides. The feud reached its apex when Jim and his cousin Bill Taylor gunned down Billy Sutton and a friend, Gabriel Slaughter, as they waited on a steamboat platform, in Indianola, Texas on March 11, 1874. Tired of the feud, Billy Sutton had been planning to leave the area for good. In retaliation, the Sutton faction caught and lynched three of the Taylor group, on June 22, 1874. After this, the fighting continued, though with much less frequency. Jim Taylor was killed January 1, 1875. On November 17, 1875, Reuben H. Brown, the new leader of the Suttons and ex-marshal of Cuero, Texas, was shot down in the Exchange Saloon by Hardin, his last known action in the feud. In October 1876, after another outbreak of violence, Texas Ranger, Captain Jesse Lee Hall, led a force into Cuero, Texas to break up the feud for good. By January 1877, he and his supporting troop had put an end to the conflict. Horrell–Higgins Governor Edmund J. Davis founded the Texas State Police to combat lawlessness. The Horrell and Higgins families had both settled in the Lampasas County, Texas area several years before the American Civil War. By all accounts, the two families got along well for over a decade. However, by the early 1870s, the five 'Horrell boys': Mart, Tom, Merritt, Ben and Sam had been involved in numerous lawless activities. In January 1873, Lampasas County Sheriff, Shadrick T. Denson, attempted to arrest two brothers, Wash and Mark Short, who were friends of the Horrell family. Intervention by the Horrell brothers resulted in a gunfight in which Sheriff Denson was shot and killed. A county judge appealed to Texas Governor, Edmund J. Davis, for help. The Texas State Police dispatched a number of lawmen to the area to maintain order. On March 14, 1873, state officers Wesley Cherry, Jim Daniels, and Andrew Melville arrested Bill Bowen, a brother-in-law to the Horrell brothers, for carrying a firearm (which Governor Davis had recently outlawed in the area). The officers then entered Jerry Scott's Saloon with Bowen in tow. After a verbal exchange with the Horrell brothers, who had been inside the saloon, a gunfight ensued. Four of the officers were killed, including Capt. Williams. Williams had managed to shoot and badly wound Mart Horrell, and his brother, Tom Horrell, was also among the wounded. Following the gunfight, more state police were sent to the county. Mart Horrell and three friends were arrested and taken to the Georgetown, Texas jail. However, a large crowd of Horrell family friends broke into the jail and freed them. The brothers fled to Lincoln County, New Mexico, where later that same year, Ben Horrell was himself killed after he murdered a local law enforcement officer. In early February 1874, the brothers returned to Lampasas, but were no longer welcome. Shortly after their return, local rancher, John \\"Pink\\" Higgins, accused the Horrell brothers of rustling some of his cattle. The brothers were arrested, but were quickly acquitted. Although things were tense between the two families, no actions were taken by either side at that time. The feud quickly escalated, when, on January 22, 1877 (while in the Wiley and Toland's Gem Saloon in Lampasas), John Higgins shot and killed Merritt Horrell in a gunfight. The three remaining Horrell brothers vowed revenge. On March 26, 1877, Tom and Mart Horrell were shot and wounded in an ambush, but both survived. John Higgins and Bob Mitchell were arrested for the action, but later acquitted. =Shootout at the Lampasas town square= On June 7, 1877, John Higgins rode into Lampasas accompanied by: brother-in-law, Bob Mitchell; Mitchell's brother, Frank; a friend, Bill Wren; and another brother-in-law, Ben Terry. The Horrell brothers and several friends were already in town, gathered at the town square. It is unknown who fired first, but it is believed that someone within the Horrell faction opened fire on the Higgins group. When the gunfight ended, Bill Wren had been wounded, Frank Mitchell had been killed, and Horrell faction members, Buck Waltrup and Carson Graham, had been killed. All three Horrell brothers were arrested, and Texas Ranger, Major John B. Jones, acted as a mediator between the remaining members of the two factions. Less than one year later, Mart and Tom Horrell were arrested in Meridian, Texas for armed robbery and murder. While confined to the local jail, vigilantes broke in and shot and killed them both. Sam was the only remaining Horrell brother. He moved his family to Oregon in 1882, thus marking an end to the feud. Lincoln County Feud The Lincoln County Feud occurred in the Harts Creek community of Lincoln and Logan counties, West Virginia, between 1878 and 1890. Initially a personal vendetta between prominent residents Paris Brumfield and Canaan Adkins, the feud culminated in a bitter war between local timber barons and businessmen, including Allen Brumfield, John W. Runyon, and Benjamin Adams. The feud resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries and scuffles between factions, nationwide press coverage, and the extermination/out-migration of several key participants. It has been memorialized in at least one ballad and play, as well as through music recorded by John Hartford. Feud descendant and author Brandon Ray Kirk has written a history of the feud titled Blood in West Virginia: Brumfield v. McCoy, which draws primarily upon twenty years of research including oral histories with other feud descendants, newspaper accounts, and courthouse documents. Earp–Clanton Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton (left to right) in the window of the undertakers following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The Earp vendetta ride arose as a result of coordinated attacks (in December 1881 and again in March 1882) against the Earp brothers. These ambushes were in retaliation for their involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in Tombstone, Arizona. =Gunfight at the O.K. Corral= The noted gun-battle had occurred on October 26, 1881, and was itself the climax of the Earp–Clanton family feud, simmering since the summer of 1880. Tensions between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys increased through 1881, culminating in the historic gunfight. At the O.K. Corral, three deputized Earp brothers, Wyatt, Morgan and Virgil, along with Doc Holliday, had killed Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury. The Clanton and McLaury families were aligned with the \\"Outlaw Cowboys\\", a loosely knit outlaw group of families, friends and acquaintances then living in surrounding Cochise and Pima counties. =Earp Vendetta Ride= The Earp Vendetta ride was a manhunt for the \\"Outlaw Cowboys\\" that Wyatt Earp held responsible for the maiming of his brother Virgil (the police chief of Tombstone, Arizona as well as a Deputy U.S. Marshal) the previous December,NOTE: Wyatt Earp, another target of the December ambush, was unharmed. and the recent assassination of his brother Morgan (also an assistant U.S. Marshal) the week before. When several suspects in the attacks were set free by the court − some owing to legal technicalities and others based on the strength of alibis provided by sympathetic confederates – Wyatt Earp decided he could not rely on civil justice, and took matters into his own hands. On March 20, 1882, a newly deputized United States Marshal Wyatt Earp formed a federal posse that began to scour Cochise and Pima counties for the purpose of hunting down and killing the men he thought guilty of the attacks. Wyatt and Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, John \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion, Dan Tipton, Charlie Smith, Fred Dodge, Johnny Green, and Lou Cooley made up the federal posse. The killing began with the March 22, 1882, shooting of Frank Stilwell as he and several Outlaw Cowboys – including Ike Clanton – lay in ambush at the Tucson rail station. The Earp group was escorting the still invalid Virgil Earp, and his wife, to safety so they could be removed from the now dangerous Arizona Territory. Cowboy confederate and Wyatt Earp rival, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, then formed his own posse and deputized a number of the outlaws, including Johnny Ringo, Phineas Clanton, Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men to ride after the federal posse and the five men \\"wanted\\" for the shooting of Stilwell. Carrying federal arrest warrants for the assassins, the federal posse killed four men. The vendetta ride ended with the killing of \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius and Johnny Ringo on April 15, 1882. The Earps and their associates then quickly headed for the New Mexico Territory, leaving Arizona Territory, and the feuding behind. Brooks–McFarland A family feud taking place between 1896 and 1902, centered in the Creek Nation of the old Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). It began with the death of Thomas Brooks on August 24, 1896. Brooks was killed during a botched holdup which was to originally include some members of the McFarland family in its execution. The Brooks family blamed the McFarland family for the death, and there followed a series of confrontations between the two clans that culminated in the historic shootout at Spokogee (now Dustin), Oklahoma on September 22, 1902. During the gunfight, family patriarch, Willis Brooks, and his son, Clifton were killed, as well as McFarland family associate, George Riddle. John Brooks, brother of Clifton, lay seriously wounded. Survivors Jim and Joe McFarland, Alonzo Riddle (George's brother), and the wounded John Brooks, were arrested pending murder charges, though all were quickly released on bail. The feud ended on October 10, 1902 when Jim McFarland was ambushed and killed near his home, possibly at the hands of Sam Baker, a Brooks ally. John Brooks left the area after recuperating from his wounds. Remaining Brooks brother, Henry, left the area soon after serving time for a subsequent arrest for horse theft. He died violently in a shootout with Alabama law enforcement in 1911. Sam Baker was killed October 7, 1911 by the son of an irate shopkeeper he had previously confronted. Willis Brooks' widow and family matriarch, \\"Old Jenny\\" Brooks, died on March 29, 1924, at the age of ninety-eight, and is said to have been proud that all of her sons had \\"died like men, with their boots on.'Butler, pg. 50-52 The members of McFarland faction were acquitted of any wrongdoing after the fight and continued living in the Dustin area. Reese–Townsend Captain Bill McDonald of the Texas Rangers helped put an end to the Reese- Townsend feud. The Reese–Townsend conflict, also called the Colorado County Feud, was a politically motivated feud which took place in the closing days of the Old West. The events of the conflict were centered in Columbus, Texas, but involved other parts of Colorado County before it was over. The feud ran from 1898 through 1907. The feud resulted from a local political race that placed incumbent Sheriff Sam Reese against a former deputy sheriff, Larkin Hope. Former U.S. senator, Mark Townsend, was a power-broker who had been the deciding factor for several past contests for sheriff. He had pulled his support away from Reese, supporting Hope instead. This led to tensions between those in support of Reese, and the Townsend faction. When Hope was assassinated in downtown Columbus before the election was held, suspicion immediately fell on the Reese allies. Townsend's hand-picked replacement candidate, Will Burford, won the election. On March 16, 1899, Reese was killed in a gunfight (provoked by him) with Townsend allies, and Reese's family vowed revenge.*Columbus Texas Online History Columbus, TX History From May 17, 1899 to May 17, 1907, five additional gunfights took place in the area, with the results that Dick Reese (Sam's brother), Arthur Burford, Hiram Clements and Jim Coleman lost their lives in the violence. Legendary Texas Ranger, Captain Bill McDonald, along with officer James Brooks and others, were dispatched to the area to restore order, and ended the fighting.

He came to power when he came of age in 1584. He founded the first Gymnasium Illustrie in the margraviate. His conversion from the Lutheranism to Calvinism and his occupation of Upper Baden caused serious conflicts – even with the Emperor – the consequences of which damaged Lower Baden and ultimately also led to losses of territory.

It had three founder members; Robin Skelton, poet and professor of English at Manchester University, Tony Connor, poet and Michael Neville Seward Snow, painter. Their objective was to bring together the isolated people who were writing and working in the visual arts within the region, and to provide a forum for discussion and exhibition of their work.  Historical background  The first meeting was held in May 1957 in a hired room above the Town Hall Hotel, a Victorian gothic public house in Tib Lane adjacent to Albert Square, - and close to St Peter's Square where in 1819 the infamous Peterloo Massacre had taken place, and from which the group took its name. The first discussion was on the subject of ‘The Social Position of the Arts Today’. Meetings continued on a monthly basis with writers and artists talking about their work and inviting discussion. Amongst the poets leading meetings, were Tony Connor, Michael Dixon, David Dunn, Michael Holroyd, John Knight, Jack Marriott, John McDonald, Robin Skelton, Margaret Snow, Noel Varney and Bernadette Wiseman. Several exhibitions of painting and sculpture were organized showing members work; the lounge of the nearby Library Theatre being a popular exhibition space. Exhibitors included Michael Snow, Tony Connor, Donald McKenna, Noel Varney and Laurence Whitfield alongside works by the specially invited guests; L. S. Lowry and Cliff Holden. By 1959 the group had gained considerable status in art ‘scene’ of Manchester, enhanced even more so with the co-operation of the University Extra-Mural Department and enabling the arrangement of events such as a public lecture by Sir Geoffrey Keynes on the work of William Blake. This co-operation, along with the support of the Vice Chancellor of the University, led to meetings between the group and interested parties from the City of Manchester and cleared the way for the formation of the Manchester Institute of Contemporary Arts (‘MICA’), and, with several members moving away from the City, the dissolution of the group in 1960.

Surname origin  The Rieussec family's birthplace was the town of Lespinassière. Nicolas was the son of Joseph Rieussec, a merchant born in the 18th century in Lespinassière, in Languedoc, then one of the largest provinces in the kingdom of France. Today, Lespinassière is located in Aude, one of the five départements of the Languedoc-Roussillon region.  Ancestry  Joseph Rieussec was in Paris at the end of 1778, although no one knows when he left his birthplace, the town of Lespinassière, for the kingdom's capital. His wife, Jeanne Michateau, was expecting. On January 20, 1779, she gave birth to their first son, Nicolas Joseph. On July 20, 1781, a few years before the outbreak of a revolution that was to lead to an upheaval in France and all of Europe, a younger brother arrived and was named Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec. The baby was baptised three days after his birth in the parish of Sainte-Marie du Temple. Nicolas Mathieu Bogganio, a banker residing on the Rue des Victoires in Paris, stood godfather, and the godmother was Marie Victoire Griveau, also residing on the Rue des Victoires. Joseph Rieussec held a literary salon. On an unknown date, probably between 1786 and 1788, he remarried Cécile Paillard. The family grew with the arrival of a third child, Lucile Clotilde Cécile, born on October 25, 1788. She died in 1818. Joseph Rieussec died in 1838. Nicolas Mathieu was born in Paris. Several sources put his birth in Toulouse, sometimes on September 1, 1781, which is not supported by any documents. In contrast, the royal warrant naming Nicolas Mathieu a Watchmaker to the King, is accompanied by a baptismal certificate from the registry of the Sainte- Marie-du-Temple parish in Paris. Early years Still a minor, young Rieussec was set up as a watchmaker at no. 14, Rue du Marché-Palu, on the Île de la Cité. The Almanac du commerce de Paris pour l’an XIII (Paris Business Yearbook for Year XIII), i.e., 1805, lists 190 watchmakers, including the renowned Breguet. Rieussec does not appear. In contrast, five years later, he is listed among the 222 watchmakers in Paris. He did business at no. 14, Rue du Marché- Palu. Married to Anne Marie Delan, he had a son named Joseph-Ferdinand, born on December 15, 1804, a few days after Napoleon was crowned Emperor of the French. Two years later, Rieussec became a widower. His wife, born July 21, 1780, died on May 1, 1806. Less than a year later, on February 7, 1807, Nicolas Mathieu married Marie Pierrette Flore Bourdin in Sainte-Marguerite church. Time passed. The year 1815 and Waterloo arrived, during which Napoleon and his Empire was swept away in defeat.  Watchmaker to the King  With the royalty restored, the throne passed to a Bourbon, Louis XVIII, brother of the late Louis XVI, who had been guillotined in 1793. All indications are that the new king did not consider Rieussec to be a loyal follower of Napoleon, or to have a black mark against his past. From 1817 on, Rieussec practiced his profession at no. 13, Rue Notre-Dame-des-Petits-Champs. Curiously, he also had a currency exchange there for an indeterminate period of time. That same year, the young watchmaker began to gain recognition when he was named a Watchmaker to the King in a royal warrant dated January 31, 1817. > “On this thirty-first day of January, eighteen hundred and seventeen, the > King at Paris, having been made fully aware of the good life and moral > conduct of Sieur Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec, and of the distinguished > reputation he has acquired in his profession of Watchmaker, desires to > confer upon him a mark of his favour and of the protection with which he > honours him; for this purpose, His Majesty has granted and does grant him > the title of his Watchmaker so that said Sieur Rieussec can enjoy all the > honours, prerogatives and other benefits thereunto appertaining; His Majesty > desires and intends that he may use said Title at all gatherings and on all > public documents […].” In 1817, there were already five Watchmakers to the King in Paris: Lepaute, Le Roy, Lépine, Robin, and Lamygonge. Rieussec was the sixth. It was not by chance that this honour had been obtained. Since 1815/1816, Nicolas Mathieu had been entrusted with “maintenance of the clocks for the Minister of the King’s Household,” or in other words the Royal Furniture Depository. Created at the beginning of the 17th century, the Royal Furniture Depository was the government office responsible for managing furniture and artwork used to furnish and decorate the royal residences. An ambitious man, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec did not stop with this warrant. Scarcely had he been named a Watchmaker to the King when he sought another warrant as Watchmaker to the Crown's Furniture Depository. Between May and June 1817, Rieussec sent a letter to the Baron de la Ville d’Avray, the general superintendent of the Royal Furniture Depository. Having worked for the Depository for nearly two years, Rieussec considered that he had a right to this warrant. Such a request was astonishing, as witnessed by the following letter dated May or June 1817. > “Now that Warrants as Watchmakers to the Royal Furniture Depository are > being conferred, he feels that in asking for one, he is requesting only what > is his due, since it is a consequence of his employment. Sieur Rieussec > believes he is all the more justified since, out of six warrants with this > title that were just conferred, only four of the watchmakers are, like > himself, employed by the Royal Furniture Depository, and two (Messrs. Leroy > and Lépine) are not at all, and so have been better treated than him if his > request is not granted. Could the Watchmaker to the King warrant be regarded > as a favour that would cause the other to be refused him? He cannot convince > himself of that, for he values possession of the former too highly to > believe that anyone could consider it a precluding honour. He therefore > believes that the title of Watchmaker to the King does not influence the > question of the other title in the slightest, and that that question is > resolved by the legitimate rights conferred upon him by the duties he > performs. Sieur Rieussec does not seek to hold two titles; his ambition was > satisfied when he was granted the Warrant as Watchmaker to the King. This is > a right that he is asserting now. It is a favour obtained by Messrs. Leroy > and Lépine, who are not employed by the Royal Furniture Depository at all. > In contrast, Sieur Rieussec is indeed one of [His Majesty’s] watchmakers.” He had no choice but to wait, especially since the warrant list for 1817 was already closed. The wait was a short one. In 1818, he was granted a warrant as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository.  The “Chronograph”  Chronograph invented by Nicolas Rieussec, 1821 The decade of the 1820s was one of the most prosperous in Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec's life. It certainly did get off to an auspicious start. September 1, 1821, found Rieussec at the Champ-de-Mars in Paris - not as a race spectator come to watch the Arrondissement de la Seine race, but as a watchmaker testing a “chronometer intended to consistently measure the time horses take to travel the prescribed race distances - not only the winning horse, but also all those that cross the line after it.“Seine département prefecture, Horse races, excerpt from the minutes of the meeting on September 23, 1821, INPI, 1BA1625 Rieussec's presence at the Arrondissement de la Seine race was not by chance. His elder brother, Nicolas Joseph, was an important person in French equestrian circles, which at the time were growing rapidly. Sixteen years earlier, on August 31, 1805, an imperial decree had established horse racing. It was in this context that, before 1805, Nicolas Joseph had founded the Buc stud farm, prior to purchasing that of Viroflay a few years later in 1812. He is also considered the promoter of the thoroughbred in France. Horse racing was the fashion, and young watchmaker Nicolas Mathieu quickly saw it as an opportunity to use his skill. Running the horses and determining the winner was one thing. Being able to measure the time for each of the racers was quite another. At this time, early in the 19th century, the need was felt for an instrument that could accomplish this. On September 1, 1820, many prominent figures had come to the Champ-de-Mars. A practised eye would have recognized Joseph Jérôme, Comte Siméon, Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior; and Gaspard de Chabrol, Prefect of the Seine [département]. Chabrol's support was doubtless unnecessary, since the Minister had expressed his “kindness” to Rieussec the same day, giving him reason to “hope for a patent on the basis of public utility.” Both the Race Jury's report and Prefect Chabrol's letter referred to Rieussec's invention as a “chronometer” or a “timer.” There was as yet no mention of a “chronograph.” The tests were judged to be satisfactory for the time being, as witnessed by the Race Jury's report. Rieussec's invention met a real need. Better yet, it was a comfortable and reliable way to measure the times. Henceforth, there was “no fear of any errors.” It seemed destined for a promising future! = A “Chronograph with Seconds Indicator” = In the minutes of its meeting held October 15, 1821, the French Academy of Sciences reports on Rieussec's invention, which he had presented to them two weeks earlier and which was examined by two of its members, Breguet and Prony. As Rieussec later wrote to Comte Siméon, it was this prestigious company that was the first to call his invention the “Chronograph with Seconds Indicator.” The expression caught on to such a point that it replaced “chronometer” and “timer.” Then and for all time to come, the term became “Rieussec’s chronograph.” Having the Academy's minutes is no small advantage. They provide a description of the chronograph and its operation that is among the most comprehensive in existence: > ”The volume and shape of this instrument are about those of a large pocket > chronometer. The dial is movable and turns about an axis that is > perpendicular to its plane and passes through its centre. When the > Chronograph is operating, this dial makes one revolution per minute, and > since its circumference is divided into 60 parts, the angular motion of one > division corresponds to one second. A small window next to the hanging ring > reveals a number, which is replaced by another number with each revolution > of the dial and indicates the minutes; the Chronograph can run about three- > quarters of an hour without stopping. To use this instrument, when it is > mounted and in a resting state, one first sets the divisions marking the > time to the starting points by turning a knurled knob with one’s hand. > Through the intermediary of a gear train, the knob causes the minute and > second dials to move. Having done this, when the moment to start timing > arrives, one presses a small button next to the knob to set the machine in > motion. The observer can give full attention to the phenomena whose > successive time intervals he wishes to measure, and as soon as one of the > divisions of these intervals is reached, he presses a second button next to > the one we have just mentioned. At the moment when it is pressed a small > pen, or metal point, passing through the open tip of a cone filled with > black oil ink and placed opposite the moving dial’s fixed zero point, marks > a point on the circumference that is divided into seconds. This point then > indicates the second and fraction of a second corresponding to the beginning > or end of the period of time being measured. Operation of the pen trigger > mechanism neither stops nor slows the moving dial’s motion, so the button > can be pressed several times while this motion lasts, making a number of > black points on the scale divided into 60 parts; each point indicates, by > its position, the moment when it was marked. To stop the chronograph > quickly, one need only press the button that started it. The mechanism is > arranged such that pressing this button abruptly changes the current state > of the machine, making it pass from a resting state to movement or from > movement to its resting state. We did not examine the inside of the > instrument, and we do not think that it offers anything particularly > remarkable, given the current state of watchmaking. Its principal merit lies > in its ability to instantly indicate the first and last moments of several > successive time intervals by means of permanent, visible signs on a moving > dial, without requiring the attention of the observer’s eyes or ears. A > chronograph with such a property unquestionably offers precious resources to > physicians, engineers and, in general, anyone who measures phenomena. A > highly satisfactory trial was recently made at public horse races; but its > use can obviously extend to an infinite variety of other kinds of > observations, the testing of moving machines, gauging of running water, and > almost all hydraulic operations. The passage of a star over the cross-hairs > of a telescope, when the astronomer has only one free hand, will be very > precisely indicated by this new means, which will either serve to verify the > count of the seconds on a clock, or will replace such a count if the distant > location of the clock or poor hearing keeps the escapement from being heard. > […] We think that Mr. Rieussec’s Chronograph deserves the Academy’s > approval.Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA1625 In summary, on October 14, 1821, Rieussec presented his invention to the Academy of Sciences, which christened it a chronograph. The term was particularly well chosen: chronograph comes from the Greek words and , which means “that which writes time”. This system works as follows: a nib places a black mark on the dial at the moment when the phenomenon being measured ends. So the user can read the duration of the phenomenon - a horse race or something else - on the dial thanks to the time written by the hand. The chronograph was born! = Obtaining a Patent = Armed with the reports from the Race Jury and the Academy of Sciences, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec sent a letter to “His Excellency, Comte Siméon, Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior.” Ambitious, he reminded the minister that the minister had given him cause to hope for “a Patent on the basis of public utility.” To support his request, he attached a copy of the previously mentioned reports and “the plans and designs for the component parts of the race Chronograph and of the one used for astronomy and for observation of phenomena requiring the strictest accuracy.” This last point is important. It tells that right from the beginning, Rieussec made two different chronographs - one tested at the 1821 Arrondissement de la Seine race, the other presented before the Academy of Sciences that same year. Rieussec's application, recorded by the Ministry of the Interior's departments, was examined by the Advisory Committee for Arts and Factories at a meeting on December 22, 1821. At its meeting on March 2, 1822, the Advisory Committee acknowledged the following facts: “Sieur Rieussec, Watchmaker to the King in Paris, requests a five-year patent for a timepiece that he calls a Chronograph. The description and design furnished by the petitioner were sufficiently clear and detailed; nothing stands in the way of granting the Patent.” One week later, on March 9, 1822, Rieussec obtained a five-year patent for a “Timepiece, or timer for distance covered, called a chronograph with seconds indicator, indicating the duration of several successive phenomena without requiring the observer’s attention.” In his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. The following text is an excerpt from his justification: > “The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too > large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated > parts that made up the mechanism. “Since that time I have attempted to > simplify the mechanism enough so that chronographs could be incorporated > into very small watches, and as will be seen in the description < >, I have > even combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single > case, such that this instrument is always available to use. The > simplifications that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism > even to the most ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very > moderate price.”Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA5889 He was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand. = Improvements to Chronographs = Still, it was not until the fall of 1837 that Rieussec filed a patent application for \\"Improvements to Chronographs\\". The wording of this application sounds like a manifesto: Ten-year patent for invention and various significant improvements made to chronographs, which he states he invented and improved. In his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. Here is an excerpt from his justification: > ”The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too > large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated > parts that made up the mechanism. Since that time I have attempted to > simplify the mechanism enough so that Cronographs could be incorporated into > very small watches, and as will be seen in the description […], I have even > combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single case, > such that this instrument is always available to use. The simplifications > that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism even to the most > ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very moderate price.” He was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand. Improvements to Chronographs invented by Nicolas Rieussec - 1822  Inventor  = Other patents: From the Cart with Measuring Device to the Rieussec Snuffbox = On the eve of 1830, Nicolas Mathieu's brother Nicolas Joseph Rieussec was interested in selling heating wood. It was in this context of a new business being developed by his brother that our watchmaker filed two new patents, both completely unrelated to watchmaking. On September 5, 1832, he drew up an application for “a cart for transporting heating wood to a residence [and called a] cart with measuring device [voiture porte mesure] or improved dray.” An excerpt from one of the documents submitted with the file helps to imagine Rieussec's project: Improvements to Chronographs invented by Nicolas Rieussec - 1845 > “This cart differs from those known as measuring carts [voitures mesures] > mainly in that in these last, the frame that contains the wood to be > transported, which is longer and more cumbersome, is placed above the axle > and is part of the body of the cart, which necessitates the use of wheels > with a small diameter to avoid having it be too high, but then one can see > how difficult it is for the horse that has to pull the full cart, especially > if it meets with an obstacle. In contrast, the frame of the cart with > measuring device is suspended beneath the axle, which allows for the use of > large wheels […].”Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA3981 He was granted a five-year patent on October 5, 1832. Some months later, Rieussec drew up a new application, again for an invention related to heating wood. This time, he claimed “a new and improved system of devices for sawing, weighing and measuring residential heating wood.” Rieussec's interest in heating wood is astonishing, for being so much a part of another time. Yet he did express real concern for some of his contemporaries’ daily concerns. Rieussec's career as an inventor did not stop there. In 1860, at the age of 79, he filed another patent application, his last. This time, it was for a “snuffbox system called the Rieussec Snuffbox.” Rieussec's last invention showed a concern for health that was before its time.  A veteran of French watchmaking  = An Award-Winning World’s Fair Exhibitor from 1823-1855 = During the first half of the 19th century, the French industrial sector was expanding rapidly. Its newness led public authorities to work toward encouraging a “copycat effect.” Consequently, industry lived by the rhythm of the expositions devoted to its products. From 1823 to 1855, Rieussec was a regular participant in these exhibitions, which initially were held every four years. The first world's fair was held in 1851, in London. Rieussec was there. In 1855, Paris hosted another world's fair, which gave the Second Empire an opportunity to celebrate industry and modernity. These expositions were an opportunity for Rieussec to collect new honours. In 1823, he exhibited an “astronomical clock with seconds, and a watch of his own invention, which he calls a chronograph.” This earned him a bronze medal. He was also among the exhibitors in 1839, when he introduced a new-style chronograph, after having obtained a patent the year before. The jury awarded him the bronze medal, a repeat of the one received in 1823. Rieussec was again present at the 1844 exposition. That year, “the jury [was] delighted to acknowledge how prolific Mr. Rieussec’s invention has been in terms of useful applications, and hasten[ed] to do him justice by awarding him a silver medal.” In 1851, he was in London exhibiting in the Crystal Palace. Once again, his products, attracted notice. “The ingenuity of the mechanical combinations used by Mr. Rieussec to conveniently and reliably obtain a result so valuable to experimenters so impressed the London jury that the creator of this mechanism was unanimously found worthy of the first prize, and - to the great regret of all the judges - was deprived of it only by the clause in the rules stipulating that the highest award could not be given to an invention more than twenty years old.” Which, however, did not prevent him from being awarded a prize medal. The 1855 world's fair was the crowning achievement of Rieussec's watchmaking career, as “this veteran of French watchmaking” was awarded a first-class medal.  Supplier to the Royal Furniture Depository  Rieussec's work was not limited to sophisticated measuring instruments such as the chronograph, intended to make official measurements of time intervals, whether for horse races or scientific phenomena. His activity as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository gave him an opportunity to create movements for the clocks ordered to decorate certain rooms of the royal residences. In 1821, Rieussec delivered a clock called “Iris fastening on her wings” intended for the bedchamber of the Duke of Bordeaux, who was the grandson of the Count of Artois, brother of King Louis XVIII. Between 1820 and 1825, Rieussec signed a movement for a clock depicting Saint Vincent de Paul. This object was brought to Saint-Cloud castle in early 1826. In 1821, more active than ever, Rieussec delivered a superb clock representing “Sappho inspired by Love,” followed by a “Homer singing over the ruins of Troy”clock which he delivered to the Royal Furniture Depository that same year. During the last years of the Restoration (1815–1830) or the first years of the July Monarchy (1830–1848), Rieussec signed a movement for a clock representing the shepherd Belisarius, inspired by a painting shown by the painter Gérard at the Salon of 1795. These few examples are an accurate reflection of Nicolas Rieussec's great productivity between 1820 and the end of the Restoration. Having been Watchmaker to Louis XVIII (1815–1824), then to his brother Charles X (1824–1830), Rieussec remained a Watchmaker to the King under the following regime. Louis-Philippe, who was king from 1830 to 1848, appreciated Rieussec's work enough to keep him in his service. It was also during this time that Rieussec became associated with another watchmaker, Chaudé.  Was watchmaking passed down from father to son?  The genealogies that were able to consult for this article repeatedly note that Joseph Ferdinand, the son of Nicolas Mathieu, born December 15, 1804, was a Watchmaker to the King. To date, there has not been found any document confirming this. It remains to be seen whether Joseph Ferdinand followed in his father's footsteps and became a watchmaker. One passage in the property inventory made after Nicolas Mathieu's death implies that the father left his business to his son. Here, again, there is no evidence attesting to the son's watchmaking activity. Everything there is to know about this is that when his father died, Joseph Ferdinand was a merchant and lived at no. 183, Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain, now Rue de Grenelle.  Last years  Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec died at his home at 60 Avenue du Bel-Air in Paris, in 1866. The declaration of succession drawn up after his death noted that he was a gentleman of independent means at the time. His heirs were his son Joseph Ferdinand and the daughters of his own daughter, Marie Clotilde, who had died young in 1842. The inventory of Nicolas Mathieu's property, drawn up after his death, noted that the deceased was a Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honour. Unfortunately, there has been no trace of his file in the National Archives where the Legion of Honour's records are kept.

He founded and directed choirs and the vocal ensemble Collegium Cantorum and is notable for the composition of choral music. He was a conductor of major theaters of Lower Saxony and a professor of the Musikhochschule Hannover as well as a composer. Biography Siegfried Strohbach began having piano lessons at the age of five. From 1939 to 1945, he was a student of the Musisches Gymnasium (high school with music as a main course) in Frankfurt with a major in piano. He studied composition with its founder and director Kurt Thomas. From 1946 to 1949 he continued his studies in composition and conducting with Thomas privately, and studied the piano with August Leopolder. From 1947 to 1949 he worked as a Korrepetitor (coach) at the Oper Frankfurt. In 1949 he moved to Hanover, where he studied singing with Paul Gümmer at the Landesmusikschule. As a choral conductor, he took under his wing several amateur choirs in and around Hanover. During this time he wrote his first successful compositions, including the premiere of his chamber opera Die Wette, and made initial contact with the publisher Breitkopf & Härtel. From 1951 to 1953 he was Kapellmeister for plays at the Landestheater (now Staatstheater Hannover). In 1953 he founded the choir \\"Propsteichor Hannover\\" and also the \\"Collegium Cantorum\\", a semiprofessional ensemble which became known through concerts and broadcasts. He was to direct the group until 1982. From 1953 to 1966 Strohbach was a music teacher at the gymnasium St. Ursula in Hanover, but continued to work as a freelancer at the theater Landesbühne, which covers performances all over Lower Saxony, from 1951 to 1993. During that time he wrote incidental music for the stage, some 40 pieces. From 1966 he was lecturer in music theory at the Musikhochschule Hannover, where he was appointed professor in 1973, teaching until his retirement in 1994. Parallel to teaching, Strohbach was from 1967 to 1984 Kapellmeister of the Landesbühne and conducted opera and concert at the festival \\"Musik und Theater in Herrenhausen\\" in the Baroque Herrenhausen Gardens, including works of Monteverdi, Mozart, and particularly Handel. Works and awards Strohbach composed numerous sacred and secular choral works for a variety of ensembles, also chamber music, works for piano, songs, stage music, even Spanish folk music, among others. His works were published by Breitkopf and Härtel, Wiesbaden, Edition Ferrimontana, Frankfurt, Möseler Verlag, Wolfenbüttel, and Strube-Verlag, Munich. In 1994 he was awarded the Niedersächsischer Kunstpreis (Art Prize of Lower Saxony). =Selected works= * Denn der Herr ist nahe, symphonic cantata for soprano, baritone, mixed choir and large orchestra * Missa beatae Virginis, (Mass of the Blessed Virgin) for soprano solo, female choir and organ * Johannes-Passion (Passion after John) for solo voice and mixed choir a cappella, Möseler 2001 * 6 Evangelien- Motetten (6 Gospel motets) for mixed choir a cappella * Großer Kalender (Great calendar) on texts by Fritz Graßhoff for male choir, piano and large orchestra * Eichendorff-Serenade after Joseph von Eichendorff for mixed choir and three instruments * Viva la musica, cantata for baritone solo, six-part mixed choir, strings and percussion, Möseler 1984 * Max & Moritz, cantata on Wilhelm Busch's Max and Moritz for mixed choir and piano * 5 Trinklieder (5 drinking songs) after old texts, for baritone solo, male choir and piano * 5 Galgenlieder after Christian Morgenstern for four-part male chorus a cappella * Tanz rüber - tanz nüber, Eine Rundreise mit europäischen Tanzliedern (A round trip with European dancing songs) for female choir, piano and percussion * Der Stern aus Jakob (The star from Jacob), cantata for Epiphany, from the cantata cycle Auf dem Weg (In the way), for baritone solo, mixed choir, oboe and organ, Strube 2005 =Performances and recordings= Marktkirche Hannover, 2007 Strohbach's music has been performed by notable ensembles.

It is characterized: \\"For example, Strohbach is the only one to explicitly integrate an “aria” into his composition. His cantata for Epiphany features a large- scale baritone solo as its third movement which is accompanied by the oboe in imitation. While, in this instance, Strohbach deliberately adheres to traditional forms of composition, the narrative sections of his work are dealt with freely: He renders them through recitation as well as through a finely coloured, grand a cappella motet.\\" In 2010 the Mädchenchor am Kölner Dom (girls' choir at the Cologne Cathedral) celebrated their 21st anniversary with a service Kapitelsamt in the cathedral, singing his Missa Beatae Mariae Virginis.

Having abandoned his family in England, Egerton returned to Mexico in 1841 with Alice Edwards, the teenaged daughter of another British painter. He and the eight-month pregnant Alice were murdered in the village of Tacubaya (present day Mexico City), Mexico, where they had rented a house, on 27 April 1842. Egerton was carrying large amounts of money, and both he and Alice were wearing jewelry which was untouched, although the murder was attributed to a robbery. British diplomatic pressure to solve the crime led to the arrest of three local petty thieves, two of whom were hanged, and one of whom was allowed to escape from prison. There has been speculation that Egerton's alleged involvement in fraudulent land sales in Texas, his ties to a Masonic order, or an unknown jealous lover of Alice was behind the killing.

As a child, Staszko was an athlete, becoming long jump champion of his Třinec Polish primary school. He started playing mariáš and betting on sport games during high school. Later, while studying at Technical University of Ostrava, he not only supported himself from the games, but he also saved roughly CZK400,000 (€14,000) annually. During his studies, Staszko became champion of the Czech university darts league and was also a successful chess player. After finishing studies, Staszko started working at Třinec Iron and Steel Works. He began playing poker in 2007, initially playing online in games which did not require entrance fee, but provided some very limited returns. At that time, Staszko worked as foreman at Hyundai Nošovice automobile manufacturing plant's paint shop. He was in charge of around 200 workers, earning a little over CZK 30,000 (€1,200) a month. He used to get up at five in the morning in order to attend twelve hours shifts followed by playing poker, leaving only some four to five hours for sleep. He was able to win an equivalent of six-months salary during a night online session.

It is shared by three grama panchayaths: Thachanattukara, Aliparamba] and Thazhekode. The name Poovathani is derived from two Malayalam words \\"poovam\\" (local name of a tree) and \\"Athani\\" (meaning shelter). History The old mosque built with laterite, wood and tiles at Poovathani was renovated to a two storeyed concrete building in the late seventies with the major finaciers being the NRIs from the region. Poovathani is always remembered for its market or Poovathani chantha. It was started by Pothiyil Thottiparambil Sayed Haji(Grad father of P T Syed sahib). It was once chief commercial centre for merchants from thazhekode,aliparamba,thachanattukara. Location Poovathani is a small village located about one kilometre away from Karinkallathani, an ever expanding town between Mannarkkad and Perinthalmanna on NH 213.Poovathani is located between Karinkallathani and Thootha on the thootha vettaththoor road Economy Poovathani lost its lustre as a weekly market where small traders from in and around this village used to gather on Mondays with the starting of bus services to nearby interior places like Alipparamba, Kampuram and Chethalloor. Otherwise people from these places had to depend on Poovathani for household items and other essential goods from an array of small and medium shops located on both sides of the main road at Povathani. Facilities The village was self-sufficient in the sense that it had all that was required for a village community, viz, provisional stores, tea shops, hotels, textile shops, tailor shops, Vaidyans, small lodges, library, an upper primary school, ration shop, slaughter houses and mosque, etc. Weekly Markets The weekly market which existed for a long time would make the whole area a lively one from Sunday evening till Tuesday evening every week. There used to be a lot of hustle and bustle on Mondays when one could see large gatherings of people in the market. It was a place for selling vegetables for those who cultivated their own in farmyards got vacant after harvest of paddy. It was a place for buying cheap dry fish which was the only affordable non vegetarian item for most of the population those days. The children of the place eagerly awaited Mondays to come as they used to get coins from some of the visiting traders in the market and some rich people of the place as well. Demographics Most of the people lived in poverty. Most of them had to depend on their livelihood by working for the handful of lucky people who owned large chunks of farmland and coconut plantations. The situation changed for the good after the gulf boom. Many people from the area tried their fortune in the gulf countries even risking their lives and property for their journeys. Most of them succeeded in getting rich in time. Transportation The nearby Karinkallathani came into prominence with the transportation facility improving and Poovathani was reduced to a place of unimportance. The weekly market slowly vanished. The property where the thriving weekly market existed once was sold for partition among its heirs and concrete houses were built in its place.  Places of worship  Poovathani Juma Masjid is a chief place of worship for Muslims. There is an ancient temple nearby, known as Panamkurussi Bagavathi Temple. In the annual week-long festival of this temple popularly known as \\"Panamkurussi Kavu Pooram\\" people from all religious sects actively participate.Ancient Hindu art forms like Cherumakkali, Thullal,Chakyar koothu etc. were played at the poorapparambu.The Pooram festival is the only festival which gives an exposure for such art forms to members of other communities of the region.  Educational institutions  Poovathani has played a pivotal role in the socio educational development of the region with the presence of well-educated community in all respective fields. There is an Upper Primary School, namely, A.M.U.P. School established in 1938.http://www.education.kerala.gov.in/Downloads2011/Notifications/statitics/up/malappuramup.pdf This school is one of the biggest schools in Perintalmanna \\"Educational Sub District\\".There are three religious schools (Madrasas) also to provide religious education to children. There is a Balavadi also. Apart from the school and Balavadi there are no major government or government aided establishments in Poovathani.

It is closely related to Block Truncation Coding, another lossy image compression algorithm, which predates Color Cell Compression, in that it uses the dominant luminance of a block of pixels to partition said pixels into two representative colors. The primary difference between Color Cell Compression and Block Truncation Coding is that the former was designed to compress color images and the latter was designed to compress grayscale images. Also, Block Truncation Coding requires that the standard deviation of the colors of pixels in a block be computed in order to compress an image, whereas Color Cell Compression does not use the standard deviation. Both algorithms, though, can compress an image down to effectively 2 bits per pixel. Original uncompressed 24-bits per pixel color image CCC compressed image, but using only 24-bits to 15-bits color quantization combined with a luminance bitmap for 2.875 bits per pixel (with no palette / lookup-table) 256 entry palette / lookup-table implementation of the CCC algorithm at 2-bits per pixel with the palette built using K-means clustering Result of the output of Mandrill standard test image compressed with the CCC algorithm at 2-bits per pixel with a 256 entry palette / lookup-table generated using a naïve 15-bit color histogram algorithm  Algorithm  = Compression = The Color Cell Compression algorithm processes an image in eight steps, although one of the steps (step #6) is optional. It is assumed here that the input is a 24 bits/pixel image, as assumed in the original journal article, although other bit depths could be used. ::# For each 8-bit RGB octet triple contained in each 24-bit color value in the input image, the NTSC luminance y is computed using the following formula: y = 0.30 \\\\times red + 0.59 \\\\times green + 0.11 \\\\times blue ::# The image is now subdivided into 4-pixel by 4-pixel blocks, and, the arithmetic mean of the luminance of each pixel in the block is used to select a representative luminance value. ::# Each block of pixels is then divided into two groups. One group consists of pixels in the current block where each pixel's luminance is greater than or equal to the representative luminance for the current block. The second group of pixels consists of pixels in the current block where each pixel's luminance is less than the representative luminance for the current block. Whether a pixel in the current block belongs to a certain group is determined by a binary \\"0\\" or a \\"1\\" value in another, separate, 16-entry bitmap. ::# Two representative 24-bit colors are now selected for each block of pixels by computing two arithmetic means. The first arithmetic mean is the arithmetic mean of all of the pixels belonging to the first group of pixels where the luminance of each pixel is a \\"1\\" in the luminance bitmap. The second 24-bit representative color is selected similarly, by taking the arithmetic mean of all the 24-bit color pixels in the second group where each pixel corresponds to a \\"0\\" in the luminance bitmap. ::# The luminance bitmap is stored in a temporary location and then the two 24-bit representative colors for the current block are appended to the bitmap. At this stage, the image has been compressed into a 16-entry bitmap with two 24-bit binary values appended. The total size of the compressed block is now 16 bits for the luminance bitmap, and two 24-bit binary quantities for each representative color, yielding a total size of 64 bits, which, when divided by 16 (the number of pixels in the block), yields 4 i.e. 4 bits per pixel. ::# Each compressed block of pixels is modified by truncating each of the two 24-bit representative colors to 15 bits. This step is optional, and the algorithm can terminate at this point, if desired, as the compressed blocks at this stage have a total size of 16 + 2 \\\\times 15 = 46 bits, which, when divided by 16, yields 2.875 bits per pixel. If this step is performed, then the 15-bit truncated color values can be used in the next step to create a smaller histogram. Also, since each 15-bit binary color vector is presumably stored in a 16-bit word, then the 16th bit can be used to improve the image quality by specifying which one of two lookup tables should be used. ::# A histogram of all the 24-bit colors in the original 24-bit color image, or the truncated 15-bit color vectors, is created. In a naïve implementation, the histogram is consulted to choose 256 of the most frequently used colors which are then put into a 256-entry array, where each entry consists of three octets of a 24-bit per pixel color value. The histogram method of selecting the most appropriate colors for the original 24-bit per pixel color image can instead be replaced by the median cut algorithm which usually yields better results. ::# The final step consists of taking the current block of pixels and determining which 24-bit per pixel color in the 256-entry lookup table most closely match the two representative colors for each block. The two 8-bit indices pointing to colors in the lookup table are now appended to the 16-bit luminance bitmap. This yields a total compressed size of 16 + 8 + 8 = 32 bits, which, when divided by 16, yields 2 bits per pixel. = Decompression = Decompression is very easy and straightforward. To reconstruct each compressed 4-pixel by 4-pixel block, the 16-bit luminance bitmap is consulted for each block. Depending on whether an element of the bitmap is 1 or 0, one of the two 8-bit indices into the lookup table is selected and then dereferenced and the corresponding 24-bit per pixel color value is retrieved.  Performance and image quality  In spite of its very simple mechanism, the algorithm yields surprisingly good results on photographic images, and it has the advantage of being very fast to decode with limited hardware. Although far surpassed in compression ratio by later block-transform coding methods such as JPEG, it has the advantage of very simple decompression and fast random access into the compressed image.

They took place from December 23 until December 29, 1916 according to the calendar used in Russia at the time (or January 5 to January 11, 1917 according to the Gregorian Calendar then in use in the West and now in use almost everywhere), The Army was commanded by Gen. Radko Dimitriev; it was opposed by the 8th German Army. The battles took place in a swampy region, Tīreļpurvs (Tīrelis Swamp), between Lake Babīte and Jelgava. The main assault force was the VI Siberian Rifle Corps which included two Latvian Riflemen brigades (\\"strēlnieki\\" who became a part of Latvian folklore and an important factor in the Latvian national awakening movement). Background The German 8th army's advance was stopped near Riga in October 1915. Almost immediately German forces started to fortify their positions. A huge, 30 km. long wall (the so-called:German Wall) built out of sand and wood was constructed across Tīreļpurvs, separating both armies for more than a year. German fortification German Wall across the Tīrelis Swamp. Also a railway line was constructed for the delivery of ammunition. The Russian 12th Army was divided into three groups before it attacked. The main task force was Babīte group which consisted of 48 battalions and 208 cannon. On the opposite side were 19 German battalions from the 6th Landwehr-Brigade. The core of the Babīte group was the VI Siberian corps. which included both Latvian Rifleman brigades. The battle After the failure of the 1916 campaigns in Romania the Commander of the Russian Empire's 12th Army received an order to attack on the Riga front. Its objective was to attract the German reserve forces, thus helping their allies to resist on the Verdun battlefield. In mid-December 1916 there was a deep fall in temperature with a heavy frost, making it possible to move through the now frozen bog and gain access to the German fortifications. It was quickly decided to launch an attack at Christmas. The main objective being to the capture of Jelgava (Mitau). Latvian Rifleman in the trenches during Christmas Battles The attack began early in the morning of the 23 December (5 January) and surprised the Germans, who thought that the Russian troops would be celebrating Christmas. Latvian Riflemen were the advance guard in the attack, their main task being to capture the first German lines and clear the way for the main force following behind them. Wearing white winter camouflage uniforms and using the cover of a heavy snowstorm the Latvians cut passages through the German barbed wire barriers. After this was done, the main forces of the two Latvian Riflemen brigades advanced through the breached wire using the element of surprise without any artillery support to prevent giving the German garrison forces an advanced warning of the ongoing operation. After successfully crossing the German Wall they captured the first German battle line after a brief skirmish. Many of the soldiers could not make it to the wall and did not have a way to retreat without the Germans spotting them, thus these units chose to die from frostbite (whilst not moving) over betraying their fellow Latvian brothers. The battle continued over the next two days with varying success, as all the Latvian units became involved in heavy fighting within the breached position and the German defence stiffened as it received reinforcements from Jelgava. In further fighting the German second defensive line at Mangaļi homestead fell to the assaulting forces. At this point the attack was stopped as the Russian Commander-in-Chief had no reinforcements on hand to put into the action apart from 17th Siberian Regiment, which refused to go to battle, this mutiny was supported by several other units from the II and VI Siberian Army Corps, and an augury of things to come in the Russian Revolution. Whilst the mutiny by the Siberian units on the field caused a halt in the Russian battle-plan, the Germans were receiving substantial troop reinforcement from Jelgava, and quickly launched a counter- attack upon the Russian and Latvian positions in their breached defences. Fighting in a mid-winter temperature of -35 °C, the Latvian Riflemen units held back the German attacks for 48 hours. On 25 December (7 January) Russian troops launched an attack on heavily fortified sand dunes on the northern side of Tīreļpurvs. A central part of those fortifications was a fortified hill, which later was named Ložmetējkalns (\\"Machine-gun Hill\\"). On Christmas morning the 3rd and 7th the Latvian Rifleman Regiments, together with the 53rd Siberian Regiment, after suffering heavy losses, partially surrounded the German forces. The 2nd Latvian Rifleman Brigade attacked the position from the rear and thus finally broke the German resistance on Machine-gun Hill. Many German soldiers managed to retreat, around 1000 being taken prisoners. It was the biggest victory by the Russian forces on the Riga Front and the German Army lost one of its strongest fortifications. Overall, a more than 7 km. wide gap was made in the German lines. However, the Commander of the 12th Russian Army was not in a position to exploit the opportunity and organize a pursuit because he had not anticipated the Latvian Rifle Brigade's victory. January battles-German counterattack After their partial defeat in the Christmas battles, the German 8th Army organized a counterattack to conquer back their lost positions. The Germans received strong reinforcements and many fresh divisions were stationed in Jelgava. In the early morning of 23 January a massive artillery barrage started, which was soon followed by an infantry attack along the whole battle line. The main German forces consisted of the 1st. Reserve division (1. Reserve-Division) and 2nd Infantry Division (2. Infanterie-Division). They attacked across Tīrelis Swamp against the Latvian and Russian positions. Latvian riflemen and the Siberians desperately defended their positions for three days. The Russians tried to launch three counterattacks, but all of them failed. In one of those counterattacks Latvian riflemen were forced to attack across an open field against German machine guns and thus suffered heavy losses (especially the 3rd Kurzeme Regiment). The temperature dropped to -38 °C making it impossible for either side to continue active warfare. The Germans managed to regain 80% of their lost positions, although 'Machine-gun Hill' stayed in Russian hands. Aftermath The Christmas Battles gave the Latvian Riflemen a reputation of capable warriors, but they also suffered huge losses as the Latvian Riflemen lost more than a third of their original fighting force (the Latvians lost about 9000 soldiers). Christmas Eve's battle slogan of liberation of Jelgava and all of Courland was proved to be just a slogan without serious coverage. The heavy casualties resulted in strong resentment against the Russian generals and the Tsar among the riflemen. This resentment later proved to be a decisive factor for the increased support among the Latvian troops for the Bolsheviks, who were advocating for a cease-fire and an end to the war. However the 12th Army Command severely punished Siberian Riflemen, some of whom refused to go into battle - 92 of them were transferred to the war tribunal and condemned to death, and several hundred were sent back to Siberia. Reconstructed fragment of the German Wall and bunker in the Museum of the Christmas Battles. (2009) Today Tīrelis Swamp and the nearby forests are part of the Museum of the Christmas Battles which in its turn is branch of Latvian War Museum. The museum was created to honour Latvian riflemen and other soldiers who fought in the Riga Front during the First World War. Many of the old trenches are still visible in this area today, complemented by reconstructed fortifications and bunkers. References *Information of the Christmas Battles (in German). *Илья Максимов.

The governorate was located in the North of European Russia, and its territory is currently divided between Vologda, Novgorod, and Leningrad Oblasts. History The governorate was established on June 26, 1918 by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

In 1924, the reform of the low-level administrative division in the governorate was performed. Some of the volosts were abolished in favor of selsoviets. On August 1, 1927 Cherepovets Governorate was abolished, and its area was transformed into Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Eventually, most of the area of the okrug (with the exception of lands around Tikhvin) were in 1937 included into newly established Vologda Oblast.

Geography  Saw Kill tributary is located in Ulster County. 19.7 miles (31.7 km) long, it rises in Forest Preserve lands on the lower slopes of Indian Head Mountain and, after flowing through the town of Woodstock, empties into the Esopus just above Saugerties; just north of Route 209 and just downstream of Ulster Town Hall. The Saw Kill is one of the major tributaries to the Esopus. There is a sedimentary delta halfway across the Esopus Creek channel in this area, which indicates high sediment loads in the Saw Kill. Saw Kill drains are mostly forested watershed. The watershed also contains some wetland areas.  History  On January 1, 1765, William Legg bought around 100 acres of land lying on both sides of the Saw Kill for 50 schipples of wheat. This was one of the first purchases to be made in the present town of Kingston. Legg built a sawmill and a house. The contract also required him to pay half a bushel of wheat every year to the trustees who he bought the land from. The Legg family lived there for 88 years. It was reported that they ground wheat in the mill for the Continental Army. The next owner was James Gaddis. He continued the milling operations and denied requests of people to use the land for quarrying. However, in the 1880s a fire destroyed both the house and the mill. Gaddis, needing money to rebuild, gave permission for quarrying bluestone on the Saw Mill creek ledge. The extensive quarrying moved the falls that were located by the mill back 300 feet. Howe’s Mill was another mill located on the Saw Kill. It powered by a dam at Little Falls. The mill was used to make gunpowder and there were frequently explosions. The mill stayed mostly intact, however, and continued operating until the 1860s when it was hit by lightning. Bluestone quarrying in the area increased in 1828 when the Delaware and Hudson Canals were being built. Quarry owners hired unskilled immigrant laborers and built houses for them in the area. This led to the creation of small, distinct, immigrant communities. Many of the houses built during this time are still standing. In the 1900s railroads helped spur tourism in the region. During the summers, many farmers would take in boarders from the city. The scenic beauty and good trout fishing in the Saw Kill and other similar creeks is part of what attracted people to the area. With the growth of suburban life in America, suburban communities developed in Sweat Meadows along the Saw Kill creek. Flooding in the creek then became an issue for these communities. Residents organized a clean-out of the creek in 1981. However, this didn’t solve the problem and flooding continues to happen during heavy rains.  Ecosystems  The Saw Kill provides an important habitat for various species. Opposite the place where the Saw Kill joins the Esopus are alluvial flats with flood-plain pools, which used to be sand or gravel pits. They now provide an important habitat for frogs, including the Northern Leopard Frog (which is rare in the region). Other organisms such as dragonflies and small fish provide the basis for a thriving ecosystem in the area.  Water quality  There have been some water quality issues in the Saw Kill (west). High bacteria counts have been found in tests taken near Lake Katrine. The bacteria levels are worse during times of heavy rainfall.  Recreation  The Saw Kill contains whitewater rapids for rafting and kayaking, in addition to swimming holes. The Saw Kill also attracts fishers.

Depending upon the type of microscanner the modulatory movement of a single mirror can be either translatory or rotational, on one or two axes. In the first case, a phase shifting effect takes place. In the second case, the incident light wave is deflected. Resonant translational mirror in pantograph design with a deflection of ±500 μm Therefore, they have to be differentiated from spatial light modulators, other micromirror actuators which need a matrix of individually addressable mirrors for their mode of operation. If a single array mirror already fulfils the desired modulation but is operated in parallel with other array mirrors in order to increase the light yield, then the term microscanner array is used. Characteristics Common chip dimensions are 4 mm × 5 mm for mirror diameters between 1 and 3 mm.VarioS Mikroscanner Construction Kit. Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems IPMS (Product Description). However larger mirror apertures with side measurements of up to approx. 10 mm × 3 mm can also be produced. The scan frequencies depend upon the design and mirror size and range between 0.1 and 50 kHz. The deflection movement is either resonant or quasi-static. With microscanners that are capable of tilting movement, light can be directed over a projection plane. Many applications requires that a surface is addressed instead of only a single line. For double resonant operation, which results in sinusoidal scan motion, a Lissajous pattern is written. Mechanical deflection angles of such micro scanning devices reach up to ±30°. With translational (piston type) microscanners a mechanical stroke of up to approx. ±500 μm can be attained. This configuration is energy efficient, but requires complicated control electronics. For high end display applications the common choice is raster scanning, where a resonant scanner (for the longer display dimension) is paired with quasi-static scanner (for the shorter dimension). Drive principles The required drive forces for the mirror movement can be provided by various physical principles. In practice, the relevant principles for driving such a mirror are the electromagnetic, electrostatic, thermo-electric and piezo-electric effects. Because the physical principles differ in their advantages and disadvantages, a suitable driving principle should be chosen according to the application. Specifically, the mechanical solutions required for resonant and quasi-static scanning, respectively, are very different from each other. Thermo-electric actuators are not applicable for high frequency resonant scanners, but the other three principles can be applied to the full spectrum of applications. For resonant scanners one often employed configuration is the indirect drive. In an indirect drive a small motion in a larger mass is coupled to a large motion in a smaller mass (the mirror) through mechanical amplification at a favorable mode shape. This is in contrast to the more common direct drive, where the actuator mechanism moves the mirror directly. Indirect drives have been implemented for electromagnetic, electrostatic, as well as piezo-electric actuators. There is no general answer to the question if the direct or indirect drive is more efficient, but judging by the performance of existing scanners the indirect drive appears to have the largest impact for piezoelectric scanners. Electrostatic actuators offer high power similar to electromagnetic drives. In contrast to an electromagnetic drive, the resulting drive force between the drive structures cannot be reversed in polarity. For the realization of quasi- static components with positive and negative effective direction, two drives with positive and negative polarity are required. As a rule of thumb, vertical comb drives are utilized here. Nevertheless, the highly non-linear drive characteristics in some parts of the deflection area can be hindering for controlling the mirror properly. For that reason many highly developed microscanners today utilize a resonant mode of operation, where an Eigenmode is activated. Resonant operation is most energy efficient. For beam positioning and applications which are to be static-actuated or linearized- scanned, quasi-static drives are required and therefore of great interest. Magnetic actuators offer very good linearity of the tilt angle versus the applied signal amplitude, both in static and dynamic operation. The working principle is that a metallic coil is placed on the moving MEMS mirror itself and as the mirror is placed in a magnetic field, the alternative current flowing in the coil generate Lorentz force that tilts the mirror. Magnetic actuation can either be used for actuating 1D or 2D MEMS mirrors. Another characteristics of the magnetically actuated MEMS mirror is the fact the low voltage is required (below 5V) making this actuation compatible with standard CMOS voltage. An advantage of such actuation type is that MEMS behavior does not present hysteresis, as opposed to electrostatic actuated MEMS mirrors, that make it very simple to control. Power consumption of magnetically actuated MEMS mirror can be as low as 0.04 mW. Thermoelectric drives produce high driving forces, but they present a few technical drawbacks inherent to their fundamental principle. The actuator has to be thermally well insulated from the environment, as well as being pre-heated in order to prevent thermal drift due to environmental influences. That is why the necessary heat output and power consumption for a thermal bimorph actuator is relatively high. One further disadvantage is the comparably low displacement which needs to be leveraged to reach usable mechanical deflections. Also thermal actuators are not suitable for high frequency operation due to significant low pass behaviour. Piezo-electrical drives produce high force, but as with electro- thermal actuators the stroke length is short. Piezo-electrical drives are, however, less susceptible to thermal environmental influences and can also transmit high-frequency drive signals well. To achieve the desired angle some mechanism utilizing mechanical amplification will be required for most applications. This has proven to be difficult for quasi-static scanners, although there are promising approaches in the literature using long meandering flexures for deflection amplification. For resonant rotational scanners, on the other hand, scanners using piezo-electric actuation combined with an indirect drive are the highest performer in terms of scan angle and working frequency. However, the technology is newer than electro-static and electro-magnetic drives and remains to be implemented in commercial products. Fields of Application {  LDC module with 1D microscanner and integrated optical position sensor on the back side  An electrostatic 2D microscanner in a DIL20 casing  MEMS scanner module for 3D distance measurement (LIDAR) with a single sending mirror (mirror dimensions approx. (9.5 × 2.5 mm)) and a synchronized microscanner array (2 × 7) as receiver unit. } Applications for tilting microscanners are numerous and include: * Projection displays * Image recording, e.g. for technical and medical endoscopes * Bar code scanning * Spectroscopy * Laser marking and material processing * Object measurement / triangulation * 3D cameras * Object recognition * 1D and 2D light grid * Confocal microscopy / OCT * Fluorescence microscopy * Laser wavelength modulation Some of the applications for piston type microscanners are: * Fourier transform infrared spectrometer * Confocal microscopy * Focus variation Manufacture {  Wafer with resonant microscanners, ready- processed with the Fraunhofer AME75 process (based on blank BSOI wafers), before dicing the devices.  Detail of a wafer with VarioS microscanners, developed and produced based on a modular fabrication system at Fraunhofer IPMS. } Microscanners are usually manufactured with surface or bulk micromechanic processes. As a rule, silicon or BSOI (bonded silicon on insulator) are used. Advantages and disadvantages of microscanners The advantages of microscanners compared to macroscopic light modulators such as galvanometer scanners are based upon their small size, low weight and minimum power consumption. Further advantages arise along with the integration possibilities of position sensor technology and electronics in the component. Microscanners are also extremely resistant to environmental influences. For example, the microscanners developed at one of the globally renowned manufacturing organizations have a shock resistance of at least 2500 g. Under the condition that they are sealed free from dust and humidity, they are by and large, maintenance-free and usually operate at temperatures between -20 °C and +80 °C. Some of the disadvantages due to the manufacturing process are high costs for single devices and long delivery times. In order to address these problems, various scientists at the named manufacturing organization have attempted to provide a platform technology, which is an advanced MEMS modular system. The system deals with the reduction of this problem, allowing the problem to act with minimal influence; thus raising the admirability of the system technology.

Biography Fisher came from a family of farmers from Hethersett, near Norwich, who had been farming there for about 100 years. His father, David Fisher (1729–1782), a craftsman, and his mother Mary, née West (1730–1819) lived in Norwich. Fisher was born on 26 December 1760. He was the eldest son and the third of the eleven children. After he had finished school he trained as a carpenter. He performed in some amateur dramatics. As he was handsome, and had a fine tenor voice, he attracted the attention of Giles Barrett, the manager of the Norwich Theatre Royal. After a trial appearance he was engaged by Barrett as a singer. During the 1780s Fisher's fame in and around Norwich grew and by 1788, he felt secure enough to marry. With a growing family he took the bold step in 1792 to branch out on his own and purchased a large share in a touring company owned and managed by William Scraggs, taking on the management of it. Initially the company was in competition with several other troupes, but Fisher took a more business like approach (for example paying bills promptly) and taking care of his staff of twenty or more (most of them members of the Fisher or Scraggs families but with a leaven of other professional actors), and had better equipment such as scenery (which most other touring theatres in the region did not have), and a much larger collection of good quality costumes, so gradually the competition withered away, which left north East Anglia his. Fisher catered to all classes but his decisions as to where to visit and how long to stay were made on the number of gentry and noble seats in a region, as they were the ones who would pay a premium price to be entertained. When he was to open at a location he found it advantageous to deliver advertisements to every large house within a 6-mile radius of his location. By the early 1800 Fisher had established a profitable two year circuit. Over the next decade the Scraggs gradually left the company: William and his wife died and their son left to set up on his own. In the 1810s Fisher decided that his company was profitable enough that instead of setting up his plays in inadequate play houses, he could start to build his own theatres. In 1812 he completed his first two, one in Lowestoft, in north Suffolk, and the other in Wells next the Sea on the north Norfolk coast. Over the next sixteen years, usually raising capital with share offerings to local patrons, he opened theatres in Halesworth (1812), Woodbridge (1814), Eye (1815), East Dereham (1816), Sudbury (1817), Thetford (1818), Beccles (1819), Swaffham (1822), Newmarket (1825), Bungay (1828), and North Walsham (1828). The theatres were rebuilds or new theatres, with two exceptions Halesworth and Sudbury. His theatres were of his own design to fit his companies needs. Critics considered them comfortable, neat, elegant and practical. Fisher retired from managing the company and theatres in 1827. He passed managerial control to his three sons and the theatres were left in trust to his three nephews. He carried on acting until 3 August 1832 just three days before he died. He left a legacy of a family acting tradition which lasted for over 150 years. Family On 16 March 1788 Fisher married Elizabeth Burrell (c. 1762–1814). After their marriage she joined him on stage, becoming a member of the same company. They had five children, of whom their daughter and youngest son died young. The three other boys were David (1788–1858), Charles (1792–1869), and George (1793–1864). They were initially placed in local school, but then because of the family's itinerant lifestyle were later sent to a boarding school in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire. In addition the children received extra tuition in French, dancing and music. They all followed their parents into the theatre.

The sport of Australian football has been called by a number of different names throughout its history. Since 1905, the game has been officially called \\"Australian football\\" after the formation of the Australasian Football Council. The name has been codified by the sport's governing body, the AFL Commission, as the game's official name in the \\"Laws of Australian football\\". Historically, the sport has been called \\"Victorian rules\\" (referring to its origins in Melbourne), the \\"Victorian game\\", the \\"bouncing game\\", \\"Australasian rules\\", the \\"Australian game\\" and \\"national football\\", as well as several other names. Today, the common names for the sport are \\"Australian rules football\\" or \\"football\\", and common nicknames for the sport are \\"footy\\", \\"Aussie rules\\" or sometimes \\"AFL\\" (a genericised abbreviation of Australian Football League, the sport's largest competition and only fully professional league). Historical names The first \\"Laws of Australian football\\" were established in Melbourne in 1859 by Tom Wills of the Melbourne Football Club.

Retrieved from Trove, 9 November 2011. The 1908 Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival featured a team from New Zealand, but the popularity of the sport declined there after World War I. In 1927, the Australasian Football Council changed its name to the Australian National Football Council, to acknowledge that the sport was no longer being played competitively in New Zealand. State leagues were encouraged to include the term \\"Australian National\\" in their title, with the South Australian Football League (SAFL) becoming the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in 1927, the Tasmanian Football League (TFL) becoming the Tasmanian Australian National Football League (TANFL) in 1928, and the West Australian Football League (WAFL) becoming the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL) in 1931. It was proposed that the Victorian Football League (VFL) become the Victorian Australian National Football League; however, this did not occur.National Game. – The Advocate. Published 9 August 1927. Retrieved from Trove, 9 November 2011. Several distinctions were made in the three major footballing states regarding the quality of play across different leagues. In Victoria, the League football was considered superior to Association football (not to be confused with British association football, also known as soccer); and for a time in the 1930s and 1940s, the distinction between the two competitions was necessary because they had sufficiently significant differences in rules that they were considered to be separate codes, similar to the distinction between rugby league and rugby union. In Western Australia, this distinction was also made between the West Australian Football League and the West Australian Football Association (formerly the 1st Rate Juniors competition), though the latter integrated into the WAFL reserves in 1921. There was also a distinction made in WA between the \\"coastal\\" (WAFL) and \\"'fields\\" (Goldfields Football League) leagues, who played each other regularly in the state premiership.COASTAL EIGHTEEN V.

In the 19th century, there was also a distinction made in most leagues between \\"senior\\" and \\"junior\\" football; this was not to do with age, rather with quality of play. In December 1948, a controversy occurred when Dame Enid Lyons, the Member for Darwin, referred to Australian football as \\"our national game\\" in Parliament.National Game – The Examiner.

Retrieved from Trove, 9 November 2011. Nicknames The most common nicknames for the sport are \\"footy\\" and \\"Aussie rules\\". For much of the middle part of the 20th century, particularly in Canberra, the latter was shortened further to simply \\"Rules\\", but this usage is now obsolete. The term \\"AFL\\" (an abbreviation of Australian Football League) is commonly used in areas where the game is not widely played and thus no one particular name for the sport is ingrained in the local population. The Australian Football League has encouraged competitions to include the term \\"AFL\\" in their name: the Queensland Football League changed its name to AFL Queensland in 1999, the New South Wales Australian Rules Football League changed its name to Sydney AFL in 1998, and the Australian Capital Territory Football League changed its name to AFL Canberra in 1999. Leagues outside of Australia also make use of this term. Most major newspapers in Australia use either \\"AFL\\" or \\"football\\" to refer to the sport. The derogatory term \\"aerial ping-pong\\" is sometimes used mockingly by fans of other codes to refer to the sport.An old favourite: aerial ping- pong v biff and barge – smh.com.au.

In a career that lasted from April 1918 to June 1919, he ran eight times, winning seven races and was never beaten at level weights. He was a leading two-year- old in Ireland in 1918, winning the Anglesey Stakes and the National Produce Stakes. In 1919 he won both his races and became the first black horse for 106 years to win The Derby. Background Grand Parade (foaled 1916) was bred in Ireland by the American politician Richard Croker at his Glencairn Stud. He was sold as a foal to the shipping magnate Lord Glanely for a sum of 470 gns. The colt was trained during his three-year-old season by Lord Glanely’s private trainer Frank Barling at the Falmouth House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Grand Parade’s sire, Orby, was owned and bred by Croker and had become the first Irish-trained horse to win The Derby in 1907. He went on to be a reasonably successful stallion, siring, apart from Grand Parade, the 1000 Guineas winner and leading sprinter Diadem. The female side of Grand Parade’s pedigree was undistinguished: his dam Grand Geraldine was a former cart-horse that raced only one time as a two-year-old. She produced several full-siblings to Grand Parade (Howard O'Carroll, Oakland and Ybro) that met with limited racing success. Racing career =1918: two-year-old season= Grand Parade won five of his six races as a two-year-old, beginning with the Fitzwilliam Stakes at Newmarket in April. He was then off the course for three months before returning to Newmarket to win the Soltykoff Stakes at the July meeting. He was trained for these races by Etienne G. de Mestre, the son of the notable Australian trainer Etienne L. de Mestre. Grand Parade’s season then took an unusual turn as he was relocated to Ireland where his training was supervised by a trainer named Behan. Grand Parade was unbeaten in three Irish starts, all at the Curragh, winning the Biennial Stakes, the Anglesey Stakes and the National Produce Stakes. In the autumn he was returned to England and joined Frank Barling's stable. Despite a rough sea journey from which he was given no time to recover, Grand Parade was sent straight to Newmarket for the Moulton Stakes. He finished third to Glanmerin and Knight of the Air, attempting to give fifteen pounds to the winner and five to the runner-up, with his jockey, Steve Donoghue, being criticised for giving the colt a poor ride. At the end of the year he was rated the equal second best two-year-old in Britain, two pounds below The Panther. =1919: three-year-old season= Grand Parade did not race in public in the spring of 1919. Most attention was focused on his stable companion Dominion, who finished third in the 2000 Guineas, won the Newmarket Stakes and was strongly fancied for the Derby. Grand Parade however, was in good form and earned his place in the Derby field in a private race against a four-year-old called “He”. Grand Parade conceded three pounds to the older horse (a high-class performer who subsequently won the Coronation Cup) and won comfortably. News of his impressive work became public and he became a strong Derby fancy, with odds of 100/12 (just over 8/1) being offered. Shortly before the Derby however, Grand Parade suffered an injury to a heel which interrupted his training and put his participation in doubt, causing his odds to drift out to 33/1. Glanely and Barling’s stable jockey, Arthur Smith, elected to ride Dominion at Epsom, leaving Grand Parade to be partnered by Fred Templeman. The Derby of the 1919 was the first to be run at Epsom since the First World War. The turf course, having been used by the military for almost four years, was in very poor condition, and was made \\"treacherous\\" by rain on the morning of the race. The event attracted a record crowd, including the King who was attending his first race meeting since the end of the war. Grand Parade, making his public debut for the season, started a 33/1 outsider in a field of thirteen, with the 2000 Guineas winner The Panther starting 6/5 favourite. The Panther probably lost his chance at the start, when he became highly agitated, delaying the start by several minutes. Once the race was underway, Templeman had Grand Parade in a prominent position from the start and turned into the straight in second place behind Paper Money Halfway down the straight, Grand Parade overtook Paper Money and stayed on strongly in an \\"exciting\\" finish to hold off the challenge of Buchan by half a length, with Paper Money third. The tactics of Buchan's jockey were questionable, as he switched his mount to the inside at a crucial stage, but Grand Parade's win appeared to be decisive. Indeed, according to \\"Robin Goodfellow\\" in the Daily Mail, Grand Parade's only problem came when he attempted to jump over a road which crossed the course. Grand Parade reappeared in mid-June at Royal Ascot when he was brought back in distance to one mile for the St. James's Palace Stakes in which he was matched against Glanmerin, the horse who had beaten him in his only defeat. On what proved to be his final racecourse appearance Grand Parade reversed the form to win by three quarters of a length, although on this occasion it was Glanmerin who appeared to have been given a poor ride. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Grand Parade an “inferior” Derby winner. Stud career Grand Parade retired to Lord Glanely's Exning Stud, standing at a fee of 400 gns. He sired a large number of winners but only one top-class performer, the 2000 Guineas winner Diophon, who was from his first crop of foals. Grand Parade was also the damsire of the classic winners My Love and Ambiguity. Grand Parade died at Newmarket in May 1932. LNER steam locomotive A Class A3 steam locomotive, no. 2744 was named after the horse (most Class A1/A3 locomotives were similarly named for racehorses of the era). The locomotive was destroyed in a serious accident at Castlecary in 1937 which killed 35 people, although the driver and fireman survived with only minor injuries. A replacement Grand Parade of the same class was built. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, blk. = Black, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Grand Parade was inbred 4x4x4 to 1875 Epsom Derby winner Galopin. This means that the stallion appears three times in the fourth generation of his pedigree. References External links *Newsreel of 1919 Derby Day from British Pathé.

Starring Penny Marshall and Jonathan Silverman, the film focuses on a 35-year- old woman entering a Triathlon.  Plot  Since her divorce from her husband, 35-year-old Nora Schoonover has relocated from New York to Los Angeles and has fallen into a depression. She is working a low salary job and has gotten into great debts. Will Brodsky is assigned to help her work off her debts, and they quickly fall for each other. One day, her estranged 16-year-old son, Steven, who has been living with his father since the divorce and is supposed to be on computer camp, shows up on her doorstep. A television interview with former class mate and recent Triathlon winner Mary Garritee, inspires Nora to enter and complete the Hawaiian Triathlon as a way of starting a new life. Steven, who has no interest in returning to his father in New York, promises to help and train her. Norma quickly wants to give up, and claims to be too sick to enter the Triathlon, as well as taking care of Steven. Steven feels that she is making up excuses and reminds her of the fact that she never finishes a project. Inspired by her son's devotion of helping her, Norma continues her training. Simultaneously, she grows closer to Will, who has reported her car stolen, even though he is of knowledge that she sold it to tourists. Life gets better for both Nora and Steven, until John shows up one day demanding for his son to return to New York. For one moment, Nora considers blowing it off again, lying to Will that she is seeing another man and advising Steven to go with his father. Steven does not take her advice, though, and accompanies her to Hawaii. In Hawaii, Nora gets acquainted with her competition, including Mary and Mark Wilson, while Steven attracts the attention from a young blonde. During practice of the Triathlon, Nora completes swimming, but falls off her bicycle and gets injured on her arm. She is determined to complete the Triathlon, though the accident causes her not qualify for the race. Her only hope now is a lottery, which gives some unqualified contestants a second chance. Nora loses fate in the competition, until she gets picked in the lottery, with Will showing up to support her. During the actual Triathlon, Nora finishes 58th in the swimming category, which is led by Wilson. This is followed by a 5-hour bike ride, in high temperatures and with a backfiring wind. Nora struggles with the heat, though stays focused and finished 31st overall. Steven, extremely proud of his mother, expresses his interest in moving in with her, before she starts running in the final category. By the time Mark has already finished, Nora is still in the race, but starts to lose ground and threatens to reach her physical limits. With the final mile in sight, Nora is pushed to the finish by contestant Donald Turnquist, who suffers from a lung disease. Nora collapses right before the finish, but stands up and completes the race in 13 hours and 32 minutes on the 217th place, winning her son's respect.

The Grade II-listed late Victorian building, built as one of the early mansion blocks in the capital, is thought to be named after an ancient monastery reputed to have occupied the site pre-10th century. Converted to a hotel in 1896–99, it became during the 1930s, through the Second World War and beyond, a meeting place of the British intelligence services, notably the birthplace of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and where notorious Cambridge Five double agents Philby and MacLean met their Russian handlers. St Ermin's is now part of Marriott Hotels' Autograph Collection. The hotel is owned by the family of Tei-Fu Chen, founder of Sunrider. Background The newly restored, highly theatrical lobby of the St Ermin's Hotel with undulating balcony and rich plasterwork. The St. Ermin's Hotel in St James's Park, London was originally a horse-shoe shaped mansion block built in 1887–89 to the designs of E. T. Hall (1851–1923).The Builder, 25 June 1887 (pp. 948–49). Mansion blocks (high-status, serviced apartments) were first seen in Victoria Street, London in the 1850s and remain a feature of the area today. St Ermin's Mansions was typical in both plan and elevation; Hall employed the fashionable red-brick Queen Anne style for the exterior and grouped the apartments around a courtyard which functioned both as a carriageway and garden for the residents. Four entrances led off the courtyard into the apartments (the two entrances in the side wings still exist in their original form to this day). By 1894, the building appears to have been extended along Broadway as far as St Ermin's Hill. In 1896, the building was purchased with the intention of converting it into a hotel, and by 1899, the change of use was complete. Such conversions were not uncommon. Several mansion blocks at that time were built offering apartments with a bathroom but no kitchen. Instead, an army of servants provided service in rooms plus communal dining, reading, and smoking rooms provided ground floor reception areas ready made for the needs of a hotel. The new owners embarked on a major refurbishment programme undertaken by the theatre architect J. P. Briggs (1869–1944), providing a spectacular sequence of public reception rooms with very rich plasterwork. Briggs remodelled the far end of the courtyard, creating a neo-Baroque space with raised verandah leading into a double-height foyer dominated by an undulating balcony at gallery level, accessed via a double staircase. In the eastern side of the building Briggs created a double- height ballroom with similar undulating balcony (reminiscent of theatre boxes) and unusual Art Nouveau plasterwork linked by anteroom with the former restaurant (now The Cloisters), the cove of which was decorated with lively rococo plasterwork. Following a change of ownership in 2010 the hotel has again undergone substantial refurbishment, restoring the building back to the original splendour created by Briggs. Recently the hotel has undergone an update to the main entrance of the hotel. IQ Projects designed and installed two elegant bronze pivoting doors to create a striking entrance design as guests enter the building, History The medieval city of Westminster grew up along the approach roads to Westminster Abbey, including Tothill Street and its continuation named Petty France, from the French wool merchants who had settled the street. Just south of Tothill Street was the Great Almonry, dating from the 13th century and from where alms were distributed. The site of the hotel itself, west of the Almonry, was then occupied by a chapel dedicated to St Ermin's though both the Almonry and that chapel appear to have been demolished from around the 16th century and no trace of either now remains. Nevertheless, the network of alleys and paths that developed around such institutions over the course of the medieval period developed into the irregular streets that still pattern the area around the hotel today. The residential population of Westminster rose appreciably from the 17th century, partly illustrated by the construction of St Margaret Chapel, originally known as The New Chapell, immediately to the south of the hotel site in 1636 and where English astronomer Thomas Street was buried in 1689. By 1869 it was rebuilt on a larger scale as Christ Church and demolished in the 1950s following bomb damage. The burial ground it stood around still partly survives as gardens fronting Victoria Street. The mid- to late 19th century was an era of great change during which the area was transformed by the creation of Victoria Street in 1847–51 and the construction of the District Railway. St James's Park underground station opened in 1868. Next door the hotel has the Caxton Hall, built in 1882–83, famous for the first meeting of the Suffragette Movement in 1906, infamous for the revenge assassination of Michael O'Dwyer in 1940 and a celebrity civil marriage venue in the 1950s and '60s – Roger Moore, Peter Sellars, Diana Dors and Elizabeth Taylor all took their vows there, some more than once. Secrets The St. Ermin's Hotel has a reputation for use by the UK's secret intelligence agencies. During the 1930s the hotel and the building at 2 Caxton Street were used by officers of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) located close by at 54 Broadway to meet agents and is well documented from March 1938 as the headquarters first of SIS's Section D, headed by Australian George Taylor and then as home of the SOE, working under \\"Statistical Research Department\\" cover. Among the more famous personnel known to have worked from offices in the building are Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Laurence Grand, H. Montgomery Hyde and Eric Maschwitz. The Caxton Bar, noted meeting place of London's secret intelligence officers for over 60 years Throughout the Second World War the building operated as a convenient annexe for SIS as it was surrounded by other secret organisations, including the London branch of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Palmer Street; MI9 in Caxton Street; the SIS Chief's office at 21 Queen Anne's Gate; the SIS offices in Artillery Mansions on Victoria Street and in the basement of St Anne's Mansions and the MI8 listening post on the roof of what was then the Passport Office in Petty France. In addition, the hotel was used regularly by SIS, MI5, and Naval Intelligence Division case officers, as mentioned in Snow by Madoc Roberts and Nigel West, while the SIS also interviewed prospective employees there, usually by Marjorie Maxse, the organisation's recruiter as detailed in Kim Philby's autobiography My Silent War. Shortly before the war the hotel was the venue for guerrilla warfare classes run partly by MI6, and among those working for 'King and Country' within that group at the time was Noël Coward, as well as art expert and member of the Cambridge Five spy ring, Anthony Blunt.The Daily Telegraph, 22 July 2009. From 1981, the hotel was used by St Ermins group of senior trade union leaders, who met secretly every month at the hotel to organise to prevent the left taking over the Labour Party. Four MPs also attended: Denis Howell, John Golding, Denis Healey, and Giles Radice. The group was created following the conference decision to establish an electoral college (40% trade unions, 30% members, 30% MPs) to elect the Labour Party leader and deputy. Ownership St. Ermin's Hotel is owned by Los Angeles, California, based multi-level marketing and hotel firm Sunrider International. It is part of Marriott Hotels' Autograph Collection.

It is Seville's principal green area. History Most of the grounds that were used for the park were formerly the gardens of the Palace of San Telmo. They were donated to the city of Seville in 1893 by the Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier, for use as a public park. Starting in 1911, Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier redesigned the gardens into their present shapes. In 1914 the architect Aníbal Gonzalez began construction for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, which was held partly within the park. The new buildings of the Plaza de España, a semi-circle on a plaza, were used as the offices of the fair. They have been used as settings for filmed scenes, including in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Layout 300px In preparation for the exhibition, the entire southern end of the city was redeveloped into an expanse of gardens and grand boulevards. The centre of it is Parque de María Luisa, a 'Moorish paradisical style' with a half mile of tiled fountains, pavilions, walls, ponds, benches, and exhedras. There are lush plantings of palms, orange trees, Mediterranean pines, and stylized flower beds with bowers hidden by vines. The park serves as a botanical garden. Many plant species, native or exotic, are represented, along with educational panels to inform the visitors to the park. Many birds make their home in the park, which is known for its large population of doves (for which a part of the Plaza de América is called the Parque de las Palomas, or Dove Park). There are also many parakeets living in the centre of the park, and ducks and swans in the fountains and lakes. Monuments The park is home to many monuments and to numerous ponds and fountains. Among the most famous are the Fountain of Lions (Fuente de los Leones) and the Water-lily Pool (Estanque de los Lotos). =Monument to Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer= The monument to Bécquer The monument to Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer is located in the north of the park, along the Avenida de Gustavo Adolfo Becquer. It was constructed in 1911 by Lorenzo Coullaut-Valera, in collaboration with the architect Juan Talavera Heredia and Catalan sculptor Federico Bechini. The monument consists of an octagonal base, surrounding a tree, which is built on a pedestal, the bust of the poet. To his right is Cupid as a child throwing arrows at three young women. To the left of the bust is Cupid as an adult, stabbed and dying. The two angels are in bronze, the rest of the work is in marble white. This scene is inspired by Becquer's poetry collection Rimas. =Monument to Miguel de Cervantes= The monument to Miguel de Cervantes is located on the Plaza de America, near the Royal Pavilion. It was created in 1913 by the architect responsible for the Ibero-American Exposition, Aníbal González, in collaboration with Manuel Ramos Rejano and Eduardo Muñoz. The monument is a polygonal space decorated with tiles depicting scenes from the works of Cervantes. Two statuettes, representing Don Quixote on his horse and Sancho Panza on his donkey, were found here for a long time. They have now disappeared. =The Fountain of the Lions= Fuente de los Leones, Fountain of the Lions The Fountain of the Lions (Fuente de los Leones), based on a concept by the park designer Jean Claude Nicolas Forestier, was sculpted by Manuel Delgado Brackembury in 1913. It consists of four stone lions, each carrying a shield, placed on four of the eight sides of the octagonal fountain into which they spit water. The fountain is decorated with tiles from the workshop of Ramos Rejano. The lions were installed in 1928. Badly damaged by vandals, in 1957 they were replaced by copies made by the Sevillian sculptor Juan Abascal Fuentes. The fountain was restored in 1992. Buildings The Mudejar Pavilion, now the Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla The Plaza de España was a principal building built on the park's edge to showcase Spain's industry and technology exhibits. The complex is a huge half-circle with buildings continually running around the edge accessible over the moat by numerous beautiful bridges. In the centre is a large fountain. By the walls of the plaza are many tiled alcoves, each representing a different province of Spain. Today, the plaza buildings are mainly used for government offices. The Queen's sewing box (Costurero de la Reina) was built in 1893 in the gardens of the Palace of San Telmo, as a retreat. It is a unique building that takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners. It is the oldest building in Seville in the Neo-Mudéjar style. Numerous other buildings were constructed in and around the park for the exhibition in a mix of 1920's Art Deco and mock Mudejar. Some of them were extravagant in their decor, built just before the Wall Street crash. The Guatemala building, off the Paseo de la Palmera, is an example of this elaborate style. The largest mansions from the fair, near the south end of the park, now serve as museums, including the Archeological Museum of Seville. Some of the original buildings have been replaced by more modern structures. For example, the Seville Public Library was inaugurated in 1999 by the Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo. It was nominated for the Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture in 2001. Beside the modern library is the Science Center (Casa de la Ciencia Seville), housed in the original Pavilion of Peru. Adjoining the Science Center is the Teatro Lope de Vega, a small baroque-style theatre that was also built for the exhibition.

History During the American revolution and the French revolution in the eighteenth century, Thomas Paine, an American Revolutionary, and Antoine- Nicolas Condorcet, French philosopher, tried to bring out ways to have a society free of poverty. But their ideas did not gather much attention as the French and American revolutionaries developed system of social democracy in which state intervention and central planning played a significant role.Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar \\"Assets and Poverty,\\" Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction, 2005. The failure of central planning, during the twentieth century, made it necessary to explore alternative ideas of social democracy. It was then, that the earlier ideas of Condorcet and Paine were brought to light. The kind of social democracy which is laid down by Condorcet and Paine has an important role in capital grants. Another British historian Gareth Stedman Jones describes how asset-based welfare can be a part of social democracy and can eradicate poverty. Description Asset-based welfare is concerned about the assets held by individuals rather than their basic income. Will Paxton argues that asset-based welfare concentrates on the stock of capital that one holds and not just the basic income. Stock of capital is the actual measure of well being. Asset-based policies can be directly compared to income policies. Although income policies are necessary as they allow the poor to maintain a livable standard of living, they are considered to be more of a alleviative measure of poverty, whereas, asset-based welfare is considered to be a preventive measure of poverty. Asset-based welfare requires that assets in the economy should be redistributed such that the inequality in the ownership of assets between the rich and the poor is narrowed. It is necessary to solve this issue of inequality in distribution of assets as this lays ground for inequality in all other aspects.Robert Skidelsky, \\"Asset-Based Welfare,\\" November 10, 2001. www.skidelskyr.com/ The first asset-based welfare policy was the child trust fund introduced in Britain. Another example is the saving gateway. Asset-based policies Asset-based welfare states that an economy can achieve a path towards prosperity if the individuals of the economy accumulate and acquire assets. It is difficult for the poor to accumulate assets as a substantial portion of their income is spent on consumption with very less or no income left to save. Robert Skidelsky argues that the individuals in an economy should receive an unconditional grant of resources (stock of capital) which will give the poor a platform to reach a standard of living from where they can move forward on their own towards prosperity.Robert Skidelsky, \\"Asset-Based Welfare,\\" November 10, 2001. www.skidelskyr.com/ This grant of resources can be attained by redistribution, that is transfer from the rich to the poor. Redistribution should be undertaken till the point where the negative marginal utility of the rich by sacrifice of some assets (or income) exactly offsets the positive marginal utility of the poor by gaining of assets. Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani, in their book Assets, Livelihoods and Social Policy explain that asset-based policies provides needy households the means and opportunities to accumulate assets and have greater control over their livelihoods. Asset-based policies may be of use to households which depend on their own assets for their livelihood. To avoid inequality, the policies need to focus on creating an asset base for the poor. In order for the individuals, especially the poor, to have access to assets, it becomes necessary to broaden interest in public policies, public investments and public intervention. To be successful, an asset-based policy should overcome challenges such as initial inequality, unorganized sectors of the economy, imbalance in asset building and inadequate state effectiveness.Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani (eds.), Assets, Livelihoods, and Social Policy. Washington, DC: World Bank Publications, 2008. To have a sustainable development based on asset-based policies, public intervention is important to increase access to assets such as land, housing and credit. Secondly, infrastructural investments are required which ensure better access to services, energy and market opportunities which increase the returns on assets that public holds. Finally, policies which create a healthy investment environment which can directly affect the livelihood of the poor should be framed.Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani (eds.), Assets, Livelihoods, and Social Policy. Washington, DC: World Bank Publications, 2008 Ownership of an asset generates basic income. Moreover, it encourages individuals to save more for future which ultimately leads towards the achievement and accumulation of personal wealth. This makes individuals economically independent. Michael Sherraden explains that assets give people the opportunity to realize their maximum potential and to escape poverty. Will Paxton adds that asset-based approach helps to escape poverty or prevent it before it happens. Empirical evidences Mark Schreiner, Margaret Clancy and Michael Sherraden (2002) conducted a research study at the Center for Social Development at the University of Washington at St. Louis on Individual Development Accounts (IDA), an asset-based policy. It was found that IDA led to asset building in the lower income group. It was also observed that individuals were able to plan and implement their financial goals.Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar \\"Assets and Poverty,\\" Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction, 2005. Another research study by Prof Elaine Kempson, Stephen McKay and Sharon Collard (2003) from the Personal Finance Research Centre at the University of Bristol on the savings gateway proves that asset- based policies encourage the poor to save.Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar \\"Assets and Poverty,\\" Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction, 2005.

The Baidyas have generally claimed Brahmin status but some have been associated with the Ambashtha caste or sub-caste. In the pre-colonial era of Bengal, Baidyas were regarded as the highest Hindu castes, along with Bengali Brahmins and Kayasthas. History Historian Bijay Chandra Mazumdar suggests that the Baidyas owe their origin to the Vellala Vaidyas, known for their military prowess in Southern India, who started functioning as priests some time earlier than the 10th century CE, and originally got the designation 'Vaidya' on account of their knowledge and study of the Ayurveda. The Vellala Vaidyas also served as military leaders and high civil officers apart from being priests of the Dravidian kings. These migrants, probably Ambashthas as well as the other groups like Vellala Vaidyas, started moving from north and south to Bengal during the period of the Pala Empire. They mainly dealt with medicine and other fields of study. Some of them rose to power and endeavoured to revive Vedic Hinduism in predominantly Buddhist Bengal. According to Indologist Ronald Inden, Adisur and Vallal Sena of the Sena dynasty were considered as Vaidyas. Inden also mentions the Vaidyas as \\"one of the highest of the Shudra castes\\", who possessed \\"one of the Vedas\\", the Ayurveda. However, they were considered as one of the highest among the Hindu castes in Bengal, and there are instances where they were not considered as Shudras; for example, Calcutta Sanskrit College barred Shudras from admission, initially allowing only Brahmins and Baidyas to enroll until Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar introduced admission for Kayasthas. Of note, traditionally, the Hindu community in Bengal was divided into only two varnas: Brahmins and Shudras. Most Baidyas perform rituals like wearing the sacred thread. It is believed that Vallal Sen, the legendary Sena king, divided the Baidyas into two divisions, for one of which wearing of the thread was compulsory and for the other it was optional, while some consider that a section of the Baidyas themselves started wearing the sacred thread in the 18th century when they started movements in order to improve their ritual status. Tej Ram Sharma, an Indian historian, says that Traditionally, the Brahmin, Baidya and Kayastha communities together formed the second tier in the social hierarchy of Bengal, being ranked below the rulers. In the era of the Palas, Senas, Pathans and Mughals, the ruler had to rely on their support. Baidyas shared the knowledge of Sanskrit with Brahmins. These three castes held major landholding and control over education and major professions. The terms Baidya and Vaidya also literally mean a physician in the Bengali and Sanskrit languages.

This approach evaluates how both consuming products and engaging in activities impacts the environment but it not only evaluates them at one single step, but takes a holistic picture of an entire product or activity system. This means when talking about a product and taking a life cycle thinking approach, what is actually being evaluated is the impact of the activity of consuming that product. This is because by consuming a product, a series of associated activities are required to make it happen. For example, the raw material extraction, material processing, transportation, distribution, consumption, reuse/recycling, and disposal must all be considered when evaluating the environmental impact. This is called the life cycle of a product. The overall idea of making a holistic evaluation of a system's effect can be defined as life cycle thinking. Life cycle thinking therefore also can be applied to the consumption of other socio-economic activities such as watching a movie, making arts and crafts, cooking dinner, or even doing homework. For example, renting a movie, which seems to be a harmless activity, would involve burning gasoline to drive to the video store, using electricity to power the television and DVD player, and consuming power from the remote's batteries. When trying to analyze quantitatively the effects of life cycles, limits to evaluation are subject to what assessment approach is taken because the chain reaction can become so complex that it could require decades to figure out the life cycle of a specific process. Life cycle thinking overall is a way to become more mindful of the complexities of consuming products and engaging in activities and how they affect the environment.  Goals The goal of life cycle thinking is to make people and companies more aware of how their actions impact the environment in a holistic sense rather than a one time pollution that comes as a direct result of using a product or doing an activity at one specific time. Although it is nearly impossible to undergo consumption of anything with no environmental impact, life cycle thinking can help people make better alternative decisions to mitigate their environmental impact. One of the goals of life cycle thinking is to avoid burden shifting. This is to make sure that reducing the environmental impact at one stage in the life cycle does not increase the impact at other places in the cycle. For example, plug in electric cars reduce the amount of gasoline burned but they increase the amount of electricity used which is usually generated by other polluting energy sources such as coal. Life cycle thinking can also demonstrate the benefits to technological innovation. For example, movies can now be downloaded through television service providers and gaming devices which eliminates the need to drive to a DVD rental location. By identifying pollution costs, companies can innovate to mitigate their expenses while consumers can make better alternative choices to mitigate their impact. * Avoid burden shifting * Reveal the complexity of the system triggered by an action which can have several negative environmental effects. * Connect people more directly with the impacts of their life style and demonstrate how each action has a reaction which is sometimes asymmetrically worse for the environment. * Make companies more mindful of environmental impacts of their operations. : Help identify cost cutting possibilities : Help identify less harmful operation strategies * Provide people with a framework to make choices that over a life cycle have less environmental impacts. * Create a culture focused on sustainability rather than short term gratification.  Sectors Life-cycle thinking has applications in many sectors, such as the following: = Agriculture = The agriculture/food sector is a big source environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product, from farm to table to disposal. Life- cycle thinking works to reduce these impacts at all stages of food production. Nutrition, health, well being, cultural identity and lifestyle are also factors that should be addressed when looking at the impacts of choices made in food production to ensure decreases in emissions and environmental impact do not occur at the expense of consumer wellbeing. = Manufacturing = A product Life Cycle Analysis involves all production and service processes involved in the manufacturing of a product throughout its life-cycle. This includes the production of materials needed to make the product. Since the manufacturing sector is a big emitter of pollutants and user of natural resources, pinpointing areas in which to decrease environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process is a big part of life-cycle thinking. = Energy = Drastic increases in atmospheric CO2 caused by the burning of fossil fuels, has led to the search for alternative energy sources like biofuels and renewable energy sources. To analyze whether or not these alternative sources have overall less environmental impact then conventional energy sources, life-cycle analysis is needed. Life-cycle thinking is an intricate part of finding new energy sources that have an overall smaller impact on the environment. = Waste management = Life-cycle thinking and analysis can help reduce negative environmental impacts of waste generation and management. This includes looking at ways to reduce waste production, increase recycling, and dispose of waste in a more environmentally friendly way. This is complicated by differences in benefits and burdens of in different geographical regions and the fact that effects usually occur over long periods of time. Furthermore, benefits and burdens of different processes can occur in many different forms and can be difficult to identify, quantify and compare. = Retail = Retail often accounts for a significant portion of economies and thus can have huge implications in terms of environmental impacts. The life cycle of a product in retail would include the complete supply-chain of the product, its use and disposal or end-of-life treatment. = Construction = There are many uses for life-cycle thinking in construction, especially in terms of construction waste and waste management. Finding better ways to recycle waste and prevent waste are important to reduce negative environmental impact of the construction industry. For construction products in Europe, a standardised methodology for building assessment considering Environmental Products Declarations (EPD) has been approved. The main standards are EN 15978 (buildings) and EN 15804 (products). = Transport = Finding alternative fuel sources are the biggest challenges to reducing negative environmental impact in the transportation sector. Biofuels are becoming increasing popular as an alternative to fossil fuels. Life cycle analysis can provide a fuller picture of the extent alternative fuel sources reduce emissions and overall environmental impact compared to conventional fuels. = Services = Service industries play a big part in adding environmental burdens, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions generated by travel and tourist industries. The service industry is expected to play a larger part in the modern economy as \\"dematerialization\\", or the replacement of manufactured goods by services in many firms, plays a bigger role in the economy.  Approaches  There are many different approaches to life cycle thinking that all involve looking at life cycle-generated impacts and ways to minimize these impacts. An important component to life cycle approaches is avoiding burden shifting, in other words, ensuring that improvements in one stage are not achieved at the expense of another stage. Approaches of impact measurement focus on decreasing environmental impact and resource use throughout all stages of a process. Commonly used approaches: = Life-cycle assessment = Life-cycle assessment (LCA or life cycle analysis) is a technique used to assess potential environmental impacts of a product at different stages of its life. This technique takes a \\"cradle-to-grave\\" or a \\"cradle to cradle\\" approach and looks at environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product from raw material extraction, manufacturing and processing, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, disposal and recycling. = Life cycle management (LCM)= Life cycle management is a business approach to manage the total life cycle of products and services. It follows the life cycle thinking that businesses, through the activities they must perform, have environmental, social and economic impacts. LCM is used to understand and analyze life cycle stages of products and services of a business, identify potential economic, social or environmental risks and opportunities at each stage and create ways to act upon those opportunities and reduce potential risks. = Life cycle costing (LCC) = Life cycle costing (or life cycle cost analysis) is the total cost analysis of a process or system. This includes costs incurred over the life of the system and is frequently used to find most cost-effective means for providing goods and services. = Design for the Environment = DfE Logo Design for the Environment Program (DfE) was created in 1992 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and works to prevent pollution and the reduce the risks pollution presents to humans and the environment. The main goals of the DfE are to promote green cleaning, recognize safer industrial and consumer products through safer product labeling, define best practices in production and manufacturing, and identify safer chemicals for these processes based on life cycle thinking. Having said this they must know that the air pollution in USA has the mixing of liquid, solid, gaseous, odour and noise pollution which is dangerous for human being, animals and plants. = Product service system = Product service systems (PSS) are sets of marketable products and services that work together to fulfill a user's needs. This new approach is a result of firms realizing that services in combination with products can provide higher profits and customer satisfaction then simply selling products alone. Firms that use PSS work to find ways to maximize the use of their product throughout its lifetime, using services to supplement its usage. PSS has been seen to have smaller environmental impact than traditional business models, as the focus on services has led to a decrease in material production and consumption. This applies to life cycle thinking because it involves looking at the life-cycle cost of a product (i.e. maintenance and storage costs) for a consumer and reducing that cost by providing services with the purchased good. = Integrated product policy (IPP) = Integrated product policy works to minimize environmental degradation caused by products by looking at all phases of a product's life-cycle to pinpoint where taking action is most effective. This also uses a cradle-to-grave approach when looking at a product's life. In addition, it is important that policies avoid burden shifting and do not decrease environment emissions at one stage of development at the expense of another. Policy measures used to action upon recommendations include economic instruments, substance bans, voluntary agreements, environmental labeling and product design guidelines.  Applications  There are multiple situations to which life cycle thinking can be applied, including the everyday life of consumers, business and government policy. By applying life cycle thinking to multiple aspects of the community, consumers, businesses and governments can have a largely positive aspect on the environment. This is true even if the steps taken to apply life cycle thinking are small. = Consumers = Each day consumers make choices as to which products they would like to use based on their needs and the different brands available. Most consumers do not take into consideration the environmental impacts of the product when they make their choice. For example, consumers do not consider the product's energy usage, questionable labor conditions that produced it, hazardous waste from production, impacts on the ecosystem, or pollution of air or water. Consumers can apply life cycle thinking in multiple different ways with regards to their product choices in order to reduce their impact on the environment. Firstly, consumers can choose to use products from companies who take strides towards sustainability. Many companies provide sustainability reports that consumers can read to educate themselves about the companies they buy from. By using life cycle thinking, consumers can choose a company with smaller production impacts. Primarily, consumer usage has the largest impact on the environment throughout a product's life. By using life cycle thinking this impact can be reduced. This would require educating consumers to make better choices about product usage. This can come from the companies who provide the service or product or from government agencies. For example, consumers can ask themselves what impacts they have while using the product. Ask do I really need to use this or is there a more sustainable option, such as hang drying laundry on a nice day rather than using a dryer. Consumers can educate themselves on how to become more sustainable themselves through life cycle thinking rather than relying on companies and the government to be sustainable for them. = Businesses = Businesses are responsible for many choices about their services and products each day. By applying life cycle thinking, businesses can recognize the potential impacts of their choices. They consider how each design and manufacturing decision has an effect on the environment and how they can make it more sustainable. Businesses not only take into consideration how the product is made, but also how the product will be used and disposed of by the user. Companies try to have a more sustainable product by making products recyclable or reusable. They challenging part is balancing cost and sustainable choices. Life cycle thinking allows them to see the best sustainable options but is limited when it comes to pricing these choices. Life cycle thinking for businesses entails consideration of where to obtain raw material, how to manufacture the material, transporting, distributing, using, and disposing of the product. By looking at all of these phases businesses make the best choices for themselves and the consumer for a lower impact on the environment. = Governments = Government plays a key role in life cycle thinking by establishing policies to regulate environmental impacts. By applying life cycle thinking policy makers can set standards that businesses and consumers need to meet. They do so by gathering information as a baseline of the environmental impact and use that to set goals based on knowledge from life cycle thinking. They can also use trends from supply chains of different businesses they regulate to determine where the biggest influence can be made to majorly reduce the impacts of the businesses. Government sectors can also use life cycle thinking to better educate consumers. Requiring labels on products describing the impacts the product has and how to use the products in order to reduce the impact can be an important role for the government. Regulating supply chains and consumers with policy is motivational as negative reinforcement. Life cycle thinking provides a methodology for creating those policies in order to have the most effective and most cost efficient means of reducing environmental impacts.  In policy  Many consumers, when making decisions on what to buy and what not to buy, consider the environmental impact of the particular product. Policy makers recognize this desire, and act to create policy that not only helps consumers do this, but will do so while keeping a growing economy in mind. = European policy = JRC logo There are many aspects of life cycle thinking incorporated into European policy. The Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan is a piece of legislation that aims to reduce environmental impact and consumption of resources associated with the complete life cycles of goods and services. On July 16, 2008 the European Commission presented this legislation. This proposal suggests plans on how to not only reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services, but also encourages the use of more sustainable goods and production technologies. This action plan also encourages the European Union to seek out every opportunity to innovate in industry. The Integrated Product Policy is another legislative action that Europe has taken in order to facilitate life cycle thinking. The Integrated Product Policy seeks to minimize the environmental degradation caused from the manufacturing, use and disposal of all products. This legislation looks at all aspects of the product's life cycle and takes action where necessary to reduce. The Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources was implemented on 21 December 2005 to reduce environmental impacts associated with resource use and to do this in a growing economy. The objective can be described as “ensuring that the consumption of resources and their associated impacts do not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment and breaking linkages between economic growth and resource use”. = United States policy = While the term \\"life cycle thinking\\" is not as prominent in United States policy, there are considerations of the life cycle process throughout governmental policies and programs. There are Environmental Product Declarations that are used to incorporate life cycle thinking into companies and organizations. They communicate to the consumer the environmental performance of a product or system. These declarations are based on the Life Cycle Assessment and once the assessment is complete a product or system can be certified EPD. The Environmental Protection Agency's program, Design for the Environment works with individual industry sectors to compare and improve the performance and human health and environmental risks and costs of existing and alternative products, processes, and practices. DfE partnership projects promote integrating cleaner, cheaper, and smarter solutions into everyday business practices. The Design for the Environment program is also equipped with a labeling program. They allow safer products to carry these labels and they are an indication to consumers that buying these products will be safer for the environment and their families. Also, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is a piece of legislation that incorporates life cycle thinking. While this exact phrase isn't listed. This act includes sections on advanced biofuels. In Title II of the act, it requires the creation of Biomass-based diesel which is the addition of renewable biofuels to diesel fuel and will reduce emissions by 50% as compared to petroleum biofuel. In Title III improved standards will be implemented. Life Cycle Thinking Product System  Importance  Since life cycle thinking can be involved in the choices of individual consumers, as well as policy makers and businesses, it is very important that people are well informed about the subject and its uses. Increasing awareness of the Life Cycle Analysis technique would allow companies as well as individuals to consider multiple options for a new product. After consideration of all available options, life cycle thinking would encourage selection of the most sustainable option. If more individuals practiced life cycle thinking when looking for new materials or methods, they would be more aware of how the environmental cost of ownership of products can be influenced by the running costs in energy and consumables. Life cycle thinking can help people find new ways to improve environmental performance, image, and economic benefits. Since the decisions of global businesses and government organizations have such a large impact on the environment, incorporating life cycle thinking into their actions could greatly reduce negative environmental effects and improve sustainability. Many businesses do not always consider their supply chains or the \\"end-of-life\\" processes associated with their products; likewise, government actions frequently consider their own country or region and do not take into account the impact that they could have on other regions. Not only could life cycle thinking help the environment, it can also save the company more money and improve their reputation. If a company knows where their materials come from as well as where they will end up after they have reached the end of their useful life, economic performance could be further enhanced. Also, since presently so much emphasis is placed on sustainable actions, the more a company shows its concern and respect for the environment, the better its reputation will be. In a case study on laundry detergents, it was found that washing clothes at lower temperatures resulted in energy savings and improvements in several environmental indicators, like climate change, acidification and photochemical ozone creation. Because the company understood the importance of life cycle thinking, they made the decision to conduct a Life Cycle Analysis to find the benefits of developing a different laundry detergent. Not only did the new detergents reduce environmental impact by decreasing energy consumption, it also benefitted the consumer by reducing electricity bills and helped the company by becoming a leader in the industry.

The novel was relatively well received. Plot The story revolves around Orm Rurikson, a young man who joined the crew of a Viking band as a child in the previous novel and is now their reluctant leader. This novel centres around the band pursuing Starkad, a villain based on the historical figure of legend, in an effort to reclaim their magical sword \\"Rune Serpent\\", which Starkad has stolen. Reception The novel received mostly positive acclaim from reviewers, with most citing Low's gritty realism as both the novels triumph and, for some, detraction. In a favourable review for the Yorkshire Evening Post, the reviewer states that \\"it's narrated by Low with all the gritty, down-to-earth realism that breathed such life into his first novel\\" and comments that this novel is a good illustration as to \\"why historical fiction is one of today's most rapidly-growing genres\\". Andrew Baldwin writing for the Huddersfield Examiner mirrors this viewpoint, stating \\"there’s an assured tone to the writing and the author presents a convincing portrayal of harsh times.\\". Judy Cleine, writing for the New Zealand-based Southland Times, had a somewhat different view on this realism, however, stating that \\"Low's exquisite descriptions of mindless slaughters and rapes, however, are not my particular cup of tea.\\", although does muse that \\"perhaps that is the author's intent.\\". Cleine also voiced concerns about the believability of who is \\"apparently educated enough to quote from 500-year-old non-religious Latin sources, and is also fluent in Greek and Arabic\\".

Schwartz, New York Times\\"How's the Argentina Recovery Coming Along?\\" by Tyler Cowen Debt wall Hitting the debt wall is a dire financial situation that can occur when a nation depends on foreign debt and/or investment to subsidize their budget and then commercial deficits stop being the recipient of foreign capital flows. The lack of foreign capital flows reduces the demand for the local currency. The increased supply of currency coupled with an increased demand then causes a significant devaluation of the currency. This hurts the industrial base of the country since it can no longer afford to buy those imported supplies needed for production. Further, any obligations in foreign currency are now significantly more expensive to service both for the government and businesses. This same concept has also been applied to personal debt. Specifically it has been applied to students who get in over their heads with student loans to finance their education. Current and recent debt crises =Europe=  European debt crisis  The European debt crisis is a crisis affecting several eurozone countries since the end of 2009. Member states affected by this crisis were unable to repay their government debt or to bail out indebted financial institutions without the assistance of third- parties (namely the International Monetary Fund, European Commission, and the European Central Bank). The causes of the crisis included high-risk lending and borrowing practices, burst real estate bubbles, and hefty deficit spending. As a result, investors have reduced their exposure to European investment products, and the value of the Euro has decreased. CDS showing a temporary loss of confidence in creditworthiness of certain EU countries. The left axis is in basis points; a level of 1,000 means it costs $1 million to protect $10 million of debt for five years. In 2007 the global financial crisis began with a crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the United States, and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn, the Great Recession. The European debt crisis, a crisis in the banking system of the European countries using the euro, followed later. In sovereign debt markets of PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) created unprecedented funding pressure that spread to the national banks of the euro-zone countries and the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2010. The PIIGS announced strong fiscal reforms and austerity measures, but toward the end of the year, the euro once again suffered from stress.  Causes  The eurozone crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors, including the globalisation of finance, easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices, the financial crisis of 2007–08, international trade imbalances, real estate bubbles that have since burst; the Great Recession of 2008–2012, fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses, and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses. In 1992, members of the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing to stay within the confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards.\\"How Europe's Governments have Enronized their debts,\\" Mark Brown and Alex Chambers, Euromoney, September 2005 This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.Paul Belkin, Martin A. Weiss, Rebecca M. Nelson and Darek E. Mix \\"The Eurozone Crisis: Overview and Issues For Congress\\", Congressional Research Service Report R42377, 29 February 2012. Other European debt crises = Greek debt crisis =  Timeline of Greek debt crisis  2009 December - One of the world's three leading rating agencies downgrades Greece's credit rating amid fears the government could default on its ballooning debt. PM Papandrou announces programme of tough public spending cuts. 2010 January-March - Two more rounds of tough austerity measures are announced by government, and government faces mass protests and strikes. 2010 April-May - The deficit was estimated that up to 70% of Greek government bonds were held by foreign investors, primarily banks. After publication of GDP data which showed an intermittent period of recession starting in 2007, credit rating agencies then downgraded Greek bonds to junk status in late April 2010. On 1 May 2010, the Greek government announced a series of austerity measures. 100,000 people protest against the austerity measures in front of parliament building in Athens (29 May 2011). 2011 July – November - The debt crisis deepens. All three main credit ratings agencies cut Greece's to a level associated with substantial risk of default. In November 2011, Greece faced with a storm of criticism over his referendum plan, Mr Papandreou withdraws it and then announces his resignation. Protests in Athens on 25 May 2011 2012 February - December - The second bailout programme was ratified in February 2012. A total of was to be transferred in regular tranches through December 2014. The recession worsened and the government continued to dither over bailout program implementation. In December 2012 the Troika provided Greece with more debt relief, while the IMF extended an extra €8.2bn of loans to be transferred from January 2015 to March 2016. 2014 - In 2014 the outlook for the Greek economy was optimistic. The government predicted a structural surplus in 2014, opening access to the private lending market to the extent that its entire financing gap for 2014 was covered via private bond sales. 2015 June – July - The Greek parliament approved the referendum with no interim bailout agreement. Many Greeks continued to withdraw cash from their accounts fearing that capital controls would soon be invoked. On 13 July, after 17 hours of negotiations, Eurozone leaders reached a provisional agreement on a third bailout programme, substantially the same as their June proposal. Many financial analysts, including the largest private holder of Greek debt, private equity firm manager, Paul Kazarian, found issue with its findings, citing it as a distortion of net debt position. 2017 - The Greek finance ministry reported that the government's debt load is now €226.36 billion after increasing by €2.65 billion in the previous quarter. In June 2017, news reports indicated that the \\"crushing debt burden\\" had not been alleviated and that Greece was at the risk of defaulting on some payments. 2018 - Greek successfully exited (as declared) the bailouts on August 20, 2018.  Greek debt restructuring  It stands out in the history of sovereign defaults. Greek debt restructuring of 2012 achieved very large debt relief – with minimal financial disruption, using a combination of new legal techniques, exceptionally large cash incentives, and official sector pressure on key creditors. But it did so at a cost. The timing and design of the restructuring left money on the table from the perspective of Greece, set precedents and created a large risk for taxpayer – particularly in its very generous treatment of holdout creditors – that are likely to make future debt restructurings in Europe more difficult.  Effects  To take considerations that the most characteristic feature of the Greek social landscape in the current crisis is the steep rise in joblessness. The unemployment rate had fluctuated around the 10 per cent mark in the first half of the previous decade. It then began to fall until May 2008, when unemployment figures reached their lowest level for over a decade (325,000 workers or 6.6 per cent of the labour force). While job losses involved an unusually high number of workers, loss of earnings for those still in employment was also significant. Average real gross earnings for employees have lost more ground since the onset of the crisis than they gained in the nine years before that. In February 2012, it was reported that 20,000 Greeks had been made homeless during the preceding year, and that 20 per cent of shops in the historic city centre of Athens were empty. * Irish financial crisis * Portuguese economic crisis Latin America =Argentine debt crisis=  Background  Argentina’s turbulent economic history: Argentina has a history of chronic economic, monetary and political problems. Economic reforms of the 1990s. In 1989, Carlos Menem became president. After some fumbling, he adopted a free-market approach that reduced the burden of government by privatizing, deregulating, cutting some tax rates, and reforming the state. The centerpiece of Menem’s policies was the Convertibility Law, which took effect on April 1, 1991. Argentina’s reforms were faster and deeper than any country of the time outside the former communist bloc. Real GDP grew more than 10 percent a year in 1991 and 1992, before slowing to a more normal rate of slightly below 6 percent in 1993 and 1994. The 1998–2002 Argentine Great Depression was an economic depression in Argentina, which began in the third quarter of 1998 and lasted until the second quarter of 2002. It almost immediately followed the 1974–1990 Great Depression after a brief period of rapid economic growth.  Effects  Depositors protest the freezing of their accounts, mostly in dollars. They were converted to pesos at less than half their new value. Several thousand homeless and jobless Argentines found work as cartoneros, cardboard collectors. An estimate in 2003 had 30,000 to 40,000 people scavenging the streets for cardboard to sell to recycling plants. Such desperate measures were common because of the unemployment rate, nearly 25%. Argentine agricultural products were rejected in some international markets for fear that they might have been damaged by the chaos. The US Department of Agriculture put restrictions on Argentine food and drug exports.  Debt restructuring history  President Néstor Kirchner and Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna, who presented the first debt restructuring offer in 2005 2005 Venezuela was one of the largest single investors in Argentine bonds following these developments, which bought a total of more than $5 billion in restructured Argentine bonds from 2005 to 2007. Between 2001-2006, Venezuela was the largest single buyer of Argentina's debt. In 2005 and 2006, Banco Occidental de Descuento and Fondo Común, owned by Venezuelan bankers Victor Vargas Irausquin and Victor Gill Ramirez respectively, bought most of Argentina's outstanding bonds and resold them on to the market. The banks bought $100 million worth of Argentine bonds and resold the bonds for a profit of approximately $17 million. People who criticize Vargas have said that he made a $1 billion \\"backroom deal\\" with swaps of Argentine bonds as a sign of his friendship with Chavez. The Financial Times interviewed financial analysts in the United States who said that the banks profited from the resale of the bonds; the Venezuelan government did not profit. Bondholders who had accepted the 2005 swap (three out of four did so) saw the value of their bonds rise 90% by 2012, and these continued to rise strongly during 2013. 2010 On April 15, 2010, the debt exchange was re-opened to bondholders who rejected the 2005 swap; 67% of these latter accepted the swap, leaving 7% as holdouts. Holdouts continued to put pressure on the government by attempting to seize Argentine assets abroad, and by suing to attach future Argentine payments on restructured debt to receive better treatment than cooperating creditors. The government reached an agreement in 2005 by which 76% of the defaulted bonds were exchanged for other bonds at a nominal value of 25 to 35% of the original and at longer terms. A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds out of default to 93%, but some creditors have still not been paid. Foreign currency denominated debt thus fell as a percentage of GDP from 150% in 2003 to 8.3% in 2013. * Latin American debt crisis North America * United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011 * United States debt- ceiling crisis of 2013 * Puerto Rican debt crisis (2015-present) See also * Debt * Debt of developing countries * Government debt * List of countries by credit rating * List of countries by net international investment position * List of countries by public debt * Monetary sovereignty * Odious debt * Sovereign default * State (polity) * Tax References Category:Government debt Category:Financial crises ","title":"Debt crisis"},{"id":"33689890","text":"Chytonix variegata is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

The descendant of ethnic Romanian and Slovak miners, he was born in the Hungarian segment of Austria-Hungary. Raised by his mother after his father's death in World War I, he received financial support from local benefactors, who cultivated his artistic skill, particularly as a woodcarver. A citizen of Romania after the union of 1918, he was forced to drop out of school by economic circumstances, and worked for years in various industries and businesses, while also discovering his passion for beekeeping and gardening. He was drawn into far-left politics during the Great Depression, when he came to be influenced by radical artists such as Alexandru Ziffer, Aurel Popp, Vasile Kazar and Iosif Klein, who also introduced him to avant-garde experimentation. Vida was co-opted into the Union of Communist Youth and subsequently the Communist Party, producing propaganda art for both; this activity led to his temporary arrest in 1932 and 1933. A labor organizer, he helped establish the Artists' Trade Union and its branch in Baia Mare. Having trained as a gunner in the Romanian Land Forces, Vida made repeated attempts at joining the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. Though imprisoned and expelled upon illegally crossing the border with Czechoslovakia, he resumed the effort and finally reached Republican Spain in early 1938. He served for a few months under Nicolae Cristea and Valter Roman, before the Brigades were withdrawn from the Battle of the Ebro. Vida survived the retreat into France, surrendering to the National Gendarmerie. Vida moved between French internment camps, finally being sent to Gurs; he also continued to work as a propaganda artist, reaching an international audience. A participant in prisoner revolts before and after the fall of France, he was dispatched as a laborer to Nazi Germany, but eventually made his way to Northern Transylvania. As a Romanian national in Regency Hungary, Vida was under continuous supervision. His studying at the Hungarian School of Fine Arts was interrupted by stints in a labor battalion, though he managed to escape during the Siege of Budapest. He rejoined the Romanian army and, by the end of World War II, was stationed in Skalica. Returning to Baia Mare, in his thirties he emerged as a favorite artist of Romania's communist regime and became a deputy in the Great National Assembly, but voiced criticism of the regime's artistic standards. He repeatedly tried to resist the rise of Socialism Realism, and depicted Expressionism as a more authentically revolutionary current. Vida's views were vindicated in the 1960s, when his synthesis of folk art and Expressionism was more fully assimilated by the communist establishment. He won both controversy and praise for his series of monumental pieces, including his Soldier's Memorial of Carei and his homage to the victims of the Moisei massacre. Made a full member of the Communist Party Central Committee in 1971, and a part-member of the Romanian Academy three years later, he was awarded numerous distinctions, including the Star of the Socialist Republic of Romania. In his last years, he drifted away from the Expressionist standard to absorb more influences from handicrafts and religious art. Biography =Origins and early life= In some Communist Party records, Vida was described as having \\"Magyar ethnicity\\".Dobre et al., p. 616 However, the artist's paternal ancestors were ethnic Romanians from the Austrian Empire: grandfather Simion Vida was a Greek Catholic from Iapa, working at the hammermill of Nagybánya (Baia Mare).Bodea, pp. 8–9 His fifth child, Iosif, who worked his entire life as a miner, married a Rozalia Krupiczer of Cavnic. Her father was a Slovak colonist to the region.Bodea, p. 9 Gheza was born on February 28, 1913 at Nagybánya, as Baia Mare was then known. The city was at the time in Szatmár County, Kingdom of Hungary (itself part of Austria-Hungary). His exact birthplace was the family home, located very near to Valea Roșie Mine.Bodea, pp. 9, 10 The Hungarian-sounding name \\"Gheza\\" (or \\"Géza\\") was selected to honor a workmate of Iosif Vida's. Rozalia preferred to call him \\"Victor\\", since he turned out to be her only surviving child;Bodea, p. 9 the couple had had seven other children.Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6 Despite being afflicted with lung problems, Iosif was drafted into World War I, and was heavily wounded on the Serbian Front; he died in his home in 1915. This forced Rozalia to seek employment as a housemaid in the home of Teofil Dragoș, a Romanian jurist and politician, where Gheza would spend his early infancy and early childhood.Bodea, pp. 9–11 According to biographer Gheorghe I. Bodea, the future sculptor grew up as a socialist by witnessing the miners' strikes and protests during the Aster Revolution and the Soviet experiment; Dragoș's home was located outside Baia Mare prison, where most protesters were interned during the Hungarian–Romanian War.Bodea, p. 10 Following the region's union with Romania, Vida was sent to the new Romanian school of Baia Sprie. Headmaster Alexandru Mouje, who was a passionate woodcarver, channeled the boy's creativity, encouraging him to create statuettes of animals (most of which are now lost).Bodea, pp. 10–11, 14 Gheza also enjoyed traveling into the Gutâi Mountains, which he much later described as a \\"fairy-tale land\\".Bodea, p. 11 He took up rock collecting, and on one occasion was nearly killed after sliding into a mine shaft to pick up a more unusual stone.Bodea, p. 13 In 1923, he created his first complex works in wood, depicting peasants at their wedding and funeral ceremonies.Bodea, p. 14 He had by then become encouraged by the artistic boom of his native city: the Baia Mare School was experiencing its peak moment and, Vida recalled, \\"easels and working painters were on every street corner.\\"Bodea, pp. 11–12 Dragoș was impressed by Vida's skills, and, wanting him to succeed in life, sponsored his full tuition at Gheorghe Șincai High School. However, Rozalia fell ill in 1928, when Gheza was in his terminal year; this prompted him to drop out of school and begin training as an apprentice gardener in Satu Mare.Bodea, p. 14 He returned to Baia Mare after only a few months, and began working as a beekeeper and gardener for a friend by the name of Lakatos. This venture ended abruptly when Lakatos, a member of the outlawed Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), was arrested, then jailed; Vida moved on to do contingent work at Phoenix Factory, before taking and a job as a lumberjack, then a minor position for the Romanian Railways.Bodea, pp. 14, 17. See also Dobre et al., pp. 616–617 He reportedly worked briefly as a nightwatchmanMarinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6 and as a gold miner in Baia Sprie.Vida, p. 27 According to a later record by his friend Mihai Florescu, throughout the 1930s Vida was still primarily a beekeeper.Bodea, p. 40 =Communist beginnings= \\"Peasant Whetting the Scythe\\", 1928 woodcut by Gyula Derkovits, who inspired Vida's early sculptures While he could no longer pursue training in art, Vida still drew, sculpted and carved, also taking advice from vacationing artists such as Petre Abrudan, Alexandru Ciucurencu and Jenő Szervánszky.Bodea, p. 14 He befriended the local artist Géza Kádár and his piano-teaching wife Elisabeta. Both fostered his artistic education, and put him into contact with artist Béni Ferenczy.Vida, p. 25 He appears to have been heavily influenced by Gyula Derkovits, transposing into reliefs what Derkovits had achieved with engravings.Vida, p. 25 Vida's new sculptures included the first of his \\"peasant-and-scythe\\" pieces, which alluded to his artistic incorporation of social protest.Bodea, p. 15; Vida, p. 25 Abrudan also made Vida a member of his Greco-Roman wrestling team, which doubled as a PCdR recruitment cell; Vida's contribution there also included an engraving of wrestlers, reused by Abrudan as the core design for his club's advertising posters.Bodea, pp. 14–15 As Romania's mining industry was heavily hit in the Great Depression, in 1929–1932 Baia Mare became the center of a growing protest movement and an electoral pool for the PCdR's Peasant Workers' Bloc.Bodea, pp. 15–19 While not yet a PCdR member, Vida recalled being a full participant in the strike movement at Phoenix.Bodea, p. 17 A fellow artist, Iosif Klein, took him into his communist art club and began influencing him politically; Vida turned to more explicitly revolutionary themes, including his first-ever portraits of peasant rebels such as Horea and Pintea.Bodea, pp. 17–18 Through Klein's influence, his work accommodated echoes from the European avant-garde, as well as from African sculpture; this blend appeared in his primitivist carvings of \\"monkey-men\\".Vida, p. 25 In 1932, Vida joined the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), being directly supervised by the more senior communist Ileana Wolf. That year, he produced UTC propaganda art, alongside Ioan Décsey.Bodea, p. 18. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6 He was arrested in a Siguranța roundup and held in custody for a week, during which he was reportedly beaten; he never agreed to cooperate with the authorities, and, upon release, remained under surveillance.Bodea, p. 18 Klein having moved to Bucharest, Alexandru Ziffer took charge of the communist artists in Baia Mare, whose contribution included correcting Vida's drawings and offering him more artistic input.Bodea, pp. 19, 22–24. See also Vida, p. 25 Vida himself referred to this new art movement as \\"giving form to the aspirations of the people, to its fight for freedom\\", singling out Vasile Kazar as its leading exponent.Bodea, p. 23 Still engaged in political agitation, he was tasked with unionizing the charcoal burners of Ulmoasa. As he recalled, the experience put him into contact with extreme poverty, and also opened him up to their folklore, which was the peasants' sole entertainment.Bodea, p. 20 Following the Grivița strike and a countrywide clampdown in February 1933, Vida was again in Siguranța custody, under a preemptive lock-down. He and his colleagues were released in short while for lack of evidence.Bodea, p. 21 Occasional arrests still occurred in 1933. In early 1934, Vida attended the clandestine UTC meeting in Cluj, where he presented a report on the issue.Bodea, pp. 21–22 His engravings were being used in protest art for the PCdR, with proceedings going to the International Red Aid.Bodea, pp. 23–24 In November, he received what is probably the first of his artistic reviews. Published in Bányai Lapok, it praised Vida as a \\"man of the future\\" and enemy of all things kitsch, noting the interest that art collectors were taking in his sculptures.Bodea, p. 25. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6 In 1935, Ziffer obtained that Vida be formally admitted into the Baia Mare art colony.Bodea, p. 25 =Spanish Civil War= In 1935–1936, Vida was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, serving with the 32nd Artillery Regiment in Satu Mare, where he continued to sculpt.Bodea, pp. 25, 38, 69 He was still performing his duties when news of the Spanish Civil War reached him. Reading up on articles by Scarlat Callimachi, Ion Călugăru, Zaharia Stancu or Alecu Constantinescu, Vida became passionate about defending the Second Spanish Republic.Bodea, p. 38 The thought of volunteering for the International Brigades came to him while in Satu Mare, and he contacted his PCdR liaison, Francisc Wolf-Boczor, to ask for approval.Bodea, p. 38; Roman, p. 141 Upon returning home, he graduated into the PCdR, and quickly became one of its regional leaders. He had resumed ownership of his father's home, which occasionally hosted illegal party conferences.Bodea, p. 25 In tandem, he worked with Aurel Popp and János Thorma to organize a regional artists' congress, with representatives from Maramureș, the Banat, and Transylvania at large. Convened on June 14, 1936, it became the nucleus of a Fine Artists' Trade Union, which had Popp and Ziffer among its leaders.Bodea, pp. 26–29 Exactly a year later, after repeated efforts to reconcile the factions of Baia Mare School into a single branch of the Trade Union, Vida gave up and established a chapter comprising mostly his left-wing colleagues; its leader was Thorma, but Vida was ensured a place on the steering committee.Bodea, pp. 28–29. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6 The group's first show in August 1937 was interrupted by the Romanian Police, which confiscated three of Vida's reliefs over worries that they spread communist ideology.Bodea, pp. 30, 40 Despite this, the show garnered positive reviews from local critics, with several more being held into October 1937.Bodea, pp. 30–31 Eventually, in October 1937, Vida set out on his clandestine journey to Spain: telling his mother that he was merely taking a trip to Izvoarele, he backpacked along Boczor and another activist into Czechoslovakia, rallying with other volunteers at Veľká Sevljuš.Bodea, p. 39; Roman, pp. 142–144 However, this illegal crossing made them targets for repression by Czechoslovak Gendarmes. According to Vida's recollection, these were members of the White émigré community who beat the volunteers up as reprisals for their communist beliefs.Roman, p. 145 Vida and his comrades were then sentenced to one month in prison, despite the efforts of the Communist deputy for Sub-Carpathian Rus' to grant them asylum as political refugees.Roman, p. 145 The prisoners were finally released and expelled to Romania on December 1, 1937.Bodea, pp. 38–39; Roman, pp. 145–146 The group, which also included Ion Călin,Roman, p. 146 immediately returned by the same route, escaping rearrest and reaching Košice, then Prague.Bodea, p. 39 Vida made his way into Austria on his second attempt, walked over a frozen marshland into Switzerland, and then crossed into France. He spend a short period in Paris, where he received support from an activist working for the Romanian pavilion at the Paris Exposition, moved south to Béziers, and finally avoided checks by the border police to reach Spain in late January 1938.Bodea, p. 39; Roman, pp. 149–152 In the International Brigades, Vida was most often known as \\"Grigore\\"—his nom de guerre and, increasingly over time, his artistic pseudonym.Bodea, p. 40 He was initially stationed for instruction at Casas- Ibáñez, and then assigned along five other Romanians to the \\"Rosa Luxemburg\\" Artillery Regiment.Bodea, p. 42; Roman, p. 152 However, he requested and obtained a transfer to the Romanian Artillery Regiment, being assigned to the newly-created \\"Tudor Vladimirescu\\" Battery, under Nicolae Cristea and Valter Roman.Bodea, pp. 42–43; Roman, p. 153 Regimental colleagues included artist Zdeněk Přibyl.Bodea, pp. 43, 46 A card-carrying member of the Communist Party of Spain in 1938–1941,Dobre et al., p. 616 Vida was stationed outside Tarragona, seeing action during the defense of Levante and the Battle of the Ebro. As recalled by his peers, he was still intensely artistic, using his free time to carve up peasant figures and \\"monster heads\\".Bodea, pp. 40, 44–46 In his memoirs of the conflict, Valter Roman notes that Vida enjoyed \\"great sympathy from his comrades in arms\\", his art evoking memories of home.Bodea, pp. 45–46 Vida also published political cartoons and front-line drawings in the Battery's newspaper.Bodea, p. 45 Outside of battles, he attended political sessions, maintained a small regimental library, and recalled being in the attendance for visits by Dolores Ibárruri and Paul Robeson.Bodea, pp. 45–48 Vida also recalled having met cellist Pablo Casals.Roman, pp. 160–165; Vida, p. 25 =Internment= In September 1938, the League of Nations obtained that Republican Spain withdraw the Romanian troops away from the fighting.Bodea, pp. 49–50 Vida last fought in Spain in January 1939, during the Catalonia Offensive, when Francoists drove the International Brigades northward, toward the French border. He helped with logistics during the hasty retreat, notably by rebuilding a wooden bridge across one of the regional rivers.Bodea, pp. 51–52 On February 9, he crossed the Pyrenees and surrendered to the National Gendarmerie; the following day, he was interned in the improvised camp of Saint-Cyprien.Bodea, pp. 53–54 In summer 1939,Bodea, p. 60 he was dispatched to a more permanent, larger compound, the camp of Gurs. As \\"Grigore\\", Vida illustrated the prisoners' political magazine with images of the home country, and produced linocuts of his internment; these were paid by other inmates with extra rations of food.Bodea, pp. 55–57, 61 Some of his drawings were smuggled out of Saint-Cyprien inside a prosthetic leg. The Quaker Peace Council republished these in England, sending Vida a lump payment of 500 pound sterling.Bodea, pp. 57–58 With Přibyl and Blasco Mentor, he established the art school of Gurs, which lasted to summer 1940, and organized festivities marking the 150th anniversary of the French Revolution.Bodea, pp. 61–63. See also Vida, p. 25 When World War II broke out in September 1939, Vida and his fellow prisoners were in open conflict with the French authorities, and this prolonged itself during the Battle of France. On Labor Day 1940, the prisoners went on strike and faced a series of punishments.Bodea, pp. 64–65 The entire camp population asked to join the French Foreign Legion, and, when ignored, staged another protest, which broke up when camp guards fired into the crowd; however, resistance continued inside the barracks, where Vida and his colleagues scrummed together, preventing their adversaries from capturing any single person.Bodea, pp. 64–65 Following the fall of France in June 1940, Vida's former colleagues of Gurs destroyed most of his surviving works, preventing their seizure by Nazi occupiers; though an attempt was made to smuggle some of his sculptures to Paris, they were lost in the confusion.Bodea, p. 63 Taking temporary charge of Gurs, Vichy France broke up prisoners' solidarity and dispatched various groups to other camps; Vida ended up at Argelès-sur-Mer, in Vichy's territory.Bodea, p. 65 Events in Romania also resulted in his change of national status: Baia Mare had been included in Northern Transylvania, taken over by the Hungarian Kingdom following the Second Vienna Award. According to Bodea, Vida was shocked by this development, since, he believed, it meant surrendering to fascism.Bodea, p. 65 Vida's time at Argelès was ended abruptly in March 1941, when Vichy decided to liquidate the camp and deport its population to Argelès. A prisoners' rebellion was broken up by the Gendarmes, but eventually only part of the prisoners were taken to the colonies; Vida found himself labeled a prisoner of war and then deported as a forced laborer in Gau Württemberg-Hohenzollern.Bodea, p. 65 He finally became a farmhand in the Black Forest, outside Stuttgart. His employer Karl Rimm allowed him to carve a gateway in Maramureș style.Bodea, p. 65; Vida, p. 25 Throughout the interval, Vida planned to make his way back home. With assistance from some affiliates of Germany's Communist Party, he obtained a work permit which allowed him to travel, and finally reached Baia Mare in November 1941.Bodea, p. 65. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 6; Vida, pp. 25–26 =In Budapest and Skalica= Still holding a Romanian passport, Vida was required to present himself for controls by the Hungarian Royal Gendarmerie.Bodea, pp. 67–68 In summer 1942, deciding to evade police scrutiny, he made a clandestine trip to Budapest. Here, he resumed his friendship with Béni Ferenczy, who was an agent of the Hungarian Communist Party; writer Pál Aranyosi also put him into contact with the communist underground, which co-opted him for a scheme to blow up a bridge at Szolnok.Bodea, pp. 67–69 When trying to register for classes at the School of Fine Arts, Vida was listed among the category of \\"foreign refugees\\". The police of his native city allowed him to transfer, and finally Vida matriculated, studying under Jenő Bori.Bodea, pp. 67–68. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7; Vida, p. 26 This interval gave him a better understanding of classical canons, and especially of archaic Greek sculpture, which became one of his subject matters.Vida, p. 26 Financially supported by his colleagues in Maramureș, he produced works which took liberties with carving styles, and took a research trip to Székely Land, where he took in new elements of crafting.Vida, p. 26 He became romantically involved with Géza Kádár's daughter Ecaterina, who was attending the Franz Liszt Academy of Music.Vida, p. 26 In late 1942, Vida was forced to join the Romanian Labor Company at Szinérváralja (Seini); his imprisonment was postponed before January 1943, when he was allowed to resume his studies.Bodea, p. 68. See also Dobre et al., p. 617 In March, he was given permission to exhibit new works at Kolozsvár (Cluj).Bodea, p. 68 Vida was again forcefully conscripted in summer 1943, and again dispatched to Szinérváralja—one of some 15,000 Romanians to be held in custody under this forced-labor regime.Bodea, pp. 69–70. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 Again freed before the end of the year, he resumed his activity with the Baia Mare Trade Union, helping to organize its exhibit in January 1944. He married Ecaterina and intended to settle down, but in May was again sent to do forced labor, this time for the brewery in Kőbánya.Bodea, pp. 70–71. See also Dobre et al., p. 617; Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7; Vida, p. 26 At home, his work continued to be exhibited, and was the centerpiece of a Kolozsvár exhibit in August 1944.Bodea, p. 70 By then, however, the Nazi intervention in Hungary had endangered the Vida family and Gheza's artworks. The Arrow Cross Party endorsed the roundup and mass extermination of Hungarian Jews. This also meant that Jewish art collectors were stripped of their belongings, allowing Vida's sculptures to fall into government hands.Bodea, p. 71 Vida was in Kőbánya when King Michael's Coup took Romania into the Allied camp. Hiding during the Siege of Budapest, he surrendered to the Red Army and his fellow Romanians on January 1, 1945.Bodea, pp. 72–73. See also Vida, p. 26 Traveling by foot to Nagykáta, then to Arad, he enlisted as a volunteer in the Romanian Land Forces. He returned to action during the Bratislava–Brno Offensive, making his way to Skalica; it was here that he caught news of the German Instrument of Surrender, returning to Arad in May 1945.Bodea, pp. 72–74 Upon his arrival there, he began sketching various sculptural ensembles, usually showing peasants in revolt or dancing the hora. They showed influences from Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and were generally primitivist.Vida, p. 26 Signing up to a Popp's manifesto, which reestablished the Baia Mare Trade Union as an explicitly socialist and democratic club, Vida was still in uniform and stationed at the garrison in Cluj to August 1945.Bodea, pp. 74–77. See also Vida, p. 26 Over those months, the communist organ Scînteia celebrated his return to Romania, calling him a \\"revolutionary artist\\" who had \\"ceaselessly fought against fascism\\".Bodea, pp. 76–77, 79 Vida rejoined the PCdR that same year,Dobre et al., pp. 616–617 before returning to Baia Mare. Co-opted by Lidia Agricola, he began lecturing at the local Free School, which was a reincarnation of the interwar art colony.János Kristof Murádin, \\"From Easel to Professorship. The Creation and Consolidation of Hungarian Professional Fine Arts Education in Transylvania\\", in Historia Actual Online, Issue 34, Spring 2014, p. 139 The subsequent interval was one of expansion for the Communist Party, now styled \\"Romanian Workers' Party\\", or PMR. In early 1948, it set up the Romanian People's Republic. During this process, Scînteia published articles more critical of Vida's artistic vision, claiming that he had lapsed into \\"formalism\\".Bodea, p. 78 The sculptor's son Gheorghe notes that these attacks referred to Vida Sr's lack of interest in Socialist Realism and Soviet art, since he felt bothered by their \\"photographic rendition of reality and new-man optimism.\\"Vida, p. 26 However, in 1948–1948 Vida was president of the \\"Verification Commission\\" in Satu Mare, tasked with assessing the loyalties of recent PMR inductees.Dobre et al., p. 617 October 1948 marked Gheza's participation in the state-sponsored Transylvanian Art Exhibit, and more praise published by various critics.Bodea, pp. 80–81. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 He was commissioned to work on the Liberation Obelisk of Baia Mare, which also included a series of reliefs.Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 In December 1948, Vida was also hosted by the Bucharest Republican Palace, receiving a prize from the Ministry of Arts in January 1949.Bodea, pp. 81–82. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 This was followed in 1953 by Romania's State Prize.Bodea, p. 83; Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 =Expressionism vs. Socialist Realism= From 1950 to 1954, while his work went on its first international tours, Vida was a professor at the Baia Mare High School of Arts,Bodea, p. 83 established following the incorporation of Agricola's Free School as a state-run institution. It was at this stage that critic N. Argintescu-Amza identified Vida as an Expressionist à la Ernst Barlach.Bodea, p. 81 Gheorghe Vida referred to his father's overall contribution as a synthesis of Greek sculpture, peasant woodcarving, and \\"Northern Expressionism\\".Vida, p. 25 As argued by Vida Jr, Expressionism was mostly spontaneous in Gheza's work, appearing in the 1940s and resembling Barlach's only by coincidence: the Romanian artist first encountered Barlach's pieces in the late 1950s, while visiting East Germany.Vida, p. 26 Vida Sr accepted the label in a 1972 interview, when he highlighted the \\"revolutionary role\\" of Expressionist art: \\"I myself was an Expressionist, perhaps I still am one.\\"Bodea, pp. 81–82 In his 1951 letters to Popp, he had spoken out against subsuming artists to a singular style, noting that revolutionary art also needed to display an artist's individuality and originality.Bodea, p. 82 However, in 1952–1958 Vida risked upsetting communist censors, and had to embrace Socialist Realism—though he continued to make discreet references to his earlier avant-garde works.Vida, pp. 26–27 He generally abandoned his work in wood and came to use mostly stone and plaster; this period saw him designing the Miner's Monument in Baia Mare, described by his son as impersonal.Vida, p. 26 Reinterpreting the core themes of his art, he reemerged in 1954 with a relief depicting Pintea. This was widely praised by the official press: in Scînteia, engraver Ligia Macovei noted that it was superior to most other works presented at the time, \\"suffused with ideas\\" and displaying \\"authentic figures\\".Bodea, p. 83 Acknowledged as an official artist, Vida was able to obtain that Popp, who had been ignored and censored by the regime, be admitted into the Romanian Artists' Syndicate (UAP) in 1955.Dumitru Păcuraru et al, Aurel Popp. Între două culturi, pp. 380, 444. Bucharest: RAO Publishing, 2017. In 1957, the communist government recognized Vida as an Eminent Master of Art.Bodea, p. 84; Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7 Co-opted by the People's Democratic Front (formed around the PMR), Vida took a seat in the Great National Assembly after the election of that February; he represented Ocna Șugatag.Dobre et al., p. 617. See also Bodea, p. 84 Alongside Kazar, Vida organized a retrospective of his work in 1958, earning much praise from critics Petru Comarnescu, Dan Hăulică and Eugen Schileru; also in 1957, he presented sculptures at the Venice Biennale Romanian pavilion and the Socialist Art Exhibit in Moscow.Bodea, pp. 84–85. See also Dobre et al., p. 617; Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 7; Vida, p. 27 He toured Italy to get a direct experience of Renaissance art, being especially impressed with Lorenzo Ghiberti's work on the Florence Baptistery.Vida, p. 27 Rebelling against Socialist Realism, in 1961 he produced \\"Toward the Mine Chute\\". As noted by Gheorghe Vida, its \\"simplicity and severity\\" were meant to clash with the official rhetoric and with visions of miners as \\"culture heroes\\". With this work, Vida Jr writes, his father was entering an \\"archetypal phase\\".Vida, p. 27 By then, the regime itself was discarding Socialist Realism (see De- Stalinization in Romania). Exhibits of Vida's art were frequent over the following years, and included a special showing of his Saint-Cyprien and Gurs linocuts at the Republican Palace, marking the PMR's 50th anniversary in 1961.Bodea, p. 86 He presented himself in the Assembly election, winning a new term as a representative of Dragomirești.Dobre et al., p. 617 When he himself turned 50 in 1963, there was a national celebration in his honor, with Contemporanul deeming him Romania's \\"most original artist\\".Bodea, p. 86 Government indicted him into its Order of Labor, 1st Class, and arranged for his work to also be displayed in Warsaw; in 1964, it also bestowed upon him its highest professional recognition, deeming him an Artist of the People.Bodea, pp. 86–87; Dobre et al., p. 617. See also Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 8 Vida himself co-opted Ciucurencu for a less formal exhibit in Prague, which was a retrospective for showing of both artists' contributions.Bodea, p. 87 He was also commissioned for a monumental work, the Romanian Soldier's Memorial in Carei, blending into it the various influences of folk art.Bodea, pp. 87–88; Vida, p. 27 That monument was in deep contrast with military tradition, prompting criticism from Army representatives. Vida only agreed to some minor concessions, which included a set of reliefs done in a more conventional, \\"descriptive\\", format.Vida, p. 27 In tandem, Vida served on the PMR executive board for Maramureș Region, and, also in 1963, headed the Regional Arts and Culture Committee. Following a new election in March 1965, he took the Assembly seat for Rozavlea.Dobre et al., p. 617 That year, Vida expanded on his large-scale works with a monument to the 30 Romanians killed in the Moisei massacre of 1944. It was initially a composition bringing together twelve sessile oaks handpicked by Vida and carved by him to resemble \\"characters from the Maramureș folk stories\\"; from 1972, he replaced them with more durable stone reproductions.Bodea, pp. 88–93, 95–96. See also Vida, p. 27 According to travel notes by writer Geo Bogza, it was perfectly comparable to Constantin Brâncuși's more famous monumental complex in Târgu Jiu, tough also inspired by the Dacian sanctuary of Sarmizegetusa Regia.Bodea, pp. 93–94 Critic Constantin Prut referred to Vida's work as his \\"act of patriotism\\", \\"the most expressive and most stirring sculptural ensemble in these last decades of Romanian art.\\"Bodea, p. 95 =Final period= With Nicolae Ceaușescu as its General Secretary, the PMR renamed itself Romanian Communist Party (PCR). On July 24, 1965, Vida was inducted by the PCR's Central Committee, but only as a junior member. He had by then graduated from the University of Marxism-Leninism in its night school version, and was serving on the new Politburo of Maramureș County.Dobre et al., pp. 616, 617 In 1966, Ceaușescu also received Vida into the Order of Tudor Vladimirescu, 3rd Class.Dobre et al., p. 617 From 1968, with articles and interviews in Scînteia, Vida described his debt to the \\"purely authentic\\" folk art of Maramureș, urging its preservation and promotion.Bodea, pp. 96–98 He designed a monument commemorating the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan; complete in 1972, it was meant to be permanently displayed somewhere in the Apuseni Mountains. In 1968, he was working on a monumental portrait of Gelou, to be erected near Gherla.Bodea, p. 96 Also that year, Vida was elected UAP Vice President (reelected in 1973), receiving the Order of Cultural Merit.Bodea, pp. 96, 102. See also Dobre et al., p. 617; Marinescu & Brezovszki, p. 8 On August 12, 1969, Vida was promoted to full member of the PCR Central Committee; in 1971, he became a Hero of Socialist Labor.Dobre et al., pp. 616, 617.

During the renovation of the facade in 2010, the oldest parts of the castle on the north-east side were revealed. In 1600, Castle Saalhof was extended.  History  A marble relief from 1606 above the main entrance documents the rebuild. *In 1296, the castle is apparently owned by “Konrad, the devil”. *In 1423, the first verifiable owner of the archiepiscopal period is Oswald Eisenstang (= called Oswald the iron rod). *In 1584, ownership passes to the Amann family from Judendorf and Saal. *In 1600, Christoff Amann from Judendorf and Saal rebuild the castle in a style, typical for the region. The marble relief and emblem above the main entrance, laid in 1606, as well as a large part of the interior arrangement derive from this time. *In 1634, the castle comes to the Riedl family following the marriage of Amanns’ daughter Maria: An emblem on the first floor, laid in 1661, testifies to the marriage of Mathias Riedl from Saal and Maria Riedlin born Stöcklin from Judendorf. *In 1714, the castle is transferred to the Kobald family from Dambach and Moll. During this time, the castle has its own chapel inside. *In 1840, the castle comes into rural possession, it is bought by the landlord Josef Zehentner from the small village of Weißbach near Lofer. He is a direct ancestor of the Rieder family which owns the castle now. *In 1971, the two old stable blocks (with roof ridges from 1828 and 1586) were demolished and new ones constructed. *In 1975, the road to Maishofen which crossed the yard of Castle Saalhof in former times is moved to the new crossing. *Since 1992 the castle, the Meier‘s house and the Christian wayside shrine in the garden stand under federal conservation of monuments and historic buildings. *In 2004, Hermann and his wife Kathrin Rieder take over the property.  Current use  Castle Saalhof in summer Since 2006 newly renovated apartments within the castle are available. In 2010, the facade was renovated and the old colours from the 17th century have been restored. The Meier’s house on the eastern side was earlier the dwelling of the curator (Meier), farm labourers and servants. The date in the roof ridge - the year of construction - is 1686. In 1814 the Meier’s house was used as a school for Maishofen. The castle and Meier’s house are private buildings.

The line was opened between 1863 and 1868. It is also known as the Staatslijn \\"B\\". At Bad Nieuweschans, a connection with the German railway network is provided through the Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway.  History  The Frisian Port of Harlingen was meant to be a segment in an international transport-chain between Great Britain and Eurasia. Already in 1845 some Belgian engineers Xavier Tarte and Castillion Du Portail projected and developed a Pan-European Railwayjunction between Spain via Paris, Wallonië Maastricht- Arnhem- Zwolle onto Harlingen via Leeuwarden, and from Harlingen via Leeuwarden, Groningen and the German border, Nieuweschans onto the Northern German ports Bremen-Hamburg. It was not until the 1860s before a part of this plan could be completed by the former Dutch government, the administration of mister Thorbecke and the Law to reorganise the statal debts, mr Van Hall. This administration committed the railway-constructions all over the Netherlands outside the so-called pre-occupied presumen 'Economical heart' the 'Randstad-Holland' including the political advanted main-seaports Rotterdam and above all, Seaport Amsterdam-IJmound. Benearth the junction (vlissingen-port)-Breda- Tilburg, With the railway junction Harlingen- Leeuwarden (1863) and Leeuwarden - Leer Germany (1867) Harlingen was the very first harbour that by Administration of the Dutch government directly had been connected with the European hinterland. Although Harlingen-port was advanced in connecting seaways at the time (until the 1850s) Harlingen did not have any changes to develop its Port and direct Railway connection with Northern Europe, Russia Scandinavia and Baltic States. Moreover, by this time, Harlingen Port must take her opportunity, to get better connected by Railway because of the Law 'Natura-2000' and 'Geomorfological regulations seabed biothope'. The present administration of the ministry of Infrastructure and Environment (I&M;) refuses any co-operation in developing Port Harlingen as a partner-port of Randstad ARA-Mainports.

It was the first publication of Grotius, a prominent jurist and Remonstrant, concerned with the Calvinist-Arminian debate and its ramifications, a major factor in the politics of the Netherlands in the 1610s. The Ordinum pietas, as it is known for short, gave a commentary on the Five Articles of Remonstrance of 1610 that were the legacy of the theological views of Jacobus Arminius, who died in 1609.Rabbie, p. 8; Google Books. Background In arguing for a relaxation of orthodox Calvinism, or from another perspective against the hardening of Reformed theology along the lines proposed by his colleague and opponent Franciscus Gomarus, Arminius had appealed to the secular authorities. As a tactical move this appeal had brought advantages; but in the following years the Remonstrants, as the followers of Arminianism became called, had to face great resistance both to their views and to their approach to settling a dispute within the Dutch Reformed Church that was theological by recourse to the civil powers. Grotius held a prominent legal office, being Advocate General to the States of Holland and Zealand. In the period from the Hague Conference of 1611 between Remonstrants and their opponents the Contra- Remonstrants, the views of Grotius were not widely known. It was with the publication of the Ordinum Pietas that he came off the fence, and became identified with the Remonstrant cause.Guillaume Henri Marie Posthumus Meyjes, Meletius, sive, De iis quae inter Christianos conveniunt epistola (1988), pp.13–4; Google Books. The consequences on a personal level for the author were serious: six years later he was under a death sentence, after the religious conflict became a matter of high politics. Composition of the work Grotius visited England for two months in the spring of 1613, taken there by legal issues centred on Dutch and British trading in the East Indies. He moved in the highest circles, meeting both James I of England, and George Abbot the Archbishop of Canterbury.W. B. Patterson, King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (2000), pp. 144–5. He began the composition of the Ordinum Pietas after his return, making use of Calvinist theological reading which he had spent time on after the Conference. Particularly useful to the debate and relevant for citation were John Calvin, Pierre Du Moulin, David Paraeus, William Perkins, Johannes Piscator, and William Whitaker. In writing this book, Grotius was self-consciously taking a position in the affair of Conrad Vorstius. That was because it took aim at a work of Sibrandus Lubbertus from 1611, Commentarii ad nonaginta novem errores Conradi Vorstii from 1611, the year in which Vorstius, an Arminian, had been forced out of the University of Leiden. More particularly it was directed against the dedication Lubbertus had made to George Abbot, in which the States of Holland were criticised for their lenient handling of the Remonstrants, and their reluctance to call a synod.Rabbie, p. 37; Google Books. In reply to a polemic, he also used a rough, even insulting polemical tone of opponents; Grotius later felt he should have shown more restraint in the book.Grotius, p. 5; Google Books. Views Grotius argued for the tradition of Erasmus of seeking concord, putting down a marker for eirenicism; he also poured scorn on the idea, a frequent proposal of the time and in the event the solution taken, of a synod to decide on the theological points.Guillaume Henri Marie Posthumus Meyjes, Henk J. M. Nellen, Edwin Rabbie, Hugo Grotius, theologian: essays in honour of G. H. M. Posthumus Meyjes (1994), p. 84; Google Books. These ideas he developed by citing the Church Fathers; if not by name, Grotius uses the consensus patrum as a yardstick.Hans W. Blom, Property, Piracy and Punishment: Hugo Grotius on war and booty in De iure praedae: concepts and contexts (2009), pp. 130–2; Google Books. He brought up the third-century example of Firmilian, a saint, who had taken a soft line with Paul of Samosata, later adjudged a heretic (monarchianism). Grotius proposed an approach based on modestia (moderation), and a religious toleration not restricted to the holding of opinions privately (a restriction which had been cited in the debate from the Theodosian Code) given the existing tolerance in the Netherlands. He wanted to move the ground of the discussion from sharp definition of issues, onto the territory of procedure, and the coexistence of orthodoxy with other beliefs. In the second part of the work he argues from the early Protestant Reformation. Erasmus, who was indeed Dutch if a Catholic, had disagreed with Martin Luther on predestination, the most contentious issue in the debate. The Contra-Remonstrant view was an import, too. Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon had not completely agreed in their formulation of Protestant confessions; but orthodoxy could therefore allow co-existing views on predestination.Martin Mulsow, Jan Rohls, Socinianism and Arminianism: Antitrinitarians, Calvinists, and cultural exchange in seventeenth-century Europe (2005), p. 116; Google Books. Grotius argued, in the third part, for what came to be called Erastianism, giving the state power over church matters. The leading Remonstrant theologian Johannes Wtenbogaert had already done this in his Tractaet of 1610.Grotius, p. 13; Google Books. Grotius therefore gives arguments, for example that \\"human jurisprudence\\" and \\"divine jurisprudence\\" cannot be separated without loss. An example was close to hand in the recent history of the Flemish church, to support the disorder inherent in separate jurisdictions.Christoph A. Stumpf, The Grotian Theology of International Law: Hugo Grotius and the moral foundations of international relations, pp. 131–2; Google Books. Reception There were numerous hostile responses to the Ordinum Pietas, the first being the Ad Scripti...Hugonis Grotii (1614) of Johannes Bogermann. From the Remonstrant side it was answered by Caspar Barlaeus, Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus, and Gerard Vossius.Grotius, p. 128; Google Books. Lubbertus also replied in 1614, with his carefully considered Responsio ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii, from a team involving also Petrus Plancius, Festus Hommius and Matthew Slade.Willem Nijenhuis, Matthew Slade, 1569-1628: letters to the English ambassador (1986), p. 16; Google Books. Antonius Walaeus, a friendly Calvinist, had warned Grotius that his treatment of predestination would not be accepted by orthodox Calvinists; and so it proved, despite the reference to Johannes Anastasius Veluanus by way of pointing out the Dutch tradition of moderation on the topic.Rabbie, p. 10; Google Books. Jacques-August de Thou received a complimentary copy; but his reaction was to warn Grotius about the dangers of political involvement.Rhoda Schnur, Ann Moss, (editors), Acta Conventus Neo-Latini Hafniensis: proceedings of the Eighth International Congress of neo-Latin studies: Copenhagen, 12 August to 17 August 1991 (1994), p. 237; archive.org. Translations from the original Latin were into Dutch (Wtenbogaert)Wiep van Bunge, From Stevin to Spinoza: an essay on philosophy in the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic (2001), p. 23;Google Books. and into French, by Samuel Naeranus.Rabbie, p. 44; Google Books. A reprint was published (dated 1613 also) which toned down some of the criticisms of Lubbertus, but it was too late for Grotius to regain his reputation as a potential unifier of the Dutch church.Rabbie dbnl . Related works Grotius wrote extensively on related topics in the next years: these writings fall into three different classes: *Writings in an official capacity, as an employee of the States; *Publications on his own initiative; and *Manuscripts that were not published at the time. In the third category fall the Meletius, begun in 1611, and the De imperio summarum potestatum circa sacra, which was only published posthumously, in 1647.Grotius, p. 1; Google Books. The De imperio was completed about 1614, and then Grotius worked on a work against Socinianism, to clarify his opposition to Unitarian views. He sent it to Walaeus, an increasingly sceptical sounding board, and published it in 1617 as Defensio fidei Catholicae de satisfactione Christi adversus Faustus Socinum.Richard Tuck, Philosophy and Government 1572–1651 (1993), p. 190.

However, the concept of a person is difficult to define in a way that is universally accepted, due to its historical and cultural variability and the controversies surrounding its use in some contexts. =Western philosophy= In philosophy, the word \\"person\\" may refer to various concepts. According to the \\"naturalist\\" epistemological tradition, from Descartes through Locke and Hume, the term may designate any human (or non- human) agent who: (1) possesses continuous consciousness over time; and (2) who is therefore capable of framing representations about the world, formulating plans and acting on them.Charles Taylor, \\"The Concept of a Person\\", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114 According to Charles Taylor, the problem with the naturalist view is that it depends solely on a \\"performance criterion\\" to determine what is an agent. Thus, other things (e.g. machines or animals) that exhibit \\"similarly complex adaptive behaviour\\" could not be distinguished from persons. Instead, Taylor proposes a significance-based view of personhood: Others, such as American Philosopher Francis J. Beckwith, argue that personhood is not linked to function at all, but rather that it is the underlying personal unity of the individual. Philosopher J. P. Moreland clarifies this point: Harry G. Frankfurt writes that, in reference to a definition by Strawson, \\"What philosophers have lately come to accept as analysis of the concept of a person is not actually analysis of that concept at all.\\" He suggests that the concept of a person is intimately connected to free will, and describes the structure of human volition according to first- and second-order desires: P.G Ossorio, The Behavior Of Persons, Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013 According to Nikolas Kompridis, there might also be an intersubjective, or interpersonal, basis to personhood: Other philosophers have defined persons in different ways. Boethius gives the definition of \\"person\\" as \\"an individual substance of a rational nature\\" (\\"Naturæ rationalis individua substantia\\"). Mary Midgley defines a “person” as being a conscious, thinking being, which knows that it is a person (self- awareness).\\"Persons and non-persons\\", in Peter Singer (ed), In Defense of Animals. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52–62. Philosopher Thomas I. White argues that the criteria for a person are as follows: (1) is alive, (2) is aware, (3) feels positive and negative sensations, (4) has emotions, (5) has a sense of self, (6) controls its own behaviour, (7) recognises other persons and treats them appropriately, and (8) has a variety of sophisticated cognitive abilities. While many of White's criteria are somewhat anthropocentric, some animals such as dolphins would still be considered persons. Some animal rights groups have also championed recognition for animals as \\"persons\\".Fellow Champions Dolphins as “Non-Human Persons”, Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, January 10, 2010; Midgley, Mary. Another approach to personhood, Paradigm Case Formulation, used in Descriptive Psychology and developed by Peter Ossorio, involves the four interrelated concepts of 1) The Individual Person, 2) Deliberate Action, 3) Reality and the Real World, and 4) Language or Verbal Behavior. All four concepts require full articulation for any one of them to be fully intelligible. More specifically, a Person is an individual whose history is, paradigmatically, a history of Deliberate Action in a Dramaturgical pattern. Deliberate Action is a form of behavior in which a person (a) engages in an Intentional Action, (b) is cognizant of that, and (c) has chosen to do that. A person is not always engaged in a deliberate action but has the eligibility to do so. A human being is an individual who is both a person and a specimen of Homo sapiens. Since persons are deliberate actors, they also employ hedonic, prudent, aesthetic and ethical reasons when selecting, choosing or deciding on a course of action. As part of our \\"social contract\\" we expect that the typical person can make use of all four of these motivational perspectives. Individual persons will weigh these motives in a manner that reflects their personal characteristics. That life is lived in a “dramaturgical” pattern is to say that people make sense, that their lives have patterns of significance. The paradigm case allows for nonhuman persons, potential persons, nascent persons, manufactured persons, former persons, \\"deficit case\\" persons, and \\"primitive\\" persons. By using a paradigm case methodology, different observers can point to where they agree and where they disagree about whether an entity qualifies as a person.P. G. Ossorio, The Behavior of Persons, Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013Schwartz, Wynn. (1982) The Problem of Other Possible Persons: Dolphins, Primates, and Aliens. in, Advances in Descriptive Psychology, vol 2, (eds: Davis & Mitchel), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press =American law= A person is recognized by law as such, not because they are human, but because rights and duties are ascribed to them. The person is the legal subject or substance of which the rights and duties are attributes. An individual human being considered to be having such attributes is what lawyers call a \\"natural person.\\"Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 110. Gray, Nature and Sources of Law, ch. II. Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, p 1300 According to Black's Law Dictionary,Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, citing the National Labor Relations Act, section 2(1) a person is: In Federal law, the concept of legal personhood is formalized by statute (1 USC §8) to include \\"every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.\\" That statute also states that \\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being 'born alive' as defined in this section.\\" According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, many US States have their own definition of personhood which expands upon the federal definition of personhood, and Webster v. Reproductive Health Services declined to overturn the state of Missouri's law stating that As an application of social psychology and other disciplines, phenomena such as the perception and attribution of personhood have been scientifically studied. Typical questions addressed in social psychology are the accuracy of attribution, processes of perception and the formation of bias. Various other scientific/medical disciplines address the myriad of issues in the development of personality. Debates Various specific debates focus on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. =Humans= Beginning The beginning of human personhood is a concept long debated by religion and philosophy. With respect to abortion, 'personhood' is the status of a human being having individual human rights. The term was used by Justice Blackmun in Roe v. Wade. Personhood protest in front of the United States Supreme Court A political movement in the United States seeks to define the beginning of human personhood as starting from the moment of fertilization with the result being that abortion, as well as forms of birth control that act to deprive the human embryo of necessary sustenance in implantation, could become illegal. Supporters of the movement also state that it would have some effect on the practice of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), but would not lead to the practice being outlawed. Jonathan F. Will says that the personhood framework could produce significant restrictions on IVF to the extent that reproductive clinics find it impossible to provide the services.Will, Jonathan F. (2013) \\"Beyond Abortion: Why the personhood movement implicates reproductive choice\\". American Journal of Law and Medicine. (Boston: American Society of Law and Medicine) 39 (4): 601–602. Currently, the personhood movement is led by the Personhood Alliance, a coalition of state and national personhood organizations headquartered in Washington DC. The Personhood Alliance was founded in 2014 and currently has 22 affiliated organizations. A significant number of the state affiliates of the Personhood Alliance were once affiliates of National Right to Life. Organizations like Georgia Right to Life, Cleveland Right to Life, and Alaska Right to Life left National Right to Life and joined the Personhood Alliance after refusing to support National Right to Life's proposed legislation that included exceptions like the rape and incest exceptions. The Personhood Alliance describes itself as a \\"a Christ-centered, biblically informed organization dedicated to the non-violent advancement of the recognition and protection of the God-given, inalienable right to life of all human beings as legal persons, at every stage of their biological development and in every circumstance.\\" A precursor to the Personhood Alliance was Personhood USA, a Colorado-based umbrella group with a number of state-level affiliates, which describes itself as a nonprofit Christian ministry. and seeks to ban abortion. Personhood USA was co-founded by Cal Zastrow and Keith MasonPro-Life Profiles, Retrieved 2014-11-02. in 2008 following the Colorado for Equal Rights campaign to enact a state constitutional personhood amendment. Proponents of the movement regard personhood as an attempt to directly challenge the Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision, thus filling a legal void left by Justice Harry Blackmun in the majority opinion when he wrote: “If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant’s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.” Some medical organizations have described the potential effects of personhood legislation as potentially harmful to patients and the practice of medicine, particularly in the cases of ectopic and molar pregnancy. Susan Bordo has suggested that the focus on the issue of personhood in abortion debates has often been a means for depriving women of their rights. She writes that \\"the legal double standard concerning the bodily integrity of pregnant and nonpregnant bodies, the construction of women as fetal incubators, the bestowal of 'super-subject' status to the fetus, and the emergence of a father's-rights ideology\\" demonstrate \\"that the current terms of the abortion debate – as a contest between fetal claims to personhood and women's right to choose – are limited and misleading.\\"Susan Bordo, \\"Are Mothers Persons?\\", Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2003, 71–97. Others, such as Colleen Carroll Campbell, say that the personhood movement is a natural progression of society in protecting the equal rights of all members of the human species. She writes, “The basic philosophical premise behind these [personhood] amendments is eminently reasonable. And the alternative on offer – which severs humanity from personhood – is fraught with peril. If being human is not enough to entitle one to human rights, then the very concept of human rights loses meaning. And all of us — born and unborn, strong and weak, young and old — someday will find ourselves on the wrong end of that cruel measuring stick.\\" Father Frank Pavone agrees, adding, “Nor is this a dispute about the state imposing a religious or philosophical view. After all, your life and mine are not protected because of some religious or philosophical belief that others are required to have about us. More accurately, the law protects us precisely in spite of the beliefs of others who, in their own worldview, may not value our lives. …To support Roe vs. Wade is not merely to allow a medical procedure. It is to acknowledge that the government has the power to say who is a person and who is not. Who, then, is to limit the groups to whom it is applied? This is what makes “personhood” such an important public policy issue. The Vatican has recently been advancing a human exceptionalist understanding of personhood theory. Catechism 2270 reads: “Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.” =United States= In March 2007 Georgia became the first state in the nation to introduce a legislative resolution to amend the state constitution to define and recognize the personhood of the pre-born. The Georgia Catholic Conference and National Right to Life supported the effort and it failed to attract a super majority in both chambers in order to be placed on the ballot. Georgia legislators have filed a personhood resolution every session since 2007. In May 2008 Georgia Right to Life hosted the first nationwide Personhood Symposium targeting pro-life activists.http://www.joniandfriends.org/help-and-resources/other- resources/personhood/ This symposium was instrumental in spawning the group Personhood USA and the various state personhood efforts that followed. Voters in 46 Georgia counties approved personhood during the 2010 primary election with 75% in favor of a non-binding resolution declaring the equal rights of all human beings from conception. During the 2012 Republican primary a similar question was placed on the ballot statewide and passed with a super-majority (66%) of the vote in 158 of 159 counties. The summer of 2008 a citizen initiated amendment was proposed for the Colorado constitution. Three attempts to enact the from-fertilization definition of personhood into U.S. state constitutions via referenda have failed. Following two attempts to enact similar changes in Colorado in 2008 and 2010, a 2011 initiative to amend the state constitution by referendum in the state of Mississippi also failed to gain approval with around 58% of voters disapproving. In an interview after the referendum, Mason ascribed the failure of the initiative to a political campaign run by Planned Parenthood. Personhood proponents in Oklahoma sought to amend the state constitution to define personhood as beginning at conception. The state Supreme Court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ruled in April 2012 that the proposed amendment was unconstitutional under the federal Constitution and blocked inclusion of the referendum question on the ballot. In October 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the state Supreme Court's ruling. In 2006, a 16-year-old girl was charged in Mississippi with murder for the still-birth of her daughter on the basis that the girl had smoked cocaine while pregnant.ProPublica, 18 March 2014: A Stillborn Child, A Charge of Murder and the Disputed Case Law on ‘Fetal Harm’ These charges were later dismissed.The Dispatch, 3 April 2014: Judge dismisses Rennie Gibbs' depraved heart murder case =Ireland= In 1983, the people of Ireland added the Eighth Amendment to their constitution that “acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.” This was repealed in 2018 by the Thirty- sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. Women In the United States, the personhood of women has important legal consequences. Although in 1920 the 19th Amendment guaranteed women in the right to vote, it was not until 1971 that the US Supreme Court ruled in Reed v. ReedEqual Protection for Women that the law cannot discriminate between the sexes because the 14th amendment grants equal protection to all \\"persons.\\"Reed v. ReedTimeline of Personhood In 2011, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia disputed the conclusion of Reed v. Reed, arguing that women do not have equal protection under the 14th amendment as \\"persons\\"Scalia: Women Don't Have Constitutional Protection Against DiscriminationTime because the Constitution's use of the gender-neutral term \\"Person\\" means that the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex, but also does not prohibit such discrimination, adding \\"Nobody ever thought that that's what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that.\\"Let's Put It in Writing: Women Are Equal Many others, including law professor Jack Balkin disagree with this assertion. Balkin states that, at a minimum \\"the fourteenth amendment was intended to prohibit some forms of sex discrimination-- discrimination in basic civil rights against single women.\\" Many local marriage laws at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified (as well as when the original Constitution was ratified) had concepts of coverture and \\"head-and-master\\", which meant that women legally lost rights upon marriage, including rights to ownership of property and other rights of adult participation in the political economy; single women retained these rights, however, and voted in some jurisdictions. Other commentators have noted that some of the ratifiers of the US Constitution (in 1787) also, in contemporaneous contexts, ratified state level Constitutions that saw women as Persons and required them to be treated as such, including granting women rights such as the right to vote. Professor Jane Calvert argues that the 17th and 18th Century Quaker concept of Personhood applied to women, and the prevalence of Quakers in the population of several colonies, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, at the time that the original Constitution was drafted and ratified likely influenced the choice of the term \\"Person\\" for the Constitution instead of the term \\"Man,\\" which was used in the Declaration of Independence and in the contemporaneously drafted French Constitution of 1791. The personhood of women also has consequences for the ethics of abortion. For example, in A Defense of Abortion, Judith Jarvis Thomson argues that one person's right to bodily autonomy trumps another's right to life, and therefore abortion does not violate a fetus's right to life: Instead abortion should be understood as the pregnant women withdrawing her own body from use, which causes the fetus to die. Questions pertaining to the personhood of women and the personhood of fetuses have legal and ethical consequences for reproductive rights beyond abortion as well. For example, some fetal homicide laws have resulted in jail time for women suspected of drug use during a pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage, like one Alabama woman who was sentenced to ten years. Slaves Am I not a man emblem used during the campaign to abolish slavery In 1772, Somersett's Case determined that slavery was unsupported by law in England and Wales, but not elsewhere in the British Empire. In 1868, under the 14th Amendment, black men in the United States became citizens. In 1870, under the 15th Amendment, black men got the right to vote. In 1853, Sojourner Truth became famous for asking Ain't I a Woman? and after slavery was abolished, black men continued to fight for personhood by claiming, I Am A Man! Children The legal definition of persons may include or exclude children depending on the context. In the US, regarding liability, children or minors are not legally persons because they do not satisfy the requirements for personhood under the law. However, regarding protection under the law, the US Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 provides a legal structure that those born at any gestational stage that are either breathing, have heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or any voluntary muscle movement are living, individual human persons. Disability Adults with cognitive disabilities are regularly denied rights generally granted to all adult persons such as the right to marry and consent to sex,Wang, Violet. “The Right to Sexuality.” The Atlantic, Atlantic Media Company, 4 June 2019, [www.theatlantic.com/video/index/591280/disability-consent/]. and the right to vote. In many countries, including the US, psychiatric illness can be cited to imprison an adult without due process. =Non-human animals= Some philosophers and those involved in animal welfare, ethology, the rights of animals, and related subjects, consider that certain animals should also be considered to be persons and thus granted legal personhood. Commonly named species in this context include the great apes, cetaceans, parrots, corvids, and elephants, because of their apparent intelligence and intricate social rules. The idea of extending personhood to all animals has the support of legal scholars such as Alan Dershowitz and and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, and animal law courses are (as of 2008) taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the United States. On May 9, 2008, Columbia University Press published Animals as Persons: Essays on the Abolition of Animal Exploitation by Professor Gary L. Francione of Rutgers University School of Law, a collection of writings that summarizes his work to date and makes the case for non-human animals as persons. Those who oppose personhood for non-human animals are known as human exceptionalists or human supremacists, and more pejoratively speciesists.Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason By Val Plumwood Other theorists attempt to demarcate between degrees of personhood. For example, Peter Singer's two-tiered account distinguishes between basic sentience and the higher standard of self-consciousness which constitutes personhood. Wynn Schwartz has offered a Paradigm Case Formulation of Persons as a format allowing judges to identify qualities of personhood in different entities. Julian Friedland has advanced a seven-tiered account based on cognitive capacity and linguistic mastery. Amanda Stoel suggested that rights should be granted based on a scale of degrees of personhood, allowing entities currently denied any right to be recognized some rights, but not as many. In 1992, Switzerland amended its constitution to recognize animals as beings and not things. A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first European Union member to do so. The New Zealand parliament included restrictions on the use of 'non- human hominids' in research or teaching when passing the Animal Welfare Act (1999). In 2007, the parliament of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous province of Spain, passed the world's first legislation granting legal rights to all great apes. In 2013, India's Ministry of Forests and Environment banned the importation or capture of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) for entertainment, exhibition, or interaction purposes, on the basis that \\"cetaceans in general are highly intelligent and sensitive\\" and that it \\"is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment.\\" It noted that \\"various scientists\\" have argued they should be seen as \\"non-human persons\\" with commensurate rights, but did not take an official position on this, and indeed did not have the legal authority to do so. In 2014, a hybrid, zoo-born orangutan named Sandra was termed by the court in Argentina as a \\"non-human subject\\" in an unsuccessful habeas corpus case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The status of the orangutan as a \\"non-human subject\\" needs to be clarified by the court. Court cases relevant to this orangutan are continuing in 2015.For corporations, see \\"Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit\\", Reuters, December 21, 2014. Finally, in 2019, Sandra was granted nonhuman personhood and freed from captivity to a Florida sanctuary. In 2015, for the first time, two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, were thought to be \\"legal persons,\\" having been granted a writ of habeas corpus. This meant their detainer, Stony Brook University, had to provide a legally sufficient reason for their imprisonment. This view was rejected and the writ was reversed by the officiating judge shortly thereafter. =Hypothetical beings= Speculatively, there are several other likely categories of beings where personhood is at issue. Aliens If alien life were found to exist, under what circumstances would they be counted as \\"persons\\"? Do we have to consider any \\"willing and communicative (capable to register its own will) autonomous body\\" in the universe, no matter the species, an individual (a person)? Do they deserve equal rights with the human race? Artificial intelligence or life If artificial intelligences, intelligent and self-aware system of hardware and software, are eventually created, what criteria would determine their personhood? Likewise, at what point would human-created biological life achieve personhood? Modified humans The theoretical landscape of personhood theory has been altered recently by controversy in the bioethics community concerning an emerging community of scholars, researchers, and activists identifying with an explicitly transhumanist position, which supports morphological freedom, even if a person changed so much as to no longer be considered a member of the human species. For example, how much of a human can be artificially replaced before one loses their personhood? If people are considered persons because of their brain, then what if the brain's thought patterns, memories and other attributes could be transposed into a device? Would the patient still be considered a person after the operation? =Corporations= Today, in statutory and corporate law, certain social constructs are legally considered persons. In many jurisdictions, some corporations and other legal entities are considered legal persons with standing to sue or be sued in court. This is known as legal or corporate personhood. In 1819, the US Supreme Court ruled in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, that corporations have the same rights as natural persons to enforce contracts. =Environmental entities= Bolivia In 2006, Bolivia passed a law recognizing the rights of nature \\"to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities\\". Ecuador In 2008, Ecuador approved a constitution to recognize that nature \\"...has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution.\\" New Zealand The Whanganui River of New Zealand is revered by the local Māori people as Te Awa Tupua, sometimes translated as \\"an integrated, living whole\\". Efforts to grant it special legal protection have been pursued by the Whanganui iwi since the 1870s. In 2012, an agreement to grant legal personhood to the river was signed between the New Zealand government and the Whanganui River Māori Trust. One guardian from the Crown and one from the Whanganui are responsible for protecting the river. India In 2017, court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand recognized the Ganges and Yamuna as legal persons. The judges cited Whanganui river in New Zealand as precedent for the action. Religion In animistic religion, animals, plants, and other entities may be persons or deities. In China's religious philosophy of Taoism, the Tao is a path of life and a divine field; not exhibiting personhood of itself, but \\"if well-nourished\\", is supposedly beneficial towards persons and the components of personhood. These sorts of indirect relationships between various religious notions and personhood are often not well-examined philosophically; for example, many generally non-religious Japanese people maintain a degree of Shinto spirituality (thus avoiding fully declared non- spirituality) because the kami are not as central to the Shinto religion as a monotheistic Creator God, thus having an indirect impact on the formation of a mortal individual's personality. The non-centrality of the kami allow an individual to take an ambivalent stance towards atheism or theism and deism. Religiously speaking, the degree of personhood granted to a deity (along with their universal centrality to a given religion) may be seen to have an impact on the world view and understandings of personhood by mortal individuals. =Christianity= Christianity is the first philosophical system to use the word \\"person\\" in its modern sense.Met. John Zizioulas, Being As Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church. Crestwood: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1997, pp. 27–49 The word \\"persona\\" was transformed from its theater use into a term with strict technical theological meaning by Tertullian in his work, Adversus Praxean (\\"Against Praxeas\\"), in order to distinguish the three \\"persons\\" of the Trinity. Subsequently, Boethius refined the word to mean \\"an individual substance of a rational nature.\\" This can be re-stated as \\"that which possesses an intellect and a will.\\" Thus, the word \\"person\\" was originally a theological term created and defined by Christians to explain Christian theological concepts.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 7, 2011. In the episode, half-demon Callie Maggotbone repeatedly refuses to go through with her arranged marriage to Twayne Boneraper. To convince her father she is serious with her boyfriend Mark Lilly, she asks him to move in with her. Following a therapy session held by Mark, Callie's divorced parents get back together and produce a second daughter, Lilith, who will replace Callie as Twayne's bride. Callie and Mark later take on the job to raise Lilith, who develops evil plans for the wedding. The episode was written by Mick Kelly and directed by Richard Ferguson-Hull and series creator Devin Clark. The episode features guest performances by recurring voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" includes a homage to the horror film The Omen, along with other minor allusions to Rosemary's Baby and The Shining. Critical responses to the episode were positive; critics called it solid and memorable and praised its humor as well as the character development of Callie. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 980,000 viewers in its original airing in the United States, which was deemed steady compared to the season premiere, \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\". Plot Half-demon Callie Maggotbone's demon father Aldermach is pressuring her to break up with her boyfriend Mark Lilly and marry Twayne Boneraper, to fulfill an ancient magical blood pact; Aldermach gets paid by Twayne's family to deliver him a bride, and if he does not, he will get murdered. Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him to break up with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together. The next day, Rosie and Aldermach announce that they have given birth to Callie's sister, Lilith. Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie take on the task to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore. Production and cultural references Series creator Devin Clark co-directed the episode. \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" was written by Mick Kelly, in his second writing credit for the series, following the first season finale \\"The Manbirds\\". The episode was directed by series creator Devin Clark and Richard Ferguson-Hull. \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" marked Ferguson-Hull's first directing credit for the series; he previously served as a director for the Adult Swim animated series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (2000–07). In addition to the main cast, \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. Klausner provided the voices of Lilith and Rosie, and main cast member Larry Murphy returned to voice Callie's father Aldermach. \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" was first hinted at in June 2011 during an interview by Clark on what to expect in the series' second season, where he revealed the episode's main plot and its references: \\"Callie's parents get back together in one episode and give birth to a sister for Callie who because of being a supernatural creature, ends up aging one year, every day, and we have an homage to The Omen in there. Mark and Callie end up taking over the responsibilities of her parenting dealing with this demonic child.\\" The story of Mark and Callie taking care of Callie's sister Lilith, who eventually matures into an eviler version of Callie, pays homage to the horror film The Omen (1976). The homage to The Omen also includes elements of another horror film, Rosemary's Baby (1968). Lilith's \\"creepy\\" and demonic characteristics as a child drew comparisons towards the film The Shining (1980), and the episode's title mimics the comedy-drama film Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). The review website Yelp is mentioned when Mark tells his clients to leave him a favorable review at the site. Reception The episode originally aired in the United States on Comedy Central on July 7, 2011, following the Futurama episode \\"Law and Oracle\\". According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" was watched by 980,000 viewers, compared to the 1.55 million who watched Futurama. The episode also acquired a 0.5 rating in the 18–49 demographic, which TV by the Numbers writer Robert Seidman noted was \\"steady\\" compared to the rating for the previous episode, \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\". However, the episode marked a slight downfall in total viewership, as the season premiere drew an audience of 1.14 million. \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" was met with positive reviews from television critics. MTV writer Charles Webb referred it to as \\"really solid\\" and \\"more character-focused\\" than the season premiere. He commented that \\"[the episode] leads to a marked improvement in the humor, which simply flows from scene to scene.\\" Webb also praised that the series' writers allow Callie to develop her character, stating: \\"While we don't exactly get any great new insights about the character [...] it's still cool that the writers are allowing her to develop a little given their non- continuity driven focus.\\" Webb particularly praised the episode's montage scene and the continuing \\"top-notch\\" animation style. Josh Harrison of entertainment website Ology rated the episode 8 out of 10 and wrote that \\"[it] was one to remember\\". Harrison noted that the writers appear to explore the characters' backgrounds during the second season, like how Leonard's background was in focus in \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\". Harrison concluded his review while commenting on \\"Callie and Her Sister\\": \\"This sort of episode is still in its early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it means we get to better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world. Good stuff, I say, and I'd like to see more of it.\\" References External links * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Ugly Americans (TV series) episodes ","title":"Callie and Her Sister"},{"id":"33690520","text":"Lucy Tejada Saenz (October 9, 1920 in Pereira, Colombia – November 2, 2011 in Cali, Colombia) was a Colombian contemporary painter.

He began his university years studying law, but transferred to philosophy in hopes of broader intellectual engagements. In 1931, Berkes graduated from the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Literature of Istanbul University. He struggled to find a professorship immediately after graduating as he lacked patronage in universities and the Ministry of Education. Recommended by a friend, he applied to a position at the People's House in Ankara. There he was exposed to the ideology of Kemalism, which at the time, allowed for much intellectual debate regarding the construction of a new Turkey. In 1935, he then became an assistant at the same faculty. In the same year, he had gone to United States and he had studied sociology at the University of Chicago until 1939.

In other cases, local residents lobbying against a new development might use circulation plans to justify the denial of a development's building permit, citing decreased quality due to overcrowding, noise pollution, traffic, and so on. Good city planners do their best to use main thoroughfares and so on to draw commuter traffic out of local neighborhoods (where excessive traffic is seen by local voters as undesirable) and onto larger roads, which often utilize considerable buffers like setback land and vegetation to divorce non-local (commuter) traffic from local (neighborhood) traffic.

He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and practised architecture in Scotland and London before emigrating to Montreal, Quebec, in 1883, where he designed many of the buildings of McGill University. He retired from architecture in 1904 and returned to London, where he served on London County Council from 1908 to 1926. He was knighted for his political services in 1926. Biography Taylor was the son of James Taylor, a publisher, and Agnes Drummond, the sister of Sir George Drummond, of Montreal. In 1864 he began his architectural training as an articled apprentice to Pilkington & Bell in Edinburgh, staying for five years. He worked for a year as architect in the Duke of Roxburghe's estate office, and then moved to Aberdeen where he worked in the office of William Smith. =Architectural practice in London= He left Scotland for London in 1872, taking a position at the office of Joseph Clarke, and studying at the Royal Academy Schools and University College London. His essay on London's 16th- century architecture won a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) silver medal in 1874. In 1877 he travelled to Italy and France. He joined the RIBA in 1878. An essay on the work of Sir Christopher Wren gained him a second RIBA medal in 1881. He subsequently published a book on the subject: The Towers and Steeples designed by Sir Christopher Wren, a descriptive, historical and critical essay. In 1879 he established his own architectural practice in London, with a design for a Memorial Hall and Schools at Dover being his first commission (completed 1881, since demolished). Together with Henry Hall, another of Pilkington's former pupils, Taylor entered the competition to design Glasgow City Chambers, being placed second. In 1882 Taylor established a partnership with George William Hamilton Gordon. =Montreal= In 1883, Taylor and Gordon opened an office in Montreal, where Taylor's uncle George Drummond was an influential figure. Taylor moved to Canada, while Gordon stayed in London. However, the partnership was dissolved in 1888. In Canada, Taylor worked with the architect R.W.G. Bousfield. Taylor was responsible for buildings on the campus of McGill University including the School of Architecture's Macdonald-Harrington Building (1896), Macdonald Physics Building (1893), the Redpath Library (1893), the Macdonald Engineering Building (1907), and the Memorial Arch for King George V (1901). He designed the Montreal Diocesan Theological College building on University Street near Milton Street (1895–96), which is also now part of McGill University. When Ravenscrag, now the Allan Memorial Institute, was still the residence of Sir Hugh Allan, Taylor extended the east wing (1889), and enlarged the stables (1898). Taylor performed alterations and restoration on the Christ Church Cathedral from 1890–91, and installed a memorial window for Mrs. A.C. Hooper, 1902–03. He designed the Mount Royal Crematory (1901), the first crematory in Canada, on the eastern side of the Mount Royal Cemetery. In 1885, he designed and built Francis Redpath's house in Montreal, which from 1986 was under threat of demolition from the Sochaczevski family until final demolition in 2014 (refer to the relevant paragraph within the Golden Square Mile). He was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Taylor was the architect responsible for the buildings and renovation of several buildings for the Bank of Montreal: * The Bank of Montreal in Waterloo, Ontario, formerly known as the Molson's Bank, (1914) * The Bank of Montreal in Point St. Charles Branch, Wellington Street at Magdalen Street, Montreal, Quebec (1901) * The Bank of Montreal in West End, Ste.

He pursued a political career as a Conservative Party municipal councillor. He was elected to London County Council on 24 October 1908, representing Hampstead, and served until 1926. From 1911 to 1937 he also served as Chair of the Architectural Education Committee and Chair of the Slade Committee at University College London. In 1926 he was knighted for his political work. =Legacy= Under his will, the Sir Andrew Taylor Prize in Fine Art and the Sir Andrew Taylor Prize in Architecture were founded at University College London.

Situated on the eastern seaboard of Jeju Island and said to resemble a gigantic ancient castle, this tuff cone is 182 meters high, has a preserved bowl-like crater and also displays diverse inner structures resulting from the sea cliff. These features are considered to be of geologic worth, providing information on eruptive and depositional processes of hydromagmatic volcanoes worldwide as well as past volcanic activity of Seongsan Ilchulbong itself. Geological characteristics Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone was formed by Surtseyan-type hydrovolcanic activity upon a shallow seabed about 5,000 years ago when the sea level was same as the present (Sohn & Chough, 1992; Sohn et al., 2002). Most volcanic cones or oreums (Jeju dialect for volcanic cones) were formed by piles of scoria cones which are created by Hawaiian eruptions or Strombolian eruptions. But Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and a few other oreums on Jeju Island were hydromagmatic volcanoes which were made by piles of volcanic ash, the interaction of hot ascending magma and seawater or ground water. Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone is 180 meters high, and its crater is about 600 meters in diameter. It has a dip of strata up to 45 degrees and is 90 meters from sea level to the crater floor. Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone erupted in very moist and sticky conditions allowing a lot of water to permeate into the volcanic vent, making the diverse depositional features of a wet eruption. The wet hydrovolcanic activity continued until the end of the eruption. Consequently, the tuff has a bowl-like crater unfilled by scoria or lava. Except for the northwestern park, the Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone forms a steep cliff because of the resultant wave following its eruptions. Through these eruptions, Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone shows a perfect cross section from the intracrater strata to the marginal strata. Its diverse geological structures are considered to have great geological importance because they may be used to interpret not only the past volcanic activity of the Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone but also eruptive and depositional processes of hydromagmatic volcanoes worldwide. There are numerous hydromagmatic volcanoes similar to the Seongsan Ilchulbong, but there are no other known hydromagmatic volcanoes with a well-preserved tuff cone and diverse internal structures along a sea cliff. Because of these scientific values and remarkable scenery, Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone was able to be designated as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and it is worth preserving permanently as a natural heritage of humankind. Natural ecosystem The Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone's flora is composed of 222 taxa. There are 6 rare plant species: a fern, Crypsinus hastatus, an orchid, Neofinetia falcata, two parasitic plants, Aeginetia indica and Orobanche coerulescens, and two other herbaceous plants, Arisaema heterophyllum and Glehnia littoralis. Aeginetia indica in particular is considered an important plant in terms of plant distribution, because in Korea it can be found only in Jeju Island, in the crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. There are additionally 300 species of marine algae on the Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. Diverse new species were found in this area including Dasyiphonia chejuensis.  Climbing  It takes usually one hour to climb to the top and to go down, using stairs, for an admission fee. The area is open from 7:10 am to 7 pm in summer and 7:30 am to 6 pm in winter. There is also a luggage storage room before the entrance.

Artemisia norvegica is a perennial subshrub growing tall with erect stems growing from a caudex and taproot. Most of the leaves are located low on the stems and are long. The nodding inflorescence bears flower heads containing ray and disc florets. The ray florets are female with no functioning male parts and the disc florets at the center are bisexual. The plant reproduces by seed and may spread vegetatively by sending out stolons. The seeds are dispersed on the wind. Artemisia norvegica grows in subalpine and alpine climates and in Arctic habitat such as tundra. It can be found in moraines, fell field habitat, alpine meadows, and areas dominated by grasses and sedges. In Alaska it occurs on the fjords of Prince William Sound alongside larkspur monkshood (Aconitum delphiniifolium), Eschscholtz's buttercup (Ranunculus eschscholtzii), and Canadian burnet (Sanguisorba canadensis). It grows on Alaskan mountains such as the Kenai Mountains with grasses, sedges, and willows. In the alpine tundra of the Rocky Mountains it grows in snowbeds and on turf made up of blackroot sedge (Carex elynoides) and alpine clover (Trifolium dasyphyllum). It occurs in the mountains of the Northwest Territories among lichens and grasses such as arctic bluegrass (Poa arctica). Artemisia norvegica is food for a number of animals, such as mountain goats, which eat it during the summer in Alaska, as well as Sitka black-tailed deer and hoary marmots. Artemisia norvegica is a pioneer species in the primary phase of ecological succession in disturbed areas, such as plains scoured by flooding. It has been known to colonize denuded soil in vehicle tracks. It was used to revegetate habitat disturbed during the construction of the Trail Ridge Road in Colorado. ;Subspecies * Artemisia norvegica subsp. norvegica * Artemisia norvegica subsp. saxatilis (Besser) H.M.Hall & Clem.

Varieties of tulum, center \\"Otlu tulum peyniri\\", or Tulum with herbs, in Ankara Tulum cheese () is a traditional Turkish goat's milk cheese ripened in a goatskin casing, called tulum in Turkish. Due to its unique flavor, it is preferred as meze to rakı in Turkey. Cheesemaking =Conventional= Tulum cheese is made by heating high-fat goat's milk to a temperature of and subsequently souring it through addition a starter culture. The milk then starts to coagulate. After about an hour, the milk is entirely converted into curds and whey. The curd is drained and repeatedly cut by special knives into smaller cubes allowing the whey to drain. The temperature is kept constant throughout this process. The curds are collected in hemp cheesecloth, which have been cleaned, cooled and wetted before use. The bundles of curd are then hung for eight hours to allow them to drain and cure. The curds in the cheesecloth are then pressed into a form with a wooden cover. A weight is placed on the cover for several hours allowing more whey to be expressed. The curd is subsequently cut in pieces the size of bar of soap and immersed in brine. The pieces are then arranged on a counter, and cured for 24 hours. The next day, the curds are crushed by hand, kneaded with raw goat's milk and then tightly stuffed into a goatskin casing, which has been cleaned and salted. The curd filling is topped with salt, and the casing's opening is fastened with a cord. The goatskin casing is stored in a cool place such as a cave or cellar at temperatures of for about six months to ripen. The casing may be perforated at its sides to allow any residual whey to drain. =Commercial= Contrary to homemade cheese, commercial tulum is made of goat's milk with a lower fat content, and kneaded with water buffalo or sheep milk, ripened in cowskin casings, and produced in an accelerated process that makes it, however, less durable. Its flavor is slightly different and it may become moldy. Ripening of commercially produced tulum is commonly also carried out in plastic barrels. Tulum cheese by location Tulum cheese is differentiated in Turkey by location. Cheese originating from different parts of the country differs in taste due to variation in production techniques. The most notable tulum cheeses are: ;Tulum cheese of Erzincan: Made in Erzincan Province in Eastern Anatolia Region. ;Tulum cheese of Izmir: The tulum cheese of Izmir differs from other regional tulum cheese varieties in processing and characteristic. Produced in Aegean Region provinces like İzmir, Aydın, Manisa, Muğla and Balıkesir, it is made of raw milk heated to , and cooled immediately down to acidifying temperature. Curds are brined in 16-percentage solution and cured for one night. The curd is filled then in cans with 12-percentage solution of brine for ripening. ;Tulum cheese of Divle Divle is a village in the Ayrancı district of Karaman Province in Central Anatolia Region. ;Tulum cheese of Çimi: Çimi is a village in the Akseki district of Antalya Province in Mediterranean Region. ;Tulum chese of Kargı: Produced in Kargı of Çorum province in Black Sea Region, this variety comes closest to conventional tulum cheese. The annual production of 25 tons is mostly consumed in Çorum and its neighbouring provinces Kastamonu, Samsun and Ankara.

Earlier confusion about the location of the original DeGive's stems from two misunderstandings. First, the location was assumed to be the site of the Kimball opera house. However, this building was at the SW corner of Marietta and Forsyth; DeGive's was at the NE corner. \\"Map of Atlanta\\" (1886) Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Georgia Libraries.

In 1893, DeGive opened the new, larger DeGive's Grand Opera House, which would later become Loew's Grand Theatre, at Peachtree and Forsyth. Earlier opera house DeGive's was not the first opera house in Atlanta. The first shows performed in Atlanta predate the American Civil War and were primarily performed in makeshift facilities modified for the operatic arts. Reconstruction saw the formation of the Atlanta Opera House and Building Association. The association obtained the southwest corner of Marietta Street and Forsythe Street to construct a five- story opera house. By 1868, they were out of money. Instead of hosting great performances, Atlanta's first opera house, the Kimball Opera House as it was later known, was sold at a loss. It served as Georgia's state capitol from January 1869 to July 1889.

Arachana was first named by Graciela Piñeiro, Alejandro Ramos and Claudia Marsicano in 2012 and the type species is A. nigra. It shares characteristics with both rhinesuchids and lydekkerinids, making it a transitional form between basal and more advanced stereospondyls. Description Arachana is known from the holotype FC-DPV 1369, a three-dimensionally preserved nearly complete skull that has not been distorted. It was collected in the Colonia Orozco locality from the Buena Vista Formation of the Norte Basin. The formation spans the boundary between the Permian and the Triassic, and it is uncertain whether FC- DPV 1369 was found in rocks above or below the boundary. Arachana shares several characters with rhinesuchids. For example, it has a large head with orbits or eye sockets placed slightly behind the mid-length of the skull. The surface of the skull is deeply pitted and the margins of the cheek regions are smooth and convex. The basioccipital bone at the back of the skull is small. On the palate, the pterygoid bone is connected to the vomer by a projection called the palatal ramus. The ramus separates the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the palate. In many temnospondyls, the palatine and ectopterygoid bones also touch the vacuities, but in Arachana and rhinesuchids, the palatine ramus excludes these bones from the vacuity margins. Arachana also has characteristics of a more derived group of stereospondyls called lydekkerinids. In both Arachana and lydekkerinids, the otic notch in the back of the skull is shallow and is not touched by the supratemporal bone as is otherwise the case in temnospondyls. Sensory sulci, grooves in the skull that held a lateral line system in life, run across the lacrimal bone but are not angled sharply as in other temnospondyls. On the palates of both Arachana and lydekkerinids, rows of palatine teeth are relatively small and the main body of the pterygoid bone is covered in small projections. None of these features are present in rhinesuchids, suggesting that Arachana was a transitional form between basal stereospondyls like rhinesuchids and more advanced forms like lydekkerinids. The transitional features of Arachana place it as part of an entire transitional fauna that existed around the Permo-Triassic boundary. While it is uncertain whether Arachana lived before or after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, its transitional position shows that some temnospondyls were diversifying rather than diminishing across the boundary.

Device Classification: Sun Protective Clothing: 510(K) K920240. FDA Consumer and by Health Canada. No sun protective clothing had previously been reviewed as a medical device in the U.S. or Canada.FDA Consumer Jul-Aug 1995; Thwarting skin cancer with sun sense – includes related articles on ultraviolet radiation, artificial sunlight, and ultraviolet exposure http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n6_v29/ai_17280008/pg_2/ Solumbra offered improved and superior ultraviolet (UV) protection when compared to a conventional 30 SPF sunscreen and typical summer clothing. Solumbra sun protective clothing is now rated at 100+ SPF. History Solumbra was developed by Shaun Hughes, who was diagnosed and treated for malignant melanoma at age 26 during a visit to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He felt that traditional UV protection was not sufficient: he would tan through his sunscreen and sunburn through his summer clothing. Based upon medical research and involvement of UV and medical experts, Hughes developed the Solumbra line of fabric and clothing. The Solumbra logo is a depiction of the sun’s rays eclipsed by effective sun protection that, in turn, provides an area of safe shade. Solumbra entered the U.S. marketplace in 1992. Technology The main goal of Solumbra fabrics is to prevent UV from transmitting through the garment's fibers and apertures (holes between the fibers). Hughes developed the technology without treatments or coatings that could lose their effectiveness and photoprotection after use, laundering, and exposure to environmental factors. Solumbra clothing designs are based upon published medical guidelines.Keeling JH, Kraus EW, Pathak M, Sober AJ. Hats: design and protection from ultraviolet radiation. Mil Med, 1989 May;154(5):250-5. Designs are typically long sleeved, long legged, or wide brimmed, in order to cover the maximum skin area. Research Sun protection clothing can offer superior photoprotection because of some common problems with sunscreen: misapplication, low durability, poor reapplication behavior, and poor cosmetic elegance. R Sayre was the lead researcher of in vitro SPF testing for regular summer fabrics. This revealed that traditional summer clothing in North America offered less than 15 SPF protection, the minimum level recommended by doctors. These regular summer fabrics tested between SPF 59 when dry and SPF 39 when wet.Sayre RM, Hughes SNG. Sun Protective Apparel: advancements in sun protection, Skin Cancer Journal, 1993, 8:41-47. Nicholas Lowe and R Sayre followed this up with in vivo research.Lowe NJ, Bourget T, Hughes S, Sayre RM.

In vivo research spearheaded by J Menter and Sayre, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, showed that most mice contracted squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) skin cancers through typical summer fabrics, and mice protected by Solumbra fabrics did not incur skin cancers.Menter JM, Hollins TD, Sayre RM, Etemadi AA, Willis I, Hughes SNG. Protection against UV photocarcinegensis by fabric materials, J Am Acad Dermatology 1994; 31:711-716. Subsequent research by Menter and Sayre found that specific Solumbra fabrics provided photoprotection for mice against injury from visible light when sensitized with the photosensitizer, ALA, compared to insufficient protection by typical summer fabric.Menter JM, Hollins TD, Sayre RM, Etemadi AA, Willis I, Hughes SNG. Protection against photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced photosensitivity by fabric material, Photoderm Photoimmunol Photomed 1998; 4:154-159.

Biography Guetzloe is a community activist who heads Ax the Tax, an anti-tax group in Florida, and a radio talk show host heard exclusively on the Phoenix Network, an internet radio station which he owns. His activities involve political and civic affairs in Central Florida as well as state and national issues. A graduate of Florida State University, Guetzloe served as the university's student body president (his student body vice president was former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist). Following graduation Guetzloe moved to Orlando, Florida to accept a position as public relations director for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association. Two years later, he was appointed the regional director for the Florida Medical Association where he handled public relations, lobbying and political matters in a 17-county area of Florida. Guetzloe founded Ax the Tax in 1982 and shortly thereafter established a public relations and marketing company called Advantage Consultants. He contends his leadership as chair of Ax the Tax has led to 17 successful anti-tax battles. His successes have ranged from defeating the 2003 Mobility 20/20 sales tax increase for transportationOrlando Sentinel. http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-10-15/news/GUETZLOEPROFILE_1_ax-the- tax-student-groups-orlando to being described as \\"a knight in shining armor charging in on his white horse\\" by a city commissioner for successfully saving a historic trailer park in Winter Garden, Florida. Florida Taxpayers Union Guetzloe helped found the Florida Taxpayers Union in 2004 as an affiliate of the National Taxpayers Union, a grassroots organization working for lower taxes, smaller government and accountability from public officials. The Florida group maintains it has more than 140,000 members, supporters and contributors throughout the state. The issues the Florida Taxpayers Union focuses on include high taxes that undermine private market competition, state regulatory burdens, wasteful government spending and lawsuit abuse. The group also promotes more access to school choice for parents, private property rights, a taxpayer bill of rights to restrain the growth of government and increased domestic oil and gas production for energy needs. Ax the Tax Rally Campaign Flyer and First Amendment In 2006, Guetzloe was charged with 14 misdemeanors for distributing a political campaign mailer that did not identify who paid for the flyer.

He also cited the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (McIntyre vs. Ohio Elections Commission),US Supreme Court Center. http://supreme.justia.com/us/514/334/case.html which stated that prohibition of the distribution of anonymous campaign literature abridges free speech in violation of the First Amendment. In 2009, Guetzloe helped his longtime attorney Fred O’Neal found the Florida TEA Party,Politico. http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1109/A_Tea_Party_party_arrives_in_Florida.html a registered political party in Florida, and created a firestorm of controversy resulting in lawsuits against O’Neal, Guetzloe and the Florida TEA Party. All lawsuits were settled in favor of O’Neal, Guetzloe and the fledgling Florida TEA Party. O'Neal said the Florida TEA Party may have helped Florida Governor Rick Scott win a close race with Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum in the 2010 Republican Primary for Governor, citing e-mails sent to 100,000 Floridians in the final hours of the primary. The Guetzloe Report In 2010, Guetzloe formed The Phoenix Network and placed his long- running radio show on the network. The Guetzloe Report, which began broadcasting daily in January 1997, receives an average of 12,000 listeners a day with some shows reaching more than 50,000 listeners. In February 2011, Guetzloe and the Phoenix Network were invited to broadcast live from the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum at the Centennial Celebration of Ronald Reagan’s birthday. In 2011, Guetzloe was designated Republican presidential campaign commentator on The Voice of Russia, the Russian government's international radio service. Guetzloe’s work as a radio commentator, political consultant and anti-tax activist “makes him unique among political figures in Florida,” according to the Orlando Sentinel. “Regular targets range from the mayors of Orlando and Orange County to the Orlando Sentinel to other lobbyists he considers enemies.” Doug Guetzloe arriving at court. In 2012, Guetzloe was found guilty of two misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file tax returns. The two counts arose from Guetzloe's failure to file tax returns for 2005 and 2006. Guetzloe accrued over $180,000 in income during each of the years he failed to file returns. At the trial Guetzloe was represented by a public defender. Guetzloe was married and had three children.

It runs from Umzinto to Donnybrook, passing through Highflats and Ixopo, with a branch from Ixopo to Madonela (Union Bridge). The line was built in 1908 and was in length. Construction The mainline was constructed using second-hand rails becoming available from track upgrades on Cape gauge railways. The total line was laid for £3,200 a mile. The construction and equipment of this railway barely exceeded £300,000. The rails were , in lengths. The ruling gradient was 1 in 33 (3.33%) uncompensated for curvature. The Madonela Branch was built for a maximum axle load of and a speed of at a cost of about £50 000 and the first trains ran on 2 February 1914. Operations In the 1970s a typical crew operation roster consisted of three daily trains: The first train ran from Ixopo to Donnybrook, and return to Ixopo, a full day's shift. The second train also departed from Ixopo but serviced the Madonela branch and then ran back to Ixopo. The third train departed from Umzinto. At Highflats daily trains crossed at one o'clock in the afternoon, exchanged the crew and the locomotives were serviced. A single run costs more than 5 hours. Although there was no official passenger transport, incidental travellers could find a place to travel in the guard's van. There were transshipment facilities to Cape gauge railways at Umzinto and Donnybrook. Closure Various sections of the railway closed between 1985 and 1987 after washouts, but the Ixopo to Madonela branch was rebuilt in 2000 by the Patons Country Narrow Gauge Railway. After closure, the majority of the tracks were lifted to be used on the Welsh Highland Railway. Any leftovers were later recovered for the Patons Country Railway. Locomotives used NGG3, NG11, NG16.

Background The 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in a decisive Israeli victory. However, the Arab nations remained intransigent and were only willing to sign armistice agreements with Israel. Thus, a static situation of “no war, no peace,” emerged. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Arab refugees now camped alongside Israel’s porous borders. The refugees lived in squalor, were kept under martial law and were prevented from gaining citizenship in their respective Arab host countries.Zeev Schiff, History of the Israeli Army, Straight Arrow Books (1974), pp. 220–22 Arab governments, in particular Egypt, sensing the refugees’ discontent, capitalized on the opportunity to recruit embittered Palestinian Arabs for terrorist actions against Israel. At first, the infiltrations and border transgressions took the form of petty banditry and thievery.Schiff, pp. 222–23 However, by 1954, Egyptian military intelligence was taking an active role in providing various forms of support for Palestinian Arab (fedayeen) terrorist activity.Schiff pp. 224–25 After one such atrocity, Israel decided to take decisive action against Egypt for its sponsorship of terror and initiated Operation Black Arrow. Despite its success, Operation Black Arrow did not put a halt to Egyptian sponsorship of fedayeen terror raids and border transgressions. In late August 1955, attacks by Egyptian sponsored fedayeen near the Israeli towns of Rishon LeZion and Rechovot resulted in the deaths of eleven Israelis.P.R. Kumaraswamy, The A to Z of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Scarecrow Press (2006), p. 144 It was therefore decided that an operation, larger in scope and size than anything previously embarked upon, was warranted. The battle On the night of August 31, 1955, paratroops of Israel’s vaunted 890th Battalion assembled to attack Egyptian military installations in Khan Yunis. Among their objectives was a Tegart fort which housed a company of infantry as well as headquarters personnel. A second objective was the taking of an Egyptian emplacement, code-named Position 132, which dominated the Khan Yunis road and was deemed vital to securing the safe withdrawal of the troops.Ze’evi Derori, Israel's reprisal policy, 1953-1956: the dynamics of military retaliation, Frank Cass (2005), p. 140 The raid was codenamed Operation Elkayam, in tribute to Saadya Elkayam, a company commander who died in the Black Arrow operation.Derori, 140 During the late evening, a mechanized force led by commander Mordechai \\"Motta\\" Gur set out for the fort and surrounding installations while forces led by Rafael \\"Raful\\" Eitan secured Position 132. Another force set up an ambush site in case the Egyptians decided to send a relief column. By 22:45 hours, the fort and surrounding emplacements had been secured. Position 132 had been abandoned by the Egyptians and the Israelis destroyed the Egyptian emplacements there. Explosive charges were set and the Tergart fort along with other nearby Egyptian emplacements were dynamited and reduced to rubble. The Egyptians suffered seventy-two killed.P.R. Kumaraswamy, 144Derori, 142 There was one Israeli fatality.Derori, 142 Aftermath Operation Elkayam was the first time that the Israelis employed mounted armor in their reprisal raids. The raid itself was a resounding success clearly reflected by the lopsided casualty count in Israel’s favor. The operation prompted the Egyptians to reassess their sponsorship of fedayeen terrorism and led to a U.N. mediated ceasefire on September 4.Derori, 142 President Nasser halted fedayeen infiltration from the Egyptian border resulting in a temporary lull in fedayeen attacks.P.R. Kumaraswamy, 144 Nevertheless, other Egyptian provocations, including the blockade of the Gulf of Eilat and a major arms deal with a Soviet client state, were factors that led to Israel’s Operation Kadesh and the decisive defeat of the Egyptian army in the Sinai Peninsula.Schiff p 63-69 References Category:Arab–Israeli conflict Category:1955 in Israel Category:1955 in Egypt Category:Retribution operations Category:Counter-terrorism Category:Israel Defense Forces Category:Conflicts in 1955 Category:Khan Yunis ","title":"Operation Elkayam"},{"id":"33691081","text":"Crawley is a surname.

It was headed by Bronisław Baczko and Leszek Kołakowski and also included scholars such as Andrzej Walicki, Jerzy Szacki and Krzysztof Pomian. Members of the group had institutional ties with the PAN Institute of Philosophy and Sociology and the Department of History of Modern Philosophy of the University of Warsaw headed by Baczko and Kołakowski. Critical of orthodox Marxism and the policies of the Polish United Workers Party (which they both were members of), Baczko and Kołakowski became inconvenient figures for the Polish authorities. On 21 October 1966, Kołakowski and Krzysztof Pomian gave formal speeches at a debate at the Faculty of History of the University of Warsaw where they openly criticised the ten-year rule of the Gomułka cabinet for incompetence, restrictions placed on freedom of speech, and the absence of democratic institutions in Poland. Pomian and Kołakowski were immediately expelled from the Communist party, followed by Baczko in 1968. The Warsaw School fully disintegrated in the wake of the March 1968 political crisis. Members of the group were involved in supporting students affected by reprisals in the aftermath of the riots, and many emigrated to escape persecution. Ideas and methods The methods used by members of the Warsaw School were varied, and some have argued that it was more a social grouping of intellectuals than a school of thought. However, certain shared characteristics can be found in works written by the group's members. The School held a researcher is supposed to place himself outside of the investigated subject valued objectivity, pluralism and the political independence of science.

They believed ideologies (including, controversially, Marxism) to be the products of the historical conditions of their times, in contrast to the historical materialist idea that mental structure is solely a derivative of social class.

It can be thought of as an Lp version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, from which it can be deduced. The theorem is named after Maurice René Fréchet and Andrey Kolmogorov.  Statement  Let B be a subset of L^p(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) with p\\\\in[1,\\\\infty), and let \\\\tau_h f denote the translation of f by h, that is, \\\\tau_h f(x)=f(x-h) . The subset B is relatively compact if and only if the following properties hold: #(Equicontinuous) \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\Vert\\\\tau_h f-f\\\\Vert_{L^p(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)} = 0 uniformly on B. #(Equitight) \\\\lim_{r\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_{x>r}\\\\leftf\\\\right^p=0 uniformly on B. The first property can be stated as \\\\forall \\\\varepsilon >0 \\\\, \\\\, \\\\exists \\\\delta >0 such that \\\\Vert\\\\tau_h f-f\\\\Vert_{L^p(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)} < \\\\varepsilon \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall f \\\\in B, \\\\forall h with h<\\\\delta . Usually, the Fréchet–Kolmogorov theorem is formulated with the extra assumption that B is bounded (i.e., \\\\Vert f\\\\Vert_{L^p(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)}<\\\\infty uniformly on B). However, it has been recently shown that equitightness and equicontinuity imply this property. =Special case= For a subset B of L^p(\\\\Omega), where \\\\Omega is a bounded subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, the condition of equitightness is not needed. Hence, a necessary and sufficient condition for B to be relatively compact is that the property of equicontinuity holds. However, this property must be interpreted with care as the below example shows. Examples =Existence of solutions of a PDE= Let (u_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon be a sequence of solutions of the viscous Burgers equation posed in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times(0,T): :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial u^2}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\epsilon\\\\Delta u, \\\\quad u(x,0) = u_0(x), with u_0 smooth enough. If the solutions (u_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon enjoy the L^1-contraction and L^\\\\infty-bound properties, we will show existence of solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial u^2}{\\\\partial x} = 0, \\\\quad u(x,0) = u_0(x). The first property can be stated as follows: If u,v are solutions of the Burgers equation with u_0,v_0 as initial data, then :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}}u(x,t)-v(x,t)dx\\\\leq \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}}u_0(x)-v_0(x)dx. The second property simply means that \\\\Vert u(\\\\cdot,t)\\\\Vert_{L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R})}\\\\leq \\\\Vert u_0\\\\Vert_{L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R})}. Now, let K\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times(0,T) be any compact set, and define :w_\\\\epsilon(x,t):=u_\\\\epsilon(x,t)\\\\mathbf{1}_K(x,t), where \\\\mathbf{1}_K is 1 on the set K and 0 otherwise. Automatically, B:=\\\\\\\\{(w_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\}\\\\subset L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2) since :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^2}w_\\\\epsilon(x,t)dx dt= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^2}u_\\\\epsilon(x,t)\\\\mathbf{1}_K(x,t)dx dt\\\\leq \\\\Vert u_0\\\\Vert_{L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R})}K<\\\\infty. Equicontinuity is a consequence of the L^1-contraction since u_\\\\epsilon(x-h,t) is a solution of the Burgers equation with u_0(x-h) as initial data and since the L^\\\\infty-bound holds: We have that :\\\\Vert w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-w_\\\\epsilon\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}\\\\leq \\\\Vert w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}+\\\\Vert w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)-w_\\\\epsilon\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}. We continue by considering :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\Vert w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\Vert (u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h))\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}+\\\\Vert u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)(\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}. \\\\end{align} The first term on the right-hand side satisfies :\\\\Vert (u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h))\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}\\\\leq T\\\\Vert u_0(\\\\cdot-h)-u_0\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R})} by a change of variable and the L^1-contraction. The second term satisfies :\\\\Vert u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)(\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot-h)-\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h))\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}\\\\leq \\\\Vert u_0\\\\Vert_{L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R})}\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot-h,\\\\cdot)-\\\\mathbf{1}_K\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)} by a change of variable and the L^\\\\infty-bound. Moreover, :\\\\Vert w_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)-w_\\\\epsilon\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}\\\\leq \\\\Vert (u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)-u_\\\\epsilon)\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}+\\\\Vert u_\\\\epsilon(\\\\mathbf{1}_K(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot-h)-\\\\mathbf{1}_K)\\\\Vert_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2)}. Both terms can be estimated as before when noticing that the time equicontinuity follows again by the L^1-contraction. The continuity of the translation mapping in L^1 then gives equicontinuity uniformly on B. Equitightness holds by definition of (w_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon by taking r big enough. Hence, B is relatively compact in L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^2), and then there is a convergent subsequence of (u_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon in L^1(K). By a covering argument, the last convergence is in L_{loc}^1(\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times(0,T)). To conclude existence, it remains to check that the limit function, as \\\\epsilon\\\\to0^+, of a subsequence of (u_\\\\epsilon)_\\\\epsilon satisfies :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial u^2}{\\\\partial x} = 0, \\\\quad u(x,0) = u_0(x).

It was founded in 1922 to offer employment opportunities to wounded soldiers returning from the First World War, creating remembrance products for the Royal Family and The Royal British Legion’s annual Poppy Appeal. It is operated by a company that is a registered charity which provides employment support to disabled veterans across England and Wales. The factory makes approximately 36 million poppies each year. The corresponding organisation in Scotland is Lady Haig's Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, which was established in 1926 and makes approximately five million remembrance poppies each year. History Artificial poppies for the first poppy appeal in 1921 had been imported from France by Madame Anna Guérin, but in 1922 the Disabled Society, a charity established in 1920 by Major George Howson MC and Major Jack Cohen, received a grant of £2,000 from the British Legion's Unity Relief Fund to employ disabled ex-service personnel to make remembrance poppies in England. Later that year, Howson wrote to his parents, “I do not think it can be a great success, but it is worth trying. I consider the attempt ought to be made if only to give the disabled their chance.\\" They set up in a former collar factory on the Old Kent Road in London. Soon the factory was employing 50 disabled veterans. The factory made a million poppies within two months. In November 1924, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) visited the Poppy Factory, which made 27 million poppies that year. Most of the employees were disabled, and by then there was a long waiting list for prospective employees. The old collar factory eventually proved too small as demand increased, and in 1926 the factory moved to a disused brewery in Petersham Road, Richmond, Surrey. Housing for the workforce and their families was built on adjacent land and in 1932 the present factory was built. The original factory was demolished in 1972. Present day A volunteer assembles remembrance poppies at the Royal British Legion Poppy Factory, Richmond Each remembrance poppy is put together by hand Approximately 30 disabled veterans and disabled dependents of ex-service personnel are employed at the Richmond factory to hand-make remembrance poppies, wreaths and symbols.

A team of regional Employability Consultants work with veterans in their communities to provide career guidance, CV advice, interview coaching, opportunities with local employers and information about funding and training sources. Around 62% of Poppy Factory veterans experienced mental health conditions and 58% reported physical health challenges, such as visual impairments and musculoskeletal problems. Many veterans have a combination of both mental and physical health challenges. According to a recent report, the charity’s \\"Getting You Back to Work\\" employability programme has close fidelity to the IPS model of Supported Employment.The Poppy Factory Employment in Mind Report 2016 http://www.poppyfactory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MH_report_2016.pdf Owing to this tailored approach, around 75% of Poppy Factory ‘clients’ remain in work for over 12 months. Since 1928, The Poppy Factory has also organised the annual Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey. In November 2016, former chief executive Melanie Waters, became the chief executive of Help for Heroes charity. Deirdre Mills was later appointed the new chief executive, she has been a Director at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The factory in Richmond is open to the public for guided tours. In July 2017, The Queen visited the Factory to celebrate the charity’s 90th anniversary. Lady Haig's Poppy Factory Former site of Lady Haig's Poppy Factory in Edinburgh from 1931 to 1965 Lady Haig's Poppy Factory is a charity based in Edinburgh Scotland to provide employment to disabled veterans. It is an independent charity, but the name Lady Haig's Poppy Factory is a trading name of Poppyscotland of which it is a subsidiary. Lady Haig's Poppy Factory was founded in March 1926, shortly after the Royal British Legion's factory in London. It was created to serve the demand for Remembrance Day poppies in Scotland. The factory was created at the suggestion of and by Dorothy, Countess Haig, wife of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, who had created the Haig Fund to assist ex-servicemen and which still raises funds through the UK's annual poppy appeal. It grew from two employees in a former wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House to employ over 100 people by the mid-1930s, with a waiting list of over 300. In addition to the main task of making poppies, the employees made other goods by hand which were sold at three shops in Edinburgh and by a travelling shop throughout Scotland. The factory moved to its current premises, a former printing works, in 1965. Staffing levels and the range of goods made at the factory gradually declined after the Second World War, and increasing annual deficits were funded by contributions from the Earl Haig Fund Scotland. In 1998, the factory became an independent charitable company, The Lady Haig Poppy Factory Ltd In November 2018 the factory was and moved into Redford Barracks for 2 years temporarily while major revelations could be made while also adding a new learning facility. With a Virtual Reality Application being made to preserve the persevere the memory of the old factory and to continue to bring the message of remembrance to a whole new generation. The factory is operated in partnership with Poppyscotland and, like the Poppy Factory in Richmond, also employs ex-service personnel, all disabled, making five million remembrance poppies in Edinburgh each year, to a slightly different design with four-lobed petals rather than two for English poppies, and 12,000 wreaths.

A hobby horse (or hobby-horse) can be considered a toy. Although it can also be considered sports equipment. The hobby horse is a stuffed horse that often has yarn as a mane. They usually show only what would be the horses neck, but some may be just the head. At the bottom there is a small stick that go in between the riders legs. Some hobby horses may include a bridle with reins attached to it.You can get a cheap hobby horse that is mass produced, or you can get one that is hand-made for up to $1000. Hobby horsing is a sport as it contains physical activity. Some famous hobby horse discipline's are dressage, show jumping, and hunters. Hobby horses as toys will usually have a much longer stick that may drag on the ground. Hobby horses used for sports often have a shorter stick that will be easier to jump and run with.

They vary in size from a costume for one person to large frameworks carried by nine people. In The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, the characters' hobby-horses, or particular obsessions, are discussed in detail. Here, Uncle Toby's obsession with the military leads him and Trim - who gets caught up in Toby's enthusiasm - to begin acting out military actions. Illustration by George Cruikshank. From \\"hobby horse\\" (see Etymology, below) came the expression \\"to ride one's hobby-horse\\", meaning \\"to follow a favourite pastime\\", and in turn, the modern sense of the term hobby.\\"hobby,\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2010-06-26. The term is also connected to the draisine, a forerunner of the bicycle, invented by Baron Karl von Drais. In 1818, a London coach-maker named Denis Johnson began producing an improved version, which was popularly known as the \\"hobby-horse\\".David V. Herlihy, Bicycle, Yale University Press, 2004; pp. 31-38. The artistic movement, Dada, is possibly named after a French child's word for hobby-horse.Marc Dachy, Dada & les dadaïsmes, Paris, Gallimard, \\"Folio Essais\\", n° 257, 1994.  Etymology  The word hobby is glossed by the OED as \\"a small or middle-sized horse; an ambling or pacing horse; a pony.\\" The word is attested in English from the 14th century, as Middle English hobyn. Old French had hobin or haubby, whence Modern French aubin and Italian ubino. But the Old French term is apparently adopted from English rather than vice versa. OED connects it to \\"the by-name Hobin, Hobby\\", a variant of Robin\\" (compare the abbreviation Hob for Robert). This appears to have been a name customarily given to a cart-horse, as attested by White Kennett in his Parochial Antiquities (1695), who stated that \\"Our ploughmen to some one of their cart-horses generally give the name of Hobin, the very word which Phil. Comines uses, Hist. VI. vii.\\" Another familiar form of the same Christian name, Dobbin has also become a generic name for a cart-horse. Samuel Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language, 1755, glosses \\"A strong, active horse, of a middle size, said to have been originally from Ireland; an ambling nag.\\"  Further use  Hoblers or hovellers were men who kept a light nag that they may give instant information of threatened invasion. (Old French, hober, to move up and down; our hobby, q.v.) In mediæval times their duties were to reconnoitre, to carry intelligence, to harass stragglers, to act as spies, to intercept convoys, and to pursue fugitives. Henry Spelman (d. 1641) derived the word from \\"hobby\\". Border horses, called hobblers or hobbies, were small and active and trained to cross the most difficult and boggy country \\"and to get over where our footmen could scarce dare to follow.\\" - George MacDonald Fraser, The Steel Bonnets, The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers. Hobby horse polo partly uses polo rules but has its own specialities, e.g. 'punitive sherries', and uses hobby horses instead of ponies. The hobby horse variant of polo started in 1998 as a fun sport in south western Germany and lead 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in Mannheim. It has since gained further interest in other German cities. In cartoons The hobby horse has been used numerous times in classic cartoons and in some new ones incorporating a Wild West theme. *The Looney Tunes cartoon Buckaroo Bugs had Bugs Bunny riding a hobby horse while shooting a gun to escape from Red Hot Ryder as the Masked Marauder. *There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Wagon Heels, and it shows Injun Joe using the toy to head to a massacre. *There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Hobby Horse Laffs, but instead of a hobby horse in the title card, it shows a rocking horse instead. *There is a Merrie Melodies cartoon called I've Got to Sing a Torch Song. In one short scene, a caricature of Ed Wynn rode a revamped version of a hobby horse towards a microphone to make an announcement. *The Sheriff Callie's Wild West episode Peck Clowns Around had Peck dressed up as a rodeo clown riding a hobby horse instead of a real horse, like Sparky, that Sheriff Callie used in a rodeo. He thought it was humiliating, and he was laughed at by the entire audience, making Peck very angry. *One of Spot the Dog's toys is a hobby horse, usually stored under the stairs or in a closet in his house. It was used numerous times in Spot cartoons animated by King Rollo Films. In the Discover Spot episode Spot's Hobby Horse, Spot rides his hobby horse outdoors, then Steve takes a turn. When Helen strolls by the neighborhood to say hello to her friends, she is fascinated by Spot's hobby horse, so Steve hands it over to her. Steve then uses a stick as a hobby horse for the rest of this episode. Spot uses a broom and rides it like a hobby horse after failing to use a hose as one for the rest of this episode as well. The toy was also used in the Discover Spot episode Spot's Show, except it was used by Tom this time when he was pretending to be a cowboy in Spot's theatrical production. The Adventures of Spot episode Spot Goes to a Party has Spot dressed up as a cowboy going to a costume party. Sally gives him his hobby horse as an accessory to complete his look, explaining to him \\"Here's something else for your costume!\\" He then takes his hobby horse over to the party located at Helen's house but he left it over there. It is unknown if he ever picked up the toy from Helen's house to take back to his house. Instead of taking his hobby horse home, Spot rode home in a two-person yellow polka dotted horse costume, controlled by Steve and Tom, while acting like a cute little cowboy shouting \\"Howdy Mom! It was a great party!\\" See also *'Obby 'Oss festival References Category:Traditional toys Category:Wooden toys Horse Category:Horses in art ","title":"Hobby horse (toy)"},{"id":"33691277","text":"Purpureocillium is a fungal genus in the Ophiocordycipitaceae family.

It has been isolated from a wide range of habitats, including cultivated and uncultivated soils, forests, grassland, deserts, estuarine sediments and sewage sludge, and insects. It has also been found in nematode eggs, and occasionally from females of root-knot and cyst nematodes. In addition, it has frequently been detected in the rhizosphere of many crops. The species can grow at a wide range of temperatures – from for a few isolates, with optimal growth in the range . It also has a wide pH tolerance and can grow on a variety of substrates.

He was responsible of the most immediate service to the Monarch. This Office was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975.  Historical precedents  This Office was created when, during the Habsburg dynasty, the Spanish Royal Court was shaped after that one that existed in the Court of Burgundy where this Office “Sumiller” from the French “Sommelier”, literally “Wine steward” existed from the old past. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, but also King of Spain, imported the etiquette styled in the Court of his paternal grandmother Mary of Burgundy.  Regime during the 16th, the 17th and the 18th centuries  Diverse dispositions regulated the duties of the “Sumiller de Corps” distinguishing from those of the “Mayordomo mayor” to the King. Although this latter Office was hierarchically higher, the Office of “Sumiller de Corps” was mostly coveted by the high ranks of the nobility, the Grandees of Spain, as it gave full access to the intimacy of the King. And, certainly, thanks to this intimacy with the King, he could influence the concession and distribution of all kinds of graces and mercies. In fact, the Validos of the Habsburg Kings were always their “Sumilleres de Corps” as it happened with the Duke of Lerma and the Duke of Uceda with King Philip III or the Count-Duke of Olivares with King Philip IV. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the ceremonial laws regulating the Royal service confirmed the principal prerogatives that the traditional Burgundian etiquette granted to the “Sumiller de Corps”, in the measure in which they supposed a great intimacy and a physical daily contact with the Monarch. Those of the Royal Chamber of 1659 established that the organization of the closest service to the King corresponded to the “Sumiller de Corps” and, in this way, he might sleep in a bed in the same room of the Sovereign. If this was not possible, or the Monarch wanted to relieve him of this obligation, he had to sleep at least in the Royal Palace. He had, anyway, to deliver the King personally the towel, the shirt, the Golden Fleece, the clothes and the cap and, during meals and dinners, serve him the glass of wine. Only a peer who had the rank of Grandee of Spain could be appointed for this Office.  Regime during the 19th and 20th centuries  With King Ferdinand VII this Office was losing the more and more importance. In fact, it was suppressed by his grandson Alfonso XII when monarchy was restored in 1875. It was not until 1906 that it was created again but with a pure symbolistic character and always attached to the Office of “Mayordomo mayor” as this was the highest office of the Royal Household. The sole exception to this rule was between 1925 and 1927 when the second one was exercised by the duke of Miranda and the first one by the Marquess of Viana, Caballerizo mayor, who in addition, had the privy seal of the King. In spite of the latter circumstance, under the “Sumiller de Corps”, at least organically, and in agreement with his former function which t has been mentioned before, they were the royal servants who accompanied at all time the Monarch, the “Gentilhombres Grandes de España con ejercicio y servidumbre” (Gentlemen of the bedchamber Grandees of Spain) and those called “Gentilhombres de camara con ejercicio” (Gentlemen of the bedchamber). Equally until their suppression in 1918, there existed under his command the ranks of “Gentilhombres de Casa y Boca” (literally the Gentlemen of House and Mouth), and “Gentilhombres de Entrada” (literally Gentlemen of Entry). All this classes of royal servants were chosen between gentlemen, mostly from the nobility, and in the latter times of the reign of Alfonso XIII from people with prestigious professional background as famous officers of the Army, well- known physicians or businessmen, etc. Only the first one of these classes, the Gentlemen Grandees of Spain, had real functions close to the King and they had a weekly shift to stay with the Monarch in all sorts of activities.

It has been isolated from a wide range of habitats, including cultivated and uncultivated soils, forests, grassland, deserts, estuarine sediments and sewage sludge, and insects. It has also been found in nematode eggs, and occasionally from females of root-knot and cyst nematodes. In addition, it has frequently been detected in the rhizosphere of many crops. The species can grow at a wide range of temperatures – from for a few isolates, with optimal growth in the range . It also has a wide pH tolerance and can grow on a variety of substrates. P. lilacinum has shown promising results for use as a biocontrol agent to control the growth of destructive root-knot nematodes. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was originally described by American mycologist Charles Thom in 1910, under than name Penicillium lilacinum. Taxonomic synonyms include Penicillium amethystinum Wehmer and Spicaria rubidopurpurea Aoki. In 1974, Robert A. Samson transferred the species to Paecilomyces. Publications in the 2000s (decade) indicated that the genus Paecilomyces was not monophyletic, and that close relatives were Paecilomyces nostocoides, Isaria takamizusanensis and Nomuraea atypicola. The new genus Purpureocillium was created to hold the taxon. The generic name refers to the purple conidia produced by the fungus. Description Purpureocillium lilacinum forms a dense mycelium which gives rise to conidiophores. These bear phialides from the ends of which spores are formed in long chains. Spores germinate when suitable moisture and nutrients are available. Colonies on malt agar grow rather fast, attaining a diameter of 5–7 cm within 14 days at , consisting of a basal felt with a floccose overgrowth of aerial mycelium; at first white, but when sporulating changing to various shades of vinaceous. The reverse side is sometimes uncolored but usually in vinaceous shades. The vegetative hyphae are smooth-walled, hyaline, and 2.5–4.0 µm wide. Conidiophores arising from submerged hyphae, 400–600 µm in length, or arising from aerial hyphae and half as long. Phialides consisting of a swollen basal part, tapering into a thin distinct neck. Conidia are in divergent chains, ellipsoid to fusiform in shape, and smooth walled to slightly roughened. Chlamydospores are absent. Life cycles Purpureocillium lilacinum is highly adaptable in its life strategy: depending on the availability of nutrients in the surrounding microenvironments it may be entomopathogenic, mycoparasitic, saprophytic, as well as nematophagous. Human pathogenicity Purpureocillium lilacinum is an infrequent cause of human disease. Most reported cases involve patients with compromised immune systems, indwelling foreign devices, or intraocular lens implants. Research of the last decade suggests it may be an emerging pathogen of both immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent adults.Carey J, D’Amico R, Sutton DA, Rinaldi MG. Paecilomyces lilacinus vaginitis in an immunocompetent patient. Emerg Infect Dis [serial online] 2003 Sep Biocontrol agent P. lilacinum is used as a biocontrol agent for several nematode species, such as Meloidogyne incognita, shown here. Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant economic losses to a wide variety of crops. Chemical control is a widely used option for plant-parasitic nematode management. However, chemical nematicides are now being reappraised in respect of environmental hazard, high costs, limited availability in many developing countries or their diminished effectiveness following repeated applications. = Control of plant-parasitic nematodes = Purpureocillium lilacinum was first observed in association with nematode eggs in 1966 and the fungus was subsequently found parasitising the eggs of Meloidogyne incognita in Peru. It has now been isolated from many cyst and root-knot nematodes and from soil in many locations. Several successful field trials using P. lilacinum against pest nematodes were conducted in Peru. The Peruvian isolate was then sent to nematologists in 46 countries for testing, as part of the International Meloidogyne project, resulting in many more field trials on a range of crops in many soil types and climates. Field trials, glasshouse trials and in vitro testing of P. lilacinum continues and more isolates have been collected from soil, nematodes and occasionally from insects. Isolates vary in their pathogenicity to plant-parasitic nematodes. Some isolates are aggressive parasites while others, though morphologically indistinguishable, are less or non-pathogenic. Sometimes isolates that looked promising in vitro or in glasshouse trials have failed to provide control in the field. = Enzymes = Many enzymes produced by P. lilacinum have been studied. A basic serine protease with biological activity against Meloidogyne hapla eggs has been identified. One strain of P. lilacinum has been shown to produce proteases and a chitinase, enzymes that could weaken a nematode egg shell so as to enable a narrow infection peg to push through. = Egg infection = Before infecting a nematode egg, P. lilacinum flattens against the egg surface and becomes closely appressed to it. P. lilacinum produces simple appressoria anywhere on the nematode egg shell either after a few hyphae grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears to indicate that the egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the appressorium appears the same, as a simple swelling at the end of a hypha, closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the appressorium and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration hypha. When the hypha has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty egg shell to produce conidiophores and to grow towards adjacent eggs. Mycotoxins Paecilotoxin is a mycotoxin isolated from the fungus. Its significance is unknown. Khan et al. (2003) tested one strain of P. lilacinum for the production of paecilotoxin and were unable to show toxin production in that strain, suggesting that toxin synthesis may vary among isolates.

Systematic trading includes both manual trading of systems, and full or partial automation using computers. Although technical systematic systems are more common, there are also systems using fundamental data such as those in equity long:short hedge funds and GTAA funds. Systematic trading includes both high frequency trading (HFT, sometimes called algorithmic trading) and slower types of investment such as systematic trend following. It also includes passive index tracking. The opposite of systematic trading is discretionary trading. The disadvantage of discretionary trading is that it may be influenced by emotions, isn't easily back tested, and has less rigorous risk control.Systematic trading, benefits and risks Systematic trading is related to quantitative trading. Quantitative trading includes all trading which use quantitative techniques; most quantitative trading involves using techniques to value market assets like derivatives but the trading decision may be systematic or discretionary.  Approach  Suppose we need to replicate an index with futures and stocks from other markets with higher liquidity level. An example of systematic approach would be: # Identify, using fundamental analysis, which stocks and futures should be used for replication. # Analyze correlations between targeted index and selected stocks and futures, looking for the strategy which provides a better approximation to index. # Define a coherent strategy to combine dynamically stocks and futures according to market data. # Simulate the strategy including transaction costs, rollovers, stop-loss orders and all other wanted risk controls. # Apply the strategy in the real world using algorithmic trading for signal generation and trying to optimize the P&L;, controlling continuously the risks.  Elements  Following the ideas of Irene Aldridge's, who describes a specific HFT system, a more general systematic trading system should include these elements: # Data management (in real time and for backtesting purposes) # A signal generation system (to create, buy and sell signals according to predefined strategies using quantitative methods) # A portfolio and P&L; tracking system # A quantitative risk management system (defining exposure per market, group, or portfolio) # A routing and execution subsystem (usually containing execution trading algorithms, like TWAP, VWAP...) = Backtesting = The key point in systematic trading is the use of backtests to verify (at least partially) strategies and alternatives. It's a basic point in backtesting to have easy and robust access to trading data. = Risk management = Systematic trading should take into account the importance of risk management, using a systematic approach to quantify risk, consistent limits and techniques to define how to close excessively risky positions. Systematic trading, in fact, lends itself to control risk precisely because it allows money managers to define profit targets, loss points, trade size, and system shutdown points objectively and in advance of entering each trade.

The 40,000 square foot building houses a collection of 150,000 items, an automated materials handling system (AMH) for check in and rough sortation of materials, 82 public computers, two meeting rooms, a reading lounge with fireplace, a teen area, a children's area with a Family Reading Lounge, and several installations of artwork. At the time of its opening in 2004, the Eden Prairie Library was the first public building in Minnesota to incorporate a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity (see below). It is currently closed for remodeling, and is set to open in November. The Eden Prairie Library has the highest circulation of all the Hennepin County libraries; in 2012 the number of materials circulated amounted to over 1.165 million items. History Eden Prairie Reading Center, ca. 1972 Eden Prairie's first community library was located in the Eden Prairie Consolidated School, which opened in 1924. The school board contracted with Hennepin County Library to use the school library space, and the first librarians were responsible for managing both the school and county library collections. Eventually the school collection increased to the point that there was no space for the county collection and the partnership with the school library was dissolved in the 1950s. The Hennepin County Bookmobile then served the community until the 1970s. The first independent location of the community library opened in 1972 as the Eden Prairie Reading Center, a 1540 square foot double Quonset hut located at 7420 Eden Prairie Road, with a collection of 12,000 items. In 1986 a new 15,000 square foot building was completed on Prairie Center Drive at a cost of $1.58 million. This new location became known as the Eden Prairie Community Library, with an expanded collection of 47,000 items. Eden Prairie experienced rapid growth during the next two decades, growing from a population of 16,000 in 1980 to a population of 54,000 in 2000. Hennepin County Library saw the need for a larger facility in the community, and a new location became available one block away in a former Lund's grocery store space. Groundbreaking for the $17.6 million renovation project, designed by Minneapolis-based architects Bentz/Thompson/Rietow, took place in July 2002, but the project was put on hold in March 2003 when general contractor Oakwood Builders defaulted on construction work due to financial problems. The project suffered a six-month shut down until The Keystone Group was chosen to complete the construction. Water damage occurring during the shut down required remediation work, adding $1 million in cost to the county. After a delay of nearly a year the new Eden Prairie Library opened its doors to the public on August 12, 2004.Johnson, Brian, “Eden Prairie library finally opens, despite setbacks” Hydrogen fuel cell demonstration project A hydrogen fuel cell installed in the Eden Prairie Library facility in 2004 was the first of its kind to be installed in a public building in Minnesota. The fuel cell project was funded by the Minnesota State Office of Environmental Assistance with additional support from CenterPoint Energy and 3M, and was incorporated into the building as a demonstration project of the county's “Green Building and Energy Conservation Initiatives.” Five kilowatts of electricity could be produced by the library's fuel cell, enough to power a typical home. The purpose of the demonstration project was to provide information on the fuel cell's operation to the Office of Environmental Assistance and to educate the public about fuel cell technology and potential applications.Johnson, Brian, “Eden Prairie library finally opens, despite setbacks” Artwork The mosaic covered planters feature the poem To Make a Prairie by Emily Dickinson Hennepin County Library incorporates public artwork into many of its locations.

The new Senators remained in Washington through 1971 playing at Griffith Stadium in their first season and at RFK Stadium for the next 10 years. In 1972, the team moved to Arlington, Texas, where it became the Texas Rangers. The Rangers played at Arlington Stadium from 1972 to 1993, Globe Life Park in Arlington from 1994 to 2019. The team moved into Globe Life Field in 2020. The Senators/Rangers franchise is widely regarded as one of the most unsuccessful organizations in all of North American professional sports. It took the team 36 seasons to finally make the playoffs and they have since made only eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a wild card team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, taking 50 years to become the final team of the 30 active clubs to win a first round series, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. The team then brought home their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games. In the 2010 World Series, the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the 2011 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. As of their 60th season, they have the dubious distinction of actively holding the longest current drought amongst all North American pro sports franchises that are yet to win their first league championship, and only the Cleveland Indians hold a longer MLB title drought. Washington Senators: 1961–1971 The Washington Senators played at RFK Stadium from 1962 to 1971. When the original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota in 1960 as the Twins, Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off threats of losing its exemption from the Sherman Antitrust Act. At the winter meetings that year, it awarded a new team to Los Angeles (the Angels) as well as a new team in the nation's capital. This new team adopted the old Senators name, but was (and still is) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an expansion draft. The team played the season at old Griffith Stadium before moving to District of Columbia Stadium (now the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium). For most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators—\\"Washington: first in war, first in peace and still last in the American League.\\" Frank Howard, known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. Ownership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Owner Pete Queseda once wondered why he needed to pay players who didn't belong in the majors and later agreed to a ten-year lease at D.C. Stadium—a move that would come back to haunt the Senators. In , Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers James Johnston and James Lemon owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnston died in and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive Bob Short, who outbid a group headed by Bob Hope. Short named himself general manager and hired Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager. Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept them in contention for most of the 1969 season, bringing them in at 86-76 for fourth place in the AL East. Attendance surged to over 918,000, at the time the highest in Washington baseball history. President Richard Nixon throwing out the first ball of the Senators' season in April 1969 with manager Ted Williams (left) and owner Bob Short (right, partially obscured by Yankees manager Ralph Houk) However, this would not last. Short had borrowed most of the $9.4 million he had paid for the team. Serving as his own general manager, Short was forced to make many questionable trades to service the debt and bring in much-needed revenue. As a result, the team rapidly fell back into the American League's cellar. Fans kept their distance from the Senators while the Baltimore Orioles, to the northeast, won four American League pennants and two World Series from 1966 through 1971. As it turned out, the 1969 season would be the only time the franchise would manage so much as a .500 record in its first 12 years. As well, the Senators would never approach their 1969 gate again during their stay in Washington; it would remain the franchise record for attendance until 1974–the franchise's fourth year in Texas. By the end of the season, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (in comparison, the New York Yankees were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and move the team elsewhere. At that season's end, Short dealt his best starting pitcher and the left side of his infield to the Detroit Tigers for erstwhile 30-game-winner Denny McLain, who had spent most of the 1970 campaign suspended because of gambling allegations. The deal—alleged by onetime Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield to have been made in order to secure the Tigers' vote in favor of the Senators' eventual move to Texas—turned Detroit back into contenders, while McLain was a monumental bust, losing a league-worst 22 games. Short was especially receptive to an offer from Arlington, Texas mayor Tom Vandergriff, who had been trying to get a Major League team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Kansas City Athletics, sought to move his team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed by the other AL team owners. Arlington's hole card was Turnpike Stadium, a 10,000-seat park which had been built in to house the AA Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs of the Texas League. However, it had been built to Major League specifications. It was also located in a natural bowl, meaning only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate Major League crowds. After Vandergriff offered a multimillion-dollar down payment, Short decided to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, (by a vote of 10–2, the Orioles' Jerold Hoffberger and John Allyn of the Chicago White Sox registering the dissenting votes), American League owners granted approval for the season. Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \\"SHORT STINKS\\". With the Senators leading 7–5 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed first base and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, umpire crew chief Jim Honochick forfeited the game to the New York Yankees. Even after the move, the Rangers retained the rights to the Senators name, which meant the current Washington team, who relocated from Montreal in , would revive another longtime name, the Nationals (which was used by several NL teams in the 19th century, as well as the first AL Senators team from 1905 to 1955). However, the Rangers allowed the Nationals to use the curly W logo that originated with the expansion Senators. Naming of the Rangers After moving from Washington, the Senators were renamed after the Texas Rangers, the state-wide investigative law-enforcement agency which was founded by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 when Texas was part of Mexico, and whose mythology led to fictional characters such as The Lone Ranger and Walker, Texas Ranger. But the Rangers also had bouts as vigilante squads, when they abused their authority,Harris, Charles H. III & Sadler, Louis R., The Texas Rangers And The Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910–1920. including by lynching Hispanics. In the wake of 2020's Black Lives Matter protests, prominent mainstream voices have shined a light on the historical racism associated with the law-enforcement agency and called for the baseball team to abandon the Rangers name. The baseball team responded by committing to keeping the Rangers name. First years in Texas: 1972–1984 During the off-season, improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as Arlington Stadium for the 1972 season. Meanwhile, ownership announced that the franchise would be renamed the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1–0 loss at the California Angels. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5–1 for the club's first victory. After the season Ted Williams retired as manager; he had made no secret of his displeasure with the franchise's new location. Whitey Herzog was named the new manager, but he was replaced before the end of the 1973 season by Billy Martin. In 1974, the Rangers began to come into their own as a team. They finished the season second in the American League West with an 84–76 record, behind the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics. The 1974 Rangers are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. Mike Hargrove was awarded A.L. Rookie of the Year, Billy Martin was named Manager of the Year, Jeff Burroughs won American League MVP, and Ferguson Jenkins was named the Comeback Player of the Year after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. However, after a 44–51 start in 1975, Martin was fired as the Rangers' manager and was replaced by Frank Lucchesi. After excellent seasons between 1977–79, the Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in the first half of 1981. But when Texas lost its last game before the players' strike began, the Oakland A's won the AL West in the first half by a half-game. After 1981, the Rangers would not post another winning record for five seasons. During this stretch, the Rangers made one of their most unpopular trades ever, sending multi-Gold Glove catcher and fan favorite Jim Sundberg to the Milwaukee Brewers for future Brewers’ manager Ned Yost, who later managed the Kansas City Royals to the 2015 World Series championship. The Rangers faced attendance problems for a few years after moving to Texas, in part due to the team's inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity that can overtake the area in the summer. Until the Florida Marlins arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, with temperatures frequently topping throughout the summer months. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even their weekend games between May and September at night—a tradition that continued until the opening of retractable-roofed Globe Life Field in 2020. Beginning in 1990, the Rangers usually received a waiver from ESPN to play Sunday night games and televise them in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The Valentine, Ryan, and Bush years: 1985–1994 Bobby Valentine, who would eventually become the Rangers' longest-serving manager at 1,186 games, became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of many stellar young rookies such as Rubén Sierra, Pete Incaviglia, Mitch Williams, Bobby Witt, and Edwin Correa, the Rangers finished in 2nd place with an 87–75 record, just five games behind the division champion California Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in a yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher Nolan Ryan prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th strikeout, 300th win, and sixth and seventh no-hitters with the Rangers. Coupled with powerful batters like Juan González, Rubén Sierra, Julio Franco, and Rafael Palmeiro and a pitching staff that also included Charlie Hough, Bobby Witt, Kevin Brown, and Kenny Rogers, fans held high expectations for the Rangers. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season. Rangers Ballpark in Arlington In April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon Eddie Chiles, sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush, son of the President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed a group of investors that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was a small one (about ten percent), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year. During his tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991 on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named Globe Life Park in Arlington). The city, through the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority, also controversially authorized the seizure of of land through eminent domain for the Rangers future development. Landowners filed lawsuits over the acquisition and eventually won settlements of $22.2 million which the Rangers failed to pay. Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected Governor of Texas in 1994, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States in 2000. Although Bush no longer has any ownership stake in the Rangers, he remains a fan of the team to this day and regularly attends the team's home games. In 1993, Kevin Kennedy took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the A.L. West (with a 52-62 record) prior to the players' strike. The strike prematurely ended what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when commissioner Bud Selig canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Regardless of the unceremonious end to the 1994 season, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th perfect game in Major League history on July 28. First success: 1995–2000 The year 1995 saw the beginnings of promise for the Rangers. With a brand new ballpark that hosted its first All-Star Game that year, Johnny Oates was hired as the Rangers' manager. Oates and company promptly helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, three games to one. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and Juan González was named A.L. MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters with Iván Rodríguez, Will Clark, Mark McLemore, Dean Palmer, Rusty Greer, Juan González, and Mickey Tettleton but continued to struggle with pitching—a common stereotype of Rangers teams—despite having Rick Helling, and Aaron Sele on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive A.L. West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three world championships in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team would be the last playoff-bound team for over a decade, as the Rangers took a step backwards at the beginning of the new millennium. En route to a second straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28 games into the 2001 season. The Rangers finished the decade going 1–9 in the postseason, without a single home win. In 1998, venture capital billionaire Tom Hicks bought the team for $250 million. Hicks also agreed to pay the $22.2 million awarded in settlements in relation to the 1991 eminent domain litigation concerning the Ballpark in Arlington.George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers , Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04. The lean years: 2001–2004 =The A-Rod era: 2001–2003= Prior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez, was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a ten-year, $252 million contract. The move was considered controversial and was frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager Jerry Narron was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager Buck Showalter. The 2003 season signified the fourth straight last- place finish, and after a post-season fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning A.L. MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and infielder prospect Joaquin Arias. In the spring of 2009, Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers. During the investigations into PED use earlier in the decade, several other former Rangers players were criticized for possible use of performance-enhancers. These included notable '90s sluggers Jose Canseco, Iván Rodríguez, Juan González, and Rafael Palmeiro. =2004= Michael Young Prior to the 2004 season, little hope was held out for the Rangers to improve on their losing ways. However, the Rangers battled with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Oakland Athletics for first place in the A.L. West for much of the season. Mark Teixeira, Alfonso Soriano, Michael Young, and Hank Blalock became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano were named to the 2004 All-Star Game. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2for3 with a three-run home run. Late in September, the Oakland A's visited Arlington for a three-game series. After taking the first two games of the series, the Rangers trailed 4–2, in the bottom of the ninth. A loss would have dropped them to four games behind the Athletics. A home run by Hank Blalock and a dramatic two-out, two-run double by David Dellucci (known amongst fans as the \\"Dellucci Double\\") gave the Rangers a 5–4 win, one of the most memorable in club history. It also allowed the Rangers to sweep the first-place Athletics and leave them just two games behind with ten to play. Unfortunately, the Rangers ended up losing six of the final ten games and another turnaround season came up short. The club finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place. 2005–2009 =2005= In 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that the team swept an entire homestand for the first time in its history. Frank Francisco and Carlos Almanzar, two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined for Tommy John surgery. Kenny Rogers, the team's ace pitcher, received a 20-game suspension from commissioner Bud Selig for attacking a cameraman at Ameriquest Field prior to a game. Management later placed opening day starter Ryan Drese on waivers, where he was claimed by the Washington Nationals. After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1–12 August road trip all but sealed the squad's fate. On October 4, 2005, the Rangers announced that John Hart would step down as general manager and that Jon Daniels was being promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, would become the youngest general manager in Major League history. Daniels and the Rangers front office were very active in the 2005–06 offseason. Alfonso Soriano, who had often been mentioned in trade speculation, was finally dealt to the Nationals for outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel Sledge. The Rangers then began making moves to acquire pitching talent. The Rangers gained enigmatic starter Vicente Padilla from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Ricardo Rodríguez and acquired San Diego Padres pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka in exchange for Chris Young, Adrián González, and Sledge. Finally, they signed free agent starter Kevin Millwood to a five-year contract worth $60 million. =2006: Building the brand= The Rangers 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80–82 record and a third-place finish in the West. Though the club showed strength in the early going, the team proved unable to keep pace with the surging Oakland Athletics in the second half and fell out of contention in September. To some extent the Rangers were the victims of bad luck, as their win-loss record was worse than their +51 run differential for the season would normally indicate. However, the element the club continued to lack was a solid pitching staff, whose combined ERA ranked 9th in the A.L. at the season's end. The Rangers were represented in the 2006 All-Star game by center fielder Gary Matthews, Jr. and shortstop Michael Young, who was named the MVP for his game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning. Significant player moves in-season included a July 28 deal acquiring outfielders Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero, and Laynce Nix. On October 4 after two attempts to replicate the success of the 2004 team, the Rangers dismissed Buck Showalter as manager with three years left on his contract. A month later, the team announced that Oakland Athletics third base coach Ron Washington had accepted their offer to manage the team. A change at manager would be the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy off-season. Gary Matthews, Jr., Mark DeRosa, Carlos Lee, and Adam Eaton all signed with other clubs as free agents. Vicente Padilla accepted a three-year, $33 million offer with an option for a fourth year at $12 million. The Rangers also signed 1B/OF Frank Catalanotto to a multi-year deal. The Rangers later added reliever Éric Gagné and veteran outfielders Kenny Lofton and Sammy Sosa on short-term deals. In a sign that GM Jon Daniels was looking for results in 2007, the Rangers' top pitching prospect John Danks was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with reliever Nick Masset for 23-year-old starter Brandon McCarthy. The Danks trade caused quite a stir amongst fans, many of which had followed the minor league careers of the highly touted \\"DVD\\" trio of pitchers that included Danks, Edinson Vólquez, and Thomas Diamond. All three pitchers would eventually reach the majors, with varying degrees of success, while McCarthy's career became marred by injury. Home Plate Entrance at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington The Rangers previously negotiated a 30-year, $75 million stadium naming rights agreement with Ameriquest Mortgage Company in 2004, renaming the Ballpark \\"Ameriquest Field\\". Under the Ameriquest moniker, the Ballpark featured a replica of the Liberty Bell in the stands above the Diamond Club (representing Ameriquest's logo) that rang after home runs. In 2007, though, the Rangers announced the termination of the agreement with Ameriquest, and changed the name to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Club president Jeff Cogen cited that the team was more concerned about getting their name back on the ballpark than Ameriquest's public financial troubles. \\"It's all about the brand\\", Cogen said. The Rangers lost a reported $2.5 million per year from the lack of naming rights but regained advertising space given over to Ameriquest in the naming rights deal. Regardless of Cogen's comments, Ameriquest dissolved within months after the naming rights were terminated, and the company ended most business operations in September 2007. =2007–2009: Financial troubles= The Rangers struggled offensively early in the season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. On June 20, Sammy Sosa hit his 600th career home run against the Chicago Cubs at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Hank Blalock, the starting 3rd baseman who had been enjoying a good season, was placed on the 60-day disabled list on May 19 due to thoracic outlet syndrome, and Mark Teixeira followed him onto the disabled list on June9 (for the first time in his career) with a strained left quadriceps muscle. With a record of 46–59 at the July 31 trade deadline, the team traded Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay to the Atlanta Braves in a deal that would eventually bring five prospects to the Rangers organization, including four of Atlanta's top prospects Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Elvis Andrus, Matt Harrison, and Neftalí Feliz. The team also traded closer Éric Gagné to the Boston Red Sox for left-hander Kason Gabbard and Minor League outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre. These moves were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. The objective of Daniels' plan was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season. The 2007 season remains notable in the minds of baseball fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 30–3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League history—entering the game in the bottom of the seventh, with his team already ahead 14–3, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk. The Rangers began the 2008 season red hot, headlined by newcomer Josh Hamilton who looked to be a threat to win the Triple Crown, before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at Yankee Stadium, Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 Home Run Derby with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' Justin Morneau. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Josh Hamilton, Ian Kinsler, Milton Bradley, and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly. The Rangers would finish the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79–83), yet ended the season second in the West, the club's best finish since 1999. The off-season saw perennial All-Star shortstop Michael Young ask for a trade when the team told him he would be moving to third base to make room for rookie Elvis Andrus. After speaking with club president Nolan Ryan and his agent, Young later rescinded his trade request, and agreed to move to third base. The offseason also saw the departure of mercurial outfielder/DH Milton Bradley to free agency. Scott Feldman Derek Holland is considered the best pitching prospect drafted by the Rangers since the departure of John Danks The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and Ian Kinsler, the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87–75, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the A.L. West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth straight All-Star appearance. Josh Hamilton and Nelson Cruz were also named 2009 A.L. All-Stars. Several young stars with the club broke out including the debuts of highly rated rookies Elvis Andrus, Derek Holland, and Neftalí Feliz. Second baseman Ian Kinsler hit for the cycle in April, while having a 30–30 season in home runs and stolen bases. Starting pitcher Scott Feldman posted a fantastic season as well in 2009, finishing 3rd in the A.L in wins with 17. =New ownership= While the 2009 season was strong on the field, club owner Tom Hicks became the focus of several reports indicating serious financial problems with his holding group, Hicks Sports Group, which also owned the Dallas Stars, the Frisco RoughRiders (the Rangers AA-farm club), 1/2 of Liverpool F.C. (sold in mid-October 2010 to New England Sports Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox), and the Mesquite Championship Rodeo (later sold by HSG). HSG was reported to have gone into default on a $525 million loan. In April 2009, Hicks announced he would be willing to sell a minority interest in the team. Only one month later, Hicks announced he would be willing to sell majority control of the Rangers. In July 2009, it was reported that Hicks borrowed money from Major League Baseball to meet the team's payroll. After the 2009 season, Hicks began scouting prospective buyers and in December, entered into exclusive negotiating rights for sale of the Rangers with a consortium headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer Chuck Greenberg and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan. On January 22, 2010, Hicks Sports Group officially reached a formal agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan (later called Rangers Baseball Express) for approximately $570 million.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content;_id=7958194&vkey;=news_tex&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=tex&partnerId;=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized Under the provisions of the deal, former owner Hicks stayed on as a limited minority partner, but was not allowed to retain a seat on the board of governors. Co-lead investors Dallas businessmen Ray Davis, and Ft. Worth Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen. Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Rangers Baseball Express in a separate deal. The deal was subject to approval by the other MLB owners (a 3/4 vote is required) and completed by April 1. However, one of HSG's principal lenders (Monarch Alternative Capital) opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes. On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process. Because of public comments made by Hicks deemed detrimental to the process, MLB also stripped Hicks of any responsibility regarding the sale of the team. On May 13, MLB threatened to seize control of the rest of the team's operations if a deal was not completed by the deadline set by the Commissioner. As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, on May 24, 2010 the Texas Rangers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million. Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary. Officially, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez topped the list of unsecured creditors with an estimated $24.9 million owed by the Rangers. Additionally, the Rangers also owed Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Millwood $12.9 million, and current Rangers third baseman Michael Young $3.9 million. At a press conference, the Greenberg-Ryan group proposed to buy the team for $575 million. The sale would repay all the team's creditors, including players owed back salary. After several attempts to resolve the deal fell through, the bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held on August 4. The Greenberg/Ryan bid would be the opening bid, and other offers (subject to MLB approval) would have to be submitted by the prior day in order to be considered. At the auction, only one other MLB-approved group submitted an offer—Radical Baseball LLC, a group formed by Houston businessman Jim Crane (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Houston Astros) and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Chicago Cubs). The auction lasted until the early morning of August 5, with the winning bid submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. The bankruptcy court approved the bid later that morning and the bankruptcy case closed. The sale to the Greenberg/Ryan was approved by all 30 MLB owners at the owners meeting in Minneapolis on Thursday August 12. The new ownership group, which included Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan, was called Rangers Baseball Express, LLC and had Greenberg serving as managing general partner and Ryan as club president. Again, co-lead investors Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen. In March 2011, Greenberg resigned as Chief Executive and Managing General Partner and sold his interest in the club following a \\"falling out\\" with his partners. Following Greenberg's resignation, Ryan was named Chief Executive Officer in addition to his continuing role as team President. Ryan was subsequently designated the controlling owner of the club by a unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011. Co-Chairmen Simpson and Davis stated they would not be involved in day-to-day operations. 2010–present: Rise to contention = First pennant: 2010 = Offseason moves made by the Rangers sent Kevin Millwood to the Baltimore Orioles and acquired free agents Rich Harden, Colby Lewis, and Vladimir Guerrero. With the new influx of talent and success in 2009, the Rangers entered the season with expecting to compete for the division and achieve the front office's goals of 2007. During the offseason, Texas Rangers' team President Nolan Ryan spoke about the Rangers' chances in the upcoming season by saying, Ian Kinsler After stumbling out of the gates with a sub-.500 start in April, the Rangers took the division lead with a franchise-best month of June, going 21–6. The Rangers would never relinquish first place after an 11-game winning streak. On July 9, the club dealt one of its top prospects, Justin Smoak, with two other minor leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for former Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe. The Rangers also made moves to acquire veterans Bengie Molina, Jorge Cantú, Cristian Guzmán, and Jeff Francoeur. In the 2010 All-Star Game, the team was represented by Lee, Guerrero, Ian Kinsler, Josh Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, and Neftalí Feliz. After the All-Star Game, came the debut of the claw and antler hand gestures, which gained much popularity, especially after the release of various apparel and souvenir options for the fans. Foam claws and helmets with deer antlers became quite commonplace in the ballpark as the Rangers played further into the fall. The Rangers won the A.L. West on September 25, advancing to the postseason for the first time since 1999. = 2010 postseason = After winning the AL West with a 90–72 record, the Rangers entered the playoffs for the first time since 1999, and faced the Tampa Bay Rays for the first round, which ultimately resulted in a 3–2 series victory and marked the first postseason series victory in the 50-year history of the Rangers/Washington Senators franchise. Facing the Rangers in the American League Championship Series were the defending World Champion New York Yankees, the team the Rangers failed against three separate times in the 1990s. In the playoffs, the Rangers record against the Yankees was 1–9. In a 6-game series, the Texas Rangers came out victorious, winning the first Pennant in franchise history in front of an ecstatic home crowd. Josh Hamilton was awarded ALCS MVP after setting a series record for intentional walks. The Texas Rangers faced the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 World Series. The Rangers offense struggled against the Giants' young pitching and eventually lost the Series 4–1, the lone win coming in Arlington on October 30. For the first time, the Rangers ended their season in the month of November. = 2011: Repeat AL champions = The Rangers successfully defended their AL West Division title in 2011, making the club's second straight division title and postseason appearance and fifth division title and postseason appearance overall. The Rangers set records for best record (96-66 with a .592 winning percentage) and home attendance (2,946,949). On October 15, they went back to the World Series, beating the Detroit Tigers 15–5 in Game6 of the ALCS. The series featured Nelson Cruz hitting six home runs, the most home runs by one player in a playoff series in MLB history. In game two, Cruz also became the first player in postseason history to win a game with a walk-off grand slam as the Rangers defeated the Tigers 7–3 in 11 innings. However, they would proceed to lose the World Series in seven games to the Cardinals. = 2012: Staff changes = The Rangers did a lot of retooling in the 2011–2012 off season. Staff ace C. J. Wilson left the team to join the division rival Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels also upgraded their offense with the signing of Albert Pujols, causing more parity within the division. The Rangers responded by signing Yu Darvish of the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Central League in Nippon Professional Baseball of Japan. The team also converted closer Neftalí Feliz to a starting pitcher upon signing Joe Nathan to take over closing duties in the bullpen. The Rangers would not repeat as AL West champions, but would qualify for the postseason as the top wild card team in the AL. They would lose the wild game to the Orioles. = 2013-14: Missed postseasons = In 2013, the Rangers finished 91–71, which tied them with Tampa Bay for the final wild card position. The Rangers would lose the tie-breaker game to the Rays 5–2. In 2014, the Rangers slumped to their first losing season since 2008. Late in the season, manager Ron Washington resigned, citing personal reasons. = 2015-16: Back-to-back AL West champions = In 2015, under new manager Jeff Banister, the Rangers overcame a slow start to win the AL West. The club was aided by the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Cole Hamels. On the last day of the regular season, Hamels would pitch a complete game in a victory over the Angels that clinched the division for the Rangers. In the Division Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Rangers would win the first two games in Toronto, but then lose three straight to end their season. In 2016, the Rangers repeated as AL West champions with the best record in the AL. They would face the Blue Jays again in the ALDS. This time, the Blue Jays swept the series. = 2017: Missed postseason = With a returning top bullpen and new recruits, the Rangers had hopes of postseason success. However, they ended their 2017 season 78–84, and tied for 3rd in the AL West. = 2018: Staff changes = The Rangers finished their season 67–95, and finished 5th place in the AL West. With little success the previous seasons, Jeff Banister was fired as club manager. Rangers bench coach, Don Wakamatsu, was promoted to interim manager for the final games of the season. After the season concluded, the Rangers decided on Chris Woodward to be the new team manager. = 2019: Rebuilding = Globe Life Park in Arlington (2009) This season's opener was on March 28, and it acted as the final opening day game at the stadium. The final season at Globe Life Park (not to be confused with the new Globe Life Park) marked the end of an era. The club is set to move into the new stadium for the 2020 season. With the retirement of Adrian Beltre, numerous trades, and moving around of players, Elvis Andrus is the last player to connect the team to their 2011 World Series run. The Ranger's new manager, Chris Woodward, explains the direction of the 2019 season: The Rangers have not won a playoff game in three years, and sportsbook and casino, Caesars Palace, predicts a 67–95 season.

He is currently a Professor of Comparative Human Development, Evolutionary Biology, and Neurobiology at The University of Chicago. Background Maestripieri obtained a laurea in Biology in 1987 and a doctorate in Psychobiology in 1992 from the Università di Roma La Sapienza, in Italy. After spending one year as a Visiting Researcher at the Sub- department of Animal Behaviour of the University of Cambridge in the U.K., he moved to Emory University in Atlanta, U.S.A., where he worked at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center from 1992 to 1999. He has been a Professor at the University of Chicago since 1999. Research Maestripieri conducts research with rhesus macaques at the Caribbean Primate Research Center of the University of Puerto Rico as well as research with human subjects at the University of Chicago. His studies of nonhuman primates have addressed topics such as aggression and dominance, affiliation and social bonding, communication and cognition, mating and reproduction, and parenting and development. Some of his work has elucidated the neuroendocrine regulation of primate behavior while other research has investigated its evolutionary significance. Human research conducted in Maestripieri's laboratory at the University of Chicago has focused on three different areas: parent-child relationships, attachment, and socio-emotional development; neuroendocrine regulation of social processes and stress reactivity; evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics. Maestripieri has published six books, several popular science essays, and over 175 scientific articles. His books provide an illustration of his intellectual interests. Evolutionary Theory and Primate Behavior includes a collection of essays illustrating evolutionary analyses of major aspects of primate socioecology and behavior including feeding, social, and reproductive strategies. In Primate Psychology, Maestripieri integrates human and nonhuman primate research on many aspects of social behavior, development, communication and cognition. In Macachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World, he highlights the many parallels between the social behavior of rhesus macaques and human beings and explains them using evolutionary and economic cost-benefit analyses. He also suggests that complex political intelligence evolved in highly competitive primate societies played a role in the evolution of the human brain and human intelligence, as well as in our ecological success on this planet. Maternal Effects in Mammals is an edited collection of theoretical and empirical essays addressing the role of nongenetic maternal influences on phenotypic evolution in many species of mammals. In Animal Personalities: Behavior, Physiology, and Evolution, research on individual differences in behavior and reactivity to the environment in many animals and humans is discussed and integrated from a comparative and evolutionary perspective. In Games Primates Play: An Undercover Investigation of the Evolution and Economics of Human Relationships, Maestripieri illustrates how evolutionary and comparative studies, along with economic cost-benefit analyses of behavior, can explain why people behave the way they do in everyday social situations and in the negotiation of their personal and business relationships. Honors Dario Maestripieri was awarded the B. Grassi Prize as the Best Young Zoologist from the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Italy in 1989, the Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology from the American Psychological Association in 2000 and a Career Development Award from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2001. He has been elected Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science for sustained and outstanding distinguished contributions to psychological sciences, and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for distinguished contributions to the integrative study of animal behavior.

The series follows the exploits of recent New Jersey transplant Mondo and his new best friend Woodie as they live their life in Playa Del Toro, a fictional Southern California beach town. The show was originally sold to Fox in 2008, and a pilot produced. When Fox passed, the producers looked for other buyers and in 2010 they received a series order at MTV. On February 24, 2012, the series was cancelled after one season.Deadline: Animated Comedy ‘Good Vibes’ Cancelled By MTV After One Season Characters * Montgomery \\"Mondo\\" Brando (Josh Gad): Mondo is a young overweight teenage boy from Bayonne, New Jersey who is rather self-conscious and insecure about his looks. At first he kept to himself but after befriending Woodie, he begins to break out of his shell. He starts taking up surfing and develops a crush on Jeena who finally became his girlfriend. Mondo has never met his father; in \\"Mondo Mia!\\" we learn that his father was a \\"cleanup man\\" for the Mob who had to go on the run after witnessing something he shouldn't (two mobsters making out). He is Jeena's boyfriend. * Woodford \\"Woodie\\" Stone (Adam Brody): Woodie is Mondo's best friend. As opposed to Mondo who is short and fat, Woodie is tall and skinny. Woodie is a lazy, laid- back and hedonistic surfer. He hates doing any type of work and prefers to spend all of his days surfing. Woodie's family is incredibly rich, but he hates what material wealth has done to them and prefers to sleep in a bamboo hut outside the mansion. * Barbara \\"Babs\\" Brando (Debi Mazar): Babs is Mondo's mother, she has worked several jobs: her current job is waitressing at a Hawaiian restaurant. She is very attractive and has large breasts and is the object of Woodie's (and every other man's) desire. A running gag in the pilot was that she longed for a job where she didn't have to work a pole, be on her back, be on her knees, and so on, and then several jobs where she did these things were seen: fireman-pole cleaner, meter maid, factory worker, mechanic, etc. * Winthrop Aguilera Wadska (Tony Hale): Commonly referred to by his last name, Wadska is hyperactive, overly paranoid and somewhat psychotic. Wadska is known to engage in harmful and dangerous behavior and often gets Woodie and Mondo involved in some way. According to his sister Jeena he is on medication, possibly the reason behind his behavior. He also uses the Internet to prepare for both the apocalypse and college, whatever comes first to him. In every episode, his shirt has a different saying on it; similar to Frank's hats on 30 Rock. * Jeena Wadska (Olivia Thirlby): Jeena is a popular and attractive girl who is Mondo's crush after having a vision about their graduation, marriage, life, afterlife in Episode 1. She is a bit of a tomboy and is very nice and laid-back. She also likes Mondo but she has an on-and-off relationship with Turk; in \\"Red Tuxedo\\" she breaks up with Turk and begins dating Mondo. She is Wadska's sister and Mondo's girlfriend. * Dirk Kirk \\"Turk\\" Turkpatrick (Jake Busey): Turk is the resident tough guy. He is shown as a brash and unrefined bully often targets Mondo. However he has a very sensitive side and shown to be rather cowardly deep down. He used to date Milan and now has an on-and-off relationship with Jeena who later breaks up with him and starts dating Mondo. * Milan Stone (Kari Wahlgren): Milan is Woodie's sister. She is a mean, vapid, vain, pretentious, snobbish, selfish, promiscuous and spoiled celebrity heiress who stars in her own reality show on MTV titled \\"16 and Bitchy\\". She has breast implants (which are removable by zipper) and used to date Turk. Despite her spoiled and snobbish demeanor, it is revealed that prior to her family's wealthy lifestyle, she and her brother always played together at the beach when they were young kids and that she still secretly cherishes that. * Voneeta Teets (Danny McBride): The sex-ed teacher at Del Toro High. She is a bisexual who weighs 400 pounds and gets around in a motorized scooter, but she is immensely proud of her body and is insatiably horny. * Lonnie (Alan Tudyk): A hippie and Gulf War vet who lives in a van by the beach. He gives Mondo and Woodie advice, usually while stoned. * HJ & BJ Kuntz (Cree Summer): Identical twins who are Milan's friends/entourage. Episodes Reception Good Vibes received mixed reviews from critics. Some, like San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand found its writing to be \\"juvenile, hormonal and often pretty dang funny\\", while Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen branded it \\"aggressively dumb, sex-obsessed and occasionally misogynistic\\". In its review of the first season, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club criticized the pilot, praised later episodes and expressed optimism towards the series' future, mentioning that \\"this isn’t a recommendation exactly—there are still a few too many problems with the surface level of the show—but the undercarriage is sound, and it wouldn’t be surprising if this developed into a surprisingly sweet and winning little show given enough time\\". The show achieved a metascore of 58 on Metacritic and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 70%, with an average rating of 6.15/10. It was cancelled by MTV on February 24, 2012 due to low ratings.

Early life Daughter of Samuel and Luise Jacoby, she was born in Berlin on 9 December 1909. She soon showed her talent as a writer, when, in 1919, her essay on eastern European refugees was published in the Berliner Tageblatt and she was thanked personally by the editor, Theodor Wolff. After a brief period at the school of the Berlin State Theatre she worked as assistant to a photographer and then in the Workers' Theatre. Here she met left-wing economist Siegfried Moos, \\"Siege\\", whom she married in 1932. Emigration and travels After Hitler's rise to power in 1933 it was necessary for Lotte and Siege to flee Germany, and initially they settled in Paris, but soon moved to London. Lotte's ambition to study at LSE was frustrated by the fact that her German qualifications were not recognised. In 1936 the British government refused to renew her visa; she departed to the Soviet Union to join her friend Brian Goold-Verschoyle, and \\"to see what it was like\\". She soon became disillusioned with the Soviet system and succeeded in returning to Britain. The British authorities received 'information' from the Soviet defector Walter Krivitsky that she could be a spy, and she was arrested and interrogated by MI5 in Holloway Prison. She then was interned in the Isle of Man. Oxford and Durham On release from internment she rejoined her husband in Oxford, where he was working at the Institute of Statistics under William Beveridge. Lotte worked as a nursemaid, translator, typist and teacher, and under the pseudonym Maria Lehmann, she wrote a column for the British German-language newspaper, Die Zeitung. Shortly after the war ended Siege was appointed as a lecturer at Durham University, and the family, now with a baby daughter, moved to Durham. There Lotte took part in amateur dramatics and also wrote plays, still using the \\"Maria Lehmann\\" name. In May 1964 her play Come Back With Diamonds, a comedy about a released political prisoner returning to Moscow, was performed at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. London In 1966, Siegfried became an adviser to the Board of Trade, and he and Lotte moved to Hackney in London. Both of them wrote poetry at this time, and Lotte had three collections published. Some of her work also appeared in the anthology The New British Poetry (1988). Siegfried died in 1988; Lotte died on 3 January 2008 in London.

It declared itself the supreme authority of the Kingdom from June 18, 1808, during the Peninsular war and due to the abdication of the King, and until Galicia was conquered by the Napoleonic troops in 1809. History Initially the Xuntas Generales del Reino de Galicia was an assembly where representatives of the three states of the Kingdom (noblemen, churchmen, and the commoners) met. But soon it followed the evolution prompted by the King of Spain in other representative institutions, such as the Cortes of Castile, so becoming monopolized by the bourgeoisie and lesser nobility (fidalgos), who controlled most of the local councils of the cities and towns of the Kingdom, and at the expenses of Church and nobility. From 1599 the composition of the assembly became fixed and reduced to just seven deputies, each one representing one of the Kingdom provinces, and appointed by the council of the province's capital —Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Betanzos, Lugo, Mondoñedo, Ourense, and Tui— from among its members. Other towns, namely Viveiro and Pontevedra, tried during the 17th and 18th century to regain a direct representative in the assembly, to no effect. The Xunta, whilst having little direct intervention in law making, and not much control over the Royal administration,Only in few occasions the King permitted the deputies to supervise the labour of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia. Cf. . could nevertheless rise armies, ships and taxes, conceding or denying the King's petitions on behalf of all the local powers of the Kingdom; the assembly could also petition the King himself, this being the usual mean it used for modifying or approving laws, or for promoting the interests of the Kingdom. The Xunta was also recognized as the voice and representative of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will, traditions and rights (foros). Notwithstanding, the King never consented on the petition of the assembly to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly can only take place when in presence of one representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the Governor-Captain General of the Kingdom, so trying to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements. From the 18th century, with the advent of the absolutists Bourbon monarchs, the Xunta was gradually deprived of its powers.

In a career which lasted from summer 1924 until September 1925, Manna ran eight times, winning four races. As a three-year-old in 1925 he won the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and The Derby by a record margin of eight lengths. Manna was retired after breaking down in his bid to win the Triple Crown in the St. Leger at Doncaster. He later had a successful career at stud. Background Manna, described by the Breeders’ Review as \\"a superb creature\\" with whom it was \\"impossible to find fault\\", was a bay horse bred in Ireland by James J. Maher at his Confey Stud in County Kildare. As a yearling he was sent to the sales at Doncaster, where he was sold for 6,300 gns to the trainer Fred Darling acting on behalf of the Shanghai-based bullion broker Henry E. Morriss. Darling had been instructed by a telegram from Morriss to buy the best yearling in the sale. Manna was trained by Darling at his stable at Beckhampton in Wiltshire where he proved to be a lively and high-spirited individual. Manna was from the third crop of foals sired by Phalaris an outstanding sprinter who went on to become the most influential stallion of the 20th century. Manna's dam, the unraced mare Waffles, went on to produce the St. Leger winner Sandwich. Morriss later explained the colt's name by saying \\"I always felt that he was a Heaven-sent gift... and Waffles, his dam is the name of a food.\\" Racing career =1924: two-year-old season= Manna made his debut in one of the season's most important races for two-year- olds, the National Breeders’ Produce Stakes at Sandown for which, on the basis of his home reputation, he started odds-on favourite. He failed to win but showed himself to be a promising colt by finishing third to Garden of Allah. This promise was confirmed when he won the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood on his next start in July. At Kempton he finished second in the Imperial Produce Stakes to Picaroon, the year's champion two-year-old colt. He faced Picaroon again in the Middle Park Stakes. Manna took the lead in the final furlong but was outpaced in the last stages of the race and finished third behind Picaroon and Solario On his final start of the year, Manna beat Cross Bow to win the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket. =1925: three-year-old season= The spring of 1925 was unusually wet, leading to heavy ground on which it was difficult to prepare horses. Manna was not, therefore, believed to be in peak condition for the 2000 Guineas, and started at odds of 100/8 in a field of thirteen. Ridden by Steve Donoghue, Manna led from the start and won easily, beating St. Becan by two lengths. Manna was then aimed at the Derby although there were doubts about whether, as the son of a sprinter, he would have the stamina to be effective over one and a half miles on heavy ground. He started at odds of 9/1, with Cross Bow, who had won the Newmarket Stakes starting the 9/2 favourite. The race was run in \\"cold, driving rain\\" in front of a large crowd which included the King and Queen and other members of the Royal Family. Ridden confidently by Donoghue, Manna tracked the early leader, Dalmagarry, before moving to the front soon after half way. In the straight he pulled steadily further away from his rivals to win by eight lengths. The winning margin was the largest ever recorded in the race, and remained so until Shergar won by ten lengths in 1981. Although Manna had not been favourite, the win was reported to be enthusiastically received, largely because of the popularity of Donoghue, who was winning the race for the sixth time. After the race he explained that Manna had \\"shot to the front without any bidding from me\\" and that he had \\"never shown him the whip\\". Manna failed to reproduce his Derby winning form at Royal Ascot. In the King Edward VII Stakes he finished a close third when attempting to give ten pounds to Solario a colt who had finished fourth at Epsom. The result caused debate concerning the relative merits of Manna and Solario, with some correspondents expressing the view that Solario had been beaten in the Derby only through a lack of fitness. On his final start, Manna attempted to win the Triple Crown in the St. Leger for which he was made 7/2 joint-favourite with Solario. His task appeared to have been made much easier by the late withdrawal of the undefeated filly Saucy Sue who had won the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks. Manna looked \\"splendid\\" before the race and started strongly, leading the field in the early stages, but he was headed after a mile and dropped quickly out of contention. He finished tenth of the fifteen runners behind Solario, \\"limping\\", according to the Daily Telegraph, \\"like a tired old hound with thorns in his pads.\\" It was subsequently revealed that Manna had sustained an injury to his right foreleg which proved severe enough to end his racing career. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Manna an \\"average\\" Derby winner and the one hundred and fifteenth best British racehorse of the 20th century. Stud career For his stud career, Manna was syndicated (\\"turned into limited liablility company\\") by his owner, with the intention that his future should be managed on \\"efficient business lines\\". It was reported that his stud fee was likely to be 400 gns. Standing at the Banstead Manor Stud, at Cheveley, near Newmarket, Manna was a reasonably successful stallion with the best of his progeny being the 2000 Guineas winner Colombo and the undefeated Mannamead. His son Manitoba was one of leading British two-year-old of 1932 who went on to become an important stallion in Australia. He died after breaking a blood vessel in October 1939. He was buried at the Banstead Manor Stud, where the stallion man's cottage is still known as \\"Manna Cottage.\\" Pedigree *Manna was inbred 3x4x4 to St. Simon.

Little has been recorded about Eyles' early life, but he served for much of his time in the navy under the patronage of Sir John Borlase Warren, a prominent naval commander, who arranged for Eyles to have a significant role in the Quiberon Expedition in 1795. Success in this operation led to a promotion to post- captain, and command of his own frigate, the 44-gun . Eyles continued to served under Warren in the frigate squadron patrolling the Western Approaches, often captaining Warren's ships. Eyles saw action at the Battle of Tory Island in 1798, and later became Warren's flag captain after Warren's promotion and appointment to serve in the Channel Fleet. As one of the early commanders of , Eyles had to deal with a mutiny as disaffected sailors aired their grievances at being sent abroad as peace seemed imminent. The mutiny was put down and Eyles carried out his original mission, sailing to the West Indies, before returning to Britain. Eyles appears to have been unemployed for a time, only returning to command a ship in 1809, and moving to command one of the royal yachts shortly before his promotion to rear-admiral in 1814. He rose through the ranks, never hoisting his flag, until his death as a vice-admiral of the white in 1835, at the age of 66. Early career Combat de Quiberon en 1795, painting by Jean Sorieul. Though the expedition ultimately ended in failure, it brought Eyles to the Admiralty's attention, and resulted in his promotion to post-captain. Eyles was the son of Thomas Eyles of Stratton Audley, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Ann Woodward Baxter, and, in turn, the father of Major Thomas Woodward Eyles. Little is recorded about Eyles's early life and career in the navy. He was a protégé of Sir John Borlase Warren and was serving aboard Warren's ship, the 44-gun , during the Quiberon Expedition in mid-1795. Eyles was a lieutenant at this time, and did not have an active posting, but Warren lobbied the Admiralty to give Eyles a position on the expedition, and himself appointed Eyles to oversee all matters related to signalling and transportation. Encouraged by the expedition's initial success, the Admiralty promoted Eyles to post-captain on 13 July 1795 and Warren to commodore. Eyles received an appointment to command the Pomone, initially as acting captain, and later being confirmed as captain. The expedition ultimately ended in the frustration of the British plans to encourage a French Royalist rising, but Eyles and Warren both benefited from it. Command =With the frigate squadron= Pomone continued to serve under Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren as part of the frigate squadron in the Western Approaches, and Eyles played an important part in cruises with the squadron against enemy privateers and merchant shipping. Eyles narrowly lost his command in 1796 when, through the ignorance of her French pilot, Pomone ran aground off Nantes. She was damaged, but was able to be refloated. Warren sent her into port to be repaired, with the crew struggling to keep her afloat on the voyage to Plymouth. Eyles managed to get her into port safely, and received the thanks of the Admiralty for saving the ship. Sir John Borlase Warren, by Daniel Orme, 1799. Warren was an enduring patron of Eyles, who served under him on a number of different ships. Eyles remained in command until 1797, capturing either singly, or in company with other vessels, a large number of privateers, including the 8-gun cutter Sans Peur on 13 March 1796, and on 20 March 1796 captured the Etoile and four vessels in a convoy off Pointe du Raz, on the Brittany coast. The capture of the 14-gun Fantaisie off Morlaix followed on 25 May 1796. On 22 August 1796 Eyles was in company with several frigates and smaller ships when the French 36-gun Andromache was spotted making for the Gironde estuary. The 32-gun , under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, and the brig , made French signals to fool the French ship into anchoring. On discovering her mistake, the French ship attempted to escape, pursued by Galtaea, Pomone and . After a sustained chase, the Andromache ran herself aground, and was later boarded and burnt by boats from the British squadron. Further successes that Eyles had a hand in included the running of the French 28-gun Calliope onto the Penmarcks on 16 July 1797, an attack on a convoy escorted by the 20-gun Réolaise and other ships on 11 August 1797, and engagements with the Egalité on 23 August and the 18-gun cutter Petit Diable on 27 August 1797. Eyles left Pomone in late 1797, being succeeded by Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. Eyles took command of the 74-gun , flying the broad pennant of Commodore Warren, and under him saw action at the Battle of Tory Island, in which a French invasion force under Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart was encountered and successfully dispersed on 12 October 1798. The Brest blockade Eyles association with Warren continued after Warren's promotion to rear-admiral. When Warren hoisted his flag aboard the 98-gun , Eyles came with him, succeeding Temeraires previous commander, Captain Peter Puget, in July 1799. The newly commissioned Temeraire then joined the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Lord Bridport and supported the blockade of the French port of Brest, making several long cruises of two or three months at a time patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by Temeraires former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month Temeraire became the flagship of Rear-Admiral James Whitshed. Eyles continued to serve with Warren, with his next posting as captain of Warren's new flagship, the 74-gun . Eyles was aboard her until November 1800. He then returned after a period of absence to resume command of Temeraire on 31 August 1801. Rear-Admiral Whitshed had struck his flag by now, and in his place Temeraire became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Campbell. By this time the Second Coalition against France had collapsed, and negotiations for peace were underway at Amiens. Lord St Vincent had been promoted to First Lord of the Admiralty, and command of the Channel Fleet passed to Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. Anticipating the imminent end of the war, Temeraire was taken off blockade duty and sent to Bantry Bay to await the arrival of a convoy, which she would then escort to the West Indies. Many of the crew had been serving continuously in the navy since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had looked forward to returning to England now that peace seemed imminent. On hearing rumours that instead they were to be sent to the West Indies, a group of around a dozen men began to agitate for the rest of the crew to refuse orders to sail for anywhere but England. =Mutiny= The first open clash between the mutineers and officers came on the morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear-Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. Trouble flared up again when the mutineers, believing they would be supported by the majority of the crew, again made their refusal to sail to the West Indies known, and began to agitate against the officers. Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the following day and after a period of tensions and standoffs between the officers and the crew, the mutiny collapsed when the marines obeyed orders to arrest the ringleaders. Temeraire was ordered to Spithead and an investigation was carried out, which eventually saw the court-martial and punishment of the mutiny's ringleaders. After deliberations, twelve were sentenced to be hanged, the remaining two were to receive two hundred lashes each. Having carried out the executions, Temeraire was immediately sent to sea, and Eyles sailed for Barbados, arriving there on 24 February, and the ship remained in the West Indies until the summer. During her time there the Treaty of Amiens was finally signed and ratified, and Temeraire was ordered back to Britain. She arrived into Plymouth on 28 September and Eyles paid her off on 5 October. Later service Eyles does not appear to have had any more commands until early 1809, when he was appointed to command the 74-gun , which he did until early 1812. He was given command of the royal yacht HMY Royal Charlotte in early 1813, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 4 July 1814. He was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral of the white in May 1825. He died at this rank on 29 September 1835, at Loddington Hall, Northamptonshire, at the age of 66, having never hoisted his flag. Notes a. A number of general histories, including Goodwin's The Ships of Trafalgar and Noel Mostert's The Line on the Wind, state that all 14 were hanged. Willis studied contemporary records and reports of the court-martial for his The Fighting Temeraire, and states only 12 of the 14 were sentenced to be hanged. Roy and Lesley Adkins offer a third account, that twenty mutineers were tried, all were found guilty and eighteen were sentenced to death, the other two were to receive one hundred and twenty lashes each. They note that at least six were hanged and possibly as many as twelve, the remainder may have had their sentences commuted to transportation.

Definition  The concept of shared historical authority is defined by the premise that traditional institutions of historical authority, such as museums and historical societies, are increasingly inviting non-professionals (the general public) to share their historical viewpoints and experiences with the public. It is argued that this trend toward sharing authority is changing the nature of public historical experience in significant ways. Shared authority removes the hierarchy commonly practiced within cultural institutions. Moving away from a top down approach, shared authority is geared towards collaboration that includes dialogue, and participatory engagement. Typical examples of shared historical authority include: * A museum inviting a community artist to create and install a work of historically inspired public art on their site. * A historical society providing gallery space for community groups to display their own exhibitions. * Web-based projects that invite and display user-generated components. * Using oral and written histories contributed by individuals outside the strictly academic community in conjunction with more traditional scholarly essays, text panels or exhibit labels. * A historic house tour where visitors are encouraged to explore on their own and draw their own conclusions. * Community curation - \\"crowdsourcing\\" related content from subaltern groups In each case the institution serves as a catalyst for non-traditional participants to contribute to a body of information presented to the public. The institution uses its resources - e.g. staff expertise, collections, public space - to help non-traditional participants share their contributions in publicly accessible and engaging ways. At its most basic, shared authority turns people who would otherwise be historical consumers (visitors and audiences) into participants and co-generators of historical content for public display. Museums who coordinate programs that share historical authority often wish to imbue a sense of democratization to the historical narrative, in contrast to the top- down historical narratives that sometimes emerge in museums. In addition, shared authority projects frequently try to involve communities who have traditionally been disenfranchised or underrepresented in historical narratives and institutions, providing a platform for alternative voices to engage in a public historical dialogue. The role of shared historical authority continues to be debated in the field of public history.  History of the idea  The need for museums and other historical institutions to \\"share authority\\" with their audiences and surrounding communities is rooted in the ideologies of New Social History and social constructivism. Both paradigms reject the concept of a \\"master narrative\\" for describing historical events, finding it an inadequate method for representing the multiple experiences and perspectives of individuals involved. Arising from the work of folklorists such as John Lomax and Alan Lomax, New Deal-era Works Progress Administration (WPA) programs such as the Federal Writers' Project and the work of Studs Terkel, the social history movement of the 1960s placed new academic emphasis on the experiences of people not represented in traditional or \\"official\\" historical narratives, and gave further impetus to projects focused on collecting and sharing those experiences. Michael Frisch, a professor at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, popularized the term \\"shared authority\\" in his 1990 book A Shared Authority: Essays on the Craft and Meaning of Oral and Public History. In recent years, Frisch has distinguished between \\"sharing authority\\" and \\"a shared authority.\\" The former suggests that historians possess authority and have a responsibility to share it, reinforcing a traditional, top-down view of history. \\"A shared authority\\", by contrast, recognizes that traditional historical authorities and the public share in the interpretive and meaning- making process \\"by definition.\\" Beginning in the early 2000s, the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies that allow users to easily create and share content on digital platforms offered historical institutions a variety of new tools to facilitate public participation. Case studies The Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York's Manhattan district is a good example of how an urban museum can share historical authority Other examples of shared historical authority include StoryCorps, the City of Memory, and Philaplace, an internet-based neighborhood history project produced by the Historical Society of Philadelphia that combines scholarly essays with stories from anyone who cares to submit one. Staff members then curate the submitted stories. Dennis Severs House is a historic townhouse in London (18 Folgate St.) that was restored by Dennis Severs. The house is filled with historic objects alongside modern touches, sound clips of carriages and crying babies, and plates of real food set out each day by the staff. Visitors are encouraged to roam the house on their own, sit down on the furniture, interact with other visitors, and draw their own conclusions. The experience is meant to blur the lines between art and history. The Lower East Side Tenement Museum is the first museum to focus on the lives of urban, immigrant tenement dwellers. It shares authority by inviting the families of former residents to contribute objects, photographs, documents, interviews, and oral histories to the museum tours. Part of the museum's mission is to address today's immigrant issues. This provides another avenue for sharing authority through public programs that connect speakers with varied backgrounds to public audiences. The museum invites sharing on one of its tours, Sweatshop Workers, with the words: : \\"Spend extended time inside the Levine and Rogarshevsky apartments and join in a discussion about themes arising from the tour. Share your experiences, thoughts, and family histories with your educator and fellow visitors.\\" Open House: If These Walls Could Talk is an exhibition that was produced by the Minnesota Historical Society in 2006. The exhibition traced the stories of families in a single house in St. Paul, Minnesota between 1888 and 2006. The curators did not want to show patterns or people as part of aggregate groups. Instead, they chose to emphasize singularity and individuality. To accomplish this, the Minnesota Historical Society built a house for visitors to walk through. Instead of reading large panels of wall texts, visitors had to interact with objects to hear, read, or see the information. Unlike projects in which the content is produced in conjunction with a group of community members, here authority was shared at the level of narrative creation. Curators controlled the objects in the house, recordings of former residents, and the setup of the space. Without an overarching structure, visitors could wander through at random, co-creating their own narratives. There was no clear beginning and end beyond entering and exiting the house.Filene, B.

Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World. in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.), Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World, pp. 138-155. Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. The Black Bottom Performance Project is a partnership between the University of Pennsylvania and residents of Black Bottom, a historically black neighborhood destroyed by urban renewal policies and the University of Pennsylvania's expansion in the 1960s. Billy Yalowitz, a theater professor working at the university, invited Penn students as well as student and teacher partners from University City High School—a school built in the former Black Bottom neighborhood—and former residents of the neighborhood to work together on the telling of the neighborhood's history, ultimately creating \\"Black Bottom Sketches\\" in 1998.Yalowitz, B. (2011). \\"The Black Bottom: Making Community-Based Performance in West Philadelphia.\\" in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.), Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World, pp. 156-173. Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. The Wing Luke Museum is an example of a museum in which shared authority is a core component of its programming policies. The Humanities Truck is an experimental mobile platform for collecting, exhibiting, preserving, and expanding the dialogue around the humanities in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The project, which is sponsored by American University and is initially funded through a generous grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, enables partnerships with local organizations to collect people’s stories on critical issues, such as immigration and homelessness. The truck is fitted with a recording studio, mobile workshop space, and a gallery for pop-up exhibits that features built- in speakers, a flat-screen television, a roll-down screen and projector, and even an outside exhibit wall. Humanities Truck project fellows share historical authority with the communities with which they work. Criticism Despite the interest and affirmation that sharing authority is currently receiving in museum and public humanities circles, there are scholars and practitioners who criticise the practice. Generally, these criticisms are aimed at one of two levels. First, some scholars suggest that the phrase itself is wrong. \\"Sharing authority\\" implies that the process is something museums/archives do rather than something that just \\"is.\\" In his essay for Letting Go?, Michael Frisch suggests that a more appropriate formulation of the concept is \\"a shared authority.\\" :\\"a shared authority\\"... suggests something that 'is'-- that in the nature of oral and public history, we are not the sole interpreters. Rather, the interpretive and meaning-making process is in fact shared by definition-- it is inherent in the dialogic nature of an interview, and in how audiences receive and respond to exhibitions and public history interchanges in general.Frisch in Letting Go?, p. 127. Scholars and artists also worry that sharing authority devalues the hard-won expertise of professionals. The artist Fred Wilson, whose 1992-1993 exhibit \\"Mining the Museum\\" at the Maryland Historical Society is considered a landmark moment in museums' assessments of their role as historical arbiters, has expressed, \\"I don't think people should share authority to the degree that you devalue your own scholarship, your own knowledge. That's not sharing anything. You're not giving what you have. That is highly problematic. You have to be realistic about your years of experience, what you can give, and what others can give.\\" Further reading * Adair, Bill, Benjamin Filene and Laura Koloski.

It is most notable as being among the first phones to have an internal antenna.https://www.wired.com/2009/03/gallery-cell- phone-history/ It was designed to be the flagship and the most luxurious of all Nokia phones at the time, and also one of the first phones with chrome plating. Core features =Memory= The phonebook can store up to 250 names and numbers. Ten text messages can be stored on the internal memory. Contacts can also be stored on the SIM card, which allows the user to keep a backup should they accidentally delete their contacts from the internal phone memory. The phone does not have, however, any external memory options such support for a microSD card or Sony memory card. =Calls= The call history of the 8810 stores 30 previous calls: 10 dialed, 10 received and 10 missed. There are 35 preloaded monophonic ringtones on the phone and additional ringtones are available for download at a cost. The phone features the ability to make conference calls, hold calls and send DTMF tones. However, the phone does not feature a built in loudspeaker, which was unusual considering many lower quality phones which did not fall into the same price bracket as the Nokia 8810 were built with loudspeakers. =Display and input= The Nokia 8810 has a five line monochrome graphic display. Features include dynamic font size and soft key. =Connectivity= Besides the standard 2G network, the 8810 also features an infrared port, which was later adopted into other Nokia high-end phones. =Messaging= The phone uses SMS with T9 predictive text input, with support for major European languages. Messages can be up to 160 characters long. Compatible phones can send and receive picture messaging in Nokia standard Smart Messaging, not in later (universal) EMS. The phone can receive network operator logos and ringtones (up to five). Due to the lack of multimedia support for the phone, the Multimedia Messaging Service is not available on this phone. Similarly, email is also not supported. =Battery= The 8810 has two options for the battery: 600 mAh Ni-Mh or 400 mAh Lithium. The Ni-Mh is considered the standard battery and the lithium is the extended battery. The standard battery provides from 30 minutes to 1 hour talk time and 15–60 hours stand-by time, whereas the extended battery provides 1 hour 40 minutes – 2 hours 50 minutes talk time and 36–133 hours stand-by time. =Applications= The Nokia 8810 has a calculator which was an advanced feature in 1998, but a simple and basic feature by today's standards. It also has a currency converter which enables the user to convert one currency to another. This is also very basic, however, as the user is required to enter the exchange rate and can only enter one currency at a time, something which is very basic in comparison to today's mobile devices. Finally, the Nokia 8810 has a calendar which allows the user to store notes as well as make appointments for meetings and birthdays. The user can also use the infrared technology within the phone to send and exchange information between a computer or even another Nokia device. Other features The Nokia 8810 weighs 118 g with the standard battery and 98 g with the lithium battery. Its dimensions are 107×46×18 mm. The phone contains a few extra features: a clock, an alarm, and the popular game Snake. The phone is able to display any of 32 different languages. Vibration is an option for alerting the user to an event, for example receiving a text or reaching the time of an alarm. The 8810 is able to be used with Carbon Copy 5.0, which is a remote access program used for controlling a computer via a dial-up modem connection. Like all Nokia phone models, the 8810 has the option to change the 'profile'. This means that the user can select the volume and melody for tones such as the message tone, the ringing tone and the keypad tone, to name a few. There are also security features available on the Nokia 8810, such as a PIN code request and a call barring service. Design and reception In 1998, the Nokia 8810 was considered a luxury phone. This was due to the sleek new design the 8810 presented. It had no external whip or stub antenna, which was unusual for the time. Instead, it featured an internal antenna, which allowed the phone to be stored in a pocket upside down.http://www.uselog.com/2009/04/how-technology- improves-usability- nokia.htmlhttps://www.wired.com/culture/design/magazine/17-03/dp_cellphone Nokia invested hundreds of man hours into research on how people hold their phones for calls; this allowed them to place the antenna accordingly.http://www.dailytech.com/Nokia+RIM+Return+Fire+After+Apples+iPhone+4+Antennagate+Driveby/article19067.htm The 8810 is tapered and weighted to encourage users to hold it below the antenna, minimizing interference. However, this also led to a poorer signal reception compared to an external antenna, which meant battery life was reduced. It was encased entirely in plastic parts; this case would slide down to reveal the keypad. This new appearance, in particular the lack of an external antenna, meant the 8810 had a desirable advantage over its competitors and enjoyed moderate success.http://www.service- innovation.org/?p=508 The choice to make the antenna internal had a negative effect on battery life, but Nokia felt this was an acceptable tradeoff for getting rid of the external antenna. The design of the phone also made it particularly popular following its release. Unlike most other phones in the market at the time, the Nokia 8810 featured a chrome metal finish as well as a pull down metal slide which covered the keypad and kept it clean. Nokia claimed to prioritize antenna performance over physical design if they were ever in conflict.http://www.pluggd.in/scribefire-for-firefox-297/ References External links *http://www.phonesir.com/Nokia_8810_manual.html# *http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-8810 *http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8810-20.php 8810 ","title":"Nokia 8810"},{"id":"33692030","text":"Wards of Faerie is a fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks.

Facts  The appellant, Afrox Healthcare, was the owner of a private hospital. The respondent, Strydom, had been admitted to the hospital for surgery and post-operative medical treatment. On his admission, the parties concluded an agreement, of which it was a tacit term, according to Strydom, that Afrox's nursing staff would treat him in a professional manner and with reasonable care. The admission document, however, signed by Strydom during his admission to the hospital, contained an exemption clause, providing that he > absolved the hospital and/or its employees and/or agents from all liability > and indemnified them from any claim instituted by any person (including a > dependant of the patient) for damages or loss of whatever nature (including > consequential damages or special damages of any nature) flowing directly or > indirectly from any injury (including fatal injury) suffered by or damage > caused to the patient or any illness (including terminal illness) contracted > by the patient whatever the cause/causes are, except only with the exclusion > of intentional omission by the hospital, its employees or agents. After the operation, certain negligent conduct by a nurse led to complications which caused Strydom to suffer damages. Strydom argued that this conduct amounted to a breach of contract and instituted an action holding Afrox responsible for the damages.  Arguments  Afrox relied on the exemption clause to avoid liability for Strydom's damages. Strydom, in response, advanced several reasons why the provisions of the clause could not operate against him, contending * that it was contrary to the public interest; * that it was in conflict with the principles of good faith or bona fides; and * that it had been the legal duty of the admission clerk to draw his attention to the relevant clause. This had not been done. The grounds on which Strydom based his reliance on the public interest were # the alleged unequal bargaining positions of the parties at the conclusion of the contract; # the nature and ambit of the conduct of the hospital personnel for which liability was excluded; and # the fact that Afrox was the provider of medical services. Strydom alleged that, while it was Afrox's duty as a hospital to provide medical treatment in a professional and caring manner, the relevant clause went so far as to protect it from even gross negligence on the part of its nursing staff. This was contrary to the public interest. Strydom argued further that the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa obliges every court, when developing the common law, to promote the spirit, purport and object of the Bill of Rights.s 39(2). In considering the question of whether or not a particular contractual term conflicts with the public interest, account must be taken of the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution. Strydom argued that the relevant clause conflicted with the spirit, purport and object of the constitutional guarantee of every person's right to medical care,s 27(1)(a). and as such was in conflict with the public interest. In the alternative, Strydom contended that, even if the clause was not in conflict with the public interest, it was still unenforceable, because unreasonable, unfair and in conflict with the principle of bona fides or good faith. As a further alternative, he argued that he had, when signing the admission document, been unaware of the provisions of the clause. The evidence was that he had signed the document without reading it, even though he had had an opportunity to do so, but Strydom contended that the admission clerk had had a legal duty to inform him of the content of the clause and had failed to do so. Strydom's reason for alleging such a duty was that he did not expect a provision of that kind to be found in an agreement with a hospital. A Provincial Division found for Strydom.  Judgment  In an appeal, the SCA held that, as far as exclusionary and indemnity clauses were concerned, the common legal approach is that they should be interpreted restrictively. The fact that such clauses are generally held to be operative does not mean that a specific exclusionary clause cannot be declared contrary to public policy and as such unenforceable. The standard to be applied in respect of exclusionary clauses is no different from that applicable to other contractual terms which are invalid as a result of considerations of public policy. The question is whether upholding the relevant clause or other term would conflict with the interests of the public as a result of extreme unfairness or other policy issues.Paras 9-10. The court found, however, that there was no evidence indicating that Strydom had indeed occupied a weaker bargaining position than Afrox during the conclusion of the contract,Para 12. and that he had not relied on gross negligence on the part of Afrox's nursing staff in his pleadings. The question of whether the contractual exclusion of a hospital's liability for damages caused by the gross negligence of its nursing staff was in conflict with the public interest was accordingly not relevant to the instant matter; furthermore, even if that were the case, it would not entail the automatic invalidity of the relevant clause. The provisions would probably rather have been restricted to exclude gross negligence.Para 13. With regard to the constitutional argument, the court held that it had first to be decided whether section 39(2) of the Constitution empowered and obliged the Court to consider constitutional provisions not yet in operation when the contractual relationship between the parties had commenced. The agreement had been concluded in August 1995, whereas the Constitution had only become operative in February 1997. With regard to direct damages, the Constitution had no restrospectivity. Conduct which was valid when it was committed was accordingly not rendered retrospectively invalid as a result of the direct application of the Constitution. The question, however, surrounding the possible retrospective influence of the Constitution in an indirect manner, as envisioned in section 39(2), had not been pertinently decided; it was unnecessary, though, to try to answer that question in the present matter. For the purposes of the judgment, it was accepted in favour of Strydom that the provisions of section 27(1)(a) of the Constitution had to be taken into account, even though the section had not been operative at the time of the conclusion of the relevant agreement.Para 17. In considering the question of whether or not a particular contractual provision was in conflict with the interests of the community, the values underpinning the Constitution had to be taken into account.Para 18. The elementary and basic general principle was that it was in the public interest that contracts entered into freely and seriously, by parties having the necessary capacity, should be enforced. Strydom's contention—that a contractual term in which a hospital could exclude liability for the negligent conduct of its nursing staff was not in the public interest—could accordingly not be supported.Paras 23-24. It appeared from the judgment of the court a quo that it had been of the opinion that the principles of stare decisis as a general rule did not apply to the application of section 39(2) of the Constitution. That opinion was, at least as far as post-constitutional decisions were concerned, clearly incorrect.Para 26. As far as pre-constitutional decisions of the SCA regarding the common law were concerned, a distinction had to be drawn between three situations which could develop in the constitutional context: # where the High Court was convinced that the relevant rule of the common law was in conflict with a constitutional provision, in which case the court was obliged to depart from the common law, as the Constitution was the supreme law; # where the pre-constitutional decision of the SCA was based on considerations such as boni mores or public interest, in which case, if the High Court was of the view, taking constitutional values into account, that such a decision no longer reflected the boni mores or public interest, it was obliged to depart from the decision, which would not be in conflict with the principles of stare decisis, as it had to be accepted that boni mores and considerations of public policy were not static concepts; and # where a rule of the common law, determined by the SCA in a pre-constitutional decision, was not in direct conflict with any specific provision of the Constitution, where the decision was also not reliant on any changing considerations such as boni mores, but where the High Court was nevertheless convinced that the relevant common-law rule, upon the application of section 39(2), had to be changed to promote the spirit, purport and object of the Constitution—in which case the principles of stare decisis still applied and the High Court was not empowered by the provisions of section 39(2) to depart from the decisions of the SCA, whether such decisions were pre- or post-constitutional.Paras 27-29. Although abstract considerations such as good faith or bona fides were the basis and reason for the existence of legal rules, and also led to the creation and amendment of those rules, the court held they were not in themselves legal rules. When it came to the enforcement of contractual terms, the Court had no discretion and did not operate on the basis of abstract ideas; it operated on the basis of established legal rules.Para 32. The court found further that a person who signed a written agreement without reading it did so at his own risk and was consequently bound by the provisions contained therein as if he were aware of them and had expressly agreed thereto. There were exceptions, such as in the event of a legal duty to point out certain of the provisions in the contract,Paras 34-35. but Strydom's subjective expectations about the content of the agreement played no role in the question of whether a legal duty rested on the admission clerk to point out the content of the exclusionary clause to him. What was important was whether or not such a provision was, objectively speaking, unexpected. Today, the court found, exclusionary clauses in standard contracts were the rule rather than the exception. There was no reason in principle to differentiate between private hospitals and other service providers. The relevant clause in the admission document was accordingly not, objectively speaking, unexpected. The admission clerk had accordingly had no legal duty to bring it to Strydom's attention, and Strydom was bound by the terms of the clause as if he had read and had expressly agreed to it.Para 36. The appeal was thus upheld and the decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division in Strydom v Afrox Healthcare Bpk reversed.

This unique building takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners. The building was the guard house or garden retreat. It is the oldest building in Seville in the neomudéjar style. The name comes from a popular tradition that Mercedes of Orléans, the future wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain, retired to the pavilion where she passed her time sewing. The reality is more prosaic. The formal name is the \\"Pavilion of San Telmo\\". Mercedes died of typhus about fifteen years before the building was erected in 1893. Nowadays the Costurero de la Reina lodges the tourist information office on the ground floor. The opening times are 9-2 pm and 3.30 to 7.30 pm, on weekdays and 10-2pm during weekends and bank holidays. The building was restored in the spring of 2007 to repair the main structure and to arrange the interior in order to make it more functional. The first floor was refurbished recently and it is used as meetings and events room of the local government.  History  In the 19th century Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, he settled to live in the Palacio de San Telmo of Seville (today the seat of the Government of the Junta of Andalusia). The enormous gardens of the Palace would be adapted according to the romantic tastes. In 1893 is built in the area of the gardens near the Guadalquivir river a small tower for the guard, being the architect Juan Talavera and de la Vega (father of the regional architect Juan Talavera y Heredia). It is the first Neo-Mudéjar building in Seville, being able to appreciate the Arabic style in the large windows. In 1890 the Duke of Montpensier dies and in 1893 his wife, Luisa Fernanda of Bourbon, cedes the gardens of the Palace to the city of Seville. After this, there is a small extension to the north that will continue to be the private garden of the Palacio de San Telmo, most of the gardens would become the María Luisa Park and the castle and a small extension of the surrounding garden would be enclosed. The area is populated with other neomudéjars buildings, such as the Plaza de España, on the occasion of the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 .  Costurero de la Reina as Seville Tourist Office  It is currently used as the Tourist Information Office of the Seville City Council. Seville Tourism Office Hours: 9 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. Weekends and holidays attend visitors to the city from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. More information on the page of [Turismo de Sevilla, visitasevilla.es] In addition to its functions as Municipal Tourist Information Office on the ground floor, the first floor has been set up as tourism administrative units. The Costurero de la Reina inspired the portal of the Seville Fair of the year 2008.  Sevillian Legend  It is a historical fact that in 1878 the daughter of the Duke of Montpensier, Maria de las Mercedes of Orléans, married the King Alfonso XII of Spain, becoming queen consorte of Spain. However, it enters into its legends that the queen María de las Mercedes, due to her delicate health, spent long periods in the chambers of the castle basking in the sun while sewing with her ladies and also that, in those moments, she received visits from Alfonso XII, who came on horseback from the Alcázar of Seville after attending to his state affairs. This, however, would be impossible, because the building was built in 1893 and the queen died in 1878.

Background In 1978 Orson Welles directed Filming Othello. That film had mostly consisted of a monologue in which Welles discussed his 1952 adaptation of Othello. Encouraged by the result, he set out to make a similar documentary/essay film looking back at his own film of The Trial. Filming In 1981, Welles gave a 90-minute question-and-answer session at the University of Southern California after a screening of The Trial. He had his cinematographer Gary Graver film the session with a view to editing highlights of the footage into the projected film. Graver observed, \\"A lot of people were there in the audience that day who are successful filmmakers now\\", as well as several noted film critics such as Joseph McBride and Todd McCarthy. However, Welles never got round to editing the raw footage. Its only use in Welles' lifetime was by BBC journalist Leslie Megahy for his 1982 Arena documentary on Welles; specifically, the documentary features a young man asking Welles whether he would agree he has been persecuted by The Establishment and the capitalist system, and Welles being somewhat bemused by the question. Revival of the footage After Orson Welles' death in 1985, all of his unfinished films were bequeathed to his long-term companion and mistress Oja Kodar, and she in turn donated many of them (including Filming 'The Trial') to the Munich Film Museum for preservation and restoration. In the 2000s, the Munich Film Museum then edited together the complete footage into an 82-minute cut of the Q&A; session. Since Graver had to change film cartridges approximately every 10 minutes, this created breaks in filming, which are noticeable in the final cut. The restored footage has been screened at various film festivals, but has never been released on video or DVD. However, since the work is in the public domain, it is available on YouTube in its full length.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbUe-bM6bXg References  External links  * * Interview with Gary Graver Category:Unreleased films Category:1980s unfinished films Category:Films directed by Orson Welles Category:Documentary films about films ","title":"Filming The Trial"},{"id":"33692154","text":"Socrates is an outdoor sculpture by artist W.

Raffles and Co. was a large clothing and textile factory in the mid-20th century in Ancoats, Manchester. Founded by Emanuel Raffles, it employed as many as a thousand workers. The factory occupied part of Brunswick Mill at 2 Bradford Road, Manchester as well as the neighbouring EMKA Works towards Beswick Road (now mostly demolished). Raffles had cutting rooms in the upper section of Brunswick Mill where the pattern cut cloth was fed by carousel and conveyor to the sewing rooms in the lower section of the adjacent building. The Raffles family sold the business in the 1970s and it closed in the early 1980s. The kindness of Emanuel, known as 'Old Man Raffles' is referred to in Jeanette Winterson's book 'Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?'. The book also mentions the high quality of clothing produced at Raffles, enabling it to become the main supplier of raincoats to Marks & Spencer. Emanuel Raffles was one of the founders of Manchester's Whitefield Golf Club in 1932, set up as a reaction to the anti-semitism of most other golf clubs but open to non-Jews. His sons Ralph and Eric both worked at the factory. Ralph, married to the daughter of Marks & Spencer's Edward Sieff, was appointed High Sheriff of Greater Manchester. Eric, a keen aviator, commuted between Heathrow and Manchester Ringway in the 1960s and early 1970s in his private aircraft.

Part of the Tamar estuary also forms the Tamar Estuary Nature Reserve, owned by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The site was designated in 1991 for its biodiversity and varying habitats that support many wader and wildfowl species, as well as the special interest of its marine biology. Geography The SSSI encompasses the entirety of the tidal regions of the Tamar; from Gunnislake down to the Tamar Bridge in the south, where it forms the Hamoaze, and the River Tavy from Lopwell to its discharge in the Tamar. The site also includes Kingsmill Lake, Tamerton Lake and a few other tributary streams of the Tamar, as well as the marshes around Morwellham Quay. The site forms part of the Tamar Estuaries Complex Special Protection Area (SPA), along with the estuary of the River Lynher and St John's Lake, as well as forming part of the Plymouth Sound and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Cornwall Wildlife Trust owns the Tamar Estuary nature reserve around Kingsmill Lake, below Landulph,Ordnance Survey: Explorer map sheet 108 Lower Tamar Valley & Plymouth and Lopwell Dam is a Local Nature Reserve, covering the dam and surrounding woodlands. Wildlife and ecology The SSSI, due to its habitats, is of international importance for nature conservation, in particular as a wintering site for wildfowl and wader birds. Mudflats form the lower reaches of the estuary system and are bordered by salt marsh, inundation grassland and rocky shoreline habitats. These mainly contain common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima), red fescue and sea couch, as well as two nationally scarce species of grass: stiff saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia rupestris) and bulbous foxtail. The upstream part of the system supports freshwater marsh, fen, rush pasture and reedmarsh habitats, along with wooded valleys in places. Species include the common reed and the only known population in the British Isles of triangular club-rush, part of the genus Schoenoplectus. The mudflats attract more than 20% of the British wintering population of the uncommon pied avocet. They additionally support black-tailed godwit, common redshank, dunlin, whimbrel, greenshank, spotted redshank and green sandpiper during the wintering period, with the first birds arriving in October and leaving again throughout March. The highly variable salinity along the transition from marine estuary to river allows for a diverse marine culture. Seaweeds, green algae and communities of polychaete worms are all found in the estuary system; near Calstock is found the shrimp Palaemon longirostris, which has been recorded in only two other estuaries in Britain. The estuary is also one of only two sites in the UK where the fish, allis shad, spawn. Other larger animals found in undisturbed parts of the SSSI include the European otter, the common kingfisher and dormice.

The main advantage is that, even small amounts of shading, debris or snow lines in any one solar cell, or a smaller panel failure, does not disproportionately reduce the output of an entire larger panel.

His origins were in the landed gentry of Shropshire and Staffordshire. A client and son-in-law of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, he became Vice-Admiral under him. He served twice as MP for Shropshire in the English parliament. He was ruined by the burden of debt built up by his father. Family background Richard Leveson's parents were :*Sir Walter Leveson (1551-1602) of Lilleshall, Shropshire, son of Sir Richard Leveson (d.1560) and Mary Fitton (1529–1591). The family name is pronounced , and could be rendered in many ways in the 16th century, including Lewson, Luson and Lucen. In the late Middle Ages, the Levesons were important wool merchants and minor landowners based in the Wolverhampton area. They became major landowners in Shropshire and Staffordshire mainly through the acquisition of former church lands by Walter's grandfather, James Leveson, after the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries. The most important estates were at Lilleshall, where James Leveson had bought first the AbbeyVictoria County History: Shropshire, Volume 2, Chapter 14: The Abbey of Lilleshall. and then the entire manor, and at Trentham, where James bought the lands of the dissolved priory.Victoria County History: Staffordshire, Volume 3, Chapter 16: The Priory of Trentham. Walter was initially an enclosing and improving landlord, raising the family's profile still further, and serving as MP for Shropshire three times.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558-1603 - LEVESON, Walter (1551-1602) - Author: J.J.C. :*Anne Corbet, the daughter of Sir Andrew Corbet of Moreton Corbet, who was vice-president of the powerful Council of Wales and the Marches.

W. Hasler. in concert with the Levesons, they could dictate the representation of Shropshire in the English parliament. The Leveson and Corbet families were the most powerful of the landed gentry families in Shropshire, a county without a resident aristocracy.Coulton, Barbara (2010): Regime and Religion: Shrewsbury 1400-1700, Logaston Press , p.40 Both underwent a crisis in the late Elizabethan and Jacobean periods as a result of overspending and succession problems, coupled with unwise exposure to the vagaries of the State. In Richard Leveson's case, the problems stemmed almost entirely from his father's impulsive and irrational behaviour, stemming apparently from a serious mental illness.

The Ark Royal (1587), by Claes Janszoon Visscher. Inscription on memorial to Richard Leveson, giving career details. Leveson took to the sea in his teenage years and his career was secured by marriage in 1587 to Margaret, the daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, who had been appointed Lord High Admiral in 1585. In 1588 Leveson served as a volunteer on board the Ark Royal against the Spanish Armada, and in 1596 had a command in the expedition against Cadiz, on which occasion he was knighted. In 1597 he is said to have commanded the Hope in 'the Islands' voyage' under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, though other lists describe him as commanding the Nonpareil. It is possible that he moved from one ship to the other during the expedition.Lediard, T. The Naval History of England. Published by John Wilcox and Olive Payne, 1735. Page 354 In 1599 he commanded the Lion in the fleet fitted out, under Lord Thomas Howard, in expectation of a Spanish attempt at invasion. In 1600, with the style of 'admiral of the narrow seas,' he commanded a squadron sent towards the Azores to look out for the Spanish treasure-ships. Great care was taken to keep their destination secret; but the Spaniards, warned by experience, changed the route of their ships, and so escaped. In October 1601 he was appointed captain- general and admiral of certain of her Majesty's ships to serve against the Spaniards lately landed in Ireland. (Cal. State Papers, Ireland), and in the early days of December fought a battle off CastlehavenSilke, John J: Kinsale: the Spanish intervention in Ireland at the end of the Elizabethan war (Four Courts Press Ltd, 2000) and forced his way into the harbour of Kinsale, where, after a severe action, he destroyed the whole of the enemy's shipping under Pedro de Zubiaur.Sir Amyas Preston to the Earl of Nottingham, 9 December 1601 Early in 1602 Leveson was appointed to command a powerful fleet of nine English and twelve Dutch ships, which were to infest the Spanish coast. The Dutch ships were, however, late in joining, and Leveson, leaving his vice- admiral Sir William Monson, to wait for them, put to sea with only five ships on 19 March 1602. Within two or three days the queen sent Monson orders to sail at once to join his admiral, for she had word that 'the silver ships were arrived at Terceira.' They had, in fact, arrived and left again; and before Monson could join him Leveson fell in with them. With his very small force he could do nothing. 'If the Hollanders,' wrote Monson, 'had kept touch, according to promise, and the queen's ships had been fitted out with care, we had made her majesty mistress of more treasure than any of her progenitors ever enjoyed.'The Naval Tracts of Sir William Monson, in Publications of the Navy Records Society, v. 43, 1912 (London, 1913) It was not till the end of May that the two English squadrons met with each other, and on 1 June, being then off Lisbon, they had news of a large carrack and eleven galleys in Cezimbra bay. Some of the English ships had been sent home as not seaworthy; others had separated; there were only five with Leveson when, on the morning of the 3rd, he found the Spanish ships both under the command of Federico Spinola and Álvaro de Bazán strongly posted under the guns of the castle. At ten o'clock he stood into the bay, and after a fight which lasted till five in the evening, two of the galleys were burnt, and the rest, with the carrack, Saõ Valentinho capitulated and were taken to England. The prize money from the carrack worth £3,000 was awarded by Queen Elizabeth. In 1603, during the last sickness and after the death of the queen, Leveson commanded the fleet in the narrow seas, to prevent any attempt to disturb the peace of the country or to influence the succession being made from France or the Netherlands. This was his last service at sea. On 7 April 1604 he was appointed jointly Lieutenant of the Admiralty of England, and Vice-Admiral of England for life (ib. Dom.), and in the following year was marshal of the embassy to Spain for the conclusion of the peace. Shortly after his return he died in London. Member of Parliament =The parliament of 1589= Richard Leveson was elected a member of the English parliament for the first time on 7 November 1588, sitting in the 1589 parliament. He was one of two members for the county of Shropshire, the other being his own father, Walter. In the previous election, in October 1586, Walter had been paired with Richard Corbet, his brother-in- law, and the two families had decisive influence over the choice of MP for several decades. At the time of his election he was only 18 years old, unusual but not unique in this period. The parliament lasted only from 4 February 1589 until 29 March. Leveson was not a prominent and the journals for the 1589 Parliament mention that he asked for leave of absence.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558-1603 - LEVESON, Richard (1570-1605) - Author: J.J.C., accessed 26 September 2013 =The parliament of 1604= Vincent Corbet, Leveson's uncle, who publicly endorsed his election to parliament.

The aftermath of his attainder was one of the issues facing the 1604 parliament that involved Leveson, as a client of the Howards. The summoning of the first parliament of James I found Leveson at the height of his prestige. His capture of the Portuguese carrack was still fresh in the memory. At the funeral of Elizabeth I, he had acted as a knight of the canopy. On his arrival in London in May 1603, James I made Leveson a gentleman of the Privy chamber. Later that year, he was given the task of taking Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton to Winchester for trial as a participant in the Bye Plot. Throughout Elizabeth's reign, Shropshire had been represented by eight families, mainly based in the north of the county, of which the Levesons were one. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris (editors): History of Parliament Online: Constituencies 1604-1629 - Shropshire - Author: Simon Healy, accessed 23 September 2013. Leveson must have seemed an obvious choice at the time and two of the prominent county gentry took the unusual step of countersigning the return to mark their approval: Vincent Corbet, Leveson's uncle, and Francis Newport. Newport's endorsement was significant: a former MP, and three times High Sheriff of Shropshire, he knew Leveson's difficulties well, as the Privy Council had sent him to arrest three of Sir Walter's servants in 1593.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558-1603 - NEWPORT, Francis II (c.1555-1623), of High Ercall, Salop - Author: J.J.C., accessed 26 September 2013 The second member was Robert Needham, a cousin of Leveson and Corbet whose family estates were mainly around Cranage in Cheshire but whose seat was Shavington Hall in Shropshire.

When the parliament assembled on 19 March 1604, Leveson was one of those deputed to administer the Oath of Supremacy to the rest of the House of Commons, He was soon nominated to two committees directly concerned with family affairs of his patron, the Earl of Nottingham. One was the committee to deal with the naturalization of Nottingham's wife. Leveson's mother-in-law had died shortly before the queen. The earl then married a Scottish woman, about fifty years his junior, Margaret Stuart, a daughter of the so-called \\"Bonny Earl\\", James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray. The second committee dealt with provision for Leveson's sister-in-law, Frances Howard, known as Lady Kildare, as she was the widow of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare. Her second husband, Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham had been condemned to death in November 1603 for his part in the Main Plot to install Lady Arbella Stuart on the throne. He was not executed but held in the Tower of London until his health broke down in 1617.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558-1603 - BROOKE, alias COBHAM, Henry II (1564-1619), of Cobham Hall, Kent - Author: P. W. Hasler, accessed 26 September 2013 As proposed by the committee, Parliament granted Cobham's lands to Lady Kildare. Parliament also drew on Leveson's professional expertise. He was named to a committee dealing with the relief of soldiers and sailors who had served in the Irish war and to another on a bill to prohibit the export of iron artillery. The latter was one of a series of measures proposed by the highly experienced MP Robert Wroth, who had sought to set the agenda for the parliament by bringing forward a list of seven \\"grievances\\" or reform proposals around which he hoped to focus debate. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris (editors): History of Parliament Online: Members 1604-1629 - WROTH, Sir Robert I (c.1539-1606) - Author: Andrew Thrush, accessed 24 September 2013. The most important was a proposal to sweep away the abuses of the wardship system, but he also wanted reform of the Exchequer and elements of religious and social reform. Leveson was nominated to a committee to look at the whole programme proposed by Wroth, as well as to some of the committees on specific proposals. However, Wroth was a puritan, the last of the Marian exiles to serve in the House of Commons. His approach was not universally popular and there were powerful interests opposed to him in the Court and in the House of Lords, as well as cracks in his relationship with his patron, Robert Cecil. In the end, none of Wroth's program was carried. Leveson was nominated to a committee to consider Union between the kingdoms of Scotland and England; another proposal that came to nothing at this stage. On 2 May there was a complaint the House's proceedings were not accurately reported to the king by those who had access to him. As a gentleman of the privy chamber, Leveson felt impelled to reply and stood up to do so. However, the puritan Sir Francis Hastings rose at the same time to press home the complaint. The House ruled in favour of Hastings and Leveson was forced to sit down. However, on 5 June he did address the House on a bill for the continuance and repeal of expiring statutes. The Parliament was not dissolved and was to last until 1611. However, Leveson died before the next session was held in 1606. He was replaced as MP after a by-election by the immensely wealthy Shrewsbury lawyer and businessman Sir Roger Owen.

The abbey was less ruinous in Leveson's time and suffered much during the Civil War and later from mining subsidence. Leveson lived occasionally at a hunting lodge next to the abbey. For most of Richard Leveson's life he was heir to great estates, and in his later years he was forced to look on helpless as they were endangered and dissipated. He lived occasionally at Lilleshall, Trentham or Wolverhampton, but was on active service for long periods. Although his personal wealth was largely derived from his maritime activities, including his naval service, privateering and trade, he was appointed to some of the offices appropriate to the Staffordshire and Shropshire landed gentry. By 1594, at latest, he was a justice of the peace in both counties. In 1596 he was made Custos Rotulorum of Shropshire, the senior position in the civil administration of the county, and an important honour. It was his father, Sir Walter Leveson, who placed the Leveson patrimony in great danger, as he was accused of piracy in 1587, and later of sorcery. Initially he took rational measures to increase his income but gradually declined mentally. From 1598 Sir Walter was incarcerated in the Fleet Prison. Although his great estates were still largely intact, they were endangered by the massive debts he incurred as a result of the compensation and fines he was ordered to pay. The debt grew from about £10,500 in 1591 to £12,000 a decade later. By this stage, Richard's mother, Anne Corbet, had died and Walter had married Susan Vernon, a cousin of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Walter wrote to Essex asking that he or one of the Vernons be appointed trustee of the family estates.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 8, 1-15 December 1598. However, Walter was in the grip of a persecutory delusion. He claimed that he was the victim of a plot connected to jealousy of his second marriage. When Richard made suggestions, his father accused him of plotting with a man with the surname Ethell to ruin him.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 10, 1-15 April 1600. Convinced that the death of his daughter-in-law would somehow solve his problems, he grew poisonous plants at Lilleshall and made an attempt on her life. Essex referred the Leveson case to Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, who engineered an agreement in June 1601. Richard Leveson was to take on his father's assets and liabilities in return for an annuity of £580, a generous allowance, as Sir John Leveson later valued the estates at only £600 a year. However, Sir Walter had to guarantee that there were no hidden liabilities. The agreement was never implicated because Richard suspected Sir Walter was plotting to transfer assets to his sister, Mary Curzon - a suspicion confirmed by Susan Vernon. He also foiled an attempt to transfer assets to his illegitimate half-sister, Penelope, by intercepting one of his father's servants. Writing to Robert Cecil in December 1601, Leveson pointed out that :\\"the miserable wrecks of my father’s torn estate are well-known. His want of care, and my want of credit with him to take up loose ends before they ravelled into extremities, are the cause that my lands are now by forfeitures brought into the hands of strangers....What land soever I may discover in the Queen’s service upon a foreign coast, I am never likely to see any profit of my own lands at home\\"Calendar of State Papers Domestic: Elizabeth, 1601-3 Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, was at the centre of a conspiracy to plunder Leveson's estate. Not until 1602 did Leveson inherit the estates on the death of his father, imprisoned to the last in the Fleet. This did not end his problems, but only added to them, as he was now responsible for his father's vast debts. In 1603 he and his step-mother faced legal action from Sir Julius Caesar, who was trying to recover £800. Caesar was a dangerous opponent as he was a powerful and wealthy judge and government minister. The capture of the Portuguese carrack gave considerable relief, but the £3000 Leveson was awarded was far from sufficient to clear his debts. Worse, still it was later to create further financial difficulties. By this time the wreck of Leveson's finances was complete, and he was forced to put the estates into the hands of trustees, headed by his first cousin, Sir John Leveson of Halling, Kent. Sir John Leveson made progress, but little was achieved before the death of Sir Richard Leveson, less than three years later. Rumours then began to circulate that Sir Richard had actually been fabulously wealthy as a result of his seafaring profits. In 1607 Leveson's cabin steward, Walter Grey, claimed that Leveson had concealed and stolen vast quantities of calico and pearls from the carrack - goods which did not form part of his share but rightly belonged to the queen. He alleged that Leveson had a vast cache of pearls in a barn at Sheriffhales, near his Lilleshall estate. Altogether, it was calculated, Leveson had defrauded the queen of goods to the value of £40,000. This was an overwhelming problem for Sir John Leveson,History of Parliament Online: Members 1558-1603 - LEVESON, John (c.1556-1615) - N. M. Fuidge who had no hope of extracting such a vast sum from the estates. He investigated further and was able to undermine trust in Grey's story by bringing witnesses to testify that he had ended on bad terms with Leveson. He then uncovered further evidence that Grey had been given a deed promising £450 out of any fine connected with the carrack affair. The deed had been drawn up by Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, the Lord High Treasurer and a Scottish courtier called Sir James Creighton. Dorset had an interest in exerting leverage on the Leveson estate, as his grandson Edward Sackville was engaged to marry Richard Leveson's cousin, Mary Curzon: the daughter of the Mary Curzon who had earlier conspired with Sir Walter, and heiress of Sir George Curzon of Croxall Hall, Derbyshire. Discovery of the deed meant that Sir John was able to discredit Grey, who had a financial interest in perjuring himself, but doubts lingered and he was up against the most powerful faction in government. He was still faced by a large fine, albeit reduced to £5000. After Sir John's death in 1615, his widow, Christian, took up the challenge of stabilising the Leveson family finances. After numerous further setbacks, she paid off the debts in 1623. This allowed the estates to pass later that year to Sir Richard Leveson's designated heir, the son of Sir John and Christian, and another Sir Richard Leveson. Death and succession Inscription on Leveson's memorial, giving family details, including marriage and succession. Richard Leveson fell ill while staying in the home of a friend, Hugh Bunnell, next to St. Clement’s, Temple Bar, on 22 July 1605. Initially he complained of fever. This was complicated by constant diarrhoea and he died on 2 August 1605. He was buried on 2 September in St Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton. Leveson had made his will on 17 March 1605. In it he chose to characterise life in terms of the travails of landholding: :\\"calling to mind the uncertainty of all earthly things, and that we hold and enjoy ourselves together with all our temporal blessings but as tenants at will to our good God that gave them.\\" Always alive to the possibility of death on active service, on 23 March he had also drawn up a deed conveying all his property to a group of trustees headed by his friend and distant relative, Sir Robert Harley, who were responsible for raising £10,000 to settle his debts. A second deed on the same date named his heirs. As he had no male issue, he left the bulk of his property to his godson and third cousin, Richard Leveson (1598–1661), son of Sir John Leveson (d.1615), who had once shared in his privateering activities. However, also named as heir was Leveson's illegitimate daughter, Anne Fitton, who he hoped would marry the young Richard Leveson. Richard Leveson went on to become a Member of Parliament and a prominent royalist soldier in the English Civil War. However, he married Katherine Dudley, leaving his benefactor's plan in tatters. Leveson's will also awarded £1000 to Penelope, his illegitimate half-sister, whom he had previously managed to exclude from inheriting from his father's property. Marriage and family At the age of 17, Leveson married by licence, dated 13 December 1587, Margaret, daughter of the Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and Catherine Carey. The couple had one child, who died while young. Margaret later suffered increasingly from a mental disorder, allegedly because of the loss of her child, although she also suffered at least one attempt on her life by father-in-law. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris (editors): History of Parliament Online: Members 1604-1629 - LEVESON, Sir Richard (1570-1605), of Lilleshall Lodge, Salop; Trentham and Parton, Staffs. and Bethnal Green, Mdx. - Author: Andrew Thrush, accessed 23 September 2013. As Richard Leveson lay dying, her father wrote to Robert Cecil asking for her wardship. :\\"I am very sorry to have such a subject to write of, which is that my son Lewson is most dangerously sick and to be much doubted of his recovery. For he is the weakest man that ever I saw and is still in the extremity of the burning fever and now in a very great looseness. There is little hope of him. And as you know my poor daughter, his wife, in what case of weakness she is; and I know how ready men are to seek after such things at his Majesty's hands, and because I know it chiefly concerns your offer, although I know her state is not so weak as by law she can be found so imperfect, yet I would be loth it should come in question being my daughter. Therefore in your love to me prevent it and let me have the custody of my own daughter, that her imperfection which it has pleased God to lay on her may not be so known to my great grief in the end of my years. It is well known what she was till God called her only child away, which her nature and weak spirit could not resist; and with all that, which you know of, her bad father-in-law's dealing with her, whom God forgive for it. If God call him, the King shall lose a worthy servant and myself one that I accounted rather my natural son than a son-in- law. Good my lord, you are a father and therefore you best know my case in this.—Chelse, 2 August.\\" The wardship was instead granted to her brother, William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Effingham. Margaret's wardship finally passed to her father after Effingham's death in 1615. In the final years of his life, Leveson set up home at Perton, near Wolverhampton, with the noted courtesan Mary Fitton, the daughter of Sir Edward Fitton of Gawsworth, Cheshire (1548-1606) and Alice Holcroft (d.1627).Kathy Lynn Emerson (2008-13): A Who’s Who of Tudor Women: F They were second cousins: Leveson's paternal grandmother was also called Mary Fitton. They had a daughter, Anne, for whom Leveson sought to provide in his will. Mary Fitton continued to reside at Perton after Leveson's death, marrying another naval officer, Captain William Polewhele. The affair with Mary Fitton appears to have had no effect on Leveson's personal or political relations with Lord Howard, who continued to write of him as a son. In January 1605 Leveson talked to one of the royal physicians, and had courtiers praise Mary Fitton's sister Anne Newdigate to the pregnant Anne of Denmark in an unsuccessful attempt to get her made nurse to Princess Mary.Anne Newdigate-Newdigate, Gossip from a Muniment Room: Being passages in the lives of Anne and Mary Fitton (London, 1897), pp. 68-72. Portraiture Statue of Vice Admiral Sir Richard Leveson (1570-1605) by Hubert Le Sueur in the Lady Chapel of St Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton, where Leveson was buried. Self-portrait of Isaac Oliver, who produced at least three versions of a portrait miniature of Sir Richard Leveson. There are three examples of a portrait miniature of Leveson by the Huguenot artist Isaac Oliver, apparently all painted personally by Oliver towards 1600,Wallace Collection Online - Sir Richard Leveson one of which is held by the Wallace Collection. They are regarded as typical of the style of Oliver, who studied under Nicholas Hilliard, the leading English miniaturist of the period. Oliver went on to become the official miniaturist to Anne of Denmark. St Peter's Collegiate Church has a striking statue and monument to Leveson. The bronze statue is by Hubert Le Sueur, another Huguenot artist who made a career in England. It originally formed part of a family group in the chancel. After damage during the English Civil War, it was detached and reassembled in the lady chapel. A bronze plaque now recites Leveson's main naval achievements, while another gives details of his family connections. Le Sueur went on to work for Charles I, producing a well-known equestrian statue of him now at Charing Cross. A portrait of Sir Richard Leveson, said to be by Anthony van Dyck, belongs to the Duke of Sutherland,Royal naval exhibition, 1891: the illustrated handbook and souvenir the head of the Leveson-Gower family. Probably this painting was of the Royalist Member of Parliament, Sir Richard Leveson. This later Sir Richard was the uncle of Lady Christian (Leveson) Temple who had married the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos's ancestor, Sir Peter Temple. This portrait was purchased for £65 02s 00p from the sale of the possessions of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos held at Stowe House, Buckinghamshire in 1848. It was described in the sale catalogue as by Van Dyck (whereas other paintings are described as 'after Van Dyck' or a 'copy of Van Dyck'). The catalogue records that Sir Richard is shown ‘in a black dress, with a frill’and that the painting was ‘bought ‘after a very active competition.’Henry Rumsey Forster, The Stowe Catalogue Priced and Annotated 1848, London, David Bogue, Fleet Street, p.178, Item 318 References *  External links  * http://www.nearestplacetoheaven.co.uk/Ownership.html Category:1570s births Category:1605 deaths Richard Leveson (1570-1605), Vice-Admiral, MP Category:16th-century Royal Navy personnel Category:17th-century Royal Navy personnel Category:English MPs 1589 Category:English MPs 1604–1611 Category:English admirals Category:English people of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) ","title":"Richard Leveson (admiral)"},{"id":"33692484","text":"Laurence Oxburgh (1611–1678) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1659.

When that moisture laden air reaches a layer inside the interstitial structure that is at dew point temperature, it condenses into liquid water on that surface. The moisture laden air can penetrate into hidden interstitial wall cavity through the exterior in a warm/humid outdoor period, and from inside the building during warm/humid indoor periods. Groundwater soaking the basement foundation walls from wet soil is common. This can result from a high water table or from improperly drained rainwater runoff soaking into the ground next to the basement walls. Moisture saturated basement walls will add moisture directly into basement interstitial spaces leading to interstitial condensation with cool basement temperatures. All interstitial condensation can cause uncontrolled mold and bacteria growth, rotting of wood components, corrosion of metal components and/or a reduction in the thermal insulation's effectiveness.\\"Interstitial condensation and fabric degradation\\" - BRE - The Construction Information Service. Products.ihs.com. accessed 2012-05-16 The resulting structural damage, along with mold and bacteria growth, may occur without any visible surface indications until significant damage or extensive mold and bacteria growth has occurred. HVAC ducts within interstitial spaces (chases) can leak out cold air through unsealed joints/connections which produces dew point surfaces. Unsealed duct joints/connections can also create suction that pulls humid air into interstitial spaces and chases. This can promote more mold and bacteria growth on the condensed cool surfaces of the interstitial spaces. In addition, the cool ducts themselves can condense humid air and “sweat” even more liquid water into the interstitial spaces thereby exacerbating mold and bacteria growth. Since most building materials are permeable and many joints are not completely sealed, it's critical in controlling interstitial condensation to control indoor moisture at its sources (venting out shower vapor), through HVAC dehumidification, ventilation and by adding an impermeable vapor barrier in the interstitial cavity. In addition, since the air in interstitial cavities can communicate with interior spaces through tiny cracks and unsealed joints, any airborne mold, aerosolized fungal fragments and bacteria growth in the interstitial cavity can travel into the building's air to then be breathed in by building occupants. Interstitial condensation is differentiated from surface condensation in buildings which is known as \\"cold-bridge condensation\\" or \\"warm front condensation\\"Tim Hutton. \\"Condensation\\". The Building Conservation Directory, 2004 accessed 2012-05-16 where the condensation forms on the interior or exterior surfaces of a building rather than inside wall, floor or roof cavities. Moisture sources It is physically impossible to build envelope assemblies so that they completely prevent air infiltration, exfiltration of water vapor diffusion. Moist air can infiltrate envelope assemblies driven by the pressure differential created by wind and stack effect. Since all buildings contain various levels of moist air, cognizant authorities have recommended maintaining an indoor relative humidity of air between 40% to 60%. The sources of interior moisture are people, appliances such as dishwashers, cooking, showers, wet basements, leaking pipes and roof/wall rainwater leaks. Leaks of liquid water into the building envelope are a different problem than interstitial moisture condensation, but this additional water can exacerbate interstitial wetting which can increase mold and bacteria growth. Discovering wet interstitial spaces Building professionals have moisture sensing instruments to discover areas of interstitial condensation which may contain possible mold & bacteria growth. There are three primary methods to test for interstitial moisture-surface testing and cavity testing: # Surface testing with pin-type moisture meters. This meter works on a resistance principle that measures the flow of electricity between two pin tips and measures the moisture of that very tiny path. Pin meters only measure the moisture at the point in the material (drywall or wood) between the two pins. # Behind wall testing with electromagnetic moisture meters. This meter detects and evaluates moisture conditions within various building materials by non-destructively measuring the electrical impedance. A low frequency electronic signal is transmitted into the material via the electrodes in the base of the instrument. The strength of this signal varies in proportion to the amount of moisture in the material under test. The moisture meter determines the strength of the current and converts this to a moisture content value, displaying it on a analog dial or digital screen. # Infrared cameras to detect surface temperatures (wet walls are cooler). Infrared cameras are good tools for quickly finding surface moisture, but depend on sufficiently wetted surfaces which show up as a cooler temperature. Depending on the instrument's quality and sensitivity, the instrument may or may not find surface moisture area, and should always be used in conjunction with surface or behind wall meters.. Prevention Preventing interstitial condensation by keeping these hidden spaces dry, is critical in all buildings. This is done by: # maintaining a slightly positive indoor pressure in warm months and a neutral pressurization in cold months; # preventing infiltration (exterior air leakage into the building); # preventing exfiltration (interior air leakage into the assemblies);Straube, John. \\"BSD-163: Controlling Cold-Weather Condensation Using Insulation\\". Building Science Digests. Building Science Corporation. March 10, 2011 # controlling indoor moisture at its sources through exhaust ventilation, # having correct HVAC design for efficient air dehumidification; # effective vapor barrier wall sealing; # proper insulation; # using an impervious vapor barrier (vapor check) on the warm side of the insulation, i.e., inside the assembly on a heated building and outside on a cooled building.McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. Engineering Materials Science: Properties, Uses, Degradation and Remediation. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 166. Print. Vapor barriers can be problematic because they difficult to install perfectly and also reduce the ability of a cavity to dry out when it does get wet. Vapor barriers are used in conjunction with a housewrap which are vapor permeable but a water resistant membrane, so that one side of the cavity is permeable to allow drying.McMullan, Randall. Environmental Science in Building. 4th ed. Basingstoke, England: Macmillan, 1998. 98. Print. Spray foam insulation can an effective vapor barrier if applied correctly. Historically, most buildings built before the twentieth century were not designed to maintain 70F/21C, were both naturally well ventilated and built with very permeable materials. The increase in interstitial condensation problems are due to: # the modern prevalence of central heating and air conditioning; # the construction of air- tighter enclosures causing buildings to be negatively pressurized; # more heavily insulated buildings; # more indoor plumbing sweating and leaking. Other construction Interstitial condensation problems may also occur in other structures with enclosed air spaces along with the presence of high humidity and a large temperature difference between exterior and interior, including refrigerated vehicles. Freezing The process may cause further problems if freezing is involved. Condensed water expands when frozen, possibly causing further structural damage.

Euphrasius’ diocese was traditionally associated with Illiturgis (Iliturgi), located between Bailén and Andújar.Alfonso Lowe, Hugh Seymour-Davies, The companion guide to the south of Spain (Companion Guides, 2000), 369. He is said to have been martyred at Illiturgis. According to tradition, he is one of the group of Seven Apostolic Men (siete varones apostólicos), seven Christian clerics ordained in Rome by Saints Peter and Paul and sent to evangelize Spain. Besides Euphrasius, this group includes Sts. Hesychius, Ctesiphon, Torquatus, Indaletius, and Secundius (Isicio, Cecilio, Tesifonte, Eufrasio, Hesiquio y Segundo).Monks of Ramsgate. \\"Torquatus, Ctesiphon, Secundus, Indaletius, Hesychius and Euphrasius\\".

CatholicSaints.Info. 8 May 2017 Veneration The communal feast of the Seven Apostolic Men was celebrated in the Mozarabic Liturgy.David Hugh Farmer, The Oxford dictionary of saints (Oxford University Press, 2004). In the 7th century, Sisebut built a church over the saint's sepulcher at Illiturgis, but during the invasion of Spain by the Moors in the 8th century, his relics were translated to the Valley of the Mao River in Galicia, in Lugo Province. He is buried in the church of Santa María do Mao, in the municipality of O Incio, near the monastery of San Xulián de Samos in Samos. Euphrasius is also patron of Corsica and of Ajaccio; “this seems to have been due to a secondary translation of his relics.” A relic of a kerchief found in a chapel behind the high altar of Jaén Cathedral is associated with a legend of St. Euphrasius. When Euphrasius was sent to Rome to free the Pope from Satan's temptations, it is said that he traveled to Rome in only half an hour due to the assistance of a captive goblin who helped the saint in return for some leftovers from the saint's supper. Euphrasius vanquished Satan, and was awarded with a kerchief. Euphrasius is also associated with the cult of Our Lady of Cabeza (la Virgen de la Cabeza). According to one legend, when Saint Euphrasius came to Spain, he brought with him an image of the Virgin Mary to which he showed devotion. According to the legend, this image was given to Euphrasius by Saint Peter, and is said to have been the portrait that Saint Luke painted of the Virgin Mary.

His early academic positions included being an assistant professor in pharmacology and later the first Hartzell Professor of Research Therapeutics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania as well as dean of the school from 1945 to 1948. Education Starr attended primary and secondary school in Philadelphia, graduating from the Chestnut Hill Academy in 1912. From there he went to Princeton University where he received his Bachelor of Science degree, graduating magna cum laude in 1916. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1920. After receiving his M.D., Starr went to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he completed his internship before returning to Penn, where he later became a heart disease specialist, motivated by the heart disease-related death of his mother. Career After returning to Penn, Starr joined Alfred Newton Richards’ group investigating mechanisms by which the kidney created urine. At the request of Richards, Starr became one of the first assistant professors at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1928, doing research which used physics and mathematics in the study of the heart, and leading a course in clinical pharmacology for the medical students. In 1933, he became the first Hartzell Professor of Research Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and held the position until 1961. The endowed chair funded everything except for salaries for his research assistants. Starr had known that heart disease could precede congestive heart failure by several years, but at the time heart disease was typically diagnosed at autopsy by a pathologist. This led him, shortly after joining Penn, to participate in a cardiac output methods program by the American Physiological Society. At this program, his colleague, Yandell Henderson, demonstrated an apparatus for measuring cardiac output, a ballistocardiograph. This project, a suspended bed rigged with springs to pick up resonance frequencies and amplify them, inspired Starr to develop a practical version for use in his own research, with the help of the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics. This new device used an optical recording system for more accurate readings, however, due to the low natural frequency of heartbeats, patients had to hold their breath while using it. The issue with led him to modify the design of the bed to counteract the minute movements using springs, thereby fixing this flaw and allowing the patients to breathe. The final device, introduced in November 1939 by Starr and Dr. Henry A. Schroeder, was used to measure cardiac output and led to the first accurate physical measurements and to detection of when the heart chambers do not contract simultaneously. The most notable use, however, was that of detecting heart abnormalities much earlier and more accurately in patients, leading to further development and extensive contributions to the field from 1930 to 1960. Before the redesign, however, in 1936, Starr had secured records on multiple healthy people, namely medical students, faculty, friends, and family members. Over the next 40 years, he would study his subjects and eventually report a clinical series on them, detailing such observations as, \\"Patients with clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease who also had abnormal BCGs developed twice as many recurrences as did those having ischemic heart disease and normal records.\\" During World War II, Isaac Starr and Dr. Eugene A. Stead were members of a committee of the National Research Council that was tasked with deciding which chemicals and medications were considered important to medicine. Stead noted in a memoir he felt indebted to Starr for taking him to the National Gallery of Art during some free hours after a day of work which lead to his appreciation of art. Starr was one of the first people to suggest that venous congestion was related to the volume of blood and the muscle tone of the vessels, while a weakened heart's contributions were less important than previously thought. He also questioned whether the kidney and its endocrine function were involved in the disease's pathogenesis. The University of Pennsylvania held a symposium in honor of Isaac Starr in 1978, and then awarded Starr with an honorary Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) degree in 1983 for his contributions to medicine.

The plastic case is translucent, revealing the motor and electronics. On top a cross-shaped bellcrank lever provides the mechanical output Servos (also RC servos) are small, cheap, mass-produced servomotors or other actuators used for radio control and small-scale robotics. Most servos are rotary actuators although other types are available. Linear actuators are sometimes used, although it is more common to use a rotary actuator with a bellcrank and pushrod. Some types, originally used as sail winches for model yachting, can rotate continuously.  Construction  alt=A small radio control servo, dismantled to show the component parts. A typical servo consists of a small electric motor driving a train of reduction gears. A potentiometer is connected to the output shaft. Some simple electronics provide a closed-loop servomechanism.  Operation  The position of the output, measured by the potentiometer, is continually compared to the commanded position from the control (i.e., the radio control). Any difference gives rise to an error signal in the appropriate direction, which drives the electric motor either forwards or backwards, and moving the output shaft to the commanded position. When the servo reaches this position, the error signal reduces and then becomes zero, at which point the servo stops moving. If the servo position changes from that commanded, whether this is because the command changes, or because the servo is mechanically pushed from its set position, the error signal will re-appear and cause the motor to restore the servo output shaft to the position needed. Almost all modern servos are proportional servos, where this commanded position can be anywhere within the range of movement. Early servos, and a precursor device called an escapement, could only move to a limited number of set positions.  Connection  Radio control servos are connected through a standard three-wire connection: two wires for a DC power supply and one for control, carrying a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. Each servo has a separate connection and PWM signal from the radio control receiver. This signal is easily generated by simple electronics, or by microcontrollers such as the Arduino. This, together with their low-cost, has led to their wide adoption for robotics and physical computing. RC servos use a three-pin 0.1\\" spacing jack (female) which mates to standard 0.025\\" square pins. The most common order is signal, +voltage, ground. The standard voltage is 4.8 V DC, however 6 V and 12 V is also used on a few servos. The control signal is a digital PWM signal with a 50 Hz frame rate. Within each 20 ms timeframe, an active-high digital pulse controls the position. The pulse nominally ranges from 1.0 ms to 2.0 ms with 1.5 ms always being center of range. Pulse widths outside this range can be used for \\"overtravel\\" - moving the servo beyond its normal range. There are two general types of PWM. Each PWM defines a value that is used by the servo to determine its expected position. The first type is \\"absolute\\" and defines the value by the width of the active-high time pulse with an arbitrarily long period of low time. The second type is \\"relative\\" and defines the value by the percentage of time the control is active-high versus low-time. The \\"absolute\\" type allows up to eight servos to share one communication channel by multiplexing control signals using relatively simple electronics and is the basis of modern RC servos. The \\"relative\\" type is the more traditional usage of PWM whereby a simple low-pass filter converts a \\"relative\\" PWM signal into an analog voltage. The two types are both PWM because the servo responds to the width of the pulse. However, in the first case a servo may also be sensitive to pulse order. The servo is controlled by three wires: ground, power, and control. The servo will move based on the pulses sent over the control wire, which set the angle of the actuator arm. The servo expects a pulse every 20 ms in order to gain correct information about the angle. The width of the servo pulse dictates the range of the servo's angular motion. A servo pulse of 1.5 ms width will typically set the servo to its \\"neutral\\" position (typically half of the specified full range), a pulse of 1.0 ms will set it to 0°, and a pulse of 2.0 ms to 90° (for a 90° servo). The physical limits and timings of the servo hardware varies between brands and models, but a general servo's full angular motion will travel somewhere in the range of 90° – 180° and the neutral position (45° or 90°) is almost always at 1.5 ms. This is the \\"standard pulse servo mode\\" used by all hobby analog servos. A hobby digital servo is controlled by the same \\"standard pulse servo mode\\" pulses as an analog servo.Society of Robots, \\"What is the difference between an analog and digital servo?\\" Some hobby digital servos can be set to another mode that allows a robot controller to read back the actual position of the servo shaft. Some hobby digital servos can optionally be set to another mode and \\"programmed\\", so it has the desired PID controller characteristics when it is later driven by a standard RC receiver.\\"Digital Servo Operation and Interface\\", robosavvy.com basicmicro.com RC servos are usually powered by the receiver, which in turn is powered by battery packs or an electronic speed controller (ESC) with an integrated or a separate battery eliminator circuit (BEC). Common battery packs are either NiCd, NiMH or lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPo) type. Voltage ratings vary, but most receivers are operated at 5 V or 6 V.  Mechanical specification  Manufacturers and distributors of hobby RC servos often use a specific shorthand notation of mechanical properties of the servos. Two figures are typically stated: angular speed of servo shaft rotation and mechanical torque produced on the shaft. Speed is expressed as a time interval that a servo requires in order to rotate the shaft for 60° angle. Torque is expressed as weight that can be pulled up by the servo if it hangs from a pulley with a certain radius mounted on the shaft. For example, if a servo model is described as \\"0.2 s / 2 kg\\", that should be interpreted as \\"This servo rotates the shaft for 60° in 0.2 seconds, and it is able to pull up 2 kg weight using a 1 cm radius pulley\\". That is, that particular servo model rotates the shaft with the angular speed of (2π / 6) / 0.2 s = 5.2 rad/s while producing 2 kg × 9.81 m/s2 = 19.6 N force at 1 cm distance, i.e. it produces 19.6 N × 0.01 m = 0.196 N m torque. Although not in accordance with either the SI or Imperial unit system, the shorthand notation is in fact quite useful, as 60° shaft rotation commands, 1 cm long shaft cranks, as well as control rod \\"forces\\" in kilogram-force range are typical in hobby RC world.  Continuous-rotation servos  Continuous-rotation servos are servos that do not have a limited travel angle, instead they can rotate continuously. They can be thought of as a motor and gearbox with servo input controls. In such servos the input pulse results in a rotational speed, and the typical 1.5 ms center value is the stop position. A smaller value should turn the servo clockwise and a higher one counterclockwise.  Escapements  thumbuprightEscapement operating sequence alt=Diagrams of the four steps for an escapement to move through The earliest form of sequential (although not proportional) actuator for radio control was the escapement. Like the device used in clocks, this escapement controls the release of stored energy from a spring or rubber band. Each signal from the transmitter operates a small solenoid that then allows a two- or four-lobed pawl to rotate. The pawl, like a clock, has two pallets so that the pawl can only rotate by one lobe's position, per signal pulse. This mechanism allows a simple keyed transmitter to give sequential control, i.e. selection between a number of defined positions at the model. A typical four- lobe escapement used for rudder control is arranged so that the first and third positions are \\"straight ahead\\", with positions two and four as \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" rudder. A single pulse from the first straight-ahead position allows it to move to left, or three pulses would select right. A further single pulse returns to straight-ahead. Such a system is difficult to use, as it requires the operator to remember which position the escapement is in, and so whether the next turn requires one or three pulses from the current position. A development of this was the two-lobe pawl, where keying the transmitter continuously (and thus holding the solenoid pallet in place) could be used to select the turn positions with the same keying sequence, no matter what the previous position. Escapements were low-powered, but light-weight. They were thus more popular for model aircraft than model boats. Where a transmitter and receiver had multiple control channels (e.g., a frequency- keyed reed receiver), then multiple escapements could be used together, one for each channel. Even with single channel radios, a sequence of escapements could sometimes be cascaded. Moving one escapement gave pulses that in turn drove a second, slower speed, escapement. Escapements were disappearing from radio control, in favour of servos, by the early 1970s.

Used with a keyed radio system, this allowed some control over the rudder position by varying the key push timing. The rudder would be pulled back by a spring when the motor speed decreased.

Baseball career Born in North Henderson, Illinois in 1900, Swanson's first pro team was the 1923 Cedar Rapids Bunnies of the Mississippi Valley League, a Class D circuit where he played for the first six seasons of his career. Swanson's breakout year was 1928, when he batted .384 (third-highest in the league); in August, he was signed by the White Sox and installed as the club's second baseman. Although solid defensively, Swanson was baffled by big-league pitching and could only manage nine hits (eight singles and a double) in 65 at-bats, for a .138 average. (Swanson was also married that year, on June 16, to Lucille.) After a strong spring training in 1929, however, Swanson came north with the Sox but was used only sparingly, pinch hitting in two games before being returned to the minors in early May. Swanson knocked around the minors for several more years before ending up in the same place he began: with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Western League, in 1935. Swanson was the only major league player to live through the entire 20th century, being born in the 19th century and dying in the 21st – Negro League pitcher Silas Simmons is the only other professional athlete with this distinction, dying at the age of 111 in 2006. At the time of his death, Swanson was the oldest living former major league player.
