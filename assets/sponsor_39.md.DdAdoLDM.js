It was established on 1 July 1843 through the amalgamation of a number of existing regional banks and headquartered in Madras (now Chennai). It was merged with the other Presidency banks in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which later became the State Bank of India. Origin In 1683, Governor William Gyfford (1681‚Äì1687) and his Council in Madras established a bank. In 1805, Governor Sir William Bentinck convened a Finance Committee that recommended the formation of a First government bank in India; the Madras Bank, which was sometimes called the Government Bank amalgamated Lord Krishna Bank, began functioning from 1 February 1806. It initially functioned from the Exchange Building‚Äîthe building housing the present Fort Museum‚Äîwithin Fort St. George. The Bank of Madras was formed in 1843 as a joint stock company with a capital of Rupees 3 million by the amalgamation of Madras Bank, Carnatic Bank (1788), the British Bank of Madras (1795), and the Asiatic Bank (1804). Bank of Madras had a branch network spread into all the major cities and trade centers of South India, including Bangalore, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mangalore, Calicut, Tellicherry, Cochin, Alleppy, Cocanada, Guntur, Masulipatnam, Ootacamund, Nagapatnam, and Tuticorin. It also had a branch in Colombo, British Ceylon, now called Sri Lanka. Activities The Bank of Madras undertook all the normal activities that are common to a commercial bank. The Bank of Madras, in the absence of any central banking authority during that time, also conducted certain functions that are ordinarily a preserve of a central bank. It also issued banknotes in the Madras Presidency. These included managing the banking business of the Presidency of Madras and offices of the colonial government of India located in South India, and managing the Public Debt Office of the Government of Madras. Milestone The head office of the Bank of Madras was shifted to a new building, on South Beach Road, Madras, in 1897. The site was acquired for 100,000 in 1895, building was designed by Col. Samuel Jacob, and suitably modified and adapted by Henry Irwin (1841‚Äì1922), and constructed by Namperumal Chetty, a reputed builder, for 300,000. The building is an exquisite example of Victorian architecture. Currently, the building houses several offices of State Bank of India, including its main city office. Epilogue The Bank of Madras merged with the two other Presidency banks‚Äîthe Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay‚Äîon 27 January 1921 and the reorganized banking entity took on the name Imperial Bank of India. In 1955, the Reserve Bank of India, which is the central banking organization of India, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India. On 30 April 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the State Bank of India.

His term as governor was marked by the start of the Great Depression. Early life=Family and education= Harry G. Leslie was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, on April 6, 1878 to Daniel and Mary Burkhart Leslie. His father was a local politician and served a chief of police for the town. While still a boy, his family moved into the country outside of the town. He attended public schools and worked delivering groceries as a teenager. In 1898 he was elected town clerk, a year after he graduated.Gugin, p.80 He soon enrolled in the recently constructed Purdue University where he was a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity and Acacia fraternity. While at Purdue, Leslie was captain of both the school's football and baseball teams and became one of the school's \\"immortal\\" players. As one of the school's star players, his team was on course to win the state championship in 1903. On October 31 he and his teammates took a train from Lafayette to Indianapolis to a match against Indiana University. As the train neared the 18th Street crossing in Indianapolis, it collided with another train, and Leslie's coach was shattered. One member of the team miraculously landed on his feet and was unharmed after being thrown out a window. The other eighteen boys, including Leslie, were pronounced dead at the scene and taken to the morgue.Gugin, p. 281 A few hours later at the morgue, as the morticians prepared to embalm his body, they discovered he still had a pulse and immediately rushed him to the hospital. Barely alive, he needed several operations and edged on death for several weeks. His recovery was slow, but he eventually regained his health, although he walked with the aid of a cane for the remainder of his life. He returned to school at the end of 1904 and after another year he graduated. His survival of the \\"Purdue Wreck\\" received significant attention across the state and he became a famous folk hero.Gugin, p. 282 In 1904, Leslie founded the Purdue College Republicans. For a number of years in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Purdue chapter held a \\"Leslie Day\\" celebration and fundraiser in his honor.https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_faee4548-bf46-5008-b0c9-307d4731871c.html Leslie graduated from the Indiana Law School in 1907. He opened a law office in Lafayette the year he graduated and took a position at a local high school coaching football. There he met Martha Morgan, whom he married on August 16, 1910, and by whom he had three sons, Jack, Richard, and Robert. Leslie became involved in local politics and was elected as a Republican Tippecanoe County treasurer in 1912. He purchased a farm in 1914, but disliking the labor, he sold the farm and bought stock in a local bank at which he served as president until 1924. Political career=Speaker of the House= In 1923 Leslie, aided by his popularity, was elected to represent Tippecanoe and Warren County in the Indiana House of Representatives. He became known for his down-to-earth style of speaking, and quickly made many allies in the body. He was reelected twice, and served through 1929. In 1925 he was elected Speaker of the House, and remained in that position until he left the body. His term as Speaker was dominated by the Indiana Ku Klux Klan. Their leader was arrested and convicted of rape and murder in 1925, and over the next two years many other Klansman were exposed and forced out of office on a host of charges‚Äîincluding nearly half the members of the General Assembly. The Klan had supported him in his bid for the speakership primarily because they opposed his rival candidate. Leslie fought the Klan block on several issues, including committee assignments, legislation aimed at eliminating Catholic schools, and other issues.Gugin, p. 286 Leslie was pleased with the Grand Dragon's conviction and the collapse in Klan power. He personally believed he was innocent of the charges but thought he deserved prison because of his many unknown crimes. Among the causes Leslie championed was the creation of the Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis.Gugin. p. 284 =Governor= Leslie ran for the governor's nomination in the 1928 Republican primary. Among the five candidates, no one took a majority and the nomination went to the state convention. Leslie won on the fifth ballot and defeated the Democratic major of Indianapolis, Frank Daily, and was elected with 51.3% if the vote. He was the state's fifth consecutive Republican governor. One of his first acts as governor was to support legislation to repeal the state's 1915 primary election laws, and return candidate selections to state conventions. The measure was approved in 1929, and much to the disappointment of the Klan. The first part of Leslie's term was a period of economic growth and he hosted several high-profile events, including the National Governors Association, a visit by President Herbert Hoover, Charles Lindbergh, and other famous guests. The Great Depression began in 1929, and was complicated by a drought in the state. He instituted some relief measures, but largely did nothing significant believing that the Depression would soon end. In 1932 he called a special session of the General Assembly to lower taxes. Among the relief legislation passed by the General Assembly was Indiana's first old-age pension act, but Leslie vetoed it. As the Depression continued, Leslie decided more needed to be done. He began hiring unemployed workers to work on state road projects. He also advocated that his program be duplicated by the federal government, and his plan was soon implemented as the WPA. Among Leslie's other projects was continuing to grow the state park system.Gugin, p. 285 Later years Following his governorship Leslie became a founder, and eventually the president, of Standard Life Insurance Company in Indianapolis. Leslie enjoyed humor and among his close friends were George Ade and Will Rogers. While visiting Ade in Miami, Leslie died unexpectedly from heart disease on December 10, 1937. His remains were returned to Indianapolis where he lay in state before being moved to Lafayette for a funeral and burial.Gugin, p. 287 See also *List of Governors of Indiana References Notes Bibliography * External links *Indiana Historical Bureau: Biography and portrait *Indiana County History - Leslie Biography *National Governors Association *\\"The 'Immortal' Boilermaker: Exploring the Forgotten History of Harry Guyer Leslie\\" *Harry Leslie at FindaGrave Category:1878 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Governors of Indiana Category:People from West Lafayette, Indiana Category:Purdue University alumni Category:Indiana University Robert H.

Jin Hi Kim (born February 6, 1957 in Incheon, South Korea) is a composer and performer of komungo and electric komungo, and a Korean music specialist. Kim is known as a pioneer for introducing geomungo (Í±∞Î¨∏Í≥†, a Korean fretted board zither, also spelled komungo) to American contemporary classical music scene through her own cross- cultural chamber and orchestral compositions and her extensive solo work in avant-garde, as well as cross-cultural free improvisation. She is a Guggenheim fellow in composition and her recent works include the development of komungobot (algorithmic robotic instrument) and solo performances of the world's only electric komungo with live interactive MIDI computer system in her large-scale multimedia performance pieces. Kim has received commissions from the American Composers Orchestra, Kronos Quartet, and Tan Dun's New Generation of East for Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, among others. During the last three decades Kim has performed as a komungo soloist in her own compositions at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center (Washington, D.C.), Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Asia Society (NYC), Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin), and for collaborative improvisations at Royal Festival Hall (London), Venice Biennale, Moers Festival (Germany) and many significant international festivals throughout the USA, Europe, Canada, Latin America, South America, Russia, Asia, New Zealand, and Australia. Biography= Early life = She began studies of traditional Korean music in South Korea in 1973, at her father's recommendation. She received a full scholarship to study at South Korea's first National High School for Korean Traditional Music (Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍµ≠ÏïÖÍ≥†Îì±ÌïôÍµê), one of 60 students accepted in the first year. The school was established under Ministry of Culture in association with the prestigious National Gugak Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts (Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍµ≠ÏïÖÏõê). There, she practiced court orchestra music, learned both court and folk styles of singing (Í∞ÄÍ≥° kagok, ÌåêÏÜåÎ¶¨ pansori, ÎØºÏöî folk song), drumming (Ïû•Í≥† janggo) and bamboo flutes (Îã®ÏÜå danso, ÏÜåÍ∏à sogeum), and selected the geomungo (Í±∞Î¨∏Í≥†, a six feet long board zither with sixteen frets and six silk strings that are plucked with a thin bamboo stick) as her major instrument. Her selection of the instrument was audacious; dating to the fourth century, the geomungo had been favored particularly by male Confucian scholars, and was generally not played by women. Upon graduation she received Ministry of Culture's Outstanding Student Award (Î¨∏ÌôîÍ≥µÎ≥¥Î∂ÄÏû•Í¥ÄÏÉÅ). She continued her studies with Korea's leading ethnomusicologists earning a B.A. degree in Korean traditional music theory and composition from Seoul National University in 1980. Upon graduation she received an award for rising new musicians and her composition was premiered for KBS-TV national broadcasting. = Move to the United States = Interested in learning more about the musics of other cultures but aware that this would not be possible in Korea, Kim emigrated in August 1980 to the United States, where she immersed herself in world music. She first attended the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and studied composition with John Adams for one year then transferred to Mills College in Oakland, California, where she studied with Lou Harrison, Terry Riley, David Rosenboom, and Larry Polansky and received an MFA in electronic music and recording media in 1985. She was awarded Paul Merrit Henry Prize upon graduation. While in California, she also studied the Chinese guqin (an ancient 7-stringed zither) and Indian bansuri (bamboo flute) from G. S. Sachdev, and began to investigate the possibility of cross-cultural creative music. During the 1980s, she regularly attended the New Music America festival, where she met many noted contemporary composers including John Cage, La Monte Young, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, Lou Harrison, Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Joan La Barbara, Morton Subotnick, Meredith Monk, Joseph Celli, Malcolm Goldstein, David Moss, Elliott Sharp, John Zorn and many others. From 1982 to 1988, she worked as a correspondent, interviewing and writing over 30 articles about those contemporary American composers for Eumak Dong-A, a Korean monthly music magazine published by the Dong-A Daily News. Plunged into the American avant-garde music scene, she was invited to the Composer-to-Composer festival directed by Charles Amirkhanian in Telluride, Colorado in 1989 and joined the one-week residency with John Cage and selected leading composers. Kim premiered her commissioned works predominately in New York City and travels worldwide performing. Kim lives in Connecticut and teaches in the Music Department at Wesleyan University. Instruments Jin Hi Kim with komungo Jin Hi Kim's primary instrument is the geomungo, though she also plays Korean percussion instruments such as janggo and dancer‚Äôs barrel drum set. With the Toronto instrument builder Joseph Yanuziello in 1998 Kim co-designed and now plays the electric komungo, for which she has created numerous interactive pieces with a MIDI computer system using MAX/MSP programmed by Alex Noyes. In collaboration with Alex Noyes Kim is developing komungobot, an algorithmic robotic instrument. Career and works Kim has released 15 CDs, including Living Tones, Komungo, Pulses, Komunguitar, Sargeng, No World Improvisations, and Sound Universe. = Cross-cultural compositions: Living Tones = Jin Hi Kim's compositions for Korean and Western instruments (both alone and in combination) have as their central focus the exploration of the Korean concept of shigimse (ÏãúÍπÄÏÉà), the technique of ornamentation used in traditional vocal and instrumental music. Although the term's literal meaning is not known, in 1985 Kim began to use the term \\"living tones\\" to describe this attitude toward melodic material as she applied it in her work. Thus, her compositions use newly developed forms of notation to indicate various types of vibrato, pitch bends, etc. in order that, as in Korean traditional music, each musical tone is given a unique expression and development. Kim's Living Tones CD features her signature bi- cultural compositions Nong Rock for string quartet and komungo, Tchong for flute and daegum, Piri Quartet for oboe/English horn with three piri(s) and Yoeum for kagok singer and baritone. In 1986 she began to be recognized as a composer when she was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet for her work Linking. Jin Hi Kim is both composer and soloist for the following compositions: Nong Rock for the Kronos Quartet premiered at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center in 1992; Voices of Sigimse for Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center premiered at the Lincoln Center Summer Festival 1996 with Tan Dun conducting; Eternal Rock (2001) for American Composers Orchestra premiered at Carnegie Hall; and Tilings (2013) for Either/Or Ensemble conducted by Richard Carrick premiered at The Kitchen (NYC). Kim also has introduced Korean tall and colorful barrel drums in the orchestra. Eternal Rock II (2006) was commissioned and premiered by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, conducted by Gil Rose with Gerry Hemingway as soloist on drums. Monk Dance (2007) was commissioned and premiered by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra with Kim as soloist on the drums and Jung-Ho Pak conducting. Kim was Music Alive Composer-in-Residence with New Haven Symphony Orchestra (2009-2011) for which she premiered her commissioned Nori III for electric komungo and percussion quartet. In 1998 Kim was featured composer for the Festival Nieuwe Muziek and Agate Slice was commissioned for Xenakis Ensemble (the Netherlands). Kim also performed her compositions as soloist with Empire State Youth Orchestra, Stanford Symphony, KBS Symphony (Korea), Zeitgeist, and Kairos String Quartet (Berlin). =Sociopolitical compositions= Responding to two wars involving American military in Asia, Jin Hi Kim composed two pieces, Child of War (2014) and One Sky (2005). A mixed choral piece, Child of War was dedicated to Kim Phuc who is renowned for ‚Äòthe girl in the picture' during the Vietnam War, was commissioned by John Marshall Lee and world premiered by The Mendelssohn Choir of Connecticut and Kim, conducted by Carole Ann Maxwell at Quick Center, Fairfield University. One Sky (2005), for chamber string orchestra and electric komungo, is dedicated to the reunification of North and South Korea, which was commissioned and performed by the Great Mountain Music Festival Orchestra, with Kim as soloist, at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ); Kim was featured on BBC The World/Global Hit radio program directed by Marco Werman for her One Sky; and the work was broadcast on KBS TV. In collaboration with artist David Chung at the University of Michigan, Kim composed two soundtracks: Pyongyang, a multimedia installation, and Koryo Saram, an hour long documentary film about Korean refugees from Russia to Kazakhstan which was presented at Harvard University, Princeton University, Smithsonian Institution Freer Gallery of Art, and the Sackler Gallery (Washington, DC) and international film festivals including S√£n Paulo International Film Festival, Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival, San Francisco Asian American International Film Festival, Vancouver Asian Film Festival and European Film Festival. =Multimedia performances= Jin Hi Kim with electric komungo Kim has created hour-long cross-cultural multimedia works that led to a new direction incorporating Asian cultural heritage interfaced with emerging Western interactive technology. * Ghost Komungobot (2015): a true experience of mystic birds, for komungobot, electric komungo and visual design, in collaboration with Alex Noyes (interactive sound design) and Benton C Bainbridge (visual media) was co-produced by Harvestworks Digital Media Arts Center and CultureHub, The Art & Technology Center at La MaMa in New York City. Ghost Komungobot is a reflection of emerging aspects of American culture including robots, artificial intelligence, and explorations of multidimensional space in the universe. * Digital Buddha (2007-2014): a cosmic meditation, for electric komungo and komungo with video art (of Benton C Bainbridge and Joel Cadman), was performed at Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2004 and again in conjunction of 2014 Exhibition Silla; Korea's Golden Kingdom, Expo Cibao (Dominican Republic), Expo Zaragoza (Spain), Detroit Institute of Art, Korea Festival, Art & Ideas Festival (New Haven, Conn.), Festival Salihara (Indonesia), Bandung International Digital Art Festival (Indonesia), Roulette (New York City, NY), Cornell University, Yale University, Stanford Pacific-Asia Music Festival and Michigan University. Digital Buddha contrast both the neurotic intensity of American life with daily Asian meditative practice. * Touching The Moons (2000): a multi-media lunar ritual, interfaced electric komungo, Indian tabla, a Korean kagok singer, and an Indian kathak dancer with a computer-controlled MIDI system, sensors, and digital animation. Touching The Moons, won Wolff Ebermann Prize of International Theater Institute (Germany), was commissioned and premiered by The Kitchen (NYC) and performed at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Touching The Moons challenges the duality of Asian mythology and American scientific exploration of the moon. * Sanjo Ecstasy: a 90-minute improvisational form for electric komungo, gayageum, haegum, janggo, drum set, and shaman trance dancer, was premiered at the Sanjo Festival in Jeonju, South Korea in 2003. * Dragon Bond Rite (1997): a masked dance and music, juxtaposed with diverse traditions from India, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Tuva, and the United States. The work was commissioned and premiered at the Japan Society and performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. = Cross-cultural improvisations = In 1986 Kim met Henry Kaiser and was quickly introduced to many other leading guitarists in the United States and Europe. Since then, she has improvised at many international festivals with Elliott Sharp, Bill Frisell, Derek Bailey, Hans Reichel, Eugene Chadbourne, James Newton, Evan Parker, Joseph Celli, Malcolm Goldstein, Oliver Lake, Billy Bang, William Parker, Leroy Jenkins, Peter Kowald, Reggie Workman, Mark Dresser, Jo√´lle L√©andre, Jane Ira Bloom, R√ºdiger Carl, Gerry Hemingway, and many other prominent figures in new music and avant-garde jazz. For her own compositions and for collective creativity, she has improvised with traditional master artists from Asia and Africa including Kongar-Ol Ondar, Min Xiao-Fen, Wu Man, Samir Chatterjee, Mayumi Miyata, Vikku Vinayakram, Abraham Adzenyah, and Mor Thiam.  Awards  Kim received a 2001 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, which was created by John Cage and Jasper Johns. She is a recipient of the composer fellowship from Guggenheim Foundation, American Composers Orchestra, National Endowment for the Arts, MAP fund from Rockefeller Foundation, McKnight Visiting Composer, Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, Meet The Composer, Wolff Ebermann Prize of International Theater Institute, and Connecticut Commission on the Arts.

Leaders of the Free World was entirely produced by the band at Blueprint Studios in Salford, Greater Manchester, a space the band hired for the duration of their recording sessions. The album reached number 12 on the British albums chart. The band teamed up with video artists The Soup Collective to produce an integrated music and video DVD to accompany the album. In the UK there was a limited edition release of the CD and the DVD in a gatefold sleeve. When released in the US, initial limited copies contained the bonus DVD (with alternatively- colored green artwork). The song \\"Mexican Standoff\\" was also recorded in Spanish.

It began on November 6, 1984, after California voters passed Proposition 37, the California State Lottery Act of 1984, to authorize the creation of a lottery. The first tickets were sold on October 3, 1985. Lottery Act The California State Lottery Act of 1984 was intended to provide more money to schools without imposing extra taxes. Accordingly, the Lottery was required to provide at least 34% of its revenues to public education, supplementing (not replacing) other funds provided by California. Another 50% of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of prizes, making a mandated minimum of 84% of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education. The remainder, a maximum of 16%, was to be spent on administration, such as salaries and running the games. On April 8, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law Assembly Bill 142 (Hayashi, D-Hayward).04/08/2010 Legislative Update , Press Releases, Office of the Governor, State of California Amending the Lottery Act, this bill reallocates Lottery revenues \\"so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education.\\" As an urgency statute, this bill took effect immediately. The new allocation increased to at least 87% the portion of Lottery revenue returned to the public, and correspondingly decreased to a maximum of 13% the amount spent on administration. It then specified that \\"not less than 50% of the total annual Lottery revenues, in an amount to be determined by the commission, be returned to the public in the form of prizes.\\" This leaves \\"the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the benefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education.\\" It also imposed requirements \\"to ensure continued growth in Lottery net revenues allocated to public education\\", with annual procedures that would, \\"in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure, ... provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1, and the prior law to be restored\\", if those requirements were not then met.AB 142 (Hayashi): California State Lottery.

History The California State Lottery began on November 6, 1984, when a majority (58%) of California voters passed Proposition 37, the California State Lottery Act of 1984, authorizing the creation of a lottery. On January 29, 1985, Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the first Lottery commissioners: William Johnston, Laverta Montgomery, John Price, Howard Varner, and Kennard Webster. The Lottery Act mandated an extremely tight timeline for establishing the Lottery and bringing it to operational status. To comply, the state government immediately built the Lottery's original headquarters in only three months in the Richards neighborhood of Sacramento (just north of downtown), where it has been located ever since. Governor Deukmejian appointed the Lottery's first director, Mark Michalko, formerly Ohio Lottery legal counsel, in May 1985. The first lottery games were Scratchers; sales began on October 3, 1985. A weekly Lotto game began a year later on October 14, 1986. In 1996, as a result of a lawsuit by Indian tribes, the Supreme Court of California unanimously struck down the lottery's implementation of keno, ruling that it was a house-banked game, not a lottery game, which at that time was illegal anywhere in California.Western Telcon, Inc. v. California State Lottery, 13 Cal. 4th 475, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 812, 917 P.2d 651 (1996). In her opinion for the court, Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar explained that the California Penal Code and case law interpreting the Penal Code have traditionally distinguished between a \\"lottery\\" and a \\"banked game\\" or \\"banking game\\", and it was the intent of the state electorate in enacting the Lottery Act to allow only a \\"lottery\\". In a true \\"lottery\\", the players play against each other; in a \\"banked game\\", they play each other and against the house. The critical distinction between the two is that a bank in a \\"banked game\\" can be broken based purely upon whether each of the individual bets is won or lost; the house unconditionally promises to pay prizes on all winning bets with no maximum ceiling. The high court explained that while this definition of a lottery does not prohibit fixed-prize lotteries, such lotteries are valid only if the total prize amount and the maximum number of fixed prizes to be won are fixed before the draw. Subsequently, California Attorney General Dan Lungren also ruled that Daily 3, which at the time had fixed payouts, also was illegal because it created an interest on the part of the state that fewer people should win, contrary to a lottery where the operator has no stake in the outcome of the draw.http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/opinions/pdfs/96-1003.pdf In response to these rulings, the Lottery modified Keno and created Hot Spot, which has a pari-mutuel payout format, and modified Daily 3 to a pari-mutuel format where payouts vary depending on the number of individuals who picked the winning numbers. California joined Mega Millions on June 22, 2005; it became the 12th jurisdiction to offer the game, and the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion with Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). A Mega Millions drawing was held in Hollywood to commemorate the event. In September 2011, the California Lottery moved into a new $58 million headquarters at 700 North 10th Street across the street from the old one, which it promptly demolished. Because it was built in a frantic 90-day rush to comply with the Lottery Act, the original headquarters had numerous construction defects in the roof, foundation, and elevator, as well as a mold problem. California, while initially never desiring to offer Mega Millions's rival Powerball, was briefly a member of the MUSL because an \\"international\\" lottery game that would have included a number of US lotteries was planned; however, the game never came to fruition. However, in February 2012 the California Lottery initiated an impact analysis of the Powerball game, in preparation for a recommendation in July 2012.http://www.calottery.com/about- us/lottery-commission/commission- schedule/~/media/1104204EB74141CB867C45AD1774A104.ashx Subsequently, the Fiscal Year 2012‚Äì2013 Business Plan included funding for a launch of Powerball within the fiscal year,http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery- commission/commission-schedule/~/media/5557D8E2A5BC4355BEC90D983579B158.ashx with Powerball launching in California on April 8, 2013. As a result of the California Supreme Court's decision, California is the only state with variable payouts for both games.

A player who bought a $5 Fantasy 5 ticket used to get a coupon to mail in for a \\"second-chance\\" drawing to be on the Make Me a Millionaire show, or to play the Dream Machine on the first TV show, The Big Spin. That drawing was cancelled in July 2010 and now players receive a \\"second-chance\\" coupon with a twenty digit code. Players can enter those codes at www.calottery.com/fan5 to be entered into a weekly drawing for a cash prize ranging from $1,000 to $10,000.Make Me a Millionaire , California State Lottery SuperLotto Plus SuperLotto Plus is a lotto game played in the style of Mega Millions. SuperLotto Plus is drawn every Wednesday and Saturday. The game began in 1986 as California SuperLotto. In 2000, the name was changed to SuperLotto Plus. Its starting jackpot is $7 million (annuitized); a cash option is available for jackpot winners. While the cash option usually is chosen, the SuperLotto Plus annuity is graduated. As of the May 11, 2013 drawing, the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30-payment graduated annuity stream, similar to that of Mega Millions, partly in response to low long-term interest rates. The cash value is now guaranteed. The graduated payments begin at 1.81% of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56% (more than triple that of the first payment) of the advertised jackpot amount.http://www.calottery.com/play/draw-games/superlotto-plus/SLP-jackpot- change-advisoryhttp://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery- commission/commission-schedule/~/media/0FC56CB28A7940A78451FCBDA591FF10.pdf Previously, the first payment was 2.5% of the annuity value (or share) of the jackpot, with the second installment 2.7%. The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 percentage point yearly, so that the final (26th) installment represented 5.1% of the annuity. Hot Spot Hot Spot is a quick-draw keno style game. The game was updated on August 1, 2011, to allow players to choose to play any number of \\"spots\\" from 1 through 10 from a pool of numbers from 01 through 80. A new higher top prize of $100,000 was also offered for 10 spot play. Previously, players could only choose to play 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 spots. Wagering can be either $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, or $20, for a maximum of 100 consecutive draws. In addition, players can choose a Bulls-Eye wager for each draw, hoping to hit the 1 number out of the 20 numbers drawn that is selected as the bulls-eye number. Drawings occur every day and every four minutes from 6:00 am until 2:00 am. Lottery retailers have monitors that display Hot Spot drawings and recent results from other Lottery games.Draw Times & Dates California State Lottery. Retrieved 2011-04-04. Fixed prizes are awarded. To meet the pari-mutuel requirements, a continuous \\"wagered prize fund\\" is created from 63% of gross sales, which ensures that the fixed payouts are met under normal circumstances, and calls for reductions should an unusually large number of individuals win a particular prize. If the wagered prize fund exceeds $2.9 million, prize augmentation and promotions are created to distribute the excess funds.http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery- commission/commission-schedule/~/media/B7C34ADC7ACE4997BC0DA17D48B6757E.pdf =Multi-jurisdictional games= The CSL's involvement in multi-state games includes part-time employees stationed in Atlanta (for Mega Millions) and Tallahassee, Florida (for Powerball), or wherever each game may be drawn, in order to fulfill the Lottery Act's requirement that a CSL employee supervises and audits the drawings for each game offered.http://www.calottery.com/about- us/lottery-commission/meetings- archive/2012-meetings/~/media/D94ED4631920443695B3FA2C884CDE58.pdf Mega Millions In 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as part of his redesign of California government, suggested that California join a multi-jurisdictional lottery. In June 2005, the Lottery Commission voted to join Mega Millions.Tran Bill Signed by Governor to Keep Education Dollars Flowing from State Lottery California Chronicle, April 23, 2008. Retrieved 2011-04-04. California is unique among the 45 Mega Millions participants in that all nine prize levels for Mega Millions within its borders are always parimutuel, rather than each non-jackpot prize having a set value. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. For example, the \\"advertised\\" second prize in Mega Millions is $1,000,000; it is not unheard of for that prize level to pay over $1.9 million to a California second-prize winner.http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/numbers-drawn- for-400m-mega-millions-jackpot/ The second prize pool within California frequently rolls; it is, in effect, a \\"secondary jackpot\\". Unlike the other Mega Millions members, California currently does not offer the Megaplier, which is drawn in Texas by a random number generator. Powerball In February 2012, as a response to declining sales and low per-capita revenue from the lottery, California Lottery management initiated a review of whether Powerball would be appropriate for the state.http://www.calottery.com/about- us/lottery-commission/meetings- archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1104204EB74141CB867C45AD1774A104.ashx In September 2012, the Lottery Commission approved management's request to launch Powerball in April 2013, citing a net increase in revenue of $90 to $120 million as a result of Powerball, desiring to avoid the launch of a $20 scratcher in fall 2013. In November 2012, California promulgated the regulations for Powerball in the state. Similar to Mega Millions, all non jackpot draws in the state are within an intrastate pool, with California sending its jackpot share (30% of draw sales) to MUSL for addition to the multi-state jackpot pool. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. Each pool for a particular prize category will rollover, thus the \\"pick 5\\" prize will create a secondary jackpot similar to the \\"pick 5\\" payout in California's implementation of Mega Millions. Also, as a result of the California Supreme Court ruling which mandates pari-mutuel payouts, California will not participate in the PowerPlay multiplier option.http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings- archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1B46A261DC554507859EAFC41C71DC69.pdfhttp://www.10news.com/money/consumer/powerball- tickets-go-on-sale-in-califonia-for-first-time-statewide04082013 California launched Powerball on April 8, 2013, with the first drawing on April 10, 2013.

The Big Spin The Big Spin, the California Lottery's first game show, broadcast its final episode on January 10, 2009, ending its run as the longest-running lottery game show in the US. The Lottery had several methods for choosing contestants, including prizes in Scratchers games and \\"second-chance\\" drawings from other games. The top prize was fixed at $3 million; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750. While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009, winners who would previously have spun the wheel on The Big Spin had the option to spin the wheel‚Äîuntelevised‚Äîas an alternative to going to the Make Me a Millionaire show, which succeeded The Big Spin. Following the show's ending in 2009, the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage, and decided to preserve The Big Spin wheel as part of a permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento. Guests are invited to spin the wheel for fun without cash prizes.

The second game is Safe Cracker, in which two players competed for prizes ranging from $2,000 to $92,000. Next is California Cool, with one player and prizes ranging from $5,000 to $200,000. The last game is Millionaire, also for one player; it guaranteed $10,000 with a jackpot that began at $1 million, increasing by $200,000 each week until won. Scratchers California sells scratch cards under the branding \\"Scratchers\\". The prizes are smaller than other lottery games, but there are better odds (averaging 1:5). There are dozens of Scratchers games on sale at any time, and the selection of games changes frequently. Winners must be claimed within 180 days of the announced end-of-game date.Claiming Prizes , California State LotteryEnd of Game Information, California State Lottery Scratchers range in price from $1 to $30. A $20 scratcher, \\"$5 Million Jackpot\\", was introduced September 25, 2013. To commemorate the Lottery's 30th anniversary, on August 24, 2015, a $30 Scratcher \\"California Lottery 30th Anniversary\\" was launched. Claiming prizes For each prize of less than $600, players may collect from either a Lottery retailer or the Lottery itself. Prizes of $600 or more must be collected from the Lottery, via claim form. =Claim period= Almost all prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw or the announced end of the game. If the 180th day is a weekend or holiday, the final claim date is extended to the next business day. Any unclaimed prize money is transferred to the education fund in addition to the minimum 34% that the Lottery is already obligated to transfer from income. Because many of the 44 Mega Millions participants have a one-year claim period, the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act. On April 23, 2008, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Member Van Tran's Assembly Bill 1251, modifying California Government Code section 8880.321 to allow for a one-year claim period for a Mega Millions jackpot prize.Assembly Bill No. 1251 Official California Legislative Information, the Legislative Counsel of California. Retrieved 2011-04-04. This is the only prize in California that has a one-year claim period. All other prizes have the 180-day claim period. This legislation affected Mega Millions drawings after July 5, 2008. =Payment options= All prizes for Fantasy 5, Daily Derby, Daily 3, Daily 4, and non-jackpot SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball prizes, are paid out in one payment, less 24% or 33% (depending upon the winner's tax documentation) Federal withholding if the prize is over $5,000. Merchandise prizes over $5,000 are subject to 33% Federal withholding. Scratchers tickets are generally one-payment prizes; however, some games have annuity options for payments each year, or per week. California does not tax California Lottery winnings, however it taxes lottery winnings from other jurisdictions.Instructions for Schedule CA (540), Page 5, Line 21, State of California Franchise Tax Board For SuperLotto Plus and Mega Millions jackpots, the player may choose a single cash payout for a floating percentage of the jackpot, or an annuity. The SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball payment schedule are on a graduated basis over 30 annual payments. Until 2005, when California joined Mega Millions, the payment choice on SuperLotto Plus had to be made when the ticket was bought. Since then, there is a 60-day window after winning, in which the choice of cash or annuity is to be made. Unclaimed prizes Unclaimed prizes remaining after the claim period expires always go to supporting California's public schools. As of the end of FY 2013‚Äì14, a total of $793.5 million in unclaimed prizes have been awarded to education.

The dam serves at once four distinct purposes: it generates hydroelectricity; it regulates and limits flooding; it releases stored water to permit year-round navigation on the lower Cumberland River; and it creates Lake Cumberland for recreation, which has become a popular tourist attraction. Because of seepage problems in the dam's foundation, it has become the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers's top dam priority. U.S. Route 127 is built on top of the dam. Construction Construction of the Wolf Creek Dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and the River Harbor Act of 1946 as part of a comprehensive plan to develop the Cumberland River Basin. Construction began in 1941 but because of World War II and other factors, construction was not completed until 1951.Wolf Creek Dam USACE Brochure Lake Cumberland is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being J. Percy Priest Dam, Dale Hollow Dam, and Center Hill Dam. The last of the power generators was installed in 1952. While several small towns were adversely affected by the construction of the dam, such as nearby Creelsboro (downstream) and Burnside (upstream), the dam is credited with preventing several hundred million dollars in flood damage. Characteristics Wolf Creek Dam, 2011 Water was released through the floodgates--at a rate of --for the first time in 11 years, in March 2015 The Wolf Creek Dam is a long and high dam with a combined earthen and concrete structure. The concrete section of the Wolf Creek Dam consists of 37 gravity monoliths that comprise of the dam's length, across the old river channel. The spillway section contains ten tainter gates and six low level sluice gates. The power intake section contains the penstocks that feed the six 45 MW turbines. The embankment section extends from the end of the concrete gravity portion across the valley to the right abutment. It has a maximum height of above the top of rock. The non-zoned embankment is composed of well-compacted, low plasticity clays, from the valley alluvium.Milestone construction at Wolf Creek dam - International Water Power and Dam Construction - 19 June 2009 Seepage In 1968, signs of seepage problems within Wolf Creek Dam's earthen embankments and foundation were discovered. Sinkholes appeared at the downstream toe of the dam, and muddy water was observed in the dam's outflow channel. The seepage problems were traced to the karst geology of the region which allows for the dissolution of limestone in the dam's foundation. Seepage Problem, Wolf Creek Dam U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Accessed 27 January 2007. Solution channels caused by this process allow piping to occur, which adds to the rate of erosion in the foundation. The dam and its adjacent reservoir reside upon a heavy Karst bedrock foundation. Karst formations are large void spaces lying beneath seemingly solid species of limestone bedrock. Karst formations are created when limestone bedrocks are, over time, attacked by water through natural precipitation seepage. The rain or snowmelt water contains dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which, in solution, forms a weak carbonic acid. That acid attacks the limestone rock dissolving it and thereby leading to the voids within the rock formation. When a reservoir of 100+ feet in elevation is raised above this style of foundation, the hydraulic pressure of the water easily dislodges the cementing clays that are in the cracks and void spaces of the underlying Karst foundation. Keying a concrete dam's footing form into such a foundation; along with injecting waterproof grout into the void spaces between the dam's concrete base and the rock foundation (so as to fill the foundation's voids) will usually create a watertight seal above, at, and below the foundation of a concrete dam, in a Karst locale. However Wolf Creek is primarily an earth fill embankment dam. In this form of construction the majority of the dam's structure (measured by length across the streambed) is a nominally waterproof earth fill embankment body, with only the powerhouse and (if so equipped) the controlled overflow spillway section located within a concrete monolith. In the particular case of Wolf Creek dam, the earth embankment section is placed directly upon the formerly existing streambed; with only the surface soils and clays removed. While the upstream interface between the embankment section's foot and the old streambed is nominally waterproof, the Karst solution channels far under the mass of the earth embankment section proper, can directly attack the porous and not waterproofed foundation of the earth embankment section of the dam. It is this phenomenon that has occurred and led directly to the seepage problem. A short-term solution of grouting the existing seepage channels was employed immediately; grouting in the dam foundation ran from 1968 to 1970 and is credited with saving the dam. Construction of a long-term solution began in 1975 in the form of a seepage cut-off wall. A concrete diaphragm wall was chosen as the appropriate cut-off solution and extended through the earth embankment into the rock foundation. The cut-off wall was completed in 1979. =Recent events= Despite efforts to stem the seepage, continuous monitoring of the dam shows that seepage problems have not been completely alleviated and are increasing. Reports of seepage has caused public worry and if Wolf Creek Dam fails, the USACE estimates US $3 billion in property damage.Q's & A's, Wolf Creek Dam U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Accessed 27 January 2007. Seepage has likely found new paths around, and possibly through, the cut-off wall previously placed.Project Manager's Assessment, Wolf Creek Dam U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Accessed 27 January 2007. Since March 2005, around the time when increased seepage rates were discovered, Lake Cumberland has been held at nearly constant water levels to reduce the stresses placed on the structure and its foundation. In late January 2007, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers placed the dam under a 'high risk' for failure designation, along with Center Hill Dam in Tennessee, both of which are two major dams upstream from Nashville, Tennessee. A new long-term solution was proposed to solve, or control, the current seepage problem. A grout curtain and a new concrete diaphragm wall of greater dimensions will be constructed with newer technologies. To reduce the stresses on Wolf Creek Dam, and thus the risk, the Corps planned to lower Lake Cumberland to , lower than normal summer levels.Bradley, Jeff, et al. (11 April 2007) Wolf Creek Dam Consensus Report: Engineering Risk and Reliability Analysis U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Accessed 21 October 2007. However, this will affect up to 200,000 area citizens' water supply and has also met resistance from marina owners, so the water level has remained at below normal. This 40 ft. lowered lake level is to be held for an indefinite amount of time and will be subject to frequent review. In October 2007, warning sirens were installed in counties downstream from the dam.(20 October 2007) Wolf Creek Dam Issues Prompt Siren Installation WTVF. Nashville, TN. Accessed 20 October 2007.(20 October 2007) New Warning System for Several Counties Near Wolf Creek Dam WKBO. Bowling Green, KY. Accessed 20 October 2007. Phase one remedial work began in March 2006. Phase two, which includes grouting the dam's foundation, began in January 2007. In April 2009, construction began on a new concrete barrier wall within the embankment of the Wolf Creek Dam. The concrete wall was planned for completion in 2012 at a cost of US $584 million. A risk-benefit analysis suggests a 7:1 benefit. In 2010, the Commonwealth of Kentucky proposed a new route for US 127 that would cross the Cumberland River in the first bend downstream, potentially removing traffic from atop the dam. Timing of the project is uncertain.http://transportation.ky.gov/progmgmt/sypmaps/print/russell.pdf The barrier wall begun in 2009 was completed in 2013 and lake levels returned to normal in 2014.http://www.lrn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Current- Projects/Construction/Wolf-Creek-Dam-Safety-Rehabilitation-Project/ ReferencesExternal links *Lake Cumberland Online Visitor's Guide *Wolf Creek Dam - US Army Corps of Engineers *Potential Flooding Maps available online.

It is made from a mix of sour tasting apples, such as \\"Bohnapfel\\" or \\"Speierling\\", respectively. It has an alcohol content of 4.8‚Äì7.0% and a tart, sour taste. Apfelwein is also regionally known as Ebbelwoi, √Ñppler, St√∂ffsche, Apfelmost (apple must), Viez (from Latin vice, the second or substitute wine), and saurer Most (sour must, S√º√ümost or sweet must is essentially apple juice). Instead of the name √Ñppler, restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage Schoppen or Schoppe, which actually refers to the measure of the glass. In the Frankfurt area, berries from the service tree (Sorbus domestica) may be added in small quantities to increase astringency, in which case the specific type of Apfelwein is called Speierling. In modern times, the term Speierling is often also used to refer to any more sour variety of Apfelwein, even if it lacks any juice of the service tree. Production Apfelwein is made from pressed apples. The juice or must is fermented with yeast to produce an alcoholic beverage usually around 6% abv. It can be made with the addition of the unprocessed juice from the fruit of a small, indigenous tree known as Speierling (Sorbus domestica) or Speyerling, an endangered species that is easily confused with the wild apple. Apfelwein is mainly produced and consumed in Hesse (where it is the state beverage), particularly in the Frankfurt, Wetterau, and Odenwald areas. It is also found in Moselfranken, Merzig (Saarland), and the Trier area, as well as the lower Saar area and the region bordering on Luxembourg. Several large producers are located in these regions, as well as numerous small, private producers which use traditional recipes. Some of the most famous restaurants where Apfelwein is served are in Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main). Some of these regions have regular cider competitions and fairs, in which the small, private producers participate. Cider songs are composed and sung at these events. The Merzig region crowns a \\"Viez Queen\\", and the lower Saar area a \\"Viez King\\".

Their blend of Cantopop, synthpop, new wave and electronic dance music with lyrics which reflected contemporary social, political, and literary themes, made them one of the first alternative and most influential bands of the 1980s Hong Kong music scene. The band enjoyed critical and commercial success until a hiatus in 1990. After their breakup, Wong proceeded as a solo artist while Lau went into acting although the duo have reunited several times over the years. On 3 January 2019, the duo received the Golden Needle Award for their outstanding musical contributions at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. Music career=Formation: 1985= Tats Lau and Anthony Wong Yiu-ming met in 1985 when Wong was working as a DJ for Commercial Radio Hong Kong. Wong answered a singer-wanted advert placed in a music magazine by instrumentalist Lau, who had created two previous bands known as DLLM and Oriental Electronic Orchestra. The two discovered that they had a mutual interest in electronic music and they began working on original material. Lau became the main music composer of their songs. Hong Kong radio personality Winnie Yu christened them as \\"Tat Ming Pair\\" and they were signed to PolyGram Records. =Initial years: 1986‚Äì1991= The band provided an alternative to the mainstream pop/rock bands of the time due to their melodious synth-based music and politically conscious lyrics combined with themes drawn from classic literature. Their music was influenced by British musicians including Pet Shop Boys and David Bowie. Due to the pitch-sensitive tonal nature of Cantonese, pairing Cantonese lyrics with the western-style musical scale can be a difficult process. Thus they began their ongoing collaboration with lyricists such as Calvin Poon Yuen- Leung (ÊΩòÊ∫êËâØ), Yiu-Fai Chow (Âë®ËÄÄËºù) and Keith Chan Siu-Kei. The majority of their album art was directed by famed designer William Chang. They released their first mini-album Tat Ming Pair (ÈÅîÊòé‰∏ÄÊ¥æ) in March 1986, followed by their debut full-length LP Tat Ming Pair II (ÈÅîÊòé‰∏ÄÊ¥æII) in September of the same year. The cover of their debut EP contained an image prominently displaying Wong's long hair, a hairstyle which was considered subversive for men at the time in Hong Kong. Selected songs from their first full-length album were included in the 1986 film Kiss Me Good-Bye (ÊàÄÊÑõÂ≠£ÁØÄ) starring Wong and Loletta Lee. Their second full-length album The Story of the Stone (Áü≥È†≠Ë®ò) was released in 1987 and contained some of their biggest hit songs such as the title track, \\"Angels of the Road (È¶¨Ë∑ØÂ§©‰Ωø)\\" and \\"Rear Window (ÂæåÁ™ó)\\". An instrumental version of the title track was included as the opening theme for the film Golden Swallow (ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê) starring Wong and Cherie Chung. The film's soundtrack also included an alternate recording of their song \\"Searching For Love (ÊÉÖÊé¢)\\". They continued to produce innovative records and their January 1988 release I Shall Wait For Your Return (ÊàëÁ≠âÁùÄ‰Ω†Âõû‰æÜ) was considered Hong Kong's first concept album. The album theme dealt with the ongoing emigration of Hong Kong residents due to an uncertain political status after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The album won the award for Best Record Design at the 1988 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards in which the band also won the award for Best Performance. In June 1988, they released Do You Still Love Me? (‰Ω†ÈÇÑÊÑõÊàëÂóé). The album contains one of their most famous songs \\"A Murder Unannounced in Advance (Ê≤íÊúâÂºµÊèöÁöÑÂëΩÊ°à)\\". The album is also noted for containing the song \\"Forbidden Colors (Á¶ÅËâ≤)\\" which was one of the first songs in the Hong Kong music industry to deal with homosexuality and has since become a LGBT anthem. The title of the song was inspired by Yukio Mishima's novel and the song has been covered by other artists including Denise Ho and Eason Chan and was featured in the 1992 Evans Chan film To Liv(e). They released Fallen Angel (ÊÑèÈõ£Âπ≥) in 1989, the original Chinese title being taken from a line in Dream of the Red Chamber. The album was partially influenced by Spanish guitar melodies. The album lyrically contained varying themes such as \\"Love in the Time of Cholera (ÊÑõÂú®ÁòüÁñ´ËîìÂª∂ÊôÇ)\\" which was a dedication to victims of AIDS. The album is also lauded for containing the song \\"Forget He Or She (ÂøòË®ò‰ªñÊòØÂ•π)\\" the first song on the Hong Kong music scene to examine gender fluidity. On May 27, 1989, the band participated in the Concert for Democracy in China which was a benefit concert held at Happy Valley Racecourse in support of the students involved in the Tiananmen Square protests. The event lasted for 12 hours and raised over 1.5 million USD for the students in Beijing. Their final release before their initial hiatus was 1990's acclaimed Nerves (Á•ûÁ∂ì), another concept album which contained many songs relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and unease towards the upcoming 1997 handover of Hong Kong such as \\"The Ten Young Firemen (ÂçÅÂÄãÊïëÁÅ´ÁöÑÂ∞ëÂπ¥)\\" and \\"Don't Ask The Sky (Â§©Âïè)\\". In 1991, the duo split amicably over a difference in musical opinion and a desire to pursue other work. =Solo careers: 1991‚Äì1996= After their separation, Lau formed several musical projects including Tats Lau and Dream (Âäâ‰ª•ÈÅîËàáÂ§¢) and wrote songs for other singers. Lau also composed music for film soundtracks and pursued his own acting career. Wong began to collaborate with other songwriters and lyricists, such as Jason Choi (Ëî°Âæ∑Êâç) and Lin Xi. During this period, Wong released several successful albums which reached critical and commercial success. His solo career culminated in him winning the award for Best Original Song at the 1995 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards and the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards (Êñ∞ÂüéÂãÅÁàÜÈ†íÁçéÁ¶Æ) for his song \\"Before Sunrise (Êò•ÂÖâ‰πçÊ¥©)\\". The video for \\"Before Sunrise (Êò•ÂÖâ‰πçÊ¥©)\\" was directed by Susie Au and cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle. =Reunion: 1996‚Äìpresent= The band reunited in 1996 to celebrate their 10-year anniversary and released a new single \\"A Forbidden Fruit Once Per Day (ÊØèÊó•‰∏ÄÁ¶ÅÊûú)\\" which won the top prize at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards (Âè±Âí§Ê®ÇÂ£áÊµÅË°åÊ¶ú). They released their album Viva! Viva! Viva! (Ëê¨Ê≠≤ÔºÅËê¨Ê≠≤ÔºÅËê¨Ëê¨Ê≠≤) in October 1996, staging a large-scale concert filmed at Queen Elizabeth Stadium the same month. They also released a live album entitled Viva! Viva! Viva!: The Concert (Ëê¨Ê≠≤ÔºÅËê¨Ê≠≤ÔºÅËê¨Ëê¨Ê≠≤ÔºÅÔºÅÊºîÂî±ÊúÉ) in 1997. The duo once again parted ways to focus on solo work, not reuniting again until 2004 for the release of the single \\"Blessed are the Lonely Ones (ÂØÇÂØûÁöÑ‰∫∫ÊúâÁ¶è‰∫Ü)\\". In July 2005, they released the album The Party for their 20th anniversary. They once again staged more large-scale concerts filmed at the Hong Kong Coliseum, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the Shanghai Indoor Stadium. The duo also released the live album At the Service Of The People (ÁÇ∫‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊúçÂãôÊºîÂî±ÊúÉ). They once again reunited in 2012 to release a single \\"It's My Party\\" to celebrate their 25th anniversary. They also held a four-night residency concert in April 2012 at the Hong Kong Coliseum entitled ÂÖúÂÖúËΩâËΩâÊºîÊºîÂî±Âî±ÊúÉ which resulted in another live album and DVD. The duo celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2017 with a series of concerts once again at the Hong Kong Coliseum and they also released the maxi single \\"1+4=14\\". They released the live album ÈÅîÊòéÂçÖ‰∏ÄÊ¥æÂ∞ç in November 2017. On January 3rd 2019, the duo received the Golden Needle Award due to their success and artistic influence on the Hong Kong music scene. In April 2019, all of the band's music was removed from Apple Music and other music streaming sites in mainland China as a result of censorship by the Chinese government due to the political and democratic nature of their songs. In May 2019, they released the song \\"Memory Is A Crime (ÂõûÊÜ∂ÊúâÁΩ™)\\" in honor of the 30th anniversary of the victims of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. It was composed by Lau with lyrics by Lin Xi. The song topped the iTunes chart in Hong Kong but was immediately banned in mainland China where discussion involving the protests and the violent military response is forbidden. On June 4th 2019, Wong performed the song live during the annual Tiananmen Square vigil in Victoria Park.

A resist can be patterned via lithography to form a (sub)micrometer-scale, temporary mask that protects selected areas of the underlying substrate during subsequent processing steps. The material used to prepare said thin layer is typically a viscous solution. Resists are generally proprietary mixtures of a polymer or its precursor and other small molecules (e.g. photoacid generators) that have been specially formulated for a given lithography technology. Resists used during photolithography are called photoresists.  Background  Semiconductor devices (as of 2005) are built by depositing and patterning many thin layers. The patterning steps, or lithography, define the function of the device and the density of its components. For example, in the interconnect layers of a modern microprocessor, a conductive material (copper or aluminum) is inlaid in an electrically insulating matrix (typically fluorinated silicon dioxide or another low-k dielectric). The metal patterns define multiple electrical circuits that are used to connect the microchip's transistors to one another and ultimately to external devices via the chip's pins. The most common patterning method used by the semiconductor device industry is photolithography -- patterning using light. In this process, the substrate of interest is coated with photosensitive resist and irradiated with short- wavelength light projected through a photomask, which is a specially prepared stencil formed of opaque and transparent regions - usually a quartz substrate with a patterned chromium layer. The shadow of opaque regions in the photomask forms a submicrometer-scale pattern of dark and illuminated regions in the resist layer -- the areal image. Chemical and physical changes occur in the exposed areas of the resist layer. For example, chemical bonds may be formed or destroyed, inducing a change in solubility. This latent image is then developed for example by rinsing with an appropriate solvent. Selected regions of the resist remain, which after a post-exposure bake step form a stable polymeric pattern on the substrate. This pattern can be used as a stencil in the next process step. For example, areas of the underlying substrate that are not protected by the resist pattern may be etched or doped. Material may be selectively deposited on the substrate. After processing, the remaining resist may be stripped. Sometimes (esp. during Microelectromechanical systems fabrication), the patterned resist layer may be incorporated in the final product. Many photolithography and processing cycles may be performed to create complex devices. Resists may also be formulated to be sensitive to charged particles, such as the electron beams produced in scanning electron microscopes. This is the basis of electron-beam direct-write lithography. A resist is not always necessary. Several materials may be deposited or patterned directly using techniques like soft lithography, Dip-Pen Nanolithography, evaporation through a shadow mask or stencil.  Typical process  # Resist Deposition: The precursor solution is spin-coated on a clean (semiconductor) substrate, such as a silicon wafer, to form a very thin, uniform layer. # Soft Bake: The layer is baked at a low temperature to evaporate residual solvent. # Exposure: A latent image is formed in the resist e.g. (a) via exposure to ultraviolet light through a photomask with opaque and transparent regions or (b) by direct writing using a laser beam or electron beam. # Post-Exposure Bake # Development: Areas of the resist that have (or have not) been exposed are removed by rinsing with an appropriate solvent. # Processing through the resist pattern: wet or dry etching, lift-off, doping... # Resist Stripping See also *Electron beam lithography *Nanolithography *Photolithography External links *MicroChem *Shipley (now Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials) *Clariant *micro resist technology Category:Semiconductor device fabrication ","title":"Resist (semiconductor fabrication)"},{"id":"2277568","text":"Kimball Union Academy is a private boarding school located in New Hampshire.

The reference to the testes (as the term balls is commonly understood to mean) of the brass monkey appears to be a 20th-century variant on the expression, prefigured by a range of references to other body parts, especially the nose and tail. History During the 19th and 20th centuries, small monkeys cast from the alloy brass were very common tourist souvenirs from China and Japan. They usually, but not always, came in a set of three representing the Three Wise Monkeys carved in wood above the Shrine of T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ in Nikk≈ç, Tochigi, Japan. These monkeys were often cast with all three in a single piece. In other sets they were made singly. Old brass monkeys of this type are collectors' items. Michael Quinion, advisor to The Oxford English Dictionary and author of the website World Wide Words, writes, \\"it's more than likely the term came from them\\". Usage Early references to \\"brass monkeys\\" in the 19th century have no references to balls at all, but instead variously say that it is cold enough to freeze the tail, nose, ears, and whiskers off a brass monkey; or hot enough to \\"scald the throat\\" or \\"singe the hair\\" of a brass monkey. * An early known recorded use of the phrase \\"brass monkey\\" appears in the humorous essay \\"On Enjoying Life\\" by Eldridge Gerry Paige (writing under the pseudonym Dow, Jr.), published in the New York Sunday Mercury and republished in the book Short Patent Sermons by Dow, Jr.: \\"When you love, [...] your heart, hands, feet and flesh are as cold and senseless as the toes of a brass monkey in winter.\\" * Another early published instance of the phrase appeared in 1847, in a portion of Herman Melville's autobiographical narrative Omoo: :\\"It was so excessively hot in this still, brooding valley, shut out from the Trades, and only open toward the leeward side of the island, that labor in the sun was out of the question. To use a hyperbolical phrase of Shorty's, 'It was 'ot enough to melt the nose h'off a brass monkey.'\\" * An early recorded mentioning of the freezing a \\"brass monkey\\" dates from 1857, appearing in C.A. Abbey, Before the Mast, p. 108: \\"It would freeze the tail off a brass monkey\\". * The story \\"Henry Gardner\\" (10 April 1858) has \\"its blowing hard enough to blow the nose off a brass monkey\\". * The poem \\"Lines on a heavy prospector and his recent doings in the North- West\\" (20 June 1865) has \\"It would freeze off a brass monkey's nose\\" * The article \\"Echoes from England\\" (23 May 1868) has \\"that same east wind ... would shave the whiskers off a brass monkey\\" * The Story of Waitstill Baxter, by Kate Douglas Wiggin (1913) has \\"The little feller, now, is smart's a whip, an' could talk the tail off a brass monkey\\". * The Ivory Trail, by Talbot Mundy (1919) has \\"He has the gall of a brass monkey\\". *Thomas Wolfe (1900‚Äì1938) wrote in one of his notebooks:The Notebooks of Thomas Wolfe, vol. 2, edited by Richard S. Kennedy and Paschal Reeves, University of North Carolina Press, 1970, p. 497. :Ernest said, \\"It would freeze the balls off a brass monkey ‚Äî that's how cold it gets.\\" *The play, \\"The Animal Kingdom\\" (1932), by Philip Barry, has the following passage: :GRACE: Well, I guess I'd better be \\"barging along,\\" as they say. I'm sure it's getting colder by the minute. :TOM: Yes‚ÄîI think we'd best bring the brass monkeys in tonight. = Cunard = The \\"brass monkey\\" is the nickname of the house flag of the Cunard Line, adopted in 1878, a lion rampant or on a field gules holding a globe. The reference is almost certainly irreverent humour, rather than a source of the expression, of which variants predate it. =Beverage= A \\"brass monkey\\" is one of any number of citrus-flavored alcoholic drinks. In 1986, the hip hop band the Beastie Boys released a single called \\"Brass Monkey\\" from their album Licensed to Ill, although the song's lyrics are focused on the cocktail of the same name. =Inventions= US Patent 4634021 (1987) describes: Supposed etymology It is often stated that the phrase originated from the use of a brass tray, called a \\"monkey\\", to hold cannonballs on warships in the 16th to 18th centuries. Supposedly, in very cold temperatures the \\"monkey\\" would contract, causing the balls to fall off. However, nearly all historians and etymologists consider this story to be a myth. This story has been discredited by the U.S. Department of the Navy,US Naval Historical Center etymologist Michael Quinion, and the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). They give five main reasons: # The OED does not record the term \\"monkey\\" or \\"brass monkey\\" being used in this way. # The purported method of storage of cannonballs (\\"round shot\\") is simply false. The shot was not stored on deck continuously on the off-chance that the ship might go into battle. Indeed, decks were kept as clear as possible. #Furthermore, such a method of storage would result in shot rolling around on deck and causing a hazard in high seas. The shot was stored on the gun or spar decks, in shot racks‚Äîlongitudinal wooden planks with holes bored into them, known as shot garlands in the Royal Navy, into which round shot was inserted for ready use by the gun crew. # Shot was not left exposed to the elements where it could rust. Such rust could lead to the ball not flying true or jamming in the barrel and exploding the gun. Indeed, gunners would attempt to remove as many imperfections as possible from the surfaces of balls. # The physics does not stand up to scrutiny. The contraction of both balls and plate over the range of temperatures involved would not be particularly large. The effect claimed possibly could be reproduced under laboratory conditions with objects engineered to a high precision for this purpose, but it is unlikely it would ever have occurred in real life aboard a warship. The reference is most likely a humorous reference to emphasize how cold it is. Also, A \\"monkey\\" was a kind of gun or cannon (usage dating to 1650). The \\"Monkey tail\\" was a short lever used for aiming the cannon. [Source: The Oxford English Dictionary. New York: Oxford University Press, 1933.] In the 1857 book Before the Mast by C.A. Abbey, it states on page 108 that, \\"It would freeze the tail off a brass monkey.\\" [Source: Lighter, J.E. ed. Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang.

He came of a family of small farmer proprietors, who had held land during three centuries. He was intended for the priesthood and entered the seminary of Floreffe, but his energies claimed a more active sphere. He left the monastery for the University of Louvain. Here he studied law, and also prepared himself for the military examinations. At that juncture the first Carlist War broke out, and Lambermont hastened to the scene of action to support catholicism and absolutism. His services were accepted (April 1838) and he was entrusted with the command of two small cannon. He also acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Durando. He greatly distinguished himself, and for his intrepidity on one occasion he was decorated with the Cross of the highest military Order of St. Ferdinand. Returning to Belgium he entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1842. He served in this department sixty-three years. He was closely associated with several of the most important questions in Belgian history during the last half of the 19th century, notably the freeing of the Scheldt. He was one of the first Belgians to see the importance of developing the trade of their country, and at his own request he was attached to the commercial branch of the foreign office. The tolls imposed by the Dutch on navigation on the Scheldt strangled Belgian trade, for Antwerp was the only port of the country. The Dutch had the right to make this levy under treaties going back to the Treaty of M√ºnster in 1648, and they clung to it still more tenaciously after Belgium separated herself in 1830-1831 from the united kingdom of the Netherlands, the London Conference in 1839 fixing the toll payable to Holland at 1.5 florins (3s.) per ton. From 1856 to 1863 Lambermont devoted most of his energies to the removal of this impediment. In 1856 he drew up a plan of action, and he prosecuted it with untiring perseverance until he saw it embodied in an international convention seven years later. Twenty-one powers and states attended a conference held on the question at Brussels in 1863, and on 15 July the treaty freeing the Scheldt was signed. For this achievement Lambermont was made a baron. Among other important conferences in which Lambermont took a leading part were those of Brussels (1874) on the usages of war, Berlin (1884‚Äì1885) on Africa and the Congo region, and Brussels (1890) of Central African affairs and the slave trade. He was joint reporter with Baron de Courcel of the Berlin Conference in 1884-1885, and on several occasions he was chosen as arbitrator by one or other of the great European powers. But his great achievement was the freeing of the Scheldt and in token of its gratitude the city of Antwerp erected a fine monument to his memory.

Tudor (later Stewart in Scotland) and earlier coifs are usually made of unadorned white linen and tied under the chin.

The traditional religious habit of Catholic nuns and Religious Sisters included a coif as a headpiece, along with the white cotton cap secured by a bandeau, to which the veil would be attached, along with a white wimple or guimpe of starched linen or cotton to cover the cheeks, neck and chest.

The exterior of Paulskirche St Paul's Church () is a Protestant church in Paulsplatz, Frankfurt am Main with important political symbolism in Germany. It is a parish of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, a United member church of the Evangelical Church in Germany. It is notable for being the seat of the 1848 Frankfurt Parliament, the first publicly and freely-elected German legislative body. History The Free City of Frankfurt, then governing its legally non-separated Lutheran state church, commissioned to construct the oval-shaped central church building in 1789. and Niels Gutschow, Kriegsschicksale deutscher Architektur: Verluste, Sch√§den, Wiederaufbau; eine Dokumentation f√ºr das Gebiet der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: 2 vols., Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 1988, vol.

Constructions halted during the Napoleonic wars. The new building was completed between 1829 and 1833 by ,Hartwig Beseler and Niels Gutschow, Kriegsschicksale deutscher Architektur: Verluste, Sch√§den, Wiederaufbau; eine Dokumentation f√ºr das Gebiet der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: 2 vols., Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 1988, vol. II: 'S√ºd', p. 811. . whereupon the organ loft was disconnected in 1833. Between 1786 and 1833 Lutheran services were held at the Old St Nicholas Church in the R√∂merberg square to the south, also owned by the free city and then actually used as garrison church for its troops. In 1830, the free city issued the \\"deeds of dotation\\" (Dotationsurkunde) fixing its long-lasting practice of owning and maintaining the church buildings in its old city centre (so-called dotation churches; Dotationskirchen), but leaving their usage to congregations of the Lutheran state church or parishes of the Catholic church, newly emancipated during the Napoleonic era. The deed of dotation statutorily established the eternal gratuitous usufruct of nine city-owned church buildings by six Lutheran congregations and three Catholic parishes. Other religious groups, such as Jews and Reformed Protestants were not part of that government funding. The entrance of the pre-parliament in St Paul's Church on 21 March 1848, by Jean Ventadour (1822‚Äì1880). Because of its typical Protestant centralised design (Predigtkirche), allowing everybody easily to hear the reverend or speaker, it was desired as the meeting place for the Frankfurt Parliament in the course of the German revolutions of 1848. From 31 March until 3 April 1848, the building was the meeting place for the Vorparlament, which prepared the election for the National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, the National Assembly met for the first time in the church, and was therefore named the Paulskirchenparlament. Until 1849, the National Assembly worked in the church to develop the first constitution for a united Germany. The resistance of Prussia, the Austrian Empire and a number of smaller German states ultimately destroyed the effort. In May 1849, there were a number of uprisings to force the implementation of the constitution,Constitution of the German Empire (\\"Constitution of Paulskirche\\") of 28 March 1849, in full text. but these were destroyed with the help of Prussia. On 30 May 1849, the Paulskirchenparlament was dissolved. After 1852, St. Paul's was again used for Lutheran services. In March 1944, during World War II, the church was destroyed along with much of the Frankfurt wider city centre in the Allied Bombing of Frankfurt. As a tribute to its symbolism of freedom and as the cradle of Germany, it was the first structure in Frankfurt the city rebuilt after the war. However, the city itself wanted to make use of the to-be- reconstructed building, thus St. Paul's Lutheran congregation and the city concluded to exchange the congregation's usufruct to this building for that of old St. Nicholas Church, only damaged by bombing. St. Paul's was reopened on the centennial of the Frankfurt Parliament. Due to financial restraints and an altered concept of use, the original inner form was dramatically altered by the architectural team of Rudolf Schwarz.

Coutts' son, Morton Coutts, took over as director in 1946, and later developed a new production process called \\"continuous fermentation\\", which enabled beer to be made continuously, without the need to stop and clean between batches. The system proved popular enough to be sold to other brewing companies.Timeline Business History. DB Breweries. Breweries DB Breweries owns and operates four breweries in New Zealand - Waitemata Brewery (Otahuhu, Auckland), Tui Brewery (Mangatainoka), DB Draught Brewery (Timaru) and Monteith's Brewery (Greymouth).http://www.db.co.nz/Our-Company-Heritage/Our-Breweries Mainland Brewery was renamed to DB Draught Brewery in 2012 in honour of the brand‚Äôs significance in the South Island. The Tui Brewery was established in 1889 by Henry Wagstaff and Edward Russell. The main brand is Tui, a 4% abv pale lager, named after a common native New Zealand bird. The New Zealand Consumers' Institute recently criticised Tui for claiming to be an \\"East India Pale Ale\\" when it is in fact a pale lager that bears little resemblance to the traditionally hoppy, bitter or malty India Pale Ale styles. Tui Brewery =Yeah right= Tui is promoted through a humorous advertising campaign which uses stereotypes, heavy irony and the phrase Yeah Right. These advertisements have caused some controversy, such as a billboard in Wellington stating 'Camilla for Queen? Yeah Right' and one stating 'Aucklanders are people too. Yeah Right'. Others to have made the news include \\"Dad's new husband seems nice - Yeah right\\" (after New Zealand legalised same-sex marriage); \\"I nvr txt whl drvn - yeah right\\"; \\"When Winston says no, he means no - Yeah right\\"; \\"Captain, I know a short cut to the port ‚Äì Yeah right\\" (after ran aground near Tauranga); \\"Our father in Heaven, Tamaki be your name ‚Äì Yeah right\\"; \\"She clearly married Dotcom for his body ‚Äì Yeah right\\". In 2010 a church was threatened with legal action after parodying the Tui billboard campaign with the slogan, \\"Atheists have nothing to worry about - Yeah Right\\". LiquorLand LiquorLand was formed in New Zealand in 1981 as a wholesale liquor chain, growing to 18 stores in its first year of business. Although it shares the name, it is not related to Liquorland in Australia. LiquorLand is a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Breweries who originated and owns the Master Franchise. Through acquisition of rival Dalgety NZ Ltd in 1982, the national chain expanded to 29 outlets. Further expansion throughout the 1980s with the acquisition of the Wilson Neill business in 1989Purchase of Wilson Neill by Brierley Investments court decision saw Liquorland reach over sixty stores. In April 2000 LiquorLand‚Äôs business model changed from being managed stores to a total franchise chain called LiquoLand Limited. Today LiquorLand has almost 80 stores nationwide with sales close to $300 million per year. In November 2008, DB Breweries sold the company to Foodstuffs for an undisclosed sum. It is understood that DB was negotiating with both Progressive Enterprises (the holding company for Woolworths' New Zealand operations) and Foodstuffs. It was understood DB made it clear that consideration of future interests for franchisees and staff, as well as the continuation of the brand as a whole, formed a major part of the decision of whom to sell to. DB officially confirmed that it was looking to continue its relationship with the franchise, retaining marketing and supply agreements.  Radler Trademark  DB trademarked the word Radler in 2003. This was contested in court by the Society of Beer Advocates who lost the case in 2011 when the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand ruled in favour of DB breweries after a two- year court battle. The Society of Beer Advocates likens this trademark to being able to trademark the word 'Muesli' for cereal and is disappointed in this result as the word radler is commonly used in Europe. This ruling has also been labelled as 'out of touch with reality' and condemned by some intellectual property experts in New Zealand.

Life and career  Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Gussie and Harry Schwartz, a taxi driver. After a stint in the navy, Schwartz became interested in writing. He received his bachelor's degree from Colby College and a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University. He reported for The Binghamton Press from 1951 to 1955. During his professional writing career his work had been published by a variety of firms, including Lippincott, Bantam Books, Farrar Strauss, and Harper Collins. A series of his books on folklore for children were illustrated by Glen Rounds and each featured a type of folklore: the first, A Twister of Twists, a Tangler of Tongues, was published in 1972. Others in this series included Tomfoolery, which featured wordplay; Witcracks which was about smart-aleck riddles and jokes; and Cross Your Fingers, Spit in Your Hat, about superstitions. He is best known for the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series, which featured gruesome, nightmarish illustrations by Stephen Gammell. The series was America's most frequently challenged book (or book series) for library inclusion of 1990-1999.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 18, 1998. In the episode, Barbra Streisand obtains the Diamond of Pantheos from Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny, and transforms into a giant mechanical dinosaur called Mecha-Streisand. She is ultimately defeated by The Cure frontman Robert Smith, who himself transforms into a giant moth monster. The episode was written by series co- creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker. \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" parodies numerous popular Kaiju films and features portrayals of actor Sidney Poitier and film critic Leonard Maltin. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" was seen by 5.4 million viewers, a record high viewership for a South Park episode at the time. Streisand herself was critical of the series and her role in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\", although Leonard Maltin was complimentary about his portrayal. Plot During a field trip to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he promptly throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger. Streisand herself finds the boys at the bus stop and demands the \\"Triangle of Zinthar\\", and gets aggravated when they reject her. As they search for Streisand, Maltin tells Chef she is seeking the boys' triangle to complete a powerful and ancient relic, the \\"Diamond of Pantheos\\", which will allow her to become an evil and dangerous creature capable of conquering the world. He explains that the diamond was originally split into two pieces and hidden at different points of the world, but Streisand had managed to find the first of the two. Streisand later dons a disguise and visits the boys again, offering them a monetary reward for the triangle. Stan, Kenny and Kyle are suspicious, but Cartman insists they go along for the money. Streisand takes them to her condo in the mountains, where she ties the boys up and tortures them with her singing voice. Cartman relents and gives up the triangle. Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play tetherball and gets strangled by the rope. Actor Sidney Poitier arrives and turns into a giant fanged turtle to fight Mecha-Streisand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting a call from the boys and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature. During the ensuing battle, Smith-Moth manages to punch the Diamond of Pantheos away from Mecha-Streisand before flinging her into outer space, where she explodes and dies. The townspeople, including Jesus, joyfully praise Smith as a hero. As the singer walks off into the sunset, Kyle calls out \\"Disintegration is the best album ever!\\". The boys split the diamond again to try to prevent anyone else from getting its power and throw the pieces in the trash can. However, Kyle's little brother Ike finds the pieces of the diamond in the trash, resulting in the episode ending with the boys cowering in the presence of a new foe: Mecha-Ike. Production Robert Smith, who appeared in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\" as himself, was cast because South Park co-creator Trey Parker was a fan of his music. \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker. \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 18, 1998. Robert Smith, lead vocalist and guitarist for the English rock band The Cure, makes a guest appearance as himself, marking only the second time a celebrity guest played a major role in an episode, after Natasha Henstridge in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\". Following the success of \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes, allowing Parker and Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars. Parker, a fan of The Cure, said it was his lifelong dream to meet Smith, and he was one of the few celebrities Parker specifically requested to make an appearance. Smith performed all of his lines via telephone and Parker used the first reading of each line, even though they were executed in a very dead-pan voice. South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wrote \\"Mecha-Streisand\\". When Parker and Stone made fun of celebrities in previous South Park episodes, they were chosen at random and \\"all just in good fun\\". However, they chose to mock Barbra Streisand based on a strong distaste for the actress. They explained that after Colorado passed the Amendment 2, an amendment to the Colorado state constitution which forbids homosexuals from being recognized as a protected class (and would later be struck down by the Supreme Court in Romer v. Evans), Streisand made a public statement in which she called the Coloradans \\"a bunch of hicks\\", vowing never to visit Colorado again. Parker said he also finds her singing voice \\"annoying\\", which inspired the scene with Streisand torturing the boys by singing to them. They tried to make Streisand's portrayal as \\"sick and disgusting as possible\\" in the episode. Mary Kay Bergman, a voice artist who had done most of the female voices on South Park, portrayed Streisand in the episode. South Park animators created the episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation animation program most commonly known as \\"Alias\\". Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" was slightly more challenging to animate than other first-season episodes due to the laser beam-type effects featured in the final monster fight, which were specifically designed to resemble a low-budget monster movie with poor graphics. The scenes with an instructional guide taking the kids on a fossil hunt were based on real-life arrowhead-digging excursions Parker and Stone went on in Red Rocks Park during their childhood in Colorado. During a scene with Chef and Leonard Maltin driving in a car, actual video footage of Colorado roads is visible through the back window of the car. The footage was shot by a friend of Parker and Stone and used because the animators did not yet know how to create roads in perspective. Cultural references \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" parodies Kaiju films such as Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and Ultraman. Parker and Stone watched many Godzilla films during their childhoods, and Parker said he knew from the beginning of South Park that he would base an episode around the films. Streisand is based on Mechagodzilla, the mechanical doppelg√§nger of Godzilla. Smith is based on Mothra, the giant moth-like monster from the 1961 film Mothra and also one of Godzilla's rivals, which Parker described as his favorite of the Kaiju films. The scene in which six-inch-tall twins appear and ask actor Sidney Poitier to fight Mecha-Streisand are based on similar scenes and characters from the Mothra film. Poitier portrays a monster similar to Gamera, a flying turtle monster, and film critic Leonard Maltin transforms into a giant mechanical superhero resembling that of Japanese television superhero Ultraman. During the fights sequence, Stan shouts for Smith to \\"use robot punch\\", a line frequently used in Japanese robot television shows. The Diamond of Pantheos, on the other hand, closely resembles the pendant worn by a major character in the anime Galaxy Express 999. When the monsters battle each other at the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element throughout actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, \\"I really like Robert Smith\\", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, \\"Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra\\". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, \\"From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!\\", but Parker said Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, he screams in Japanese, \\"Listen, listen, here's a tulip\\", which Parker said is a phrase Japanese children say before passing gas. During the fight scene, a number of skyscrapers are shown getting destroyed. Parker, who acknowledged the buildings were never featured in any other South Park episode, said they were modeled after real-life skyscrapers in Denver and included in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\" only so they could get destroyed during the monster fight, a frequent element of battles in real Japanese monster films. Musical elements from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon Super Friends are also featured during the battle. Actress Sally Struthers, who was previously lampooned in the South Park episode \\"Starvin' Marvin\\", is briefly seen during a scene in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\", in which she is filming a movie scene with Poitier. Kyle tells Robert Smith, \\"Disintegration is the best album ever\\". The line was based on Parker's own enthusiasm for The Cure's 1989 album, Disintegration, and Robert Smith himself would go on to say in an interview that the line was his \\"happiest moment\\". As Smith walks into the sunset, a version of The Cure's \\"Let's Go to Bed\\" is played on the Japanese Lute (Biwa). Officer Barbrady makes a reference to singer-songwriter Fiona Apple with the line, \\"Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass.\\" Reception and release Barbra Streisand was highly critical of South Park and her portrayal in \\"Mecha-Streisand\\". In its original American broadcast on February 18, 1998, \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" received a 6.9 Nielsen rating, translating to 5.4 million viewers in 3.2 million households. At the time, it was a record high viewership for a South Park episode, breaking the record that was set earlier that month by \\"Damien\\", and was ten times the average of Comedy Central's non-South Park programming. Parker and Stone were very happy with the episode, but received feedback from fans that it was one of the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke. Streisand herself took a negative view of her portrayal, stating in a Mirabella interview, Parker and Stone created the second season episode \\"Spookyfish\\" in response, where they took a picture of Streisand's head, placed the image into all four corners of the screen and called it \\"Spooky vision\\". Leonard Maltin was complimentary about \\"Mecha-Streisand\\", and told Parker and Stone his children particularly enjoyed his portrayal in the episode. Regarding his appearance, Robert Smith had claimed that nothing in his career mattered as much to his younger nephews and nieces as the fact that he was featured on South Park. \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" was released, along with 11 other episodes, in a three-disc DVD set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes \\"Starvin' Marvin\\", \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" and \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\". \\"Mecha-Streisand\\", along with the other twelve episodes from the first season, was also included in the DVD release \\"South Park: The Complete First Season\\", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to \\"standards\\" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD separate from the DVDs. In 2008, Parker and Stone made \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" and all South Park episodes available to watch for free on the show's official website, \\"South Park Studios\\". The episode was revisited twelve years later in the show's 200th episode, along with many other past South Park storylines, featuring a redesigned Mecha-Streisand. During a duet with Neil Diamond, Mecha-Streisand lets out a green cloud from her groin that disgusts the people of South Park. The original Japanese theme song for the creature also plays in the episode. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \\"200\\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, as the animation quality of the series has improved over the years in general.

A scent hound 22‚Äì23 inches high at the withers, weighing anything between 55 and 65 pounds, it is a well constructed dog with a slow graceful gait. It has a large, strong head, a medium-length back and a pointed tail that tends to be long and sickle-shaped. Their ears are set at eye level; they have large prominent eyes and quite thick lips. Characteristics=Appearance= A well constructed dog, muscled and not too long, giving the impression of strength and energy. Head Artois puppy, three months old * Cranial Region: Its skull should be strong, broad, quite short, rounded and flat at its upper part but with the occipital protuberance only slightly pronounced. Its stop should be accentuated. *Facial Region: Its nose should be black, strong, with wide opened nostrils. Its muzzle should be straight and, seen in profile, moderately elongated. Of its lips, the upper lip should largely be covering the lower lip and must be rather important so as to give a square shape to the extremity of the muzzle, (as seen in profile). Its jaws/teeth should have a scissor bite, the upper incisors covering the lower in a narrow contact and are well set squarely in relation to the jaws. Its eyes, in relation to the width of the forehead, should not be very close together; they should be round, level with the head surface, with a melancholic and soft expression; they are dark brown in colour. The mucous membranes of the lower lids must not be visible. Its leathers should be set at eye level, a little thick, broad, round at the tip, almost flat and quite long, reaching the beginning of the nose. Its neck is moderately long, powerful; very little dewlap. Body Its back is broad and well supported. Its loins are slightly arched. The hips give a slight inclination to its croup, which is well muscled. Its chest is broad and long, rather let down so that the sternal line arrives at elbow level. Its ribs should be well sprung. Its belly flanks fully its body. Tail It is strong and quite long; there should be some longer and coarser, slightly offstanding hairs, (like ears of grain) towards the tip. It is carried in a sickle fashion, never falling forward. Limbs=Forequarters= A view of the ensemble indicates that its limbs are strong and vertical. Its shoulders are oblique and muscled. Its elbows are set well in the axis of the body. Its forearm should be lightly oblique. =Hindquarters= A view of the ensemble indicates that, (seen from behind), the point of the buttock, the middle of the leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot are on the same vertical line. Its upper thighs are let down and well muscled. Its hock joints are strong and moderately angulated, and the metatarsals are short and strong. =Feet= They are slightly elongated, strong but sufficiently tight; the pads are black, tough and compact. Coat and colour Its skin is quite thick. Its hair is short, thick and quite flat. The coat pattern is a dark fawn tri-colour, (similar to the coat of a hare or a badger), with a mantle or in large patches. The head is usually fawn, sometimes with a black overlay. Its main colours being tan and black and white in any combination. =Temperament= The Artois Hound is an energetic dog that is brave and loyal. Though it has a large amount of endurance, it is calm and well balanced. It is a moderate sized dog that will feature the best characteristics of the scenthounds. It has a powerful sense of smell, and it is fast and independent. These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent. Hunting The Artois Hound, (a Briquet, (of a small type)), is nowadays used especially in hunting with guns, and on horseback. It drives the game closer taking advantage of their faults with ingenuity; its speed is average but maintained. *In general countryside : Because of its acute sense of smell, it is capable of outmanoeuvring many of its prey's tactics. *In woodland areas : With its ancestral qualities of a hunter, in sparse and well scattered groups of tall trees, it can hunt a deer efficiently, and in the desired direction of its owner. *In the thicket : its intrepidity and bravery means that it can stir up and even the most obstinate boars. *Additional points: It is a robust animal with a high pitched call which can be heard from as far away as 2 km. Health problems There are no known health problems specific to the Artois Hound. Any health problems it may develop can be found in most other dog breeds. These dogs may have a maximum life expectancy of 13 years. Care=Exercise= This is a hunting dog that needs extensive amounts of exercise. Without it, the dog could become problematic for its owners. It should be taken on walks daily, and this dog is great for healthy people who love to jog and hike. While it can live in an apartment, it may perform better in a small yard. It is important for owners to make sure this dog is never unleashed in an unsecured area, as it may run off in the direction of the first interesting scent it picks up. It is important for owners to provide sufficient space for this breed to move around in. =Grooming= The Artois Hound does not require much grooming. The Artois' smooth short-haired coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although they should be bathed with mild soap only if or when necessary; they should also be dry shampooed occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard-bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect. The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections). History This breed, formerly named Picard, was much appreciated in hunting at the time of Henry IV of France and Louis XIII of France, and much sought after. Selincourt already made much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling a hare which had passed by one hour ago in dry weather. Le Couteulx de Canteleu, in Manuel de V√©nerie Fran√ßaise (1890), (Manual of French Hunting - 1890), praises also the Artois hound. He reports that the artesian breed of his time was crossbred and difficult to find pure but, despite that, it remained one of the best breeds for hare hunting. Northern France, bordering the English Channel, consists of the historical regions of Artois Hound. Hounds from this region stem from some of the earliest types. Engraving of the original D'Artois Hound. Note that it closely resembles version of today. The Artois Hound was a favorite by the 17th century. The Prince Alexandre de Gray wrote to the Prince de Galle, in 1609, of his intention to \\"send a pack of little d'Artois dogs to the king ...\\" In fact, this small French hound may have contributed to the formation of the Beagle in England. By the 19th century it became popular among French hunters to avail themselves of the dogs from the British Isles. With the importation of many British types, the inevitable crossbreeding resulted in the deterioration of the pure Artois Hounds. Crossing also took place with the taller, more elegant, longer, scroll-eared hounds called Normands (now extinct). During the 19th century, only the packs kept at Chantilly and those of the Prince de Conde retained the ancient type. In the 1880s, Ernest Levair and his cousin, M. Therouanne, began a 20-year effort to breed the original d'Artois, removing the last of the Normand blood. Their efforts resulted in great success. At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, M. Levoir in Picardy had attempted the re-establishment of the old Artois type without really succeeding. During that period and until the beginning of the First World War, it was another Picard breeder, Mr. Mallard, who dominated the raising of the breed. But if he produced very pretty dogs, as witnessed by his numerous awards in canine shows, they were not always in the type conformed with the description given by contemporary authors. For all their efforts however the Second World War was very damaging for the breed and after the Second World War, it was believed that the Artois was all but extinct. By the middle of the 20th century the breed had nearly disappeared, however in the 1970s a few aficionados, in particular Mr. Audrechy, (of Buigny les Gamaches in the Somme), decided to reconstitute the breed from a few remaining specimens which they located after along search. Thanks to their efforts the modern day Artois hound closely resembles the original. There are now about 500 dogs registered in their stud books, making a strong comeback since 1975. Notes Note that the Artois Hound does not yet have breed standards or classifications in any organisation, other than the FCI.

In Gascony, according to the families perpetuating the tradition of duck confit, all the pieces of duck are used to produce the meal. Each part can have a specific destination in traditional cooking, the neck being used for example in an invigorating soup, the garbure. Duck confit is considered one of the finest French dishes.  Traditional preparation  While it is made across France, it is seen as a specialty of Gascony. The confit is prepared in a centuries-old process of preservation that consists of salt curing a piece of meat (generally goose, duck, or pork) and then cooking it in its own fat. To prepare a confit, the meat is rubbed with salt, garlic, and sometimes herbs such as thyme, then covered and refrigerated for up to 36 hours. Salt-curing the meat acts as a preservative. Prior to cooking, the spices are rinsed from the meat, which is then patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the rendered fat, and placed in an oven at a low temperature (76 ‚Äì 135 degrees Celsius/170 ‚Äì 275 Fahrenheit).How to make duck confitDuck confit The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, generally four to ten hours. The meat and fat are then removed from the oven and left to cool. When cool, the meat can be transferred to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept in the refrigerator for up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit. Confit is also sold in cans, which can be kept for several years. The flavourful fat from the confit may also be used in many other ways, as a frying medium for saut√©ed vegetables (e.g., green beans and garlic, wild or cultivated mushrooms), savory toasts, scrambled eggs or omelettes, and as an addition to shortcrust pastry for tarts and quiches. A classic recipe is to fry or grill the legs in a bit of the fat until they are well-browned and crisp, and use more of the fat to roast some potatoes and garlic as an accompaniment. The potatoes roasted in duck fat to accompany the crisped-up confit is called pommes de terre √† la sarladaise. Another accompaniment is red cabbage slow-braised with apples and red wine. Use in other dishes Duck confit is also a traditional ingredient in many versions of cassoulet.

She holds the record for most nominations without a win with ten for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In 2019, she received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Eva Ayll√≥n will celebrate her 50th Anniversary in 2020. Biography Ayll√≥n adopted the stage name \\"Eva\\" from her maternal grandmother, Eva, who initiated her in vocalization at the age of three. As a child and teen, Eva Ayll√≥n sang in school competitions and later on television and radio. Throughout the early 1970s, Eva appeared in many m√∫sica criolla musical groups (locally called \\"pe√±as criollas\\") such as Rinconcito Monsefuano, La pe√±a de los Ugarte, Los Mundialistas o Callej√≥n and Los Kipus. Ayll√≥n sang as the lead voice in this popular trio from 1973 through 1975, eventually leaving the group to pursue a solo career. By 1979, she began touring internationally, with appearances in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan and since then her music and live performances are requested on a yearly basis at international music events. In 1989, Ayll√≥n was invited to join Los Hijos del Sol (Children of the Sun), a supergroup made up of Peruvian musical stars, developed by producer Ricardo Ghibellini in an effort to promote Peruvian music through performance and recording. Ayll√≥n released her first US album, Eva! Leyenda Peruana, on Times Square Records in 2004. Since then, Ayll√≥n's musical presence continues to expand boundaries. In her commitment to broaden the awareness of Afro-Peruvian culture, Ayll√≥n changed her residence from Lima, Peru to New Jersey that same year. Leyenda Peruana gained praise and recognition in different latitudes, and in Germany it received the Critic's choice award for Best Traditional Recording. The group is about to embark on another US and European tour to introduce new cities and new countries to Ayllon's music. In January 2007, Ayll√≥n was honored with a seat among the judges at Latin America's largest music festival, the Chilean \\"Festival De Vi√±a del Mar\\". In April, Ayll√≥n released a live concert DVD recording titled Live from Hollywood. Ayll√≥n has produced over 30 records, and nominated ten times to the Latin Grammy. Her latest release \\"Eva Ayllon Celebra 40 A√±os Cantandole Al Peru\\", is a compilation of her greatest hits, and revisits the musical styles that she has performed over the last four decades. In 2008 she performed at a sold out Carnegie Hall on November 8 in New York. Ayll√≥n performs in the film Sebastian Ayll√≥n continues to tour and lives in Lima.

(\\"Island cities\\" refers to the City of Houston's practice of annexing around the existing boundaries of incorporated municipalities.) Other \\"island cities\\" include the Memorial VillagesBunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, Hilshire Village, Hunters Creek Village, Piney Point Village, and Spring Valley Village. The outlying areas of Houston, as well as the rest of Bellaire, the Memorial Villages, the airports and the city's suburbs and enclaves are outside the loop. Another ring road, Beltway 8 (also known simply as the \\"Beltway\\"), encircles the city another 5 miles (8 km) further out. A third, State Highway 99 or Grand Parkway, has begun construction roughly 10 miles (16 km) beyond the Beltway around the outer suburbs and currently extends from north of Interstate 10/U.S. Highway 90 east of Katy to Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 in Sugar Land. Locations within the Houston city limits inside Beltway 8 had traditionally used the 713 area code. Those outside Beltway 8 but within city limits had received the 281 or 832 area code. The geographic division between 713, 281, and 832 has been eliminated, and newly issued phone numbers (especially for cell phones and fax machines) within that zone may be assigned any of the three codes. There is also a new, 346 area code. Areas far north, west, east and south of the inner-city also use 936 and 409. Zip codes in Houston range from 77002 to 77099. A small portion of northeast Houston uses zip codes 77339 and 77345. Houston is the most populated city in the United States without zoning laws. City voters rejected creation of separate commercial and residential land-use districts in 1948, 1962 and 1993. As a result, Houston has grown in an unusual manner. Rather than a single ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù as the center of the city's employment, five additional business districts have grown throughout the inner-city, including one for Houston's medical center complex. If these business districts were combined, they would form the third largest downtown in the United States. The city also has one of the largest skylines in the United States but because it is spread over a few miles, pictures of the city show, for the most part, the main downtown area. Development of geographic areas John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press said that before the interstate system was established in Houston, the neighborhoods were \\"strongly distinct neighborhoods and districts with poetic names[...]\\".Lomax, John Nova. \\"Houston 101: Sig Byrd, Houston's King of True-Life Noir.\\" Houston Press. Friday November 20, 2009. Retrieved on September 4, 2012. Beginning in the 1960s the development of the 610 Loop caused the focus of the Houston area to move away from Downtown Houston. Joel Barna of Cite 42 said that this caused Greater Houston to shift from \\"a fragmenting but still centrally focused spatial entity into something more like a doughnut,\\" and that Downtown Houston began to become a \\"hole\\" in the \\"doughnut.\\" As interchange connections with the 610 Loop opened, according to Barna Downtown \\"became just another node in a multi-node grid\\" and, as of 1998, \\"has been that, with already established high densities and land prices.\\"Barna, Joel Warren. \\"Filling the Doughnut.\\" Cite 42.

Downtown Houston Downtown Houston at night Downtown is located in the very center of the city's highway system, bounded by I-45 on the south and west, I-69/US-59 on the east, and Buffalo Bayou on the north. The Skyline District is the heart of downtown and home to headquarters of various multinational businesses and financial institutions. The Houston Theater District, in north downtown, is home to Houston's eight performing arts organizations and includes the Alley Theatre, Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, Wortham Center, the Revention Music Center, and Jones Hall, home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. The theater district is the second-largest performing arts district, next to New York City. Downtown is also home to one of the city's two Chinatowns. The first Chinatown is situated in the shadow of the George R. Brown Convention Center downtown, while the newer, larger Chinatown (originating around 1982), is located primarily on Bellaire Boulevard west of the Sharpstown neighborhood. The Main Street Corridor in downtown, opened in 2004, has become a popular nightlife spot, particularly now that the city has light rail service. This is because the light rail line begins at the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown. Preston Station is a neighborhood in downtown Houston that takes its name from the Houston MetroRail's Preston Station, which is at the neighborhood's center. It is well known for its bars and restaurants, and includes such famous buildings as the Rice Hotel, the St. Germain building, and the Hotel Icon. South Side South of downtown, but to the east of Meyerland and Fondren, lies Hiram Clarke, Sunnyside, South Park, Kennedy Heights, and other largely African-American communities with sizable Latino populations. Collectively (with the Third Ward) known as the \\"Southside\\", these formerly rural communities were childhood homes of country singer Kenny Rogers and (more recently) rap artist Scarface. Hiram Clarke is a small neighborhood in south side Houston. The neighborhood is adjacent to Hiram Clarke Blvd. and West Fuqua Street. It was named after a former president of Houston Lighting & Power, a predecessor to Reliant Energy. Southwest The term \\"southwest Houston\\" often refers to the area that opened in the years following World War II, when they were considered to be suburbs, such as Alief, Fondren Southwest, Meyerland, Sharpstown and Westbury. Alief is a large, ethnically diverse community which Houston began annexing in 1977. Fondren Southwest and Meyerland are centers of Houston's Jewish community. Sharpstown has large Hispanic and Asian American communities and was the first master-planned community in Houston. Also in the southwest is the Pakistani & Indian enclave, now known as the Mahatma Gandhi District, informally known as Hilcroft. Westbury and Meyerland are becoming popular places for some gay men and lesbians to live, as real estate in the Neartown area has become more expensive as it has gentrified. Southeast See Southeast Houston Northside The Northside of Houston consists of several Historic neighborhoods to include Houston Heights, Near Northside, The Fifth Ward, The Historic Sixth Ward, Kashmere Gardens, Trinity Gardens, Homestead, Acres Homes, Greater inwood ,the East Aldine District and Greenspoint. Residents of these neighborhoods commonly refer to this area as \\" Northside \\" Many suburban Houstonians confuse the term to be also associated with the suburbs of North Houston such as Klein, Texas, Spring, FM 1960 or The Woodlands. The Northside along with other neighborhoods inside 610 have recently become the focus of Gentrification in an effort to tear down historic homes to make room for modern living to accommodate the influx of young professionals drawn to the Downtown/Inner 610 Loop area. The Houston Light Rail is extending its route that will head north from the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown (UHD) along North Main St and Fulton St. The Northside consists primarily of Hispanic and African Americans with the exception of The Houston Heights neighborhood which has a large Caucasian presence. Notable residents of the Northside include Politician Barbara Jordan, Singer Kenny Rogers, Activist Mickey Leland, Rapper Slim Thug and Boxer George Foreman. Energy Corridor The Energy Corridor is a district that lies along Memorial Drive and Eldridge Parkway in west Houston. The district is loosely bound by the area just north of IH-10 (the Katy Freeway) and Westheimer to the south, and extends from Kirkwood Road to the east and Fry Road to the West. The area is defined by many oil industry related companies, residential neighborhoods, restaurants and parks. Midtown Midtown, located immediately south of downtown, is a recently redeveloped area with many newly constructed apartments and condominiums. The area is also home to Little Saigon, the center of the city's Vietnamese American commerce and businesses. Midtown is roughly bounded by I-45 on the north, SH-288 on the east, I-69/US-59 on the south, and Bagby Street on the west. Midtown is an official State of Texas Cultural Arts and Entertainment District, as of 2012. Uptown Uptown Uptown is Houston's second-largest business district and home to the world-famous Williams Tower. The Williams Tower is said to be the tallest building outside of a CBD. The District is home to Houston's tallest condominium towers. Uptown has headquarter and subsidiary locations of Fortune 500 companies, high-end retailers, and local and international fashion designers. Actual residents do not use the term Uptown. That is reserved for city officials and/or realtors. Texas Medical Center Texas Medical Center The Texas Medical Center, about three miles (5 km) south of the Midtown area is the largest medical complex in the world.Facts & Figures  Houston, Texas. Texas Medical Center. Retrieved on September 6, 2013. Bordering the Texas Medical Center are Reliant Park to the south and the Rice University/Rice Village area to the west. Museum District The Museum District comprises more than 20 institutions, Hermann Park, the Houston Zoo and the Miller Outdoor Theatre. It is one of the most visited museum districts in the country. The Museum District covers a radius around Mecom Fountain in Hermann Park. The Six \\"Wards\\" When Houston was established in 1837, the city's founders divided it into political geographic districts called \\"wards.\\" The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts. Much of the predominantly African American First Ward was demolished and renovated as part of a gentrification effort. Much of the district is bordered by Houston Avenue, Interstates 10 and 45, and Washington Avenue. Because of rising land values, houses formerly located in Third Ward, Neartown, the West End and West University Place were relocated from their former land parcels and rehabilitated. Allen's Landing park at Buffalo Bayou and White Oak in the First Ward. The Second Ward, located east of downtown, was developed in the early 20th century. The Second Ward is predominantly a Hispanic community. The area has been undergoing gentrification due to its close proximity to downtown and entertainment venues. In the mid-to-late 2000s upper middle class residents moved into this East End area to take advantage of houses that are less expensive than west side houses. Second Ward is located in the East End district and is one of Houston's oldest neighborhoods. The predominantly African American Third Ward, southeast of downtown, was home to one of the most affluent African American communities in the South after World War I. It is also where Texas Southern University and University of Houston are located. The Third Ward lies within two city council districts (D and I). The Fourth Ward, known as Freedmen's Town for the freed slaves that settled there after the United States Civil War, was the first and most prominent African American community in Houston. It is home to the first campus of Booker T. Washington High School which was later moved to Independence Heights in northern Houston. Historically, the ward has been among the poorest areas of the inner-city, but is undergoing extensive gentrification because of its proximity to downtown. The ward included the Allen Parkway Village housing project, which was redeveloped into the Historic Oaks at Allen Parkway Village. The Freedmen's Town Historical District was created in 1988. Today, about 40 percent of the original wood- frame homes remain in the ward. The Fifth Ward is another predominantly African American community originally settled by freed slaves. It too is undergoing gentrification. A section of the Fifth Ward, Frenchtown, once held the center of the Creole community in Houston . The Sixth Ward is bounded by Memorial Drive to the south, Glenwood Cemetery to the west, Washington Avenue to the north, and Houston Avenue to the east. It was carved out of the Fourth Ward in 1877 as a residential area. There are many examples of Greek revival, Victorian, and Classical Revival architecture in the neighborhood, but due to extensive gentrification many are being demolished in favor of modern housing. Greenway Plaza Skyline of Greenway Plaza. The Greenway Plaza business district is west of Midtown and southwest of Downtown Houston. The district is home to Lakewood Church, the country's largest megachurch. Neartown Neartown is an area located in west-central Houston, Texas and is one of the city's major cultural areas. The location has a distinctive character of eccentricity and a diverse population. The eastern‚Äìsoutheastern portion of Neartown (colloquially referred to as Montrose) is the center of Houston's gay and lesbian community, and known for its vintage shops, 1950s-style eateries and street art. The Neartown area traditionally hosted the Westheimer Street Festival, a colorful community gathering that was ended mostly due to gentrification. It is also the location of the Menil Collection and the University of Saint Thomas. Other notable communities The historic Houston Heights, near downtown, has the highest point of elevation in the city. Like the smaller Woodland Heights neighborhood just to its east, it was originally a separate, independent suburb connected to Houston by streetcar. It was incorporated in 1891 and consolidated into the city of Houston in 1919. Even today it retains a ban on liquor sales and is a popular area for antique shopping. Like the neighboring Neartown, Houston Heights has long been a popular place for the artistic and gay and lesbian communities to live. Like other neighborhoods, the Heights has been experiencing gentrification pressures as the inner-loop grows, but residents concerned with historic preservation have resisted through the use of deed restrictions. Many of the Heights' Victorian houses and Craftsman bungalows are in high demand, especially those that have been remodeled. The Houston Heights is also home to the ArtCar Museum, a tourist attraction. River Oaks is the city's most affluent area, often compared to Beverly Hills. Beyond Houston, it is the wealthiest neighborhood in the entire state and is home to many celebrities and political figures. Situated as it is between downtown and Uptown, River Oaks is a collection of mansions in a sea of high-rise apartments and lofts. Near and partially blending into River Oaks, the areas of Highland Village and Upper Kirby are home to many high-end shopping and dining venues. Kingwood section of Houston. To the west is the Memorial Area. The zip code for Memorial (77024) is the sixth wealthiest in Texas. It contains the largest of a series of affluent municipalities separate from but surrounded by the city of Houston, known as the Villages, which include Hedwig Village, Bunker Hill Village, Hunters Creek Village, Piney Point Village, Hilshire Village, and Spring Valley Village. Clear Lake City is a master-planned community located in southeast Houston. It is home to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, the University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake and a very large upper-middle class Asian American community. The area was annexed into the city of Houston in 1979. League City, just south of this area, is home to a few water-side resorts. To the northeast is the master-planned community of Kingwood, which was annexed by the city of Houston in 1996. Kingwood is the largest master-planned community in Harris County. Adjacent cities and suburbs In addition to the \\"island cities\\" of Bellaire, West University Place, Southside Place and the Memorial Villages, there are several communities not part of Houston that are important to the metropolitan area. =Harris County= Pasadena is Houston's most populous suburb and the former location of \\"Gilley's\\", the honky-tonk bar that inspired the hit 1980 movie Urban Cowboy, which was filmed in Pasadena. Because of its location skirting the ship channel where most of the city's refineries are located, Pasadena is considered the backbone of Houston's enormous petrochemical complex. The nearby cities of Baytown, La Porte, which is home to the San Jacinto Monument, and Channelview are also host to many refineries and chemical plants. Other nearby cities are Deer Park, Galena Park, and South Houston. Katy is about 30 minutes west of downtown. Manylive between Katy and Houstonthose areas have \\"Katy\\" addresses and are referred to as the \\"Katy Area\\", while the city proper is known as \\"Old Katy\\". Because of this, the \\"Greater Katy\\" area has a population of over 250,000. Several developments are located in this area, including Cinco Ranch, Kelliwood, and various other communities. Much of the Katy area borders the western portion of George Bush Park, and it is home to Katy Mills Mall. The Katy area also stretches into northern Fort Bend County as well as southeast Waller County. Cypress is an unincorporated area about 30 minutes northwest of downtown. Originally a grouping of rice farms and forest, this area has seen tremendous growth since the 1980s, almost all of it single-family housing. Cypress is also home of Cy-Fair ISD, metro Houston's second-largest school district. Other cities to the northwest are Jersey Village, a bedroom community at the intersection of Beltway 8 and the Northwest Freeway, and Tomball, a city of around 25,000 at the edge of Harris County. Between Cypress and Katy lies Bridgeland, a large development in the early stages of construction. At completion, the developers expect a population of 65,000 in the area. Humble, Texas is a town northeast of Downtown, adjacent to Bush Intercontinental Airport. Humble area has a sizable population, which includes Atascocita. While the city of Humble itself has a high crime rate, the area is one of the fastest and safest areas in Houston. =Fort Bend County= Sugar Land is a city southwest of Houston in northeast Fort Bend County, and is named for the former Imperial Sugar refinery. It is home to a number of international energy, software and product firms. It also is one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest cities in the state due to the numerous master-planned communities in the area, such as First Colony, New Territory, Greatwood, Sugar Creek, Sugar Lakes, Avalon, and Riverstone. Sugar Land has the most master-planned communities within Fort Bend County, which is home to the largest number of master-planned communities in the nation. Sugar Land ranked as the hottest place to live within the state of Texas and was third in the United States for 2006 according to Money magazine, with the city receiving honors for its quality government services, affordable housing, and diversity (around one- quarter of Sugar Land's residents are Asian-American). Stafford lies between Sugar Land and Houston, straddling Fort Bend and Harris counties. Stafford is home to many corporate campuses due to the lack of a municipal property tax. The Stafford Municipal School District, run by the city, is the only school district in Texas run by a municipal government. In 1890, the land that now comprises Missouri City was advertised for sale in St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas as \\"a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer.\\" Despite all the efforts to appeal to settlers from the \\"north\\", the first actual settlers came from Arlington, Texas ‚Äì between Dallas and Fort Worth ‚Äì in early 1894. Partially within Harris County, but mostly in neighboring Fort Bend County, the city boasts a large African American population. \\"Mo City\\", as it is sometimes called, has experienced significant \\"white flight\\". Most of this white flight has occurred in the northeastern portions of the city which are now predominantly black, and master-planned communities within the city such as Quail Valley and Lake Olympia boast significant white populations, and some of these communities have pockets of African-American and Asian-American residents. Sienna Plantation, an unincorporated community within Missouri City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, is culturally one with Missouri City. =Brazoria County= Pearland is a city located south of Houston in Brazoria County with a small portion in Harris County. Pearland is the fastest-growing city in Brazoria County ‚Äì it has increased from about 19,000 to 39,000 residents in the 1990s alone (based on 2000 U.S. Census figures). It has since increased from 39,000 to 82,000 since 2000. It is home to companies such as Weatherford and Aggreko. It is the closest suburb to Downtown Houston and the Texas Medical Center (about away), which attracts professionals from the oil, gas, energy, medical and aerospace industries. Some of the master-planned communities found in the area are Silverlake, Silvercreek, and Shadow Creek Ranch. =Montgomery County= The Woodlands is a large master-planned community about north of Downtown Houston in Montgomery County. It is one of the largest and most popular master-planned communities in the country. Most of The Woodlands lies in the city of Houston's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) and the city limits of Shenandoah. Negotiations are under way with Houston and Conroe to the north to release The Woodlands from these ETJs and some in the community want The Woodlands to become a full city itself. =Galveston County= A popular day trip may include Galveston to visit Moody Gardens or the sandy beach. Before near destruction in 1900 Galveston was larger and wealthier than Houston, dubbed \\"The Wall Street of the Southwest\\" and on par with New Orleans as the Gulf Coast's premier city. Galveston is also home to the new Schlitterbahn Waterpark. The waterpark is located across the street from Moody Gardens. Galveston's vulnerability on a narrow barrier bar island led to the creation of the Port of Houston, made by dredging the shallow Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay to form a protected port some 40 miles (64 km) inland of the open Gulf and less than 10 miles (16 km) from Houston's central business district. Beach houses owned by Houstonians have sprung up in other cities along the Gulf of Mexico's shoreline. Another tourist hot spot is Kemah where visitors see the Kemah Boardwalk, which has many seafood restaurants and local tourist attractions. Kemah is surrounded by Galveston Bay to the east and Clear Lake Shores (a brackish-water boater's paradise with open pass through to Galveston Bay) to the west. Five other cities lay along Interstate 45 on mainland Galveston County. League City, is the largest city in the county surpassing Galveston between 2000 and 2005, and the northernmost city in the county, with parts of it extending into Harris County. Dickinson, La Marque, Friendswood, and Texas City make up the other remaining cities in the county.

She was formerly a CBS News correspondent, and was their principal \\"Ground Zero\\" reporter during the morning of the September 11 attacks. In 2007 she joined MSNBC as an occasional anchor, and was subsequently chosen as co-host of Morning Joe, alongside Joe Scarborough. She and Scarborough were married on November 24, 2018, with Rep. Elijah Cummings serving as the officiant. Mika Brzezinski is a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Her main political interest is in wage equality for women. She is also the author of three books; two on her career as a journalist and one on food addiction. Brzezinski is the daughter of diplomat and political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as adviser to both Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter. Early life Brzezinski was born in New York City, the daughter of Polish- born foreign policy expert and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and Swiss-born sculptor Emilie Anna Bene≈°ov√°. Her mother, of Czech descent, is a grandniece of Czechoslovakia's former president Edvard Bene≈°. Her father was teaching at Columbia University when she was born; the family moved to McLean, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in late 1976, when Zbigniew was named National Security Advisor by newly elected President Jimmy Carter. Her brother, Mark Brzezinski, is an American diplomat and was the United States Ambassador to Sweden from 2011 to 2015. Her second brother is military expert Ian Brzezinski. She is a first cousin of the author Matthew Brzezinski. Brzezinski attended the Madeira School and then enrolled at Georgetown University. During her junior year, she transferred to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1989. Career Brzezinski at the Miami Book Fair International 2013 Brzezinski began her career in journalism as an assistant at ABC's World News This Morning in 1990. A year later, she moved to Tribune-owned Fox affiliate WTIC-TV/WTIC-DT in Hartford, Connecticut. There, she progressed from assignment and features editor to general assignments reporter. In 1992, she joined CBS affiliate WFSB-TV/WFSB-DT in Hartford and quickly progressed through the ranks to become its weekday morning anchor in 1995. In 1997, she left that role to join CBS News, where she served as a correspondent and as anchor for the overnight Up to the Minute news program. In 2001, Brzezinski began a short hiatus from CBS News, during which she worked for rival MSNBC on the weekday afternoon show, HomePage, with co-anchors Gina Gaston and Ashleigh Banfield. Entertainment Weekly described the trio as \\"the Powerpuff Girls of journalism\\". =9/11 correspondent= She returned to CBS News as a desk correspondent in September 2001, a move that thrust her into the limelight as a principal \\"Ground Zero\\" reporter for the September 11, 2001, attacks. Brzezinski was broadcasting live from the scene when the South Tower collapsed. In her last position at CBS News, Brzezinski served as a CBS News correspondent, substitute anchor, and segment anchor for breaking news segments and routine updates. During this period she became an occasional contributor to CBS Sunday Morning and \\"60 Minutes.\\" She was subsequently fired by CBS. =MSNBC= Brzezinski returned to MSNBC on January 26, 2007, doing the evening \\"Up to the Minute\\" news updates. Then she worked primetime newsbreaks during the week. She also filed occasional reports for NBC Nightly News and appeared as an occasional anchor on Weekend Today. Brzezinski resigned from both shows on the eve of a renewal option, said Brzezinski, when Scarborough selected her to co-host on Morning Joe. Brzezinski said, \\"I struggled to keep up with the live interaction broadcasting format at 6-9 am. I became more comfortable when I found myself having a primary function of reading the prompt for lead-ins and breaks. Mika, the 'hot anchor' was born. The producers slowly encouraged my participation in news reader segments that I was more at ease with. Geist and Joe slowly found me a capable news reader and the expansion of my role was a process. I was not pleased with the reference to being the 'hot anchor'.\\" Since the program's inception, Brzezinski appeared as co-host and news reader on MSNBC's morning program Morning Joe, alongside Joe Scarborough and Willie Geist. =Campaign against trivial journalism= On June 26, 2007, near the beginning of Morning Joe, Brzezinski refused to read a report about Paris Hilton's release from jail. One hour later during another news break segment, her producer Andy Jones again pushed the story as the lead, ranking it over Indiana's Republican Senator Richard Lugar's break with President Bush on the Iraq War, which Brzezinski considered more important. After several sarcastic remarks from host Scarborough, she attempted to set the story's script on fire on the air, but was physically prevented from doing so by co-host Geist. She then tore up the script, and one hour later, got up and ran another copy of the script through a paper shredder retrieved from Dan Abrams's office.Video of the MSNBC incident (dubbed by MSNBC \\"the journalistic shot heard round the world\\") The incident was quickly popularized on the Internet, and in the days that followed, Brzezinski received large quantities of fan mail supporting her on- air protest as a commentary on the tension between \\"hard news\\" and \\"entertainment news\\".\\"Paris Hilton script screwed up, burnt and shredded\\", The Telegraph\\"Newscaster's on-air Paris protest\\", BBC News Similarly, on July 7, 2010, she objected on-air to pressure to report on Lindsay Lohan and Levi Johnston. Eventually, Geist and Pat Buchanan reported the stories with the caption, then popularized, \\"News You Can't Use\\". Erik Wemple of The Washington Post criticized Brzezinski and co-host Scarborough for frequent phone interviews with Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaign, even though much of Morning Joe's coverage was critical of Trump's campaign. =Democratic National Committee email leak= The 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, had emailed Chuck Todd, the Political Director of NBC News and host of Meet the Press, to demand that he \\"stop\\" Brzezinski from criticizing the DNC's treatment of Bernie Sanders. In December 2016, after Clinton had lost, Brzezinski suggested the Clinton campaign had tried to silence her by calling executives at NBC and telling them she \\"needed to be pulled off the air\\". =Refusal of Kellyanne Conway interviews= On February 15, 2017, Brzezinski banned Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway from future appearances on her show. Brzezinski said, \\"We know for a fact that [Conway] tries to book herself on this show. I won't do it. Because I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect\\".\\"'Morning Joe' bans Trump aide Kellyanne Conway: She's not credible anymore\\", New York Daily News, February 15, 2017, retrieved February 19, 2017. Her co-host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from future appearances was based on her being \\"out of the loop\\" and \\"in none of the key meetings\\". \\"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance\\". On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin agreed that Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \\"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\\", Rubin wrote.\\"Can we start ignoring whatever Conway and Spicer say?\\" by Jennifer Rubin, The Washington Post, February 15, 2017, retrieved February 21, 2017. According to both Scarborough and Brzezinski, Conway is privately \\"disgusted\\" by her job and Donald Trump, and her words do not reflect her actual beliefs‚Äîthough Conway disputed the claim. =Trump tweets= Brzezinski being interviewed at BookExpo America in 2018 During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted several times criticizing both Brzezinski and Scarborough.Borchers, Callum. \\"Trump was right about the romance between Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. But also wrong\\", The Washington Post (May 4, 2017). In March 2017, Brzezinski called Trump's presidency \\"fake and failed\\", and soon thereafter Trump unfollowed Brzezinski and Scarborough on Twitter.Jagannathan, Meers. \\"President Trump unfollows 'Morning Joe' co-hosts on Twitter\\", New York Daily News (March 13, 2017). In late June 2017, Brzezinski was again the target of Trump's tweets in which he called her \\"low I.Q. Crazy Mika\\" and asserted that she was \\"bleeding badly from a face-lift\\". Brzezinski and Scarborough then accused the White House of threatening to blackmail them with an expos√© in a tabloid magazine unless the pair apologized publicly to the President. On May 20, 2020, while hosting Morning Joe, Brzezinski spoke out against Trump for tweeting a conspiracy theory that her husband Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of Lori Klausutis, an intern in Brzezinski's husband, Joe Scarborough's Florida office in 2001, while he was in Congress. Trump labelled Klausutis' death a \\"cold case\\" in his tweet. Klausutis was found dead at her desk in July 2001. An autopsy revealed an undiagnosed heart problem that caused her to lose consciousness and hit her head when she fell. During a live segment on Morning Joe, Brzezinski stated \\"Donald, you're a sick person. You're a sick person, to put this [Klausutis'] family through this, to put her husband through this, to do this just because you're mad at Joe, because Joe got you again today. Because he speaks the truth, and he speaks plainly about your lack of interest and empathy in others and your lack of ability to handle this massive human catastrophe (COVID-19), the fact that you have made it worse and you make it worse every day. And that you won't even wear a mask to protect people from your germs\\". Brzezinski later announced in a tweet that she would be contacting Twitter about Trump's tweet, which she said violated their policies, and urged the platform to stop allowing their policies \\"to be abused by the day\\", citing Trump's tweet as libel, and further announced a call with the company was being arranged. On May 26, 2020, The New York Times published an op-ed, containing a letter in which the husband of Lori Klausutis, Timothy Klausutis demanded Trump to stop exploiting his late wife and urged Twitter to take down the tweets. Klausutis wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking him to intervene and claimed Trump has violated Twitter's terms of service and \\"has taken something that does not belong to him-the memory of my dead wife-and perverted it for perceived political gain\\". Later, the same day, Trump posted two tweets seemingly addressing the letter, writing: \\"The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe & his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking .... about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? [...]\\". =Comment about Pompeo= On December 12, 2018, Brzezinski called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \\"a wannabe dictator's butt-boy\\", referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during a live MSNBC broadcast. She apologized later that day (as well as the next day) after her remarks were widely criticized as homophobic. Personal life On October 23, 1993, Brzezinski married TV news reporter James Patrick Hoffer, now of WABC-TV. They met when both worked at WTIC-TV. They have two daughters, Emilie and Carlie Hoffer. Hoffer and Brzezinski divorced in 2016 amidst allegations of an affair between Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. In early 2017, Brzezinski became engaged to her co-host Joe Scarborough, and they were married on November 24, 2018 in Washington, D.C. Bibliography Brzezinski has written three books, all of which were published by Weinstein Books. Her first book, All Things at Once, was a memoir published in January 2010. Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You're Worth, published in 2011, discusses women and financial negotiations. It includes tips for negotiating salaries and compensation packages. In 2018 this was revised, updated, and was released as Know Your Value. Her third book, Obsessed: America's Food Addiction and My Own, was published in 2012.

As the administrative division known as Haa Alif it includes Ihavandhippolhu, the northernmost natural atoll of the Maldive archipelago, as well as a section of the larger Thiladhunmathi or Tiladummati Atoll. Thiladhunmathi was divided into its northern and southern divisions on May 21, 1958. The north division was integrated with Ihavandhippolhu forming administratively a new atoll called Haa Alif atoll or Thiladhumathi North. In total Haa Alif atoll contains 42 islands, 14 of which are inhabited.At present there are three Tourist resorts in the atoll. North Thiladhunmath is third largest atoll in the Maldives in terms of population and land area. The atoll being at the north tip of the Maldives is the closest to Sri Lanka and India. Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll contains 42 islands, 16 of which are inhabited. NOTE: Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).Tim Godfrey, Atlas of the Maldives, Atoll Editions 2004 History In Matheerah there is a famous shrine (ziyaraiy, mausoleum) which was visited formerly by the Maldive kings and their families in order to seek blessings. Such tomb visits are aspects of Sufism that existed among the Maldivians until very recent times. Hence this island was referred to with the honorific title Matheerahffulhu (High (noble) Island) by the Sufi Muslims of the Maldives at that time. Traditionally the northernmost atoll of the Maldives was Minicoy (Maliku). Fishermen from Thuraakunu and from Minicoy often crossed the Maliku Kandu on their boats to visit each other's islands. Marriage alliances were common. Now Minicoy is a part of India and communication is highly restricted. References * Divehi TƒÅrƒ´khah Au Alikameh.

A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, an owner publicly recording his or her own interests (which in some types of property must be on a court-recognised Register) protects himself or herself from losing those to an indirect buyer, such as a qualifying buyer from a thief, who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, so- called \\"race-notice\\" jurisdictions require the BFP himself or herself to record (depending on the type of property by public notice or applying for registration) to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance. In England and Wales and in other jurisdictions following the 20th century oft-repeated precedent, the BFP will not be bound by equitable interests of which he/she does not have actual, constructive, or imputed notice, as long as he/she has made \\"such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made\\".Kingsnorth Finance Trust Co Ltd v Tizard [1986] 1 WLR 783 BFPs are also sometimes referred to as \\"equity's darling\\". However, jurist Hackney explains the portrayal is inaccurate; in cases where legal title is passed to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, it is not so much that equity has any great affection for the purchaser ‚Äì it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property. The relationship between the courts of equity and the BFP is at root characterised as, geared toward the BFP, with benign neglect of the old owner(s). However, equity allows a proven BFP to claim for a full legal conveyance from former legal owner, failing which the court itself will convey title. In the United States, the patent law codifies the bona fide purchaser rule, . Unlike the common law, the statute cuts off both equitable and legal claims to the title.Filmtec Corp. v.

E. Studwell and M. Baldin, The big band reader: songs favored by swing era orchestras and other popular ensembles (Haworth Press, 2000), p. 35. It was used as the basis for a very successful and highly regarded 1938 recording by Ella Fitzgerald, composed by Fitzgerald in conjunction with Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander). It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 13188. Traditional lyrics The rhyme was first noted in the United States in 1879 as a children's rhyming game. It was sung while children danced in a circle. One of the number ran on the outside of the circle and dropped a handkerchief. The nearest child would then pick it up and chase the dropper. If caught, the dropper either was kissed, joined the circle, or had to tell the name of their sweetheart. An early noted version had the lyrics: :A-tisket a-tasket :A green and yellow basket :I wrote a letter to my love :And on the way I dropped it, :I dropped it, I dropped it, :And on the way I dropped it. :A little boy he picked it up :And put it in his pocket. In some variants, the second line is \\"I lost my yellow basket\\". In other variants, the last line is \\"A little girl picked it up and put it in her pocket\\". In nineteenth-century England, the rhyme used in the same game had somewhat different but evidently related words: :I lost my supper, last night, :And the night before, :And if I do this night, :I never will no more. :I sent a letter to my love, :I carried water in my glove, :And by the way I dropped it, I did so, I did so: :I had a little dog that said bow-wow! :I had a little cat that said meow-meow! :Shan't bite you, shan't bite you, :Shall bite you. :I dropt it, I dropt it, :And by the way I lost it.Northall, G. F. English Folk-Rhymes: A collection of traditional verses relating to places and persons, customs, superstitions, etc. 1892. pg. 364 Lyrics by Ella Fitzgerald Ella Fitzgerald, in conjunction with Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander), extended and embellished the rhyme into a jazz piece that was her breakthrough hit with the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1938. It has since become a jazz standard. The lyrics changed the color of the basket to brown and yellow. In Ella's version a little girl picks up the note and then takes the basket after it is carelessly left on the ground. A follow-up song written by Fitzgerald and Webb entitled \\"I Found My Yellow Basket\\" (1938) was less successful.

Lines from the song have been mentioned by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Half Man Half Biscuit, Ganksta N-I-P, Shangri-Las, Scarface, Eminem, Madonna, and Boondox. Nabisco did a take-off of the song for its ad campaign in the 70's, with the lyrics \\"A Trisquit, A Trisquit, Baked only by Nabisco.\\" =In movies= Curly Howard recites a paraphrase of the (non-musical) rhyme in The Three Stooges short We Want Our Mummy (1939). The music for the song was used in the opening scene of John Ford's 1940 film The Grapes of Wrath to help establish the contemporary time frame of the events of the film. Ella Fitzgerald performed the song in the Abbott and Costello film, Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942). A rendition of the song was also performed in the Paul Thomas Anderson movie The Master (2012).

Under the doctrine, the grantor of a deed (generally the seller of a piece of real property) is estopped (barred) from denying the truth of the deed.

The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre- filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS). Metal clay artists looking for more strength in their silver creations can also mix PMC fine silver clay with an equal part of PMC Sterling clay.960: An alloy of sterling PMC url=http://celiefagojewelry.blogspot.com/2014/02/960-new-alloy-of-sterling- pmc.html The firing of this alloy is found to be up to for two hours. Another available alloy, EZ960 Sterling Silver Metal Clay was invented by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay‚Ñ¢ and COPPRclay‚Ñ¢. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at for 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10‚Äì11%. =Precious Metal Clay (PMC)= PMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by metallurgist Masaki Morikawa.Introduction to Precious Metal Clay by Mary Ann Devos (C)2003 published by Wardell Publications Inc As a solid-phase sintered product of a precious metal powder used to form a precious metal article, the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold and a water- soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver. The PMC brand includes the following products: * The original formula of PMC, now called \\"standard\\": fired at for 2 hours, shrinks by 30% during firing. * PMC+ & PMCflex: fired at for 10 minutes or for 30 minutes; shrinks 15%, due to a particle size reduction. PMC+ is also available in sheet form which can be worked like paper; for example, for origami. * PMC3: fired at for 45 minutes or for 10 minutes; shrinks by 10%. It can also be fired using a butane torch by heating it to orange heat for at least 2 minutes. It has a longer working life than the older formulations. It is also available in slip and paste forms which can be painted onto the surface of an object to be used as a mold. * Aura 22: a 22-carat gilding material, a gold paste intended to be painted onto the surface of silver PMC pieces, or ready-made silver objects.McCreight, Tim. \\"What's New?\\" Metalsmith Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, p42-45, 4p * PMC Pro: a harder product which is only 0.900 fineness silver, hence it cannot be hallmarked as sterling silver. It also requires kiln firing in a tub of activated carbon for 1 hour at . * PMC Sterling: is fired at and shrinks by 10‚Äì20%. Because of the copper content in this formula, firing is a two-step process; step one is an open-shelf firing and step two requires a firing pan with activated carbon media. =Art Clay Silver (ACS)= ACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8‚Äì10%. Further developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at , allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain. In 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22-carat gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays. Base metal clays Lump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its silver counterpart. Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of the metal by atmospheric oxygen. A means to accomplish this ‚Äì- to place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container ‚Äì was developed by Bill Struve. Powders Metal clays are also available as dry powders to which water is added to hydrate and kneaded to attain a clay consistency. One advantage to the powders is their unlimited shelf life. The first silver clay in powder form was released in 2006 as Silver Smiths' Metal Clay Powder.MCPsilver999  url=http://www.metalclaypowder.com  In the following years base metal clays by Hadar Jacobson and Goldie World released several variation containing copper, brass, and even steel.

Early life Poggioli was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she attended the Buckingham School (now Buckingham Browne & Nichols). She graduated from Harvard College in 1968. She did post-graduate work at the University of Rome as a Fulbright Scholar. The selection of Rome was no coincidence, as she is the daughter of Italian anti-fascists who in the 1930s were forced to flee Italy under Mussolini. Her father, Renato Poggioli, was the author of The Theory of the Avant-Garde and one of the founders of the anti-fascist Mazzini Society. Career In 1971, Poggioli began working for Ansa, the Italian news service, at their English desk. She made her debut on NPR on September 4, 1982. She continued serving both Ansa and NPR for four years before leaving Ansa in 1986. Poggioli eventually rose to European correspondent for NPR. Her radio career was interrupted in 1990 when she spent a year as a research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Poggioli was in London, gathering European reaction, during the 1991 Gulf War. Later, she was lauded for her coverage of the war among the Bosnians, Serbs, and Croats. For her coverage, she won the George Foster Peabody Award in 1993. In 2005 Poggioli was the featured reporter for the funeral of Pope John Paul II and subsequent conclave. Poggioli has become a favorite reporter of the Magliozzi Brothers on Car Talk, possibly on account of their common Italian ancestry. Her name has also been featured in the absurdist comic strip Zippy the Pinhead. In 2000, Poggioli received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Brandeis University. In 2006, she received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Personal life Poggioli resides in Rome, Italy.

This type of prosthesis is referred to as a removable partial denture because patients can remove and reinsert it when required without professional help. Conversely, a \\"fixed\\" prosthesis can and should be removed only by a dental professional. Partially edentulous conditions The patient's oral condition is categorized based on the remaining dentition in a classification first proposed by Dr. Edward Kennedy in 1925. His classification consisted of four general outlines for partially edentulous arches that can present within a patient, which then could be treated with an RPD. When there is an edentulous space that is outside of the four classifications, it is termed a modification space. The use of this classification allows for easier communication between dental professionals, allows for easily visualization of the arch, and distinguishes a tooth-borne or tissue-supported RPD. *Class I (bilateral free ended partially edentulous) *Class II (unilateral free ended partially edentulous) *Class III (unilateral bounded partially edentulous) *Class IV (bilateral bounded anterior partially edentulous) Kennedy Class I RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on both sides (left and right) in a single arch (either mandibular or maxillary), and there are no teeth posterior to the edentulous area. In other words, Class I RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, while replacing the missing posterior teeth on both sides with false denture teeth. The denture teeth are composed of either plastic or porcelain. Class II RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on one side (left or right) in a single arch, and there are no teeth behind the edentulous area. Thus, Class II RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, as well as on teeth that are more towards the back of the mouth of the side on which teeth are not missing, while replacing the missing more-back-of-the- mouth teeth on one side with false denture teeth. Class III RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some teeth in such a way that the edentulous area has teeth remaining both posterior and anterior to it. Unlike Class I and Class II RPDs which are both tooth-and-tissue-borne (meaning they both clasp onto teeth, as well as rest on the posterior edentulous area for support), Class III RPDs are strictly tooth-borne, which means they only clasp onto teeth and do not need to rest on the tissue for added support. This makes Class III RPDs exceedingly more secure as per the three rules of removable prostheses that will be mentioned later, namely: support, stability and retention. (See the article on dentures for a more thorough review of these three fundamentals of removable prosthodontics.) However, if the edentulous area described in the previous paragraph crosses the anterior midline (that is, at least both central incisors are missing), the RPD is classified as a Class IV RPD. By definition, a Kennedy Class IV RPD design will possess only one edentulous area. Class I, II and III RPDs that have multiple edentulous areas in which replacement teeth are being placed are further classified with modification states that were defined by Oliver C. Applegate.Oliver C. Applegate. 1949. Essentials of partial denture prosthesis. Kennedy classification is governed by the most posterior edentulous area that is being restored. Thus if, for example, a maxillary arch is missing teeth #1, 3, 7-10 and 16, the RPD would be Kennedy Class III mod 1. It would not be Class I, because missing third molars are generally not restored in an RPD (although if they were, the classification would indeed be Class I), and it would not be Class IV, because modification spaces are not allowed for Kennedy Class IV.Davis Henderson; Victor L. Steffel. 1973. McCracken's Removable partial prosthodontics. 4th Ed. The results of a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, showed that the occurrence of Kennedy Class III partial edentulism was 67.2% in the maxillary arch and 64.1% in the mandibular arch. Followed by Class II in both maxillary and mandibular arch with an average of 16.3% in maxillary arch and 14.8% in the mandibular arch. Based on these results, class III has the highest prevalence in younger group of patient (31‚Äì 40 years). Class I and class II have the highest incidence among older group of Patients (41‚Äì50 years).  Designing partial dentures  Prior to designing partial dentures a complete examination is undertaken to assess the condition of remaining teeth. This may involve radiographs, sensibility testing or other assessments. From this examination and assessment of occlusion (occlusal plane, drifting, tilting of teeth and surveyed articulated casts) the designing of partial dentures can begin. Information from previous dentures can be very useful in deciding which features to keep the same and which features of the design to change ‚Äì in the hope of making an improvement. = Stages of partial denture design = A systematic design process should be followed: ¬∑ the teeth to be replaced must be decided. ¬∑ the soft tissue to be replaced (flange) is then drawn. ¬∑ the major connector is selected from a list of options (the options available will depend on the above assessment). ¬∑ retentive features of the denture must be decided ‚Äì these may include clasps, guide planes and indirect retention (often important in dentures involving Kennedy Class 1 and Class 2 saddles). ¬∑ supportive features are then decided ‚Äì these prevent the denture sinking into the soft tissue; often the natural teeth can take some of the loading (rest seats and connector coverage). However, this is not always possible. Support may thus be tooth-borne, mucosal borne or a combination of tooth and mucosal borne. ¬∑ the denture should where possible have features that withstand horizontal movement (bracing) and the clasps should have appropriate reciprocation. ¬∑ the denture base material (usually acrylic or cobalt-chromium) and materials of the various components must be selected. ¬∑ the hygiene of the prosthesis must be appropriate trying where possible to minimise the soft tissues coverage. The design should be reviewed and simplified removing unnecessary components. Once the partial denture has been designed, the shade and mould of the replacement teeth can be selected. Within the design process (and prior to the master impression stage of denture construction), modifications may be suggested to teeth. This may be undertaken to create occlusal space for rest seats or to create undercuts for the placement of clasps (such as addition of composite resin) or to create guide planes for easier insertion and removal of the denture.  Components of an RPD  Removable partial denture made from flexible nylon resin Acrylic denture plate Rather than lying entirely on the edentulous ridge like complete dentures, removable partial dentures possess clasps of cobalt-chrome or titanium metal or plastic that \\"clip\\" onto the remaining teeth, making the RPD more stable and retentive. The parts of an RPD can be listed as follows (and are exemplified by the picture above): *Major connector (The thick metal \\"U\\" in the RPD image above is a lingual bar, a type of major connector) **Anterior-posterior palatal strap **Single palatal strap **U-shaped palatal connector (Horseshoe) **Lingual bar **Lingual plate Upper connectors There are many options for major connectors for removable upper partial dentures. The type of connector used will vary depending on the specific circumstances and the results of a comprehensive examination and discussion with the patient. Commonly used major connectors are outlined in the table below along with details of factors affecting the choice of using them. Plate Advantages of plates are that they are useful when several teeth are missing or there are multiple saddle. They also provide more retention, stability and support due to larger palatal coverage. Plates are useful when there are long distal extensions. U shaped or 'horse shoe denture Palatal bar Disadvantages of plates are that they overs a lot of patients mouth so sometimes not well tolerated and also may affect phonetics. Plates can be problematic if there is a torus palatinus. Palatal bar (Strap/ Anterior-Posterior) Advantages of these are their rigidity and minimal soft tissue coverage yet still having good resistance to deformation. A-P strap useful for Kennedy class I and II or if there is a torus. A-P strap gives greater distribution of stresses. Disadvantages of these are that there is not much support due to less palatal coverage and also that is it bulky and so disliked by some patients. U-shaped palatal bar (horseshoe connector) Advantages of these are that they are useful in cases where we do not want to cover much of the palate e.g. if patient has a strong gag reflex, a large palatal torus or Kennedy class III. Disadvantages of these are that they are flexible due to distal extensions which can have adverse effects on force transmission to abutment teeth. They can traumatic to the residual ridge. Spoon denture Advantages of these are that they are useful in small anterior saddles and are cheap to make. Disadvantages of these are that they have large palatal coverage for a small saddle. Palatal Strap/Bar (Single/ Anterior, mid or Posterior) Advantages of these are that single strap is useful for Kennedy class III and IV cases. Spoon denture Disadvantage of these are that single strap requires careful placement if there is a torus palatinus. They are generally inappropriate for Kennedy Class 1 or 2. = Type of connectors for lower teeth = A major connector is the part of a partial denture that links components on one side of the arch with those on the other. It must be strong and rigid enough to provide a suitable skeleton to the prosthesis and located so as not to damage the gingival or movable tissues. Five types of major connectors are listed below:  Lingual bar  A lingual bar has a pear-shaped cross section tapering towards the gingival boundary. It should be positioned high enough so as to not irritate the lower movable tissue but low enough to allow for a substantial quantity of material to be used to ensure stiffness. At least 7mm of space is usually required. It sits on the soft tissue posteriorly to the dentition. Along with the lingual plate it is the most commonly used type of connector in the lower arch. A lingual bar is more hygienic than a lingual plate but is difficult to add to if teeth are later extracted and require to be added to the denture. Lingual bar example (Photo: University of Dundee Dental School integrated teaching laboratory)  Sublingual bar  Sublingual bar- A sublingual bar is similar to a lingual bar but is located on the floor of the mouth posteriorly and inferiorly to its usual location. They are used when the superior border of a lingual bar would be positioned too closely to the gingival border. They are contraindicated in patients with a high lingual frenum and in situations where they may interfere with tongue movements. Sublingual bar example Lingual Plate A lingual plate is a thin plate contoured to the lingual surfaces of the lower anterior teeth. A lingual plate is useful when there is insufficient space for a lingual bar which would result in irritation of the gingival boundary. If the teeth are spaced out and the patient does not wish for visible metal to be seen then an interrupted lingual plate may be used where the material is cut away where it would be visible anteriorly. A disadvantage of a lingual plate is that it covers a lot of gingival margins and is less hygienic than a lingual bar. It should be used with caution in those patients with a high https://dentistinpleasanthill.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of- removable-partial-dentures/ caries rate]. A major advantage is that is easier to add teeth to a denture with a lingual plate than a lingual bar connector. In addition, it is useful in providing some additional support for mobile lower anterior teeth. Lingual plate  Buccal bar  In rare cases where the inclination of the remaining anterior teeth is problematic and the use of a lingual connector inappropriate, a buccal bar can be considered. Buccal bar example: Note the lingual tilting of the teeth meaning a buccal bar is required for a suitable path of insertion/removal.  Continuous clasp  Continuous Clasp- A continuous clasp is sometimes used in addition to a lingual bar and rarely as a sole major connector. It involves a bar of material placed along the cingulum of the anterior dentition. The continuous clasp has the added advantage of providing indirect retention when used in addition to a lingual bar. It may be used when a lingual plate is compromising aesthetics. Continuous Clasp in combination with a lingual bar \\\\----[AP1]The picture shows 2 teeth being replaced so best to alter wording *Minor connector (See the small struts protruding from the lingual bar at roughly 90 degree angles.) *Direct retainer (Examples are in the upper left of upper photo and lower right of lower photo; the clasp arms act to hug the teeth and keep the RPD in place. The metal clasp and rest immediately adjacent to the denture teeth is also a direct retainer.) *Indirect retainer (An example is the little metal piece coming off the \\"U\\" at a 90 degree angle near the top of the upper photo, which is a cingulum rest on a canine.) **Physical retainer (This is a mesh of metal that allows the pink base material to connect to the metal framework of the RPD. Some consider physical retainers their own component (making a total of seven), while others consider them within the indirect retainer category (thus making a total of six components.) *Base (the pink material, mimicking gingiva) *Teeth (plastic or porcelain formed in the shape of teeth) Clasp design Direct retainers may come in various designs: * Cast circumferential clasp (suprabulge) ** Akers' ** Half and half ** Back- action ** Ring clasp * Wrought wire clasp * Roach clasp (infrabulge) ** I-bar ** T-bar ** Y-bar ** 7-bar Both cast circumferential and wrought wire clasps are supra bulge clasps, in that they engage an undercut on the tooth by originating coronal to the height of contour, while Roach clasps are infrabulge clasps and engage undercuts by approaching from the gingival. In addition there are a couple of specific theories which include the clasp design: *RPI: mesial rest, distolingual guide plate, I-bar **The RPI design was made for clasping a bilateral free end extension. These clasps are unique because they have to take into account extra torque force due to being tissue borne (and not tooth borne) at the posterior. **Described by Kratochvil in 1963 and modified by Krol in 1973 ***Kratochvil designed the abutment tooth with a long rest (from the mesial marginal ridge to the distal pit), long guide plane, and a regular I-bar clasp. ***Krol modified this design with a short occlusal rest, short guide plane (touching only from occlusal to middle third), and a mesial-shifted I-bar. The theory behind Krol's decision was to allow for movement of the partial denture without placing too much torque on the abutment tooth. **An illustration of the RPI design function *RPA: mesial rest, distolingual guide plate, Akers' clasp-style retentive arm *RPC: mesial rest, distolingual guide plate, other type of cast circumferential clasp **So named in response to the RPI Philosophy introduced by Kratochvil and Kroll  Indirect retention  Indirect retention is required to prevent displacement of saddles, such as free-end saddles or anterior saddle which is curved outside a straight line between the abutment teeth. Such indirect retention can only be achieved where both claps and rests work together to form lever system (Class III lever system) to retain the free part of denture.

Early work He was born in New York City, but mostly worked in Britain from the 1950s onwards. In 1951, Binder directed two short films in the obscure Meet Mister Baby series; these films were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2015. He did his first film title design for Stanley Donen's Indiscreet (1958).McGregor, Don Sighting Down the Gun Barrel at 007 Starlog Sep 1983 The Bond producers first approached him after being impressed by his title designs for the Donen comedy film The Grass Is Greener (1960). Binder also provided sequences for Donen for Charade (1963) and Arabesque (1966), both accompanying music by Henry Mancini. James Bond Binder created the signature gun barrel sequence for the opening titles of the first Bond film, Dr. No (1962). Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, his assistant Trevor Bond created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear. Binder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before he died in 1991: At least one critic has also observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of The Great Train Robbery (1903). Binder is also known for featuring women performing a variety of activities such as dancing, jumping on a trampoline, or shooting weapons in his work. Both sequences are trademarks and staples of the James Bond films. Maurice Binder was succeeded by Daniel Kleinman as the title designer for GoldenEye (1995). Prior to GoldenEye, the only James Bond movies for which he did not create the opening title credits were From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964), both of which were designed by Robert Brownjohn. Other sequences Binder shot opening and closing sequences involving a mouse (an animal that didn't appear in either the novel or the film) for The Mouse That Roared (1959), a sequence of monks filmed as a mosaic explaining the history of the Golden Bell in The Long Ships (1963), and a sequence of Spanish dancers explaining why the then topical reference of nuclear weapons vanishing in a B-52 mishap shifted from Spain to Greece in The Day the Fish Came Out (1967). He designed the title sequence for Sodom and Gomorrah (1963) that featured an orgy (the only one in the film). He took three days to direct the sequence that was originally supposed to take one day. Binder also was a producer of The Passage (1979), and a visual consultant on Dracula (1979) and Oxford Blues (1984). Death Binder died from lung cancer in London, aged 72.

The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of conveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to the payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is then transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the contract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will nevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land unless the seller in possession or deemed in possession has failed to protect it. Such issues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who will bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction, but is the general rule. Effect of death of a party If one of the parties dies after the contract for sale of the property has been executed, the doctrine will govern how that party's interest will pass to his heirs. For example, the seller wills his real property to his son, and his personal property to his daughter. If the seller dies after a contract for conveyance is signed by a buyer, the seller's interest in the land will be treated as personal property, and the proceeds of the sale will pass to his daughter. In most jurisdictions, the real property interest created by the contract will pass to the buyer's heirs, while the seller's personal property interest created by the contract will pass to the seller's estate. The State of New York does not recognize equitable conversion. In New York, as long as the buyer is without fault, the risk of loss remains on the seller until the buyer takes title or possession. Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act A growing minority of States have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (UVPRA) in one form or another.Rabin, Edward et al. Fundamentals of Property Law. Foundation Press: New York, 2006. pp. 1128‚Äì1129. The UVPRA bases the legal consequences of no-fault casualty loss on the right of possession of the property at the time the loss occurs. See Brush Grocery Kart v. Sure Fine Market, 47 P. 3d 680 (Colo. 2002). Generally, the provisions of the UVPRA can be modified or avoided in the Land Sale Contract. The \\"Massachusetts Rule\\" In Massachusetts and a handful of other states, the seller continues to bear the risk until the title is actually transferred to the buyer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.

The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 and today is considered to be one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S. Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th- century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. National Park Service. The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200 years old. In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters. History=18th century= The property was originally part of the Northampton land grant given to Col. Henry Darnall (c. 1645-1711), a relative of Lord Baltimore, in 1695. His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col. Charles Ridgely (1702-72), a tobacco farmer and trader. The bill of sale records that the property included \\"... houses, tobacco houses (tobacco barns), stables, gardens, and orchards.\\" Charles Carnan Ridgely, Hampton's second master By the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than and included an ironworks. His son, Capt. Charles Ridgely (1733-90), expanded the family business considerably to include gristmills, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the American Revolutionary War, the ironworks was a significant source of income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the Continental Army. In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by Castle Howard in England, owned by relatives of his mother. When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States. When Capt. Ridgely died that same year, his nephew, Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760-1829), became the second master of Hampton. He had of irrigation pipes laid in 1799 from a nearby spring to provide water to the Mansion and the surrounding gardens, which he was extensively developing. Prominent artisans of the time were hired to design geometric formal gardens, which were planted on the Mansion's grounds between 1799 and 1801. An avid horseman, Charles Carnan also began raising Thoroughbred horses at Hampton, where he had a racetrack installed. A 1799 advertisement promoted the stud services of his racehorse, Grey Medley. Another of Ridgely's racehorses, Post Boy, won the Washington City Jockey Club cup.McKee, pp. 18‚Äì19. =19th century= Under Charles Carnan Ridgely, Hampton reached its peak of in the 1820s. The mansion overlooked a grand estate of orchards, ironworks, coal mining, marble quarries, mills, and mercantile interests. The vast farm produced corn, beef cattle, dairy products, hogs, and horses. More than 300 slaves worked the fields and served the household, making Hampton one of Maryland's largest slaveholding estates. Six parterres were designed on three terraced levels facing the mansion, planted with roses, peonies, and seasonal flowers. In 1820, an orangery was built on the grounds.Thomas Sully. Lady with a Harp: Eliza Ridgely. 1818. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Thomas Sully's painting Lady with a Harp, a portrait of Eliza Ridgely (1818), was in the Great Hall of Hampton Mansion from the 1820s to 1945, when it was sold to the National Gallery of Art. A replica is now displayed at the Hampton Mansion. Charles Carnan Ridgely frequently entertained prominent guests in the Mansion's 51 ft. x 21 ft. (16 m by 6.4 m) Great Hall, such as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Revolutionary War general, the Marquis de Lafayette. Charles Carnan served as governor of Maryland between 1816-19\\\\. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will. The Hampton estate was split among various heirs, with his son, John Carnan Ridgely inheriting the mansion and . The ironworks closed and thereafter the Ridgelys' income was primarily derived from farming, investments, and their stone quarries. John Carnan added plumbing, heating, and gas lighting to the mansion. Eliza Ridgely John's wife and the subject of Thomas Sully's famous portrait, Lady with a Harp, purchased many artworks and furnishings for the mansion. She was a noted horticulturist and had successively larger and more elaborate gardens cultivated on the grounds, with a large variety of flowers and shrubs grown in the estate's greenhouses and tended by some of the 60 slaves purchased by John Carnan Ridgely.McKee, p. 67. By the mid-19th century, the Hampton estate had one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S., along with various exotic trees and plants gathered by Eliza Ridgely during her frequent travels to Europe and the Orient. In the warm months, the potted citrus plants were brought outside and arranged around the terraced gardens, then taken into the heated orangery during the winter. She had one section of the garden planted with colorful red, yellow, pink, and maroon coleus from Asia. In 1859, Hampton's fame for lavish style was such that the author of a book on landscaping wrote, \\"It has been truly said of Hampton that it expresses more grandeur than any other place in America\\". Hampton Mansion in 1861 Terraced gardens in 1872 In January 1861, shortly after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, Charles Ridgely (the son of John Carnan and Eliza Ridgely) formed the pro-Confederate Baltimore County Horse Guards at Hampton with himself as captain of the militia unit that he described as \\"states' rights gentlemen.\\" One of his militia's cavalry men, Lieut. John Merryman, was subsequently arrested by the Union Army and imprisoned in May 1861 on a charge of treason, sparking the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Ex parte Merryman. As the Civil War raged across the farmlands of Maryland and Pennsylvania at the Battle of Antietam (1862) and the Battle of Gettysburg (1863), the Ridgelys' Hampton estate remained untouched. Although Maryland, as a border state, was exempted from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the Maryland General Assembly eliminated slavery in 1864. With the end of slavery, Hampton began to decline. A number of the former slaves continued to work at Hampton as paid household servants but the Ridgelys had to hire other hands to work the farm. With the deaths of John and Eliza in 1867, their son Charles became the next master of Hampton. The mansion and the remaining were subsequently inherited upon Charles' death in 1872 by Captain John Ridgely Prominent guests, including Theodore Roosevelt, continued to visit Hampton and enjoy its grounds. =20th century= As nearby Baltimore grew and local agriculture declined, the Ridgelys found it increasingly difficult to maintain the property. Five of the six parterres were removed and replanted as a grass lawn. Some income was generated by producing cider from the estate's apple orchards and operating a dairy. In 1929, Capt. John Ridgely and his son, John Ridgely Jr., formed the Hampton Development Corporation and sold some of the remaining of land. In 1938, John Ridgely, Jr. (1882-1959) became the sixth generation of the family to become master of Hampton. His company sold off large portions of the estate to a suburban housing development in the 1930s and 1940s, now known as the fashionable Hampton residential community.McKee, p. 63. The Farm House, where John Ridgely Jr. moved in 1948 The Hampton Mansion remained in the Ridgely family until 1948, when John Ridgely Jr. moved to the smaller Farm House on the property and the Mansion was acquired by the Avalon Foundation (now part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation).McKee, pp. 62 and 105. The seventh and last generation of Ridgelys to live at the mansion was his son, John Ridgely III , who, after marrying Lillian Ketchum in the mid-1930s, continued to reside at the mansion with his wife until they both entered Army service during World War II.McKee, pp. 90‚Äì92. The Hampton Mansion and remaining of the Ridgely estate were designated a National Historic Site by the Secretary of the Interior on June 22, 1948--the first site to be so selected on the basis of its historical significance and \\"outstanding merit as an architectural monument\\".McKee, pp. 7 and 105. Hampton Mansion was opened to the public in May 1949 under the care of Preservation Maryland for the next thirty years (1949‚Äì79). Work also began in 1949 to restore four of the site's six 19th-century parterres. On October 15, 1966, Hampton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In October 1979, it was acquired by the National Park Service (NPS), which has operated and managed the estate since.McKee, p. 105. The NPS subsequently acquired additional acreage containing original Ridgely structures, bringing the park to its present size. In 1998, the NPS stated its purpose for the historic site: =21st century= Mansion bedroom with original furnishings As part of the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS in 1998 for the estate's long-term planning and operation, the NPS began studying the mansion's security, safety, electrical systems, and environmental issues in 2000. Critical needs were identified, such as the lack of a fire suppression system and climate control. Conservators of the property's furnishings and paintings said that the need to stabilize temperature and humidity levels inside the mansion was \\"urgent due to unacceptable environmental stress\\". The NPS finalized plans in 2004, including an environmental impact assessment, for installation of a modern HVAC system and a concealed fire sprinkler system to protect the historic mansion and its irreplaceable contents from loss by fire. Starting in January 2005, the mansion closed for almost three years as it underwent the major restoration project. As part of the 2005‚Äì07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830‚Äì60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007. The Park Service's chief ranger for the Hampton National Historic Site said afterwards of the $3 million in renovations, \\"I don't think the mansion has ever looked better\\". \\"Preservation Maryland\\", a statewide preservation advocacy organization, conferred its Stewardship Award in 2007 on the Hampton National Historic Site for refurnishing the mansion's rooms with historical accuracy while unobtrusively installing the fire suppression and climate control systems. National Park Service management right The remaining estate, straddling Hampton Lane, is now managed by the National Park Service and open to the public, with ample free parking, a gift shop, and wheelchair accessibility at the mansion. Visitors are provided a guided tour of the mansion, where the original furnishings owned by the Ridgelys may be seen, along with the family's collection of oil paintings, silverware, and ceramics comprising some 7,000 objects. In addition to the mansion itself, visitors may view nine surviving original structures on the grounds built during the 18th to mid-19th century period:McKee, p. 93. :* Farm House ‚Äì located north of the mansion and next to the slave quarters, a portion is believed to predate the Ridgelys' purchase of the property in 1745. The Ridgely family lived here while the mansion was being constructed in the 1780s. Thereafter, it was the residence of the farm manager or overseer.McKee, p. 98. After John Ridgely Jr. and his wife Jane vacated the mansion in 1948, they lived here until their deaths.McKee, p. 10. :* Slave quarters ‚Äì two preserved stone buildings adjacent to the Farm House, now provided with interpretive exhibits on slave life at Hampton. Displayed is a newspaper advertisement by Charles Carnan Ridgely offering a reward for the return of a runaway slave, as well as a Christmas gift list kept from 1841 to 1854 by the daughter of John Carnan and Eliza for the slaves' children.McKee, p. 68. :* Dairy ‚Äì built of stone before 1800 :* Mule barn ‚Äì built of stone c. 1845 :* Long house/granary :* Ash house, wooden log building, and dovecote The Farm House (left) and slave quarters (right) in 2007 Self-guided tours may be made of the grounds during hours when the park is open to the public, including the farm, formal garden, family cemetery, and two stables built of stone for the Ridgely family's thoroughbred horses. A replica of the original orangery (built in 1824) may also be viewed (the original wooden orangery, which burned down in 1926, was reconstructed on the original foundations in 1976).McKee, p. 120. One surviving deep underground icehouse is visible near the mansion and is open to visitors.McKee, p. 118. Among the surviving trees planted by the Ridgelys in the 1820s are a large tulip tree, a European Beech, and Catalpas. A prize Cedar of Lebanon, brought back from the Middle East as a seedling by Eliza Ridgely, is one of the largest in the U.S. Numerous special events are scheduled throughout the year, such as chamber music concerts and harpsichord performances presented in the mansion's ornate Great Hall, milking demonstrations at the dairy by costumed milkmaids, carriage rides, hay harvesting by scythe, corn harvesting, blacksmithing demonstrations, and jousting reenactments. The Baltimore Sun reported that Hampton had 35,000 visitors in 2008. The local community actively supports the site's preservation through a non-profit friends' group, \\"Historic Hampton,\\" which has assisted the National Park Service in achieving historical accuracy and interpretive potential of the interiors, along with presentation of various activities. In May 2008, a $195,000 challenge grant was announced by the National Park Service, matched by an equal amount to be raised by Historic Hampton, for further restoration of the mansion's interiors. The National Park Service also maintains an on-site archive of Ridgely family papers from 1750-1990 for researchers. The Tea Room controversy Mansion front facade detail When the Hampton estate first opened to the public in 1949, the mansion's kitchen was converted into a small restaurant. Known as the Tea Room, it was operated by a concessionaire for the next 50 years, serving lunches featuring Hampton Imperial Crab (backfin lump meat from the blue crab, baked and seasoned with spices) and other Chesapeake Bay seafood delicacies, served with a glass of sherry. A local newspaper columnist described the Tea Room as \\"offering gentility ... a fireplace nearly as big as a wall and mullioned windows with sills that are nearly thick. The view is rolling lawns ...\\" When the Tea Room was closed by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, officials said they did so because of the potential fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it \\"may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal ... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations,\\" the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were \\"disappointed\\" by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee‚Äîwhich raises money for various projects at Hampton‚Äîalso criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that \\"The mansion is not going to be the site of any food operation,\\" but has made no further comment since then.

Presumably composed early in Bach's career, it is one of his most important and well- known works, and an important influence on 19th and 20th century passacaglias:Silbiger, Grove. Robert Schumann described the variations of the passacaglia as \\"intertwined so ingeniously that one can never cease to be amazed.\\"Hans Theodore David, Arthur Mendel, Christoph Wolff. The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents, 503. W. W. Norton, 1998. History The autograph manuscript of BWV 582 is currently considered lost; the work, as is typical for pieces by Bach and his contemporaries, is known only through a number of copies. There is some evidence that the original was notated in organ tablature.Williams, 182. It is not known precisely when Bach composed the work, but the available sources point to the period between 1706 and 1713. It is possible that BWV 582 was composed in Arnstadt soon after Bach's return from L√ºbeckWolff, 94. (where he may have studied Buxtehude's ostinato works). The first half of the passacaglia's ostinato, which also serves as the fugue's main subject, was most probably taken from a short work by the French composer Andr√© Raison, Christe: Trio en passacaille from Messe du deuxieme ton of the Premier livre d'orgue.Williams, 183.Butler, Grove. It is possible that the second half of the ostinato was also taken from Raison, the bass line of Christe: Trio en chaconne of Messe du sixieme ton of the same publication is very similar. See Example 1 for Bach's and Raison's themes. However, some scholars dispute Raison's influence. Bach's work shares some features with north German ostinato works, most notably Buxtehude's two chaconnes (BuxWV 159 and 160) and a passacaglia (BuxWV 161), and there is clear influence of Pachelbel's chaconnes in several variations and the overall structure.Williams, 184‚Äì5. Analysis=Passacaglia= The passacaglia is in time, which is typical of the form. Bach's ostinato comprises eight bars, which is unusual but not unheard of: an ostinato of the same length is used, for example, in Johann Krieger's organ passacaglia. The opening of the piece, which consists of the ostinato stated in the pedal with no accompaniment from the manuals, is slightly more unusual, although this idea also occurs elsewhere, and may even have been used by Buxtehude.Williams, 184. There are 20 variations in BWV 582/1. The first begins with a typical C minor affekt, \\"a painful longing\\" according to Spitta, similar to the beginning of Buxtehude's Chaconne in C minor, BuxWV 159.Williams, 185; includes the Spitta quotation and reference. Numerous attempts have been made to figure out an overarching symmetrical structure of the work, but scholars have yet to agree on a single interpretation.Kobayashe, 62. Particularly important attempts were made by Christoph Wolff and .Kobayashe, 62‚Äì3. Some scholars have speculated that there is a symbolic component to the structure of the work: for instance, Martin Radulescu argues that BWV 582/1 is \\"in the form of a cross\\".Martin Radulescu. On the form of Johann Sebastian Bach's Passacaglia in c minor, The Organ Yearbook 1980: 95‚Äì103. There is agreement among most scholars that the Passacaglia builds up until its climax in variation twelve. This is followed by three quiet variations, forming a short intermezzo, and then the remaining five variations end the work. Bach performer and scholar Marie-Claire Alain suggested that the 21 variations are broken down into 7 groups of 3 similar variations, each opening with a quotation from a Lutheran chorale, treated similarly to the Orgel-B√ºchlein written at a similar time:Alain, 1993. * Bars 8‚Äì12, the top part spells out the opening notes of \\"Nun komm' der Heiden Heiland\\" * Bars 24‚Äì48, a cantilena spells out \\"Von Gott will ich nicht lassen\\" * Bars 49‚Äì72, the scales are a reference to \\"Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar\\" * Bars 72‚Äì96, recalling the \\"star\\" motif from \\"Herr Christ, der Ein'ge Gottes- Sohn\\" * Bars 96‚Äì120, ornamented figure similar to that in \\"Christ lag in Todesbanden\\" accompanies theme in the soprano then moving successively to alto and bass * Bars 144‚Äì168 \\"Ascending intervals in bass recall the Easter chorale \\"Erstanden ist der heil'ge Christ\\". Alain also points out that the numbers (21 repetitions of the Passacaglia ground and 12 statements of the fugue subjects) are inversions. =Fugue= The passacaglia is followed, without break, by a double fugue. The first half of the passacaglia ostinato is used as the first subject; a transformed version of the second half is used as the second subject.Wolff, 97. Both are heard simultaneously in the beginning of the fugue. A countersubject enters immediately afterwards and is then used throughout the piece. When the three subjects appear simultaneously, they never do so in the same combination of voices twice; this therefore is a permutation fugue, possibly inspired by Johann Adam Reincken's works.Wolff, 97‚Äì8. As the fugue progresses, Bach ventures into major keys (E and B) and the time between the statements increases from 1‚Äì3 bars to 7‚Äì13.

It has also been arranged for a brass quintet by Neil Balm and performed by The Canadian Brass. A transcription for viol consort was recorded by the UK group Fretwork in 2005. In 2006, the passacaglia was transcribed for handbells by Kevin McChesney and recorded by Cast of Bronze from Dallas, Texas. The passacaglia was also transcribed by Donald Hunsberger for the Eastman Wind Ensemble (symphonic wind ensemble) and for the Eastman Trombone Choir (trombone octet). In 2009, the work was transcribed for string quartet by Nicholas Kitchen for performance by the Borromeo String Quartet. In Stokowski's orchestral transcription the whole of the coda is slow and fortissimo without the possibility of a final massive rallentando. He made six commercial recordings of it between 1928 and 1972.

The game is the first graphical adventure game developed by MicroProse. It was developed using the MicroProse Adventure Development system, and made use of 256-colour graphics. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. Plot The bumbling bachelor, Rex Nebular, has been hired by Colonel Stone to retrieve a vase that holds some sentimental value for 75,000 galactars. Rex agrees and sets out for the last known location of the vase. Rex discovers that the planet where the vase was last known to reside has vanished, but his ship's sensors still detect a planetary mass and gravitational field, invisible to the naked eye. Suddenly a large warship decloaks behind him, and fires. His ship is badly damaged and is send crash landing on the strange planet, seemingly inhabited by women only. Decades ago, a vicious war between the sexes erupted on the planet. In the end, the females wiped out the male population with bio- weapons. As a result, the females were no longer able to give birth, so they had no way of continuing their species. They invented a machine that would allow them to alter their sex for short periods of time. This machine became known as the Cosmic Gender Bender (or the Gender Bender for short). The populace of the planet is divided into two classes, Keepers and (breeding) Stock. The Keepers are technologically advanced and reside underground, where they monitor the Stock. The Stock reside above ground and have a primitive culture. Their only purpose is to be impregnated by a gender bent Keeper in order to repopulate the planet. Gameplay The game is divided into three difficulty levels. Higher difficulties have more puzzles and more death encounters. The left mouse button is used for selecting options and performing actions and the right mouse button is used to look at things (an alternative to selecting the 'look' option and selecting where). Some actions like sitting on a chair are automatically performed with just a left click. To get from one room to another the mouse pointer changes to a 'GO' icon where travel is possible. To get from one place to another, Rex will need to make use of teleporters correctly entering the code. There are 10 different options, two of which are used to interact with people and seven of which are used to interact with objects. Items that are picked up have their own sub-options, most of which the protagonist Rex would not actually do (such as disassembling his binoculars). The player must also take care to prevent Rex getting killed which can happen in many places. Although Rex can die, the game has unlimited chances and the Rex's last safe position will be restored after death. For the artwork, MicroProse customised their own image processing tools for 3D-rendering allowing for smooth animation with lossless quality and minimal disk space usage. Reception Computer Gaming World opined that Rex Nebular had \\"impressive\\" sound, graphics, and rotoscoped animation. While the magazine called the plot \\"nothing new\\", it described the game as \\"a solid move into the adventure gaming genre [with] the same attention to detail that has won MicroProse raves in other products\\", and a good first attempt at competing with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line.

It is one of many Samoan log drum variants and is of the slit drum family, and therefore is also of the idiophone percussion family. It is made from a hollowed-out log, usually of Miro wood and produces a distinctive and loud sound. Different sizes of log drums offer different pitches and volumes, as well as striking the log drum in the middle or near the ends. Samoa had large Indigenous log wood Talipalau drums a variant a little larger than a pate drum and somewhat smaller than the Lali log drum variant. The dimensions of some Talipalau are large as high and in length; these Talipalau are a distant cousin to the Fijian Lali drum which were larger in size. The smaller pate was said to be introduced to Samoa by inter-married Tahitians whom visited and settled in Samoa some 500 years ago. In recent times however the pate is used together with the other lesser known traditional log drum variants as well as the Samoan fala as percussive musical instruments. Because of the widespread distribution of Samoan music through the great Polynesian expansion, the use of the PƒÅtƒì has gained much popularity among other neighbouring Polynesian Islands such as Uvea and Futuna, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Niue. There are five main Samoan wooden slit drum variants: * The logo, often carved straight from the carcass of giant felled trees, is the largest of the Samoan drum variants. Some of these drums were said to need upward of 70 men to carry them to the sea‚Äîsuch was the enormity of the drums that they could only be transported by flotation. When carved into a drum, the logo can only be played by being struck from the side, for instance by sliding the beater or very large log like playing stick across the top of the drum to hit the slit lip on the other side. The logo was used to announce the King of Samoa, High Chiefs and monarchy in times of old. The logo was also used to announce attacks and signals during times of war (see: Samoan Civil War, the Fijian Wars and also the Tongan Wars). Samoa also has recorded historical records of lesser known battles with neighboring Islands of Manono, Pukapuka, Tokelau, Tuamotu and Rarotonga, these battles may be classed as independent isolated inter-island skirmishes between large familial clan groups. * Lali are large drums that are always played in pairs by two drummers. One of them beats the larger of the two, called the Tatasi. The other drummer plays the smaller Lali in the rhythmic pattern called the Talua. Both slit drums are played with sticks called Auta. The Lali were said to be introduced 700 years ago via Fiji. * The talipalau is a medium-sized Lali drum in between the normal-sized lali and the pate. The talipalau slit drum was introduced to Samoa via Tuamotu and Tahiti. It is now part of the Island group now part of the French Polynesian Island chain. The archipelago of Samoa, Tahiti and Tuamotu developed inter-island familial bonded clans over the span of 800 years. * The pate was introduced via Tahiti 500 years ago. It is the most well-known of the drum variants simply because of its portability and easy-to- use size, as well as because of its various different tones and pitches. * The fa'aali'i-nafa is a smaller indigenous Samoan pate drum also made from Milo wood. Tahitian warriors introduced intricate wooden log pate drumming to the Samoan Islands and the Cook Islands. In Rarotonga its origins have grown into deep spiritual roots that are still found in Cook Islands drumming today. In Samoa log drums have traditionally been used in communicating over large distances in times of war and for signalling times of Sa, Chief and Village Meetings. Drums are also used in traditional song and dance. In Tahiti the people have taken a more contemporary approach where drumming and dancing is used more for entertainment and tourism than traditional functions. French Polynesia celebrates the annual Heiva i Tahiti festival where different tribes and island clan groups are able to contest against each other in dance and drumming competition the highest quality drumming in all of the South Pacific.  Construction  First a segment of a hardwood tree trunk or thick branch is taken and stripped of its bark. Holes are then bored into the log in a straight line, from one end to the other, optionally leaving some space at each end. What remains in between the holes is then chiseled out, forming the characteristic slit. After this, the log continues to be hollowed out through the slit. Both the shape of the slit and the extent that the log is gutted will affect the tone and pitch of the pate.http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=165645  References  Category:Slit drums Category:Polynesian musical instruments Category:Cook Islands music Category:Samoan words and phrases Pate (French) ","title":"Pate (instrument)"},{"id":"2277833","text":"Chaos Magick may refer to: * Chaos magic, a postmodern magical tradition * Chaos Magick (album), a 2015 album by Saturnian Mist ","title":"Chaos Magick"},{"id":"2277835","text":"Dominion Stores may refer to: *Dominion (supermarket), a former national chain in Canada, more recently operating only in the Greater Toronto Area, with the remaining locations rebranded as Metro in 2008 *Dominion Stores (Newfoundland), a division of the Loblaw Companies which continues to operate in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, separated from the national chain since 1987 ","title":"Dominion Stores"},{"id":"2277843","text":"Heracles or Herakles is the Greek mythic hero and son of the god Zeus.

He was a member of the Delaware General Assembly, the founder of the Du Pont, Bauduy & Co., wool manufacturers, and brother of √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, the founder of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company. Early life and family Gabrielle Josephine de la Fite de Pelleport Victor du Pont was born October 1, 1767 in Paris, France, son of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and Nicole Charlotte Marie Louise le D√©e. He married Gabrielle Jos√©phine de la Fite de Pelleport in 1794 and had five children, Am√©lie-√âlisabeth (1796‚Äì1869), Samuel Francis (born and died 1799), Charles Ir√©n√©e (1803‚Äì1865), Samuel Francis (1803‚Äì1865) and Julia Sophie (1806‚Äì1882). Professional career After 1784 du Pont worked with his father in King Louis XVI's Bureau of Commerce. There he had opportunities to travel around Europe and meet visiting friends of his father. In 1788 he began four years of work with the French minister to the United States in both New York City and Philadelphia. During this time, he wrote letters to his father analyzing the U.S. Constitution and the prospects for its ratification. Returning to Paris in 1793, he married and soon went back to the United States, this time as French Consul at Charleston, South Carolina. He remained there until 1797 when he was named French Consul-General at Philadelphia, but being refused recognition by President John Adams, he returned to France. For the next two years Victor du Pont assisted his father in his preparation for the whole family immigrating to the United States. They finally sailed on the American Eagle, arriving in Newport, Rhode Island, January 1, 1800. From there the father, two brothers, and wives and children, went to live at Goodstay, a house purchased for them in Bergen Point, New Jersey. Many ideas for future du Pont businesses were conceived in the coming year at Goodstay, including the one that had his brother, Eleuth√®re, beginning a gunpowder business. Victor and his brother returned to France for a year in 1801 to seek investors for that and various other prospects. He returned to New York, established a trading company, Victor du Pont de Nemours & Co., and acted as an agent for Louis Pichon, the French Consul-General and charg√© d'affairs, provisioning French troops seeking to quell the rebellion then going on in Santo Domingo. This firm went into bankruptcy in 1808, as his many advances, including those to the French government, went unreimbursed. Victor next tried his hand at farming and merchandising on the Genesee River valley of western New York. In 1811, he moved with his family to Delaware and established residence at Louviers on the Brandywine Creek, across from the Eleutherian Mills of his brother. He established a woolen mill to manufacture cotton cloth. Eleuth√®re's partner, Pierre Bauduy and son-law-law, Ferdinand Bauduy, joined the business in 1813, and it became known as Du Pont, Bauduy & Co. Soon after arriving in Delaware, Victor du Pont was elected to one of the New Castle County seats in the State House for the 1815, 1816, and 1817 sessions and later was elected to the State Senate for the 1821, 1822, and 1823 sessions. Death and legacy Victor du Pont died in Philadelphia on January 30, 1827, and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery near Greenville, Delaware. Victor du Pont was a man \\"whose friends were everywhere.\\" His son Charles took over management of the wool manufacturing business upon his death, and his other son, Samuel Francis, was a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War.

In the worst case, depending on timing, the metastable condition at Ds can propagate to Dout and through the following logic into more of the system, causing undefined and inconsistent behavior. Metastability in electronics is the ability of a digital electronics system to persist for an unbounded time in an unstable equilibrium or metastable state. In digital logic circuits, a digital signal is required to be within certain voltage or current limits to represent a '0' or '1' logic level for correct circuit operation; if the signal is within a forbidden intermediate range it may cause faulty behavior in logic gates the signal is applied to. In metastable states, the circuit may be unable to settle into a stable '0' or '1' logic level within the time required for proper circuit operation. As a result, the circuit can act in unpredictable ways, and may lead to a system failure, sometimes referred to as a \\"glitch\\". Metastability is an instance of the Buridan's ass paradox. Metastable states are inherent features of asynchronous digital systems, and of systems with more than one independent clock domain. In self-timed asynchronous systems, arbiters are designed to allow the system to proceed only after the metastability has resolved, so the metastability is a normal condition, not an error condition. In synchronous systems with asynchronous inputs, synchronizers are designed to make the probability of a synchronization failure acceptably small.Washington University St. Louis, MO Metastable states are avoidable in fully synchronous systems when the input setup and hold time requirements on flip-flops are satisfied. Example The Set‚ÄìReset NOR latch example A simple example of metastability can be found in an SR NOR latch, when Set and Reset inputs are true (R=1 and S=1) and then both transition to false (R=0 and S=0) at about the same time. Both outputs Q and are initially held at 0 by the simultaneous Set and Reset inputs. After both Set and Reset inputs change to false, the flip-flop will (eventually) end up in one of two stable states, one of Q and true and the other false. The final state will depend on which of R or S returns to zero first, chronologically, but if both transition at about the same time, the resulting metastability, with intermediate or oscillatory output levels, can take arbitrarily long to resolve to a stable state.  Arbiters  In electronics, an arbiter is a circuit designed to determine which of several signals arrive first. Arbiters are used in asynchronous circuits to order computational activities for shared resources to prevent concurrent incorrect operations. Arbiters are used on the inputs of fully synchronous systems, and also between clock domains, as synchronizers for input signals. Although they can minimize the occurrence of metastability to very low probabilities, all arbiters nevertheless have metastable states, which are unavoidable at the boundaries of regions of the input state space resulting in different outputs. Synchronous circuits Synchronizers are used when transferring signals between clock domains. One simple synchronizer design involves simply delaying the input signal (data0) from a different clock domain using multiple edge sensitive flip-flops which are locally clocked (clock0) Synchronous circuit design techniques make digital circuits that are resistant to the failure modes that can be caused by metastability. A clock domain is defined as a group of flip-flops with a common clock. Such architectures can form a circuit guaranteed free of metastability (below a certain maximum clock frequency, above which first metastability, then outright failure occur), assuming a low- skew common clock. However, even then, if the system has a dependence on any continuous inputs then these are likely to be vulnerable to metastable states. When synchronous design techniques are used, protection against metastable events causing systems failures need only be provided when transferring data between different clock domains or from an unclocked region into the synchronous system. This protection can often take the form of a series of delay flip-flops which delay the data stream long enough for metastability failures to occur at a negligible rate. Failure modes Although metastability is well understood and architectural techniques to control it are known, it persists as a failure mode in equipment. Serious computer and digital hardware bugs caused by metastability have a fascinating social history. Many engineers have refused to believe that a bistable device can enter into a state that is neither true nor false and has a positive probability that it will remain indefinite for any given period of time, albeit with exponentially decreasing probability over time., p. 4-6, p. 196, 200, eq. 6-29 , p. 4-5, eq. 1-1 However, metastability is an inevitable result of any attempt to map a continuous domain to a discrete one. At the boundaries in the continuous domain between regions which map to different discrete outputs, points arbitrarily close together in the continuous domain map to different outputs, making a decision as to which output to select a difficult and potentially lengthy process. If the inputs to an arbiter or flip-flop arrive almost simultaneously, the circuit most likely will traverse a point of metastability. Metastability remains poorly understood in some circles, and various engineers have proposed their own circuits said to solve or filter out the metastability; typically these circuits simply shift the occurrence of metastability from one place to another.Ran Ginosar. \\"Fourteen Ways to Fool Your Synchronizer\\" ASYNC 2003. Chips using multiple clock sources are often tested with tester clocks that have fixed phase relationships, not the independent clocks drifting past each other that will be experienced during operation. This usually explicitly prevents the metastable failure mode that will occur in the field from being seen or reported. Proper testing for metastability often employs clocks of slightly different frequencies and ensuring correct circuit operation.

The fraternity's name is derived from the first three letters of the Greek word for architecture, ·ºÄœÅœáŒπœÑŒµŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ.\\"The Archi Pledge\\" http://alpharhochi.org/attach/ArchiPledge- july2011-press.pdf History=Founding= APX was founded on April 11, 1914, with the joining of Sigma Upsilon at the University of Michigan and the Arcus Society at the University of Illinois to form a national fraternity for Architecture and the allied arts. Sigma Upsilon was founded four years prior by eight architecture students at Michigan, with the intent of eventually forming a national architecture fraternity, and had drafted their constitution and laws to reflect that. Two years after they were founded in 1912 they were recognized by their school as a fraternity and started negotiation with other schools to open up more chapters. In 1911 the Arcus Society was formed by 15 architecture students, at first secret and then becoming public a year later. After their recognition by their school, they started correspondence with several other schools in an effort to expand as well. One of those schools was the University of Michigan, which was the start of the collaboration of the two founding brothers of APX, Leo M. Bauer of the Arcus Society and Chandler C. Cohagen of Sigma Upsilon. According to fraternity history books, the University of Illinois chapter claims to be the first chapter of the new fraternity, by an attempt to set the meeting during a time in which Illinois was off on break, and Michigan's chapter would still be in classes, leading to the Anthemios chapter being the first chapter of the fraternity. Iktinos (Michigan) instead claims the first chapter out of pure virtue of their precursor organization existing before the one at Illinois. Both the Iktinos and Anthemios chapters are considered the founding chapters, and as such, share the same cadency mark. The two founding brothers met on April 11, 1914, at the Hotel Sherman in Chicago, where they selected the new name of the combined organization, the new constitution and by-laws, and the coat of arms. The brothers decided to keep the colors of the Arcus Society, azure and sanguine, and the white rose, a symbol of Sigma Upsilon to represent both organizations. They also selected the names of the new chapters from a list of prominent Greek, Roman (and later on Egyptian) architects. Illinois selected Anthemios as their name and Michigan, Iktinos. =Expansion and World War I= Alpha Rho Chi set expansion as their first goal, wanting to embody their vision of being a national architecture fraternity. Several existing architecture organizations petitioned to join, but the only Tau Epsilon Chi of Ohio State University was accepted, being installed as the Demetrios Chapter on February 25, 1916. The Cyma Club became the Mnesicles Chapter at the University of Minnesota on October 10, 1916. Recruiting efforts remained active, but with the start of World War I, most of the brothers entered the armed services and the number of chapters stayed at four. =The Great Depression, World War II and Contraction= After the war, the Kallikrates Chapter was installed at the University of Virginia on February 15, 1922. The Andronicus Chapter was installed a month later, on March 11, 1922, with eleven charter members at the University of Southern California.The Archi Pledge 2017 edition Expansion continued at a rapid pace with the addition of members at Kansas State, which formed the Paeonios Chapter on February 10, 1923. Ten members of the Delta Club at the University of Texas were initiated on April 19, 1924, to form the Dinocrates Chapter. The Polyklitos Chapter at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie-Mellon University) was established on May 24, 1924. With the addition of the Theron Chapter at Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State University) on May 23, 1926, the fraternity stood at ten active chapters and was truly national in stature. The Depression and World War II affected the strength of the local chapters, and several failed to survive. Only six chapters returned ‚Äì Anthemios, Iktinos, Demetrios, Mnesicles, Andronicus, and Kallikrates ‚Äì with strong alumni support and renewed membership. In 1954, the Vitruvius colony was established at Pennsylvania State University, and it was installed as a chapter on March 27, 1955. =Post-war, further expansion= Next to be installed was a very active group from Arizona State University, who became the Satyros Chapter on May 13, 1962. Two surprised representatives from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) were initiated at the 31st National Convention; in turn they assisted with the installation of the Metagenes Chapter on March 23, 1969. With the addition of the Xenocles Chapter at the University of Texas at Arlington on September 13, 1970, Alpha Rho Chi returned to its former high point of ten active chapters. During the early 1970s, fraternity membership in general dropped again as controversy raged on college campuses over the Vietnam War and any \\"establishment\\" organization. Alpha Rho Chi continued on, installing the Cleisthenes Chapter at the University of Houston on March 11, 1972. The beginning of the 1980s saw college fraternities enjoy a renaissance and Alpha Rho Chi added four new chapters. In June 1980, the vigorous Daedalus Chapter was founded at the California Polytechnic State University to become the fraternity's second West Coast chapter. After a freezing initiation night at the Anthemios chapter house, the Daphnis Chapter of the University of Arkansas was installed on November 23, 1980. The Heracleides Chapter of the University of Oklahoma was installed with a down-home, Texas-style bar-b-que at Xenocles on September 6, 1981. After collecting the required ten members for initiation, the Rhoecus chapter was installed at the University of Kansas on April 8, 1984. The Apollodorus colony was bussed from the University of Florida to Metagenes, a 13-hour trip. They were officially installed as a chapter in Gainesville, Florida, on April 10, 1986. On March 29, 1992, Alpha Rho Chi installed the Pytheos Chapter at the University of Nebraska. The Seshait Chapter at Florida A&M; University was installed on March 12, 1994, becoming the first chapter with an Egyptian namesake. =The New Millennium= The co-op program at the University of Cincinnati created a unique installation for the Rabirius Chapter, whose members were initiated in two separate ceremonies; one held in Cincinnati on November 4, 2000, and the remainder of the members were initiated on January 20, 2001. In September 2001, a professor began correspondence with the fraternity in hopes of establishing a chapter of Alpha Rho Chi for the students at the University of Memphis. Up to this point, Alpha Rho Chi had limited expansion to accredited schools of architecture; however, after revisiting the fraternity's original objectives and mission, it was determined that there was no reason to exclude the University of Memphis, and on October 19, 2002, the Imhotep Chapter was installed in Champaign, Illinois. Improved communications, including the alpharhochi.org website and nearly universal email access, helped interested students of architecture discover and contact the national fraternity, accelerating the pace of expansion of new and reactivated chapters. Nicon Chapter was established at Florida International University on July 11, 2004. In the Northeast, the Vitruvius Chapter sponsored two new chapters simultaneously. Vitruvius installed the Domitian Chapter from the New Jersey Institute of Technology on January 30, 2005, and the Senenmut Chapter from the University at Buffalo on February 26, 2005‚Äîthe chapter's fiftieth anniversary. A colony at Tulane University was preparing its petition to establish a chapter when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, closing the school for a semester and scattering the students across the country and to other continents. After regrouping, the Hadrian Chapter was finally installed on November 4, 2006. University of Illinois chapter house After rocky beginnings, students at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco successfully formed the Cossutius Colony, and were installed at the Andronicus chapter house on January 20, 2008. Representatives from Andronicus, Daedalus, Satyros, Anthemios, Hadrian, and Vitruvius chapters were on hand to usher in the newest chapter. =Recent history= The Anthemios chapter house is currently on the National Register of Historic Places at the University of Illinois. A centennial celebration is planned at the Anthemios chapter house beginning in 2014 sponsored by the Anthemios Alumni Association. The Andronicus chapter house is on the list of Historic Cultural Monuments by the City of Los Angeles, and is awaiting placement on the Federal Register of Historic Structures. The Anthemios house has 18 bedrooms, most which used to be double occupancy. Currently, only rooms 5‚Äì7, 16 and 17 are capable of double occupancy. Keeping up with the progressive era, the Anthemios house changed to coed bathrooms in the late 2000s due to the influx of female brothers. In 2014, the Olynthius chapter was installed at the University of Maryland. In the spring of 2017, Alpha Rho Chi welcomed two new chapters into their fold; the Theodorus chapter was established at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in February and was followed closely by the Amenophis chapter at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale in April. On February 1, 2020 the dormant Demetrios chapter was revived and installed at The Ohio State University. As of June 2020, Alpha Rho Chi has one colony in formation, Skopas, located at Syracuse University. The Alpha Rho Chi Medal The Alpha Rho Chi Bronze Medal is awarded annually at accredited schools of architecture in the United States and Canada to honor graduating seniors who have demonstrated leadership, service, and the promise of professional merit. The recipients of the medal are decided by the faculty of each school. Membership in the fraternity is not a criterion for the award, nor is membership conferred to the medal's recipients. The medal program was established in 1931. Designed by sculptor Robert Merrell Gage, the medal is cast in bronze and features an image of a seated Athena holding a skyscraper. On occasion, Alpha Rho Chi recognizes other individuals with two other classes of medals. The fraternity awards the Alpha Rho Chi Silver Medal for fraternal service. The Gold Alpha Rho Chi Medal honors an outstanding practitioner of architecture or an allied art. Recent recipients of the gold medal include I.M. Pei and Samuel Balen. Master Architects of Alpha Rho Chi \\"Master Architect\\" is a special classification of membership in the fraternity to honor brothers who have gained national prominence in the field of architecture, the allied arts, or who have made significant contributions to the built environment. The following individuals have been installed as Master Architect (with year honored): *Nathan Clifford Ricker (1914) *Cass Gilbert (1924) *Eliel Saarinen (1942) *John Wellborn Root, Jr. (1951) *Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1966) *Richard Buckminster Fuller (1970) *I.M.

History=Capital island dispute= On 26 October 2009, the government decided to move the capital of Shaviyani Atoll from Funadhoo to Milandhoo, citing more ease for the people. However, this decision was overruled by parliament in June 2010, and Funadhoo was reinstated as the capital of the atoll, much to the dismay of both the government and the people of Milandhoo. This decision was vetoed by President Nasheed, and Milandhoo continued as the seat of the atoll office. The issue surfaced once again on February 26, 2011 when home rule was introduced into the country and the atoll offices were to be rebranded as the secretariats for the newly formed atoll councils. According to the Decentralization Bill, under which the councils were formed, the respective secretariats were to be seated in the capital islands of each atoll as stipulated in the new constitution of 2008, which in Shaviyani Atoll's case is Funadhoo. In the first atoll council meeting, it was decided to move the secretariat from Milandhoo to Funadhoo, as per the law states. The government responded with threats to dissolve the council if the move is followed through, and appealed the order of the Funadhoo Magistrate Court to carry out the move. On March 1, after the Milandhoo Magistrate Court ordered the work of the secretariat to return to Milandhoo, an order backed by the President, riot police was deployed to Funadhoo to \\"urge the council to respect the court order\\" issued by Milandhoo. The following day, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ruled that the Milandhoo court order was invalid and that the Funadhoo court order was, a ruling which the government and Milandhoo did not accept. On April 6, the parliament overrode the initial presidential veto on the capital island legislature, and declared Funadhoo as the legitimate capital island. In 2012, all of the materials used in Milandhoo were transferred to Funadhoo. It is notable that as of 2013, the official website of the President's Office does not display an address for the Shaviyani Atoll Council. Geography Bodu Thakurufaanu concealed the ship Kalhuoffummi at night, while fighting against the Portugueseleft This administrative atoll is 37 miles long, it is the third atoll from the northern edge of the country, and It comprises 51 islands of which 16 are inhabited. The islands in this atoll are small with half of the islands having less than 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of land area. There are 9 islands that are smaller than one hectare (2.49 acres). These islands comprise 18% of the islands. The smallness of the atoll indicates to the islands' vulnerability to environmental impacts. Population The population of the atoll is 12,091 as of the 2014 census. Economy Fishing and agriculture form the mainstay of the atoll's economy. Fishing is engaged in throughout the year, with pole, line and reef fishing practised in various islands in the atoll. The atoll is also known for craftsmanship, such as mat and rope weaving. Several inhabitants work in the tourism industry and other commercial trades in the Maldivian capital, Mal√©. Administration The atoll is assigned the Maldivian letter 'Shaviyani' and the Latin letter 'C' as the atoll code. The atoll Council is responsible for public services, development and economic affairs. The Shaviyani Atoll Office was established on 9 September 1958 by the state. Until 1 January 1968, the atoll office was located in Lhaimagu which was the capital of the atoll. The government declared that effective from 1 January 1968, the capital would be Farukolhu Funadhoo (Funadhoo) and hence, the atoll office was transferred to Funadhoo. Health Basic medical care was introduced in the atoll with the establishment of a health centre on 25 December 1970 in the island of Lhaimagu. This health centre was shifted to Farukolhu Funadhoo (now Funadhoo) in 1971 when the island was made the atoll capital. This health centre is now developed to Atoll Hospital which has a well equipped laboratory and operation theater facilities and are manned by a gynecologist, anesthetist and a general practitioner. Other than Atoll Hospital, there are 13 Health Centre in the atoll with Doctor and Nurses. Majority of the population of the atoll have access to safe drinking water. Around 99% of the households have been provided with water storage tanks on tsunami recovery program. Most households have safe sanitation facilities. Education Primary education is universal in all inhabited islands of Shaviyani Atoll. All the schools in the atoll providing education to Grade 10. And the Atoll Education Centre, Atoll School provide education to Grade 12. Most of the secondary schools yet offer only commerce stream subjects. The schools which offer both the Science and Commerce stream subjects are the Shaviyani Atoll Education Centre in Komandoo, Atoll School in Kanditheemu, Funadhoo School and Milandhoo School. Some of the School introduce TVET programs to the students. Most schools have computer labs funded jointly by parents, government and the Shaviyani Atoll Development Project.

It consisted of Baa, Lhaviyani, Noonu and Raa Atolls. Its capital was Felivaru. Its population (2006 census) was 43,539. Before Decentralization Act was approved by the Parliament of Maldives, President Mohamed Nasheed appointed Atoll Councilors and Island Councilors to apply the concept of Decentralization to the Administrations of the Councils. First Appointed Noonu Atoll Councilor In The Term of Mohamed Nasheed Presidency thumb As the first Noonu Atoll Councilor Mr. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu was appointed at the date of 18 August 2009 and remained till 25 December 2010 until the Decentralization Bill was approved by the Parliament of Maldives. When the Local Government Decentralization Act was established Atoll Councilors and Island Councilors were elected by the vote of the people who belongs to the constituency. Local Council election was elected on 11 February 2011 and Mr. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu remained the constituency seat for Manadhoo Constituency from February 2011 till February 2014. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu was elected by the Atoll Council Members as the Vice President of Noonu Atoll Council. Geography The whole district consists of 71 islands. 13 of these island are inhabited: Fodhdhoo, Hebadhoo, Holhudhoo, Kedhikolhudhoo, Kudafari, Landhoo, Lhohi, Maafaru, Maalhendhoo, Magoodhoo, Miladhoo and Velidhoo. The channel to the west of Noonu Atoll is called Baraveli Kandu. \\"Baraveli\\" means hermit crab in local Dhivehi language. Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).Tim Godfrey, Atlas of the Maldives, Atoll Editions 2004 Ecology Noonu Atoll has the highest density of swarming fishes which can be found in the Maldives, especially Fusiliers and Snappers. It also has a huge spinner dolphin population. The underwater world is also famous for scuba diving. The best known spots are Orimas Thila, a shark point for grey and white tip reef sharks, as well as Christmastree Rock (Vavathi Kurohli Thila) which is famous for the abundant soft coral life. Economy Noonu Atoll is home to six luxury resorts: NOKU Maldives (Kudafunafaru), Soneva Jani (Medhufaru), Cheval Blanc (Randheli), The Sun Siyam (Irufushi), Robinson Club Noonu (Orivaru) and Velaa Private Island (Orimasvaru).

It is the seat for the borough of Rossendale. The town lies 15 miles north of Manchester, 22 miles east of Preston and 45 miles south east of the county town of Lancaster. Nearby towns include Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom. History The name Rawtenstall has been given two possible interpretations. The older is a combination of the Middle English routen ('to roar or bellow'), from the Old Norse rauta and the Old English stall 'pool in a river' (Ekwall 1922, 92). The second, more recent one, relates to Rawtenstall's identification as a cattle farm in 1324 and combines the Old English ruh 'rough' and tun-stall 'the site of a farm or cow- pasture', or possibly, 'buildings occupied when cattle were pastured on high ground' The earliest settlement at Rawtenstall was probably in the early Middle Ages, during the time when it formed part of the Rossendale Valley in the Honour of Clitheroe, and consisted of simple dwellings for forest servants and animals. More substantial buildings may have followed in the 15th and 16th centuries with corn and flour mills. The town entered a major period of growth during the Industrial Revolution, as new mills were constructed to process cotton. The climate and weather were conducive to the industry, as was the town's nearby location to the rapidly developing industrial and mercantile centre at Manchester, dubbed 'Cottonopolis'. Only a few of these mills survive today, and none are still operational. During this period, the brothers Thomas, David and Peter Whitehead became important entrepreneurs in the town. They built a number of mills, including one of the earliest mills in the valley, at Lower Mill, and the still existing Ilex Mill. They also built substantial houses for themselves at Holly Mount, as well as large numbers of terraced houses for their workers. Other industries active in this period included quarrying and small scale coal mining, as well as an expanding commercial sector. As with many small mid-Lancashire towns, it saw a population decline in the 20th century, going from 30,000 inhabitants in the 1911 census to 21,500 in the 1971 census. With the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries, shoemaking became one of the last survivors. this was usually known locally as the slipper industry, since slipper-making grew from the local processing of felt, which itself grew from the textile industry. The firm of H. W. Tricketts, in nearby Waterfoot, had been a major producer and exporter of footwear across the British Empire, but shoemaking declined rapidly from the 1980s. Firms closed as production moved overseas, and the remaining companies are largely importers. The church of St Nicholas (Church of England) is at Newchurch (rebuilt 1825) as is the Roman Catholic church of St Peter (1892). Other churches are St Michael's Lumb, St James's Waterfoot, St Anne's Edgeside, St John's Cloughfold, St Mary's Oakenhead, St John the Evangelist's Crawshawbooth, St Mary and All Saints Goodshaw (rebuilt 1790). Another RC church (dedicated to St James the Less) is at Oakenhead and there are a number of Nonconformist chapels.Fleetwood-Hesketh, P. (1955) Murray's Lancashire Architectural Guide. London: John Murray; p. 168 Governance The coat of arms of the former Rawtenstall Borough CouncilA local board was formed for the town in 1874 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Lower Booths (Rawtenstall itself), Higher Booths, Newchurch and Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley and Cowpe, Lench, Newhall Hey and Hall Carr, and part of Tottington (Higher End) in the ancient parish of Bury. Subsequently, Rawtenstall was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891 and in 1894 a civil parish was created to match the borders of the borough. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 Rawtenstall became part of the Borough of Rossendale. Rawtenstall is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, after the constituency of Rossendale was abolished in 1983. The constituency sends one member of parliament to the House of Commons. Jake Berry MP has been the Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010. Geography Its neighbouring communities in the valley are Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom. The area is bounded to the north by Loveclough and Whitewell Bottom, to the east by Waterfoot and Cowpe and to the south by Townsend Fold and Horncliffe. The River Irwell passes through the town on the first part of its route between Bacup and Manchester, collecting Limy Water close to the junction of Bury Road with Bocholt Way. Over recent years the area has become increasingly popular with visitors, attracted by historic buildings, dramatic landscapes and fine walking country. Climate Like most of the United Kingdom, Rawtenstall has an oceanic climate. Transport Rawtenstall bus station, September 2008The town has had bus routes since the early 1930s. The district is currently served locally by Rosso, with a large bus station in the town centre, as well as frequent express services X43 to Burnley, Nelson and Manchester run by Burnley Bus Company. In 2007 a proposal to demolish part of the previous bus station and build a Lidl store on the site was agreed and the new store was finally completed in 2009. Lancashire County Council and Rossendale Borough Council then eventually replaced the old bus station with a modern bus interchange, which commenced service on Sunday 24 November 2019. Rawtenstall railway station also serves the town, but since the closure of the main line to Manchester, it now operates mainly as a tourist route, as part of the East Lancashire Railway, of which Rawtenstall station forms the northern terminus. The M66 motorway from Manchester is linked to Rawtenstall via the A56 Edenfield bypass, allowing for a driving time between Manchester and Rawtenstall of around half an hour. Today, Rawtenstall's nearest rail station is in Acrrington and over the border in Yorkshire, Todmorden. The nearest metro link is Bury Interchange. Education The town has a number of primary and secondary (high) schools, including Bellmont School, St Paul's C of E Primary, Cloughfold Primary School, Leabrook School, Alder Grange Community and Technology School and All Saints' Catholic High School. Though located in Waterfoot, rather than Rawtenstall, the traditional grammar school, Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School takes part of its name from the town. Rawtenstall also has a public library, built in 1906 with Carnegie funding. The Town Centre Lidl \\"The Witch Way\\" in Bank Street (X43) Fitzpatrick's, \\"the last temperance bar in England\\" By 2000, Rawtenstall's 1960s shopping centre had become deserted and boarded-up, and after 2003 various proposals were put forward regarding reconstruction or refurbishment. An agreement between Rossendale Council and the owners of the Rawtenstall centre, Ashcap, in February 2011, was said to \\"improve Rawtenstall town centre\\". In late 2011 the shopping centre was demolished, creating a new town square area, where local markets and other events are infrequently held. Rossendale Council funded the demolition using money set aside for a public pool in neighbouring town Haslingden. This move was controversial locally, but the completed bus station has also attracted positive comment. Since 2017 several new bars, shops, bistros and venues have opened in the centre of the town, along with a rejuvenated market under new management. Close by to the Cricket Ground is the Weavers Cottage. This is a characterful 18th century loom shop, which has been restored as a small museum containing a Victorian kitchen, a clog shop and a working hand loom. The Rossendale Valley's local newspaper, the Rossendale Free Press was originally based in Rawtenstall, before being bought out by the Manchester Evening News in 2009 and subsequently moving to Manchester. Rawtenstall also has one of the largest indoor markets in Rossendale (a sign declaring it to be \\"probably the friendliest market in the world\\"), which suffered a serious arson attack in March 2011. The town is also home to the traditional herbalist and temperance bar Fitzpatrick's Herbal Health, which claims to be the oldest brewer of sarsaparilla and dandelion and burdock in the country. Fitzpatrick's gained television acclaim in April 2005 when it won the Famous Sarsaparilla Taste-off on ITV. It is the last bar of its kind in England. The acclaimed fashion boutique Sunday Best was opened in 1971 by Jan Shutt and is situated on Bank Street. Sunday Best won The Daily Telegraph magazine's best shop in Britain award for women's fashion in 2011 whilst Roland's Florist on Bacup Road was runner up in the best florist category. The awards were judged by TV shopping guru Mary Portas. Police facilities in Rawtenstall were one of five sites used for the training of new recruits to the Lancashire Constabulary. In late 2011, due to funding cuts, Rawtenstall Police Station, along with various other stations in the area, closed down. Rawtenstall is also the location of the area's county and magistrates' courts. Culture The now demolished Valley Centre in RawtenstallRawtenstall was featured in the documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? which was aired on BBC2 at 9.00pm on 2 February 2006. The subject, actress Jane Horrocks, was born in Rawtenstall in 1964. The Irwell Sculpture Trail also runs through the town, where four of the sculptures are located; the Whispering Wall, the Gateway, the Willow Tree and the Bocholt Tree. The last, by sculptor Bernard Tindall, celebrates Rossendale's twinning links with the town of Bocholt, Germany. The Shoe Trail also hits the outskirts of the town, and goes through nearby places such as Whitaker Park. Whitaker Park and The Whitaker Whitaker Park is located on the outskirts of the town centre, between Haslingden Road (A681) and Haslingden Old Road. It consists of the former house of the mill owner George Hardman, built in the 1840s, and originally standing in 28 acres of parkland. It is still set in extensive landscaped grounds. Donated to the township of Rawtenstall in 1902 by Richard Whitaker, who brought the house from Hardman for the purposes of civic recreation, the property is now known as The Whitaker, previously Rossendale Museum and Art Gallery. The gardens and surrounding land are laid out as a public park. The park itself has tennis courts, a bowling green, basketball court, an Incredible Edible area, a skateboard area and a playground as well as formal gardens and fountains. The museum contains exhibits of local history, including information about the house as it was originally. There is an extensive exhibition of taxidermy, whilst gallery areas are used to display contemporary art. Arthur Mee considers it 'one of the best small museums in the North', saying \\"...perhaps the most fascinating things in the museum are the Domestic Bygones, with hourglasses, toys and spinning wheels, snuff boxes and tinder boxes, the sand dredgers used before blotting-paper was known, rushlights and moulds for making candles, a grand collection of the homely things our forefathers (sic) used\\". In 2019 The Whitaker was awarded a National Lottery Heritage Fund award of ¬£1.7 million to convert the former barn and stables. This will double its size, and enable the museum to develop its displays, its cafe and bar, and the education spaces. As a result, it will close for much of 2020 for the work to be completed. Sport Rawtenstall is home to the North of England's largest dry ski-slope. Ski Rossendale is located five minutes from Rawtenstall town centre in the Oakenhead area, directly above Whitaker Park and Rossendale Museum. Over its 40-year existence it had seen world record attempts and was used by Olympic athletes and novice skiers. It re-opened after a period of closure in November 2011 with new funding, with a large ceremonial fireworks display on its opening day, Bonfire Night. Cricket at Rawtenstall Cricket Club's Bacup Road groundRawtenstall Cricket Club, who compete in the Lancashire League, have their home ground, Worswick Memorial Ground, within the town. Rawtenstall is also home to Rossendale RUFC, who compete in the North Premier.

In an April 2012 interview, Khin Nyunt, formerly the country's prime minister, claimed that he personally intervened to save Aung San Suu Kyi's life during the massacre, by mobilising his men to bring her to a safe location at a nearby army cantonment. Commission observations In making this statement, the Asian Legal Resource Centre concurs with the preliminary findings of the Ad Hoc Commission on the Depayin Massacre, presented on 25 June 2003. In its summary observations on the attack, the Ad Hoc Commission observed that the attack was clearly premeditated and well organised, as indicated by the following: # Up to 5000 persons were brought to a remote rural location for the purpose of attacking the convoy. # The attackers were all well-armed and located strategically at two killing sites. # Before the motorcade arrived, local authorities threatened people living in nearby villages to stay indoors. # The authorities systematically searched for and arrested survivors of the attack. ALRC opinion The Asian Legal Resource Centre is of the opinion that the massacre at Depayin clearly amounts to a \\"widespread or systematic attack directed against [a] civilian population, with a knowledge of the attack\\" (article 7.1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court) and is therefore a crime against humanity. To date, however, there has been no serious action taken on the massacre.

It is located in the Westend-S√ºd district. It covers a surface of 22 hectares. It is major tourist attraction.Palmengarten, Frankfurt am Main Nightingale Garden Company Limited.  History  Frankfurt Palm Garden in ca. 1890-1900 Bond of the Palmengaten-Gesellschaft, issued 1. July 1898 Like many public sites in Frankfurt, it was privately financed and implemented by the architect Heinrich Siesmayer. Work was completed in 1871 and opened to the public. Marc Di Duca, et. all Lonely Planet Germany PalmenGarten Lonely Planet, 1582 pages 2019 , One colorful visit was from the American entertainer Buffalo Bill who brought his Western show in 1890. In 1931, it was taken over by the city of Frankfurt but was later transferred to the American occupation authorities after World War II. When the Palmengarten was returned to the city's hands in the sixties, a major reconstruction effort was begun. Halls destroyed in the war were redeveloped and expanded. In 1992 the reconstruction finished completely and the Palmengarten shined in its new form. Directly next to the area of the Palmengarten is the Frankfurt Botanical Garden, which formerly belonged to the biology department of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt and is now administered by the Palmengarten.  Collection  Palmengarten (2004) The botanical exhibits are organized according to their origin in free-air or climatized greenhouses, which also contain numerous tropical and subtropical plants. At the entry to the garden half of the original social building of 1905, which was rebuilt again, currently serves as the main entrance to the Palmengarten. To the right and left of the entrance we find exhibition rooms and teaching rooms. On the first floor in the south wing are some carnivorous plants, in the north wing are some American pineapple plants, which are grown indoors. The visitor is \\"in situ\\", information points on the ecology and geography of everything on display. Greenhouse in the Palmengarten. * The Rose Garden Once the entrance building is left behind, we find the ¬´Rosaleda¬ª, with a characteristic geometric style of plant distribution. A pergola gives the formal touch of rose garden, with its paths and its flower beds carefully cared for. The Rosenbrunn house is located in the middle, built in the early garden style of 1884, it had been part of the office buildings. Themed gardens (for example: with scent roses or the so-called \\"classic roses\\") delimit the rose garden to the north and south. * Palmenhaus This is the main core of the original Palmengarten, it was built in 1869 and is one of the largest buildings of its kind found in Europe. Along with a large number of subtropical palm trees, and covering the lower part of the forest canopy are tree ferns, plants with long and tender stems, and broad-leaved plants, which together produce an image of great subtropical exuberance. There is also a stream that cascades down from the high back of the hill-shaped structure. In a grotto-like passageway under the hill, it is shown in aquariums, a colorful tropical underwater world. * Rhododendrumgarten In the western part of the gardens and bordering the lake that is located here, the Rhododendrongarten ('Garden of rhododendrons') was created in 1989. Here a large variety of hybrids of species from eastern Asia and North America were planted side by side. These plants need a soil rich in humus and very acid for their development. This area is a spectacle of color in late May and early June when they bloom. * The rockery Anemone altaica, in the rockery. It is located at the highest point of the garden, a rocky hill with an imposing waterfall, from here you get one of the best views. The rockery (Der Steingarten, or Garden among the stones), is located on the flanks of the rocky hill, and it was completely renovated in the 80s. With acidic soils and Alkaline in small gaps between the rocks are these plants from all the mountainous regions of the planet. * Heather Garden Where the rockery ends, in the east, the heather garden begins with its attractive color in the blooms of late summer. Also appealing is the gradation of shades of green presented by the rest of the year, this collection of wild and crossed species of the genera Erica and Calluna. * Bush garden It is located in the northern part of the garden. This part of the garden has puddled areas, with abundant water and a stream accompanies along the main path of the walk. Here the plants grow grouped in bushes along the stream. Plants are found as green herbs, where the brushstrokes of color are provided by Asteraceae. The Palmengarten in the fall. * The flower house An enclave worth visiting in the garden is the \\"Flower House\\". The house has about 200 m¬≤ and is divided into hot and cold zones. Here the visitor can find flowering plants at any time of the year. Here the plants are periodically renewed. * The alpine house This is the house Leonhardsbrunn flanked on both sides by striking greenhouse towers, it was rebuilt according to old plans. Here the plants are shown with the provenance and the expedition in which they were collected. In the western tower we find citrus, the eastern tower is dedicated to plants from the island of Tasmania. Plants in the southern half of the Earth sphere are grown in the central structure. * Steppe meadow In the western part of the Tropicarium in a flat and drier area than in other parts of the garden, there is a collection of plants that develop in full sun. They are plants from the steppe estuary regions of Eurasia and the America s. In the middle of the garden is a glade. Here you will find a selection of forage grasses and among them meadow flowers develop, just as they can be found in any meadow in a field that has been left uncultivated. * The subantarctic house These facilities were inaugurated in 1992, bringing together plants from the cold regions of the southern half of the globe. The characteristics of the vegetation are forest, shrub, and swamp areas. The red sandstone dominates on the left, where the plants of the Patagonia, Archipelago Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands are located, being delimited by a small swampy area. On the right side with a firm gray, are plants from New Zealand and neighboring islands. * The tropicarium The plants of the Tropicarium are not shown according to their continents or countries, but are grouped according to their biotope. What is attempted is to show the variety and richness of the tropical zone. The greenhouse \\"Tropicarium Sur\\" is a small structure that contains plants from semi-arid zones, savanna, and foggy desert. * Cactus garden This area deserves a special mention. Shown during the warm months from May through September, it is a collection of succulent plants that withstand harsh winters. They come from America, Africa and from the Canary Islands. In between these plants a large variety of fuchsias are displayed at the same time. The Papageno Theater in the Palmengarten.

Born in Ipswich, Queensland, Davis resides in Bundaberg, Queensland and in Spain. Known for his sprinting ability, he started competitive cycling at the age of 10, and turned professional in 2002. He is also the brother of fellow cyclist, Scott Davis, and was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. Career In 2004 and 2005 he participated in the Tour de France, coming fifth in the points classification at the 2005 Tour de France behind the winner, Thor Hushovd of Norway, and fellow Australians Stuart O'Grady (2nd) and Robbie McEwen (3rd), and Kazakh champion Alexander Vinokourov (4th). In 2006, Davis was one of the riders of the team implicated in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case. However, on 26 July 2006, Davis was cleared by Spanish officials. He made his debut with Quick Step on 3 September 2008 in the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen ‚Äì Aartselaar race after reaching an agreement with Patrick Lefevere for the following two seasons and obtained a definitive free pass from his former team, Mitsubishi-Jartazi.

It later branched out into Europe and the United States. The company first produced game shows, then branched into soap operas in 1973. In 1995 Reg Grundy sold the company to Pearson Television, which has since become known as FremantleMedia and is part of the RTL Group (in turn 90% owned by Bertelsmann). In 2006 FremantleMedia merged Grundy Television and Crackerjack Productions to form Fremantle Australia. Until 2013 the Grundy name still existed in Germany as Grundy Light Entertainment and in Italy as Grundy Productions Italy.  History  After success in radio, Reg Grundy's first TV production was Wheel of Fortune which launched on Nine Network in 1959. Another show with this title, although based on a Merv Griffin production, celebrated its 25th anniversary in Australia, a week before its cancellation in July 2006. In the late 1980s Reg Grundy established Grundy World Wide Limited. He created and operated local, independent television production and distribution companies in Europe, Asia and North and South America. Pearson Television (now Fremantle) acquired the Grundy group of companies in April 1995. On 30 August 2006, FremantleMedia announced they would merge Grundy Television with their other Australian production company, Crackerjack Productions, to form a single \\"super\\" production company called \\"FremantleMedia Australia\\". The new company is now managed by the management team from Crackerjack, with Mark Fennessy as chief executive officer and his brother Carl Fennessy as chief operating officer. Simon Spalding (Fremantle Director of Asia Pacific Operations) said in an interview that Grundy Television's premises in Sydney are to be refurbished and that once complete, all Sydney based staff will be located there. He claims that this will help to create a 'deeper' production facility and is not a cost-cutting exercise. Spalding also said that although the Grundy name would be disappearing, he was looking at how FremantleMedia could retain the Grundy name and the heritage associated with it.  Programmes  See Fremantle Australia  Divisions  The company had several divisions in other countries: =France= Grundy France EURL - the now defunct French division (later Pearson Television France in 1999) which was best known for producing Questions pour un champion, along with other programs Le Juste Prix and La Gym de Neurones. =Germany= Grundy Light Entertainment - the German division, which produces such shows as Ruck Zuck (best known of Grundy's German game shows), Das Quiz mit J√∂rg Pilawa, Q-Boot, along owing and producing German versions of RTL Group formats Family Feud (Familien-Duell), Sale of the Century (Hopp oder Top), and The Price Is Right (Der Preis ist hei√ü). Since September 2013, the company has been renamed \\"UFA Show & Factual\\". =Italy= Grundy Productions Italy - Italian division, which was founded in 1980 and produced programs like Furore and Un posto al sole, now known as Fremantle Italia SpA. =Spain= Grundy Productions Spain - Now known as Fremantle Espa√±a S.A.. =Sweden= Their Swedish operation produced a local version of Sons and Daughters - Skilda v√§rldar. It also produced the Swedish version of Card Sharks - Lagt kort ligger. =United States and United Kingdom= Reg Grundy Productions was the American and British wing of the worldwide television production company Grundy Worldwide, which was founded by Australian television producer Reg Grundy. Reg Grundy Productions was responsible for the production of two highly successful daytime game shows on NBC during the 1980s, Sale of the Century and Scrabble, and produced a revival of Scrabble in 1993. The company also produced Time Machine (a history-themed game show similar in format to The Price is Right) and Scattergories for NBC, Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak for ABC and Small Talk for The Family Channel. Of the game shows Grundy produced in America, only Sale and the original Scrabble were hits; Time Machine lasted 16 weeks, Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak, and Small Talk had 13 week runs each and Scattergories and the revival of Scrabble were cancelled after five months (the latter returning only on a limited basis). Frequent announcers of the company's game shows included Jay Stewart, Don Morrow, Gene Wood and Charlie Tuna. The company also produced re-edited versions of two highly successful soaps out of Australia, Prisoner and on some markets Neighbours. Bill Mason (was also EP of Sale of the Century, Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune New Zealand) operated the U.S.-based Grundy operation, and was the executive in charge of production for all of the Grundy-based game shows in the States. Former Concentration co- creator Robert Noah was also the driving force behind several of the aforementioned game shows, including Time, Sale and Scrabble. In the UK, Reg Grundy Productions produced two big hit shows for the BBC called Going for Gold and Small Talk. They also produced three cult shows for ITV called Keynotes, Celebrity Squares and Man O Man. before becoming a joint production company with Channel 5 to produce a few more shows such as 100%, Whittle, Night Fever, Fort Boyard, Win Beadle's Money, One to Win (a revival of Going for Gold), and The Desert Forges. It also owned the rights to two Bruce Forsyth game shows such as Play Your Cards Right and The Price Is Right as well as a Tim Clark game show called Give Us a Clue, a Michael Barrymore game show called Strike It Lucky, a Paul O'Grady game show called Lily Savage's Blankety Blank, a Dale Winton game show called Dale's Supermarket Sweep and a Liza Tarbuck game show called Blockbusters. Reg Grundy Productions was based in West Los Angeles near Century City, and was responsible for helping start the career of television producer and talent agent entrepreneur Sean Perry, whose father, Jim Perry hosted Sale of the Century. The company is now defunct, having been folded into Fremantle North America, along with Mark Goodson Productions.

There are differences in flavor depending on the geography of where the sauce is made: in Europe it is generally slightly sour-tasting, while in North America it is typically more heavily sweetened. History The recipe for cranberry sauce appears in the 1796 edition of The Art of Cookery by Amelia Simmons, the first known cookbook authored by an American. Although the Pilgrims may have been aware of the wild cranberries growing in the Massachusetts Bay area, sugar was scarce, so it's unlikely that cranberry sauce would have been among the dishes served at the First Thanksgiving meal. Cranberries aren't mentioned by any primary sources for the First Thanksgiving meal. The only foods mentioned are \\"Indian corn\\", wild turkey and waterfowl, and venison. The rest remains a matter of speculation among food historians. Although stuffings are not mentioned in primary sources, it was a common way to prepare birds for the table in the 17th century. According to a \\"Thanksgiving Primer\\" published by the Plimoth Plantation, cranberries may have been used in the stuffing recipes, but it's unlikely they would have been made into a sauce because sugar was very scarce. Cranberry sauce was first offered to consumers in North America in 1912 in Hanson, Massachusetts. Canned cranberry sauce appeared on the market in 1941, allowing the product to be sold year-round. Cranberry sauce can be used with a variety of meats, including turkey, pork, chicken, and ham. Preparation The most basic cranberry sauce consists of cranberries boiled in sugar water until the berries pop and the mixture thickens. Some recipes include other ingredients such as slivered almonds, orange juice, zest, ginger, maple syrup, port, or cinnamon. Commercial cranberry sauce may be loose and uncondensed, or condensed or jellied and sweetened with various ingredients. The jellied form may be slipped out of a can onto a dish, and served sliced or intact for slicing at the table. Cranberry sauce is often eaten in conjunction with turkey for Christmas in the United Kingdom and Canada or Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada, and it is only rarely eaten or served in other contexts there.

The atoll is formed by 105 coral reefs, representing a reef surface of 263 km2. This reef surface is 61 islands provided with vegetation, and a variable number of sandy bays (between 4 and 14). Half (38) of these islands are less than 10 hectares, constituting less than 20% of the atoll lands. The biggest island is Dharavandhoo (45,5 ha), followed by Kunfunadhoo (35 ha). The highest point, although difficult to establish, is situated in Funadhoo., with 3,19 m over the sea level. Image:Baa atoll islands.JPGSky view of a part of Baa atoll.

Biodiversity and ecology The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru. Maalhosmadulu Atoll is also considered as a good example of the rich biodiversity found in the Maldives, including large mangroves and a unique diversity of fauna, such as the benthic fauna. Furthermore, the ring- shaped reef forms known as faru in the Dhivehi language is a reef structure which is unique to the Maldives. The southernmost uninhabited island of Olhugiri in the North Maalhosmadulu Atoll lies 13 km north of Goifulhafehendhu Atoll. Olhugiri is well known for its unique natural vegetation and for providing two of the only perching sites for the great frigatebird in the Maldives. Likewise, other marine creatures such as sea turtles and hawksbill turtles can be encountered. The Fisheries Ministry of the Maldives has banned catching turtles or taking eggs from Olhugiri, which also applies to 11 other islands. One of the most-important species living around Baa Atoll is the Parrotfish. This species eats the corral under the water and secretes it later on as sand. In fact on some of the islands, 70% of the sand found there is the parrot fish's excrement.

The Maldives harbors globally-significant biodiversity in its numerous reefs and demonstrates a long history of human interaction with the environment. Covering approximately 139,700 ha of coastal/marine areas, the site is representative of the Maldives‚Äô high diversity of reef animals, with hard and soft corals, reef-associated fish species, marine turtles, Manta Rays and Whale Sharks. In addition to its 12,170 inhabitants, some 350,000 tourists visit the biosphere reserve annually. As part of a Global Environment Facility (GEF) project, the site has great potential for demonstrating sustainable development throughout the Maldives and the region, while relying on a green economy. Hanifaru Bay which is known locally as Vandhumaafaru Adi is thought to be one of the few places in the world where whale sharks congregate to mate, although recent research suggests otherwise with the vast majority of the whale sharks seen there being young males. The bay however regularly sees some of the largest gatherings of manta rays worldwide with up to one hundred individuals in the small inlet when the tide pushes plankton into the bay. The designation of Baa Atoll as a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in June 2011 was a significant achievement for the Maldives. placing it in the company of world famous sites such as Komodo island in Indonesia, Uluru (Ayer‚Äôs Rock) in Australia and the Gal√°pagos Islands.  Voavah  Voavah is the first island designated by UNESCO as an exclusive use island. The island is owned by the Four seasons company and is available for hire.

An LP of his dream diatribes - The Dream World Of Dion McGregor (He Talks In His Sleep) - was released to minor acclaim by Decca Records in 1964. A book of the same name, containing the transcripts of a wider selection of McGregor's dreams, and with illustrations by Edward Gorey, was also published in 1964. McGregor would essentially narrate his dreams at conversational volume. As a narrator of his (often terrifying) dreams, Dion adopted various personas but frequently established a fey, argumentative, insolent approach to the subject at hand - be it a hot air balloon trip to the moon with a group of multi-ethnic children, a frantic journey around New York, or a tattooing job on a woman's tongue. As a songwriter, McGregor's biggest success came when his song \\"Where Is The Wonder\\" (cowritten with roommate Michael Barr) was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her hit album My Name Is Barbra (1965). He was unable to find much success afterwards, however, and by the 1980s had given up on songwriting. Critic Joslyn Layne writes that \\"Despite his lack of success as a song lyricist, McGregor's narration of his vivid dreamlife provided a more unique artistic contribution than any usually recorded.\\"[ All Music Guide] McGregor died in 1994, but researcher Phil Milstein gathered recordings of McGregor's dream-speech considered too risque to be released in the 1960s and assembled them for the 1999 album, Dion McGregor Dreams Again, released on Tzadik Records. A third album, The Further Somniloquies of Dion McGregor: More Outrageous Recordings of the World's Most Renowned Sleeptalker was assembled by Toronto poet Steve Venright and released in August 2004 on the Torpor Vigil Industries label. A previously unreleased recording, \\"Naughty Pussy\\", was released in April 2011 as part of Awkwardcore Compilation #1 on the Awkwardcore Records label. A fourth album was released in July 2014, again assembled by Venright for Torpor Vigil, called Dreaming Like Mad with Dion McGregor: Yet More Outrageous Recordings of the World's Most Renowned Sleeptalker. He was born in New York City. Another of his roommates in the 1960s was film maker and fellow Edward Gorey enthusiast Peter de Rome. McGregor appears in de Rome's film \\"Mumbo Jumbo\\" (1971).

Although it is not legally binding under U.S. law, the ESRB rating system is a de facto standard which is self-enforced by the U.S. video game and retail industries. In some Canadian provinces, ESRB ratings are enforceable by law by local film classification boards. Games with the AO rating are considered by the board to be suitable for players age 18 and over; AO-rated games can contain higher levels of violent, profane, sexual, or pornographic content than the next-lowest rating on the scale (Mature [M], generally considered suitable for players 17 and over) can accommodate. AO is the highest of the ESRB's content ratings, and restricts the commercial availability of games which carry it; all three major video game console manufacturers (Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony) refuse to allow AO-rated games to be published for their platforms, most retailers refuse to stock AO-rated games, and the popular video game live streaming service Twitch explicitly bans all games carrying the rating. The only mainstream platform to allow AO- rated games is Steam, which hides them by default. Due to these self-imposed restrictions on the marketing and distribution of games with the rating, the AO rating has been described as a \\"kiss of death\\" by critics, and is essentially a ban. Relatively few games carry the AO-rating; the majority of AO-rated games are adult video games which received the rating for containing sexual and/or pornographic content, but the ESRB has also issued the rating for games containing extreme violence. The fighting game Thrill Kill (1998) was given an AO rating for its violent content; its release was cancelled after the acquisition of its publisher, Virgin Interactive, by Electronic Arts, as they objected to the game's content. Rockstar Games' Manhunt 2 (2007) was the second game given an AO rating for extremely violent content and the first to be released, but was re-edited to meet the M rating so it could be released on consoles (an uncut, AO-rated version for Windows was released in 2009). Hatred (2015), a game centering on a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, was the third game to receive the rating solely for violence and the second to be released. The only game to receive the rating for reasons unrelated to violence or sexual content is Peak Entertainment Casinos (2003), which received the rating as it allows the player to gamble using real money. Fellow Rockstar game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) was temporarily re-rated to AO from M in response to the release of a mod known as \\"Hot Coffee\\", which allowed players to access a sexually-explicit minigame that was removed in development, but still present within the game's code in an incomplete state. The M rating was reinstated after Rockstar released patches and revisions of the game which excluded the content entirely. San Andreas remains the only mass-released AO game. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" +AO-rated video games with details - ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Release date !scope=\\"col\\" Platform !scope=\\"col\\" Publisher !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ESRB content descriptors !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes - !scope=\\"row\\"All Nude Cyber  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1997  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Mac, Windows  rowspan=\\"3\\"  MacDaddy Entertainment  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Strong sexual content  rowspan=\\"7\\"  - !scope=\\"row\\"All Nude Glamour - !scope=\\"row\\"All Nude Nikki  1998 - !scope=\\"row\\"Body Language  1998  DVD  NuTech Digital - !scope=\\"row\\"Critical Point  2002  Windows Peach Princess  Strong sexual content, violence - !scope=\\"row\\"Crystal Fantasy  1995  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Mac, Windows  rowspan=\\"2\\"  MacDaddy Entertainment  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Strong sexual content - !scope=\\"row\\"Cyber Photographer  1996 - !scope=\\"row\\"eden* PLUS+MOSAIC   rowspan=\\"3\\" Windows rowspan=\\"2\\"  MangaGamer  Nudity, strong language, strong sexual content  This game was sent to the ESRB at the request of the Japanese developer in order to get a green-light for the release in the United States.

Named after the Tamil leader C. N. Annadurai, it is located in the north-western part of Chennai and forms a part of the Aminjikarai taluk and the Anna Nagar Zone. It is one of the prime residential areas in Chennai and is home to several prominent doctors, lawyers and politicians. Real estate prices are among the highest in the city. A recent addition to the area is VR Chennai Mall, located near Shanthi Colony and Thirumangalam junction. Anna Nagar is the first and the only township in Chennai to follow a standard addressing system followed in the western world. One of the primary landmarks in Anna Nagar is the Anna Nagar Tower, built in 1968 as part of the World Trade Fair. Other important locations include the Anna Arch, Chinthamani, Blue Star, 14 shops, Shanthi Colony, Thirumangalam junction, Padi grade separator, Anna Nagar East, and the Anna Nagar West bus depot. Anna Nagar has several established schools and colleges, places of worship, shopping areas with both independent shops and chain stores, and numerous restaurants. The 2nd avenue is an arterial road in Anna Nagar which has emerged as a hub for several restaurants and shops. There are also a number of midsize hospitals and nursing homes catering to the local population. History Anna Nagar in 1972 Anna Nagar originated as a suburban village called Naduvakkarai. It was called Mullam Village. Anna Nagar was developed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board in the early 1970s following the World Trade Fair in the area in 1968. The board developed residential plots, apartments, commercial complexes, wide roads, school zones, bus termini, and large parks. Geography As of 2018, Anna Nagar zone had a green cover of more than 20 percent, as against the city's 14.9 percent average. Culture=Chennai SangamamPlaces of worship= Anna Nagar is a secular neighbourhood with several places of worship co-existing in harmony. Several prominent temples, churches and mosques are located in Anna Nagar. Some prominent ones are: Temples: Ayyapan Temple, Chinna Tirupathi, Chandramouleswarar Temple, Arulmigu Devi Thirumani Amman Temple, Maakali Amman Temple, Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Kumarakottam Sri Balamurugan Temple, Mullai Vallabha Vinayagar Temple. Churches: Jerusalem Mar Thoma Syrian Church, CSI Emmanuel Church, St. Luke's Church, Assembly of God. Mosques: Masjid Thaqwa, Masjid-e-Jannah, Jumma Masjid, Masjid-e-Javeed. =Education= *Jaigopal Garodia Vivekananda Vidyalaya *Chennai Public School *Valliammal Matriculation Higher Secondary School *CSI Jessie Moses Matriculation Higher Secondary School Landmarks=Anna arch= A large twin arch called the Anna arch marks the entrance of the southern part of Anna Nagar on the Third Avenue, which was built in 1985 by the Corporation of Chennai at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million to commemorate the platinum jubilee celebrations of former chief minister C. N. Annadurai, when Anna Nagar was still a developing area. It was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran on 1 January 1986. Each arch stands 52 ft tall and weighs 82 tonnes. The road from the arch leads to the roundtana (roundabout) which is a major landmark and for all practical purposes, the centre of Anna Nagar. In 2012, the arch was proposed to be demolished to leave way for a flyover that was planned to connect Anna Nagar with Aminjikarai. Demolition work began on 2 September 2012. However, the alignment of the flyover was modified slightly to prevent the removal of the arch, and the arch was restored at a cost of 6.4 million. =Anna Nagar Tower= The Anna Nagar Tower is a tall tower built for the 1968 World Trade Fair, by B. S. Abdur Rahman. Its main entrance is from the 3rd Main Road and a back entrance from the 6th main road. It is popular with morning walkers and joggers, and with families and young people in the evenings to play and relax. For a nominal fee, one could walk to the top of the tower from where excellent views of the city could be seen. Entry inside the tower has been stopped for the last few years due to safety concerns as there had been a few cases of suicide in the past. The tower and park are now renovated and has a skating rink. Currently, it boasts of a good turnout of children who come in for practising their skills on roller skates. There is also a group of regulars who practice silambattam - an ancient Tamil martial art form - here. From atop the tower one can have a panoramic views, and the rapidly changing skyline of the city can be appreciated. Transport=Road= Anna Nagar has two bus termini, Anna Nagar West and Anna Nagar East. The East terminus is located near Anna Nagar Roundtana while the West terminus is situated on the Inner Ring Road. The West terminus is one of the largest bus terminuses in the city. Buses to different parts of the city beginning from the West Terminus. The roads in Anna Nagar are designed based on a matrix structure similar to roads in developed countries in the western world; all the roads are laid parallel and perpendicular to each other. In addition, a standardized naming nomenclature is adopted. In Anna Nagar, 2nd, 4th and 6th Avenues run east‚Äìwest and 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th Avenues run North South. All the streets are interconnected to these avenues. Areas expanded after the formation of the initial 1970 layouts do not follow the standard nomenclature. Anna Nagar Roundtana The Anna Nagar Roundtana located at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue is a sprawling and burgeoning high-scale commercial neighborhood. This was initially developed for the Madras EXPO during the 1970s and was named \\"Round Turn Over\\", whose name has colloquially changed to \\"Roundtana\\" with the use of Tamil Language. It has a wide variety of markets and showrooms in the vicinity such as Croma, Tanishq, Bata, etc. and thus is a very important landmark for shoppers. =Railway= The Anna Nagar railway station was inaugurated in the year 2003. It is located on the Thirumangalam road, a road that connects Anna Nagar West with Villivakkam. The railway line stretches for 3.09 kilometers and links Anna Nagar with the Tiruvallur-Chennai suburban line. Between 2003 and 2007, five suburban trains were operated from Anna Nagar to Chennai Beach via Villivakkam. The station was closed in 2007 for the construction of the Padi elevated rotary. However, after the completion of the rotary in 2009, the station remained closed owing to its low patronage. There were plans to reopen the station in 2011. None of them materialised, however. Three underground metro stations, two in Anna Nagar and one in Anna Nagar East, which form a part of the phase 1 metro project Politics Anna Nagar (State Assembly Constituency) is part of Chennai Central (Lok Sabha constituency).

Madame Fatal was created and originally illustrated by artist/writer Art Pinajian and the debut of the character was in the Crack Comics #1 (May 1940), a crime/detective anthology series published by Quality Comics. Madame Fatal continued as a feature in that title but when the character was not well received, Madame Fatal made a last appearance in #22 (March 1942). The character later appeared in some publications by DC Comics when DC Comics bought the rights to the character in 1956, along with a bulk buy of all Quality Comic's characters, although Madame Fatal not been seen much since except a few brief appearances and passing mentions by other comic book characters. Madame Fatal is notable for being a male superhero who dressed up as an elderly woman and as such is the first cross-dressing hero. The original incarnation of the Red Tornado would become the first cross-dressing heroine later that year. Fictional character biography \\"She\\" was actually Richard Stanton, a handsome, pipe-smoking, dapper, middle-aged blonde Caucasian man who is exceptionally intelligent and intuitive, as well as being at the peak of his physical abilities. He had made a vast fortune successfully playing the Wall Street stock market of the late 1920s, a time of economic unrest, which incurred the jealousy of many of those close to him. In his private life, Stanton was also a widower and a single father, being the parent of a two- year-old (unnamed) girl. As well as being a successful financial investor, Stanton is also a lover of theatrics and a world-famous stage, theatre, radio and film actor living in Manhattan, until his wealthy and prominent celebrity status brought unwanted attention from costumed villains. Stanton's daughter was kidnapped by them and the police were unable to uncover their identities, but Stanton was, on his wits and superior investigative skills. As such, Stanton decided to take matters into his own hands after he deduced that the leader of the gang was John Carver, a crime kingpin who had been running extortion rackets in various cities. As a civilian, Stanton had already been searching for Carver for eight years, after a fight they had and the threats that Carver had made. Prior to this, Carver had been the first man to love Stanton's late wife, and Carver had been jilted when she chose Stanton instead. After the kidnapping of Stanton's daughter, and when the police got nowhere, Stanton's wife was riddled with guilt as it was her previous connection with Carver which had brought about the whole scenario. She died of a broken heart. Stanton was able to infiltrate the John Carver gang due to his convincing acting and stage disguise as an old, helpless, red-cloaked woman with a yellow walking cane which doubled as a sly quarterstaff. Once inside their lair Stanton then used his natural athleticism and physical abilities to wipe out the unsuspecting gang, and revealed his true identity to Carver. In the ensuing fight, Carver (a formidable fighter himself) knocked Stanton to the ground and attempted to shoot him with a revolver, but Stanton quickly pulled out a rug from underneath Carver, tripping him up, and Carver accidentally shot himself instead. In his dying breaths, the crime kingpin told Stanton his daughter was still alive, although held captive by another villain. He never revealed who before dying. Stanton decided to retire from acting and continue down the path of a crime-fighter and bring other villains to justice, inspired by his first success, adopting the alter-ego Madame Fatal. Stanton made his last appearance on Broadway on May 1, 1930, as an old woman, which garnered Stanton praise and acclaim from the audience. After that he disappeared from public view altogether and became \\"Madame Fatal\\" full- time. Stanton would also use the alternate identity to attempt to locate his captive daughter, whom Carver had passed on to other villains. When the character rights were sold to DC Comics and DC decided not to continue the character, this plot point was not resolved contemporaneously, and it was not revealed which villain was actually holding Stanton's daughter until The Shade #4 in 2012. The old woman disguise was aided strongly by his expert acting skills, being a former professional actor and female impersonator. This same disguise also often raised Stanton above suspicion, and made him an expert in confidence trickery, infiltration, stealth, information gathering, and melting anonymously into crowds. Madame Fatal was also aided on occasion by his pet parrot, Hamlet, his only connection to his previous life. Hamlet was named so because he was intelligent enough to recite Shakespeare, and would inspire and help Stanton remember important information. Powers and abilities Although Stanton had no actual super powers to speak of, he was a strong, agile and athletic man at his physical peak and a skilled fighter with a powerful punch. He had a high level of intelligence and intuition which aided his investigative abilities and locating criminals. Madame Fatal often came up against criminal masterminds and supervillains such as Doctor Prowl (a black- masked, hat-wearing gentlemanly murderer with metal claws) and the Jester (a violent clown-themed thief who laughs at death) and their henchmen. However, Madame Fatal's disguise gave him an edge in physical combat as his foes would underestimate his strength and speed. Madame Fatal's yellow walking cane was also a formidable weapon in Stanton's hands as he was adept at using the cane as a weapon. Controversy and ridicule Madame Fatal was never a popular character given the cross-dressing angle, which is perhaps part of the reason why DC Comics decided not to further run with the character and limited him to light-hearted jibes made by other comic book heroes. The character has often been ridiculed, such as in an article on Cracked.com which listed the character as one of the \\"7 crappiest super heroes in comic book history\\". Madame Fatal at DC Comics DC Comics acquired the rights to all the former Quality Comics characters in 1956, but Madame Fatal has rarely surfaced. Outside of regular DC Universe continuity, comix writer Kim Deitch (Hollywoodland) did a story in 1972 that purported to be about Madame Fatal. James Robinson and Paul Smith featured Madame Fatal in a cameo in 1993's The Golden Age #4. The character appears in a panel surrounded by the Fiddler, and the Gambler, who all appear to be courting the cross-dressing hero while other characters (including Wildfire, Harlequin, and the Psycho-Pirate) stand around giggling (apparently knowing Madame Fatal's true gender). In a scene in JSA #1 (Aug. 1999) depicting the funeral of the first Sandman, Wildcat wonders whether his own funeral will \\"be like the time they buried Madame Fatal here, and no one turned up for the funeral but the touring cast of La Cage aux Folles?\\" James Robinson gives the character a prominent role in The Shade #4 (2012), set in 1944. In this issue Madame Fatal finally learns the location of his daughter.

Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means \\"river neighbor\\", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor). Morphology Potamogeton species range from large (stems of 6 m or more) to very small (less than 10 cm). Height is strongly influenced by environmental conditions, particularly water depth. All species are technically perennial, but some species disintegrate in autumn to a large number of asexually produced resting buds called turions, which serve both as a means of overwintering and dispersal. Turions may be borne on the rhizome, on the stem, or on stolons from the rhizome. Most species, however, persist by perennial creeping rhizomes. In some cases the turions are the only means to differentiate species. The leaves are alternate, which contrasts with the closely related genus Groenlandia, where the leaves are opposite or whorled. In many species, all the leaves are submerged, and in these cases, they are typically thin and translucent. Some species, especially in ponds and very slow-moving waters, have floating leaves which tend to be opaque with a leathery texture. Leaf shape has been found to be highly plastic, with variability due to changes in light, water chemistry, planting depth, sediment conditions, temperature, photo period, waves, and seasonality. All Potamogeton have a delicate membranous sheathing scale, the stipule, at the leaf axil. This may be wholly attached, partly attached, or free of the leaf, and it may have inrolled margins or appear as a tube. The morphology of the stipule is an important character for species identification. The stems have small scales. The flowers, which are often overlooked, are greenish-brown and are composed of four rounded segments borne in a spike. They are 2-4 merous, with superior ovaries and anthers that turn outward. The fruits are spheroidal and green to brown, usually 1‚Äì3 mm in diameter, with a noticeable 'beak'. Their pollen is inaperturate, monad, apolar and spherical. Most fine- leaved pondweeds are diploid, with 2n = 26 (such as P. pusillus or P. trichoides) or less commonly 28 (P. compressus, P. acutifolius). Broad-leaved taxa are mainly tetraploid, with 2n = 52 (e.g. P. alpinus, P. praelongus), but a few species are diploid (e.g. P. coloratus or octaploid (2n = 104)(e.g. P. illinoensis). Taxonomy Potamogeton is a genus of freshwater aquatic plants in the Potamogetonaceae. Molecular analysis has identified Groenlandia as the sister group to Potamogeton, although the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group also lists Zannichellia, Althenia and Pseudoalthenia as closely related genera. Some researchers have used molecular analysis and pollen grain shape to argue for the placement of Stuckenia at the genus level, but others have argued there is not enough difference to justify the change, and have kept Stuckenia as a subgenus of Potamogeton. The genus is generally divided into two groups: broad-leaved and linear-leaved. The broad-leaved group includes such species as P. natans, P. perfoliatus and P. alpinus. The linear-leaved group includes such species as P. rutilus, P. compressus and P. berchtoldii. Series Batrachoseris historically contained only one species, Potamogeton crispus, however more recent research has also added P. maackianus and P. robbinsii into this grouping. These general divisions have been supported by molecular analysis, except that P. crispus clusters with broad-leaved species in section Potamogeton. In a detailed review of the genus, Wiegleb and Kaplan recognised 69 species, but the variability of many species means that there is disagreement regarding the exact number of species. Currently, the number of accepted names is 94. Hybridisation provides an added complexity to the taxonomy. Distribution Potamogeton species are found worldwide in many aquatic ecosystems. However, the greatest diversity of species occurs in the northern hemisphere, especially in North America, which is thought to be where the genus originated. Molecular evidence suggests that several independent colonizations of the southern hemisphere have occurred. However, due to their self-propagation from turions, Potamogeton populations show very low infrapopulation diversity, especially when living in deep, shaded or turbulent water where colonies do not expend energy on flowers. This has made it very difficult to use genetic data to find patterns of geographical differentiation. Potamegeton coloratus from a peat bog in Konkan Maharashtra State of India Hybrids Potamogeton species hybridise freely. At least 27 hybrids have been observed in the British Isles alone, and more than 50 worldwide, of which 36 have been confirmed using genetic techniques. The majority of these are sterile, but many are long-lived and may occur in the absence of one or even both parents. Most hybrids have been described between broad-leaved species, but this probably reflects the relative scarcity of characters among fine-leaved taxa, so that hybrids are much more difficult to identify. Use of genetic markers suggests that hybrid taxa are also reasonably frequent among fine-leaved species. At least one species, P. obtusifolius, is thought to have arisen via hybridisation. Taxonomic history Several species of European pondweeds, including P. natans, P. lucens and P. crispus, were included in Linnaeus's Species Plantarum in 1753. Much of the European Potamogeton flora was subsequently named during the late 18th and early 19th century. As botanists ventured further afield, pondweeds began to be collected and named from other parts of the world. The North America flora was largely named by the start of the 20th century. Alfred Fryer became interested in Potamogeton in the 1880s, and was a recognised authority on the genus. The first parts of his work The Potamogetons (Pond Weeds) of the British Isles were published in 1898. His death intervened, and the work was completed by Arthur Bennett (1843-1929), who named a large number of specimens sent to him from around the world. Robert Morgan (1863-1900) illustrated Fryer's contribution to the monograph, his colour plates drawing praise from later critics. In 1916, Johan Hagstr√∂m published Critical researches on the Potamogetons from detailed measurements of dozens of vegetative, anatomical and reproductive characteristics such as fruit beak, peduncle rigidity and leaf apex across hundreds of specimens. It was a pioneering work that preceded the development of cladistics by more than 30 years, and his clustering of groups into broad-leaf and linear-leaf is still considered the framework for all subsequent classification systems of Potamogeton. Hagstr√∂m's work was developed further by Merritt Fernald (1873-1950) who created a detailed phylogeny for the linear-leaved species, and by Eugene Ogden who did so for the broad-leaved species. New species continue to be described from less well- studied areas such as Asia and Africa, and it is possible that molecular analysis may reveal hitherto unknown cryptic species. =List of Potamogeton species= The following list is based on the latest listing of valid Potamogeton taxa held on The Plant List. *P. acutifolius Link ex Roem. & Schult. 1818 *P. alpinus Balb. 1804 *P. amplifolius Tuck. 1848 *P. antaicus Hagstr. 1916 *P. australiensis A.Benn. 1910 *P. berchtoldii Fieber 1838 *P. bicupulatus Fernald 1932 *P. biformis Hagstr. 1916 *P. brasiliensis A.Benn. 1910 *P. chamissoi A.Benn. 1904 *P. cheesemanii A.Benn. 1883 *P. chongyangensis W.X.Wang 1984 *P. coloratus Hornem. 1813 *P. compressus L. 1753 *P. confervoides Rchb. 1845 *P. crispus L. 1753 *P. cristatus Regel & Maack, 1861 *P. delavayi A.Benn. 1892 *P. distinctus A.

The fruits may be produced in large quantities from midsumer onwards, and are ingested by waterfowl. Germination experiments have shown that the seeds are viable after passing through the digestive tracts of birds and this mechanism is probably the only natural mechanism for long-distance dispersal between isolated water bodies. Vegetative propagation occurs by a variety of mechanisms including turions, and via growth and fragmentation of rhizomes and shoots. Vegetative reproduction is evidently an effective means of ensuring local persistence, as sterile hybrids have been recorded at some sites for over 100 years. Although they occur in a range of environments, most species prefer standing or slow-flowing waters with some calcium and fairly low nutrient levels. In general the fine-leaved species are more tolerant of human impacts such as eutrophication. They are important as food and habitat for animals including insect larvae, water snails, ducks and other waterfowl, and aquatic mammals such as beavers. Most species are not weedy, but a few can become troublesome, such as curly-leaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus). In relation to the ecosystem as a whole, Potamogeton is often a common habitat for insects. For example, C. annularius and other insects from the Chironomus genera have been found to inhabit and mate around certain species of Potamogeton. The closeness to a fresh water source as well as cover from predators allows C. annularius to thrive.

Mount Gilo) is an Israeli settlement organized as a community settlement located about five kilometers south of Jerusalem, and two kilometers west of Bethlehem in the northern Judean hills of the West Bank. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two Palestinian villages/towns in order to construct Har Gilo: *92 dunams from al-Walaja,Al Walaja Village Profile, p. 16 *the remaining, totaling 271 dunams, from Beit JalaBeit Jala City Profile ARIJ pp. 23-24 Due to Har Gilo's strategic location, the Turkish, British and Jordanian armies all had bases there. An Israel Defense Forces base was established after the Six-Day War in June 1967. The civilian settlement of Har Gilo was established on Hanukkah 1968. It is named after the biblical Gilo (Joshua 15:51) in the mountains of the Tribe of Juda. It is considered part of Gush Etzion. In 2007, Har Gilo had a population of 462. According to Peace Now, Har Gilo breaks the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state and its close proximity to Al Walaja and Beit Jala will make it difficult to include within Israel's final boundaries. The settlement lies within the Israeli West Bank barrier, constructed in the early 2000s, which passes just outside the settlement, separating it from the neighbouring villages. Status under international law Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Har Gilo is considered illegal under international law, though Israeli disputes this. The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

It was closed down by the British authorities for violating contemporary standards of obscenity. Publication The Pearl ran for eighteen issues from July 1879 to December 1880, with two Christmas supplements. As an underground publication, it was limited to 150 copies and cost twenty-five pounds, which made it unusually expensive relative to comparable contemporaneous pornographic periodicals. The Christmas Annual, a crudely produced supplement that ran sixty pages, sold for three guineas. Only the special numbers contained illustrations. The publisher and editor, William Lazenby, also wrote some of the content.Donald Thomas, A Long Time Burning (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), 276. The magazine was distributed discreetly through mail order.Lisa Z. Sigel, Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914 (New Brunswick: Rutgers University press, 2002), 8. Based on the cost and subject matter, the target audience appears to have been middle- and upper-class professionals.Rachel Potter, \\"Obscene Modernism and the Trade in Salacious Books,\\" Modernism/modernity 16.1 (2009): 96. Two of the flagellant poems were composed by Algernon Charles Swinburne, though it is unclear whether he authorized their publication.Donald Thomas, Swinburne: The Poet in His world (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979), 216. The format of the magazine, in combining a mix of short stories, serial fiction, current events, and letters to the editor, parodied contemporary family magazines such as Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, which itself contained depictions of corporal punishment.Sharon Marcus, Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), 140 Parts of the magazine were later compiled and translated into German. After the magazine was shut down, Lazenby would go on to publish three subsequent pornographic magazines, The Cremorne (1882), The Oyster (1883), and The Boudoir (1883). The popularity of pornographic magazines like The Pearl was part of a trend that began in the 1860s of capitalizing on the profitability of writing about sex, which served to proliferate discourses about sexuality by the time of the fin de si√®cle in England.Tanya Pikula, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula and Late-Victorian Advertising Tactics: Earnest Men, Virtuous Ladies, and Porn,\\" English Literature in Transition 55.3 (2012): 287. Contents The general format of the periodical was to publish three serial erotic tales simultaneously, devoted to sex in high society, incest, and flagellation, respectively. The novels, six in total, were interspersed with limericks, hymns, odes, songs, facetious nursery rhymes, acrostic poems, parodies, faux advertisements, and fabricated letters to the editor. The topics depicted in the novels and poems were wide-ranging, including women's suffrage, physical disability, sexual impairment, secret sex societies, bestiality, India-rubber dildos, slave rape, duels, mock crucifixions, Turkish harems, and prophylactic devices.Thomas J. Joudrey, \\"Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad,\\" Victorian Poetry 54.4 (2017). The Pearl often contained extensive political commentary, including references to the Reform Bills and Contagious Diseases Acts, and portrayed or alluded to many controversial public figures, including Annie Besant, Charles Spurgeon, Wilfrid Lawson, Newman Hall, Edmund Burke, William Gladstone, and Robert Peel. The Pearl contains the first obscene tale about slavery in the Americas. The story, entitled My Grandmother's Tale, depicts the brutal sexualized flogging of a black West Indian slave girl by an overseer of ambiguous racial background acting under the authority of a white plantation owner.Colette Colligan, The Traffic in Obscenity from Byron to Beardsley (New York: Palgrave, 2006), 106. The Pearl's serial novel Lady Pokingham, in which a consumptive invalid recounts her sexual adventures from a wheelchair, has been noted for its depiction of transience, bodily decay, and death, which thus provides counter-evidence to the idea advanced by Steven Marcus that Victorian pornography portrays a pornotopia.Thomas J. Joudrey, \\"Penetrating Boundaries: An Ethics of Anti- Perfectionism in Victorian Pornography,\\" Victorian Studies 57.3 (2015): 426. Legal and Cultural Legacy Swinburne‚Äôs flagellant writings from The Pearl have been cited in British legal arguments as evidence against the safety and utility of corporal punishment in schools.Frank Bates, \\"Corporal Punishment in Legal, Historical and Social Context,\\" Manitoba Law Journal 12 (1982-1983), 337. In 2011 an Australian alderman was convicted for possession of \\"child exploitation material\\" because a digital copy of The Pearl was found on his laptop. Greg Barns, the director of Australian Lawyers Alliance, noted that the conviction would imply criminality for possession of any number of works of art and literature, and media reports pointed out that Harper Collins had republished the magazine in 2009, and was currently available on Amazon.\\"Tasmanian Alderman David Traynor Gets Child Porn Conviction for Book Still Sold in Australia,\\" The Courier Mail, March 2, 2011. When the Victorian origins of the materials were identified on appeal, the conviction was set aside. A selection from the story Lady Pokingham is read during a scene in the 2012 film The Master. The Pearls characters and venues, being Victoriana, are featured in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore. A girls' school seems to be haunted by a ghost (The \\"Holy Spirit\\") that is raping and impregnating the students. The headmistress is Rosa Coote, a character from one of The Pearl's serials.

The Boeing 737-200 was flying from Hilo, Hawaii to Honolulu, Hawaii, when it experienced rapid decompression when a section of the fuselage was torn away.Russell and Lee 2005, p. 70. With one flight attendant blown from the cabin to her death and 65 others injured, the aircraft was able to make a successful emergency landing at Kahului Airport, on Maui. Miracle Landing stars Connie Sellecca, Wayne Rogers, Ana Alicia and Nancy Kwan. The film aired February 11, 1990 on CBS and has since been shown in syndication on network broadcasts throughout the world. Plot In February 1988, two pilots in a flight simulator face the challenge of landing a crippled jet that experiences a cabin decompression, an engine fire and a loss of hydraulics. The three simulated emergencies foreshadow the events of Paradise Airlines Flight 243, taking place two months later. Three crew members: Madeleine \\"Mimi\\" Tompkins (Connie Sellecca), Captain Robert \\"Bob\\" Schornstheimer (Wayne Rogers) and Flight Attendant Michelle Honda (Ana Alicia) are flying together on Paradise Airlines Flight 243. First Officer pilot Tompkins has been selected for training to become a full Captain in the airline, having been the first female pilot to be hired by Paradise in 1979. Paradise Airlines 243 is an inter-island flight from Honolulu to Hilo, with a return to Honolulu the same day. The flight takes off over Hilo, and soon beverage service begins. During that time, nothing out of the ordinary occurs, but soon after, David Kornberg (Will Estes), a young boy travelling with his mother (Jane Daly), calls the lead flight attendant, C.B. Lansing (Nancy Kwan) and asks her about the crack appearing in the ceiling. At that moment, chaos breaks loose and the entire front and top half section of the airliner, apart from the cockpit and cargo hold, blows off in a clean separation. In the chaos, Michelle falls to the floor and clings to a passenger's seat, C.B. is blown from the aircraft off-screen, and passengers are badly injured from debris and decompression. The third flight attendant Jane Sato-Tomita (Patty Toy) is thrown to the cabin floor and sustains serious head injuries, clinging to other passengers to avoid the same fate as C.B. The cockpit crew is unaware of the full scale of the disaster and believe a bomb or decompression has occurred. Soon passengers seated in the section that was not swept away have oxygen masks fall but it is useless as all the lines were destroyed. However, the aircraft was at a low altitude thus it had not affected them as badly. Mimi and Bob contact Kahului Airport to declare an emergency. Soon, the pilots are faced with the fact they may crash and passengers would die, and both Mimi and Bob have flashbacks to her training days and his US Air Force times, respectively. Michelle has a flashback to walking the shoreline with her father who as a soldier in the Army, has died. Jane's injuries worsen and Michelle struggles to climb to her and help her. Later, she also feels she might lose it from the chaos and picks up the call phone only to find it dead. Dorothy Hendricks (Herta Ware) leans out of the airliner and appears to have a state of shock before her husband George (Jack Murdock) notices and pulls her back inside. Michelle then begins to instruct the passengers on a possible crash landing or water landing and passes out life jackets. Gail Kornberg becomes hysterical when she cannot get a life jacket for David, but soon is calmed by Michelle. Roy Wesler (Glenn Cannon) panics when he sees hydraulic fluid leaking from the wings. The tower alerts Kahului Fire and Rescue personnel and they arrive before the crippled jet lands. Finally after several tense minutes, Mimi and Bob are able to figure out a plan for the emergency. After some time, the airliner lands but with difficulties in the brakes and hydraulics. The pilots were worried that the landing might result in a broken aircraft and fire, but miraculously their landing resulted in no deaths and the emergency notification allowed crews to treat and evacuate passengers immediately.

The aircraft used for the movie bearing the colors of the fictitious Paradise Airlines, is a Boeing 737-297CT (Advanced), registered as N70723. At the time, it was owned by Aloha Airlines, the airline involved in the Flight 243 incident. That aircraft was used by WestJet Airlines in Canada until 2002 (re- registered as C-GCWJ). Reception Miracle Landing was considered an authentic and accurate portrayal of the Aloha Airlines Flight 243. In his later review, Sergio Ortega said: \\"Miracle Landing is one of the most technically accurate air disaster movies ever.\\" Miracle Landing won the 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects.

In Mercury, the goal is to guide a drop of mercury to its appointed destination by tilting the stage, in a similar fashion to Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball. Levels come in different varieties that prioritize different methods of completing each level. The game was conceived when Archer Maclean used a previous minigame from Jimmy White's Cueball World and added a liquid metal physics. It was originally designed to have motion controls by using a tilt sensor peripheral for the PSP but was never released due to technical constraints. Mercury was released in North America on April 6, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005. The game had received positive reception for its original concept and level designs but had received mixed reception for its difficulty. The game's success led to receiving two sequels. The first, titled Mercury Meltdown, was released for PSP, then revised and ported onto PlayStation 2 and Wii. The second sequel, titled Mercury Hg, was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Gameplay Gameplay of one of Mercurys Task levels. The droplet of mercury can be manipulated to be split into two, change into different colors and merged to create a new color. Mercury is a puzzle video game that takes on similar gameplay to that of Marble Madness. The player can manipulate a droplet of mercury to move in the player's desire direction by tilting the stage using the PSP's analog stick. The player can use the directional buttons to toggle between focusing on all mercury droplets or a single droplet. The objective of each level in the game is to navigate the mercury around the stage and reach the goal. The HUD is made up of a time limit, a mercury level gauge, and a beacon count. To clear a level, all beacons on the level must be activated within that level's time and mercury limit. If the amount of Mercury on the level drops below the limit or time runs out, the level ends and must be restarted. Each stage has hazards and obstacles designed to reduce the player's amount of mercury. The mercury can also be split into separate parts by using sharp objects or other hazards in the stage. Paint Shops are floating devices that change the color of the mercury once the mercury is under it. Some switches and doors only activate if interacting with mercury of a specific color. If the mercury is split up, the two droplets can be colored differently; if the two then merge, they form a new color. Color mixing is based on the RGB color model. For example, a red droplet and a green droplet can be merged to form a yellow one. There is a total of six worlds. Each world is split into three Race levels, three Percentage levels, three Task levels, two Combo levels, and a final boss level. Race levels prioritize completing the level as fast as possible more than mercury count. Percentage levels emphasize preserving Mercury over quick completion. Task levels will have 1 to 6 beacons that must be activated to clear the level. Combo levels are either a combination of Race and Percentage levels or a combination of Percentage and Task levels. There are is each type of combo level in each world available before the boss. Boss levels are a combination of Race, Percentage, and Task. They are the last levels in each world and completing them will result in unlocking the next available world. If the highest score is achieved in all levels of one particular world, a bonus 13th level is unlocked. After all bonus levels are discovered for each world and also achieve the highest scores, a secret 7th world is unlocked. Development and release Mercury was developed by Awesome Studios with Archer Maclean as the lead designer for the game. The game was inspired by tilting puzzle games similar to Super Monkey Ball and Marble Madness. The game was conceived when Archer Maclean used one of the minigames from Jimmy White's Cueball World and implemented a \\"liquid metal physics\\" prototype engine. Archer Maclean chose to study the physics of mercury by obtaining a bottle of real mercury taken from barometers. During development, one of the challenges Awesome Studios had was emulating real mercury physics, how the mercury would split and merge. When Awesome Studios was in the play-testing stage of development, the developers noticed potential shortcuts the player can use in the level layouts and adjusted the level design to allow more of them. The game was originally advertised to be released with a tilt sensor peripheral in order to use motion controls, however was unable to be implemented due to cost and technical issues. Archer Maclean chose to release the game on PSP as it could make the game more noticeable for consumers. This led the game to have a tight production schedule to match the launch of the PlayStation Portable, causing the developers to cut corners in the production and resulted in the game to not be as refined as Awesome Studios intended it to be. Mercury was published by Ignition Entertainment and released in North America on April 6, 2005. The game was distributed by Atari for the European version and was released in Europe on September 1, 2005 as a launch title for the PSP. A limited edition bundle was released with its sequel, Mercury Meltdown on October 19, 2010. Reception Mercury was received well among critics. The game has an aggregated score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 39 reviews. Common praises for the game was in regards to its level design and physics. Eurogamer writer praised the level designs, calling them \\"ingenious\\". IGN was impressed with the number of levels and the variety between the different designs. GameSpot writer, in particular, gave compliments towards the physics of the mercury on how it can be stretched, reassemble and squeeze together.\\" GamesTM gave praise to both the physics and level design of the game, stating, \\"Mercury's subtle combination of spot-on physics, obvious answers and hidden shortcuts creates a game of continual perfection and frustration alike.\\" GameSpy, however, gave a lukewarm response to the level design, stating the best ones are clever and addicting but the worst ones make the player jump through too many hoops. Pocket Gamer made comparisons to the Lumines series stating, \\"Lumines is more fun to play, but Mercury is more satisfying to beat.\\" In regards to the difficulty, the game had mixed reception. GamesTM stated, \\"If the PSP wasn't so fragile, we'd have thrown it on the floor because of Mercurys difficulty.\\" PALGN made noted the difficulty of the game can scale to \\"ridiculous levels\\" but defended it by assuring that it doesn't feel impossible.\\" GameSpot noted that the game wasn't impossible even at its most difficult, however, criticized the difficulty pacing, stating \\"The game pretty much throws you off the deep end almost immediately after you've completed the idiotically simple tutorial.\\" Edge, however, praised the difficulty, stating, \\"Mercury exhibits a perfect hierarchy of challenge and reward, the two remaining poised throughout and ultimately growing to the point where they touch and become one. The pain becomes the pleasure because, in spite of the extraordinary degree of trial and, there's never a moment that feels broken or exploitative.\\" Sequels Archer Maclean's Mercury inspired two sequels for the game. The first sequel, titled Mercury Meltdown, was released PSP. The game features new puzzles and modes, as well as a more vibrant and cartoon-like style of graphics. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 titled Mercury Meltdown Remix and to the Wii called Mercury Meltdown Revolution. A second sequel titled, Mercury Hg, was developed by Eiconic Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game adds in 60 new levels, an online leaderboard, and a music feature that allows the mercury blob and stage to pulsate to the player's music. The game was announced in E3 2011. Eiconic chose to go back to the core elements of the original and added a style in which the developers described as \\"clean and stylish\\". Ignition Entertainment released the game on September 28, 2011. The game also features ghost racing, the ability to share replays, and Sixaxis tilt controls for the PlayStation 3 version. Two downloadable content (DLC) packages were released for the game. The first DLC titled \\"Heavy Elements\\" was released on October 19, 2011, and contains thirty discovery mode levels, ten bonus levels, and five challenges levels. The second DLC titled \\"Rare Earth Elements\\" was released on November 29, 2011, and contains the same amount of content as the previous. Mercury Hg received an aggregated score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews.

Linda Schele (October 30, 1942 ‚Äì April 18, 1998) was an expert in the field of Maya epigraphy and iconography. She played an invaluable role in the decipherment of much of the Maya hieroglyphs. She produced a massive volume of drawings of stelae and inscriptions, which, following her wishes, are free for use to scholars. In 1978, she founded the annual Maya Meetings at The University of Texas at Austin. She was from Hendersonville, TN, a northern suburb of Nashville. Her mother Ruby Richmond was active in historic preservation at Historic Rock Castle in the 1980s. Early life  Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Linda Schele began taking commercial art courses at the University of Cincinnati in 1960 and graduated in Education and Art in 1964. With an increasing interest in literature, she spent another four years in Cincinnati's graduate program and obtained her master's degree in Art in 1968. She married the architect David Schele in 1968, and started teaching Studio Art at the University of South Alabama, remaining there till 1980, by which time she was Professor.Coe 2000:133 Work In 1970 she traveled with her husband, David Schele, to photograph Mesoamerican monuments in Yucat√°n on behalf of the University. An obligatory visit to Palenque the next summer turned into a 12-day stay spent drawing and studying Maya architecture after she was fascinated by the art. She decided to investigate the culture and history of the ancient people who had created the city.Stone 2002:13 Mentored by Merle Greene Robertson, Schele worked with Peter Mathews to decipher a major section of the list of Palenque kings, presenting her work in the 1973 conference Mesa Redonda de Palenque, organized by Robertson. This meeting established the previously unknown Linda as a major figure in the Maya studies, not only of art and history, but also of dirt archaeology and epigraphy,Coe 2000:133 and her work stimulated several later discoveries, by herself and others. In 1975, Schele was invited to the Second International Archaeoastronomy Conference at Colgate to present an exploratory paper on Palenque hierophanies and their link to emblem and skull variant glyphs, which she later published in 1977.Stone 2002:14 A strong supporter of collaborative scholarship, Schele became a Fellow in pre-Columbian Studies at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C. in 1975. Alongside Peter Mathews; David Kelley; and one of her longtime mentors, Floyd Lousbury, she participated in a series of miniconferences at Dumbarton Oaks which pushed further developing and refining of the Palenque series and also opened new epigraphic frontiers.Coe 2000:133 She focused on the study of word ordering in Maya inscriptions for the next two years there. Still attending graduate school, Schele founded the Maya Hieroglyphic Workshop in Texas in 1977 which consisted of 21 consecutive seminars concerning Maya hieroglyphic writing and introduced more people intrigued by the Maya field than many other books from that time that were considered \\"popular\\".Coe 2000:133 Twenty years later, the workshop expanded into what is known as the Maya Meetings at Texas, and includes a symposium of research papers by major scholars and the Forum on Hieroglyphic Writing. By this time in her life, Schele realized her destiny as a Mayanist; she enrolled as a graduate student in Latin American Studies at the University of Texas shortly before resigning from her position at South Alabama.Coe 2000:133 She was awarded a Doctorate in Latin American studies by the University of Texas in 1980. She continued her teaching career there, in the department of Art/Art History. At the time of her death, she was the John D. Murchison Regents Professor of Art in the department. Schele joined the Cop√°n Mosaics Project in the mid 1980s, working with David Stuart, Barbara Fash, and Nikolai Grube on the texts of that site. In 1986, Schele and Stuart identified Copan‚Äôs dynastic founder, K‚Äôinich Yax K‚Äôuk‚Äô Mo‚Äô.Sharer & Traxler 2006:146 Shortly after, she began a related series called the Cop√°n Notes, reports on epigraphy and iconography, which were aimed at rapid dissemination of information amongst Maya scholars. In 1986, Schele co-curated a ground breaking exhibition and catalog of Maya art, \\"The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art\\", with Mary Miller, a project initiated by InterCultura and the Kimbell Art Museum, where it opened in 1986, and the two co-authored the catalog to the exhibition, which was published under the title \\"The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art\\". The exhibition spoke of an obsession with royal descent, of incessant warfare, and of bloody sacrifice and self-mutilation which was inconsistent with the models proposed by previous generations of Mayanists. According to Michael D. Coe, the catalog presented by Schele and Miller \\"might as well stand as the most influential book on the Maya published in the past half-century.\\" Coe 2000:134 She also began taking an interest in the culture of the contemporary Maya. For a decade beginning 1988, she organized 13 workshops, along with Nikolai Grube and Frederico Fahsen, on hieroglyphic writing for them in Guatemala and Mexico. Michael D. Coe claims that \\"Linda's most important contribution to Maya scholarship\\" is represented in her book Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path published in 1993 with David Freidel and Joy Parker.Coe 2000:134 Death On April 18, 1998, she died of pancreatic cancer, aged fifty-five. Upon being diagnosed with this disease, Schele planned ahead knowing she would not have long to live and resumed her lectures until a few days before her passing.Coe 2000:135 Just before her death, she established the Linda Schele Precolumbian Endowment, which provides financial support for the Linda and David Schele Chair in Mesoamerican Art and Writing at UT Austin. Recognition Her doctoral dissertation, \\"Maya Glyphs: the Verbs\\" was published in 1982 and won \\"The Most Creative and Innovative Project in Professional and Scholarly Publication\\" an award given by the Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers. The Blood of Kings was awarded the Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award of the College Art Association for the best exhibition catalogue of 1986. She was awarded diplomas of recognition of the Museo Popol Vuh and the Universidad Francisco Marroquin by the government of Guatemala in March 1998. Texas Notes The Texas Notes were informal reports produced by Linda Schele and others between 1990 and 1997 to allow for the quick dissemination of results in the rapidly evolving field of Maya epigraphy.

Instructions for constructing an EPR appear in chapter 3 of Air Force Instruction 36-2406: Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems. The EPR replaced the Airman Performance Report (APR) in the late 1980s. The USAF commissioned officer equivalent is the Officer Performance Report (OPR). The United States Navy equivalent is the Fitness Report (FITREP). The United States Army equivalent is the Enlisted Evaluation Report (EER).  Purpose  * To provide meaningful feedback to individuals on what is expected of them, advice on how well they are meeting those expectations, and advice on how to better meet those expectations. * To provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and potential based on that performance. * To provide officer central selection boards, senior NCO evaluation boards, the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS), and other personnel managers sound information to assist in identifying the best qualified enlisted personnel. In WAPS, past EPRs are worth up to 135 points.  Evaluation  An EPR evaluates the performance of an enlisted member both on and off duty. The period of time covered by the EPR is normally no less than 120 days and no longer than 365 days. EPRs are normally written by the member's supervisor with additional input provided by their supervisor's supervisor. Although the bulk of the evaluation is focused on their duty (job) performance, enlisted members are also evaluated on their off-duty performance in areas such as volunteerism and continuing education. This is arguably the biggest difference between the Air Force EPR and civilian counterparts. Personnel who have left the Air Force and are seeking jobs in the civilian world will sometimes use EPRs to augment their r√©sum√©.  Stratification statements  Stratification is the \\"rack-and- stack\\" process senior raters use to identify their top promotion-eligible master sergeants and senior master sergeants. Senior raters are limited to stratifying the top 10 percent of their master sergeant promotion-eligible Airmen and the top 20 percent of their senior master sergeant promotion- eligible Airmen. Promotion-eligible senior NCOs who are not stratified will have their evaluations close out at the deputy evaluator (first O-6) or intermediate evaluator (unit commander) level. Only those who are stratified will have their evaluation signed/closed out by the senior evaluator (senior rater). Stratification statements must be stated in quantitative terms (#1 of 125 MSgts) and will be based on the number of peers (in the same grade as the ratee) assigned within the evaluator's rating scheme. Stratification statements on all other performance reports, to include CMSgt reports, are strictly prohibited. Commander and senior enlisted members level up in their stage of professionalism through a complex point setting criteria that steers performance promotions. The point system and acquired testing baseline scores are gathered into a final summary score that can be adjusted on likeability, quarterly dorm room awards, and cookie bake-off volunteering. The process was developed through the AFI 39-1906, select Enron survey processes, and the Morgan Price home mortgage rating system.  Static Closeout Dates (SCOD)  In 2014/2015 reports were changed to close out on the same date every year and change of reporting official reports were eliminated. * SrA and below with 20 months or more TAFMS: 31 March (started in 2015) * SSgt: 31 January (started in 2015)SSgt EPR static closeout dates implemented as enlisted evaluation, promotion system changes continue , 9/25/2014, Air Force Personnel Center Public Affairs * TSgt: 30 November (started in 2014)AF implements static enlisted performance report closeout dates, eliminates change of reporting official reports * MSgt: 30 September (started in 2015) * SMSgt: 31 July * CMSgt: 31 May History On 12 July 2007 the Air Force announced a major overhaul of the content of the EPR and OPR reports in an effort to decrease the time required to accomplish the report. EPR narrative comments were significantly reduced and performance assessment areas now reflect the increased responsibility Airmen are charged with as they progress in rank. A section on physical fitness was added, with those scoring less than 75 receiving a referral report.Total person concept: New EPR changes in effect , Airman 1st Class Shane Dunaway, 4th Fighter Wing Public Affairs Another new feature of the EPR is the ratee's signature as well as the use of digital signatures using the Common Access Card (CAC).Randolph personnel experts explain new OPR, EPR process , 7/19/2007, Staff Sgt. Lindsey Maurice, 12th Flying Training Wing Public Affairs The implementation dates of the new versions were as follows: * Senior Master Sergeant: Aug. 1, 2007 * Chief Master Sergeant: Aug. 15, 2007 * Airman Basic to Senior Airman: Aug. 15, 2007 * Master Sergeant: Oct. 1, 2007 * Staff Sergeant: Jan. 1, 2008 * Technical Sergeant: Jan. 1, 2008 * Premier Band (3N2X1): April 1, 2008 The format for entries in the Enlisted Performance Report continues to be the \\"bullet statement format\\". On 1 January 2014 a revised AFI and slightly revised EPR forms were released adding organizational climate to the listed of items to consider in the Primary/Additional Duties section. Starting November 2014, static -or fixed - annual close out dates will be used for each rank tied to regular Air Force (RegAF) promotion eligibility cut-off dates (PECD). The static dates will enable the implementation of the forced distribution and restricted stratification policy and result in more accurate, useful performance-based evaluations. The new reports will include a section for promotion recommendations that will curb inflation through forced distribution and stratification restrictions.  Criticism  The EPR system has come under heavy criticism from all ranks in the Air Force. The primary complaint is that the system has become inflated.It's high time we deflate EPR ratings While technically the 1 through 5 scale is supposed to award an \\"average\\" performer a 3 and the 5 should be reserved for members that are \\"Truly Among the Best\\", the practice has been that nearly all personnel receive a 5 unless there are major disciplinary problems. The 2010 SSgt promotion cycle statistics show that the average eligible SrA received 128.79 points from a possible 135 from their EPR ratings, meaning the average eligible tester received one \\"4\\" and two \\"5\\" ratings. A cause may be that there is no additional guidance on the definition of a truly stellar member, and the deciding factor is most often other portions of WAPS testing, where performance is meant to be rated.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the buff-throated woodcreeper (X. guttatus). Description It is typically 23 cm long, and weighs 37 g. The head and neck are buff-streaked dark brown, the upper back is liver-brown, and the rest of the upperparts, wings and tail are rufous. The underparts are olive-brown with buff streaks on the breast. The bill is long, black, slightly decurved, and hooked at the tip. The normal call is a loud kew-kew-kew-kew. Distribution and habitat The bird breeds in tropical Central and South America in Trinidad, Tobago, northern Colombia and northern Venezuela. It is a common and widespread bird of forests and cultivated land with trees. Behaviour The cocoa woodcreeper builds a bark-lined nest in a tree hole or hollow stump and lays two white eggs. It is an insectivore which feeds on ants and other insects and spiders. It feeds low in trees or on the ground, usually alone, but groups of up to a dozen birds will follow columns of army ants. Systematics At Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica The cocoa woodcreeper was formerly included in the larger buff-throated woodcreeper, X. guttatus but has been recognized as specifically distinct. Eight subspecies are normally recognized, falling into two groups. It is not quite clear how these are related to each other and to the buff-throated woodcreeper.

Campaigns generally refer to broader strategic operations conducted over a large bit of territory and over a long period of time. Battles generally refer to short periods of intense combat localised to a specific area and over a specific period of time. However, use of the terms in naming such events is not consistent. For example, the First Battle of the Atlantic was more or less an entire theatre of war, and the so-called battle lasted for the duration of the entire war. Western Front List of Canadian battles during the First World War on the Western Front plaque in Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada The Western Front comprised the fractious borders between France, Germany, and the neighboring countries. It was infamous for the nature of the fight that developed there; after almost a full year of inconclusive fighting, the front had become a giant trench line stretching from one end of Europe to the other.Cowley and Parker (editors), pp. 521‚Äì526 1914 * Battle of Li√®ge alt=A diagram showing a city, surrounded by a ring of 12 fortresses, represented by red triangles. They are spaced out beyond the city, which is a gray area in the center. A river flows through the center, diagrammed in blue. The Battle of Li√®ge was the first battle of the war, and could be considered a moral victory for the allies, as the heavily outnumbered Belgians held out against the German Army for 12 days. From 5‚Äì16 August 1914, the Belgians successfully resisted the numerically superior Germans, and inflicted surprisingly heavy losses on their aggressors. The German Second Army, comprising 320,000 men, crossed into neutral Belgium in keeping to the Schlieffen Plan, with the ultimate goal of attacking France from the north. Li√®ge was key strategically as it held a position at the head of a pass through the Ardennes, which made it the best possible route into the heart of Belgium itself. The city was surrounded by a ring of 12 heavily armed forts, garrisoned by 70,000 men under the command of G√©rard Leman. A night attack on 5 August was repulsed with heavy losses to the Germans, to the extreme surprise of the supremely confident German army. The next day, rather than confront the forts in battle, the German commander Erich Ludendorff attacked the city through the back, through a break in the line of fortresses that the Belgians had intended to fortify, but never did so. Although they succeeded in capturing the city, the Germans knew that they could not continue advancing troops into Belgium without first breaking down the forts. Aided by 17-inch Howitzers, the Germans finally succeeded in bringing down the forts on 16 August. The unprecedented Belgian resistance seriously prolonged the opening German assault at the outbreak of World War I, allowing France and Britain time to organize themselves and a defense of Paris. In addition, it was an important moral victory for the Allies. =Battle of the Frontiers= The early French initiative, to capture territory lost to the Germans in the 1870‚Äì1871 Franco-Prussian War, which France started, was played out in a series of frontier battles between the Germans and the French, known collectively as the Battle of the Frontiers. The battles at Mulhouse, Lorraine, the Ardennes, Charleroi, and Mons were launched more or less simultaneously, and marked the collision of the German and French war plans, the Schlieffen Plan and Plan XVII, respectively. * Battle of M√ºlhausen The Battle of M√ºlhausen was the opening attack by the French against the Germans. The battle was part of a French attempt to conquer the province of Alsace, which had been lost as a consequence of having lost the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, as it had a majority of ethnic Germans. A French force under General Louis Bonneau detached from the French First Corps and invaded the frontier on August 8, 1914. Opposing them was the German 7th Division. The capture of the area, preordained by the French Plan XVII, was to boost national pride‚Äîand to provide a guard force for the flank of subsequent invasions. The French quickly captured the border town of Altkirch with a bayonet charge. Bonneau, suspicious of the little German resistance, was wary of a carefully planned German trap. However, under orders the next day he advanced to M√ºlhausen, capturing it with little effort, for the Germans had already abandoned it. In France, the conquering of the German city M√ºlhausen, without a fight, was celebrated greatly. However, with the arrival of German reserves from Stra√üburg, the tides were turned, and the Germans mounted a counter-attack on nearby Cernay. Unable to mount an all-encompassing defense, and unable to call on reserves of his own, Bonneau began a slow withdrawal from the region. Support troops hastily sent by the French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre arrived too late to prevent Bonneau from retiring. Joffre was immensely angry with Bonneau, charging him with a \\"lack of aggression\\" and immediately relieving him of command. Realizing the psychological magnitude of the loss, he assembled a force, led by Paul Pau, which tried unsuccessfully to recapture the province. * Battle of Lothringen alt=A long row of heavy cavalry stretches down a street, taking up most of the space. A woman in the foreground is reaching out and giving flowers to one of the men. They are wearing plate armour around the chest, and a crested hat on top. The invasion and recapture of Lorraine formed one of the major parts of the French pre-war strategy, Plan XVII. The loss of Lorraine (and Alsace; see above) to the Prussians in the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was seen as a national humiliation by the public and military alike, and was at the forefront of their minds for the next war against the Germans. The battle was initiated by the French First and Second armies. The First, led by General Auguste Dubail, intended to take Sarrebourg, whilst the Second, led by General Noel de Castelnau, intended to take Morhange. Both towns were well fortified, and the task of defending them fell to Crown Prince Rupprecht, who had overall control of the German Sixth and Seventh armies. Rupprecht adopted a strategy in which he would fall back under the French attacks, then counter-attack once he lured the French all the way to his fortifications. As the French army advanced, it met stern resistance in the form of German artillery and machine-gun fire. Army Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke authorized a more aggressive tactic soon after, and on August 20, the German army started to roll back the French. Caught by surprise and without the assistance of entrenched positions, the Second Army was pushed back quickly, eventually into France itself. A gap was exposed between the forces in Mulhouse and those in Lorraine; the forces in Mulhouse were withdrawn to keep the gap from being taken advantage of by the Germans. Diverging from the Schlieffen Plan, Rupprecht received reinforcements and attacked the French line near the Trou√©e de Charmes; however, through the use of reconnaissance aircraft, the French spotted the German buildup, and were able to build an adequate defence. Thus the German gains were minimized, and were eradicated by a following French counter-assault on the 25th. Fighting continued there until the end of August, and quickly ground into a stalemate and trench warfare. * Battle of the Ardennes The Battle of Ardennes, fought between 21 and 23 August 1914, was another of the early frontier battles, conducted during the first month of the war. The battle was sparked by the mutual collision of French and German invasion forces in the lower Ardennes Forest. The pre-war French strategy expected German forces in the area to be light, and the French light, rapid firing artillery was expected to convey an advantage in forested terrain over the bigger German guns. Instead, it became increasingly apparent to all of the commanders in the region that a significant enemy presence was gathering, for the Germans had planned an offensive through the area. The sets of armies joined battle on both sides. General Pierre Ruffey's Third Army to the south and Fernand de Langle de Cary's Fourth Army to the north, fighting Germany's Fourth, led by Duke Albrecht, and Fifth army, led by Crown Prince Wilhelm. The German troops started moving through the forest on 19 August. Conditions worsened, and by the time the two armies met, the forest was covered in a deep fog, resulting in the two forces stumbling into one another. At first, the French took the Germans as a light screening force; however, in reality the French were heavily outnumbered. The first day of the battle consisted of light skirmishes; the main battle did not begin until 21 August. According to the pre-war French strategy document, Plan XVII, German forces in the area were only expected to be light, with French light, rapid-firing artillery proving advantageous in a wooded terrain such as that found in the Ardennes. However, what emerged was totally opposite; the French eagerly charged at German positions in the woods, and were mowed down by machine-gun fire. The French armies retreated hurriedly in the face of superior German tactical positioning, and the Germans chased them all the way back into the French border. In addition to losing a key strategic position, the French forfeited iron resources in the region as well. * Battle of Charleroi The Battle of Charleroi, another of the frontier battles, was an action taking place 12‚Äì23 August 1914. The battle was joined by the French Fifth Army, advancing north towards the River Sambre, and the German Second and Third armies, moving southwest through Belgium. The Fifth army was meant to join the Third and Fourth armies in their attack through the Ardennes. However, this plan was put into effect assuming the Germans were not considering an assault further north, through Belgium--which was the German plan all along. Charles Lanrezac, commander of the Fifth Army, was strongly against the idea, fearing an attack from the north. However Joseph Joffre, chief-of-staff, rejected any such idea; after much persuasion, Lanrezac finally convinced him to move the Fifth Army northwards. However, by the time the Fifth Army arrived, units of the German Second Army were already in the area. Joffre authorized an attack across the Sambre, predicting that the German force had 18 divisions, comparable to Lanrezac's 15, plus another 3 British reinforcements (the British Expeditionary Force). However, Lanrezac predicted much higher numbers, closer to the actual number‚Äî32 German divisions. He preferred to wait for reinforcements, however that same day the Germans attacked across the river and established two beachheads, neither of which fell despite several French counterattacks. The next day, the main attack began; the fighting carried on through the day, and into the next. The French centre suffered severe losses and retreated; but the west and east flanks both held their ground. However, the retreat of cavalry divisions to the far west exposed the French west flank. With news of his situation, and the fact that his flanks could give and be completely enwrapped, Lanrezac ordered a general retreat into northern France. * Siege of Maubeuge The French town of Maubeuge was a major fort on the French side of the border. With a junction of no fewer than five major railway lines, it was recognized as a key strategic position by both sides; hence the construction of 15 forts and gun batteries ringing it, a total of 435 guns, and a permanent garrison of 35,000 troops. These were further bolstered by the choosing of the town as the advance base of the British Expeditionary Force. However, when these and the French Fifth Army retreated following the events at Charleroi, the town was cut off from allied support, and subsequently besieged on August 25. The German heavy artillery succeeded in demolishing the key forts around the city, and General Joseph Anthelme Fournier, in command of the garrison in the city, surrendered to the Germans some 13 days later. 1914 * Battle of Le Cateau * Battle of St. Quentin, also called the Battle of Guise * First Battle of the Marne * First Battle of the Aisne * Siege of Antwerp * First Battle of Albert * First Battle of Arras * Battle of the Yser * First Battle of Ypres * First Battle of Champagne 1915 * Battle of Neuve Chapelle * Second Battle of Ypres * Second Battle of Artois * Battle of Loos * Second Battle of Champagne 1916 * Battle of Verdun * Battle of Hulluch * Battle of the Somme * Battle of Fromelles * Battle of Pozi√®res * Battle of Ginchy 1917 * Nivelle Offensive * Battle of Arras (1917) * Battle of Vimy Ridge * Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne * Battle of Messines * Third Battle of Ypres, also called the Battle of Passchendaele * Battle of La Malmaison * Battle of Cambrai (1917) 1918 * German Spring Offensive * First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Battle of St. Quentin or the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle) * Battle of the Lys, also known as the Fourth Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Estaires * Third Battle of the Aisne * Battle of Cantigny * Battle of Belleau Wood * Second Battle of the Marne * Battle of Soissons (1918) * Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry (1918) * Hundred Days Offensive * Battle of Amiens * Second Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Third Battle of the Somme * Battle of Saint-Mihiel * Battle of Ep√©hy * Battle of the Hindenburg Line * Meuse-Argonne Offensive, also called the Battle of the Argonne Forest * Battle of Cambrai (1918) * Battle of the Sambre (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Sambre  Italian Campaign  * First Battle of the Isonzo * Second Battle of the Isonzo * Third Battle of the Isonzo * Fourth Battle of the Isonzo * Fifth Battle of the Isonzo * Trentino Offensive or the \\"Battle of Asiago\\" * Sixth Battle of the Isonzo or the \\"Battle of Gorizia\\" * Seventh Battle of the Isonzo * Eighth Battle of the Isonzo * Ninth Battle of the Isonzo * Tenth Battle of the Isonzo * Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo * Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo or the \\"Battle of Caporetto\\" * Battle of the Piave River * Battle of Vittorio Veneto  Eastern Front  1914 * Battle of Stallup√∂nen * Battle of Gumbinnen * Battle of Tannenberg * Battle of Galicia * First Battle of the Masurian Lakes * Battle of the Vistula River * Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (1914) * Battle of Limanowa 1915 * Siege of Przemysl * Battle of Bolimov * Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes * Great Retreat (Russian) * Sventiany Offensive 1916 * Lake Naroch Offensive * Brusilov Offensive **Battle of Lutsk **Battle of Kostiuchn√≥wka **Battle of Kowel 1917 * Kerensky Offensive * Russian Revolution 1918 * Operation Faustschlag  Romanian Campaign  1916 * Battle of Transylvania (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of Turtucaia (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of Dobrich (Bulgarian Victory) * First Battle of Cobadin (Romanian-Russian Victory) * (Central Powers Victory) * (Romanian Victory) * Battle of Turnu Ro»ôu Pass (Romanian victory) * FlƒÉm√¢nda Offensive (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of Brass√≥ (1916) (Central Powers Victory) * (Romanian Victory) * (Romanian Victory) * First Battle of Oituz (Romanian Victory) * Second Battle of Cobadin (Central Powers Victory) * First Battle of the Jiu Valley (Romanian Victory) * Second Battle of the Jiu Valley (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of Vulcan Pass (Central Powers Victory) * Second Battle of Oituz (Romanian Victory) * (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of RobƒÉne»ôti (German Victory) * Battle of Bucharest (Central Powers Victory) * Prunaru Charge (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of the Arge»ô (Central Powers Victory) * Battle of R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat (Central Powers Victory) 1917 * Battle of Tulcea (Romanian Victory) * Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti (Romanian-Russian Victory) * Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti (Romanian-Russian Victory) * Third Battle of Oituz (Romanian-Russian Victory)  Caucasus Campaign  * Battle of Sarikamish (December 1914 - January 1915) *Battle of Ardahan *Defense of Van (1915) * Battle of Manzikert (1915) * Battle of Kara Killisse *Erzurum Offensive **Battle of Koprukoy *Battle of Erzincan * Battle of Baku  Serbian Campaign  * Battle of Cer *Srem Offensive * Battle of Drina * Battle of Kolubara * Battle of Morava * Battle of Kosovo (1915) * Battle of Ovche Pole  Gallipoli Campaign  W Beach, Helles, on January 7, 1916, just prior to the final evacuation of British forces during the Gallipoli Campaign.

Almost as soon as they were invented, planes were drafted for military service. See also the following articles: * Aviation in World War I * Aviation history (1914-1918) * Flying aces * List of World War I flying aces * Strategic bombing during World War I * Zeppelins in World War I Contemporary wars Some historians consider these conflicts to be part of the First World War, having started either during or just after the war. In some cases, these conflicts were not directly caused by the war yet were exacerbated by them. For example, the 1916 Easter Rising was caused by factors generally unrelated to the war in Europe, yet took place at the time it did due to the British Army being thinly stretched in 1916, as well as the promise of German support in fighting the British, among many other factors. Others, such as the Mexican Revolution, began before but influenced the war in terms of materiel or as factors taken into consideration by the belligerents. In the cause of the Ottoman Wars, these motivated the Young Turks to move towards war against the Allied Powers. = Pre-First World War = * Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1920) * Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912) * First Balkan War (1912‚Äì13) * Second Balkan War (1913) * Muscat rebellion (1913-20) * Zaian War (1914-21) * Kurdish rebellions during World War I (1914-17) = During the First World War = * Maritz Rebellion (1914‚Äì15) * Easter Rising (1916) * Warlord Era (1916‚Äì1928) * Senussi Campaign (1915‚Äì17) *Arab Revolt (1916-1918) *Russian Revolution (1917) * Finnish Civil War (1918) * Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì22) ** North Russia Campaign (1918‚Äì19) ** Russian westward offensive (1918‚Äì19) = Post-First World War = * Greater Poland Uprising (1918‚Äì19) * Hungarian-Romanian War (1918‚Äì19) * Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì21) * Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì21) * Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì23) * Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì22) * Vlora War (1920) * Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì23) ReferencesSources * Battles of World War I Battle ","title":"List of military engagements of World War I"},{"id":"2278236","text":"The year 1931 in archaeology involved some significant events.

History The church organized in 1821, but it had its origins in Hartford in the late 18th century, during the period when the Congregational church was dominant in the area. At that time, a sizable group of people, influenced by Elhanan Winchester, began to reject Calvinist doctrine and espouse a belief in the universal goodness of God. In 1821, after a visit to Hartford by Hosea Ballou of Boston, the \\"First Independent Universalist Society of the City of Hartford\\" was formed and called its first minister. The name was changed in 1870 to \\"Church of the Redeemer\\" -- to give the church \\"a specific title or name\\", and in the early 1960s was changed to \\"The Universalist Church of West Hartford\\". The first meetinghouse, located in downtown Hartford across the street from the Old State House, was completed and dedicated in 1824. It was used until 1860. In 1860 the church moved to a larger building on Main Street at the site where the Travelers Tower now stands. In 1906, the church moved out of downtown, to a building on Asylum Hill. Each of the first three churches was located on prime real estate in the city of Hartford, so the sale of the property each time largely financed the building of the next church. The present building was dedicated in 1931, and a sizable addition completed in 1962. It is in a strictly residential neighborhood in West Hartford, but serves a much larger community, both urban and suburban. The present building in West Hartford dates from 1931, with the addition of Fiske Hall, some church school rooms and a new sanctuary organ in 1962. The church maintains membership in the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), organized in 1961 by the merger of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America. In the early years of the church, ministers‚Äô tenures in general were only a few years. However, since the 1860s there have been long series of ministries, averaging fifteen years. Most notable is the 25-year ministry of former Minister Emeritus, The Reverend Wallace Grant Fiske, followed by fifteen years with The Reverend Frederick Lipp and twelve years with The Reverend Stephen Kendrick. In 2001, The Reverend Dr. Judith Walker-Riggs joined the church as Interim Minister. On November 17, 2002, Jan Katrina Nielsen was installed as the 22nd Senior Minister in the history of this church. Building The present church building edifice is a colonial-style, tall-steepled building, erected in 1931 and designed by Walter Crabtree. A large addition was constructed in 1962 includes additional church school rooms, music room, Fiske Hall, a large multi-purpose parish hall with a stage and main kitchen. Between the sanctuary and the addition is the most-used areas, containing newly expanded office space, conference room, library, program center with kitchen and a formal parlor. The church is one of the many in West Hartford to have a youth group, a place for teens to meet and reflect on the spirituality together. The sanctuary seats up to 350 in double rows of pews flanking a center aisle. The memorial stained glass windows which grace the chancel area were designed originally for the former church building. These and other memorial windows were saved and incorporated into this building. An Austin pipe organ was installed in 1963. On the west side of the building is a memorial garden dedicated in 1985. A large parking lot, which is leased from the Town of West Hartford, borders the south side of the property. The church also has a ten-room brick colonial parsonage on Middlefield Drive which it acquired in 1942. On December 5, 1999, the entire church was renovated with a total expenditure of $1.5 million. The extensive renovations touched nearly every inch of the building, including the refurbishing of the sanctuary and addition of a three-floor two-door elevator.

The Chinese crocodile lizard spends much of its time in shallow water or in overhanging branches and vegetation, where it hunts its prey of insects, snails, tadpoles, and worms. Individuals in captivity may be fed baby mice.Chinese Crocodile Lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus). The Sacramento Zoological Society. A rare and little-studied lizard, it is listed in CITES Appendix II, which regulates international trade of specimens. CITES Web Gallery. This is the only species in the monotypic genus Shinisaurus.Huang, C. M., et al. (2008). Population and conservation strategies for the Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) in China. Animal Biodiversity and Conservation 31(2) 63-70.  Taxonomy  Shinisaurus (literally \\"Shin's lizard\\") honours the biologist (), a member of a joint Chinese-German expedition that discovered this species (as well as the frog Quasipaa shini). Its specific name ‚Äì like the separate genus Crocodilurus ‚Äì means \\"crocodile- tail\\". Shinisaurus was once also regarded as a member of Xenosauridae, but most recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of anguimorphs consider Shinisaurus to be more closely related to monitor lizards and helodermatids than to Xenosaurus. It is now placed in its own family: Shinisauridae. Two subspecies are recognized: * Shinisaurus crocodilurus crocodilurus Ahl, 1930 (southeast China) * Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis Schingen et al., 2016 ‚Äî Vietnamese crocodile lizard (northeast Vietnam) Description The Chinese crocodile lizard is green, colored with reddish neck markings and alternating bands of light and dark marks. Males are more colorful than females, especially during the breeding season. They are 40‚Äì46 cm (16‚Äì18 in) long. Perhaps its most distinctive features are the rows of enlarged, bony scales down its back and muscular tail that resemble those of a crocodile. Conservation A 2008 study estimated that 950 crocodile lizards left in China, while another study estimated that fewer than 150 adults were left in Vietnam. Habitat loss is a major threat to the species. The population decline of the Chinese crocodile lizard can be explained by a combination of poaching, water flow changes (such as small scale dam construction), mining, electrofishing, and the poisoning of fish supply due to agricultural waste. It has been listed on CITES Appendix II since 1990; there are low levels of legal exports for the pet trade with CITES permits, but it is believed that illegal collection occurs at a higher level. In 2014, it was listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List based on severe population declines and ongoing threats.

The abbey is named for St. Meinrad, a monk who died in 861. It is one of only two archabbeys in the United States and one of 11 in the world. The abbey is located approximately 15 minutes from Monastery Immaculate Conception in Ferdinand, Indiana. Immaculate Conception is for Benedictine women. Because of the presence of the Archabbey, Harrison Township is located within the Archdiocese of Indianapolis instead the Diocese of Evansville, like the rest of Spencer County. The Benedictine community at Saint Meinrad consists of men who dedicate their lives to prayer and work. They gather in community five times a day‚Äîfor morning prayer, Mass, noon prayer, evening prayer and compline‚Äîto pray for the Church and the world. Guests often join the monks in prayer in the Archabbey Church. Gregorian chant is sung in the canonical hours of the monastic Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the Psalms, in the Great Responsories of Matins, and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and Compline. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories. In addition, the monks spend private time reading spiritual and religious materials. They live under the Rule of St. Benedict, the 6th-century instructions for community living written by St. Benedict. The abbey is named for the 8th-century Saint Meinrad of Einsiedeln. History Archabbey Church The monks came to southern Indiana at the request of a local priest (Fr. Joseph Kundek) for assistance in addressing the pastoral needs of the growing German-speaking Catholic population and to prepare local men to be priests. St. Meinrad became an abbey in 1870,Saint Meinrad Archabbey History: 1854-1954, Albert Kleber, OSB with Martin Marty as abbot and Fintan Mundwiler as prior. Saint Meinrad now operates a graduate school of theology and has more than a score of its monks in parish work, chaplaincies, and diocesan assignments. Shortly after arriving in Indiana, the Benedictines began offering high school courses to local youths. In 1861, the monks expanded their general courses to include undergraduate courses in philosophy and theology. Through these programs, the monks of Saint Meinrad began their mission, which continues today: preparing men for service in the Church as priests. The undergraduate degree program, St. Meinrad College, closed in 1998, despite the fact that it began admitting men who were not seeking the priesthood, and had considered admitting women. In 1877, the Abbot of Saint Meinrad Abbey, Martin Marty, negotiated with an agent of the LR&FS; Railroad Company, for land to establish a Benedictine monastery in northern Arkansas. The Subiaco Abbey and Academy was founded on March 15, 1878, upon the arrival of three monk-missionaries from Saint Meinrad Abbey. In 1889, a group of monks left from St. Meinrad Abbey to travel to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. They came with an invitation from the Archbishop there to found a college seminary to train local vocations. The monks founded Saint Joseph Abbey, located in Saint Benedict, near Covington, Louisiana, north of New Orleans. Saint Joseph Abbey is now the home of a total of 32 monks who run Saint Joseph Seminary College, and a number of other ministries around the Diocese. In 1933, Saint Meinrad founded Marmion Abbey in Aurora, IL and in 1950 Blue Cloud Abbey near Marvin, South Dakota. Then, in 1958, the monks of Saint Meinrad founded Prince of Peace Abbey in Oceanside, CA.2010 Ordo, Swiss- American Congregation O.S.B. Blue Cloud Abbey was founded in order to serve the local Native American population. Due to declining numbers and an aging population, Blue Cloud was closed by its remaining members in 2012. Prince of Peace and Marmion abbeys continue to operate. In 1954 St. Meinrad Abbey was elevated to Archabbey by the Holy See. A Celtic cross in front of the School of Theology Seminary and School of Theology The Seminary and School of Theology offers graduate-level degrees in theology. Priesthood candidates work toward a Master of Divinity. Lay degree students can earn a Master of Arts (Theology) or a Master of Arts (Pastoral Theology). A two-year pre-theology program leads to a Master of Catholic Philosophical Studies. Saint Meinrad began offering lay degree programs in 1969, although students worked on their degrees during the six-week Summer Session program. In the fall of 1993, the Seminary and School of Theology expanded its mission to allow lay ministry students to attend classes during any of the academic terms. While some classes specifically aimed at ordination preparation are reserved for MDiv students, lay ministers sometimes pursue their graduate degrees as part-time or full-time students. More than 5,000 men and women have studied in the School of Theology. Other programs in the Seminary and School of Theology include a permanent deacon formation program, which assists Catholic dioceses in the formation of their deacon candidates, and a youth and vocations program, which encourages high school and college students to participate more deeply in the Church's liturgy and consider a vocation of service to the Church. The Seminary and School of Theology also houses the Institute for Priests and Presbyterates, which offers continuing formation for priests making the transition from seminary to parish life, priests preparing for their first assignment as pastor, and presbyterates - which is the group of priests and their bishop in a Catholic diocese. In 1995, there was a controversy over the firing of a theologian, Carmel McEnroy, who taught at the school. In the spring of 1994, Pope John Paul II had issued an Apostolic Letter declaring the issue of the ordination of women as priests resolved and no longer open to debate. Several months after the statement was issued, Dr. McEnroy joined 1,500 others in signing an open letter opposing the Pope's teachings on the subject. After reading the open letter in the National Catholic Reporter, the Archabbot determined that Dr. McEnroy must be removed from the faculty at Saint Meinrad for publicly dissenting from the Pope's teachings. Dr. McEnroy sued on a claim of breach of contract. The lower court dismissed the case, citing lack of jurisdiction, which decision was upheld on appeal. Abbey Press Saint Meinrad Archabbey owned and operated an international company that produced and marketed religious, spiritual and inspirational cards, books and gifts. At one time, Abbey Press was one of the largest business enterprises in Spencer County, Indiana, with more than 100 employees. The press was founded in 1867 when the Benedictine monks purchased a used printing press. Abbey Press marketed its products throughout the United States and in 25 English-speaking countries. More than 20 foreign companies are licensed to print some of Abbey Press' publications in native languages. Net proceeds from the sales of Abbey Press products support the good work and ministries of Saint Meinrad Archabbey. As of June 30, 2017, Abbey Press closed\\"Abbey Press\\", St. Meinrad and the printing presses and other equipment were sold. Just over 70 people lost their jobs. Abbey Caskets Abbey Caskets is a work of Saint Meinrad Archabbey. Founded in 1999, Abbey Caskets offers handcrafted wooden caskets and cremation urns directly to the public. The caskets and cremation urns are made from solid hardwoods, in the choice of poplar, cherry, walnut and oak. The Monastic Abbey Casket is designed after the caskets used by the monks of Saint Meinrad. Abbey Caskets also offers a more conventional casket, the Traditional Abbey Casket.

It features random encounters with side-scrolling battles, although some boss battles are fought with a traditional menu-based system. There are also a few platforming sections. In single-player mode, the main character is Jack. The game can be switched between single player and multiplayer at will, with the second player controlling Ryu. Jack and Ryu share statistics, so one character never overpowers the other. Super Ninja Boy features a password system to record progress. It is a sequel to Culture Brain's previous title, Little Ninja Brothers for the NES and contains a few cameos from other Culture Brain's games. Gameplay Super Ninja Boy combines classic role-playing video game elements with action game elements. The player controls the main character Jack (or two players can control both Jack and Ryu) and randomly encounters enemies on the world map and in dungeons. In side-scrolling battles, the player can jump, punch, throw enemies, use items like shurikens or techniques such as the super jump or fireball. Battles take place in a beat'em up style and end after a specific number of enemies are killed (no matter how many are still remaining on screen). Boss battles are fought in a turn-based RPG style, using the same items and skills as normally. There are also some 2D platform areas, which play the same as the normal battles without depth (the player can only go right or left).

He is most widely known, however, as a solo artist, as well as a participant in many other groups, such as Bisso Na Bisso and Dis l'heure 2 zouk.  Biography  Passi was born on 21 December 1972, in Kinshasa, Republic of the Congo. In 1979, his family moved to Sarcelles, a suburb of Paris. He graduated from lyc√©e and created the band Minist√®re AMER with Stomy Bugsy, who he had gone to school with. The group's first album, Pourquoi tant de haine?, was released in 1992, and Passi was forced to end his agronomy studies at the University of Paris (Nanterre) to be able to focus on music. Minist√®re AMER followed up with \\"95200\\" which was released in 1994. Passi's first solo album, Les tentations, was released in 1997, and it sold 450,000 copies. The project Bisso na Bisso (meaning 'Just between ourselves' in Lingala, Congo's most widely spoken language), was a collective of French hip hop artists with African origins. It included names such as √Ñrsenik, and he released their album Racines in 1999. That same year, Passi released his second solo album, Gen√®se. In 2002, Passi was asked to create the anthem for the African Nations Cup football competition together with Congolese singer Papa Wemba. The two eventually managed to attract into the project such names as Youssou N'Dour and Cheb Mami. Passi's third album, Odyss√©e, came out in 2004. Passi is also known as the artist whose song, \\"Il fait chaud\\" (\\"It's hot\\"), was featured in the last episode in the television show, Sex and the City. The song was not credited at the end of the show, leaving many viewers to call the song simply \\"The French Rap\\". Passi appeared in an episode of Season 27 of The Amazing Race in 2015, in which teams were required to perform one of his songs, \\"79 √† 99\\", as part of a detour challenge. If their French pronunciation, rhythm and vibes were correct, Passi would give them their next clue.

The lake is the largest entirely situated in Indiana with of water surface area spread over the counties of Monroe and Brown. Capacity varies from to depending on water level. It is also home to of protected forest and three recreational areas (Fairfax, Hardin Ridge, and Paynetown). Indiana's only federally protected U.S. Wilderness Area, the Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area, is located on the south shore. The pool elevation (above sea level) is about 538 ft (164 m) year-round. During colder winters, limited ice fishing is available on protected backwater portions of the reservoir. Ransburg Scout Reservation, a large Boy Scout camp comprising over 624 acres, is situated along the eastern shore with a private dock system in Siscoe Bay (also known as Boy Scout Bay). The largest marina situated on the lake is the Fourwinds Resort and Marina with over 800 boats. The reservoir provides abundant fishing throughout the year, and recreational opportunities such as boating and water skiing attract visitors from throughout Indiana and the Midwest.  Construction of Monroe  Salt Creek's valley below the dam; this is what land now under the lake looked like before the lake was built Construction on the lake began in 1960 and was finished in 1965 at a cost of $16.5 million. Salt Creek was dammed south of Bloomington, Indiana and the reservoir fills the valley to the northeast of the dam extending into adjacent Brown County. It was thought that Elkinsville, a town in southern Brown County, had to be abandoned due to the path of the backwaters. Therefore, the town was acquired through the power of eminent domain. Later, this was found not to be necessary; the result of a mistake in elevation estimates. The lake was designed as a primary water source for the City of Bloomington and to prevent flood damage downstream. The lake was created and is still managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District.

It is the home of Atalanta and has a capacity of 21,300 seats. The field is long, and wide. History The stadium has undergone a series of renovations since 2010 due to its age and features that were seen to be outdated compared to other Serie A facilities. Most of the seats in the stadium lack weather protection. Projects for a new stadium have been put forward, though issues with funding and location have stifled these plans. As a result, the stadium will be gradually redeveloped, with the first phase of improvements completed prior to the 2015‚Äì16 season, with future work to be carried out if a 99-year lease can be agreed with the city council. The first stage improvements included the removal of the pitch side barrier, one of the first Serie A clubs to make this change, along with improved bench facilities for players and the introduction of luxury boxes atop the grandstand. New seating areas for disabled spectators were also added. At the same time, the press box has been lowered and moved towards the pitch. These improvements came with a reduction in overall capacity by around 3,000 seats. Atalanta officially acquired the stadium on 8 August 2017, completing an ‚Ç¨8.6 million transaction with the city government. The club also paid ‚Ç¨2.6 million for the first phase of redevelopment. On 30 April 2019, a new phase of renovations began with the demolition of the Curva Nord \\"Federico Pisani\\" (North Stand). The planned renovation is expected to be completed by 2021, costing around ‚Ç¨40 million in total.

It is a structural isomer of valpromide, a valproic acid prodrug; unlike valpromide, however, valnoctamide is not transformed into its homologous acid, valnoctic acid, in vivo. Indications In addition to being a sedative, valnoctamide has been investigated for use in epilepsy. It was studied for neuropathic pain in 2005 by Winkler et al., with good results: it had minimal effects on motor coordination and alertness at effective doses, and appeared to be equally effective as gabapentin. RH Belmaker, Yuly Bersudsky and Alex Mishory started a clinical trial of valnoctamide for prophylaxis of mania in lieu of the much more teratogenic valproic acid or its salts. Side effects The side effects of valnoctamide are mostly minor and include somnolence and the slight motor impairments mentioned above. Interactions Valnoctamide is known to increase through inhibition of epoxide hydrolase the serum levels of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, the active metabolite of carbamazepine, sometimes to toxic levels.

The Kumam are an ethnic group of people found in Kaberamaido district, district in Eastern Uganda. Formerly they shared Soroti district with the Iteso and some parts of formerly Lira district with the Langi. In the Lango region, they are now found in Dokolo district which was detached from Lira District. They are found at the shores of Lake Kyoga (Namasale). In Soroti district, they are found in Serere, Asuret, Soroti town as well as the outskirts of Soroti district neighboring Kaberamaido. They speak a Luo language similar to the language spoken by the Lango, with some Ateso vocabulary. Kumam traditions say are part of the Iteso people. They probably lost their Eastern Nilotic Ateker language and took up the Western Nilotic Luo spoken by their Lango and Acholi neighbours - due to prolonged contact and intermarriages.  Origin  The Kumam descend from the early fishing, agricultural, and herding communities of Ethiopia. They migrated southwards towards Uganda because of land pressure around the 17th century. Today, they live on the shores of Lake Kyoga in the districts of Serere, Soroti and Kaberamaido  Culture and customs = Political set-up = The Kumam had political structure under clan leaders known as wegi Atekerin. Other people of importance in the society were wegi ikodeta Cel (leaders of dancing groups), and leaders of Asonya(ancient) homes, wegi Cel. The wegi Cel were in most cases Dogolan or Odonge ikekoros (heads of part of a clan descending form one man). These clan leaders were responsible for the maintenance of law and order as well as general administration. They arbitrated in matters of politics and social affairs. = Social set-up = Music, dance and story telling played a big part in kumam lifestyle. At any time music would be made, at various functions, such as ceremonial, religious and political functions. In the evening, the old people would narrate stories to the younger generation as part of the oral traditions. = Marriage = Previously, the parents would arrange marriages for their children. Girls would be betrothed to boys at an early age. In effect, the young girl would become wife to a respective boy but she would wait to be officially handed over when she came of age. In some cases, the young girls so betrothed would be taken to the boy's home to grow up there. When she came of age, a ceremony would be organized to formalize the relationship. With time however the system changed. Today, the boy goes looking for a girl and without the consent of the parents and sneak with her to his home at night. After a week or so, the girl's relatives would begin to look for her. Obviously they had some prior knowledge of her whereabouts. On discovery, a fine would be exacted from the boy. Arrangements would be made to settle the bride wealth and the marriage would be formalized.

Ahilya was born in the village of Chondi in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. She moved the seat of her fiefdom to Maheshwar south of Indore on the Narmada River. Ahilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of Kumbher in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, died. A year after that she took over the affairs of Holkar fief. She tried to protect her land from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukoji Rao Holkar as the Chief of her militia. Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of Hindu temples. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India. Early life Ahilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the Patil of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write. Her entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723‚Äì1754). She was married to Khanderao Holkar in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767. Ahilyabai broke another tradition when she married her daughter to Yashwantrao a brave but poor man after he succeeded in defeating the dacoits. Reign The Royal Palace of Maheshwar Courtyard of the royal palace (Rajwada), Maheshwar Statue of Ahilya Bai Holkar in the royal palace, Maheshwar Her husband was killed during the siege of Kumher in 1754. In 1754, on request of support from Imad-ul-Mulk, the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur's Mir Bakhshi, Ahilya Bai's husband Khanderao Holkar, in the army of his father Malhar Rao Holkar, laid the siege of Kumher fort of Jat Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur State who had sided with the Mughal Emperor's rebellious wazir Safdar Jang. Khanderao was inspecting his troops on an open palanquin in the battle of Kumher when was hit and killed by a cannonball from the Jat army. After his death in 1754, his father Malhar Rao prevented his wife Ahilya Bai from committing sati. Malhar Rao Holkar died in 1766, 12 years after the death of his son Khanderao. Malhar Rao's grandson and Khanderao's only son Male Rao Holkar became the ruler of Indore in 1766, under the regentship of Ahilyabai, but he too died within few months on 5 April 1767. Ahilyabai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her son with Khanderao. A letter to her from her father-in-law Malhar Rao in 1765 illustrates the trust he had in her ability during the tempestuous battle for power in the 18th century: :\\"Proceed to Gwalior after crossing the Chambal. You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible....On the march you should arrange for military posts being located for protection of the road.\\" Already trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar Tukojirao Holkar (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear. Among Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest- houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right. There are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh. Ahilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the Bhils and Gonds, who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \\"considerate attention to their habits\\". Ahilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, Moropant and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar. After her death, she was succeeded by Tukoji Rao Holkar I, her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son Kashi Rao Holkar in 1797. Death Ahilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore‚Äôs history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar. Views about her Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh \\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years.

Malcolm) Malcolm, J., A Memoir of Central India, quoted in John Keay called her 'The Philosopher Queen', a reference perhaps to the 'Philosopher king' Bhoj: \\"This great ruler in Indore encouraged all within her realm to do their best, Merchants produced their finest clothes, trade flourished, the farmers were at peace and oppression ceased, for each case that came to the queen's notice was dealt with severely. She loved to see her people prosper, and to watch the fine cities grow, and to watch that her subjects were not afraid to display their wealth, lest the ruler should snatch it from them. Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travelers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse. Ahalya Bai was seventy years old when her long and splendid life closed. Indore long mourned its noble Queen, happy had been her reign, and her memory is cherished with deep reverence unto this day.\\" (Annie Besant \\"From the original papers and letters, it becomes clear that she was the first-class politician, and that was why she readily extended her support to Mahadji Shinde. I have no hesitation in saying that without the support of Ahilyabai, Mahadji would never have gained so much importance in the politics of northern India.\\" (Historian Judunath Sarkar) \\"Definitely no woman and no ruler are like Ahilyabai Holkar.\\" (Nizam of Hyderabad) \\"It reveals beyond doubt that all ideal virtues described by Plato and Bhattacharya were present in her personalities like Dilip, Janak, Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, and Yudhishthir. After thorough scrutiny of the long history of the world, we find only one personality of Lokmata Devi Ahilya that represents an absolutely ideal ruler.\\" (Arvind Javlekar) A commemorative stamp was issued in her honour on 25 August 1996 by the Republic of India. As a tribute to the great ruler, Indore domestic airport has been named Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport. Similarly, Indore university has been renamed as \\"Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya\\". Works throughout India Ahilya Ghat, Varanasi The current structure of Vishnupad Temple is built by Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar in 1787 Ahilya Bai's Fort It was the specialty of the Holkar family that they did not use public funds to meet their personal and family expenses. They had their personal fund from their private property. Ahilyabai inherited personal funds which at that time was estimated to be sixteen crores rupees. Ahilyabai used the personal fund in charitable works.

Nature of economic torts Economic torts are tortious interference actions designed to protect trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law and modern competition law, and certain laws governing intellectual property, particularly unfair competition law. The \\"absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon.\\" The principal torts are: :* passing off, :* injurious falsehood and trade libel (see also Food libel laws), :* conspiracy, :* inducement of breach of contract, :* tortious interference (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade), :* negligent misrepresentation, and :* watching and besetting. These torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers). Two cases demonstrate economic torts' affinity to competition and labour law. In Mogul Steamship Co LtdMogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co (1889) LR 23 QBD 598 the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this cartel was ruled lawful and \\"nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.\\"per Bowen LJ, (1889) LR 23 QBD 598, 614 Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel. In English labour law the most notable case is Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy, interference with a commercial contract or intimidation.  Recent developments Several of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and \\"tortious interference\\" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords: :* In OBG Ltd v Allan, [2007] UKHL 21. the majority adopted a restrictive view of the unlawful means tort, where the plaintiff has a claim only where the wrong to the third party would have been actionable at the instance of that third party, and he must have an economic interest at stake in the interference by the defendant with that third party. :* In Total Network SL v Revenue and Customs, the House of Lords distinguished the conspiracy tort from the unlawful means tort and held that a more flexible definition of ‚Äúunlawful means‚Äù was needed in the conspiracy context. In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada, favouring the ruling in OBG, standardized Canadian jurisprudence with respect to the \\"tort of unlawful interference with economic relations\\" (which it preferred to call \\"causing loss by unlawful means\\", or the \\"unlawful means tort\\"). In its ruling in A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd., it declared: #Liability to the plaintiff is based on (or parasitic upon) the defendant‚Äôs unlawful act against the third party. The two core components of the unlawful means tort are that the defendant must use unlawful means and that the defendant must intend to harm the plaintiff through the use of the unlawful means. #In order for conduct to constitute ‚Äúunlawful means‚Äù for this tort, the conduct must give rise to a civil cause of action by the third party or would do so if the third party had suffered loss as a result of that conduct. The unlawful means tort should be kept within narrow bounds, and it is not subject to principled exceptions. #The defendant must have the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff as an end in itself or the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff because it is a necessary means of achieving an end that serves some ulterior motive. #The focus of this tort is unlawful conduct that intentionally harms the plaintiff‚Äôs economic interests. There need be no contract or even other formal dealings between the plaintiff and the third party so long as the defendant‚Äôs conduct is unlawful and it intentionally harms the plaintiff‚Äôs economic interests. #The tort of unlawful means is available even if there is another cause of action available to the plaintiff against the defendant in relation to the alleged misconduct.

His friends liked the way he built them, and they asked him to build them one. This was technically the start of the boat company. He soon began to build more boats and joined his brother Hank in 1881 to begin producing boats full-time. In 1910, the brothers joined with other partners to form the Smith Ryan Boat Company. The firm's name was changed in 1922 to Chris Smith & Sons Boat Company, then to Chris-Craft in 1924. The Detroit-area company became well known for its sleek racing boats in the 1910s and 1920s. Chris-Craft sold high-end powerboats to wealthy patrons such as Henry Ford and William Randolph Hearst. In the late 1920s, Chris-Craft extended its market into the middle class when it became one of the first mass-producers of civilian pleasure boats. The company began assembly line production at their plant in Algonac, Michigan,Location of Chris-Craft Michigan factory dramatically lowering production costs. Formerly, most powerboats had been hand-built. Engines were supplied by both Ford and Chrysler, and by the Hercules Engine Company in later models.History of Hercules Engine Company In 1927, the company introduced the Cadet, an affordable 22' runabout. At the time, the domain of speedboats was largely confined to the wealthy. Its innovative advertising campaign promised a piece of \\"the good life\\" to the growing American middle class. The company sold its boats on the installment plan, making them among the first powerboats available to the general population. The Great Depression robbed many Americans of discretionary income, and Chris-Craft sales suffered. The company introduced a line of low-priced powerboats to stay solvent. By 1935, a 15.5' utility boat sold for as little as US$406. During World War II, the company produced small patrol boats and launches for the U.S. Navy. After the war, Chris-Craft introduced a new lineup of civilian pleasure boats in time for the massive American consumer expansion of the 1950s. That decade marked the height of company prestige, and the Chris-Craft brand name became virtually synonymous with pleasure boating. The company offered 159 different models, and it was the sales leader in many categories of small civilian powerboats. The company sold high-end boats to famous customers such as Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. Their boats were often made from the finest mahogany and were considered to be among the best available. They were easy to operate, a must for their \\"weekend sailor\\" owners. In some circles, owning a Chris-Craft was expected. Even their lower- priced boats were considered to be of high quality, often featuring such luxurious items as a liberal use of mahogany, teak, and brass. Chris-Craft manufactured its first fiberglass boat by 1955. The company added a metal boat division in 1957, designated as the Roamer Steel Boats Division (RSBD). This was founded upon its purchase of the Roamer Boat Company, and the boats became known as Chris Craft Roamers. The company was acquired by Shields & Company's NAFI Corporation in 1960 under which the company operated independently. Chris-Craft Industries sold its boat division to Murray Industries in 1981, while retaining the Chris-Craft trademark and licensed it to Murray. Outboard Marine Corporation acquired the boat company in 1989, then went into bankruptcy in 2000 and was purchased by Genmar Holdings. Genmar sold the Chris-Craft boat division to Stellican Ltd., then Stellican purchased the Chris-Craft trademark from News Corporation, thus reuniting the two parts of the boat company. In June 2018, Winnebago Industries Inc. acquired Chris Craft.{Cite newsurl=https://www.tradeonlytoday.com/post-type- feature/winnebago-acquires-chris-crafttitle=Winnebago acquires Chris- Craftdate=2018-06-27access-date=2020-08-12}} ReferencesExternal links Category:American boat builders Category:Defunct companies based in Michigan Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Michigan Category:1960 mergers and acquisitions Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1962 Category:1962 disestablishments in Michigan ","title":"Chris-Craft Boats"},{"id":"2278527","text":"Ringu (the Japanese romanization of ring) may refer to: *Ring (franchise) *Ring (novel series) *Ring (Suzuki novel) published in 1991 *Ring (film) the 1998 adaptation of the above novel *Ringu Ringu language ","title":"Ringu"},{"id":"2278532","text":"The year 1878 in archaeology involved some significant events.

It resulted in the destruction of nearly the entire Korean fleet. Background Prior to the battle, the previous naval commander Yi Sun-sin, had been removed from his post due to a Japanese plot. The less experienced Won Gyun was promoted in Yi's place. Won Gyun set sail for Busan on 17 August with the entire fleet, some 200 ships. Battle The Korean fleet arrived near Busan on 20 August in 1597. As the day was about to end, they met a force of 500 to 1,000 Japanese ships arrayed against them. Won Gyun ordered a general attack on the enemy armada, but the Japanese fell back, letting the Koreans pursue. After a few back and forth exchanges, with one chasing the other, one retreating, the Japanese turned around one last time, destroying 30 ships and scattering the Korean fleet. Won's men docked at Gadeok and ran ashore to find water where they were ambushed by 3,000 enemy troops under Shimazu Yoshihiro. They lost 400 men and several vessels. From Gadeok, Won retreated north and west into the strait between Geoje and the island of Chilchon, Chilchonnyang. Won Gyun then retired to his flagship and refused to see anyone. The entire fleet sat in the strait for an entire week. The Japanese commanders convened on 22 August to plan a joint assault on the Koreans. Shimazu Yoshihiro ferried 2,000 of his men to Geoje, where he arrayed them on the northwest coast, overlooking the Korean fleet below. On the night of 28 August, a Japanese fleet of 500 ships moved into the strait and attacked. By dawn, nearly all the Korean ships had been destroyed. Won Gyun fled to the mainland but could not keep up with his men. He sat down under a pine tree until the Japanese found him. It is assumed that his head was cut off. Yi Eokgi also died during the battle after drowning himself. Aftermath Prior to the destruction on 28 August, Bae Seol shifted 12 ships to an inlet farther down the strait and managed to escape. Bae Seol set fire to the camps at Hansando before the Japanese arrived. He then sailed west with the remaining 12 ships, all that was left of the Korean navy.

A Republican, he served two terms as the 9th Governor of Utah (1949-57), six 2-year terms as mayor of Price, Utah (1935-47), and three terms as the 27th mayor of Salt Lake City (1960-71). Lee was the most recent of three Governors of Utah who was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the other two being Simon Bamberger (1917‚Äì1921) and George Dern (1925‚Äì1933). Early years and personal life Lee was born in Price, to Arthur J. Lee (1870-1934) and Ida Mae (Leiter) Lee (1874‚Äì1980). When he was five, the family moved to Fruita, Colorado, where they remained until he was in the eighth grade. The family then returned to Price. During World War I, Lee served in the U.S. Army, lying about his age and passing up his high school graduation in order to enlist. During training in California, the Army kept him there as a trainer for the soldiers going to Europe, believing that he had the excellent people skills needed for this job. This was a decision that Lee initially regretted, as he wished to serve in combat. After the war, he joined his father in the insurance business in Price prior to going into politics. Lee married Nellie Pace. Their daughter, Helen (Nelson), was born in 1922 (died 2005). Two years later Nellie became seriously ill, first with pneumonia, and then with Hodgkin's disease, of which she died in 1926. The medical expenses placed Lee in considerable debt. Until the debts were paid, Lee moved into his own garage and rented out his house. Another way he tried to save money was by eating only one hamburger and drinking a quart of milk a day. During this time, his daughter lived with Lee's parents. This experience helped form his fiscal conservatism, as he vowed he would never go into debt again. On February 23, 1928, he married Margaret Draper (1909‚Äì1989) of Wellington, Utah. They had three children, a son, James (born 1930), a daughter, Jon (Taylor) (born 1935), and a son, Richard (1944-2012). Margaret fueled Lee's political ambition, encouraging his entry into politics and actively contributing to his career. Together, they made a formidable team. She had a remarkable memory for names, a skill helpful to Bracken in public life. Margaret was active in the Women's Literary Society. She also did historical research on prominent women in the West and gave speeches about them. Bracken and Margaret were married for 61 years, until her death in 1989. Lee was an avid hunter and outdoorsman, particularly enjoying the high desert in eastern Utah near Price. He played semi-professional baseball as a young man, playing shortstop. He was also an extraordinary handyman, with skills in jewelry making and painting. He was a member of the Freemasons, Shriners, and Elks. Lee died in Salt Lake City and is interred in a family plot at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Salt Lake City. Dying at 97 years of age, he lived longer than any other Utah Governor. Political career Lee was fiscally conservative and a deep opponent of the income tax. With hefty cuts in spending, he was able to run surpluses in all of his administrations. As governor, he trimmed both spending and bureaucracy by cutting the number of departments and commissioners. He particularly angered the teachers' union for his cuts in higher education. In addition to his fierce opposition to the income tax, he opposed foreign aid and the United Nations. While Lee was the descendant of Mormons, he had no religious affiliation himself, but still enjoyed political success despite the fact that he was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although he did not shy from criticism of the church, he was careful to maintain good diplomacy with its leadership. For a time Lee became involved in conservative anti-tax groups who advocated the formation of an independent third party because of the increasing liberalism of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Lee lost his first political campaign for mayor of Price in 1931. He returned in 1935 to win by just two votes, enjoying reelection another 5 times there. He lost two runs for governor in the 1940s before a successful bid in the fall of 1948. In 1956, he lost the Republican primary, which caused him to run a strong but unsuccessful race as an independent. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in both 1958 and 1962, and again for governor in 1964, though he was defeated in the Republican state convention. Under the political system at the time, if no candidate running for statewide office or House of Representatives got 80% of the delegate votes at the convention, a primary was held between the top two candidates. Lee came in third at the convention, which eliminated his candidacy. In 1960, he was the Conservative Party's nominee for President. His Running Mate was Kent Courtney. They came in 9th place by popular vote. Controversial firing of Police Chief Skousen W. Cleon Skousen had served as Salt Lake City, Utah, police chief for four years before being fired. Salt Lake City had a weak- mayor system, with the mayor being a member of the five member commission. In 1960 Lee offered a motion to fire Skousen and the majority of the commission voted yes.J.

Bracken Lee and the Firing of W. Cleon Skousen, Utah Historical Quarterly, Volume 42, No. 4, 1974, p. 316 article by Dennis L. Lythgoe Lee characterized Skousen's strict enforcement of anti-gambling laws as \\"like a Gestapo.\\"Organizations: The Ultras - TIMEThe Washington Monthly Lee's legacy Lee's biographer, Dennis Lythgoe, regards his greatest contribution his terms as mayor of Salt Lake City, where he brought fiscal responsibility and capital improvements to the city. With age having moderated his temper somewhat, he was more effective in office while remaining true to his principles. Lee's legacy as governor is sometimes disputed. While many point to his temper, opinionated personality, and battles with educators as problems, he is also generally praised for his fiscal responsibility, and for the fact that Utah enjoyed a prosperous economy during his administration. Throughout his entire tenure, the state had a surplus rather than debt. Even Lee's political opponents respected his integrity and honest, open and straightforward ways of dealing. Lee was often compared to President Harry S. Truman. Though the two had differing political viewpoints and were members of opposite parties, their personalities were similar. They shared folksy manners, never shied from stating their opinions, and were bluntly honest. With the two in office at the same time from 1949‚Äì1953, it was easy for many to compare the two.

The film stars Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Matthew Davis, Will Sanderson, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michael Par√©, Meat Loaf, Michelle Rodriguez, Ben Kingsley, and Geraldine Chaplin. The screenplay by Guinevere Turner is based on the video game of the same name from Majesco Entertainment and the game developer, Terminal Reality. The third video game film adaptation by Boll, who previously made the films based on House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne received extremely negative reviews upon release and was a box office bomb, grossing only $3.7 million from a $25 million budget. Plot Rayne is an unholy breed of human and vampire known as a dhampir. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood, but maintain a vampire weakness to holy water. She is the daughter of the Vampire King, Kagan, who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan raped her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her when she rejected his advances. Sebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, a group of warriors sworn to fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival when her keeper tries to rape her. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with him. Rayne sets out to the monastery where it is hidden to find it. Rayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk, who she kills. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it. When she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called Belial, who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water, the rib overcomes the cross, and the heart overcomes sunlight. When Belial died, the parts of his body were hidden across the land. As Kagan desires all these parts in order to assume Belial's powers, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him. Rayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone Society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne kills her and takes it. With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late that Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart. Sebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends, and Sebastian chooses to die rather than let Rayne save him. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne, and reflects on the events that led to her father's death. Rayne then leaves the castle and rides off into the mountains. CastProduction Screenwriter Guinevere Turner turned in the first draft two weeks late. Rather than asking for redrafts Boll accepted it and then made many of his own changes; and he then asked the actors to \\"take a crack at it\\". Turner estimated only 20% of her script was actually filmed. Filming took place in Romania, in the Carpathian Mountains. Filming also took place in a castle where Prince Vlad the Impaler presumably spent a night once. Reception On January 6, 2006, the film opened in 985 theaters across the United States. It was originally to have played at up to 2,500 theaters, but that number dropped to 1,600 and ended up lower due to prints being shipped to theaters that had not licensed the film. Billy Zane was involved with distributor Romar Entertainment and Uwe Boll later sued him for revenue owed. =Box office= In its opening, the film only made US$1,550,000.. The film ended up grossing US$3,591,980 (June 2006) against a production budget of US$25 million. =Critical response= BloodRayne was critically panned. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 4% approval rating based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 2.27/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"BloodRayne is an absurd sword-and-sorcery vid-game adaptation from schlock-maestro Uwe Boll, featuring a distinguished (and slumming) cast.\\" It was ranked 48th in Rotten Tomatoes's 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s. On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 18% based on 13 reviews, summarizing the reviews as \\"overwhelming dislike\\". CBS Joe Leydon of Variety said that the film \\"lurches from incident to incident at a graceless plodding place, offering little in the way of genuine excitement‚Äîthe swordfights often are confusingly cut and choreographed‚Äîand only minimal amounts of guilty-pleasure titillation.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide wrote: \\"Though indisputably the best of Uwe Boll's first three video-game-into-film adaptations, this gory, ludicrous horror-action picture isn't good by any standard.\\" Critics ridiculed Boll for hiring actual prostitutes instead of actors for a scene featuring Meat Loaf in order to save on production costs.\\"BloodRayne\\" Movie Review by Kevin Carr - 7M Pictures. UGO.com Film/TV Uwe Boll BloodRayne Interview Some critics were more forgiving of the film. Berge Garabedian of JoBlo's movie reviews described as the film as \\"actually pretty decent‚Ä¶ for what it is,\\" namely a video game adaptation, with a hot lead actress in the form of Kristanna Loken and a number of surprisingly fun and bloody action sequences. He acknowledges the dialog is poor and the story lame but says the film is \\"not as bad as you‚Äôd suspect\\" and an adequate, bloody, low-budget vampire film. Steve Chupnick of the Latino Review gave the film a B rating, saying that although it was not a good film, it was far from the worst he's seen and mentioned the Kristanna Loken nude scene as something in the film's favor. Rating B. Actor Michael Madsen called BloodRayne \\"an abomination... a horrifying and preposterous movie\\", but added that he enjoyed working with Boll and would certainly work with him again if asked. Laura Bailey, who was the voice of Rayne in the BloodRayne games, was asked at her panel at Anime Boston 2007 what her thoughts were on the film adaptation, and said, \\"Oh God, that movie sucked. And that movie was so bad. I saw it on The Movie Channel and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of it! It was so bad and it was kinda sad that they took that because I really liked the games.\\". Guinevere Turner who wrote the draft screenplay, found the film laughable and suggested that it was the \\"worst movie ever made\\" but that it was so camp it might ripen with age. =Accolades= The film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards including, Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Kristanna Loken), Worst Supporting Actor (Ben Kingsley), Worst Supporting Actress (Michelle Rodriguez), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. Bloodrayne did not win any, having been dominated by Basic Instinct 2 and Little Man with seven nominations each. At the 2006 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, it received nine nominations, trailing behind Zoom's ten, with four wins: Worst Picture, Worst Director (Boll), Worst Ensemble, and Least \\"Special\\" Special Effects. Its other nominations were for Worst Supporting Actor (Meatloaf Aday), Worst Supporting Actress (Rodriguez), Worst Screenplay, Most Annoying Fake Female Fake Accent (Rodriguez), and Least Scary Horror Movie. In 2009, Time listed the film #6 on their list of top ten worst video games movies.Full List The film was number one on GameTrailers countdown of the worst video game movies ever. The reviewers from GameTrailers said that \\"every actor is miscast, every wig is too fake, every sex scene is too inappropriate, and every action scene is too improvised.\\" Sequels In 2007, a sequel BloodRayne 2: Deliverance was made. Natassia Malthe replaced Loken in the lead role. Due to the poor box office of the first film, BloodRayne 2: Deliverance went direct-to-video instead. A third film, BloodRayne: The Third Reich was released in 2011. Malthe reprised her role as Rayne. Both sequels were directed by Uwe Boll. Michael Par√© appeared in all three films, but as different characters: Iancu, Pat Garrett, and Commandant Ekart Brand, respectively. Home media Before the DVD of this film was released, Boll removed the Romar name and logo from the credits and packaging of this film. As a result, Romar ceased distributing the film. Next to the R-rated version which was shown in cinemas, a more violent unrated director's cut which includes an extended ending was released on DVD. The director's cut DVD box set included a full copy of the BloodRayne 2 video game on the second DVD.

Introduced originally in 1992, he was then rebooted in 1996 after Acclaim Entertainment bought Valiant Comics. He was rebooted yet again by Valiant Entertainment, Inc. in 2012. An ageless master fighter with enhanced abilities, Gilad helps protect Earth and humanity from various threats over his long life, often using methods considered ruthless by others. The character is sometimes described as \\"the Fist and Steel of the Earth,\\" a warrior chosen by the planet itself. He is sometimes guided by the Geomancers, a long line of sorcerers in the Valiant Universe who are guided by the voice and will of Earth itself. In each version of his continuity, Gilad has two immortal brothers: Aram (who later takes the name Armstrong) and Ivar the Timewalker. Since the 2012 Valiant Universe reboot, Gilad also has an immortal sister: Vexana the War-Monger. In each version of his continuity, Gilad fights a perpetually reincarnating villain called the Immortal Enemy or the Last Enemy. In both the original continuity and the 2012 Valiant Entertainment reboot continuity, it is indicated that any children Gilad has may be fated to be psychopathic or remorseless killers. Publication history Gilad was introduced in Eternal Warrior, a 50-issue series published by Valiant Comics from 1992 to 1996. During this time, there were also two issues published of the supplementary mini-series Eternal Warrior Yearbook. The original creative team was co-creator Jim Shooter with artist John Dixon, followed by writers Kevin VanHook, Barry Windsor-Smith, Mark Moretti, and John Ostrander. The series followed Gilad's adventures, often having him encounter other Valiant heroes and villains such as Bloodshot, Master Darque, and the team of Archer & Armstrong. Issues often involved flashback scenes to different adventures Gilad experienced through history, later also showing his life centuries in the future. Throughout history, Gilad is often seen working alongside Geomancers, a long-line of sorcerers connected to Earth itself and who sometimes recruited others to help against great threats. His one recurring foe is the Immortal Enemy, a mortal who repeatedly reincarnates, recalls his past lives, and attempts evil again, always having one green eye and one brown eye. Originally, Eternal Warrior Volume 1 #1 introduces Gilad with only one immortal brother, Aram. The crossover story of Eternal Warrior Volume 1 #8 and Archer & Armstrong Volume 1 #8 then retroactively introduced Ivar as a third brother, the eldest, before he went on to star in his own series Timewalker, which then established that the father of the three men was a warrior called Vandal, who may have had unique qualities himself. Some fans have wondered if the immortal DC Comics villain Vandal Savage was an inspiration for Gilad, both due to the name being used for his father and because, like Gilad, Savage also has an enemy who repeatedly reincarnates in new bodies and retains knowledge of his past lives, the hero Immortal Man. Acclaim Entertainment bought Valiant comics in 1994, leading to a reboot of the Valiant characters. In 1997, the graphic novel series Eternal Warriors reintroduced Gilad, now also called \\"Warmaster.\\" He and his two brothers, the sons of Vikings named Mog and Nin, are collectively called the \\"Eternal Warriors\\" and share immortality with others over the centuries, creating the \\"Forever Family.\\" The series started with the 1997 graphic novel Eternal Warriors: Time and Treachery by writer Art Holcomb and artists Doug Wheatley and John Floyd. The series ended in 1998 after five more graphic novels. In chronological order, they were: Eternal Warriors: Digital Alchemy, Eternal Warriors: Archer & Armstong, Eternal Warriors: Blackworks, Eternal Warriors: Mog, and Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy. Acclaim Entertainment declared bankruptcy in 2007 and the newly created Valiant Entertainment, Inc. bought the rights to many characters including Gilad. After a successful relaunch of Valiant Comics in 2012, Valiant Entertainment teased a new Eternal Warrior series at the Baltimore Comic-Con in September 2012. Eternal Warrior (Volume 2) by writer Greg Pak and artist Trevor Hairsine debuted in September 2013, running for 8 issues. The series said Gilad and his brothers were given immortality by an advanced device, and that Gilad was chosen directly by the Earth to be a warrior serving alongside the Geomancers; if he refused this role, it would upset the balance of Earth and lead to suffering for humanity. The series also puts him in conflict with two of his own children.Eternal Warrior (Vol. 2) #1-3, 2013. Afterward, the 2014 mini-series Eternal Warrior: Days of Steel ran for 3 issues, written by Peter Milligan with art by Cary Nord and Brian Reber. In 2015, Valiant published the crossover mini-series Book of Death by Robert Venditti and Robert Gill, with art by Doug Braithwaite. The mini-series concluded with Gilad sacrificing his life to protect a child and the new Geomancer, with the Earth releasing him from his role and allowing him to rest. This was followed by Wrath of the Eternal Warrior in 2014, where Gilad leaves the afterlife and fights to return to Earth. The series was done by the creative team of Robert Venditti, Raul Allen, and Patricia Martin, ending after 14 issues in 2015. In 2017, Gilad appeared in the 25th anniversary one- shot comic Eternal Warrior: Awakening by Robert Venditti, Renato Guedes, and Ulisses Arreola. In 2019, Gilad appeared in the 4-issue mini-series Incursion written by Andy Diggle and Alex Paknadel with art by Doug Braithwaite Fictional character biography=Valiant Comics 1992‚Äì1996= Gilad Anni- Padda is born in a village of Anatolia in 3268 BC. He is the son of a warrior named Vandal, along with his older brother Ivar and younger brother Aram. After the death of their mother during Aram's birth, Ivar leaves the village in grief. Another tribe attacks the same day, forcing Vandal to flee with Gilad and Aram while the other villagers are killed. Adopting a new home, Gilad and Aram learn they are immortals with enhanced physical abilities (the same is true of Ivar, who learns he can also walk through time). In 3257 BC, at the age of eleven, Gilad emerges victorious from his first battle. One of the bravest of a warrior tribe, his aggression in battle leads some to say he possesses the \\"Leopard Spirit.\\" In 3219 BC, Gilad and Aram's adopted tribe battles the superior weaponry of the Mesopotamians. All of the tribe is killed with the exception of Gilad, Aram, and Gilad's first son Kalam, whose life is spared. Learning Kalam has been adopted by Mesopotamians, Gilad decides to let the mortal boy live his own life. He travels along a Geomancer sorcerer for a time, fighting threats when he must, while Aram spends his immortal life preferring to seek pleasure, adventure and drink.Eternal Warrior (Vol. 1) #1-3, 1992. Gilad leads many lives, usually keeping his first name whenever he adopts a new identity. Occasionally he fathers children, each of whom possesses great strength and better than average resiliency to injury, but each of whom is also said to eventually be \\"black of heart\\" or \\"psychopathic,\\" often leading Gilad to later kill them. Deciding this must be an inherent curse of his genetics, Gilad decides by the late 17th century to avoid fathering children again.Eternal Warrior Yearbook #2, 1994. Through many battles over thousands of years, he becomes a master at combat, military tactics, and stealth. This, combined with his enhanced strength, speed, reflexes, resiliency, and healing, all make him a formidable opponent against those he considers evil or too corrupt to live. Sometimes he works with the speakers of the Earth, the Geomancers (who consider him the \\"Fist and Steel\\" of the Earth), as well as alongside other heroes. In 210 BC, Gilad fights General Cheng. Though the villain dies, they reincarnate repeatedly throughout history, having many faces and lives, always recalling their past lives, always pursuing evil. This person of many identities becomes Gilad's \\"Immortal Enemy.\\" In every incarnation, the Immortal Enemy's eyes remain the same: one green and one brown. In 1695, Gilad fights alongside William III against the Immortal Enemy, who at this time is known as Victor II. Gilad kills him on the battlefield (although historically, Victor II died in bed in 1730) but the villain's soul then inhabits Gilad's own baby son who is born the next day. Over two decades later, Gilad kills his adult son, recognizing him as his foe, \\"the Reincarnator.\\" Gilad occasionally reunites with his brothers Aram and Ivar, and the three of them even inspire the story of The Three Musketeers.Eternal Warrior (Vol. 1) #8, 1993. Over time, Aram finds Gilad too coldhearted and ruthless, worrying the man considers his own judgment to have greater authority than others. Eventually, Aram takes on the name Armstrong, later becoming the guardian and assistant of a young man named Obadiah Archer. In the 20th century, Gilad becomes friends with the new Geomancer, a young man named Geoff. He makes an enemy of mob assassin Angelo Mortalli but then helps the man after Angelo loses his memory and is transformed into the warrior Bloodshot. Gilad decides not to hold a grudge, saying that Mortalli metaphorically \\"died\\" when Bloodshot was \\"born.\\" During the Unity crisis, Gilad meets a version of himself who lives in the 41st century and battles evil alongside the last Rai warrior and Magnus, Robot Fighter.Eternal Warrior #1-2 (1992) =Acclaim Entertainment 1997‚Äì1998= Long ago, the Viking warrior Mog has a wife Nin (a woman with one green eye and one brown eye) and three sons: Gilad, Ivar and Aram. Mog discovers a special herb he believes is connected to the gods. Calling it the Bloom, Mog shares it with their young sons, who begin growing rapidly and show increased physical abilities. Consuming the plant regularly, Mog gains a form of immortality and begins to hear voices he thinks are gods telling him it is his destiny to dominate Earth. When Nin shows concern for him, Mog decides she is jealous of his power and stabs her fatally. To save his mother, Ivar pushes her into the river where the Bloom plant was found. Mog destroys his village in a rage, then continues pursuing murder and conquest over the centuries. Eventually, he gains enough control over his rage to act clandestinely when he must. Nin, transformed by the Bloom, repeatedly confronts Mog, becoming his Immortal Enemy.Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy (1998) Reaching adulthood, Mog's sons realize they are ageless and nearly invulnerable. Working against threats to humanity, they become known as the Eternal Warriors. As the centuries go on, the three Eternal Warriors occasionally choose those they deem worthy to become immortal as well, sharing the Bloom with them. Those chosen become known as the Forever Family, and together they and mortal allies work in secret to fight evil and influence humanity for the better.Eternal Warriors: Archer & Armstrong (1997) Many of the Forever Family leave their old names behind, renaming themselves after weapons or items of significance. The three Eternal Warriors also earn individual titles among the Forever Family. Ivar, who discovers how to fold time and travel through the sub-dimension of \\"netherspace,\\" earns the title Timewalker. Aram, also nicknamed \\"the Mighty Arm-Strong,\\" becomes an Earth-based sorcerer known as a Geomancer. Gilad becomes known as Warmaster. Ivar later implies he was also the man called Judas Iscariot in the New Testament, and that he kept only one of the 30 pieces of silver as a reminder of the betrayal of Jesus of Nazareth.Eternal Warriors: Blackworks (1998) In the modern-day, the Eternal Warriors have a hidden community in the Palazzo base in Rome that includes the Forever Family, several human allies, and the Neo-Vals, the last surviving descendants of the original Vikings. One of their own betrays the other immortals, destroying their bodies so catastrophically they do not survive.Eternal Warriors: Time & Treachery (1997) This betrayal and the recent rise of superhumans and alien invaders lead Gilad to consider taking drastic action to protect humanity. He considers using a powerful \\"Harvest Device\\" to wipe out all life on the planet while he, the Forever Family, and their allies remain hidden and safe. Then they will emerge and restart society on Earth. Believing this plan is too extreme, Aram defies Gilad and disrupts the operation.Eternal Warriors: Archer & Armstrong (1997) The brothers eventually soon work together again against threats such as the corrupt organization Blackworks, whose leader Donald Kelvin discovers Mog. The father of the Eternal Warriors uses Blackworks resources to wage war, demanding leadership of the Forever Family and domination of Earth. To fight Mog, Ivar frees his imprisoned mother Nin. After several battles, Mog is defeated and the Eternal Warriors decide their efforts to help humanity have caused as much harm as good. They disband the Forever Family and go their separate ways.Eternal Warriors: The Immortal Enemy (1998) =Valiant Entertainment Reboot 2012= Six thousand years ago in the ancient Mesopotamian city-state of Ur, Gilad Anni-Prada is a normal man with two older brothers, Ivar the engineer and Aram \\"the strong,\\" and a younger sister Vexana. A fearsome warrior, Gilad spends time with wild beasts in order to learn their ways of hunting and killing. One day, the three brothers journey into the strange realm of Utnapishtim, also called \\"the Faraway.\\" During their quest, they meet the Keepers of the Timeless Word, an order that safeguards a machine known as the Boon which sustains life in the Faraway, keeping it a timeless place without death. They take the machine but Gilad is fatally wounded. Ivar and Aram return to Ur and Vexana is grief-stricken, leaving Gilad's deathbed and fleeing the city. Ivar believes the Boon can restore Gilad and activates it with Aram. The Boom drains the life force from the thousands who inhabit Ur and a massive explosion occurs, the Great Cataclysm. All those in Ur and the surrounding areas are killed, the city now in ruins. As a result, Gilad is not only resurrected, he and his two brothers are now immortals with enhanced bodies and minds (though the scars on Gilad's face remain). The three brothers eventually go their separate ways, with Ivar becoming the Timewalker and Aram later adopting the name Armstrong.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #0 Vexana is also killed by the blast but then resurrected by dark spirits that grant her immortality and the ability to warp emotions. Seeing her home destroyed, Vexana worries her survival means she might be responsible for the Great Cataclysm. She leaves, her grief blocking out much of her memory and warping her mind. She becomes the War-Monger, a self-styled \\"agent of chaos\\" sparking conflicts around the world. At times she comes into conflict with her brothers but does not recognize them. Gilad Anni-Padda becomes one of the greatest warriors on the planet. Over time, he regularly works with Earth's Geomancers who tell him of threats he must stop. While a Geomancer conveys the voice of the Earth and is \\"the Seer of Earth and Stone,\\" Gilad is the \\"Fist and Steel of the Earth\\" and together they serve the planet. The Geomancers insist that without Gilad's help, Earth will fall out of balance. At times, Gilad seemingly dies and has visions of the Earth speaking to him through avatars, telling him he cannot rest yet even if he wishes and must return to life.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #9. In Ancient Mesopotamia, Gilad leads his forces against cult followers of the death god Nergal. Gilad's daughter Xaran joins the battle. Against her father's wishes, and arguing that it is a weakness to not use the methods of their enemies, Xaran not only kills soldiers but also targets the cult's women and children as well. When her brother Mitu tries to stop her, Xaran kills him and then battles Gilad next, who seemingly kills her instead. Following this, Gilad continues to fight for the Earth alongside the Geomancers, but now has grave misgivings.Eternal Warrior #1-2. He lives a nomadic experience, more solitary than before, but occasionally makes allies and friends such as Aric of Dacia (now Romania), a Visigoth living in the Roman Empire in the 5th century. By the Middle Ages, Gilad wonders if his actions and battles have all been meaningless.Eternal Warrior: Days of Steel #1-3. On a few occasions, Gilad fights Vexana, neither recognizing each other.Unity #20. In 1130 in Iran, Gilad joins forces with his brother Armstrong against the Null, a cult that worships entropy and nothingness. Along with many warriors and agents, the Null has a living algorithm (\\"an ancient artificial intelligence\\") that infects the mind of a person, destroying their personality and using the host body to become a deadly agent. This entity that constantly infects new host bodies is called \\"the Immortal Enemy\\" by the story, though Gilad refers to it as \\"the Last Enemy.\\" Throughout the centuries, Gilad battles it many times, in many forms.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #7-9. When a Geomancer tells Gilad to kill a woman and her child because their lives will lead to a rise in evil, he refuses. Abdicating his post as the Fist and Steel of Earth, he decides he will choose his battles on his own terms.Eternal Warrior (Vol. 2) #1-2. Unit Y and Unity During World War I, Gilad becomes the leader of \\"Unit Y,\\" a task force made of British and American fighters that took on special missions deemed too risky or dangerous for standard military units. The other members of Unit Y included: Dell, Alpha, and Breaker. During the war, they fought War-Monger, imprisoning her in a sealed tomb (though an earthquake freed her twenty years later). With the exception of Gilad, the entire team lost their lives towards the end of the war, sacrificing themselves to stop a mustard gas weapon. After returning home, Gilad suggested that the Unit Y program not be abandoned and might be needed in the future. Later similar groups are known simply as the \\"Unity\\" team, and there is another group later called \\"United.\\"Unity #0, #20. Gilad continues fighting evil, working for MI-6 for a time to protect Alan Turing, and later attempting to protect JFK from assassination. When his brother Armstrong and the young warrior Obadiah Archer stop an evil cult called the Sect from reactivating the Boon, a Geomancer is killed in the process. Sensing the death, Gilad attempts to take vengeance on Archer and Armstrong before being convinced to stop by the new Geomancer. The group then joins forces against the Null and once again Gilad faces the Last Enemy.Archer & Armstrong Volume 2 #5- . After helping thwart the Null's plans, Gilad is visited by Xaran, still alive due to inheriting his immortality, and learns she serves the Earth in her own way. The two join forces against his son Mitu, who has become an immortal champion of Nergal. As a consequence of his abandoning the fight against evil, Gilad learns he will be forced to serve the Earth again in two thousand years to stop the final followers of Nergal. Gilad teams with his long-estranged brother Armstrong to stop the nihilistic cult called the Null. Later on, Gilad reluctantly joins forces with Toyo Harada to stop Aric of Dacia, now known as the armored warrior X-O Manowar, who has returned to Earth after being abducted and enslaved by aliens centuries ago. After a superhuman task force called Unity fails Aric, Gilad forms a new Unity team alongside Ninjak and Livewire. After reaching an understanding with X-O Manowar, they all become allies. Gilad, Ninjak, and Livewire continue working together as Unity to protect Earth from major threats, including aliens and War-Monger.Unity #1-11. Death and return The Unity team later attempts to stop the villain Master Darque from usurping the power of the Geomancer and becoming master of Earth. Gilad suffers serious physical damage to save an innocent child and help Tama, the new Geomancer. Darque is defeated and Tama tells Gilad the Earth releases him and he can rest now and not return if he wishes. Gilad dies.Book of Death 1-4. Gilad finds himself in an afterlife where he is united with his lost children from different ages, as well as a lost love of his. But after deciding that he cannot rest when he knows there are heroes still fighting to protect Earth, and once again believing his actions do make a difference, he leaves behind his loved ones and battles his way back to the land of the living.Wrath of the Eternal Warrior #1-14. He resumes his role as one of Earth's protectors. In the post-apocalyptic 41st century, Gilad (now known to some as the Eternal Emperor) stands guard over an agricultural village atop the ruins of Little Rock, Arkansas. Later leading people into battle against the new incarnation of the death cult of Nergal, he hopes their threat is finally ended and wants to live in peace with his community and granddaughter Caroline. But seeing Caroline and others showing interest in lost technology and weapons, he fears people will repeat the same mistakes that led to humanity's destruction.Eternal Warrior (Vol. 2) #5-8 (2014). In 4001 CE, a Rai warrior finds Gilad and recruits him in his efforts to free the current Geomancer from New Japan.Rai Volume 3 #11-12 (2015).  Powers and abilities  Like his siblings, Gilad is ageless, invulnerable to disease and poison. He has superhuman strength, is more resistant to injury than an average human, has enhanced reflexes and speed, and his body heals from injury and damage. His millennia of life has also made him a master of all combat and weaponry known to humanity. In the Acclaim Entertainment Comics continuity, immortals could still be killed by catastrophic injury, such as having most of their flesh and muscle destroyed, having their heads destroyed, or being bisected across the mid-section. Since 2012, the comics have said that a mysterious machine known as the Boon not only made Gilad and his brothers immortal and enhanced their bodies but also enhanced their mind. The three brothers now have minds with unlimited storage and analytical capacity, as well as perfect recall when necessary. Even if the brain is destroyed and must later regenerate, all memories and knowledge are retained. The Boon also equips the mind with a unique form of apathy, so that emotions do not play a prominent role in their thought processes (although they do still feel them). This makes them immune to depression and other forms of mental illness, allowing them to experience eternity without losing their sanity over time. In other media=Web series= Eternal Warrior appears in the web series Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe portrayed by John Morrison. =Film adaptation= In August 2017, Dave Bautista was announced to be in talks to play the Gilad the Eternal Warrior in a solo movie. The 2020 Bloodshot movie was meant to be the first of several films taking place in a shared Valiant Comics cinematic universe that would include characters such as Gilad. After largely poor reception to the film, and with many studio projects on hold or rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the status of an Eternal Warrior movie is unclear.The Verge: \\"Bloodshot never had a chance of starting a new cinematic universe\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Valiant Days, Valiant Nights - A Look Back at the Rise and Fall of Valiant, Newsarama, September 24, 2003 * http://www.valiantfan.com/valiant/valiantdays.asp Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:Comics by John Ostrander Category:Valiant Comics characters Category:Valiant Comics titles Category:Iraqi superheroes Category:Valiant Comics superheroes ","title":"Eternal Warrior"},{"id":"2278611","text":"Hierarchical structure of hair in the cortex and cuticle, highlighting the scale which defines fibrils. Fibrils (from the Latin fibra) are structural biological materials found in nearly all living organisms. Not to be confused with fibers or filaments, fibrils tend to have diameters ranging from 10-100 nanometers (whereas fibers are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have diameters approximately 10-50 nanometers in size). Fibrils are not usually found alone but rather are parts of greater hierarchical structures commonly found in biological systems. Due to the prevalence of fibrils in biological systems, their study is of great importance in the fields of microbiology, biomechanics, and materials science. Structure and mechanics Fibrils are composed of linear biopolymers, and are characterized by rod-like structures with high length-to-diameter ratios. Oftentimes, they spontaneously arrange into helical structures. In biomechanics problems, fibrils can be characterized as classical beams with a roughly circular cross-sectional area on the nanometer scale. As such, simple beam bending equations can be applied to calculate flexural strength of fibrils under ultra-low loading conditions. Like most biopolymers, stress-strain relationships of fibrils tend to show a characteristic toe-heel region before a linear, elastic region. Unlike biopolymers, fibrils do not behave like homogeneous materials, as yield strength has been shown to vary with volume, indicating structural dependencies. Differences in structure between fibrils of different origin is typically determined by x-ray diffraction. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to observe specific details on larger fibril species such as the characteristic 67 nm bands in collagen, but often is not fine enough to determine the full structure. Hydration has been shown to produce a noticeable effect in the mechanical properties of fibrillar materials. The presence of water has been shown to decrease the stiffness of collagen fibrils, as well as increase their rate of stress relaxation and strength. From a biological standpoint, water content acts as a toughening mechanism for fibril structures, allowing for higher energy absorption and greater straining capabilities. Fibrillogenesis Fibrillogenesis is the expansion of fine fibrils which is common in collagen fibers of connective tissue. The definite mechanisms of fibrillogenesis are still unknown, although many hypotheses resulting from basic research help discover many possible mechanisms. In early experiments, collagen I could be distilled from tissues and recombined into fibrils with controlling the solutions. Later studies help understand the composition and structure of binding sites on the collagen monomers. Collagen is synthesized as a soluble precursor, procollagen, which supports collagen self-assembly. Since collagen fibrils have almost 50 binding components in vivo, the definite requirement to generate fibrillogenesis in vivo is still cryptic. With acidic or saline solution, collagen can be extracted from tissues and rearrange into fibril by changing temperature or pH value. Experiments discovered attractive force between collagen monomers which helps the rearrangement. Collagen serves as a precursor, procollagen, in synthesizing reaction, which identifies self-polymerization of collagen. =Natural processes= There are over 30 collagens in nature that are similar in chemical composition but differ in terms of crystal structure. By far, collagen I and II are the most abundant. They initiatively form fibrils in vitro, while fibronectin, fibronectin-binding, collagen-binding integrins and collagen V are essential for collagen I forming and collagen XI for collagen II forming. Therefore, cellular mechanisms play key role in the protein self- assembly process. In animals=Collagen= Structure of Collagen I fibrils Collagen is the major structural protein outside cells in many connective tissues of animals. As the primary component of connective tissue, it has the largest amount among protein in mammals, occupying 25% to 35% of all protein content in the body. The fibrils in collagen are packed in a crimp structure. The stress/strain curve of collagen, such as tendon, can be subdivided into several regions. The region of small strains, \\"toe\\" region, corresponds to the removal of a macroscopic crimp, uncrimping, in the collagen fibrils, visible in light microscope. At larger strains, \\"heel\\" and \\"linear\\" region, there's no further structural change visible. Tropocollagen is the molecular component fiber, consisting of three left handed polypeptide chains (red, green, blue) coiled around each other, forming a right-handed triple helix. =Actin and myosin= Muscles contract and stretch via the steerable sliding/grasping of the myosin interacting with actin fibers. Actin consists of two polypeptides in a helix and myosin has a small heart-shaped structure, cross-bridge. The bind and unbind processes of cross-bridge attaching on actin filament help relative movement of these collagens and hence the whole muscle. = Elastin and keratin = Elastin is a fibrous protein common in various soft tissues, like skin, blood vessels and lung tissue. Each monomer connects with each other, forming a 3D network, with ability to endure over 200% strain before deformation. Keratin is a structural protein mainly found in hair, nails, hooves, horns, quills. Basically keratin is formed by polypeptide chains, which coil into Œ±-helices with sulfur cross-links or bond into Œ≤-sheets linked by hydrogen bonding. Œ≤-keratin, which is tougher than Œ±-conformation, is more common in birds and reptiles. =Resilin and spider silk= Resilin is an elastomeric insect protein, consisting of both Œ±-helices and Œ≤-sheets structure. It is one of the most resilient protein in nature. It has a low stiffness ~0.6MPa but a high energy restoring percentage ~98%, and efficiently helps flying insects to flap wings or fleas to jump. Spider silk fibril is composed of stiff crystallized Œ≤-sheets structure, responsible for strength, and amorphous matrix surrounding, improving toughness and elongation ability. It has exceptionally high tensile strength and ductility, with respectively low density, compared to other natural fibril. Its feature varies from different kinds of spider for different utility. In plants=Cellulose= Space fill model of cellulose, prior to winding into fibrils The primary cell wall derives its notable tensile strength from cellulose molecules, or long-chains of glucose residues stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Cellulose chains are observed to align in overlapping parallel arrays, with the similar polarity forming a cellulose microfibril. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Glycan molecules increase the complexity of the potential networks plant-based cellulose can configure itself into. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. Additionally, cellulose microfibrils also contribute to the shape of the plant via controlled-cell expansion. The stereoscopic arrangement of microfibrils in the cell wall create systems of turgor pressure which ultimately leads to cellular growth and expansion. Cellulose microfibrils are unique matrix macromolecules, in that they are assembled by cellulose synthase enzymes located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. It is believed that the plant can ‚Äúanticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils‚Äù by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules. =Amylose= Stirring of a given sample of amylose is said to form fibrillar crystals which are said to precipitate out of the mother liquor. These long fibrils can be imaged using electron microscopy revealing transverse striations resembling a shish-kebab. Amylose fibrils are categorized with having one of two morphologies: ones with small rodlike fibrils and others with lath-shaped crystals. =Wood= The fibrillar structure of wood is said to play a significant role in both the mechanical stability and ability of wood to possess channels to transport minerals and water. Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ¬± 0.6¬∞ rest angle, whereas latewood is said to have a transition region from 4.6¬∞ to 19.8 ¬± 0.7¬∞. In latewood, the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in ‚Äúolder‚Äù trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20¬∞ tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression. Biomimicry and fibrils= Self-cleaning properties = In order to mimic the strong adhesion, easy detachment, and self-cleaning properties of a gecko toe pad, a fibrillar-based adhesive can be created. These performance features stem from the underlying hierarchical structure which consists of a million microfibrils called setae which further consists of billions of nano-sized branches called spatulae. Mimicking this phenomenon involves four distinct design steps: # Making a vertically aligned micro-/nano- fibrillar arrays # Creating various tip shapes # Including anisotropic geometry # Building hierarchy. = A mature bone matrix = In order to mimic a mature bone matrix, self-assembled fibrils can be used to align a given mineral matrix. This is accomplished using a self- assembling molecule with a hydrophobic alkyl tail and a hydrophilic oligopeptide head. These molecules form micellar structures in situ, and disulfide bridges at low pH, leading to the formation and crystallization of 200 kDa polymeric nanofibrils. The mineral matrix ultimately interacts with the synthetic fibril via a phosphoserine residue which results in mineral nucleation and growth.

Life  Kahn was born in Mannheim, the second son of Bernhard Kahn:de:Bernhard Kahn and Emma Eberstadt. One of his seven siblings was the wealthy financier Otto Kahn whose son Roger Wolfe Kahn was a successful jazz musician, composer and aviator. His parents belonged to a distinguished family of bankers and merchants. In 1882, Kahn entered the K√∂niglichen Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin, where he studied for the next three years. Between 1885 and 1886, he continued his musical education under the tutelage of Josef Rheinberger in Munich. On a visit to Vienna the following year, Kahn met and befriended composer Johannes Brahms, who offered to make Kahn his pupil.see: Steffen Fahl, Tradition der Nat√ºrlichkeit, Studioverlag Sinzig, 1998 page 11-12 Although Kahn declined the invitation out of diffidence, Brahms's music would exert a profound influence on his compositional style throughout his career. After finishing his military service, Kahn worked as a freelance composer in Berlin until 1890. For the next three years he was employed as a Korrepetitor (rehearsal pianist) at the Stadttheater in Leipzig. Having been appointed lecturer in composition at his alma mater in 1894, Kahn was responsible for the training of some of the leading musical luminaries of 20th century classical music. Among his famous students were pianists Arthur Rubinstein and Wilhelm Kempff, the conductor Ferdinand Leitner, the composers Nikos Skalkottas and G√ºnter Raphael, as well as the violinist Karl Klinger. While Kahn was composing and teaching in Berlin he also was active as chamber musician and Lied accompanist in concert with leading soloists and singers of his time, ranging from Joseph Joachim and Richard M√ºhlfeld to Adolf Busch, from Johann Messchaert to Ilona Durigo and Emmy Destinn. In 1916, Kahn was elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts, a membership he held until 1934 when the Nazi regime ordered him to resign because he was a Jew. The Nazis also prohibited the publication and performance of his music. This drove him to leave Germany for England in 1938, where he spent the last years of his life in relative obscurity but inextinguishable creative power, which resulted in a voluminous collection of piano music with more than 1,000 still unpublished pieces. He died in Biddenden, Kent. Kahn and his music were almost entirely forgotten after World War II, but are slowly being rediscovered by musicians and audiences, as is the case of many other composers of \\"degenerate music\\" persecuted by the Nazis.  Works  Kahn composed prolifically for the chamber repertoire, writing in an intimate, lyrical style that is reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, and Johannes Brahms. Like his friend Brahms, Kahn eschewed the emotional extravagance of the late Romantics. His output included 2 piano quintets (besides the Quintet in C minor op.54 there is a Quintet in D Major from 1926), 2 string quartets, 3 piano quartets, 4 piano trios, 3 violin sonatas, 2 cello sonatas, several choral pieces, and numerous lieder. His only purely instrumental orchestral works were a serenade Aus der Jugendzeit (\\"From Youth\\") (1890) and a Konzertst√ºck for piano and orchestra in E-flat minor, Op. 74 (1920). Kahn was often commissioned to create works for some of the finest musicians of the early decades of the 20th century up to the young Adolf Busch with whom Kahn gave the first performance of his Suite op.69 for Violin and Piano. His first Violin Sonata in G minor was dedicated to Joseph Joachim who asked to perform it when Kahn was still a young student in Berlin, and even Clara Schumann mentioned this Sonata in her diary. The second Violin Sonata, in A minor, Op. 26 (1897) was dedicated to Joachim, while the String Quartet No. 1 in A major, Op. 8 (1889) was first performed by the Joachim Quartet. The second string quartet was premi√®red by the Klingler Quartet, the successor of the Joachim Quartet. Finally his clarinet trio op.45 was dedicated to and performed by the famous clarinetist Richard M√ºhlfeld who also inspired Brahms's late chamber compositions. Hans von B√ºlow conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the world premi√®re of Kahn's orchestral serenade.

Built on 1,850 dunams of land expropriated in 1991, it is considered an illegal Israeli settlement by much of the world,Israel Plans East Jerusalem Housing (New York Times, Nov. 8, 2010) although Israel disputes this. The settlement is also referred to as Jabal Abu Ghneim, which is the Arabic name of the hill. One purpose given for the decision approving of its establishment was to obstruct the growth of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.Judah Ari Gross, 'US officials: Washington could back UN resolution on Palestine,' The Times of Israel 19 March 2015:'the official referenced Netanyahu‚Äôs approval of construction in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa to block contiguity between Palestinian-majority areas during his first stint as prime minister in the 1990s as proof that Netanyahu truly meant what he said. ‚ÄúIt was a way of stopping Bethlehem from moving toward Jerusalem,‚Äù Netanyahu said at the time.‚Äú To actually come out and say that this construction is actually driven by efforts to undermine a future Palestinian state is fairly dramatic,‚Äù said the official.'Jody Rudoren, ‚ÄòNetanyahu Says No Palestinian State if He Is Re- Elected,‚Äô New York Times 16 March 2015.:‚Äô Mr. Netanyahu said he had authorized that construction during his first term to block Palestinians from expanding Bethlehem, and to prevent a ‚ÄúHamastan‚Äù for militants from sprouting in the hills nearby.‚Äô Har Homa has secular, traditional, and Modern Orthodox Jewish populations. The neighborhood was officially renamed Homat Shmuel in 1998 after Shmuel Meir, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, who played an active role in its development before he was killed in a car accident in 1996. In 2013, Har Homa had a population of 25,000.Homat Shmuel The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Map of the Gilo region/Har Homa History and name View of Har Homa In the 1940s, a Jewish group purchased 130 dunams (13 ha or 32 acres) of land on the hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim (, translit). During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the hill was a base for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a position taken over by Transjordan's Arab Legion. The Hebrew name \\"Har Homa\\", lit. \\"Hill (of the) Wall\\", refers to a wall built on the remains of a Byzantine church on the mountain which was visible to Palmach forces stationed at kibbutz Ramat Rachel. Following the war, the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property planted a small forest of non-native pine trees there to prevent misuse of the land by local Jordanian residents. After 1967, the forest was maintained by the Jewish National Fund until many of the trees were removed when the housing construction began in the late 1990s.History of Har Homa Start of the settlement Plans for residential development were drawn up in the 1980s, but were opposed by Israeli environmental groups working to preserve the open areas in Jerusalem. A primary aim was to complete the continuous Jewish encirclement in East Jerusalem by stopping a perceived 'hole' in this area, and thus hinder Palestinian development that would create linkage between Beit Sahour and Sur Baher.Amir Cheshin, Bill Hutman, Avi Melamed Separate and Unequal: The Inside Story of Israeli Rule in East Jerusalem, Harvard University Press, 1999 pp.57ff. In 1991, Israeli cabinet minister Yitzhak Moda'i approved expropriation of the land, which was owned by a variety of private owners, both Jewish and Arab, on the basis of eminent domain for new building projects conforming to a master plan. Both Jewish and Arab landowners protested the land seizures and appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, which denied their claims and ruled in favor of the government. The major landholder was David Meir, who then made an alliance with the Arabs whose land had been expropriated to block the development. Part of the original land is said also to have been owned by the Greek Orthodox Church and allegedly either sold or leased after severe pressure was applied by Israel on church authorities.Merav Mack,'Christian Palestinian Communities in Israel: Tensions between laity, clergy and state,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer (eds.), Sacred Space in Israel and Palestine: Religion and Politics, Routledge, 2013 pp.284-307 pp.293-294.;'One of the most contested cases in recent years was the alleged lease or sale of Abu Ghneim, owned by the Greek Orthodox Church, on which a large Jewish neighbourhood was established in 1997 known by the name of Har Homa. To illustrate the kind of pressure put on the patriarchs, according to Ruth Kark and Itamar Katz, the appointment of Patriarch Irineos 1 was \\"blocked\\" three times, \\"due to pressure exerted by government ministers and senior officials, municipal functionaries, businessmen, real-estate agents, financiers, building contractors, and international companies.' After the first land expropriations in 1995, Arab states brought the case before the UN Security Council. In May 1995, a draft resolution condemning Israel was vetoed by the US.Jabal Abu Ghneim & Ras Al- Amud . Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, 20 May 1999 Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres initially approved construction plans for Jewish homes on the site, but postponed the groundbreaking ceremony to avoid conflict with Palestinians who were seeking to overturn the decision in the Israeli courts.Boston Globe, 5/1/98 In July 1995, the government decided not to proceed with construction. On 19 February 1997, the newly elected Benjamin Netanyahu government approved the construction of the settlement.The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine ProblemPart V (1989 ‚Äì 2000), chap. III, E. CEIRPP, 2014. The Arab states again went to the Security Council. The General Assembly condemned Israel's actions, but two UNSC resolutions in March were again vetoed by the US. In March 1997, the Netanyahu government, which saw the construction of homes in Har Homa as a legitimate expansion of Jerusalem, eventually started the work. In March 2015, Netanyahu said that \\"we had to protect the southern gateway to Jerusalem by building here. There was huge objection, because this neighborhood is in a location which prevents the Palestinian (territorial) contiguity.\\" In October 2014, Netanyahu approved the construction of 400 additional units.PA on east Jerusalem building: Such unilateral acts will lead to an explosion - Retrieved 27 October 2014 According to ARIJ, Israel expropriated 354 dunams of land from Umm Tuba for Har Homa in 1997,Sur Bahir & Umm Tuba Town Profile, ARIJ, pp. 4, 14 while from 1997 onward, Israel expropriated hundreds of dunams of Beit Sahour land for the same purpose.Beit Sahour City Profile, ARIJ, p. 26 Institutions, organisations and infrastructure=Education= In 2013, Har Homa had 12 kindergartens, 6 day care centers, 5 elementary schools, and 4 youth movement centers (Bnei Akiva, Ezra, Ariel, and Beitar). There is no high school and students must take buses to reach nearby high schools in Gilo, Armon HaNatziv or other neighborhoods. =Health, shopping, transportation= In 2013, Har Homa had 3 medical clinics and 3 shopping centers. Egged bus lines connect Har Homa to downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, the Malha Mall and Ramot. Although many residents work in central Jerusalem, there is also an express bus to Tel Aviv for those who work outside of Jerusalem's environs. Controversy Typical architecture in Har Homa Israeli officials acknowledged that some Palestinian land was expropriated for the Har Homa neighborhood, but said that nearly 80% of the land taken for the project belonged to Jews.Tense standoff in Jerusalem ends. New York Times, 1 March 1997 According to FMEP, Israelis own approximately 75% of the land. One- third of it was purchased before 1948, and the remainder during the occupation after 1967. Palestinians owned approximately 33% of the planning area.Har Homa at a Glance . Settlement Report, Vol. 7 No. 3; May‚ÄìJune 1997; Foundation for Middle East Peace Israel said that Har Homa is within Jerusalem, and construction work does not constitute a change in the status of Jerusalem, in accordance with the Oslo Accords.Har Homa, Legal Aspects. Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 3 March 1997 Furthermore, the land was unoccupied and undeveloped prior to the current construction; both Jewish and Arab landholders were compensated for the land; and residents of Beit Sahour would not be able to develop the land in any event as the Oslo agreements specifically barred Palestinian jurisdiction over Jerusalem for the time being, and also excluded settlements as an issue, leaving it for permanent status negotiations. Residents of Beit Sahour, in conjunction with Israeli peace activists, campaigned against the decision to build Har Homa neighborhood, setting up what they called an \\"international peace camp\\" at the site. Most of the residents of Har Homa today are young families who moved there in search of affordable housing. When the Jerusalem municipality approved the initial 2,500 housing units in Har Homa, it also approved 3,000 housing units and 400 government-financed housing units in the Arab neighborhood of Sur Baher, which faces Har Homa. The plans were drawn up in 1994, but the approval process was stepped up in May 1997 as a counterbalance to Jewish development at Har Homa.Jerusalem Post, 5/23/97 Palestinian officials dismissed the project as a ploy aimed at deflecting international criticism.Baltimore Sun, 5/23/97 After failing to stop the development of the site, the residents of Beit Sahour have petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to return the undeveloped land between Beit Sahour and Har Homa to the Palestinian municipality, and to move the security fence to reflect their ownership of this land. Views=Palestinian= Palestinians have for a long time thought that Israel attempted to tighten their control over Jerusalem by constructing Har Homa. =U.S. administration= In 1997, the U.S. vetoed two UN Security Council resolutions that called on Israel to stop construction work. The U.S. was the only country of the 15 members on the council to vote against the resolution.(Jerusalem Post, 3/9/97) In a vote of 134 to 3, the United States, along with Israel and Micronesia, were the only countries among the 185 members in the UN General Assembly to vote against an April 1997 resolution demanding an immediate halt to construction at Har Homa. The previous month, a similar resolution condemning Israeli activity at Har Homa was passed 130 to 2, with only the U.S. and Israel voting against it.(The Times, 4/26/97) While the United States has traditionally refrained from describing Jerusalem neighborhoods as settlements, in 2008, then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was critical of building tenders in Har Homa announced after the Annapolis Conference meeting. She described Har Homa as \\"a settlement the United States has opposed from the very beginning\\". In November 2010, the United States criticized Israeli plans to build new housing units in Har Homa.US slams approval of 1,345 new east J'lem homes (Jerusalem Post, Nov. 8, 2010) =European Union= In 2011, then EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she was disappointed to hear that Israel was planning to expand Har Homa. She said in a statement that \\"the European Union has repeatedly urged the government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem (...)

Jane Arden was an internationally syndicated daily newspaper comic strip which ran from November 26, 1928 to January 20, 1968. The title character was the original \\"spunky girl reporter,\\" actively seeking to infiltrate and expose criminal activity rather than just report on its consequences and served as a prototype for later characters such as Superman supporting character Lois Lane and fellow comic strip heroine Brenda Starr, Reporter. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mary McGrory credited Jane Arden with instilling her interest in journalism. Jane Arden was only moderately successful in the United States, but it was highly popular in Canada and Australia. The strip was widely reprinted in comic books and was also adapted into both a film and a radio series.  Publication history  Jane Arden was created by writer Monte Barrett and artist Frank Ellis for the Register and Tribune Syndicate. Barrett wrote the strip until his death in 1949, and his stories were used until 1952 when Walt Graham assumed the scripting duties. Ellis was one of five artists to draw Jane Arden over its 41-year run. The work of Ellis' replacement, Russell E. Ross, is perhaps most identified with the character, as he drew the strip for 20 years. During the strip's last few years, under creator Bob Schoenke, it was combined with another Register and Tribune strip, Laredo Crockett, to become Laredo and Jane Arden (from 1964‚Äì1968).Schoenke profile, Who's Who of American Comic Book Artists, 1928‚Äì1999.

It was during this period that the strip first included Jane Arden paper dolls and accompanying outfits. Jane Arden was one of the first comic strip characters to become involved in World War II. Immediately after the outbreak of war in Europe, Barrett and Ross scrapped their current storylines and gave her a war assignment in the fictional neutral kingdom of Anderia (September 25, 1939).

Overview Prussian scout patrols were in Malacky on 19 July 1866, and in two days the Prussian army occupied Stomfa (Stupava). At that time it was evident that a cease fire would soon be negotiated, and so the Prussian General Eduard von Fransecky received the command to occupy Pressburg (Bratislava). The road from Stomfa to Pressburg ran through a valley in the Little Carpathians. High mountains rise alongside the road at this point, making it an easily defensible point. The commander of the Austrian troops in Pressburg Archduke Albrecht had located one brigade there under the command of Colonel Mondela on 18 July. Colonel Mondela placed the right wing of the brigade between Hrub√Ω Ple≈° and Leskara and the railway embankment, which protected the greater part of Mondela's brigade. The left wing was on the eastern and northeastern hillsides of Dev√≠nska Kobyla. The Austrian artillery was located near Lamaƒç and D√∫bravka, from which point it was able to control the road from Stomfa to Pressburg. The brigade was reinforced on 19‚Äì21 July by the arrival of the 9th Austrian mountain regiment. On Sunday, the morning of 22 July, the Prussian army began the attack on Lamacs. The second part, under the command of Major-General Bose, moved ahead through over Kamz√≠k hill to surround the Austrian defence and occupy Bratislava. About half past six, the first shot was fired from the Austrian cannon. Prussian forces were warded off and around 8 o'clock they got General Eduard von Fransecky's message: a cease fire was in effect and would take effect at 12 o'clock, only five hours later. The Prussian General had mounted a large number of artillery pieces, so an artillery duel had already begun. The result was large fires in Lamaƒç and D√∫bravka. The Prussian forces were warded off, despite their superior numbers. The battle's success depended on a flanking manoeuvre of Major-General Bose. The brigade moved slowly over the difficult terrain and the ceasefire was already in effect when they arrived at Kamz√≠k. By the setting of a line of demarcation, which overshot by Z√°horsk√° Bystrica, the Austro-Prussian war terminated the fights for domination over Germany and central Europe.

Pastoral counselors often integrate modern psychological thought and method with traditional religious training in an effort to address psychospiritual issues in addition to the traditional spectrum of counseling services. Distinctiveness \\"What distinguishes pastoral counseling from other forms of counseling and psychotherapy is the role and accountability of the counselor and his or her understanding and expression of the pastoral relationship. Pastoral counselors are representatives of the central images of life and its meaning affirmed by their religious communities. Thus pastoral counseling offers a relationship to that understanding of life and faith. Pastoral counseling uses both psychological and theological resources to deepen its understanding of the pastoral relationship.\\"David G. Benner, Strategic Pastoral Counseling: A Short-Term Structured Model (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2003.) . Membership in several organizations that combine theology and mental health has grown in recent years. Some pastoral counselors have developed special training programs to encourage cooperation between religious professionals and medical professionals on treatment of issues like addiction, since spirituality is an important part of recovery for many people. History Pastoral counseling had its beginnings a separate discipline in North America in the first half of the twentieth century, as various religious organizations began to incorporate the insights and training of psychiatry, psychology and social work into the training of clergy. In 1925, Dr. Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct at Harvard Divinity School, published an article in the Survey Graphic suggesting that every candidate for the ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students. reprinted online at the Canadian Association for Pastoral Education and Practice website In the 1930s, the Rev. Anton Boisen began a program of placing theological students in supervised contact with mental patients. In time, many seminaries and other training programs for religious professionals began to include clinical pastoral education as part of clerical training. Also in the 1930s, the minister Norman Vincent Peale and the psychiatrist, Dr. Smiley Blanton, collaborated to form the American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, now known as the Blanton-Peale Institute. Today, hundreds of mental health centers with links to specific religious traditions may be found across North America. In 1963, the American Association of Pastoral Counselors was founded to provide professional certification for pastoral counselors and pastoral counseling centers.American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History See also * Christian counseling * Nouthetic counseling ReferencesFurther reading * External links * * Category:Religious occupations Category:Practical theology Category:Counseling ","title":"Pastoral counseling"},{"id":"2278688","text":"Whiteshill is a village in the Cotswolds, situated between Stroud and Gloucester, in Gloucestershire, England.

Cole was associated with the magazine for 40 years as a pioneer craftsman of wood engraving. He immediately attracted attention by his unusual facility and his sympathetic interpretation of illustrations and pictures, and his publishers sent him abroad in 1883 to engrave a set of blocks after the old masters in the European galleries. These achieved for him a brilliant success. His reproductions of Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Flemish and English pictures were published in book form with appreciative notes by the engraver himself. Old Dutch and Flemish Masters was one of the books that Cole had contributed his wood engravings. Though the advent of new mechanical processes had rendered wood engraving almost a lost art and left practically no demand for the work of such craftsmen, Mr Cole was thus enabled to continue his work, and became one of the foremost contemporary masters of wood engraving. He received a medal of the first class at the Paris Exhibition of 1900, and the only grand prize given for wood engraving at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St Louis, Missouri, in 1904. In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1908.

Early life and education Qin was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, in 1907. In his earlier years, Qin studied at the Suzhou Industrial School where he took an active role in activities against imperialism and the warlords tyrannizing China. In 1925 Qin entered Shanghai University, a university that was known for its impact on young revolutionists at the time. The ideas of Marxism and Leninism were taught there by early leaders of the Chinese Communist party like Qu Qiubai and Deng Zhongxia. Qin showed a great interest in these teachings. Later that year, Qin joined the May 30th Movement which called for protests and boycotts against imperialism. This was a precursor to his involvement in the CPC. In 1926 Qin was sent to the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, Russia where he continued to study both Marxism and Leninism. The Sun Yat-sen University was established under Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen's alliance policy with the Soviet Union and the CPC. Its aim was to systematically train young revolutionists for Chinese revolution in the Russian fashion. Using the alias \\"Bo Gu\\", which means \\"familiar with histories\\" in Chinese, Qin continued his studies while becoming acquainted with Wang Ming, a student who had come to the university a year earlier. Wang and Qin, along with many other students, such as Zhang Wentian, Wang Jiaxiang, and Yang Shangkun formed a group known as the 28 Bolsheviks. They regarded themselves as orthodox Marxists, destined to take charge of Chinese revolution. Furthermore, with Wang's connection to Sun Yat-sen University's vice president and future vice minister of the Eastern Department of Comintern, Pavel Mif, the 28 Bolsheviks gained influence. One example being their role as missionaries and interpreters for the 6th National Congress of the CPC held in Moscow, with chances to comment on Chinese affairs. Early involvement with the Chinese Communist Party With Mif succeeding Radek as president, his prot√©g√©s, among them Bo Gu, were sent back to take charge of CPC. However, because of their inexperience in relation to veteran members such as Zhou Enlai and Zhang Guotao, the group was assigned to insignificant work. Then with the direct support from Mif, who came to China as envoy of Comintern, in the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of CPC in 1931 Wang and his associates won the battle with Li Lisan, who was incumbent paramount leader of CPC at that time, and Li's opponents of old CPC members, such as Labor activists He Mengxiong and Lin Yuying. Wang was appointed as member of politburo of CPC, with Mif took charge of CPC headquarter, Wang became the No1 in practice. As a reward, Bo Gu was appointed to be placed in charge of CY. When Wang returned Moscow for medical treatment, Qin was promoted to become a member of the Central Bureau of CPC, and then to be the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in charge of daily work of CPC. Under the policy of extremism and leftism of Li and Wang, CPC suffered great loss in their power struggle with KMT in cities. In 1933 Bo Gu and other members of the Central Bureau such as Zhou Enlai had to evacuate to Soviet Territory, which was the power base set up by CPC, in the countryside, in Jiangxi. Bo Gu, Zhou and Otto Braun, the military advisor from Comintern, found a military command team to replace Mao Zedong's control over the military, who was chairman of the Chinese Soviet Government at that time. Due to a change in Nationalist tactics, the CPC Red Army suffered great losses in Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Suppression against them. Bo Gu and his team had to launch a strategic diversion. During the Long March, the Red Army suffered heavy casualties from time to time, due to no plan and incompetence of command of the three-man leadership team. Especially, when the Red Army crossed the Xiang River, the Red Army was near a rat trap, and half of its elites were annihilated by the KMT army. Discontent and fury over the three-man leadership team increased. Under these circumstances, Mao used his diplomatic skills to communicate with Wang Jiaxiang, General Commissar of Red Army at that time, and got support from most of the generals that once had been loyal to him. Then in January 1935 came the convening of Zunyi Conference, and with the defection of 28 Bolsheviks members Zhang Wentian, Wang Jiaxiang and Yang Shangkun to Mao's camp, the three-man team's command over military was discharged, Mao, Wang and Zhou Enlai composed a new three-man team to replace them; and Bo Gu's title of General Secretary was replaced by his former associate Zhang, but he remained a member of the politburo. =Time in the Army= When Bo Gu reached Yan'an with the Red Army, he was still a young man, longing for a bright future of Chinese revolution. In order to make a clear distinction from his past, Bo Gu preferred others called him by his real name Qin instead of his alias. Mao still needed Gu and others of the 28 Bolsheviks such as Zhang Wentian and Wang Jiaxiang for their support in Mao's later power struggle with Wang Ming and Zhang Guotao, and thus Mao gave them some important assignments from time to time. For example, Qin was appointed as representative of CPC with Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying, and went to Xi'an to handle the Xi'an Incident in 1936, making a contribution for the establishment of United Front against Japan. In 1937 Qin was appointed as Minister of Organization Department of CPC, which was in charge of CPC cadres' promotion and nomination. In 1938 he was the Minister of Organization Department of Yangtze River and then Southern China Division of CPC. In 1941 he was appointed as head of Jie Fang Daily and Xinhua News Agency. Qin showed great enthusiasm in promoting the newspaper and exercised his best endeavor to make it a mouthpiece of CPC. Qin pledged his allegiance to Mao in Mao's struggle with Zhang Guotao, and in Cheng Feng he criticized his former close friend Wang Ming. But Qin still could not obtain favor from Mao and he had suffered greatly from stress and humiliation. His kindness and leniency towards the Cheng Feng movement by the newspaper under his direction received heavy criticism from Mao and his secret police boss Kang Sheng. They regarded Qin's action being inefficient and too merciful. As a result, although Qin was elected as Commissioner of the Central Committee of CPC in the 7th National Congress of CPC in 1945, he was listed as the last one. After the end of World War II in 1945, Mao was invited by Chiang to Chongqing for peace negotiation in order to avoid civil war between CPC and KMT. Qin was one of the delegates of the CPC with Mao, which indicated his appealing to Mao and his prominence in the CPC. Qin attended the following Political Consulting Congress held in Chongqing as delegate of CPC in Feb 1946. When Qin was on his way back to Yan'an, he died in an airplane crash in Shanxi. Among the other victims were several senior CPC leaders such as General Ye Ting, secret police boss Deng Fa, and old CPC member Wang Ruofei (ÁéãËã•È£û).

Coventry was son of John Coventry (died 1652), the second son of lord keeper Thomas Coventry of Croome Park, Worcestershire. Between 1655 and 1659, he travelled on the continent with his tutor the poet Edward Sherburne. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1660 and was made a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II, the following year. In 1667, he went with his uncle Henry Coventry to the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda, ending the Second Anglo-Dutch War. That year and in the following parliaments of 1678, 1679 and 1681, he was elected for Weymouth.History of Parliament Online - Coventry, John He followed Lord Ashley in politics, and was a fairly active member. On 21 December 1670, owing to a jest made by Coventry in the House of Commons on the subject of the King's amours, Sir Thomas Sandys, an officer of the guards, with other accomplices, by the order of Monmouth, and (it was said) with the approval of the king himself, waylaid him as he was returning home to Suffolk Street and slit his nose to the bone. The outrage created an extraordinary sensation in the Commons, and in consequence Parliament debated a bill ‚Äòto prevent malicious maiming and wounding‚Äô (22 & 23 Chas. II, c.1), a measure known as the \\"Coventry Act\\" was passed, declaring assaults accompanied by personal mutilation a felony without benefit of clergy, an Act not repealed until 1828. Sir William Coventry, his uncle, speaks slightingly of him, ridicules his vanity and wishes him out of the House of Commons to be out of harm's way. The character of Amnon in John Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel (1681) is thought to be based on him. He was suspected of having become a Roman Catholic while abroad in the 1650s and evidently was when he made his will in 1667. However, during the Exclusion Crisis, he sided with the party seeking the exclusion of the Duke of York from the king's presence. He died unmarried.

The preferred name[by whom?] for the group is Fare-Fare. The adopted name Frafra is a corruption from colonial times of the greeting \\"Ya fara-fara?\\" which means \\"How is your suffering [work]?\\" It may carry pejorative overtones in local usage. Frafra-language speakers number approximately 300,000. The larger group of Gurunsi people inhabit southern Burkina Faso and northern Ghana.  Geography  Bolgatanga is the commercial center of the Frafra area. Other important villages and towns include Bongo, Zuarungu, Zoko, and Pwalugu. Tongo is the principal town of the Talensi people, who are ethnically distinct from the Frafra, but most of whom are bilingual in the Frafra language. History The Frafra share a common history, language and political structure. Most Gurunsi live in Burkina Faso, and the degree to which Frafra history differs from their northerly neighbors, such as the Nuna, Bwa, and Winiama, is linked to their abode in Ghana. These differences arose during colonial times, as French and British colonial systems differed. Society=Economy= Frafra are primarily farmers, growing millet, sorghum and yams. Maize, rice, peanuts, and beans are grown in addition. Farmers throughout the region traditionally practiced slash-and-burn farming, using fields for approximately seven or eight years before they were allowed to lie fallow for at least a decade. In family fields close to villages, women grow cash crops for sale in local markets, including sesame and tobacco,. Men participate in hunting during the long dry season. This is important for ritual reasons since it is during this time that men interact with the spirits that inhabit the bush. During the dry season, when food supplies are running low, some fishing is practiced in local swamps. Increasing population-pressure has led to a shortening of fallow-times and a much smaller interval for hunting. Little bushland is available for slash-and-burn methods and the clearing of new farms. =Political system= Frafra societies are mainly without social or political stratification. They are not divided among occupational castes or groups since most of them hunt and farm. They had no system of chiefs, and all important decisions were made by a council of elders consisting of the oldest members of each lineage. Religious leaders hold some political authority, determining the agricultural cycle and parceling out land for cultivation. Culture=Religion= Belief in a supreme creator is central to Frafra beliefs. A shrine to this god occupies the center of every village. Each extended family maintains its own house, in which magical lineage objects are kept. The objects allow the family to maintain contact with the vital forces of nature. These objects are inherited by descendants and are the communal property of the lineage, providing protection and social cohesion among all members of the family. =Art and literature = The most recognized of the Frafra art forms are cast brass jewelry and decorated architecture. In addition, anthropomorphic figures sculpted from clay and wood and various personal objects, ranging from jewelry to wooden stools, are created to honor the spirits. A body of Frafra literature is emerging. A. Pamzoya first wrote a novel on Frafra culture called Souvenir for Death. Intellectual Agaysika Agambila gathered a collection of Frafra folktales under the title Solma: Tales from Northern Ghana. This was followed by Journey, a novel set in the Frafra area. Frafra peoples have a special, joking relationship with the Dagaare people of northwestern Ghana, which has its roots in an asserted common ancestry.

Damour, a Maronite Christian town on the main highway south of Beirut, was attacked by Lebanese Muslim and left-wing militants of the Lebanese National Movement with help from Palestine Liberation Organisation units. Many of its people died in battle or in the massacre that followed, and the others were forced to flee.Armies in Lebanon, 1985, Osprey Publishing Background The Damour massacre was a response to the Karantina massacre of January 18, 1976 in which Phalangists, a predominantly-Christian right-wing militia, killed 1,000 to 1,500 people.Noam Chomsky, Edward W. Said (1999) Fateful Triangle: The United States, Israel, and the Palestinians South End Press, pp 184‚Äì185 The Ahrar and the Phalangist militias, based in Damour, and Dayr al Nama had blocked the coastal road leading to southern Lebanon and the Chouf, which turned them into a threat to the PLO and its leftist and nationalist allies in the Lebanese Civil War.Yezid Sayigh (1999) Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement, 1949‚Äì1993 Oxford University Press, p 368 That occurred as part of a series of events during the Lebanese Civil War in which Palestinians joined the Muslim forces, in the context of the Christian-Muslim divide, and soon Beirut was divided along the Green Line, with Christian enclaves to the east and Muslims to the west. On 9 January, the PLO began a siege of Damour and Jiyeh. Jiyeh was entered by the PLO on 17 January. It was said that Yasser Arafat wanted to execute the local PLO commanders for what they had permitted.Fisk, 2001, pp. 99, Events Twenty Phalangist militiamen were executed, and civilians were lined up against a wall and sprayed with machine-gun fire.Fisk, 2001, pp. 99‚Äì100.

After the Battle of Tel al-Zaatar later that year, the PLO resettled Palestinian refugees in Damour. After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the Zaatar refugees were expelled from Damour and the original inhabitants brought back. According to Thomas L. Friedman, the Phalangist Damouri Brigade, which carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre during the 1982 Lebanon War, sought revenge not only for the assassination of Bachir Gemayel but also for what he describes as past killings of their own people by Palestinians, including those at Damour.Friedman, 1998, p. 161.Friedman, New York Times, Sep 20, 21, 26, 27, 1982. According to an eyewitness, the attack took place from the mountain behind the town. \\"It was an apocalypse,\\" said Father Mansour Labaky, a Christian Maronite priest who survived the massacre. \\"They were coming, thousands and thousands, shouting 'Allahu Akbar! (God is great!)

Francesca Bertini (born Elena Seracini Vitiello; 5 January 1892Other sources say 1888 ‚Äì 13 October 1985) was an Italian silent film actress. She was one of the most successful silent film stars in the first quarter of the twentieth-century. Biography Born in Florence, she was daughter of a woman who may have been an actress, but she was unmarried and Bertini was registered as Elena Taddei at an orphanage in 1892. Her mother, Adelina di Venanzio Fratiglioni, married Arturo Vitiello in 1910 and she took his family name. Bertini began performing on stages at the age of seventeen she began to perform in the just-born Italian movie production. She had a major role in Salvatore Di Giacomo's melodramatic story ‚ÄúAssunta Spina‚Äù. She had made over 50 films by 1915 including, Histoire d'un pierrot, was under the direction of Baldassarre Negroni in 1913. Gradually she developed her beauty and elegance, plus a strong, intense, and charming personality, which would be the key of her success as a silent movie actress. With Assunta Spina in 1915 she took care of the scripts as well as performing the role of the main character. Bertini was to claim with some support that she was the true director of the film which included novel acting techniques. She was one of the first film actresses to focus on reality, rather than on a dramatic stereotype, an anticipation of Neorealistic canons. The expression of authentic feelings was the key of her success through many films. She could perform with success the languid decadent heroine as well as the popular common woman. Other important roles were Odette, Fedora, Tosca and the Lady of the Camellias. In 1920https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d90PnIUlCHA, Fox Film Corporation in Hollywood offered to sign a contract with her, but she refused: she was married to the wealthy Swiss banker Paul Cartier and wanted to move with him to Switzerland. When her husband died, she moved back to Rome, where she would remain until her death. She stepped into sound movies as well, but in the meantime the Italian cinema had changed greatly (the period of Telefoni bianchi comedies) and entered into a period of crisis with Fascism and censorship. It experienced a definite hiatus with World War II.

He is the vain, pompous steward of Olivia's household. He is portrayed as the main antagonist. Style In the play, Malvolio is defined as a kind of Puritan. He despises all manner of fun and games, and wishes his world to be completely free of human sin, yet he behaves very foolishly against his stoic nature when he believes that Olivia loves him. This leads to major conflicts with characters such as Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Maria, mistress of the household. Much of the play's humour comes from Maria, Feste, Toby Belch, and Andrew Aguecheek tormenting Malvolio with drinking, joking, and singing. Later in the play, Maria devises a way to have revenge upon Malvolio, and proposes it to Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Feste. Maria composes a love letter in Olivia's handwriting, and leaves it so Malvolio will find it. Beforehand, Malvolio had been wishing to marry Olivia. The letter convinces Malvolio that Olivia loves him, and leads Malvolio to think that Olivia wishes him to smile, wear yellow stockings and cross garters. Olivia is in mourning for her brother's death, and finds smiling offensive, and yellow is \\"a colour she abhors, and cross garters a fashion she detests\\", according to Maria. When Malvolio is imprisoned for being a supposed lunatic after acting out the instructions in the letter, Feste visits him both as himself and in the guise of \\"Sir Topas the curate\\", and torments Malvolio by making him swear to heretical texts, for example, Pythagorean precepts. At the end of the play he vows, \\"I‚Äôll be reveng‚Äôd on the whole pack of you\\" for his public humiliation, and Olivia acknowledges that he has \\"been most notoriously abused.\\" The role was first played by Richard Burbage at the Globe Theatre. John Marston notes that the actors of his time often played the role with \\"contemptuous superiority\\"; by contrast his favourite Malvolio, William Ferrin, performed it with \\"lofty condescension\\". Other actors famed for their performance of Malvolio include Sir Alec Guinness, Henry Irving, E. H. Sothern, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Henry Ainley, Sir John Gielgud, Simon Russell Beale, Maurice Evans, Ken Dodd, Richard Briers, Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Sir Derek Jacobi. Richard Wilson took on the role for the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2009 production. In 2012, Stephen Fry assumed the role at Shakespeare's Globe. In 2017, actress Tamsin Greig portrayed a female version of the character (renamed Malvolia) in Simon Godwin's revival of the play at the Royal National Theatre.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/23/twelfth-night-review- olivier-national-theatre-tamsin-greig Inspiration Some Shakespearean scholars hypothesize that the character Malvolio was inspired by Puritan landowner Sir Thomas Posthumous Hoby, who was involved in a well known court case against many of his Yorkshire neighbours in the 1600s. Hoby sued his neighbours when they came uninvited to his house, drank, played cards, mocked his religion, and threatened to rape his wife. Hoby won damages in the case, which may have influenced the scene in Twelfth Night when Malvolio interrupts Sir Toby's late-night reveling.\\"Shakespeare A to Z\\" by Charles Boyce, Roundtable Press, 1990 Famous lines * \\"[S]ome are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.\\" (Act II, Scene v; although Malvolio says this, he does so while reading from the letter that Maria wrote). * \\"My masters, are you mad?\\" The lines would later be repeated, with a slight alteration, by Feste in the final scene of the play as he mocks Malvolio, who afterward storms off.

He is accredited as the author of the first Purana, the Vishnu Purana, before his son Vyasa wrote it in its present form. He was the grandson of Vasishtha, the son of ≈öakti Mahar·π£i, and the father of Vyasa. There are several texts which give reference to Parashara as an author/speaker. Modern scholars believe that there were many individuals who used this name throughout time whereas others assert that the same Parashara taught these various texts and the time of writing them varied. The actual sage himself never wrote the texts; the various texts attributed to him are given in reference to Parashara being the speaker to his student. He is the third member of the ·πö·π£i ParamparƒÅ of the Advaita Guru ParamparƒÅ. Genealogy According to the Vedas, Brahma created Vasishtha, who, with his wife Arundhati, had a son named ≈öakti Mahari·π£hi who sired Parashara. With Satyavati, Parashara is father of Vyasa. VyƒÅsa sired Dhritarashtra and Pandu through his deceased step brother's wives, Ambika and Ambalika and Vidura through a hand-maiden of Ambika and Ambalika. VyƒÅsa also sired Shuka through his wife, JƒÅbƒÅli's daughter PinjalƒÅ. Thus Parashara was the biological great- grandfather of both the warring parties of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Parashara is used as a gotra for the ancestors and their offsprings thereon. Life There is a story of Rishi Parashara: Sakti Rishi died in his early age. This made Vasishtha, his father live in his hermitage with Adrsyanti (wife of Sakti). Vasistha heard the chanting of the Vedas and Adrsyanti told him that Vedic hymn sounds were coming from the child of his son, Sakti, that was developing in her womb. Vasistha was happy to hear this. Adrsyanti gave birth to a son and the child grew up to become Parashara, father of Vyasa. Parashara was raised by his grandfather Vasishtha because he lost his father at an early age. His father, ≈öakti Muni, was on a journey and came across an angry rƒÅk·π£asa (demon) who had once been a king but was turned into a demon feeding on human flesh as a curse from Vi≈õvamitra. The demon devoured Parashara‚Äôs father. In the Vi·π£·πáu PurƒÅ·πáa, Parashara speaks about his anger from this:Wilson, H. H. The Vishnu Purana: A System of Hindu Mythology and Tradition. > I had heard that my father had been devoured by a RƒÅk·π£asa employed by > Vi≈õvamitra: violent anger seized me, and I commenced a sacrifice for the > destruction of the RƒÅk·π£asas: hundreds of them were reduced to ashes by the > rite, when, as they were about to be entirely exterminated, my grandfather > Vasishtha said to me: Enough, my child; let thy wrath be appeased: the > RƒÅk·π£asas are not culpable: thy father's death was the work of destiny. Anger > is the passion of fools; it becometh not a wise man. By whom, it may be > asked, is anyone killed? Every man reaps the consequences of his own acts. > Anger, my son, is the destruction of all that man obtains by arduous > exertions, of fame, and of devout austerities; and prevents the attainment > of heaven or of emancipation. The chief sages always shun wrath: be not > subject to its influence, my child. Let no more of these unoffending spirits > of darkness be consumed. Mercy is the might of the righteous. Parashara Muni (Sage) once halted for a night in a little hamlet on the banks of the river Yamuna. He was put up in the house of the fisherman-chieftain Dusharaj. When dawn broke, the chief asked his daughter, Matsyagandha, whose name means \\"one with the smell of fish\\", to ferry the sage to his next destination. When in the ferry, Parashara was attracted by the beautiful girl and asked her to fulfill his desire of having sexual intercourse with her. Matsyagandha refused fearing the other people and sages who were standing on the bank of river at the another side. He then created an island within the river by his mystic potency and asked her to land the boat there. Seeing people on the river's bank, she demurred and again compelled the rishi to not do such act which can demean his status as a Sadhak (one who performs extreme austerity). But the sage was eager to have sexual relationship with her and by the time he created a dense fog which enveloped the entire river. Matsyagandha agreed however modern writers think her agreement to be the result of fear of curse of the rishi. parashara then had sex with her out of which a son called Krishna DvaipƒÅyana was born , who was dark-complexioned and hence may be called by the name Krishna (black), and also the name Dwaipayana, meaning 'island-born'. He later compiled the classic Vedic literatures of India, and so is called Vyasa who is the 17th incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Parashara granted her the boon that the finest fragrance may emit from her person. She was thereafter known as Satyavati (pure fragrance). Leaving Satyavati in the care of Vyasa, Parashara proceeded to perform Tapas (intense meditation). Later Vyasa also became a Rishi and Satyavati returned to her father's house, and in due course, married ≈öantanu. Parashara was known as the \\"limping sage\\". He had his leg wounded during an attack on his ƒÅ≈õrama. When a ·πõ·π£i dies he merges back into an element or an archetype. When Sage Parashara was walking through a dense forest he and his students were attacked by wolves. He was unable to get away in his old age with a lame leg and he left this world merging into the wolves.Munshi, K. M. The Book of VedaVyaasa: The Master.

A close advisor to the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had an important influence on Imperial politics, mainly in the Italian conflict of Guelphs and Ghibellines. Life Rainald was a scion of the Counts of Dassel, who had inherited large estates in the Suilbergau of Saxony upon the extinction of the ducal Billung dynasty in 1106. A younger son of the affluent count Reinold I of Dassel, he was destined as such to be an ecclesiastic, while his elder brother Ludolf succeeded in the Dassel county. =Ecclesiastical career= Rainald's father sent him to the Hildesheim Cathedral school and at a later date he probably went to Paris in France, where he studied with Adam of Balsham. As early as 1130 he is said to have had a high reputation for classical learning, and to have been a member of the Hildesheim cathedral chapter. He started working as a subdeacon under Bishop Bernard about 1146 and accompanied Abbot Wibald of Stavelot to the Roman Curia. According to documentary evidence he was appointed provost in 1148. Modern statue of Rainald von Dassel, Hildesheim Rainald became one of the most important dignitaries in Hildesheim, where had the first stone bridge built above the Innerste river. He represented the diocese at the 1148 Council of Reims, presided over by Pope Eugene III, openly opposing a canon concerned with clerical dress. Particular attention was paid to his statements by John of Salisbury, who mentioned him in his Historia Pontificalis. In 1153 Rainald received the provostship of the St Maurice monastery in Hildesheim and St Peter's Abbey in Goslar. Soon after, he was also appointed provost of the M√ºnster Cathedral chapter (in 1154), of the Maastricht Basilica of Saint Servatius (1156), and of Xanten Cathedral. However, when a new Bishop of Hildesheim was elected in 1153, he declined the see. =Chancellor= Frederick Barbarossa, elected King of the Romans in 1152, soon noticed Rainald's talents. As a member of the legation sent to Pope Eugene III at Rome he first revealed his political ability. After Frederick had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV in 1155, he appointed Rainald his chancellor. In the rising conflict between emperor and papacy, the Diet of Besan√ßon in October 1157 left no doubt as to the drift of Rainald's policies. He issued a directive which insisted upon the rights and the power of the Emperor, especially in the Kingdom of Italy, the strengthening of the autonomus German Catholic clergy, and the reduction of the influence of the papacy. Full of life, at times rough and blunt and again careful and calculating, Rainald, who, in spite of his ecclesiastical dignities, knew how to wield the sword, henceforth influenced the policy of his Imperial master. The struggle with the Curia escalated at the Diet of Besan√ßon, where Rainald entered into a fierce controversy with the papal legate Roland of Siena (later Pope Alexander III), vigorously rejecting Pope Adrian's use of the word beneficium, which might mean fief as well as benefit. In the expression used, that the pope would have been glad to grant the emperor even greater beneficia (or benefits), it was thought that the old desire of the Curia for the mastery of the world was to be found. Though Rainald did not wish to separate Germany entirely from Rome and still held the medieval respect for the Church, his temperament carried Barbarossa much further than the latter desired, or then was advantageous in the circumstances. When Frederick finally submitted, it was Rainald who prevented him from making concessions which might have proved of advantage. In 1158 he and Duke Otto I of Bavaria undertook a diplomatic journey into Italy to prepare the way for the emperor's campaign. =Archbishop= Shrine of the Three Magi In January 1159 the imperial envoy Rainald entered the city of Milan, which had been peacefully conquered in 1158, however, he was expelled and almost murdered by the inhabitants. While still staying in an Imperial army camp, he was appointed Archbishop of Cologne and Archchancellor of Italy in absence, as successor of the late Frederick II of Berg. When Pope Adrian died in 1159, the double election of Pope Alexander III and Victor IV led to a schism, during which Rainald aimed at strengthening the Imperial antipope Victor. At the 1160 Council of Pavia, he served as the emperor's ambassador and was employed in diplomatic negotiations with Genoa, Pisa, as well as the courts of King Louis VII of France and King Henry II of England, whom he endeavoured to win to the side of the antipope but did not succeed. In 1162 Emperor Barbarossa began a second siege of Milan, which would end with the destruction of the city. In 1163 Alexander III excommunicated Rainald, who had loudly proclaimed in these negotiations the right of the emperor to dispose of the papal see. Basing his action on the Roncalian decrees issued at the Diet of Roncaglia, near Piacenza, in 1158, Rainald was once more successfully employed in Italy in the affairs of the emperor. When Victor IV died, Rainald, of his own volition and without waiting for the consent of the emperor, elected at Lucca a new antipope, Paschal III. Frederick would hardly have continued the schism. Rainald knew this and therefore wished to force the emperor to continue the struggle for imperial supremacy. Back in Germany in 1164, he brought the bones of the Three Magi with him to Cologne as loot from Milan and as a gift of emperor Frederick Barbarossa; today they are still in the Cologne Cathedral. In the meantime the number of the adherents against the lawful pope increased in Germany. Rainald finally won the consent of the English king to common ecclesiastico-political action in behalf of Paschal III and once more took up arms in defence of his one ambition, which he hoped the proposed canonization of Charlemagne at Aachen in 1165 would advance. The new alliance was sealed by the engagement of King Henry's daughter Matilda with the Saxon duke Henry the Lion. In this period Rainald was notably the patron of the Archpoet. In 1167 he was again in Italy, actively engaged in preparing the way for the emperor. Together with Archbishop Christian I of Mainz, and under Rainald's guidance an army won a victory over a much larger force of Roman troops at the Battle of Monte Porzio on 29 May 1167 and laid siege to the city. His death soon after was likely of malaria; his mortal remains were transferred to Cologne and buried in the Lady Chapel of the Cathedral.

Biography The former St John the Evangelist's Church, Chichester Elmes was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and, after studying building under his father, and architecture under George Gibson, became a student at the Royal Academy, where he gained the silver medal in 1804. He designed a large number of buildings in London, and was surveyor and civil engineer to the Port of London, but is best known as a writer on the arts.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1801 and 1842. He was vice- president of the London Architectural Society from its foundation in 1806. In 1813-4 he restored the top part of the spire of Chichester Cathedral, reconstructing the pendulum device incorporated into it by Sir Christopher Wren to counteract the effects of strong winds. Elmes described the contraption in his biography of Wren, calling it \\"one of the most ingenious and appropriate of its great inventor's applications.\\" He was the founder and editor of the Annals of the Fine Arts, a quarterly magazine published between 1816 and 1820. The content of the periodical was greatly influenced by the views of the historical painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, with whom Elmes had become friends while both were still students at the Royal Academy. Elmes claimed to have written the first review of Haydon's work ever published, in the Monthly Magazine in 1806. He also edited the Magazine of the Fine Arts and Monthly Review from 1821. Elmes resigned from his post with the Port of London in 1848, due to a loss of sight, from which he later partially recovered. He died at Greenwich on 2 April 1862, and was buried at Charlton. The architect Harvey Lonsdale Elmes was his son. John Haviland, who became a successful prison architect in the United States was his pupil.

The mountain is within easy reach from the city and attracts a large number of national tourists. Namsan covers an area of about 8 km (north-south) by 12 km (east-west). Some 180 peaks are counted, of which Geumobong (468 m) and Gouibong (495 m) are the best-known. There are about 40 valleys. Cultural remains Namsan is home to many historic and cultural remains, and is now part of the historic area around Gyeongju that was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. Namsan is home to many remains from the Silla period, including some tombs of Silla rulers. There are hundreds of remains scattered around the mountain. Poseokjeong is one of the most famous of these sites, lying at the foot of Namsan. Other remains include Korean Buddhist art, sculptures, about 80 carved reliefs, about 60 stone pagodas and remains of about 100 temples and palaces mostly built between the 7th and 10th century. 12 of these relicts are designated national treasures. The concentration of remains is particularly high at the foothills west of Namsan. The remains are thought to reflect the rise and fall of the Silla kingdom. Najeong Well is the mystic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla dynasty. Only a small stone with inscriptions remains of this site. According to legend, one day in 69 BC Seobeol‚Äîchieftain of Goheo village‚Äîspotted a white horse kneeling by Najeong well. When approaching the site to take a closer look, the horse disappeared, but he found an egg. From the egg hatched a boy who was chosen to become king at the age of 13. The Yangsanjae shrine was built in honour of a founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla kingdom was established. A famous site is the three stone Buddha statue of Bae-ri. The site features three Buddha figures carved into stone. More recently, a roof was erected to protect the statues. The sitting stone statue of Buddha in the Mireuk valley, the sitting image of Bodhisattva carved into a stone wall at Sinseonam are two of the designated national treasures. In addition, there are sites of local significance, such as the sitting figure of Sakyamuni carved on a rock in Samneung Valley. This figure is about 7 metres high and about 5 metres wide. It is the biggest sitting statue at Namsam. Cheongwansa is a historic temple.

The lyrics are by Lou Reed, with music composed by John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and Reed. The song concerns drug use, violence, homosexuality, and transvestism. Reed said of the lyrics: \\"'Sister Ray' was done as a joke‚Äîno, not as a joke, but it has eight characters in it and this guy gets killed and nobody does anything. It was built around this story that I wrote about this scene of total debauchery and decay. I like to think of 'Sister Ray' as a transvestite smack dealer. The situation is a bunch of drag queens taking some sailors home with them, shooting up on smack and having this orgy when the police appear.\\"Reed, unknown interview. Quote appeared, incomplete, in Entire quote in At 17 minutes 29 seconds, it is the longest song on White Light/White Heat, taking up most of the second side of the record, as well as the longest song in the Velvet Underground's studio discography. Rock critic Lester Bangs wrote in 1970, \\"The early Velvets had the good sense to realize that whatever your capabilities, music with a simple base was the best. Thus, \\"Sister Ray\\" evolved from a most basic funk riff seventeen minutes into stark sound structures of incredible complexity.\\" Studio version=Recording= \\"Sister Ray\\" was recorded in one take. The band agreed to accept whatever faults occurred during recording, resulting in over seventeen minutes of improvised material. The song was recorded with Reed providing lead vocals and guitar, Morrison on guitar, and Tucker on drums, while Cale plays an organ routed through a distorted guitar amplifier. Morrison remarked that he was amazed at the volume of Cale's organ during the recording and that he had switched the guitar pickup on his Fender Stratocaster from the bridge position to the neck position to get \\"more oomph\\". It is also notable that the song features no bass guitar because Cale, who usually played bass or viola, played organ on the take. The band had a sponsorship from Vox amplifiers, which allowed use of top-of-the-line amps and distortion pedals to create a very distorted and noisy sound. After the opening sequence, which is a modally flavored I-bVII-IV G-F-C chord progression, much of the song is led by Cale and Reed exchanging percussive chords and noise for over ten minutes, similar to avant-jazz. Reed recalled that recording engineer Gary Kellgren walked out while recording the song: \\"The engineer said, 'I don't have to listen to this. I'll put it in Record, and then I'm leaving. When you're done, come get me.'\\"American Masters: Lou Reed: Rock & Roll Heart documentary Reed called the song \\"Sister Ray\\" in a nod to Ray Davies of the British band the Kinks.Tom Robinson Radio Show, BBC 6 Music 22/5/07 =Personnel= * Lou Reed ‚Äì lead vocals, electric guitar * John Cale ‚Äì Vox Continental organ * Sterling Morrison ‚Äì Fender Stratocaster electric guitar * Maureen Tucker ‚Äì drums Live versions \\"Sister Ray\\" was a concert favorite of the band, who regularly closed their set with the song.

The triple live album Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes, released in 2001, features three live performances of \\"Sister Ray\\" from 1969, with approximate running times of 24, 38 and 29 minutes. The band also had an intro entitled \\"Sweet Sister Ray\\" that they would perform occasionally. On the single known recording of this intro (recorded during the April 30, 1968 show, and without the complete subsequent performance of \\"Sister Ray\\"), \\"Sweet Sister Ray\\" alone lasts for over thirty- eight minutes.

The site once featured a royal pavilion ‚Äî said to have been the most beautiful royal villa of the time ‚Äî but the only remains today is a granite water feature. This abalone-shaped watercourse highlights the importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The \\"Poseokjeong\\" consists of several hand-carved stone pieces. These pieces create very geometric shape and it sloped slightly for the smooth water flow. At that time, people gathered around the Poseokjeong. They floated their cups (for alcohol) and when the cup stops at a person, he should drink and recite a poem. During banquets in the last days of the Unified Silla kingdom, the king's official and noble guests would sit along the watercourse, chatting and reciting poetry, engaged in drinking games. One of the guests would start by enunciating a line of poetry, challenge one of the other guests to compose an appropriate second line while floating of cup wine in the water. Due to the variety of curves in the channel, the speed the wine cups transversed the course was influenced by the shape of the cup, rate of the water flow and the level of the wine in the cup. Should the cup of wine reach the guest before he could submit a suitable subsequent line he must consume that entire cup of wine and try again, and again, until the task was accomplished.Paxton, Norbert \\"Korea\\" (2008) pg. 212 The site has an area of 7,432 m¬≤/4.6 mi¬≤. There are no records of when Poseokjeong was built, but the stone channel is known to have been created in the time of Unified Silla. It was designated as historic site No.1 in 1963. Poseokjeong is named after the abalone-shaped water feature. The feature itself is about 10.3 m/11.2 yd in length and 5 m/5.4 yd in width, and consists of 63 blocks of granite. These blocks are on average 26 cm/10.2 in deep and 35 cm/13.8 in wide.http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264255 Zelkova, pine and bamboo trees preserve a calm atmosphere at Poseokjeong today, but the garden was tended differently at the time. Some of the trees are several hundred years old. When still in use, the watercourse is thought to have used water from the nearby stream in the Namsan valley. The water of the Namsan valley was appreciated by the Silla people for its purity and cleanliness. A stone turtle once spewed the water, but this feature does not remain today. A legend is linked with Poseokjeong. According to this legend, the spirit of Namsan attended a party of king Heong-gang Wang. The king danced after the god, which according to the legend started a Silla dance known as eomu sansinmu (King Dances, God Dances).

It was first published anonymously in The Royal Devonport Telegraph and Plymouth Chronicle in September 1826. Over 100 years after the events. Hawker, a churchman, assumed that the Trelawny mentioned in the song was Sir Jonathan Trelawny, the Bishop of Bristol, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London by King James II in 1688. However it is more likely that it referred to his grandfather, Sir John Trelawny, a Cornish Royalist leader who had been imprisoned by parliament in 1628. The people of Cornwall did not actually march to rescue Trelawny, as told in the song. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three weeks, then tried and acquitted.Piers Brendon, Hawker Of Morwenstow: Portrait of an Eccentric Victorian, Random House, 2011 According to Cornish historian Robert Morton Nance, \\"The Song of the Western Men\\" was possibly inspired by the song \\"Come, all ye jolly tinner boys\\" which was written more than ten years earlier in about 1807, when Napoleon Bonaparte made threats that would affect trade in Cornwall at the time of the invasion of Poland. \\"Ye jolly tinner boys\\" contains the line \\"Why forty thousand Cornish boys shall know the reason why.\\" In 1881, at the laying of the foundation stone of the Cathedral at Truro, the song was described by Canon Harvey as \\"... the national anthem of our dear Cornwall.\\" The song is a regular favourite sung at Cornish rugby union matches and other Cornish gatherings. In some schools in Cornwall, the children are taught the first verse and chorus, and sing it at events such as Murdoch Day and St Piran's Day (5 March). Since 2016 the latter occasion has also seen the 'Trelawny Shout' - the song being sung in pubs across Cornwall for charity. \\"Trelawny\\" A good sword and a trusty hand! A merry heart and true! King James's men shall understand What Cornish lads can do! And have they fixed the where and when? And shall Trelawny die? Here's twenty thousand Cornish men Will know the reason why! :And shall Trelawny live? :Or shall Trelawny die? :Here's twenty thousand Cornish men :Will know the reason why! Out spake their Captain brave and bold: A merry wight was he: Though London Tower were Michael's hold, We'll set Trelawny free! We'll cross the Tamar, land to land: The Severn is no stay: With \\"one and all,\\" and hand in hand; And who shall bid us nay? :And shall Trelawny live? :Or shall Trelawny die? :Here's twenty thousand Cornish men :Will know the reason why! And when we come to London Wall, A pleasant sight to view, Come forth! come forth! ye cowards all: Here's men as good as you. Trelawny he's in keep and hold; Trelawny he may die: Here's twenty thousand Cornish bold Will know the reason why :And shall Trelawny live? :Or shall Trelawny die? :Here's twenty thousand Cornish men :Will know the reason why! Translation into Cornish There are two versions of the song in Cornish. The first was written by Henry Jenner in 1905: { width=\\"100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  'Ma lel an leuv, 'ma'n kledha mas 'Ma'n golon lowen, gwir! Tus Mytern Jams 'wra konvedhes Pandr'yll Kernowyon sur!

Other sources say the line refers to a hold on St Michaels Mount (i.e. a prison or cell). * There is some doubt as to whether the work was entirely original or an adaptation of an earlier tune. * \\"Trelawny\\" is often referred to, by anyone who is Cornish, as the \\"unofficial\\" Cornish anthem and the most popular which is heard at Cornish rugby union matches and other Cornish gatherings, but the Cornish anthem that has been used by Gorsedh Kernow for the last 75 plus years is \\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\\" (\\"The Land of My Fathers\\", or, literally, \\"Old Country of our Fathers\\") with a similar tune to the Welsh national anthem (\\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\\") and the Breton national anthem. \\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\\" is not heard so often, as it is sung in Cornish). Those who prefer an anthem in English often use \\"Hail to the Homeland\\".

Manning lived on Cougar Mountain, within the city limits of Bellevue, Washington, calling his home the \\"200 meter hut\\". His book Walking the Beach to Bellingham is an autobiography and manifesto fleshing out his journal of a hike along the shore of Puget Sound over a two-year span. From 1954 to 1956, Harvey Manning managed Seattle radio station KISW.Harvey Manning, \\"Letter to the Editor,\\" Seattle Weekly, 21 September 1994. Harvey Manning died November 12, 2006, in Bellevue.  Books  Manning is most famous for being the editorial committee chair for the first edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, a textbook for climbing and scrambling. The first edition was so successful that it created Mountaineers Books, the publishing outlet of The Mountaineers. Manning is also noted for writing the \\"100 Hikes\\" series of hiking guidebooks, along with Ira Spring: * 50 Hikes in Mount Rainier National Park (1969) * 101 Hikes in the North Cascades (1970) * 102 Hikes in the Alpine Lakes, South Cascades, and Olympics (1971) * 100 Hikes in the South Cascades and Olympics (1985) ISBN * 100 Hikes in the Glacier Peak Region (1988) * 55 Hikes in Central Washington (1990) * 100 Classic Hikes in Washington (1998) (Winner National Outdoor Book Award, Design and Artistic Merit, 1998) * 55 Hikes around Snoqualmie Pass (2001) These guidebooks are the standard books for hiking throughout western Washington. Manning also wrote many other books on outdoor activities, including: * Backpacking: One Step at a Time (1972) * Footsore, Vols 1-4 (1977) (a series of guidebooks to hiking near Issaquah, Washington). * Walking the Beach to Bellingham (1986)  Advocacy  Manning advocated trail protection and maintenance for much of his life, based on his extensive experience in the Washington outdoors (having backpacked since the 1930s). He was the bane of mountain bikers in the Seattle area. Manning believed foot traffic (both the boots and the horseshoe variety) cannot coexist with the greater speeds of bicycle enthusiasts and disdained local politicians beholden to wheeled-recreation advocates for \\"spouting pure Lycra\\". Largely as a result of his efforts, Cougar Mountain is off-limits to bikes and even Tiger Mountain has very limited single-track mileage where bikes are permitted. Manning was a member of the North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) since its founding in 1957, serving as an editor of the NCCC journal \\"The Wild Cascades.\\" Back issues are available on the NCCC website, see link below. A DVD of images of the North Cascades with his writing as the script is released by Crest Pictures as \\"The Irate Birdwatcher,\\" which was a moniker he used in his early writings. His final book, published by NCCC, is \\"Wilderness Alps: Conservation and Conflict in the North Cascades,\\" and details the history of the preservation movement there. It is available at the NCCC website. Many of the names for peaks, creeks, wetlands, and trails on Cougar Mountain were invented by Harvey Manning. He discovered Coal Creek Falls and beat a trail to it, and discovered the foundation for the steam hoist in Red Town. With the goal of preserving wildlands within urban King County, Manning designated (in the pages of Footsore 1) the odd twenty mile-long spur of Cascade Mountain foothills along I-90 near Seattle as the \\"Issaquah Alps\\" and founded the Issaquah Alps Trails Club in 1979. The club serves to improve and publicize hiking around Issaquah, Washington. A bronze statue of Manning stands in an Issaquah park. Today many of his conservation goals are carried on by the American Alps Legacy Project, an initiative of NCCC and the Mountaineers.

He was also a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Melfi, in the Kingdom of Naples. Montecuccoli was considered as the only commander to be the equal of the French general Turenne, (1611‚Äì1675), and like him, was closely associated with the post-1648 development of linear infantry tactics. Early life Montecuccoli was born on 21 February 1609 in the Castello di Montecuccolo in Pavullo nel Frignano, near Modena. Early military service At the age of sixteen Montecuccoli began as a private soldier under his uncle, Count Ernest Montecuccoli (died 1633), a distinguished Austrian general. Four years later, after much active service in Germany and the Low Countries, he became a captain of infantry. He was severely wounded at the storming of New Brandenburg, and again in the same year (1631) at the first battle of Breitenfeld, where he fell into the hands of the Swedes. He was again wounded at L√ºtzen in 1632, and on his recovery was made a major in his uncle's regiment. Shortly afterwards he became a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry. He did good service at the first battle of Nordlingen (1634), and at the storming of Kaiserslautern in the following year won his colonelcy by a feat of arms of unusual brilliance, a charge through the breach at the head of his heavy cavalry. He fought in Pomerania, Bohemia and Saxony (surprise of Wolmirstadt, battles of Wittstock and Chemnitz), and in 1639 he was taken prisoner at Melnik and detained for two and a half years in Stettin and Weimar. In captivity he studied military science, and also geometry by the way of Euclid, history of Tacitus, and Vitruvius' architecture, all the while planning his great work on war. Commanding officer Returning to Italy and to the field in 1642, Montecuccoli commanded mercenaries loyal to the Duke of his native Modena during the First War of Castro, but when that conflict ground to an unproductive stalemate he departed. His involvement, though understandable given his allegiance to Modena, was nonetheless unusual in that his service pitted him against the papal forces of Pope Urban VIII. The Castello Montecuccoli in Modena In 1643 he was promoted to lieutenant-field-marshal and obtained a seat in the Council of War. In 1645‚Äì46 he served in Hungary against Prince R√°k√≥czy of Transylvania, on the Danube and Neckar against the French, and in Silesia and Bohemia against the Swedes. The victory of Triebel in Silesia won him the rank of General of Cavalry, and at the battle of Zusmarshausen in 1648 his stubborn rearguard fighting rescued the imperials from annihilation. For some years after the Peace of Westphalia Montecuccoli was chiefly concerned with the business of the council of war, though he went to Flanders and England as the representative of the emperor, and to Sweden as the envoy of the pope to Queen Christina, and at Modena his lance was victorious in a great tourney. In 1657, soon after his marriage with Countess Margarethe de Dietrichstein, he was ordered by the Emperor to take part in the Habsburg expedition (as agreed between the King of Poland and the Emperor) against Prince R√°k√≥czy, Charles X Gustav of Sweden and the Cossacks, who had already, in 1655, attacked the Kingdom of Poland in the war known in Poland as The Deluge or elsewhere as the Second Northern War. During the conflict he was promoted to commanding officer of the division. He became field-marshal in the imperial army and his division, along with Stefan Czarniecki's division, Frederick William's army and Danish forces, participated in the struggle in Denmark against the invading Swedes. Eventually the war ended with the Peace of Oliva in 1660 and Montecuccoli returned to his sovereign. From 1661 to 1664 Montecuccoli, with inferior numbers, defended Austria against the Turks but at St. Gotthard Abbey, on the R√°ba, he and Carl I. Ferdinand Count of Montenari defeated the Turks so comprehensively that they entered into a twenty-year truce. They were given the Order of the Golden Fleece, and Montecuccoli became president of the council of war and director of artillery. He also devoted much time to compiling his various works on military history and science. He opposed the progress of the French arms under Louis XIV, and when the inevitable war broke out he received command of the imperial forces. In the campaign of 1673 he completely outmanoeuvred his rival Turenne on the Neckar and the Rhine, captured Bonn and joined his army with that of William III, the prince of Orange on the lower Rhine. He retired from the army when, in 1674, the Great Elector was named command in chief, but the brilliant successes of Turenne in the winter of 1674 and 1675 brought him back. For months the two famous commanders manoeuvred against each other in the Rhine valley, but on the eve of a decisive battle Turenne was killed and Montecuccoli promptly invaded Alsace, where he engaged in another war of manoeuvre with the Great Cond√©. The siege of Philippsburg was Montecuccoli's last achievement in war. Retirement and death The rest of Montecuccoli's life was spent in military administration and literary and scientific work at Vienna. In 1679 the emperor made him a prince of the empire, and shortly afterwards he received the dukedom of Melfi from the King of Spain. Montecuccoli died in an accident at Linz in October 1680. Assessment Count Raimondo Montecuccoli As a general, Montecuccoli shared with Turenne and Cond√© the first place among European soldiers of his time. For his success in halting the Turkish advance he had been hailed the savior of Europe. He was also influential as a military theorist, with perhaps his most famous quote being \\"For war you need three things: 1. Money. 2. Money. 3. Money.\\" See Chapter 6 of Book 3, A Warriors Life (2013), Roger Gard's translation of Servitude et grandeur militaires by Alfred de Vigny along with Gard's notes. His Memorie della guerra profoundly influenced the age which followed his own. \\"Unequalled as a master of 17th- century warfare, Montecuccoli excelled in the art of fortification and siege, march and countermarch, and cutting his enemy‚Äôs lines of communications. In advocating standing armies, he clearly foresaw future trends in the military field\\". Family In 1657, Montecuccoli married Countess Margarethe de Dietrichstein. With the death of his only son Leopold Philip Montecuccoli in 1698 the principality became extinct, but the title of count descended through his daughters to two branches, Austrian and Modenese. Bibliography The Memorie della guerra was published at Venice in 1703 and at Cologne in 1704. A French edition was issued in Paris in 1712 and a Latin edition appeared in 1718 at Vienna, and the German Kriegsnachrichten des F√ºrsten Raymundi Montecuccoli was issued at Leipzig in 1736. Of this work there are manuscripts in various libraries, and many memoirs on military history, tactics, fortification, written in Italian, Latin and German, remain still unedited in the archives of Vienna. The collected Opere di Raimondo Montecuccoli were published at Milan (1807), Turin (1821) and Venice (1840), and include political essays and poetry. Memorials In 1934 the Italian navy launched the Raimondo Montecuccoli, a Condottieri class light cruiser named in his honour which served with the Regia Marina during World War II.

The two bridges comprise a heritage-listed steel Pratt truss bridge with inoperable lift span that carries three lanes of northbound vehicular traffic plus a grade-separated pedestrian footpath, completed in 1935; and a reinforced concrete fixed-span bridge that carries three lanes of southbound vehicular traffic, completed in 1988. History The original Ryde Bridge was opened on 7 December 1935 by the Premier Bertram Stevens, accompanied by the Mayor of Ryde. The original bridge is a lift bridge, which was required to allow shipping to pass to the State Timber Yard then located on the southern bank of the Parramatta River, just west of the bridge. However the lifting mechanism was removed in the late 20th century and it has not been opened since. The bridge was paid for by the Ryde Council with the assistance of a grant from the New South Wales Government. The bridge carried a toll for 13 years until the bridge was paid for. In 1948, ownership of the bridge was transferred to the NSW Department of Main Roads. A new bridge was built on the eastern or downstream side using steel trough girders, closed on top by a composite concrete running deck, and completed in 1987. The second bridge carries southbound traffic, with the original bridge carrying northbound traffic only. It was officially opened on 25 November 1988 by the Premier Nick Greiner and Federal Minister For Transport Ralph Willis. Before the original bridge was constructed, the Parramatta River was crossed in this area by a vehicular punt, just downstream of the railway bridge. The southern ramp still exists near the southern end of the railway bridge, however the northern ramp has been covered over by Meadowbank ferry wharf.  Heritage significance Other The Hexham Bridge, located northeast of Sydney and which spans the Hunter River is very similar to 1935 Pratt truss Ryde Bridge.

Krzyzewskiville, or K-ville for short, is a phenomenon that occurs before major men's basketball games at Duke University. In simplest terms, it is the line for undergraduate students wishing to gain access to the designated tenting games. It is often mistakenly referred to as a ticket line. However, there are no student tickets; students are admitted from the line an hour and a half before each game. Krzyzewskiville is named for Mike Krzyzewski, often called \\"Coach K\\", the much loved coach who has helped make Duke's basketball program one of the best in the nation. He has been known to buy pizza for the K-ville residents from time to time and has held open-forum \\"team meetings\\" with the Cameron Crazies before games against their arch-rival, the North Carolina Tar Heels. Graduate and professional students do not participate in Krzyzewskiville, as Duke's Graduate and Professional Student Council operates a separate weekend-long campout each September followed by a lottery for a small number of graduate and professional student season tickets. The first K-ville While lining up hours before games (the UNC game in particular) had always been a regular practice, every now and then a group of students would be ambitious enough to get their sleeping bags out and sleep in line the night before in order to ensure their front row seats. In 1986 Kimberly Reed, a resident of the Mirecourt selective living group, took the practice one step further and decided with a group of her Mirecourt friends to line up even earlier for the UNC game and sleep in tents. Showing up on Thursday for the Saturday tip-off, the fifteen friends set up four tents and prepared to sleep outside of Cameron Indoor. They were quickly noticed by the rest of the student body, and by game time there were 75 tents in line to see Duke battle their long-standing rival UNC. The NBC news crew put them on the evening news, and they made the front page of USA Today. Their dedication was rewarded with an 85-72 Duke victory, and tenting in K-ville quickly became a Duke University tradition. K-ville rules UNC vs Duke basketball game. By 2000, K-ville had been landscaped with a uniform lawn on which the tents could be pitched, and was being equipped with wireless internet service. The number of tenting games in a single season is determined by the Line Monitor Committee of the Duke Student Government. Tents are sometimes allowed for big games like the ACC-Big 10 challenge, but the rules for UNC game tenting only apply to that game. Three to eight weeks before the actual game, students begin to put up and live in tents outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. As many as twelve people can occupy a specific tent group. As regulated by Duke Student Government, there must be a certain number of students in the tent at regular, periodic checks. The tenting season is divided into three sections. From the beginning of tenting in early January for the first third of the season, tents of 12 must have 2 people in the tent during the day and 10 people each night. For the next third of the season, tents must have 1 person in the tent during the day and 6 people each night. For the final third, before the game, tents still must have 1 person during the day but only 2 people each night. The two weekend nights prior to the game, or the weekend before the game, are personal check nights, during which each of the twelve tent members must be at the tent for 3 of 5 personal checks spread over the two nights. If a tent misses a tent check twice, it gets moved to the end of the line (assuming availability). If K-ville is at full capacity (100 tents) and a waitlist exists at the time of the second miss, the tent gets removed completely. Tents must register with the line monitors (students in charge of overseeing and enforcing K-ville rules and regulations) prior to setting up. There are three types: Black registration, which is the longest and most intense option in which the use of actual tents was forbidden in the past. All 12 tenters used to sleep in K-ville during black tenting. Today, however, pre-fabricated tents are required throughout the tenting season and only 10 people must sleep in the tent. Black tenting groups participate in attendance events and trivia that determine their order in line. A tent that starts after the beginning of black tenting but during the period when 10 members are required to be in the tent at night is referred to as a \\"dirty black tent.\\" Blue registration is the next period, in which a tent can register at any time before approximately two weeks prior to the game; after this, white registration goes into effect, which is significantly more complicated. A tent that does not start on the first day of blue tenting is typically referred to as a \\"dirty blue tent.\\" For blue registration, a tent group need only give their names to the line monitors and start tenting. However, for white registration, students must participate in the Race to the Secret Spots, where they meet the line monitors at locations on campus that are disclosed on a website and social media at a specified time; this results in a hectic dash to the locations once they are made public. The locations are given in riddle form, making it more difficult to identify the spot, even once the clues are made public. Most tenting groups station members around campus, and identify which members are closest to the spots once they are disclosed online. Hundreds of tent representatives usually appear at the White registration locations for the 30 remaining spots not taken by Black and Blue tenters, with the spots filling up in a matter of minutes. The 31st to 60th groups to complete the Race to the Secret Spots will receive flex tenting spots, where they are required to follow the rules of white tenting but are not guaranteed tickets. Flex tenting was preceded by the walk-up line, which formed 48 hours before tipoff. It consisted of couples, and one member of each couple was required to be in line at all times. People in the walk-up line were not guaranteed to get into the game; people who had waited more than 24 hours sometimes did not get in. The rigor and uncertainty of the walk-up line agitated students, which caused a riot before the 2018 UNC game . Flex tenting began in 2019. K-ville is also a social function at Duke, as many students participate at least once. Duke has installed Wi-Fi service and Ethernet ports in the lightposts so that students can participate in tenting without falling behind in their schoolwork, although the internet is known to be very unreliable. Students also complain that the cold weather also prevents them from getting any real work done. Heaters are not permitted in K-ville; students must keep warm by simply using sleeping bags and dressing appropriately. Robertson scholars In December 2006, the Duke Student Government banned Robertson Scholars from UNC (who attend Duke for one semester) from participating in tenting for the game versus UNC, although they can still get in via the walk-up line.Krzyzewskiville closed to joint scholars from North Carolina. \\"USA Today.\\" Accessed on 12 Dec 2006. Some feel this is a violation of the Robertson Scholars Program, which states that \\"they have full student privileges at both Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill. This includes access to courses; faculty and research opportunities; and arts, cultural, and sporting events.\\"Robertson Scholars - Opportunities. \\"robertsonscholars.org.\\" Accessed on 15 Dec 2006. That tenting season, some Robertsons tented with some full- time Duke students, using their Duke ID cards to get into the game. However, once inside the student section the Robertson attendees removed Duke attire worn into the game to reveal UNC paraphernalia. To prevent this situation from happening again, Robertson Scholars visiting from UNC were banned from tenting in K-ville, starting in 2006. Popularity of K-ville In January 2017, over 150 tent groups registered for black and blue tenting, exceeding the 70 tent cap. This was the first time in the history of K-ville that the 70 tent cap reserved for black and blue tenters was exceeded. The line monitors created a preliminary trivia test based on the current men's basketball season as a way to select the lucky 70 tents that would be allowed to tent. The tenting starting date was pushed back from Wednesday, January 11 to Thursday January 12 to accommodate the testing period. If a tent group did not make the top 70 they would be placed on a wait list in the order of their scores. If a tent among the first 70 dropped or got bumped, the next group on the waitlist would move up and become a blue tent. Tenting has become such an integral part of the undergraduate experience at Duke that many of the most notable tents in K-ville are passed down within student groups from year to year. Many of tents are named and elaborately decorated, and some of which were documented in a 2015/2016 video series published by the University called \\"K-Ville Kribs.\\" . The oldest tent in K-ville, nicknamed \\"Das Boot\\", has been one of the most prominent tents in Krzyzewskiville since 2013. . Player presence in K-ville Over the past few years, current players on the Duke Men's Basketball team have begun to show a greater involvement with and appreciation of the tenters in K-Ville. For the 2013-14 season, Jabari Parker made homemade dessert bars, dubbed \\"Jabari Bars,\\" and passed them out to tenters, and Andre Dawkins gave out fruit snacks to tenters on a different occasion. During the 2014-15 season, Marshall Plumlee gave tours of the most notable tents in K-Ville and interviewed tents' members in a mini video series called \\"K-Ville Kribs.\\" In his last year on the Duke Men's Basketball team (2016‚Äì17) Amile Jefferson oversaw a half-court tournament played by current tenters, where the winning tent group got to be the first group for the final game of the season (Duke vs. Florida State University).

Malins and Morchard Bishop, James Smetham and Francis Danby: Two 19th Century Romantic Painters, London, Stevens, 1974. His imaginative, dramatic landscapes were comparable to those of John Martin. Danby initially developed his imaginative style while he was the central figure in a group of artists who have come to be known as the Bristol School. His period of greatest success was in London in the 1820s. Early life Born in the south-east of Ireland, he was one of a set of twins; his father, James Danby, farmed a small property he owned near Wexford, but his death, in 1807, caused the family to move to Dublin, while Francis was still a schoolboy. He began to practice drawing at the Royal Dublin Society's schools; and under an erratic young artist named James Arthur O'Connor he began painting landscapes. Danby also made acquaintance with George Petrie. Panorama of the Coast at Sunset, c. 1813, National Gallery of Art In 1813 Danby left for London together with O'Connor and Petrie. This expedition, undertaken with very inadequate funds, quickly came to an end, and they had to get home again by walking. At Bristol they made a pause, and Danby, finding he could get trifling sums for watercolours, remained there working diligently and sending to the London exhibitions pictures of importance. There his large oil paintings quickly attracted attention. Bristol School alt=Four people sit together on a shaded lawn beside a riverside path. A small boat sails on the river, which bends away into a gap between sunlit wooded hills. From around 1818/19, Danby was a member of the informal group of artists which has become known as the Bristol School, taking part in their evening sketching meetings and sketching excursions visiting local scenery. His View of the Avon Gorge (1822) depicts figures sketching in a location favoured by the group. He remained connected with members of the Bristol School for around a decade, even after leaving Bristol in 1824. The group had initially formed around Edward Bird, and Danby would eventually succeed Bird as its central figure. Bird's genre painting had a naturalistic style and fresh colours, and his influence has been seen on Danby's style. Examples are Danby's treatment of figures in Boys Sailing a Little Boat (c. 1821) and The Delivery of Israel out of Egypt (1825). Danby was also close to Edward Villiers Rippingille, whose style developed alongside that of Danby under the influence of Bird. The Bristol artists, particularly the amateur Francis Gold, were also important in influencing Danby towards a more imaginative and poetical style. George Cumberland, another of the amateurs, had influential London connections. In 1820 when Francis Danby exhibited The Upas Tree of Java at the British Institution, Cumberland used his influence to promote its favourable reception. There is also evidence from their correspondence that Cumberland suggested subjects for Danby to paint. Cumberland was a close friend of William Blake, and it has been suggested that Blake's work may also have had some influence on Danby, for example in Danby's second exhibited painting, Disappointed Love, shown at the Royal Academy in 1821. Danby's atmospheric work An Enchanted Island, successfully exhibited in 1825 at the British Institution and then back in Bristol at the Bristol Institution, was in turn particularly influential on other Bristol School artists. Letitia Elizabeth Landon included a poem on this work in Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures in her collection, The Troubadour (1826). Success The Shipwreck, oil on canvas, 1859 The Upas Tree (1820) and The Delivery of Israel (1825) brought him his election as an Associate Member of the Royal Academy. He left Bristol for London, and in 1828 exhibited his Opening of the Sixth Seal at the British Institution, receiving from that body a prize of 200 guineas; and this picture was followed by two others on the theme of the Apocalypse. Danby painted \\"vast illusionist canvases\\" comparable to those of John Martin ‚Äì of \\"grand, gloomy and fantastic subjects which chimed exactly with the Byronic taste of the 1820s.\\"Lionel Lambourne, Victorian Painting, London, Phaidon Press, 1999; pp. 156, 161. Later years alt=A rocky outcrop is surrounded by a swirling torrent of water under dark storm-clouds. A cluster of people swept into the water cling to shattered tree-trunks. An angel hovers over them. Danby was sculpted by Christopher Moore in 1828.Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851:C Moore by Rupert Gunnis In 1829 Danby's wife deserted him, running off with the painter Paul Falconer Poole.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, Boston, Little, Brown & Co., 1999; p. 20. Danby left London, declaring that he would never live there again, and that the Academy, instead of aiding him, had, somehow or other, used him badly. For a decade he lived on the Lake of Geneva in Switzerland, becoming a Bohemian with boat-building fancies, painting only now and then. He later moved to Paris for a short period of time. He returned to England in 1840, when his sons, James and Thomas, both artists, were growing up. Danby exhibited his large (15 feet wide) and powerful The Deluge that year; the success of that painting, \\"the largest and most dramatic of all his Martinesque visions,\\"Wood, p. 21. revitalised his reputation and career. Other pictures by him were The Golden Age (c. 1827, exhibited 1831), Rich and Rare Were the Gems She Wore (1837), and The Evening Gun (1848). Some of Danby's later paintings, like The Woodnymph's Hymn to the Rising Sun (1845), tended toward a calmer, more restrained, more cheerful manner than those in his earlier style; but he returned to his early mode for The Shipwreck (1859). He lived his final years at Exmouth in Devon, where he died in 1861. Along with John Martin and J. M. W. Turner, Danby is considered among the leading British artists of the Romantic period.Lambourne, pp. 161‚Äì3; Wood, pp. 76‚Äì7. Both of Danby's sons were landscape painters. The elder, James Francis Danby (1816‚Äì75), exhibited at the Royal Academy. \\"He excelled in depicting sunrise and sunset.\\"Michael Bryan, Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Vol. 1, revised edition edited by Robert Edmund Graves, London, George Bell, 1886; p. 348.

The Roland is a Franco-German mobile short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. The Roland was also purchased by the U.S. Army as one of very few foreign SAM systems. Development Roland was designed to a joint French and German requirement for a low-level mobile missile system to protect mobile field formations and fixed, high-value targets such as airfields. Development began in 1963 as a study by Nord Aviation of France and B√∂lkow of Germany with the system then called SABA in France and P-250 in Germany.Gunston The two companies formed a joint development project in 1964 and later (as A√©rospatiale of France and MBB of Germany) founded the Euromissile company for this and other missile programs. Aerospatiale took primary responsibility for the Roland 1 day/clear-weather system while MBB took primary responsibility for the Roland 2 all-weather system. Aerospatiale was also responsible for the rear and propulsion system of the missile while MBB developed the front end of the missile with warhead and guidance systems. The first guided launch of a Roland prototype took place in June 1968, destroying a CT-20 target drone and fielding of production systems was expected from January 1970. The test and evaluation phase took much longer than originally anticipated with the clear-weather Roland I finally entering operational service with the French Army in April 1977, while the all-weather Roland II was first fielded by the German Army in 1978 followed by the French Army in 1981. The long delays and ever-increasing costs combined with inflation meant Roland was never procured in the numbers originally anticipated. Variants The Roland SAM system was designed to engage enemy air targets flying at speeds of up to Mach 1.3 at altitudes between 20 meters and 5,500 meters with a minimum effective range of 500 meters and a maximum of 6,300 meters. The system can operate in optical or radar mode and can switch between these modes during an engagement. A pulse- doppler search radar with a range of 15‚Äì18 km detects the target which can then be tracked either by the tracking radar or an optical tracker. The optical channel would normally be employed only in daylight against very low- level targets or in a heavy jamming environment.Jane's Armour and Artillery The Roland missile is a two-stage solid propellant unit 2.4 meters long with a weight of 66.5 kg including the 6.5 kg multiple hollow-charge fragmentation warhead which contains 3.5 kg of explosive detonated by impact or proximity fuses. The 65 projectile charges have a lethal radius of 6 meters. Cruising speed is Mach 1.6. The missile is delivered in a sealed container which is also the launch tube. Each launcher carries two launch tubes with 8 more inside the vehicle or shelter with automatic reloading in 10 seconds. For defense of fixed sites such as airfields the shelter Roland can be integrated in the CORAD (Co-ordinated Roland Air Defense) system which can include a surveillance radar, a Roland Co-ordination Center, 8 Roland fire units and up to 8 guns. =Fire units= * ' ‚Äì The initial fair-weather, daylight-only, version used by the French and Spanish armies on the AMX-30R chassis with entry into service in 1976. Roland 1 can also fire the Roland 2 and Roland 3 missiles. * ' ‚Äì This is the all-weather version mounted on the AMX-30R chassis (France and others), the Marder chassis (Germany, FlaRakPz 1, Heer, and others) and also as a shelter mount in either a static location or mounted on a 6√ó6 or 8√ó8 all-terrain truck (Germany, Roland FRR, Luftwaffe and Bundesmarine, and others). Euromissile, MaK, IBH and Blohm and Voss of Germany in 1983 proposed the Leopard 1 tank chassis as a carrier for the Roland system to appeal to those countries who already used the Leopard I tank. Roland 2 can also fire the Roland 3 missile. * ' ‚Äì Selected in 1975 as the forward air defense system for U.S. Army divisions, the first missiles were delivered in 1977 with the first firing from the XM975 launcher vehicle (a modified M109 howitzer chassis) taking place in September 1978. (Prior to late 1977 it was planned to use a version of the M520 Goer as the launcher vehicle.) American Roland was essentially Roland 2 with a longer-ranged American-made search radar. The palletized fire unit could be installed and rapidly removed from the XM975 chassis, installed on a truck or used as a static emplacement. Problems with technology transfer and rising costs (ostensibly at least, institutional resistance within the U.S. Army/DOD and Congress to using a 'foreign' weapons system may have actually played more of a role) killed the program and only 27 fire units and 600 missiles were built for one battalion in the Army National Guard, mounted on M812 flatbed trucks. With the failure of the M247 Sergeant York the U.S. Army leased 5 German Roland systems for evaluation as a possible replacement. * ' ‚Äì Paladin was the Hughes/Euromissile submission for the US Army's Line of Sight, Forward-Heavy requirement. It proposed using the XM957 for trials, with production vehicles to use the Bradley chassis. * ' ‚Äì As part of the development process for the Roland 3 missile, Euromissile developed an upgraded launcher with 4 ready to fire missiles.ForecastInternational * ' ‚Äì Glaive was a Franco-German programme under which Euromissile would develop a revised Roland fire unit for use with the RM5 missile. This would add an integrated thermal sighting system with laser rangefinder allowing for night/all-weather operation without using the radar. Contracts were issued in 1989 with the system intended to enter service in 1996. However, development of RM5 was cancelled in 1991. * (upgrade) ‚Äì This system was an upgrade of existing French Roland 1/2 systems to maintain them in service through 2010. It included fitting the BBKS operator consoles and replacing the existing optical sight with the Glaive thermal imaging unit. France had a requirement to update 54 AMX30-based fire units and 20 shelter units with this new equipment. The upgraded fire unit could use either the existing Roland missile or the new Roland 3 missile. * ' ‚Äì Conversion of existing French Roland 2 systems into a shelter-mounted version of the M3S standard. France procured 20 trailer-borne systems. France intended the shelterised variants for use with air-transported rapid-deployment forces.The upgraded fire unit could user either the existing Roland missile or the new Roland 3 missile. * ' ‚Äì LVB, Luftverlastbarkeit, air-transportable. The Luftwaffe acquired 10 truck-mounted versions, similar to Roland CAROL, with integration into the Heeres Flugabwehr Aufkl√§rungs-und F√ºhrungssystem (HFLaAF√ºSys) air-defence command and control system. As with France, Germany intended the shelterised variants for use with air-transported rapid- deployment forces. The upgraded fire unit could user either the existing Roland missile or the new Roland 3 missile. * ' ‚Äì NDV, NutzungsDauerVerl√§ngert, Extended Service Life. This was a German parallel to the French M3S, being developed by LFK GmbH for the German government. The control system was to be digitized and integrated into the HFLaAF√ºSys air- defence command and control system, with Roland 3 missile integration. Germany had a requirement to upgrade 84 Army (FlaRakPz 1A2) and 40 Luftwaffe (FlaRakRad) fire units. Trials had been completed in 2003 when Germany decided to withdraw Roland from use. * Roland M3S (new build) ‚Äì The prototype for this next-generation Roland system was completed in 1992 and was offered to meet the air defense requirements of Turkey and Thailand. The prototype was a shelter installed on the chassis of the American M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System and featured a then Dassault Electronique Rodeo 4 or a Thomson CSF (now Thales) search radar. Roland M3S can be operated by one man although 2 are necessary for sustained operation and the operator can select radar, TV or optronic (FLIR) tracking. Roland M3S has 4 instead of 2 missile containers in the ready-to-fire position but only the 2 lower positions can be automatically reloaded. In addition to the original Roland missile Roland M3S could use the Roland 3 missile, or the VT1 missile of the Crotale missile system. Additionally the upper launch containers could be replaced by 2 pairs of launchers for the Mistral missile or the standard Roland missile container could be adapted to carry four FIM-92 Stinger missiles to increase the system's ability to rapidly engage multiple targets in a saturation attack. * / ‚Äì From 1969 Euromissile studied Roland as a possible naval weapon for shipboard installation. Originally known as Roland MX and later as Jason, the standard twin launcher (without search radar) with two below-decks 8-round reloading drums could be installed on a standard sized module that was featured in several Blohm & Voss MEKO frigate proposals of the 1970s. No prototype or production systems were built with attention turning early on to an abortive vertically launched missile. =Missile variants= * Roland 1/2 ‚Äì The initial missile for the Roland system, entering production in 1977. Roland has a speed of 550 m/s and a range of 6.2 km. Roland 1 and 2 missiles have identical statistics but differ in tracking modes, Roland 1 being optically tracked, while Roland 2 missiles incorporate a continuous wave beacon to allow automatic radar tracking. * ‚Äì An upgraded missile which entered production in 1988 with speed increased from 550 m/s to 620 m/s and range increased from 6.3 to 8.5 km with maximum effective altitude increased to 6,000 m. Warhead size is also increased to 9.1 kg with 84 hollow-charges. Response time for the first target is quoted as 6‚Äì8 seconds with 2‚Äì6 seconds for subsequent targets. The Roland 3 missile can be used by all Roland systems. * () ‚Äì This was a joint project between the then Matra and Aerospatiale of France and MBB of Germany begun in 1987 for a missile with increased speed and range. RM5 was designed to achieve speeds of 1,600 m/s (Mach 5.0) with the range increased to 10 km. The RM5 warhead had an 11 kg warhead with dual detonation modes, able to produce either large, high energy fragments for use against armoured targets, or larger numbers of smaller fragments for use against small targets. The companies had committed to only the preliminary design phase and when Germany and France opted not to fund full scale development in 1991 development of RM-5 ceased. * VT1 ‚Äì In September 1991 Euromissile and the then Thomson CSF (now Thales) agreed to integrate the VT1 missile of the Crotale NG system into the Roland 3 system with retrofitting of French and German Roland fire units from 1996. Thales subsequently revoked the Euromissile license, but was ordered to pay Euromissile $109n in a subsequent court case. * ‚Äì HFK/KV was a BGT proposed alternative to VT1. It was a hypersonic missile with a speed of over Mach 5, intended to reach maximum range of 12 km in only 60% of the time taken by VT1. Guidance was to be inertial with terminal infra-red homing. Current systems are capable of launching Roland 2, Roland 3 or VT1 missiles. Roland's latest upgraded versions have limited ability to counter incoming low RCS munitions (large-caliber heavyweight rockets).

In configuration it would have been very similar to the AMX-30R. American Roland on the M109 chassis was built in prototype form but production systems were rather hastily installed on 6√ó6 flatbed trucks. In the late 1980s there was an attempt to revive the American Roland program with the Paladin submission to the U.S. Army's LOS-F-H (Line Of Sight - Forward - Heavy) battlefield air defense program. This new version of the American Roland system would have used the existing XM975 vehicle for testing & evaluation purposes, with production systems being fitted on a new modified M2 Bradley chassis. An airliftable shelter named Roland CAROL has also been developed, which is a 7.8t container that can be deployed on the ground to protect fixed assets like airfields or depots or fitted on an ACMAT truck.  Users  * Initial French requirements were for 144 Roland 1 and 70 Roland 2 systems with 10,800 missiles for the French Army, all installed on the AMX-30 tank chassis known as the AMX-30R. 181 systems (83 Roland 1 and 98 Roland 2) were eventually procured. The French Army has subsequently converted 20 of its Roland 2 all-weather systems to the Carole air-mobile shelter mounted system. These are used by the 54th Roland Regiment of the French Reaction Force for rapid deployment on short notice anywhere in the world.Jane's Land Based Air Defense Three of the four Artillery Regiments which operated Roland have been disbanded and the 4th (54 Regiment) has been converted to the Mistral (missile). Thus it is likely Roland has been withdrawn from French service. * was to buy 12,200 missiles 340 Roland 2 fire units installed on the Marder (IFV) chassis to fully replace the towed Bofors 40 mm guns systems and Contraves Super Fledermaus fire control systems in service with the Bundeswehr Corps-level air defense regiments. Each regiment would have 36 fire units in 3 batteries of 12. Eventually 140 fire units were procured and equipped 3 regiments with one assigned to each army corps. The Luftwaffe had a requirement for 200 Roland 2 shelter systems mounted on MAN 8√ó8 trucks for the close-in defense of airfields and as mobile gap-fillers for the MIM-23 HAWK SAM systems. 95 systems were eventually procured from the mid-1980s with 27 of those used to defend American air bases in Germany. In 1998‚Äì99 10 Roland LVB systems were installed on MAN 6√ó6 trucks to be air- transportable in the Transall C-160 for the German rapid reaction forces. The German Navy also procured 20 truck-mounted shelter systems for defense of naval bases. In February 2003 the Bundeswehr cancelled a planned upgrade of Roland and announced it would phase-out all of its Roland systems. This was completed by the end of 2005. The Luftwaffe and Navy have also withdrawn Roland and it is no longer employed by Germany. The German Army will replace Roland with the new and much more capable development: LFK NG). A battery of German systems have been passed on to Slovenia.Army Technology * On January 9, 1975 the Army selected Roland 2 as the winner of its SHORADS (Short-Range Air Defense System) competition to replace the MIM-72 Chaparral and M163 VADS divisional air defense systems with a requirement for more than 500 fire units to be designated the MIM-115. Hughes Aircraft and Boeing Aerospace were contracted to develop American Roland which would have been installed in a removable module on the M109 howitzer chassis. The American system used the European fire control system with an American search radar of greater range and enhanced ECCM capability. Initial production of fire units to equip 4 battalions and 1,000 missiles (against an anticipated requirement for 14,000) was approved in October 1978 but subsequently reduced to just 1 battalion. Difficulties in technology transfer, integration and commonality difficulties and rising costs meant only a single Army National Guard battalion (part of the 200th Air Defense Artillery Regiment) was ever equipped with the type, with the 27 launchers and 600 missiles installed on 6√ó6 flatbed trucks instead of tracked carriers. The XMIM-115 was never type-classified and served for less than a decade, being retired in 1988. * purchased 4 Roland shelter- mounted systems for static defense of fixed installations and one of these was deployed to defend Stanley airfield during the Falklands War with Britain in 1982. This system fired 8 out of the 10 missiles it was deployed with and is credited with shooting down one Royal Navy Sea Harrier Jump Jet and two 1,000 lb general-purpose bombs. This system was captured intact by the British and taken back to Britain. * purchased 4 Roland 2 systems on the German Marder chassis along with 50 missiles, all of which were retired from service in 2001. The Marder-Roland units bought by the Brazilian Army in the late '70s were retired in 2001 and are now on display at Museu Militar Conde de Linhares in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. * purchased 6 Roland 2 shelter mounted systems although some sources at the time indicated 8 systems. * acquired 16 Roland 2 systems on the AMX-30R chassis. An option for a further 16 was not taken up. * acquired 9 Roland 1 and 9 Roland 2 systems on the AMX-30R chassis and 414 missiles for defense of its armored field formations equipping the 71st Air Defense Regiment. Each battery has 2 Roland 1 and 2 Roland 2 systems with one system of each type held for tests and training. * is believed to have received 100 shelter-mounted Roland 2 on MAN 8√ó8 trucks and 13 self-propelled systems on the AMX-30R chassis during the 1980‚Äì88 Iran‚ÄìIraq War and they first went into action in 1982 claiming a F-4E Phantom and F-5E Tiger that year. Roland is believed to have shot down 2 Panavia Tornado aircraft during Operation Desert Storm and an A10 Thunderbolt during the Iraq War. As a result of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 these systems may no longer be in service. * In 1986 ordered 3 self-propelled Roland 2 systems on the AMX-30R chassis and 6 shelter-mounted systems with deliveries completed in 1989. Combat use On 1 June 1982, during the Falklands War, Sea Harrier n¬∫ XZ456 was shot down south of Stanley by members of the GADA 601, an Argentine antiaircraft unit deployed in the area.Smith, Gordon: Battle Atlas of the Falklands War 1982. Lulu.com, 2006, page 97. . The launcher, one of four examples delivered to Argentina, was captured in fairly intact condition by the British around Port Stanley after the surrender. It was taken back to Britain as a valuable prize and studied in detail. It is believed that an Iraqi Roland missile succeeded in shooting down an American A-10 Thunderbolt II at the beginning of the Iraq War, during the Battle of Baghdad. Rolandgate In October 2003, controversy erupted between Poland and France when Polish forces from the Multinational force in Iraq found four French Roland surface-to-air missiles. Polish and international press reported that Polish officers claimed these missiles had been manufactured in 2003. France pointed out that it had never sold weapons to Iraq after July 1990 in violation of the embargo. Polish authorities would later remark that the four missiles were manufactured in 1984, and that the 2003 date was the last time when Iraqi personnel had serviced them. Investigations by the Polish authorities came to the conclusion that the persons responsible for the scandal were low level commanders. Wojskowe S≈Çu≈ºby Informacyjne, the Polish Army's intelligence unit, had not verified their claims before they were leaked to the press. Poland apologized to France for the scandal, but these allegations against France worsened the already somewhat strained relationships between the two countries. The entire incident was sarcastically called \\"Rolandgate\\" by the Polish media, using the unofficial naming conventions of US political scandals after Watergate.

It states \\"All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation\\". This principle applies generally to the syntax of object- oriented programming languages. In simpler form, it states that there should be no syntactical difference between working with an attribute, pre-computed property, or method/query of an object. While most examples focus on the \\"read\\" aspect of the principle (i.e., retrieving a value), Meyer shows that the \\"write\\" implications (i.e., modifying a value) of the principle are harder to deal with in his monthly column on the Eiffel programming language official website. Explanation The problem being addressed by Meyer involves the maintenance of large software projects or software libraries. Sometimes when developing or maintaining software it is necessary, after much code is in place, to change a class or object in a way that transforms what was simply an attribute access into a method call. Programming languages often use different syntax for attribute access and invoking a method, (e.g., versus ). The syntax change would require, in popular programming languages of the day, changing the source code in all the places where the attribute was used. This might require changing source code in many different locations throughout a very large volume of source code. Or worse, if the change is in an object library used by hundreds of customers, each of those customers would have to find and change all the places the attribute was used in their own code and recompile their programs. Going the reverse way (from method to simple attribute) really was not a problem, as one can always just keep the function and have it simply return the attribute value. Meyer recognized the need for software developers to write code in such a way as to minimize or eliminate cascading changes in code that result from changes which convert an object attribute to a method call or vice versa. For this he developed the Uniform Access Principle. Many programming languages do not strictly support the UAP but do support forms of it. Properties, which are provided in a number of programming languages, address the problem Meyer was addressing with his UAP in a different way. Instead of providing a single uniform notation, properties provide a way to invoke a method of an object while using the same notation as is used for attribute access. The separate method invocation syntax is still available.  UAP example  If the language uses the method invocation syntax it may look something like this. // Assume print displays the variable passed to it, with or without parens // Set Foo's attribute 'bar' to value 5. Foo.bar(5) print Foo.bar() When executed, should display : 5 Whether or not invokes a function or simply sets an attribute is hidden from the caller. Likewise whether simply retrieves the value of the attribute, or invokes a function to compute the value returned, is an implementation detail hidden from the caller. If the language uses the attribute syntax the syntax may look like this. Foo.bar = 5 print Foo.bar Again, whether or not a method is invoked, or the value is simply assigned to an attribute is hidden from the calling method.  Problems  However, UAP itself can lead to problems, if used in places where the differences between access methods are not negligible, such as when the returned value is expensive to compute or will trigger cache operations.  Language examples = Ruby = Consider the following y = Egg.new(\\"Green\\") y.color = \\"White\\" puts y.color Now the Egg class could be defined as follows class Egg attr_accessor :color def initialize(color) @color = color end end The above initial code segment would work fine with the Egg being defined as such. The Egg class could also be defined as below, where color is instead a method. The calling code would still work, unchanged if Egg were to be defined as follows. class Egg def initialize(color) @rgb_color = to_rgb(color) end def color to_color_name(@rgb_color) end def color=(color) @rgb_color = to_rgb(color) end private def to_rgb(color_name) ..... end def to_color_name(color) .... end end Note how even though \`color\` looks like an attribute in one case and a pair of methods in the next, the interface to the class remains the same. The person maintaining the Egg class can switch from one form to the other without fear of breaking any caller's code. Ruby follows the revised UAP, the \`attr_accessor :color\` only acts as syntactic sugar for generating accessor/setter methods for \`color\`. There is no way in Ruby to retrieve an instance variable from an object without calling a method on it. Strictly speaking, Ruby does not follow Meyer's original UAP in that the syntax for accessing an attribute is different from the syntax for invoking a method. But here, the access for an attribute will always actually be through a function which is often automatically generated. So in essence, either type of access invokes a function and the language does follow Meyer's revised Uniform Access Principle. = Python = Python properties may be used to allow a method to be invoked with the same syntax as accessing an attribute. Whereas Meyer's UAP would have a single notation for both attribute access and method invocation (method invocation syntax), a language with support for properties still supports separate notations for attribute and method access. Properties allow the attribute notation to be used, but to hide the fact that a method is being invoked instead of simply retrieving or setting a value. As such, Python leaves the option of adherence to UAP up to the individual programmer. The built-in function provides a simple way to decorate any given method in attribute access syntax, thus abstracting away the syntactical difference between method invocations and attribute accesses.Official Python Docs, built- in functions In Python, we may have code that access an object that could be defined such that weight and color are simple attributes as in the following ''' >>> egg = Egg(4.0, \\"white\\") >>> egg.color = \\"green\\" >>> print(egg) Egg(4.0, green) ''' class Egg: def __init__(self, weight, color) -> None: self.weight = weight self.color = color def __str__(self) -> str: return f'{__class__.__name__}({self.weight}, {self.color})' Or the Egg object could use properties, and invoke getter and setter methods instead # ...(snip)... class Egg: def __init__(self, weight_oz: float, color_name: float) -> None: self.weight = weight_oz self.color = color_name @property def color(self) -> str: Color of the Egg return to_color_str(self._color_rgb) @color.setter def color(self, color_name: str) -> None: self._color_rgb = to_rgb(color_name) @property def weight(self) -> float: Weight in Ounces return self._weight_gram / 29.3 @weight.setter def weight(self, weight_oz: float) -> None: self._weight_gram = 29.3 * weight_oz # ...(snip)... { class=\\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\" Snipped codes are as following:  import webcolors # class Egg: def to_color_str(rgb: webcolors.IntegerRGB) -> str: try: return webcolors.rgb_to_name(rgb) except ValueError: return webcolors.rgb_to_hex(rgb) def to_rgb(color_name: str) -> webcolors.IntegerRGB: try: return webcolors.name_to_rgb(color_name) except ValueError: return webcolors.hex_to_rgb(color_name) if __name__  \\"__main__\\": import doctest doctest.testmod() } Regardless of which way is defined, the calling code can remain the same. The implementation of can switch from one form to the other without affecting code that uses the Egg class. Languages which implement the UAP have this property as well. = C# = The C# language supports class properties, which provide a means to define and operations (getters and setters) for a member variable. The syntax to access or modify the property is the same as accessing any other class member variable, but the actual implementation for doing so can be defined as either a simple read/write access or as functional code. public class Foo { private string _name; // Property public int Size { get; // Getter set; // Setter } // Property public string Name { get { return _name; } // Getter set { _name = value; } // Setter } } In the example above, class contains two properties, and . The property is an integer that can be read (get) and written (set). Similarly, the property is a string that can also be read and modified, but its value is stored in a separate (private) class variable . Omitting the operation in a property definition makes the property read-only, while omitting the operation makes it write-only. Use of the properties employs the UAP, as shown in the code below. public Foo CreateFoo(int size, string name) { var foo = new Foo(); foo.Size = size; // Property setter foo.Name = name; // Property setter return foo; } = C++ = C++ has neither the UAP nor properties, when an object is changed such that an attribute (color) becomes a pair of functions (). Any place in that uses an instance of the object and either sets or gets the attribute value ( or ) must be changed to invoke one of the functions. ( or ). Using templates and operator overloading, it is possible to fake properties, but this is more complex than in languages which directly support properties. This complicates maintenance of C++ programs. Distributed libraries of C++ objects must be careful about how they provide access to member data. = JavaScript = JavaScript has had support for computed properties since 2009.w3schools.com, Javascript Accessors = Next Generation Shell = In Next Generation Shell, accessing object fields is done through the \`.\` syntax, similar to other programming languages. Consistent with the rest of the language, the syntax is a shortcut for invoking a method. \`myobj.myfield\` is interpreted as a call to method \`.\` with arguments \`myobj\` and \`myfield\`. The built-in implementation of \`.\` returns the value of the field from the memory location dedicated exclusively to the given field of the specific object instance. To customize the behaviour of \`.\` for a particular type, one should define a method named \`.\` for that type. Similarly, \`.=\` method is called for \`myobj.myfield = myval\` syntax. The following example demonstrates default behavior of the \`.\` and \`.=\` methods. type Egg F init(e:Egg, color:Str) { e.color = color } e = Egg(\\"Green\\") e.color = \\"White\\" echo(e.color) The following example demonstrates customized behavior of the \`.\` and \`.=\` methods. The code implements accessor for the \`color\` field. type Egg F init(e:Egg, color:Str) { e.rgb_color = RGBColor(color) } F .(e:Egg, field:Str) { guard field  'color' e.rgb_color.name() } F .=(e:Egg, field:Str, value:Str) { guard field  'color' e.rgb_color = RGBColor(value) } e = Egg(\\"Green\\") e.color = \\"White\\" echo(e.color) References Category:Articles with example Python (programming language) code Category:Software design Category:Programming paradigms Category:Programming principles ","title":"Uniform access principle"},{"id":"2278919","title":"Zhang Wentian"},{"id":"2278932","text":"mod_jk is an Apache module used to connect the Tomcat servlet container with web servers such as Apache, iPlanet, Sun ONE (formerly Netscape) and even IIS using the Apache JServ Protocol.

The loan amount is determined by the value of the property, and the value of the property is determined by an appraiser from the lending institution. Home equity loans are often used to finance major expenses such as home repairs, medical bills, or college education. A home equity loan creates a lien against the borrower's house and reduces actual home equity. Most home equity loans require good to excellent credit history, reasonable loan-to-value and combined loan-to-value ratios. Home equity loans come in two types: closed end (traditionally just called a home-equity loan) and open end (a.k.a. a home-equity line of credit). Both are usually referred to as second mortgages, because they are secured against the value of the property, just like a traditional mortgage. Home equity loans and lines of credit are usually, but not always, for a shorter term than first mortgages. Home equity loan can be used as a person's main mortgage in place of a traditional mortgage. However, one cannot purchase a home using a home equity loan, one can only use a home equity loan to refinance. In the United States until December 31, 2017, it was possible to deduct home equity loan interest on one's personal income taxes. As part of the 2018 Tax Reform bill signed into law, interest on home equity loans will no longer be deductible on income taxes in the United States. There is a specific difference between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). A HELOC is a line of revolving credit with an adjustable interest rate whereas a home equity loan is a one time lump-sum loan, often with a fixed interest rate. With a HELOC the borrower can choose when and how often to borrow against the equity in the property, with the lender setting an initial limit to the credit line based on criteria similar to those used for closed-end loans. Like the closed-end loan, it may be possible to borrow up to an amount equal to the value of the home, minus any liens. These lines of credit are available up to 30 years, usually at a variable interest rate. The minimum monthly payment can be as low as only the interest that is due. Typically, the interest rate is based on the prime rate plus a margin. Fees A brief list of fees that may apply for home equity loans: * Appraisal fees * Originator fees * Title fees * Stamp duties * Arrangement fees * Closing fees * Early pay-off fee * Inactivity fee * Annual or Membership fee Surveyor and conveyor or valuation fees may also apply to loans but some may be waived. The survey or conveyor and valuation costs can often be reduced, provided one finds a licensed surveyor to inspect the property considered for purchase.

Ogden is perhaps best known today as the defendant in Gibbons v. Ogden which destroyed the monopoly power of steamboats on the Hudson River in 1824. Early life Ogden was born in Elizabethtown (known today as \\"Elizabeth\\") in the Province of New Jersey. He was the son of Robert Ogden, a lawyer and public official who served as Speaker of the New Jersey lower house immediately preceding the Revolution, and Phebe (n√©e Hatfield) Ogden. Ogden's brother Matthias Ogden (1754‚Äì1791) was a Revolutionary War soldier and his nephew, Daniel Haines also served as Governor of New Jersey on two separate occasions. Ogden, a Presbyterian, graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1773, and served as a grammar school tutor from 1773 to 1775. Career In the American Revolutionary War, Ogden was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st New Jersey Regiment; his older brother Matthias Ogden was the lieutenant colonel. Aaron Ogden served in various roles through the war, seeing action and rising to the rank of brigade major. In 1778, he visited the house also occupied by the family of diarist Sally Wister, who described him as \\"a genteel young fellow, with an aquiline nose.\\"Sally Wister, ‚Äò‚ÄòSally Wister's Journal: A True Narrative: Being a Quaker Maiden's Account of Her Experiences with Officers of the Continental Army, 1777‚Äì1779‚Äô‚Äô. Applewood Books, Bedford, Massachusetts, 1994. Entry for May 11, 1778. He was wounded at the siege of Yorktown in 1781. Ogden was an original member of the New Jersey Society of the Cincinnati. He served as the Society's President General from 1829 until his death in 1839. =Political career= After the war, Ogden studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1784. He commenced practice in Elizabeth and served as a presidential elector in the 1796 electoral college that elected John Adams. He was clerk of Essex County from 1785‚Äì1803, and was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Schureman and served from February 28, 1801 to March 3, 1803. He lost his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1802. In 1803, Ogden was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he served until 1812. Ogden was elected trustee of the College of New Jersey (later to become Princeton University) in 1803, a post in which he served until his death. In 1812, Ogden was elected as Governor of New Jersey in a wave of Federalist victories across the state due to opposition to the War of 1812. Ogden had been nominated by his Federalist colleagues as governor many times before, but the Republican majority who elected the governor held the majority from 1803 to 1812. During his term as Governor, \\"funds were secured for the military's use in the war against Britain.\\" After running unsuccessfully for reelection, the Federalists were voted out of the majority and with them, Ogden retired from political life. Ogden was nominated by President James Madison as major general of the Army in 1813, but declined the appointment. =Steamboat operations= In 1811, he became engaged in steamboat navigation by building the steamboat Sea Horse to run between Elizabeth and New York City. In 1812, under Livingston v. Van Ingen, the courts chose to upheld a steamboat monopoly over the Hudson River. In 1813, the New York State Legislature further upheld the monopoly created by Chancellor Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, who had designed the steamboat, so Ogden agreed to pay them for a ten-year monopoly to run his line. As a result of a feud with his neighbor and competing steamboat operator, Thomas Gibbons, Ogden was a defendant in the Gibbons v. Ogden case that denied New York State's attempted monopoly on steamboat operation between New York and New Jersey. In the case, which eventually was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1824, Ogden was represented by Samuel L. Southard and Joseph Hopkinson, Livingston by Thomas Addis Emmet, and Gibbons by Daniel Webster and U.S. Attorney General William Wirt. =Later life= Ogden moved to Jersey City in 1829 and resumed the practice of law. It was in Jersey City where he was arrested for debt and sent to debtors' prison. He was released several months later under an act of the Legislature that provided \\"that no Revolutionary officer or soldier should be imprisoned for debt. The law was so framed as to cover the case of Col. Ogden, and he was released.\\" In 1830, he was appointed as Collector of Customs of Jersey City, an office created specifically for him by an act of Congress, and served until his death in Jersey City. Personal life Aaron Ogden Monument, First Presbyterian Churchyard, Elizabeth, NJ Ogden was married to Elizabeth Chetwood (1766‚Äì1826), the daughter of John Chetwood, an attorney, and Mary (n√©e Emott) Chetwood (d. 1786). She was the older sister of U.S. Representative and Mayor of Elizabeth William Chetwood (1771‚Äì1857). Together, they were the parents of: * Mary Chetwood Ogden (1789‚Äì1863), who was married to George Clinton Barber. * Phebe Ann Ogden (1790‚Äì1865), who served as Vice Regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. * Matthias Ogden (1792‚Äì1860), who married Lucille Robert. * John Robert Ogden (1794‚Äì1845), who did not marry. * Elias Bailey Dayton Ogden (1797‚Äì1799), who died young. * Elias Bailey Dayton Ogden (1800‚Äì1865), who was named after his deceased brother. Elias, who married three times, served as an associate justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1842 until his death in 1865. * Aaron Ogden Jr. (1803‚Äì1803), who died young. Ogden died in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 19, 1839. Ogden's body is interred at the burial ground of the First Presbyterian Church of Elizabeth. =Descendants= Through his son Elias, he was the grandfather of Frederick Beasley Ogden (1827‚Äì1893), who served as Mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey from 1865 to 1867; Aaron Ogden (1828‚Äì1896), who married Harriet Emily Travers; and Susan Dayton Ogden (1831‚Äì1878), who married William Shepard Biddle, and were the parents of U.S. Army general John Biddle.

Cornell was fascinated by the star of East of Borneo, an actress named Rose Hobart, and named his short film after her. The piece consists of snippets from East of Borneo combined with shots from a documentary film of an eclipse.  Creation  By chance, Cornell bought a 16mm print of East of Borneo at a junk shop. To make the 77-minute film less tedious for repeated viewings by himself and his brother, Cornell would occasionally cut some parts, rearrange others, or add pieces of nature films, until it was condensed to its final-length of 19 minutes, mostly featuring shots of the lead actress, with whom Cornell had become obsessed. As such, it might be classified as one of the earliest fanvids, which often feature character studies from stock footage from popular films and television programs.  Screenings  When Cornell screened the film, he projected it through a piece of blue glass and slowed the speed of projection to that of a silent film. Cornell removed the original soundtrack and added \\"Porte Alegre\\" and \\"Belem Bayonne\\", two songs from Nestor Amaral's album Holiday in Brazil, a record that Cornell had also found at a junk shop. The film was first shown in 1936 at Julien Levy's New York City gallery in a matinee program featuring short films from Cornell's collection. The program, which Levy called \\"Goofy Newsreels\\", took place around the same time as the first exhibition of surrealist art at the Museum of Modern Art. Salvador Dal√≠ was in the audience, but halfway through the film, he knocked over the projector in a rage. ‚ÄúMy idea for a film is exactly that, and I was going to propose it to someone who would pay to have it made,‚Äù he said. \\"I never wrote it down or told anyone, but it is as if he had stolen it.\\" Other versions of Dal√≠'s accusation tend to the more poetic: \\"He stole it from my subconscious!\\" or even \\"He stole my dreams!\\"Program Notes by Andy Ditzler (2005) After the Dal√≠ incident, Cornell did not show the film again until the 1960s, when, at the behest of Jonas Mekas, it was screened again for a public audience. When the first print was made from Cornell's original in 1969, Cornell chose a 'rose' tint instead of the normal blue.  Critical reception and accolades  In 2001, Rose Hobart was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". It was also among J. Hoberman's ten votes in both the 2002 and 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the world's greatest films.

It is the real life setting of the BBC series Peaky Blinders, and home to Birmingham City and Coventry City's ground, St Andrew's. It should not be confused with nearby Bordesley Green. History In Old English Bord's leah means 'Bord's clearing'. Bord may indicate 'boards' or 'planks', a place in the forest clearing where timber products could be obtained, but it is also a male personal name. Here, perhaps as early as the 7th century, Bord found or made a clearing in the forest to grow his crops and tend his stock.50px This content is available under the Attribution 2.0 UK: England & Wales (CC BY 2.0 UK) Licence Historically, a hamlet and chapelry, in the parish and union of Aston, Birmingham, part of the Hemlingford hundred in the county of Warwick, adjoined the town of Birmingham. The hamlet was originally very small, consisting only of a few scattered dwelling-houses, such as Stratford Place, still standing at Camp Hill and the Old Crown in Deritend both of which are of timber frame-work and plaster, with projecting upper stories, although those of Stratford Place have since been under-filled in brick. By 1226, Bordesley was held in demesne by the overlords of the other manors in Aston parish and by the second half of the 13th century it was the centre of a court leet for the neighbouring vills. In 1291 it was certified as containing 61 acres of demesne, with meadows in Bordesley and in Duddeston and Overton (Water Orton); there were 4 freeholders, each with a messuage and a half-yardland, and 78 others without houses holding land newly brought under cultivation, and 16 customary tenants holding 6¬Ω yardlands; the total value was ¬£27 12s. 2d. In 1390 a settlement joined the manors of Bordesley and Haybarn, henceforward usually linked together. Thereafter the manor passed through the same ownership and divisions as the overlordship of the other manors in Aston parish. It appears to have been acquired by Sir Charles Holte by 1706, and to have descended with Aston, being in the hands of a later Sir Charles Holte in 1770. The Georgian house known as Bordesley Hall, which stood in a park of 6 acres south of the Coventry Road near its junction with Bordesley High Street, may have been the successor of a medieval manor-house. The first series Ordnance Survey map places the hall in the area of Albert and Bolton Roads,Ordnance Survey. Map 1\\", (1st edn.) this location being supported by the image of the ruins drawn by P H Witon Jnr in 1791 which places it on an elevated site. Built in 1767 for the manufacturer and banker John Taylor, to replace an existing manor house, it passed on his death in 1785, to his son John Taylor, and was burnt down during the Priestley Riots. Taylor claimed ¬£12670 as damages and was paid ¬£9902 but Hutton records that \\"the real loss of Mr Taylor amounted to upwards ¬£22,600,\\" or approximately ¬£2.4 million today (2017). It is reported that the house was rebuilt but sold off in 1840 for housing developments. However, Charles Pye writing of his visit to Birmingham in 1818 states that \\"having crossed the Warwick canal, the ruins of Bordesley house are in full view; they having continued in that state ever since the year 1791, when the house was demolished by an infuriated mob. The land by which it is surrounded has been parcelled out, and advertised to be let for building.\\" Due to its proximity to Birmingham, and lying on a main communications route it was natural that the town should grow outwards in this direction. Buildings had reached along Bordesley High Street, as far as the junction of the Coventry and Stratford roads and along the Stratford road about as far as Highgate Park by 1810John Kempson, Map of Birmingham 1810 and subsequently, in 1838, Bordesley became a suburb of Birmingham, and so developed through its trade, manufactures, and public institutions. By 1841 the population of Deritend and Bordesley had passed 18,000. Politics Bordesley is part of the Nechells Ward, and is currently represented at Birmingham City Council by three Labour councillors; Tahir Ali, Rashid Chauhdry and Yvonne Mosquito. Nationally, Bordesley is part of Birmingham, Ladywood constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2015 by Shabana Mahmood of the Labour Party.

In this context, remailing is a kind of email forwarding. SRS was devised in order to forward email without breaking the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), in 2003.  Background  In a number of cases, including change of email address and mailing lists, an MTA accepts an email message that is not destined to a local mailbox but needs to be forwarded. In such cases, the question arises of who deserves to receive any related bounce message. In general, that is either the author, or a person or other entity who administers the forwarding itself. Sending bounces to the author is administratively simpler and used to be accomplished by just keeping the original envelope sender. However, if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy () and the target MTA happens to enforce it, the forwarding transaction can be rejected. As a workaround, it is possible to synthesize on the fly a temporary bounce address that will direct any bounce back to the current MTA. The scheme provides for recovering the original envelope address, so that if a bounce does arrive, it can be forwarded along the reverse path‚Äîwith an empty envelope sender this time. While there are other workarounds, SRS is a fairly general one. Its notion of reversing the path resembles the original routing dispositions for email, see below. The rewriting scheme SRS is a form of variable envelope return path (VERP) inasmuch as it encodes the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. Consider ' forwarding a message originally destined to to his new address : ORIGINAL : : REWRITTEN : : The example above is adapted from Shevek. With respect to VERP, the local part () is moved after her domain name (), further adding a prefix (), a hash ('), and a timestamp ('). That reflects an operational difference: Eventual bounces back to a VERP address are handled within the rewriting domain, and forged messages can at most unsubscribe some users, a kind of abuse that hasn't seen significant exploits in the last decades. Instead, SRS aims at remailing a possible bounce back to Alice, so that forged bounces can become an alluring technique for injecting spam apparently originating from the rewriting sender. * The local part, in this case , is moved because it may contain equal signs (=), so putting it at an extremity of the rewritten local part makes the latter parsable. * The timestamp (') has a one-day resolution in order to make the address invalid after a few days. Computed as , it can be stored as a two base32 characters, with a recycling period of about 3.5 years. * The hash-based message authentication code (') is computed against a local secret, but only a part of it is used; for example, storing the first 4 characters of a base64 representation provides 24 bits of security. The hash is checked by the domain who generated it, in case a bounce arrives. * The prefix, , is meant to disambiguate regular addresses from rewritten ones; it is up to example.com to ensure that none of its users has an email address starting with . SRS provides for another prefix, , to be used for rewriting an already rewritten address, in a multi-hop scenario. If ' has to forward the message in turn, it can spare adding another timestamp and repeating the original local part (). That is, each new forwarder adds just its own hash (') and the domain name of the preceding forwarder: FURTHER REWRITTEN : : =Database alternative= Using a database can definitely control the growth of rewritten addresses, since it is sufficient to put just a unique key in the rewritten local part. It also allows for a certain amount of anonymity in the resending process, if this is desired. However, a database requires centralization and is a single point of failure. =Header field alternative= Another possibility is to store the long rewritten address somewhere in the message header. The = tag of a DKIM-Signature may be a good place, as such choice considerably improves the security. This technique has been just observed. Unless there is a backup mechanism, it can only work if the bounce message is in a standard format.  Historical background  Historically all mail transfer agents (MTAs) added their host name to the reverse path. In the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) this reverse path is also known as , but paths were also used before and outside of SMTP, e.g. as bang paths in UUCP and Usenet (NetNews). All news articles still contain a header, example: : The same information in an RFC 5321 e-mail envelope - that is the SMTP info like - would be: # : # : The 1st step reflects the sender, the 2nd step the next MTA, etc. In this example let's assume that the 2nd MTA forwards the mail to a 3rd MTA, where it is finally delivered. The final MTA is also known as Mail delivery agent (MDA), putting the mail into the mailbox of the recipient. The MDA transforms the reverse path into the known header field: : SMTP uses MX records for its forward routing. Explicit source routes as in... : ...to route mail from via MTA to MDA were cumbersome. To make things worse sometimes the new (1982) style of addresses was mixed with old UUCP bang paths in constructs like... ...and various other kludges. SMTP and MX records made all this essentially useless. Therefore, source routing was deprecated 1989 in RFC 1123. One special case in RFC 1123 are gateways from or to other networks like UUCP and NetNews, where the first sending MTA cannot reach the final receiver directly with TCP. It is solved by MX records and if necessary rewriting foreign addresses at the gateway. MX is an acronym for Mail eXchanger. Another special case are mailing lists, where the list server rewrites all reverse paths to its own error handling address for bounces (error messages) by recipients. The list server could automatically unsubscribe bouncing recipients. This type of address rewriting is known since RFC 821 and still used today (RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, updated the SMTP chapter in RFC 1123). Last but not least forwarding to another address always worked by rewriting the address in the forward path also known as , if and only if the forwarding MTA accepted the responsibility for both forwarding the mail and returning potential bounce messages to the sender. RFC 821 and all later SMTP specifications offer two result codes for this situation: * * For privacy reasons these result codes are today rarely used; they include the or . But the meaning and the effect of forwarding to third parties is identical for and respectively. As noted RFC 1123 deprecated source routing, that implicitly also deprecated the reverse routing of bounces. It was a relatively small Internet back in 1989, mail admins (postmasters) often knew each other and fixed problems on the fly. Routing bounce messages back via any forwarders was a waste of time and bandwidth if the MTA noting a problem (e.g. a rejection with a 5xx error code) could send the error message directly back to the MX of sender. Since RFC 1123 forwarders to third parties still rewrote the address, but kept the as is. As a side effect MTAs wishing to accept mail from forwarders generally accept any address. More than a decade later spammers started to abuse this flaw in post-1123 SMTP, today most mails are spam and most reverse paths are forged. Note that spammers typically forge working reverse paths, many MTAs reject mail if callback verification or other plausibility checks fail for the reverse path. RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, states that non-delivery reports (bounces) must be sent to the originator as indicated in the reverse path after an MTA accepted the responsibility for delivery. However, the bounce message may be suppressed when the original content is hostile (cf. spam or virus mail) or the message is forged (RFC 5321, Section 6). Note that all current forgery detection methods require the mailbox owner to supply information for them to work. Failing to supply the criteria should not make any bounce message classifiable as backscatter, although some people mistakenly think it should. Open relays and forwarders are in an unlucky position with regards to this issue, generally they can't guarantee that the address indicates the originator, and they also can't guarantee that final delivery will succeed. This SMTP problem caused as side effect of RFC 1123 is addressed by SPF, and the executive summary is SPF breaks forwarding - actually that's not the case, only asks receivers to check SPF at their border MTA, not later. Receivers can arrange their forwarding in a way that works with SPF with in essence three strategies: # not checking SPF behind their border, e.g. white list forwarders # just reject , resulting in a bounce () # rewrite the at the forwarder (as done by mailing lists) Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is one way for the third strategy.

The latter form of the name derives from \\"atten Eccheles\\", \\"belonging to the Eccheles\\", an Old English word meaning \\"land added to a village or estate\\".Ekwall, E. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960, p.169. The philologist Eilert Ekwall speculated that a more precise meaning could be \\"land added by clearing,\\" or \\"land added by draining a marsh\\".Ekwall, E.,\\"The English Place-Names Etchells, Nechells\\" in M√©langes de Philologie, offerts √† M. Johan Vising par ses √©l√®ves et ses amis scandinaves, √† l'occasion du soixante-dixi√®me anniversaire de sa naissance, Gothenburg: N.J Gumperts and Paris: E.Champion, 1925, 105-6. In the Middle English period, following the process of language change known as metanalysis, only the \\"n\\" in \\"atten\\" remained in oral usage and became assimilated to \\"Eccheles\\". So, n+Eccheles became the \\"Nechells\\" (pronunciation ) of modern usage. However, the pronunciation was also current, as indicated by the spelling of Tomlinson's Map of Duddeston and Netchells, published in 1758.Chinn, C. The Streets of Brum, Part 4. Studley:Brewin, 2007, p.3. This pronunciation was also to be heard in the 20th century amongst some older inhabitants of the area.Chinn, C. One Thousand Years of Brum. Birmingham: Birmingham Evening Mail, 1999, p. 103. The name \\"Nechells Green\\" originally referred to the triangle of land at the meeting point of the present Nechells Park Road, Nechells Place, Bloomsbury Street, Rocky Lane, Charles Arthur Street and Thimble Mill Lane. On Tomlinson's 1758 map the area was indeed shown as a village green surrounded by a few lanes and fields,Chinn, The Streets of Brum p.3, and a sparse population consisting of a handful of widely-spread homesteads.Chinn, C. One Thousand Years of Brum. Birmingham: Birmingham Evening Mail, 1999, p. 103-4.

Nechells became a densely populated area during the 19th century, with mass development of houses and factories taking place. Mass immigration occurred from Ireland. In 1868 it was described thus: :...a hamlet in the parish of Aston and borough of Birmingham, county Warwick. It is united with Duddeston, and forms a populous suburb of Birmingham. Here are extensive workshops for building railway carriages, also a lunatic asylum.

N., Colored Minorities in Birmingham, England. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 66(1), 1976, pp89-103. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2562021. By the 1950s, however, many of the homes in Nechells had been reduced to \\"slums\\" and were unfit for human habitation. People were living in homes without electricity, running water, bathrooms or indoor toilets. The Gas Works caused a continuous unpleasant smell. The bulk of the area had been designated as a redevelopment area in 1937, but its regeneration was put off by some 20 years due to World War II. The face of Nechells changed dramatically during the 1960s, with the decaying Victorian terraces being cleared and the area redeveloped with new houses and tower blocks. Some families remained in the new homes that had been built around Nechells, but there were insufficient new homes to rehouse all of the area's original residents, and as a result some families moved to new housing estates like Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood. The new homes were certainly a big improvement on their predecessors, but the area still suffered from rising unemployment and crime. The development of high rise flats in Nechells had actually started in the 1950s, and it was the home of Birmingham's very first tower block - Queens Tower, on Great Francis StreetBartlam, N. The Little Book of Birmingham. Stroud: The History Press, 2011, p.108. \\\\- which was completed in 1954 and is still standing today.Jones, P. \\"The suburban high flat in the post-war reconstruction of Birmingham, 1945‚Äì71\\". Urban History (32), pp.308-326 (2005). However, many of the tower blocks in the Nechells area were demolished in the 1990s to make way for new low rise private and rented housing. =The Siege of Austin Street= On Saturday 8th July 1961, the then vicar of St. Clement's, the Rev. Elwyn Evans, was called upon by police to assist them in negotiating with a man who had barricaded himself in his house and refused to come out until a clergyman was called. He had fired an unloaded air pistol from the window of his house in Austin Street. According to the Birmingham Post, several hundred people people had watched the police try to arrest the man who had effectively laid siege to the street. Rev. Evans eventually persuaded the man to give himself up and accompanied the unemployed man as he surrendered to the police. Rev. Evans, who served in Nechells from 1952‚Äì64,Crockford's Clerical Directory 1965, Oxford University Press, 1967, p. 384. told reporters that had been taking a bath when the police arrived at his vicarage on Stanley Road.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002134/19610710/522/0023 Austin Street itself, situated between Aston Church Road and Trevor Street at right angles to Nechells Park Road, no longer exists, having been built over by new housing. Industrial and Commercial Development Early evidence of industrial, or rather small-scale craft activity in Nechells is given on Tomlinson's 1758 map which shows a slitting mill used as a stage in the manufacture of nails situated at a point towards the northern end of what was to become Nechells Park Road. On Ordnance Survey 1:2500 maps of 1902 and 1904 there is much evidence of industry in the early 20th century: Nechells Chemical Works and Birmingham Paper Mill were located adjacent to the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal at the eastern end of Cattells Grove; a Tube Works, Stove Works and Varnish Works were situated in an area bounded by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, Holborn Hill and Long Acre; and a building shown as \\"Park Mills (Edge Tool)\\" is shown on Wharton Street, again adjoining the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal. Later in the 20th century Nechells was chosen as the location of two gasworks, in Windsor Street and Nechells Place,Demolition of Nechells gasometers, August 2015 Two coal-fired power stations were situated on land now occupied by the Star City complex. The first power station was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1923 and a larger plant, known as Nechells \\"B\\", opened in 1954. The B station had a capacity of 224 megawatts (MW) and generated 52.869 GWh of electricity in 1980-81. A small railway network was used by both power stations for the transport of coal from the main line railway at Saltley and within the plant. The power stations closed in 1982, but a steam locomotive used at the site, \\"Nechells No.4\\", has been preserved and is operating on the Chasewater Railway in StaffordshireNechells Power Station http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/misc/nechells-power-station.htmClawley, A. Birmingham Then and Now, Batsford, 2013, p.98 The second of the two gasworks was the setting - in an \\"obscure suburb on the eastern side of Birmingham\\", according to one historian,D.Sandbrook, State of Emergency - The Way We Were: Britain 1970-1974.

At the age of twenty and with no formal qualifications, Frederick William Lanchester so impressed the owner of the Forward Gas Engine Company of Birmingham that he was offered the position of assistant works manager at their factory near Bloomsbury Street where he made various improvements to the equipment produced by this company. Lanchester resigned from the company in 1893 and went on to produce the first all-British four-wheel petrol car.Dictionary of National Biography, \\"Lanchester, Frederick William\\", http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34388 A sculpture, the Lanchester Car Monument, was built in Bloomsbury Village Green to commemorate Lanchester's work.A.

This site opened in 1992, was expanded considerably in 1996 and now includes a business centre serving the Chinese community and a food superstore. Also on Thimble Mill Lane, the Aston Manor Brewery started production in 1993 and produces beer, cider and perry. It is capable of producing 24,000 bottles per hour.

The broad ethnic breakdown of the population is: Asian 13.5%; White 15%; Black 65%; Mixed 3.5%; and others 3%. The largest ethnic groups are: White British (12%); Pakistani (9%); African (60%) mainly Somali,Sudanese and Eritrean; Caribbean (8%) and Bangladeshi (11%). The Census also shows that Nechells has a young population with 29% of residents under 18 years old (compared with 25% in Birmingham as a whole). The median age of Nechells residents is 25 years as opposed to 32 years in Birmingham as a whole. Only 7% of people are 65 years or older (compared with 13% in Birmingham as a whole). More than half of the children growing up in Nechells are in families defined as being in child poverty. Whilst it is notable in Birmingham for being the area with the highest rate of unemployment, crime and poverty, it has been the focus of a great deal of urban regeneration by Birmingham City Council and the former Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation. However, a report published in 2010 by the Birmingham Public Health Information Team concluded that: *North Nechells, Bloomsbury and Duddeston has a young population compared with Birmingham overall *The area is made up of multicultural, mixed communities with crime and health problems *Life expectancy is much worse than the Birmingham average, along with self-reported health status and long term limiting illnesses *More people die young in North Nechells, Bloomsbury and Duddeston than Birmingham on average, mostly from: chronic liver disease including cirrhosis, suicide, injury undetermined and stroke *Mortality rates and admission rates (to hospital) are higher than the Birmingham average. Schools=Primary schools= Two primary schools in Nechells have acquired academy status. They are Nechells Primary E-ACT Academy (the successor to Nechells Junior and Infants school and Hutton Street Board School before that) and Nechells Church of England Academy (the successor to St Clement's Church of England Primary School which opened next to St Clement's Church in Stuart Street in 1859).Victoria County History of Warwickshire, Vol VII, p.529 =Secondary schools= Nechells Secondary Modern school, for pupils aged 11‚Äì16, which was incorporated into the existing Eliot Street Junior and Infants site after the passing of the 1944 Education Act, and with additional buildings on the adjoining Crompton Road, was closed and its buildings demolished in the 1980s. Nechells is currently served by Heartlands Academy, the successor to Heartlands High School and Duddeston Manor School before that. Transport Nechells is served by Duddeston railway station and Aston railway station. From 1856 to 1869, a station named \\"Bloomsbury and Nechells \\" was situated slightly to the north of the present Duddeston station.Quick, M.

Plans for baths to be constructed in the Nechells ward came about in 1900 when representatives from the ward pressured the council into providing public baths for the ward. However, the Birmingham Baths Committee were already committed to other projects in the city and were unable to immediately attend the matter. In 1903, a site at the corner of Nechells Park Road and Aston Church Road was acquired and in 1908, approval was given for the construction of baths on the site. Construction commenced that year and the baths were opened 22 June 1910. Facilities provided included a large swimming bath with a spectators' gallery and suites of private baths for men and women. The baths were immediately popular among the locals. Refurbishment work to the baths was completed in May 2007 by Welconstruct. It cost ¬£5.5 million, with funding from Advantage West Midlands, the Heritage Lottery Fund and ERDF.

History In 1952, Vimiera Recreation Grounds, a company associated with Eastwood Rugby, purchased 4 and a half acres of land a mile and a half north-east of Eastwood railway station for the construction of a sporting complex for Eastwood Rugby. At the time sporting clubs only had access to fields owned and maintained by suburban councils and this purchase was made possible by a loan from Colonel Tom Millner MC VD. The clubhouse and oval were built by volunteers and after 1963 and the development of dressing rooms, all home games were played at Marsfield. Additional land was bought in 1967 increasing the site to more than . The complex originally had 3 full sized playing fields which have been floodlit since 1969 and which were available for games and training. The grandstand was also constructed in 1969. Eastwood Rugby Club In 2000 Vimiera Recreation Grounds, the owners of T G Millner, signed a 99-year lease with North Ryde RSL Community Club which transferred control over the entire complex to the RSL. Following this transfer a number of changes occurred which included the RSL prohibiting rugby being played on the third field In 2017, VRG advised that the entire complex had been sold to North Ryde RSL.

It was founded by Barry Hogan in 2001 in preparation for the first All Tomorrow's Parties Festival, the line-up of which was picked by Mogwai and took place at Pontins, Camber Sands, England. Named after the song \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" by The Velvet Underground, the festival exhibited a tendency towards post- rock, indie rock, avant-garde music, and underground hip hop, along with more traditional rock fare presented in smaller venues than typical stadium performances. It was at first a sponsorship-free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans. It claimed to set itself apart from festivals like Reading or Glastonbury by staying intimate, non-corporate and fan-friendly. Another difference was the line-ups being chosen by significant bands or artists, resulting in unorthodox events which often combined acts of all sizes, eras, and genres. Locations and artists The festival took place in the UK, USA and Australia, and was curated by the following artists: Deerhunter, TV On The Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The National, The Drones, Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel), Battles, Caribou, Les Savy Fav, Amos, Animal Collective, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Jim Jarmusch, Pavement, The Flaming Lips, The Breeders, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Mike Patton & Melvins, My Bloody Valentine, Explosions In The Sky, Pitchfork Media, Portishead, Fennesz, Dirty Three, Thurston Moore, The Shins, Sleater Kinney, Dinosaur Jr., Devendra Banhart, Mudhoney, The Mars Volta, Vincent Gallo, Slint, Jake & Dinos Chapman, Stephen Malkmus, Mogwai, Tortoise, Shellac, Sonic Youth, Boards of Canada, Autechre, Modest Mouse, Cowboy Junkies, and Simpsons' creator Matt Groening. History The festival had its origins in the Bowlie Weekender, curated by Belle & Sebastian at Camber Sands in April 1999. Artists, usually musicians (but sometimes visual artists like Matt Groening, whose line-up featured in the Observer's list of the ten best festivals of the year, or Jake and Dinos Chapman) were asked to curate the festival by inviting their favourite performers to play. The idea was that it was akin to dipping into the curator's record collection, or as founder Barry Hogan described it, \\"ATP is like an excellent mix tape\\". In 2001 the organisation spawned ATP/Recordings, a record label originally created to bring out compilation albums related to its festivals. However the label eventually moved on from just doing compilations for the festival to sign and release singles and albums from artists including Threnody Ensemble, Bardo Pond, The Magic Band, Deerhoof, White Out, Death Vessel, The Drones, Fursaxa, The Scientists, Apse, Fuck Buttons, Alexander Tucker, Sleepy Sun, Spiritualized, Built To Spill, Autolux and most recently Tall Firs and Tennis. At the end of 2007 ATP/R launched series of double 7\\" singles called Custom Made, which would feature bands choosing four songs; one something old, one something new, one something borrowed (a cover version) and one something blue (artists were free to interpret this as they feel). Artists to release singles in this series were Australia's The Drones, Britain's Alexander Tucker and America's Deerhoof. In 2002, the festival expanded to the USA, and several events took place there in subsequent years. The organisation also became involved in booking stages at the Pitchfork Music Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, Spain. In 2008, All Tomorrow's Parties ran their first East Coast USA festival, which took place at Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club, Monticello, New York. In January 2009, the festival took place for the first time in Australia, with events in Brisbane, Sydney and Mount Buller (in Victoria) all curated by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. The organisation that put on these festivals also promoted concerts in London and the rest of the United Kingdom, curated the yearly Don't Look Back concert series and ran the record label ATP Recordings. All Tomorrow‚Äôs Parties, as with a number of modern festivals, embraced a variety of artistic genres. Most festival events featured art exhibitions and cinema programmes (in the USA, ATP collaborated with Criterion to present cinema highlighted by appearances from Paul Schrader and Jim Jarmusch), and others featured spoken word performances, stand-up comedy, and book clubs. In 2007 the curators allowed festival-goers to pick the line-up by organising a voting process for all ticketholders in the months running up to the event, and this was repeated in May 2009. The 2007 festival took place at Butlin's Minehead. In the years before 2013, when ATP announced they were ceasing to hold residential festivals in the UK, the festival took place up to three or four times a year in the UK (in May and then in December for the 'Nightmare Before Christmas'). UK festivals were planned to recommence in 2015, moving to Pontins Prestatyn. In 2009, Warp Films released a feature- length documentary about the festival named All Tomorrow's Parties. It premiered at the SXSW Film Festival, and then premiered in the UK at Edinburgh in June. In October 2009 the film was screened at a number of 'one night only' UK theatrical screenings also featuring live music from Les Savy Fav, who feature in the film and have long been mainstays of All Tomorrow's Parties line-ups. In 2010, ATP announced I'll Be Your Mirror, a series of events to take place in cities around the world named after the B-side to the original 1966 \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" single by the Velvet Underground. These events still involved a curator choosing all the music and films that play at the event, but without the holiday resort accommodation. The first event took place in Tokyo, Japan in February 2011. Significant past performances at ATP festivals include the reformations of The Magic Band, Television, The Jesus Lizard, Sleep, and Slint amongst others. All Tomorrow's Parties also presented the return of My Bloody Valentine with a series of worldwide live performances throughout 2008, the London concerts of which were named Time Out London's Gig Of The Year. =Financial difficulties= In 2012, the company running the events was put into liquidation, owing ¬£2.6 million to its creditors. The company's directors set up a new firm, Wilwall, but this also experienced difficulties, filing late accounts, incurring significant debts, and was subject to court judgements related to debt. A Grizzly Bear concert at Alexandra Palace was cancelled, as was its urban festival, Jabberwocky, the latter only 3 days before the event was due to take place. A festival hosted by Drive Like Jehu was to be held in Prestatyn in Wales in 2016, but this was moved to Manchester in England, before being cancelled. A few months later the company went in administration, and its scheduled festival in Iceland was cancelled.

The outlet of Big Moose Lake forms the North Branch in northern Herkimer County. The Middle Branch originates at the Fulton Chain Lakes in Old Forge. And the Southern Branch has its headwaters in Little Moose Lake in Hamilton County. The Middle and South branches merge in Mckeever, New York and become just Moose River. It flows generally westwardly through Herkimer County into Lewis County, reaching its confluence with the Black River in Lyons Falls.  Geography  Owing to its high gradient as it drops out of the mountains, The Moose is a favorite destination for whitewater rafters, kayakers and canoeists. There are three whitewater sections below McKeever with increasing degrees of difficulty. The Middle Moose is a Class II-III section of river from the gaging station in McKeever to Rock Island. The Lower is a Class III-V section from Rock Island to just above Fowlerville Falls, which is run commercially in early spring and includes drops such as Tannery, Froth Hole, Mixmaster and Miller's Falls. The Bottom Moose is a Class V+ section from Fowlerville on. In the Spring and Fall of each year, hundreds of whitewater paddlers descend on the Moose from all parts of the US and eastern Canada. The Bottom Moose (see below), in particular, is a favorite run for paddlers who enjoy Class-V whitewater. This run has several waterfalls, ranging from straightforward and easy to difficult and dangerous. Also because of its high gradient, there are several hydropower projects along the Moose's course.

Marsfield is located 16 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Ryde. Marsfield is often referred to as part of the North Shore. The suburb is noted for its proximity to a number of leading scientific and tertiary educational institutions such as Macquarie University, the Macquarie Park Business Park and Macquarie University Hospital. History The suburb's name is derived from Field of Mars, the original name in the early days of British colonisation of Australia, given to the area by Governor Phillip in 1792. =Aboriginal culture= The whole area between the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers was originally known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta. The aboriginal name survives in a local park, the Wallumatta Nature Reserve, located at the corner of Twin and Cressy Roads, North Ryde. =European settlement= In 1792 Governor Phillip began the granting of parcels of lands to Royal Marines, and the area was referred to on Phillip's maps as the Field of Mars, named after the Roman Field of Mars probably because of the military link. The area was later part of the suburb of North Ryde, and many consider that Marsfield is still a part of the greater North Ryde area. Field of Mars was also the name for the parish proclaimed in 1835. In 1874, following extensive debate including a Parliamentary Select Committee, the government resumed the Common for sale and settlement by small farmers, using the money to fund bridges across the Parramatta River at Gladesville and Iron Cove. The land was subdivided into small farms of between , and released for sale in stages, starting in 1885. Many of the streets in Marsfield and bordering suburbs, mainly Eastwood and Macquarie Park, are named after famous historical conflicts or battles, such as Abuklea Road, Agincourt Road, Alma Road, Balaclava Road, Bannockburn Road (West Pymble), Buffalo Road (Gladesville), Busaco Road, Corunna Road, Cressy Road (East Ryde), Crimea Road, Culloden Road, Fontenoy Road, Khartoum Road, Plassey Road, Talavera Road, Taranto Road, Torrington Road, Trafalgar Place, Vimiera Road, Waterloo Road. In 1894, the \\"Municipality of Marsfield\\" formed its own local government, splitting from Ryde Municipality. Stately, historical Curzon Hall was built in the 1890s by Harry Smith and named after his wife Isabella Curzon-Smith. The house was bought in 1921 by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul which established St Joseph's Seminary on the premises.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus and Robertson, 1990 It now serves as a function centre.

Origins The Black Sash was founded on 19 May 1955 by six middle-class women, Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton- Thompson. The organisation was founded as the Women‚Äôs Defence of the Constitution League but was eventually shortened by the press as the Black Sash due to the women's habit of wearing black sashes at their protest meetings. These black sashes symbolised the mourning for the South Africa Constitution. The founding members gathered for tea in Johannesburg before they decided to organise a movement against the Senate Act. They succeeded to hold a vigil of 2 000 women who marched from Joubert Park to the Johannesburg City Hall. The Black Sash initially campaigned against the removal of Coloured or mixed race voters from the voters' roll in the Cape Province by the National Party government. As the apartheid system began to reach into every aspect of South African life, Black Sash members demonstrated against the Pass Laws and the introduction of other apartheid legislation. It would later open Advice Offices to provide information concerning their legal rights to non- white South African's affected by that legislation. Its members \\"used the relative safety of their privileged racial classification to speak out against the erosion of human rights in the country. Their striking black sashes were worn as a mark of mourning and to protest against the succession of unjust laws. But they were not only on the streets. Volunteers spent many hours in the national network of advice offices and in the monitoring of courts and pass offices.\\" (Speech by Marcella Naidoo, National Director of the Black Sash, June 2005) Between 1955 and 1994, the Black Sash provided widespread and visible proof of white resistance towards the apartheid system. Its members worked as volunteer advocates to families affected by apartheid laws; held regular street demonstrations; spoke at political meetings; brought cases of injustice to the attention of their Members of Parliament, and kept vigils outside Parliament and government offices. Many members were vilified within their local white communities, and it was not unusual for women wearing the black sash to be physically attacked by supporters of apartheid. Sheena Duncan joined the Black Sash in 1963, and led it for many years, becoming life president. In her time many booklets were written, and translated into indigenous languages, to inform people of their legal rights under Apartheid. In the 1980s it formed a sub-committee called TRAC ( The Transvaal Rural Action Committee) which was later part of the National Land Committee assisting the non-white communities that were subject to forced land removals. It would also create and fund the Rural Women's Movement, supporting rural non-white women rights in regards to inheritance and land ownership, in 1986. TRAC employed Lydia Kompe to coordinate the RWM in 1986, and Nomhlangano Beauty Mkhize, from Driefontein, became its first chairperson. In 1983, the organisation called for the abolition of military conscription. The End Conscription Campaign was formed shortly afterwards. In 1994, Black Sash conducted voter education and produced a booklet called You and the Vote.

Its role was recognised by Nelson Mandela on his release and by subsequent political leaders. The organisation was reformed in 1995 as a non-racial humanitarian organisation, working to 'make human rights real for all living in South Africa'. In May 2015, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary as it shifted its focus towards education, training, advocacy and community monitoring. The celebration of the Black Sash history was also marked by the launching of two books, namely Standing on Street Corners: a History of the Natal Midlands Region of the Black Sash and a biography by Annemarie Hendrikz.

On July 25, 1943, Foster co- starred with Ellen Drew in \\"China Bridge,\\" a presentation of Silver Theater on CBS radio. Foster also enjoyed a secondary career as a vocalist. In 1948, he created a trio consisting of himself, his second wife Sheila, and guitarist Gene Leis. Leis arranged the songs, and the trio performed on radio and in clubs, appearing with Orrin Tucker, Peggy Ann Garner and Rita Hayworth. Television work In 1950, Foster began performing on the young but rapidly expanding medium of television. His first credited role on the \\"small screen\\" was in September of that year on the NBC anthology series Cameo Theatre, in an episode titled \\"The Westland Case\\". Later, after a few other appearances on series, he starred in the televised drama Waterfront, playing Captain John Herrick during the 1954-1955 broadcast season. He also guest-starred in 1963 in the ABC drama series Going My Way, starring Gene Kelly.

During times between his performances in films and on television, Foster often enjoyed boating and deep-sea fishing, especially for marlin, off California's southern coast. He continued to accept acting offers in his later years, although far less regularly during the final decade of his life. His last film credit was in the role of Nick Kassel in Chubasco, which was released just two years before his death. Chubasco, cast and crew listings and other production details, AFI.

In 1969, when the San Diego Padres made their debut as a Major League Baseball team, Foster wrote a song titled \\"Let's Go Padres\\", which was billed as the team's official song. He sang it at some home games that season. Foster died in 1970 at age 69 in La Jolla after what The New York Times described as \\"a long illness\\".

The son of a factory worker, he joined a Marxist circle as a schoolboy in Arensburg (now ) (which was renamed Kingissepp in 1952, but was restored to its original Estonian name in 1988), and organised the Estonian section of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, in St Petersburg. During the war with Germany, he was put in charge of a medical train on the Western Front. After the February revolution, he returned to Petrograd (as St Petersburg was now named), and joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Guards. After the Bolshevik Revolution, he was deputy chairman of the Estonian Revolutionary Soviet in Reval (now ), but fled back to Petrograd after Estonia was occupied by the German army. He joined the Cheka, and in August 1918 carried out the arrest of Fanny Kaplan, who had shot and attempted to kill Lenin. He returned to Estonia on November 1918 to organise the banned Estonian Communist Party, and presided over its first congress in November 1920. He was arrested by the Estonian Political Police on 3 May 1922, after a mass May Day demonstration in Tallinn, and executed that same night. Legacy The Soviet Russian government renamed the town of Yamburg to \\"Kingisepp\\" in his honour. An Estonian town Kuressaare on Saaremaa island was also renamed to \\"Kingissepp\\" to honour him.

The Green itself, which is roughly triangular, is bounded on two of its three sides by the New King's Road section of the King's Road, A308 road and Parsons Green Lane. The wider neighbourhood is bounded by the Harwood and Wandsworth Bridge Roads, A217 road to the East and Munster Road to the West, while the Fulham Road, A3219 road may be said to define its northern boundary. Its southern boundary is less clearly defined as it merges quickly and imperceptibly with the Peterborough estate and Hurlingham. At its historic centre lie two open spaces, the Green itself and Eel Brook Common. The name stems from the original village green, after the former residence of the rectors of Fulham Parish. It is one of the Conservation areas in Hammersmith and Fulham, that extends from the borough boundary in the east to Fulham High Street in the west.Hammersmith and Fulham Historic Buildings Group, Local List. Ed. Angela Dixon, Fourth Edition revised September 2004 History Timber rights attached to the Green are mentioned in court rolls dating from 1391. In 1625 there were only six rated residents for the area. By 1706, John Bowack opined in his Antiquities of Middlesex that it \\"was inhabited mostly by gentry and persons of quality\\". Two cricket matches were held on Parsons Green in 1731 and 1733. The first was on Tuesday, 10 August 1731 between Fulham and Chelsea, Fulham winning.Waghorn, p. 9. The second was on Tuesday, 26 June 1733 between the same two teams and played for a substantial prize of 30 guineas, although the result is unknown.Buckley, p. 8. In the 18th century, changes continued with the building of grand houses with grounds. These were bought by merchants and bankers from the City and not infrequently by members of the Court and their 'associations'. The area acquired a somewhat louche reputation at that time. Fulham F.C. had their ground in the park for two years from 1889. Early in the 20th century, a few test flights were carried out there with flying machines. Parsons Green is referred to in an early poem by Sir John Betjeman, The Varsity Students Rag, as a place where the poem's protagonist is said to have a \\"run-in\\" with a policeman. On 15 September 2017 an IED exploded on a London Underground train injuring 29 people. The IED was placed in a bucket however did not detonate fully, with injuries being largely burn related. No fatalities were reported. An 18-year-old Iraqi refugee was arrested the next day at the Port of Dover. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment, having found to have been in contact with members of Islamic State.

The Beaver flows through parts of Hamilton, Herkimer, and Lewis counties. Its source is Lake Lila in Long Lake. Owing to its high gradient as it drops out of the mountains, the Beaver is a favorite destination for whitewater kayakers and canoeists. In September of each year, hundreds of whitewater paddlers descend on the Beaver from all parts of the US and eastern Canada. Also because of its high gradient, there are several hydropower projects along the Beaver's course. These projects, created between 1905 and 1920 have fostered a series of highly productive fisheries in the reservoir chain. Popular among locals, the Soft Maple Reservoir is an excellent Smallmouth Bass fishery. The hamlet of Beaver River at the east end of Stillwater Reservoir, in the town of Webb has a year-round population of three that increases during the summer as many people have camps in this wilderness area. No roads lead to the hamlet; it is accessible only by hiking, rail car or boat in the summer and by snowmobile, snowshoes or cross country skis in the winter.  Fishing  The Beaver River is a true northern freshwater fishery, consisting of Northern Pike, Pickerel, Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Bullhead, Catfish, Muskellenge, Carp, and Sunfish.

Founded in the 1970s by Lloyd Barnes, as the Wackie's House Of Music based on White Plains Road in New York, the name Wackies also include a record shop and a studio. It is considered by some to be the first significant reggae studio and label in the United States.  Wackies Music =Wackies Sound= Wackies music has a distinctive sound. It is bass heavy and deliberately crafted to have what some people call a \\"lo-fi\\" sound. Wackies achieved this sound using special recording techniques and equipment. This equipment was so notable that some pieces now have a place in the Les Paul Museum. Popular Jamaican reggae artists such as Horace Andy, Sugar Minott, and Wayne Jarret appeared regularly on the label. However, Lloyd Barnes developed a number of New York-based artists such as: Itopia; Chosen Brothers; Love Joys; Jah Batta; Clive Field Marshall; Dub Generals, and Junior Delahaye, whose releases primarily appeared on the Wackies label. Most commonly known as \\"Bullwackie All Stars,\\" Lloyd Barnes worked with a notable group of studio musicians including: Jerry Harris; Ras Menelik; Jerry Johnson; Clive \\"Azul\\" Hunt, and Douglas Levy. = Influence on Hip Hop = Wackies music, while mainly known for its contribution to reggae, influenced the burgeoning hip hop movement of late 1970s and early 1980s New York. Reggae sound system dances were quite popular throughout New York City. Wackies music was played on specialized, powerful soundsystems while reggae deejays such as Jah Batta vocalized rhythmically and melodically atop the trademark bass-heavy sound. This influenced and encouraged the development of the hip hop parties featuring live MC's, the counterpart to the reggae soundsystem deejay. In 1979, Wackies also released one of the earliest hip hop records, \\"Wack Rap\\" by Solid C, Bobby D, and Kool Drop, credited as the Wackies Disco Rock Band =1990s and Wackies Far East Chapter= Wackies continued to record and release music through the 1990s, and in 1999 collaborated with Ras Takashi to form the Wackies Far East Chapter in Japan.

Wackies Far East Chapter, under the guidance of Ras Takashi, continues to be a force for Wackies release and distribution in Japan. =2000s= Wackies music continues to be released in the 2000s. Jammyland, Plush label, Ras Takashi, Dubsensemania and many others continue to collaborate with Lloyd Barnes. Concurrently, re-issues of 1970s and 1980s Wackies music have attained remarkable popularity and remain a constant force on the vintage scene.  Re-issue  Most if not all of the original (1970s and 1980s) Wackies recorded releases are out-of-print and in demand among reggae music collectors. Germans Moritz Von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, passionate devotees of the label's sound, have undertaken an extensive and ongoing 12\\" and LP re-issue campaign for the label through an exclusive imprint in the Basic Channel record label family, bearing the Wackies logo and label design. To date, the imprint has put out work from artists such as Horace Andy, Jerry Harris, Wayne Jarrett, Love Joys, The Meditations, and Sugar Minott, as well as several strictly dub releases by Wackies-sponsored bands.

Definition  Section 4 of the Constitution of Barbados defines citizens of Barbados as \\"Every person born in Barbados after the 29th November 1966.\\" The only exceptions are persons born on Barbadian soil whose parents possess diplomatic immunity and are not Barbadian citizens as well as children of enemy occupiers of Barbadian soil, or if neither parent is a citizen of Barbados (except in certain situations of statelessness for the child if the mother is a Barbadian citizen, or a UK/Colonies citizen if the birth was prior to 30 November 1966, or if the mother cannot be determined), or persons born aboard foreign-registered vessels located in Barbados. The constitution also allows for acquisition of citizenship by descent, registration, naturalization, and acts of parliament. Section 5 of the constitution states that children born outside of Barbados to most men who are citizens of Barbados are Barbadian citizens. It has additionally come to include children born to Barbadians serving as diplomats abroad, and those born overseas as children of fathers who were or would have been citizens of Barbados but for their death. Section 6 of the Constitution allows for the wife of a Barbadian man to be registered as a Barbadian citizen. According to the constitution, any requirements (such as residency or duration of marriage) are to be \\"prescribed,\\"The Constitution of Barbados and the woman must take an oath of allegiance if she is not a citizen of Ireland or a Commonwealth nation. The Constitution as written did not foresee Barbadian women marrying non-citizen men. Other current Commonwealth or Irish citizens who fulfill certain requirements such as having ordinary and lawful residence for seven years, which must have been completed before 30 November 1966, per the constitution's Chapter II, section 3.2.), may also apply for registration and be registered as Barbadian citizens, as determined at the Government Minister's discretion. Non-Commonwealth citizens may apply to the Minister for naturalization if they fulfill certain requirements, such as residing in Barbados for 5 of the 7 years prior to the application and all 12 .onths prior to the application (or any 12 continuous months within 6 months of the application, contingent upon the Minister's approval) and intends to reside in Barbados thereafter and swears allegiance to the Queen of Barbados. Section 9 of the constitution allows parliament to make \\"provision\\" for the acquisition of citizenship.  Rights  Citizens of Barbados enjoy the following rights: *Citizens at least 18 years of age have the right to vote and the right to contest in elections. Voting is optional. *Citizens have the right to join any trade union or political party. *The constitution states that persons may not be persecuted for their religion. All religions are free to practise as part of freedom of worship. *Citizens have the right to hold a Barbadian passport and to receive assistance by Barbadian consulates, embassies, and high commissions all around the world. *Citizens may move about the island freely without seeking permission from any authority. . Barbadians enjoy certain privileges as citizens of a member state of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). As with many of the other countries of CARICOM, the Barbadian passport bears the emblem of CARICOM.  Barbados and British nationality  Prior to 1966, persons connected with Barbados held British nationality. Barbadians were mainly classified as Citizens of the UK and Colonies (CUKCs). When Barbados achieving independence from the United Kingdom, it became a member of the Commonwealth, with HM Queen Elizabeth II remaining the head of state, in her new capacity as Queen of Barbados. The constitution's savings clause also allowed all existing law of the United Kingdom to remain in force in Barbados until it was changed by the Barbados Parliament. As such, Barbados would have thereby inherited the Statute of Westminster as part of its local law from the United Kingdom. Persons connected with Barbados at independence may have retained citizenship of the UK and Colonies if: * they did not acquire Barbados citizenship; or * they had specified ties to the UK itself or a place that remained a colony. Such persons would have become British citizens on 1 January 1983 if they had acquired a right of abode in the United Kingdom before that date. Otherwise, they would be British Overseas citizens. Acts by the British Government, which previously governed nationality laws, in Barbados include the following: *History of British nationality law **The Aliens Act, 1905 **The Aliens Restriction Act, 1914 **The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 **The Aliens Order, 1920 **The British Nationality Act, 1948, which established nationality called Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) **The Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962  Dual citizenship  Barbadian law allows their citizens to hold dual citizenship and encourages Barbadians living abroad to remain open to the benefits of holding such status.Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados: Dual citizenship  See also  *Barbados National Pledge *British nationality law *Citizenship *Nationality law ReferencesExternal links *Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados * Government of Barbados, Constitution, Chapter 2 *Barbados Law: CHAPTER 190 IMMIGRATION (1979 version), UNHCR *On acquiring citizenship, Barbados Advocate, 14 January 2010 Category:Nationality law Nationality Nationality law ","title":"Barbadian nationality law"},{"id":"2279129","text":"Disco Mix Club is primarily a remix label under (British Phonographic Industry) licence, which is not intended for the mass market but rather exclusively for professional DJs and enthusiasts.

Analytes may include endogenous molecules (e.g. neurotransmitter, hormones, glucose, etc.) to assess their biochemical functions in the body, or exogenous compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to determine their distribution within the body. The microdialysis technique requires the insertion of a small microdialysis catheter (also referred to as microdialysis probe) into the tissue of interest. The microdialysis probe is designed to mimic a blood capillary and consists of a shaft with a semipermeable hollow fiber membrane at its tip, which is connected to inlet and outlet tubing. The probe is continuously perfused with an aqueous solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding tissue fluid at a low flow rate of approximately 0.1-5ŒºL/min. Once inserted into the tissue or (body)fluid of interest, small solutes can cross the semipermeable membrane by passive diffusion. The direction of the analyte flow is determined by the respective concentration gradient and allows the usage of microdialysis probes as sampling as well as delivery tools. The solution leaving the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for analysis.  History  The microdialysis principle was first employed in the early 1960s, when push-pull canulas and dialysis sacs were implanted into animal tissues, especially into rodent brains, to directly study the tissues' biochemistry. While these techniques had a number of experimental drawbacks, such as the number of samples per animal or no/limited time resolution, the invention of continuously perfused dialytrodes in 1972 helped to overcome some of these limitations. Further improvement of the dialytrode concept resulted in the invention of the \\"hollow fiber\\", a tubular semipermeable membrane with a diameter of ~200-300Œºm, in 1974. Today's most prevalent shape, the needle probe, consists of a shaft with a hollow fiber at its tip and can be inserted by means of a guide cannula into the brain and other tissues.  Microdialysis probes  Schematic illustration of a microdialysis probe There are a variety of probes with different membrane and shaft length combinations available. The molecular weight cutoff of commercially available microdialysis probes covers a wide range of approximately 6-100kD, but also 1MD is available. While water- soluble compounds generally diffuse freely across the microdialysis membrane, the situation is not as clear for highly lipophilic analytes, where both successful (e.g. corticosteroids) and unsuccessful microdialysis experiments (e.g. estradiol, fusidic acid) have been reported. However, the recovery of water-soluble compounds usually decreases rapidly if the molecular weight of the analyte exceeds 25% of the membrane‚Äôs molecular weight cutoff.  Recovery and calibration methods  Due to the constant perfusion of the microdialysis probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant sampling site. In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant sampling site, a calibration factor (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using the constant rate of analyte exchange across the microdialysis membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte‚Äôs extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency is defined as the ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (Cin‚àíCout) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant sampling site (Cin‚àíCsample). In theory, the extraction efficiency of a microdialysis probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. Microdialysis probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. The proper selection of an appropriate calibration method is critically important for the success of a microdialysis experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans. Its actual value therefore needs to be determined in every in vivo experiment. = Low-flow-rate method = The low-flow-rate method is based on the fact that the extraction efficiency is dependent on the flow-rate. At high flow-rates, the amount of drug diffusing from the sampling site into the dialysate per unit time is smaller (low extraction efficiency) than at lower flow-rates (high extraction efficiency). At a flow-rate of zero, a total equilibrium between these two sites is established (Cout = Csample). This concept is applied for the (low-)flow-rate method, where the probe is perfused with blank perfusate at different flow-rates. Concentration at the sampling site can be determined by plotting the extraction ratios against the corresponding flow- rates and extrapolating to zero-flow. The low-flow-rate method is limited by the fact that calibration times may be rather long before a sufficient sample volume has been collected. = No-net-flux-method = During calibration with the no-net-flux-method, the microdialysis probe is perfused with at least four different concentrations of the analyte of interest (Cin) and steady-state concentrations of the analyte leaving the probe are measured in the dialysate (Cout). The recovery for this method can be determined by plotting Cout‚àíCin over Cin and computing the slope of the regression line. If analyte concentrations in the perfusate are equal to concentrations at the sampling site, no-net flux occurs. Respective concentrations at the no-net-flux point are represented by the x-intercept of the regression line. The strength of this method is that, at steady-state, no assumptions about the behaviour of the compound in the vicinity of the probe have to be made, since equilibrium exists at a specific time and place. However, under transient conditions (e.g. after drug challenge), the probe recovery may be altered resulting in biased estimates of the concentrations at the sampling site. To overcome this limitation, several approaches have been developed that are also applicable under non-steady-state conditions. One of these approaches is the dynamic no- net-flux method. = Dynamic no-net-flux method = While a single subject/animal is perfused with multiple concentrations during the no-net-flux method, multiple subjects are perfused with a single concentration during the dynamic no-net-flux (DNNF) method. Data from the different subjects/animals is then combined at each time point for regression analysis allowing determination of the recovery over time. The design of the DNNF calibration method has proven very useful for studies that evaluate the response of endogenous compounds, such as neurotransmitters, to drug challenge. = Retrodialysis = During retrodialysis, the microdialysis probe is perfused with an analyte-containing solution and the disappearance of drug from the probe is monitored. The recovery for this method can be computed as the ratio of drug lost during passage (Cin‚àíCout) and drug entering the microdialysis probe (Cin). In principle, retrodialysis can be performed using either the analyte itself (retrodialysis by drug) or a reference compound (retrodialysis by calibrator) that closely resembles both the physiochemical and the biological properties of the analyte. Despite the fact that retrodialysis by drug cannot be used for endogenous compounds as it requires absence of analyte from the sampling site, this calibration method is most commonly used for exogenous compounds in clinical settings.  Applications  The microdialysis technique has undergone much development since its first use in 1972, when it was first employed to monitor concentrations of endogenous biomolecules in the brain. Today's area of application has expanded to monitoring free concentrations of endogenous as well as exogenous compounds in virtually any tissue. Although microdialysis is still primarily used in preclinical animal studies (e.g. laboratory rodents, dogs, sheep, pigs), it is now increasingly employed in humans to monitor free, unbound drug tissue concentrations as well as interstitial concentrations of regulatory cytokines and metabolites in response to homeostatic perturbations such as feeding and/or exercise. When employed in brain research, microdialysis is commonly used to measure neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA) and their metabolites, as well as small neuromodulators (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, NO), amino acids (e.g. glycine, cysteine, tyrosine), and energy substrates (e.g. glucose, lactate, pyruvate). Exogenous drugs to be analyzed by microdialysis include new antidepressants, antipsychotics, as well as antibiotics and many other drugs that have their pharmacological effect site in the brain. The first non-metabolite to be analyzed by microdialysis in vivo in the human brain was rifampicin. Applications in other organs include the skin (assessment of bioavailability and bioequivalence of topically applied dermatological drug products), and monitoring of glucose concentrations in patients with diabetes (intravascular or subcutaneous probe placement). The latter may even be incorporated into an artificial pancreas system for automated insulin administration. Microdialysis has also found increasing application in environmental research, sampling a diversity of compounds from waste-water and soil solution, including saccharides, metal ions, organic acids, and low molecular weight nitrogen. Given the destructive nature of conventional soil sampling methods, microdialysis has potential to estimate fluxes of soil ions that better reflect an undisturbed soil environment.  Critical analysis = Advantages = # To date, microdialysis is the only in vivo sampling technique that can continuously monitor drug or metabolite concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Depending on the exact application, analyte concentrations can be monitored over several hours, days, or even weeks. Free, unbound extracellular tissue concentrations are in many cases of particular interest as they resemble pharmacologically active concentrations at or close to the site of action. Combination of microdialysis with modern imaging techniques, such positron emission tomography, further allow for determination of intracellular concentrations. # Insertion of the probe in a precise location of the selected tissue further allows for evaluation of extracellular concentration gradients due to transporter activity or other factors, such as perfusion differences. It has, therefore, been suggested as the most appropriate technique to be used for tissue distribution studies. # Exchange of analyte across the semipermeable membrane and constant replacement of the sampling fluid with fresh perfusate prevents drainage of fluid from the sampling site, which allows sampling without fluid loss. Microdialysis can consequently be used without disturbing the tissue conditions by local fluid loss or pressure artifacts, which can occur when using other techniques, such as microinjection or push-pull perfusion. # The semipermeable membrane prevents cells, cellular debris, and proteins from entering into the dialysate. Due to the lack of protein in the dialysate, a sample clean-up prior to analysis is not needed and enzymatic degradation is not a concern. = Limitations = # Despite scientific advances in making microdialysis probes smaller and more efficient, the invasive nature of this technique still poses some practical and ethical limitations. For example, it has been shown that implantation of a microdialysis probe can alter tissue morphology resulting in disturbed microcirculation, rate of metabolism or integrity of physiological barriers, such as the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. While acute reactions to probe insertion, such as implantation traumas, require sufficient recovery time, additional factors, such as necrosis, inflammatory responses, or wound healing processes have to be taken into consideration for long-term sampling as they may influence the experimental outcome. From a practical perspective, it has been suggested to perform microdialysis experiments within an optimal time window, usually 24‚Äì48 hours after probe insertion. # Microdialysis has a relatively low temporal and spatial resolution compared to, for example, electrochemical biosensors. While the temporal resolution is determined by the length of the sampling intervals (usually a few minutes), the spatial resolution is determined by the dimensions of the probe. The probe size can vary between different areas of application and covers a range of a few millimeters (intracerebral application) up to a few centimeters (subcutaneous application) in length and a few hundred micrometers in diameter. # Application of the microdialysis technique is often limited by the determination of the probe‚Äôs recovery, especially for in vivo experiments. Determination of the recovery may be time-consuming and may require additional subjects or pilot experiments. The recovery is largely dependent on the flow rate: the lower the flow rate, the higher the recovery. However, in practice the flow rate cannot be decreased too much since either the sample volume obtained for analysis will be insufficient or the temporal resolution of the experiment will be lost. It is therefore important to optimize the relationship between flow rate and the sensitivity of the analytical assay. The situation may be more complex for lipophilic compounds as they can stick to the tubing or other probe components, resulting in a low or no analyte recovery.

The Englishman's flora, Hart-Davis, 1975, p.176 The similar word ' was used in the Welsh language. Like other varieties of Prunus domestica, the bullace may have had its origin in hybrids between the sloe (Prunus spinosa) and cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera), though there is also evidence that domestica was solely descended from the latter.Rose-related fruits, Natural History Museum Another theory suggests that the bullace developed (or was selected) over time from the sloe, without the involvement of Prunus cerasifera.Woldring, H. \\"On the origin of plums: a study of sloe, damson, cherry plums, domestic plums and their intermediate forms\\", in Palaeohistoria, 39,40 (1997-1998): Institute of Archaeology, Groningen, 535 Prunus insititia is still, however, occasionally regarded as a separate (entirely native) species. It is possible that the bullace is genuinely native to Great Britain: the horticulturalist Harold Taylor, in his book The Plums of England, described it as \\"the only truly English plum\\", observing that all other hybrid varieties of plum and damson had at least some non-native origins.Taylor, 1949, p.2 Although once cultivated, and familiar to gardeners of the Tudor period, the bullace gradually fell out of favour as newer, larger or sweeter types of damson or plum displaced it, and it hung on at the fringes of cultivation. Its hardiness meant that, like the damson, it was occasionally planted as a windbreak or hedging tree, and until the 20th century was regarded as valuable for providing fruit very late in the year. Varieties Four main varieties of bullace are recognised in England: the White, Black, Shepherd's and Langley. The bullace may be found as a small tree, growing to around 8 metres in height, or as a bush, distinguishable from the sloe by its broader leaves and small number or complete absence of spines. There is, however, a wide variation between trees in different districts due to hybridization and local selection. Bullaces generally ripen in October‚ÄìNovember, rather later than other types of plum, and fruit heavily. They may sometimes be found growing wild in woods or hedgerows, particularly near old farmhouses; others may be found in old gardens or orchards, or can still be purchased from some nurseries. =Black Bullace= The Black Bullace is the common \\"wild\\" bullace of woods in England, recognisable by its small, round black or dark purple fruit.Bagenal, N. B. Fruit growing: modern cultural methods, Ward, Lock, 1939, p.186 It is sometimes classified as insititia var. nigra.Sell, P. \\"The cherries and plums of Cambridgeshire\\", Nature in Cambridgeshire, 33 (1991), 31 It can be quite astringent until very ripe, or subject to a slight frost; a larger variety known as the \\"New Black Bullace\\" was later developed from it. =White Bullace= Fruit of the White or Golden Bullace, showing the slight blush often found on the sunward side The White Bullace, sometimes classified as insititia var. syriaca, has small, yellowish fruit, with greenish flesh.Lindley, G. A guide to the orchard and fruit garden, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown & Green, 1831, p.467 A very old variety, it was once known in Cambridgeshire and Essex by the name \\"cricksies\\" or \\"crickses\\", formed on an earlier plural \\"creeks\\", and probably originating in Anglo-Norman '.Notes and Queries, 1851, p.451, and 1898, p.117 It was grown in large quantities in Norfolk in the 19th century, for use in preserving or cooking; Hogg described the flesh as \\"firm, juicy, sweet and subacid\\".Hogg, p.257 It is also occasionally referred to as the \\"Golden Bullace\\". =Shepherd's Bullace= This variety has relatively large round fruit, ripening by October to a grass green or yellowish green colour, with small red spots on the sunward side.Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society, 1920, p.623 It was formerly common in Kent and Essex and may still be found in hedgerows in eastern England. =Langley Bullace= The Langley Bullace, or \\"Veitch's Black Bullace\\", is by far the newest variety, being first raised in 1902 by the Veitch nurseries at Langley, Berkshire. It was a cross between an Orleans plum and the Farleigh damson, and is therefore not considered a true bullace in some sources.Bagenal, p.188 This is the largest variety, and when ripe - which occurs in November - is much the sweetest. =Other varieties= Other names have appeared, but are likely to represent either the above broad types or variations of them; Abercrombie and Mawe, writing in 1779, described three types of bullace, the \\"white\\", \\"black\\" and \\"red\\".Abercrombie, J. and Mawe, T. The British fruit-gardener, and art of pruning, 1779, p.99 Loudon also mentions a black, white and red bullace, as well a double flowered variety flore pleno.London, J. C. Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, 1844, p. li Hogg described an \\"Essex Bullace\\", which appears in all respects identical to the Shepherd's Bullace, and a \\"Royal Bullace\\", said to bear very large, yellow-green fruit. A \\"New Large Bullace\\", probably synonymous with the Royal Bullace, was occasionally mentioned, described as very similar to the Shepherd's Bullace but with larger leaves, many of which were glandless, a much more vigorous habit, and lighter cropping.Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society, 1906, 623 Uses Bullaces are often stated to only be suitable for cooking.RHS Complete Gardener's Manual, Dorling Kindersley, 2011, p.266 As well as being used for stewing and making various fruit preserves, they were also traditionally used to make fruit wine, and a bullace pie was stated to be one of the usual centrepieces of a 19th-century harvest home supper in the south of England.British Cyclop√¶dia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography, Wm. S. Orr, 1838, p. 643 However, some bullaces are palatable raw when sufficiently ripe.

It broadcast to the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire on 1161 AM and DAB radio. It played classic pop and rock music from the 1970s to the 1990s.  History  The station was formed on 31 October 1988 when Viking Radio split its 1161 (originally said \\"Double-One-Six-One\\") medium wave frequency from its FM service. It has had many name changes, initially being \\"Viking Gold\\", followed by \\"Classic Gold\\" (not to be confused with the service operated by UBC), \\"Classic Gold Radio\\", \\"Great Yorkshire Gold\\" and \\"Great Yorkshire Radio\\". Most of these formats, with the exception of \\"Viking Gold\\", shared programmes with the AM stations of the \\"Yorkshire Radio Network\\". At the start of 1997, new owners Emap decided to scrap the regional Classic Gold station and replaced it with local stations under the brandname of Magic, with a new format of Hot Adult Contemporary music. Magic 1161 launched on 12 February 1997. In December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes and in line with the other Magic AM stations began networking between 10am-2pm, and 7pm-6am. During these hours it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour. In January 2003, after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, Magic 105.4, and a regional northern network was created with Magic 1152 at the hub at the weekend and the Newcastle station of the same name during the week. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as a local news summary on the hour. From July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network, leaving weekday breakfast as the only locally produced show. The local show was replaced with a regional breakfast programme from Leeds, which ran from March 2013 to December 2014.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2013/04/bauer-networks-three-more-magic-stations/ On 5 January 2015, Magic 1161 was rebranded as Viking 2 as part of a revamp of the Bauer network and the station is now entirely networked with the other Bauer AM stations in the North although local news, weather and travel continue to be broadcast as opt-outs during the day. On 7 January 2019, Viking 2 rebranded as Greatest Hits East Yorkshire & North Lincolnshire.Bauer Media to launch Greatest Hits Radio network Radio Today, 15 November 2018 Closure On 31 August 2020 the station was replaced by a relay of Magic UK.

Professional boxing career According to records, Villaflor began his career as a professional boxer when he was only thirteen years old, on October 1, 1966, beating Flash Javier by decision in four rounds. Most of Villaflor's early bouts' records were not well kept, therefore, although October 1, 1966 appears to have been the date of Villaflor's professional debut, this is not known with certainty, and neither is the location where the fight took place. Villaflor ran a record of twelve wins without a loss, with eight knockouts before he suffered his first loss, against Roger Boy Pedrano, by an eight-round decision in a fight apparently held on July 1, 1967, at the Philippines. After winning his next fight, he faced Pedrano and again lost by decision, in another fight without much documented data. Villaflor had his first documented fight on February 1, 1968, at Manila. Villaflor and Rod Sario had a technical draw (tie) after four rounds. Villaflor would have a total of seven draws in his professional boxing career, a relatively large number in that category. Although Villaflor won nine, lost two and drew two of his next thirteen bouts, his fighting in the Philippines exclusively represented a problem for him to become known overseas. He began the 1970s by losing two ten-round decisions in a row, to Pedro Martinez on March 7, 1970 and to Alfredo Avila, six weeks later. Villaflor won his next seventeen bouts, however, eleven of them by knockout. He moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, so he could get more exposure in the United States and the rest of the world. Villaflor liked Honolulu so much that he still lives in the Hawaiian city. He beat Rafael L√≥pez by a first-round knockout, on April 13, 1971, in what represented both his first fight in Honolulu and also his first fight abroad. He also beat former world champion Raul Cruz, beaten by knockout in ten rounds, November 11, 1971. On April 25, 1972, Villaflor was given his first opportunity at a world title, when faced with WBA and Lineal Jr. Lightweight champion Alfredo Marcano of Venezuela. Villaflor became world champion by defeating Marcano by a fifteen-round unanimous decision at Honolulu. Villaflor then engaged in a series of non-title bouts, including one against Roberto Dur√°n world title challenger Jimmy Robertson, beaten by Villaflor by a ten-round decision on November 15 of that year. Prior to that, he had retained the title with a fifteen-round draw against Victor Echegaray, on September 25. On March 12, 1973, Villaflor lost his title for the first time, being beaten on points by Japan's Kuniaki Shibata over fifteen rounds in Honolulu. But, after two knockout wins, Villaflor had a rematch with Shibata, also in Honolulu, and he recovered the WBA world Jr. Lightweight championship with a first-round knockout, on October 17, also at Honolulu. Next for Villaflor was a widely expected fight across Asia, as he met Japan's top rated challenger, Apollo Yoshio, on March 14, 1974, at Toyama. The two boxers fought to a fifteen-round draw. After another non-title win, Villaflor met future world champion Yasutsune Uehara, on August 24 in Honolulu, knocking out Uehara in the second round. After that, Villaflor made his mainland United States debut, when he and perennial challenger Ray Lunny III fought to a six-round technical draw on November 14, a cut on Villaflor's head which had been caused by a headbutt being the determining factor for the fight to end with such result. Villaflor retained the title twice more, then met Samuel Serrano for the first time, on April 13, 1976, in Honolulu, and the two combatants fought to a fifteen-round draw. The draw was so controversial that the WBA ordered an immediate rematch. After winning a non-title bout by knockout, Villaflor traveled to Puerto Rico for the rematch, held on November 16, at Hiram Bithorn stadium, in San Juan. Serrano outpointed Villaflor over fifteen rounds in what turned out to be Villaflor's last professional bout. He is currently involved in managing other boxers' careers. Villaflor is the Sergeant At Arms for the Hawaii State Senate, a position to which he is appointed by a vote of the Senate each year. In that capacity he was a co-defendant in a lawsuit stemming from his unlawful arrest and alleged assault on Mitch Kahle, a protester against the Legislature's violation of the First Amendment doctrine of the Separation of Church and State. Kahle was acquitted of all charges against him on April 29, 2010, and is currently pursuing legal action against everyone involved in his arrest, both in their official capacities and as private persons. Professional boxing record Villaflor had a record of 54 recorded wins, with 6 losses and 7 draws, 31 of his wins being by knockout.

In: Der Spiegel, no. 38, 2000, 18 September 2000, p 134. and has been classified as a \\"right-wing extremist\\" group by the Thuringian Landesbeh√∂rde f√ºr Verfassungsschutz.Verfassungsschutzbericht des Freistaats Th√ºringen - 1999 (PDF ) Punkt 4.6 The band was founded in Sondershausen by Hendrik M√∂bus (also known as Randall Flagg / Jarl Flagg Nidh√∂gg / JFN) and Sebastian Schauseil in 1992, with a third member, Andreas Kirchner, joining at a later stage. Their lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik M√∂bus is the founder of the Deutsche Heidnische Front), pro-heathen revivalist Germanic, and anti-Judeo-Christian themes. The band achieved infamy because its original members (now no longer in the band since 1999) murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band.Michael Moynihan, Didrik S√∏derlind: Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground. Feral House 1998, p. 256ff. On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members M√∂bus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner, in a now infamous quotation, was reported as saying: \\"Oh shit‚Äînow I‚Äôve completely ruined my life.\\"Michael Moynihan, Didrik S√∏derlind: Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground. Feral House 1998, p. 246.

Feral House 1998, p. 247ff.  Hendrik M√∂bus  In prison, M√∂bus (born 20 January 1976) was able to carry on with the band under the temporary name \\"In Ketten\\" (German for \\"In Chains\\"). After the murder in Sondershausen, Absurd became a cult band within Neo-Nazi groups. A live album was recorded in prison and had since been released on vinyl. The tape Thuringian Pagan Madness shows on its cover the grave of the murdered Sandro Beyer, and inside says: \\"The cover shows the grave of Sandro B. murdered by horde ABSURD on 29.04.93 AB\\".Absurd: Thuringian Pagan Madness, Capricornus Prod. 1995. The band members were released on parole in 1998, because they had been under eighteen when they had committed their crime. Shortly after release, M√∂bus violated the terms of his parole when at a concert he performed the Hitler salute, which is illegal in Germany. Hendrik and his brother Ronald \\"Wolf\\" M√∂bus also posed together in a series of photographs at Auschwitz death camp, holding up nazi banners inside a gas chamber and outside barracks. His parole was consequently revoked. He managed to flee to the United States, where he met William Luther Pierce, but was captured there. During his stay in America he also got in a conflict about money with some of his contacts who he stayed with for some time, one of them being the then neo-Nazi pagan occultist Nathan Pett, who later left the far right scene, and was apparently beaten with a hammer and threatened with a pistol by two persons. At first this was just a rumour but M√∂bus later admitted in an interview for a neo-nazi site that the incident had taken place. He was arrested by U.S. marshals. In 2001, after his request for asylum was denied, he was sent back to prison for the remaining three years for murder. For mocking his victim and for the Hitler salute he was sentenced to a further twenty-six months. On 15 May 2003 he was again sentenced to four years in prison. M√∂bus is today free and runs his own music label, called Darker Than Black Records (founded in 1994), which distributes NSBM albums and merchandise on an organized scale since 2007. Antifascist Action in Germany has organized at least one demonstration in late 2014 to protest against the racist music shop M√∂bus owns together with one other person. Two cars belonging to M√∂bus were damaged in an arson which the Antifascist Action Germany claimed responsibility for, during a campaign in Berlin where there was also posters with M√∂bus face and personal information on put up, and graffiti with messages against him and the label. When released from the last prison sentence M√∂bus appeared on stage during a neonazi live gig, but did not play anything. Schauseil is still involved with the underground metal scene; he performed between 1999 and 2004 with the folk-influenced nationalist band Halgadom, the black metal project Wolfsmond (also featuring bassplayer Unhold, who currently plays drums in Absurd), and the neofolk band In Acht und Bann. He has distanced himself from National Socialism and politics in general, as evidenced by the current direction of Wolfsmond and as stated in an interview he conducted with Vampire Magazine. In 2002 Pantheon (USA) released a tribute album to M√∂bus, called Jarl die Freiheit ('Jarl of Freedom'). In 2019, Hendrik M√∂bus was at a Black Metal gig in Denmark, and was seen handing out flyers promoting a nazi event. This led to him being confronted by parts of the audience, and also asked by the organizers to put down the propaganda. A fight erupted and M√∂bus was beaten by a group of unidentified people from the audience who left the gig afterwards but returned and threw pepperspray at M√∂bus, which interrupted the show for a while.  Band history since 1999  The band Absurd has continued in existence since 1999, going through many changes of personnel, and losing all of its original members. The leader is Wolf, Hendrik's brother, with Sebastian Schauseil performing the occasional clean vocal part on releases such as Asgardsrei (1999), Werwolfthron (2001), and Totenlieder (2002).  Music style  The demos and the first album Facta Loquuntur have strong Oi! and Rock Against Communism (RAC) influences.Michael Moynihan, Didrik S√∏derlind: Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground. Feral House 1998, p. 250ff. Their musical idols were bands like Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Manowar,\\"Mit den gr√∂√üten und nachhaltigsten Einflu√ü auf uns, sowohl musikalisch als auch lyrisch, haben nicht etwa skandinavische Black Metal-Bands ausge√ºbt. Neben Manowar und Danzig war es vielmehr eine deutsche Horrorpunk-Band, welche zum Zeitpunkt unserer Bandgr√ºndung bisher nur zwei Ver√∂ffentlichungen in den fr√ºhen 1980er-Jahren herausgebracht hatte.

Danzig and especially Der Fluch, a band covered by Absurd on both Der f√ºnfzehnj√§hrige Krieg and the split release Weltenfeind, whereas the Scandinavian bands were no significant musical or lyrical influence. On the other hand, the band called itself a black metal band from the very beginning; in an interview with the pupil magazine of his school, Hendrik M√∂bus said Absurd would play the hardest, rawest and most ingenious black metal in GermanyBillerbeck, Liane von; Nordhausen, Frank: Satanskinder. Der Mordfall von Sondershausen und die rechte Szene. 3. revised edition, Berlin 2001, p. 158. Michael Moynihan and Didrik S√∏derlind classified the band's early recordings \\"more akin to '60s garage punk than some of the [...] Black Metal of their contemporaries\\",Michael Moynihan, Didrik S√∏derlind: Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground. Feral House 1998, p. 260ff. and according to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, the second demo Death from the Forest had no similarities to black metal neither of the first nor the second wave, but was rather a mixture of primitive hard rock and punk rock elements. Due to its musical dilettantism, the band was not taken seriously by black metallers for a long time.Christian Dornbusch, Hans- Peter Killguss: Unheilige Allianzen. Black Metal zwischen Satanismus, Heidentum und Neonazismus, p. 52. In an ad in Sub Line magazine, the same demo was praised as \\"unholy, hard guitar rock, wild and boisterous; for all the dark souls out there\\" (\\"unheiliger, harter Gitarrenrock, wild und ungest√ºm; f√ºr all die schwarzen Seelen dort drau√üen\\").Sub Line, no. 3, march 1993, p. 53. The Mansion of Metal site classified it as \\"essentially crappy punk rock/RAC\\" and claims the Thuringian Pagan Madness demo to have black metal influences. Hendrik M√∂bus called the Asgardsrei EP the band's first holistic piece of work, adjusted in concept and layout as well, and the band's step away from its former musical dilettantism; however, he still described some of it as dilettante, and Ronald M√∂bus criticised the final mixing.

The second installment in the Tales for All (Contes Pour Tous) series of films by Les Productions La F√™te, the film stars Mathew Mackay, Siluck Saysanasy, Alison Darcy, and Michael Hogan. Plot Michael Baskin is an average 11-year-old boy. His father, Billy Baskin, is a struggling artist and temporary sole caregiver of the children while his wife attends to the needs of her recently deceased father in Australia. Upon hearing the news that an abandoned mansion has recently burned down, Michael and his friend Connie decide to explore the remains. Outside the mansion, Connie dares Michael to take a look inside, leading to a frightening encounter with the ghosts of its homeless inhabitants who had died in the fire. Michael does not know this yet, but his fearsome run in with the ghosts has given him a mysterious illness simply known as \\"The Fright\\". Michael wakes up the next morning to find out that \\"The Fright\\" has made him lose all of his hair. After a failed attempt with a wig (his wig was pulled off by an older boy during a fight in a soccer game), the ghosts visit Michael in his sleep and give him the recipe of a magical formula for hair growth, the main ingredient of which is peanut butter. Michael's first attempt to make the formula is thwarted when his father and sister think he is making something to ingest (rather than use topically) and dispose of it. The ghosts return the following night, giving themselves a second chance to pay him back for giving his money to some homeless people, and also give Michael special instruction not to add too much peanut butter, as it will end in dreadful results. Michael successfully makes the formula this time, but ignores their instructions not to overdo the peanut butter, and wakes up the next morning to find that his new hair has already begun to grow. After only a few minutes, Michael has grown a full head of hair. Suspicious of his fast growing follicles, Connie confronts Michael about his unusual ability. When Michael reveals to him his concoction, Connie decides to apply some to his pubic area, in an attempt to create the illusion that he's going through puberty. Connie soon discovers that the joke is on him. Pretty soon, Michael and Connie's hair grows to such lengths that it has become a nuisance for the school and their classmates, resulting in their suspensions. While Michael frantically searches for a solution, Connie discovers that the hair will stop growing by yelling at it. The art teacher at Michael's school, simply called the Signor, frightens children and forbids them from using their imagination. After getting fired from the school, the Signor finds out about Michael's condition and kidnaps him (and many other neighborhood children) to make magic paint brushes from Michael's ever-growing hair, in which he subdues Michael with a knockout drug. The kidnapped children are put to work under tough conditions. \\"We have to make 500 brushes a day, or we don't eat!\\" The paintbrushes are so powerful that they paint whatever their user imagines without need for detail or neatness. Connie, and Michael's sister, Suzie, discover the Signor's magical paintbrush factory and try to rescue Michael and the other kids. Connie tries to use force, but he is overpowered by Signor and his dog James. Instead, Connie tricks the Signor into painting a picture of the abandoned mansion. Connie then dares him to investigate inside, leading \\"The Fright\\" to be passed on from Michael to the Signor. The Signor, now bald, escapes from the haunted house and chases the children, locking them up. Just as Connie is about to escape with Michael, Susan and their dad find the factory and the Signor is arrested by the local police. The film ends with the family reunited as the mother has returned home, and Michael's hair has stopped growing out of control. CastProduction *The original working title of the film was Michael's Fright. *This film features the first English-language songs performed by C√©line Dion (Listen to the Magic Man and Michael's Song). The French-language version of the film features French-language versions of the same songs (Dans la main d'un magicien and La ballade de Michel). *Skippy peanut butter paid for prominent product placement in the film.

It lost its status as a Mechanised infantry regiment in 2010 in line with the rationalisation of resources. As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. History=Origin= The Regiment was formed as the D‚ÄôUrban Volunteer Guard, in May 1854. In 1859 the unit became the Durban Rifle Guard. In 1873 the unit became known as the Royal Durban Rifles. In 1889 the unit became known as the Natal Royal Rifles (Left half Battalion). In 1895 it became the Durban Light Infantry. =With the Union Defence Force= On the constitution of the Union Defence Force in 1912, the Unit became the Durban Light Infantry, renamed the 1st Infantry, (Durban Light Infantry). In consequence the Unit was permitted to add to its badge \\"Primus in Africa\\", the motto retained by the unit today in recognition of its foundation. =Seniority= In 1935, King George V conferred the title Royal on two Regiments being the Royal Durban Light Infantry and the Royal Natal Carbineers, as a recognition of their seniority and service. In 1961 with the formation of the Republic, the title \\"Royal\\" was considered incompatible and the Regiment reverted to being the Durban Light Infantry. Regimental Colours At the centre of the 'Regimental Colour' is the badge worn by the Regiment since 1961. It consists of the recognised Infantry Silver Bugle with tassels and a shield with two wildebeest and a crown. The wildebeest are symbolic of the Province, while the crown retained as a traditional device is reminiscent of the title \\"Royal\\" bestowed upon the Regiment by King George V in 1935. The words \\"Primus in Africa\\" are superimposed within a scroll. The crest is composed of a lion passant guardant on three mounds ‚Äì the centre mound being charged with a pyramid. The lion is symbolic of strength, courage and fortitude. The three mounds are symbolic of the battles fought in World War II ‚Äì Monte Stanco, Monte Peza and Monte Sole/Caprara. The pyramid is symbolic of the 1941‚Äì1943 Egyptian Campaign. The garland which surrounds the coloured badge comprises the Thistle of Scotland, the Tudor Rose of England and the Shamrock of Ireland ‚Äì symbols taken from the old colour ‚Äì and the other two flowers, the Protea, the National flower of South Africa, and the Strelitzia, the flower of Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal). =Previous Dress Insignia= SADF and UDF eras Durban Light Infantry insignia =Current Dress Insignia= SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia Active Service # South Africa, Anglo-Zulu War 1879 # South Africa, Anglo-Boer War 18991902 # Relief of Ladysmith 1900 # Natal, Bambatha Rebellion 1906 # South West Africa 19141915 # East Africa 19161918 # Rand Miners‚Äô Revolt 1922 # World War II ## Western Desert 19411943 (See 1st SA Infantry Division) ## Bardia ## Gazala ## Alamein Defence ## Alamein Box ## El Alamein ## Italy 19441945 ## Casino II ## Florence ## Gothic Line ## Monte Stanco ## Monte Pezza ## Sole/Caprara ## Po Valley # South West Africa ‚Äì Namibia 19761994, five tours. # Internally in South Africa in support of the SAPS (SA.

As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. History=Origins= The Natal Carbineers Regiment traces its roots to 1854 but it was formally raised on 15 January 1855 and gazetted on 13 March of that year. =With the Union Defence Force= In 1913, the Regiment‚Äôs two ‚Äòwings‚Äô became known as the First and Second Mounted Rifles (Natal Carbineers) and in 1934 they re-assumed the name 1st and 2nd Natal Carbineers. The following year, they became the Royal Natal Carbineers, a title which remained in use until the country became a republic in 1961. =Campaigns= Since its inception, the Natal Carbineers have participated in every campaign in KwaZulu-Natal. Their baptism of fire came during the Langalibalele Rebellion in 1873 where they suffered their first casualties in action in the Drakensberg. Subsequently, during the Anglo-Zulu War, the Carbineers suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879.http://www.rfdiv.mil.za/docs/NATAL%20CARBINEERS.pdf = List of campaign and battle honours = The Natal Carbineers Regimental Colour  South Africa, 1879  The Natal Carbineers participated in the invasion of Zululand in January 1879, and on 22 January, 23 members of the Regiment perished in the famous battle of Isandlwana. The unit was subsequently relegated to garrison duties at Landman‚Äôs Drift on the Mzinyathi, or Buffalo River.  South Africa, 1899‚Äì1902  In September 1899, the Natal Carbineers were mobilized for active service in the British campaign to subdue the Boer republics of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. The Regiment served until October 1900, when the Natal Volunteer Forces were demobilized. Some men continued their service in the Volunteer Composite Regiment until the end of the war in May 1902. * Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal: From 2 November 1899 until 28 February 1900, the bulk of the Natal Carbineers was besieged in Ladysmith, and played a prominent part in that famous engagement. The most prominent military action was the attack by Colonial Forces on the Boer artillery emplacement at Gun Hill on the night of 7‚Äì8 December 1899. The Regiment lost heavily from the diseases that ravaged the garrison. A solitary squadron of the Natal Carbineers, the Estcourt-Weenen Squadron, avoided the siege of Ladysmith, and instead participated in the relief operations of Sir Redvers Buller as part of Hubert Gough's Composite Regiment. This squadron‚Äôs most notable military action of this period was the disastrous battle of Colenso on 15 December 1899, when four men were killed. These were their most serious losses for any one action during the Anglo-Boer War.  Natal, 1906  The Natal Carbineers saw extensive service in the Natal (or Bambatha) Uprising of 1906. From February to July 1906, the Regiment participated in the numerous sweeps and drives through the mountainous terrain of Zululand, as the Natal Colonial forces sought to trap and destroy the elusive ‚Äòrebel‚Äô warriors. The Carbineers were present at the decisive battle at Mhome Gorge on 10 June, where the back of the uprising was broken.  South-West Africa, 1914‚Äì1915  The Natal Carbineers, then known as the 1st and 2nd Mounted Rifles, were mobilized on 23 August 1914. Both battalions saw service in German South-West Africa, while the 2nd Battalion was also involved in the suppression of the short-lived Afrikaner Rebellion of 1914. * Gibeon: The climactic battle of the South African campaign in German South-West Africa was fought at Gibeon Station on 25 April 1915. The Carbineers lost two men killed in the engagement. East Africa, 1940‚Äì1941 On 17 July 1940 the 1st (Royal) Natal Carbineers sailed for Kenya as part of the 1st South African Brigade. Their destination was the Italian colonial empire in East Africa. For the next 10 months the Regiment participated in the South African advance through Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), until Italian resistance was broken at Amba Alagi in May 1941. * El Wak: The first major engagement of the East African campaign for the Carbineers was fought on 16 December 1940 at the Italian border post of El Wak, on the northern Kenyan frontier with Italian Somaliland. The Regiment lost its first World War II casualty, Sergeant Athol Paton, in this otherwise successful clash. * The Juba: The Juba River was the Italian Army‚Äôs major defensive line in Somaliland. Several actions were fought during January and February 1941, at Gobwen and Giumbo, but the period is best remembered for the disastrous ambush on 22 February of a Carbineer patrol at Gelib. Twelve men lost their lives. * Kombolcha: The engagement at Kombolcha in Ethiopia on 22 April 1941 followed the occupation of the capital city, Addis Ababa in March. The fighting at Kombolcha was distinguished by a daring nocturnal route march to successfully outflank Italian mountain-top positions. The battle honour awards refer to the general period 17 to 25 April. * Amba Alagi: Italian resistance in East Africa was finally crushed when the mountain fortress of Amba Alagi, between Dessie and Asmara, was successfully stormed by British and Commonwealth forces that included the 1st Royal Natal Carbineers. The Italians surrendered on 17 May 1941, and this battle honour refers to the period from 11 to 19 April.Kleynhans E.P. ARMOURED WARFARE, THE SOUTH AFRICAN EXPERIENCE IN EAST AFRICA, 1940-1941 Faculty of Military Science, Stellenbosch University, 2014  Western Desert, 1941‚Äì1943  Following the fall of Italian East Africa in May 1941, the 1st South African Brigade was dispatched to North Africa to confront the joint Italian-German forces in the see-saw offensives across Egypt and Libya. The Carbineers earned numerous individual battle honours between June 1941 and January 1943 when it sailed home for a well-earned leave. * Sidi Rezegh: The 1st Royal Natal Carbineers played a small part in the disastrous battles in the vicinity of Sidi Rezegh in Libya during late November 1941, between the 19th and 23rd. These actions formed part of Operation Crusader, the British forces of November‚ÄìDecember 1941, intended to relieve the first siege of Tobruk. * Taieb el Essem: The Carbineers were a component of the 1st Brigade force that held a defensive box south of Sidi Rezegh. On 24‚Äì25 November 1941 this force repelled a heavy German armoured assault. * Bir Sciafsciuf: This minor engagement in November 1941 pitted a small Carbineer component against an enemy convoy in the vicinity of Sidi Rezegh. * Gazala: The Gazala Line, to the west of Tobruk, established in early 1942, was a series of connected strong-points intended to blunt a German thrust towards Egypt. Carbineers formed part of the garrison of this line from March to June 1942, when they were forced to retreat after a German breakthrough and the fall of Tobruk. The major highlight of the Gazala sojourn was the patrol on 5 June where Sergeant Quentin Smythe was awarded the Victoria Cross. * Point 204: This little-known clash occurred in the Alem Hamza area of the Gazala Line on 5 June 1942. The single company involved suffered heavy casualties in an engagement with Italian troops. Among the six killed was H.P. Masterton-Smith, the 1931 Comrades Marathon winner. * El Alamein defence: Following the breaching of the Gazala Line and the fall of Tobruk, British and Commonwealth forces retired to El Alamein, not far from Alexandria. Here a comprehensive series of defences were prepared. In July 1942 the Carbineers played its part in denying the Germans the breakthrough that they needed to attain victory in this theatre. * Qattara: On 26‚Äì27 July 1942 a detachment of the Carbineers was involved in this subsidiary action in the Alamein defensive battles of July 1942. * El Alamein (2nd battle): The Carbineers played a small but eventful part in the huge and decisive Second Battle of El Alamein in October‚ÄìNovember 1942. The Carbineer participation was confined mainly to the initial phase launched on 23 October.  Italy, 1944‚Äì1945  The 1st Royal Natal Carbineers landed at Taranto, Italy, on 20 April 1944, just in time for the latter phases of the battles for Cassino. From there the Regiment fought its way up the Italian boot, through Rome, until final victory in May 1945. *Cassino: The task of breaching the German Gustav Line, straddling southern Italy, was dominated by the mountain position of Cassino, under assault since January 1944. The Carbineers entered the fray in May, and it was on the night of the 9th‚Äì10th of that month that the Regiment‚Äôs first casualty in Italy, Corporal J.S.P. Airey, was killed. The Carbineers were active on the Cassino line for several weeks until 21 May. This battle honour refers to the general period of 11 to 18 May 1944. *Paliano: Two companies of the Carbineers were involved in this action along Route 6 during the advance from Cassino to Rome, as German forces fought several rearguard actions. *Bagno Regio: Bagno Regio was a hilltop village north of Rome, and on the night of 12 ‚Äì 13 June 1944, elements of the Carbineers scaled a precipitous rock face to effect its capture. *Citt√† della Pieve: This action occurred during the period 16 ‚Äì 19 June 1944 on the Allied advance north of Rome. Two companies of the Carbineers lost eight men killed. *Florence: Following the fall of Rome on 5 June 1944, German resistance stiffened in the vicinity of Florence, and during June there were several sharp actions, such as those at Bagno Regio and Chiusi. The battle honour covers the period from 17 July to 10 August. This activity was followed by a period of rest during August. *The Greve: The action at the Greve, a river north of Rome, was fought over the period 24 July to 2 August. *Gothic Line was another of the German defensive lines that straddled the boot of Italy as the Allied armies pushed northwards from Rome in mid-to late-1944. The Gothic Line Carbineer battles fought in the effort to breach it, and thereafter, have entered the Regiment‚Äôs hall-of-fame: Monte Vigese, Monte Stanco, Monte Pezza and others. *Monte Vigese: Monte Vigese was a seemingly impregnable rocky eminence occupied by entrenched German forces. On 6 October, however, in driving rain and poor visibility, ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company, under Major Peter Francis, performed the virtually impossible and drove the defenders off. *Monte Stanco: On 10 October, at Monte Stanco, the Carbineers suffered one of their few reverses of the Italian campaign, when they were compelled to abandon this hard-won feature. Captain Jacko Edmonds earned the American Silver Star for gallantry for his part in this action. *Monte Pezza: Monte Pezza was the next peak in the Gothic Line to be tackled by the 1st Royal Natal Carbineers, on 17 October. *Po Valley: Following a long and hard winter in the snow-bound Apennine Mountains, the campaign to drive the Germans out of the rest of Italy, the fighting entered the Po Valley, and the Carbineers once again played a significant part in operations from 19 to 30 April 1945.  South- West Africa/Angola, 1976‚Äì1989  The Natal Carbineers saw service in a counter-insurgency capacity in northern Namibia (South-West Africa) for three months from August 1976, and thereafter in numerous modular deployments over the next decade. =Present= The regiment has been active since 1994 in internal duties in support of the police as well as border protection. They have also contributed to external peace-keeping missions to inter alia MONUSCO in the DRC. =Name change= In August 2019, 52 Reserve Force units had their names changed to reflect the diversity of the SANDF. https://www.defenceweb.co.za/featured/new-reserve-force-unit-names/ Going forward this units name was changed to the Ingobamakhosi Carbineers.

The creation of the lake and its outlet is attributed to a post-glacial isostatic rebound, which resulted in uplift of the land. As is common in Finnish lakes, the water color of the lake is dark on account of the high proportion of bogs present in the catchment of the drainage basin that drains humic substances. Pielinen Lake is in the northernmost part of Karelia, which is the land of the Karelian peoples, a Northern European area of historical significance not only for Finland, but also for Russia and Sweden. Apart from the lake, several attractions on the shores of the lake are the Koli National Park known for its scenic beauty in summer and the winter sports of skiing, the whitewater rafting centre at Ruunaa Hiking Center, the active centres of Lieksa and Nurmes. Geography Location The lake is located at an elevation of in the North Karelia region in eastern Finland. It has a water spread area of and a shore length of , and is bound within geographical coordinates of 62¬∞54‚Äì63¬∞33N and 29¬∞07‚Äì30¬∞14E. The maximum length is and the width varies from . The lake's drainage area of is equally distributed between Finland and Russia. The maximum depth of water in the lake is with a reported mean depth of . The water courses that drain into the lake are the Haapajarvi-Valtimojarvi and Saramojoki from its north-west direction, Viekinjoki River and Lieksanjoki River from the north-east side, and flows from the small drainage basin of the Juvanjoki River into the west. The lake has many islands such the Paalasmaa (27.2 km2), Kynsisaari (), Porosaari (), Toinensaari (), Hattusaari (), Koveronsaari () and Retusaari (). The lake drains, unregulated, southward through the Pielis River into the larger Saimaa Lake of the large Vuoksi watercourse, which is used for timber floating. The variation in water level is limited to ; water transport on the lake is thus substantial. The catchment of the lake is densely forested, particularly on its rugged western shore, which is capped by Koli hill. At (), the point is the highest mountain in the catchment. The shores have a diverse landscape including barren lands, rock faces, exposed soils and beaches. Land use within the Finnish part of the catchment of the lake consists of mostly of forest, which takes up 56.6% of the total area of ; swamp accounts for another 27.2%; agricultural land takes 6.1%; with residential area and others using up 5.5%. The basin area is inhabited by 83,400 people (41,700 rural and 41,700 urban population). The two towns in the basin are Nurmes, at the northern tip of the lake, and Lieksa on the eastern shore, which have a population of 18,700 and 11,500 respectively. The Koli National Park forms the western shore of the lake. Map of the lake The wooded vegetation is mainly made up of coniferous forests (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies), partly deciduous forests (Betula sp.) with the drainage basin categorized as belonging to the northern zone of conifers. The herbaceous vegetation in marsh areas consists of various grasses (Poaceae), sedge (Carex sp.) and moss (Sphagnum sp.). The agricultural crops grown in the area are barley, oat, grass and potato, which are mainly used for feeding domestic animals. It is, however, reported that agricultural use is on the decline. The primary industries in the basin are related to milk, meat and wood. The secondary industries in the basin consist of cardboard, sawed goods, milk products and rubber products. The periphery of the lake has a large network of roads and, during winter when the lake freezes, an ice road is the short route from one bank to the other. Road 73 passes through the Uimaharju on the southern side of the lake and goes through very scenic spots to the east end. The south end of the lake has a lock system at Pielisjoki, which connects to the Saimaa Lake. Climate The climatic data has been recorded at the two major towns in the lake basin, namely the Lieksa and Juuka during the period between 1931 and 1960. At Lieksa, the average annual rainfall was with mean minimum and maximum temperatures recorded as (December) and (July). During the same period, the average rainfall at Juuka was and the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded were (December) and (July) respectively. The lake freezes, on average, during the period from 21 November to 14 May, according to records from the years 1960 to 1980. Flora The phytoplankton species recorded in the lake are Chlamydomonas spp., Monoraphidium confortum, M. dykowskii, Scenedesmus spp., Tabellaria flocculosa, T. fenestrata, Melosira sp., Mallomonas sp., Synura sp., Dinobryon sp., Merismopedia warmingiana, Anabaena flos-aquae and Aphanizomenon gracile. Fauna The fauna in the lake consists of eight types of benthos and ten types of fish species, out of which nine are economically important. The benthos recorded in the lake are: Insecta ‚Äì Dicrotenipeds pulsus, Glyptotendipens spp., Polypedilum pullum, Chaoborus flavicans, Stictochironomus spp., Tanytarsus spp. and Oligochaeta ‚Äì Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri. Salmon, which was previously endemic in the lake, is now extinct. Other fish species still found are: Perca fluviatilis, Esox lucius, Rutilus rutilus, Coregonus albula, C. mulesum, C. lavaretus, Lota lota, Abramis brama, Stizostedion lucioperca and Salmo trutta lacustris. Water quality The lake is categorized as mesotrophic. However, there are pockets of eutrophication zones. Bogs dominate the basin area, which causes flow of humic substances into the lake water. This has resulted in the lake water attaining a dark colour. This feature is said to be a typical characteristic of the lakes in Finland. Other parameters of chemical and physical properties of the lake waters measured relate to transparency (in meters), pH value, dissolved oxygen, COD, and concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus. Uses The lake is used for navigation, particularly for the transportation of timber; timber floated in the Pielinen Lake is estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year. Other uses are as a fishery resource (the fish catch in 1981 was reported at 644 tonnes), fish products of vendace and burbot, and for recreational purposes to promote tourism. Swimming, sport-fishing and yachting are common attractions. The lake provides water to the extent of per day to industries and power plants. Threats Siltation is not an issue. However, toxic contaminants are regularly monitored including mercury, zinc, copper and DDT to ensure that the standards prescribed under food safety standards, or tolerance limits for the safe use of water, are fully maintained. There is very limited pollution from sewage, municipal wastes and industrial uses, as adequate standards for sewage treatment and sanitary facilities are maintained. Regulations The basic National law that governs the lake and its basin is the Water law (1961, revised 1987) of Finland. The governmental ministries and agencies of Finland responsible for the complete upkeep of the lake are the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the National Board of Waters and Environment. Attractions Two major attractions around Pielinen Lake are Koli National Park and Paalasmaa Island. =Koli National Park= Lake Pielinen, a view from a hill in Koli National Park The Koli National Park is studded with islands, which are glorified in the Finnish national anthem as an important Finnish symbol. It was declared a National Park in 1991, after an intense debate between the environmentalist lobby and the owners of the land property over the location of the Hotel Koli, which stands at the top of its namesake hill. This park and its environs, which spread over a width of , has inspired Finnish artists Pekka Halonen and Eero J√§rnefelt to create artistic paintings with its scenic beauty. It is approachable by ferry from the mainland. As a popular winter sport resort, this park provides the adventure sports of hiking and boating during summer; it has a network of walking paths, which cover nearly . A road link is also available to the hotel from the car park at the lower level. The highest point on the hill top is called the Ukko-Koli, which is linked to another peak called the Akka Koli. On the western side of Akka Koli is the \\"Temple of Silence,\\" which is a place for meditation. There is stone altar here and a cross mounted on the rock. Another peak close nearby is known as the Paha-Koli and to its south is the scenic view point known as M√§kr√§vaara. The Koli Village, within the park premises, has the information office, Internet facility and a post office. The visitor centre at the park is called the Luontokeskus Ukko (Ukko Nature Centre), where exhibitions are held on the history, nature and geology of the park. Two ski centres, used during the winter, are established here; they are known as Ukko-Koli and Loma-Koli, both of which boast nine lifts and of cross country trails, with lighting along of the trail. It is one of the most accessible ski resorts in Finland. The hills here are covered with pine and birch trees.Symington, pp. 183‚Äì184 The national park has nine basic huts and camping grounds. There are also a marina and swimming beach on the shores of the lake, where a Finnish dancing stage called the huvilava stands. Row boats are also available for rowing across the lake. =Paalasmaa Island= The Paalasmaa Island is the largest in the lake, with its peak rising to above mean sea level. Access to the island is through ferry services. An observatory tower stands on the island; old houses that reflect the history of the island can be seen along a trail marked tornille (to the tower).Symington, p.184 Ice Road Pielinen hosts an ice road, during most winters, between the villages of Koli and Vuonislahti. The ice road is long and shortens the road distance between the two villages by . The date of opening varies depending on the climatic conditions each year; the earliest the road ever opened was during the 2010-2011 winter, on the 15th day of December. Previously the winter of 1995-1996 had witnessed the earliest opening, on the 29th day of December. In the winter of 2009-2010, the road did not open until mid-January, whilst in 2008-2009 the road opened in mid- February. Helsingin Sanomat has stated that the road is probably the longest of its kind in Europe; however, this assertion is incorrect, as the Hiiumaa Ice Road in Estonia is 25 km, and is more widely believed to Europe's longest. Popular interest The asteroid 1536 Pielinen is named after the Pielinen Lake.

Such public events are also known as a Liederfest, or song festival. Participants number in the hundreds and thousands, and the fest is usually accompanied by a parade and other celebratory events. The s√§ngerfest is most associated with the Germanic culture. Its origins can be traced back to 19th century Europe. Swiss composer Hans Georg N√§geli and educator Carl Friedrich Zelter, both prot√©g√©s of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, established s√§ngerbunds to help foster social change throughout Germany and Prussia. University students began to choose the art form as an avenue for political statements. As the s√§ngerfest concept gained popularity and spread around the world, it was adapted by Christian churches for spiritual worship services. European immigrants brought the tradition in a non-political form to the North American continent. In the early part of the 20th century, s√§ngerfest celebrations drew devotees in the tens of thousands, and included some United States presidents among their audiences. S√§ngerbunds are still active in Europe and in American communities with Germanic heritage. History=Europe= S√§ngerfest 1928 in Vienna Students of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, a proponent of social reform, applied his teachings when founding some singing groups as an instrument for cultural change. One of his students was Carl Friedrich Zelter, who helped establish the s√§ngerbund movement throughout Prussia in 1809. Pestalozzi's prot√©g√© Hans Georg N√§geli was a composer, music teacher and songbook publisher who made numerous journeys across Germany from 1819 to encourage the formation of male singing groups for social reform. N√§geli established several s√§ngerbunds in Switzerland, which became the inspiration for the 1824 establishment of the Stuttgarter Liederkranz. Following the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees in Germany, male-only choral celebrations with hundreds or thousands of vocalists were popular with the masses and often part of political events. Liederkranz Quartettverein from Velbert Germany Composer Friedrich Silcher was directly influenced by Pestalozzi and N√§geli. He began using large choirs to express political viewpoints at least as early as 1824 when he and a group of T√ºbingen University students performed La Marseillaise to commemorate the storming of the Bastille. In 1827 at Plochingen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, several male-voiced choirs combined for a regional liederfest. S√§ngerfests were part of the Hambach Festival of 1832. Christian church organizations known as Christlicher s√§ngerbunds adapted the s√§ngerfest for religious gatherings and helped spread its popularity throughout Europe, North America and Australia. They became popular in late 19th century Russia among Mennonite congregations. On 30 May 1893, a s√§ngerfest of seven choirs was held in R√ºckenau in Molotschna, Ukraine. On Sunday, 29 May 1894, the all-day Russische Saengervereinigung was held in R√ºckenau under the direction of Polish conductor Friedrich Schweige with assistance from Aron Gerhard Sawatsky, director of the Andreasfeld Mennonite Brethren Church. Beginning on 3 May, Schweiger traveled across Russia rehearsing choirs. On 29 May there were breakfasts for attendees, an estimated 50 vocal presentations by individual choirs, prayer services and sermons, lunch for 2,000 people and afternoon snacks. =North America= Mennonites established the northwest Philadelphia section of Germantown in 1683. The Philadelphia M√§nnerchor founded by German immigrant Phillip Matthias Wohlseiffer in 1835 was the first German-American singing society organized in the United States where the s√§ngerfest began to evolve as a form of civic entertainment. In 1836, Wohlseiffer founded the Baltimore Liederkranz, which became the first to accept women members (1838). In 1846, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, group and the Baltimore, Maryland, group performed together at a public s√§ngerfest. The \\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac\\" of 1891 listed numerous s√§ngerbunds in the Brooklyn, New York area. On 21 June 1901, the Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund presented a s√§ngerfest in Buffalo, New York, at the famous Pan-American Exposition (where 25th President William McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz in a reception line in September 1901). A group in Buffalo hoped to help pay the expenses of the fest by forming the Buffalo S√§ngerfest Company, selling 1,600 shares of stock at $25 each. In 1838, the Cincinnati Deutscher Gesangverein was formed in Ohio, followed by the Cincinnati Deutsch Liedertafel in 1844. The Gesang und Bildungsverein Deutscher Arbeiter formed in 1846 and was the first Cincinnati group that allowed women. Groups from Ohio, Kentucky, Maryland and Indiana created the Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund in 1849 for a s√§ngerfest hosted by Cincinnati, featuring the music of German composers. By 1908, it was estimated that 250,000 German Americans belonged to musical organizations, and 50,000 of those belonged to the Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund. The first post-Civil War s√§ngerfest in Columbus, Ohio, took place 29 August ‚Äì 1 September 1865 at Schreiner's Hall and the Opera House. Each arriving s√§ngerbund was escorted to the hall by the Eighteenth regiment of the United States Infantry. There were an estimated 400 singers entertaining 12,000 to 15,000 attendees. The closing day was celebrated with pomp and circumstance. The first s√§ngerfest in Texas was held in 1853 in New Braunfels, and was held annually until 1860 when conflicting loyalties about, and participation in, the American Civil War caused a 10-year gap in the events. The San Antonio M√§nnergesang-Verein was formed in 1847, the New Braunfels Gesangverein Germania formed in 1850, and the Austin M√§nnerchor formed in 1852. On 4 July 1853 in San Antonio, the San Antonio M√§nnergesang-Verein sponsored an Independence Day celebration attended by the New Braunfels Gesangverein and the Austin M√§nnerchor. The New Braunfels Gesangverein invited everyone to meet in New Braunfels on 16‚Äì17 October 1853 for its first Texas S√§ngerfest. In 1854, the aggregate s√§ngerbunds formed the Texas State S√§ngerbund. The San Antonio Beethoven M√§nnerchor was organized in 1867 by Wilhelm Thielepape, assistant conductor of the San Antonio M√§nnergesang- Verein. After the surrender of the Confederacy in 1865, Thielepape raised the Union flag of the \\"Stars and Stripes\\" over the historic Texan battle site and former church mission, the Alamo in San Antonio and distributed wine and songbooks. The all-male Houston S√§ngerbund was founded on 6 October 1883 and chartered in 1890. It affiliated itself with Der Deutsch-Texanische S√§ngerbund. In 1887, founding member Carl C. Zeus served as principal of the organization's German-English school. 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland, his wife, and guests took a special train from Washington, D.C. on \\"Independence Day\\", 4 July 1888, forty miles northeast to see a Baltimore event. Cleveland had friends who were members of the s√§ngerbunds. 27th President William Howard Taft attended the 1 July 1912 event in Philadelphia. On 15 June 1903, 26th President Theodore Roosevelt and Ambassador Herman Speck von Sternberg attended a s√§ngerfest of 6,000 individual singers at Baltimore's Armory Hall. All 9,000 seats were sold out. President Roosevelt delivered an address praising the German culture and the s√§ngerfest tradition. The Northeastern S√§ngerbund presented selections by composers Herman Spielter, David Melamet, Carl Friedrich Z√∂llner, E.S. Engelsberg, Felix Mendelssohn and Richard Wagner. When Newark, New Jersey, hosted the 21st National S√§ngerfest, held on 1‚Äì4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 people showed up to hear the music, many arriving on chartered trains. Only a few thousand were able to get into the hall, and 2,000 were standing. Five thousand singers from more than a hundred s√§ngerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel. Germans began emigrating to Canada through Nova Scotia, where they helped found the town of Lunenburg in 1753. The s√§ngerfests were first performed in Kitchener, Ontario, in 1862. The community events included the standard concerts and meals, with drama presentations and athletic entertainment sponsored by the local Turnvereine clubs. For the next 40 years, s√§ngerbunds and s√§ngerfests spread throughout Ontario. Pennsylvania Mennonites began settling in Ontario in the late 19th century. Alberta and Saskatchewan host annual Mennonite s√§ngerfestes. In 1916 at his sentencing for bigamy, Count Max Lymer Louden related another misdeed from his past. Louden claimed he had been hired by a group of wealthy German Americans with a secret fund of $16,000,000 to take 150,000 German reservists, disguised as s√§ngerbunds, across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border for a coup d'√©tat of Canada, on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II. If they drew suspicion, they were prepared to \\"sing at a moment's notice.\\" It was his loyalty to America, he claimed, which caused him to desert the Kaiser's singing invasion force. Current events Although some local festivals were canceled or suspended during the two world wars owing to rising anti-German sentiment, the triennial S√§ngerfest tradition has largely survived and many communities in areas with a significant German- American population have S√§ngerfests today. Two major German-American singing associations are the Nord√∂stlicher (North Eastern) S√§ngerbund and the much larger Nord-Amerikanischer (North American) S√§ngerbund (which, contrary to the name, also includes a few choruses from southern states). * Nord√∂stlicher S√§ngerbund: The 49th S√§ngerfest was in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 2006. The 50th S√§ngerfest, hosted by the Washington S√§ngerbund, took place on the 2009 Memorial Day Weekend in Washington, D.C. The 51st S√§ngerfest, hosted by the Lehigh S√§ngerbund, took place in June 2012 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Bloomfield Liedertafel hosted the 52nd S√§ngerfest in 2015 in Pittsburgh, PA. * Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund: The 61st S√§ngerfest of the Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund was June 2013 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with over 1300 singers. The 62nd S√§ngerfest will take place May 27‚Äì29, 2016 in Pittsburgh, PA.

In 1978 it was released by Ravensburger in Germany, where the game became a huge hit. It has since sold some 2 million units in at least ten languages, including several known pirated editions. The current edition is published by Gibsons Games in the UK, Ravensburger in Germany and Rio Grande Games in the United States. Theme The game is based on Aesop's fable \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\", in which the hare and tortoise decide to race. The tortoise wins the race by cunning while the hare fails because he overestimates himself and takes a nap during the race. The moral of the story is \\"slow and steady wins the race\\" which is incorporated in the game mechanic. In Germany, there is another fable by a similar name, Hase und Igel (Hare and hedgehog), made popular by the Brothers Grimm, in which the hedgehog wins because his wife is at the finish line, and the hare mistakes her for his race opponent. Gameplay Hare and Tortoise The game used a then-new (as of 1974) game mechanic. Until then, movement of pieces in race games was largely determined by the roll of dice. In Hare and Tortoise players pay carrots (the currency in the game) to move forward. The more squares the player wants to advance, the more carrots the player must pay. The cost to advance increases as triangle numbers: * 1 square = 1 carrot * 2 squares = price of 1 square + 2 = 3 carrots * 3 squares = price of 2 squares + 3 = 6 carrots * 4 squares = price of 3 squares + 4 = 10 carrots * And so on. Players can earn carrots in various ways ‚Äì most notably by moving backwards to designated squares (10 carrots per square). This game mechanic creates an interesting and dynamic race usually with no clear winner until the very end. The players start the game with 65 carrots. The gameboard features 65 squares. There are no generic squares; instead, the board is divided in several types of squares such as hare (draw a luck card), carrots (get extra carrots for each turn skipped), etc. The factor of luck can be eliminated completely from the game by agreement between the players not to land on \\"hare\\" squares. Only one earlier \\"strategic race game\\" is known: Bantu, published by Parker Brothers in 1955 which, however, did not serve as a model for Hare and Tortoise.Parlett, David. The Oxford History of Board Games. London: OUP, 1999. p. 103. Awards In 1979, the game became the first winner of the now widely recognized Spiel des Jahres award.

It was among his five personal favorite novels from his own oeuvre. Plot summary When the galaxy's most skilled hunter is asked to use his skill to protect an important political mission, he realizes that he needs specialized aid. Thus Billy Singer must seek the shape-shifting telepathic creature only known as \\"Cat\\", whom he had caught and trapped for a museum. Cat agrees to help on the condition that, once the mission is over, he be given the chance to hunt his former captor. Billy accepts Cat's offer. However, Billy has been growing increasingly fatalistic in the time leading up to the story, and originally offers to let Cat kill him with no struggle. Cat, a hunter refuses, encouraging Billy to flee. Billy does so, but remains fatalistic, with Cat reading in his mind a wish to die and his foreknowledge of a final location. Billy must reconcile his personal chindi to evade Cat. Billy turns increasingly primitive, away from the technology of the day, and eventually returns to his Navajo roots. Traveling across the world using teleportation technology, he eventually comes to Canyon de Chelly where he regresses to a state where he can, or believes he can, walk in the spirit world. At the same time, a collection of psychics try to pool their powers to help him and to attack Cat. Cat is able to kill one by destroying his mind, but even so the dead man seems to linger as a part of their group consciousness. Billy is eventually able to kill Cat, but then has to face his chindi, who is his deathwish, in a battle that pits him against his own shadow. The novel ends with Billy apparently united with his other self. Notes The dedication page reads \\"To Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee\\", two Navajo Tribal Police characters in detective stories by Tony Hillerman. Zelazny took much inspiration from Hillerman's stories of Navajo life and culture. Hillerman repaid the compliment by having one of his characters reading a Zelazny novel while on a stakeout. The creature \\"Cat\\" is referred to as a Torglind Metamorph, last of its kind from a planet long since destroyed when its star went nova. The alien's plight parallels that of Billy Singer, who has become displaced from his people and traditions. The book also contains several long cosmogonic poems with many beings from the Navajo pantheon in as characters.

It is within the civil parish of Staintondale and the North York Moors National Park, and is north of Scarborough. A National Trail, the Cleveland Way, passes through Ravenscar, which is also the eastern terminus of the Lyke Wake Walk. The official end of the Walk is at a point where the path meets the coast road.  History  Peak Alum Works Ravenscar was the location of a late 4th century Roman signal station, part of a chain that extended along the Yorkshire coast. To the north of the village is the old Peak alum works,The Science at Peak Alum works. now a National Trust site, but once an important part of the dyeing industry. The last alum works at Ravenscar closed down in 1871 after the invention of a synthetic dye fixer. At the edge of the village is a disused windmill, Peak Mill, which dates from 1858. Until the early 20th century Ravenscar was known as 'Peak' or 'The Peak'. At the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th century, plans were made to turn the village into a holiday resort to rival nearby Scarborough. Roads were laid out, some houses were built and sewers were laid. Because of the long trek to its rocky beach, Ravenscar never achieved popularity, and the development was left unfinished ‚Äì a town with sewers and streets but no houses. The village was served by Ravenscar railway station between 1885 and 1965. =Peak House/Raven Hall= Raven Hall Hotel (previously Peak House) In 1540, a farm known as Peak House owned by the Beswick family occupied the site of a 5th-century Roman fort. In 1774 Raven Hall was built on the site for Captain William Childs of London, a captain in the King's Regiment of Light Dragoons, who came to Yorkshire with the army and became the owner of the Alum Works at Ravenscar. On his death in 1829 the hall passed to his daughter Ann Willis, whose family (headed by Dr Francis Willis) had become wealthy from treating George III and other royalty for their medical conditions. Ann's son, the eccentric Rev Dr Richard Willis, built the gardens and battlements which surround the house. In 1845 the property passed into the hands of William Hammond of London. Hammond became a prominent local benefactor, building the village church and the windmill. He became a director of the Scarborough to Whitby railway line, insisting that it passed through his property via a tunnel and that Ravenscar should have a station. On his widow's death in 1890 the estate was sold to the Peak Estate Company for development as a holiday resort. The house was extended for use as a hotel from 1895, and its golf course opened in 1898. It was sold by auction in 1911 after the company went bankrupt, and after several changes of ownership and use as a billet in wartime it was acquired by the present owners, who are associated with Classic Hotels.  Popular culture  The name of the village is featured in a double episode (The Swords of Wayland) of the 1980s television show, Robin of Sherwood. The locations for Ravenscar, as featured in the episodes, were filmed at Cornwall and Somerset. The exterior of Ravenscar Castle was Saint Michael's Mount, and the interior, in particular the room where the seven swords were kept, was Wells Cathedral. The comic book anti-hero John Constantine was committed to the (fictional) Ravenscar Lunatic Asylum in the Hellblazer series of comics after a disastrous summoning. He returned there throughout the series. The fictional character Roger Comstock in the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson has the royal title \\"Marquis of Ravenscar\\".

Circa 2006. A CRT projector is a video projector that uses a small, high-brightness cathode ray tube as the image generating element. The image is then focused and enlarged onto a screen using a lens kept in front of the CRT face. The first color CRT projectors came out in the early 1950s. Most modern CRT projectors are color and have three separate CRTs (instead of a single, color CRT), and their own lenses to achieve color images. The red, green and blue portions of the incoming video signal are processed and sent to the respective CRTs whose images are focused by their lenses to achieve the overall picture on the screen. Various designs have made it to production, including the \\"direct\\" CRT-lens design, and the Schmidt-CRT, which employed a phosphor screen that illuminates a perforated spherical mirror, all within an evacuated \\"tube.\\" The image in the Sinclair Microvision \\"flat\\" CRT is viewed from the same side of the phosphor struck by the electron beam. The other side of the screen can be connected directly to a heat sink, allowing the projector to run at much brighter power levels than the more common CRT arrangement. \\"Innovation in electronics\\" by Alan Burkitt \\"Electronics Servicing & Technology\\" magazine 1982 July Though systems utilizing projected video at one time almost exclusively used CRT projectors, they have largely been replaced by other technologies such as LCD projection and Digital Light Processing. Improvements in these digital video projectors, and their subsequent increased availability and desirability, resulted in a drastic decline of CRT projector sales by the late 2000s. As of 2012, very few (if any) new units are manufactured, though a number of installers do sell refurbished units, generally higher-end 8\\" and 9\\" models . Advantages and disadvantages=Advantages= *Long service life; CRT's maintain good brightness to 10,000 hours. *No bulbs to replace after only a couple thousand hours (as with xenon-backlit DLP and LCD), however CRT projectors can accumulate burn-in if set to a high contrast value and/or displaying static content over time *High-end CRT projectors can precisely display images up to 1920 x 1200 Barco Cine 9, Sony G90The Barco 912 claims an addressable resolution of 3200 x 2560, however with a bandwidth of 180 MHz it is not able to resolve fine detail at this resolution with the same clarity as other display technologies would *Because of the good black levels, CRT projectors are good contenders to be used in edge-blend setups. DLP and LCD projector edge blend setups show a visible gray seam in the middle in dark scenes. Because of their 4:3 picture tubes, edge-blended CRTs use a larger surface area of the tubes when showing video in a cinemascope aspect ratio, which reduces uneven wear and yields higher total brightness. CRT projector stacking is also possible. *Superior overall black level compared to LCD and DLP based projectors , however some smaller air-coupled CRT projectors exhibit an effect known as blooming or haloing around bright objects displayed on a dark background *As with CRT monitors, the image resolution and the refresh rate are not fixed but variable within some limits. Interlaced material can be played directly, without need for imperfect deinterlacing mechanisms . *Zero input lag and zero motion blur, which makes them very suitable for video games of all kinds, as well video with fast motion (for example football or other sports) *Many CRT projectors are multiscan-capable, with a horizontal frequency range starting at 15KHz in the bottom end, on some projectors going all the way up to 150 or 180KHz. This means that CRT projectors are resolution compatible with a lot of video sources, including standard definition TV and retro games (15.7KHz), VCRs, arcade games (15.7KHz, 24KHz and 31KHz), older VGA computers (31KHz), modern computers (typically 48KHz for 768p60, 68KHz for 768p85, 67KHz for 1080p60 or 137KHz for 4k60), HDTV (45KHz for 720p60, 28KHz for 1080i50, 67KHz for 1080p60), modern video game consoles, and more, without the need for upscaling or downscaling. This is advantageous over for example CRT computer monitors, of which all the ones from the mid-90s or later are also multisync capable, but have a lower frequency limit of 30KHz, making 480p60 or 240p120 the lowest resolution possible, thus needing upscaling to work with retro games and arcade games. *CRT projectors do not show a rainbow effect seen with single chip DLP projectors . *CRT projectors are made of three separate monochrome picture tubes, aimed, focused, converged on the same screen, thus there is no screen-door effect whatsoever (however a properly set up CRT projector showing a small resolution (for example 240p as used in older video games) is able to show distinctly sharp scan lines with black areas in between *Some CRT projectors, like the Dwin 500 and 700, include no fans and are much quieter than comparable LCD or DLP projectors. Many CRT projectors feature large-size fans and temperature control and some can be easily modified for quieter and/or better performing cooling. The components in CRT projectors feature large surface areas compared to compact, bright Xenon-bulb lit DLP or LCD projectors. *Three separate lenses reduce the risk of running into chromatic aberration problems in the corners of the picture, because each lens can be adjusted separately to account for three different wavelengths =Disadvantages= *CRT projectors are both considerably larger and heavier than comparable LCD and DLP projectors.The Sony G70 weighs 83 kg and measures 0.36 x 0.7 x 0.95 m whereas an LCD based projector weighs 3.6 kg and measures 0.09 x 0.34 x 0.26 m *CRT projectors require far more time to set up and adjust than LCD and DLP based projectors. *Absolute ANSI brightness achievable with CRT projectors is lower than with comparable lamp-powered LCD and DLP projectors. *Low-end or poorly tuned CRT projectors may suffer from color divergence or geometric distortion (for example, straight lines may not always appear completely straight, especially near the corners). *CRT projectors use more power / cost more to run than LCD and DLP units. It is however comparable to Plasma displays, which are also comparable in picture quality and performance. *Unlike LCD or DLP projectors, CRT projectors are more prone to burn-in, if set to relatively a high contrast value and/or displaying static content for extended periods of time. This can lead to issues in brightness uniformity on projectors that frequently use both a full 4:3 and widescreen aspect ratio, as well as a change in colour temperature as the blue (and green) phosphors wear faster than the red. Overall burn-in is also a problem when moving or buying/selling CRT projectors, as different locations and different setups end up using different portions of the surface of the picture tubes. Projector CRTs can be either air or liquid coupled. Air coupled projector CRTs have a front flat face container with coolant, and there is an air gap between the face of the CRT and the flat back lens. Liquid coupled projector CRTs have a curved face with coolant and a screen that is curved towards the inside with a dichroic coating, the coating increases light output while the curvature conforms it to the curved back lens of the projector, reducing image halos. There is also no air gap between the CRT and the lens. Glycol is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture) even through the silicon seals used in the CRTs to contain the glycol. This means that eventually the glycol can have too much water, breaking the glass of the container when it expands due to heat. This mainly affects Air coupled CRTs as in these the air bubble is on the same space as the container while Liquid coupled CRTs are not as affected since they have separate flexible silicone bellows which form the air bubble. The glycol may also react with the aluminum in the CRT cooling system and crystallize over many cooling and heating cycles creating CRT fungus, which degrades image quality since its optical properties are different than that of the surrounding glycol.http://www.curtpalme.com/Fungus_Removal1.shtm A lens assembly is placed over the CRT to project its image onto a screen.

The village has a population of 229. History The name of the village probably comes from a Saxon settler and means \\"Ceaffa's valley\\". After the Norman Conquest Chaffcombe was granted to the Bishop of Coutances under whom it was held by Ralph le Sor until it was acquired by Oliver Avenel (died 1226) and inherited by his descendants until 1613 when John Poulett of Hinton St George became lord of the manor and stayed in the Poulett family until 1913. The parish of Chaffcombe was part of the South Petherton Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Landmarks Avishays on Whiteway Hill is a large detached house which was partly built in the 17th century, but substantially altered between 1745 and 1759. The building was first recorded in 1316 as Aveneleseigh, from Oliver Avenel, and then changed hands many times. In the 17th century the Browne family leased it to the Sealy family, who purchased it in 1697, thereafter descendants of the Sealy family held it until it was sold to a Chard solicitor, Edward Clarke, in 1859. In the grounds are an 18th-century former stables and coach house, ice house and various other outbuildings. The Clock Turret about 180 metres east of Avishays, which is also known as the Monmouth Tower or The Castle, is a 19th-century folly. It stands on the site of a former sham castle which had fallen into ruin, and served as a water tower as well as having a clock on the west side facing the house. The clock, which has a hand wound mechanism, was built by Gillett and Johnson of Croydon and was originally at Highclere Castle in Hampshire. The name Monmouth Tower comes from the escape of Elias Sealy, who owned the house, a follower of the Duke of Monmouth during the Monmouth Rebellion, who hid in a tree in the grounds when the troops of James II came looking for him. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Michael and All Angels has a tower which partly dates from the 15th century, the remainder being rebuilt under J. M. Allen between 1857 and 1860. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. There is a copy of Raphael's Madonna and Child in the north aisle, which was acquired in 1901.

Early life  Munro cites a tough childhood with an abusive and alcoholic mother, as one of the main reasons behind his motivation to succeed. Munro attended Sacred Heart Primary School in Mosman, New South Wales and Marist College North Shore in North Sydney. He began his career at 17 as a copyboy on The Daily Mirror in 1971. He stayed in newspapers for 7 years, before trying television and not liking it. So he returned to newspapers when Rupert Murdoch sent him to New York to work in the NewsCorp bureau writing for newspapers in Great Britain and Australia.  Television career  In 1982 he returned to Sydney and television, where he started as a senior reporter in the Channel 10 newsroom. In 1984, he joined the Nine Network and Mike Willessee on the \\"Willessee\\" current affairs program. Two years later he replaced George Negus as the fifth male reporter on 60 Minutes, where he remained for the next seven years, becoming well known for his interviews with celebrities including Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler and Katharine Hepburn. Munro became a reporter and later the host of A Current Affair. In 1996, Munro was the reporter at the centre of the infamous Paxton family expose. Munro was replaced as the host of the show in 2003. His then boss, Peter Meakin subsequently described Munro's situation/demeanour at that time as \\"a little on the nose, a little out of favour, a little too brash\\". Meakin added that he did \\"really admire his (Munro's) courage and his grace\\" ... \\"in those last few months at A Current Affair because he did a brilliant job\\" even when he knew he was going to lose the role. Munro said he lost the role because he was continually complaining to management about A Current Affair becoming 'A Consumer Affair' and no longer doing serious investigations, instead focusing on consumer and diet stories. For Munro, the final straw came on the night he had to introduce another reporter's story on a toothbrush survey. He is synonymous with the biographical show This Is Your Life, which he hosted from 1995 until 2005 and then again in 2008. In 2005 he replaced Georgie Gardner on National Nine News Afternoon Edition. In 2006 he stepped down from National Nine News Afternoon Edition but continued to present Sydney's National Nine News weekend news, he remained in this position until 2008. Also in 2006, Munro hosted the television series Missing Persons Unit and What a Year, alongside Megan Gale, which first aired on the Nine Network on 2 October 2006. But in 2007, they were replaced by Bert Newton and Julia Zemiro and since then the show had been axed. On 26 October 2008, Munro resigned from the Nine Network after 22 years with the network. On 7 January 2009, he signed a three-year contract with rival Seven Network to become the founding host of a new current affairs program Sunday Night. In addition to this, he also substituted for David Koch on the top-rating breakfast show, Sunrise. In January 2014, Network Ten announced that Munro had joined the network. On 9 February 2014, he commenced as the presenter of Ten Eyewitness News Weekend. Munro later resigned in protest from Network Ten, after completing his 12-month contract, due to dozens of staff being retrenched from the News department.http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/12/mike-munro-quits- ten.html In 2014, Munro was made a member of the Order of Australia for his community work and services to journalism. In 2017, Munro hosted and helped to produce a four part science-based documentary series for Foxtel's History Channel on Bushrangers. Lawless - The Real Bushrangers The four episodes featured the crime scenes of Ned Kelly, Ben Hall, Captain Moonlite, and the Kenniff brothers. One of the one-hour specials included Munro's great uncles, Paddy and Jimmy Kenniff, one of whom was hanged in Brisbane jail in 1903 after being convicted of murdering a police constable and a station manager in the Carnarvon Ranges in Queensland. In 2018, Munro hosted Mateship ‚Äì Australia & USA: A Century Together, a one-hour documentary on Foxtel's History channel celebrating 100 years of the close bonds that unite Australia and America. Since 4 July 1918, the United States of America and Australia have never fought a major war without each other. It is one of the longest alliances in modern history.https://www.historychannel.com.au/shows/mateship-australia-usa- a-century-together/ In August 2019 HarperCollins published Munro's book, The Last Bushrangers: When History Becomes Personal ‚Äî The Story of the Murderous Kenniff Gang.

The village has a population of 591. The parish also includes Stowell. The village lies on the Monarch's Way long- distance footpath that approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester. Charlton Horethorne in the 21st century is a village with successful businesses, a primary school and a village hall that was purchased in 1923 from the Army as a memorial to the fallen in the First World War. Despite its age and the fact that it was previously used as a wooden mess hall, it is used on a frequent and regular basis by a wide range of groups and activities. The village benefits from the presence of The Village Shop and a pub called The Kings Arms that offers food and accommodation.  History  Wynfl√¶d, circa AD 950, mentions land at Ceorlatune (11th-century copy, British Library Cotton Charters viii. 38)Charter S 1539 at the Electronic Sawyer The village was originally known just as Charlton, meaning \\"the farmers settlement\\" and then known as Charlton Kanville by 1225. In 1084 Horethorn was added coming from \\"Hareturna\\" meaning \\"grey thornbush\\". The parish was part of the hundred of Horethorne. Evidence of early human occupation of the parish is provided by three Bronze-Age barrows and a possible Iron-Age camp on the escarpment near Sigwells, an area to the west of the village where Mesolithic and Romano-British material has also been found. Around 950 the manor belonged to Wynflaed (d. c. 950), and may have passed to her daughter Aethelflaed. It was held by Vitel in 1066 and, by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, by Robert son of Gerold (d. 1102), who paid an annual rent of 100 cheeses. In 1439 it was bought by Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, who gave the manor to the Hospital of St Cross, Winchester in 1445. The Manor Farm House in Horse Lane was built as the local manor house in 1608. RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II) was a Royal Naval Air Service station in nearby Sigwells. It opened in 1942 as a flying training base under the administrative care of HMS Heron. It closed in 1948 and has since been returned to agricultural use.

His novels included Duel in the Sun (1944) and California Street. He was married to actress Teresa Wright for ten years beginning in 1942. Early career Born in New York City, Busch began his writing career in the early twenties, when he went to work for Time Magazine (co-founded by Busch's cousin, Briton Hadden). Before departing for Hollywood a decade later, Busch had risen to editor at the weekly, working simultaneously for The New Yorker, where he contributed profiles on famous Americans. (These articles were collected into his first book, the non-fiction Twenty-One Americans.) In 1932, realizing he had gone as far as he was likely to go as a New York-based magazine writer/editor, Busch re-connected with agent Myron Selznick, whom Busch knew through his father, an executive who had worked for Myron's father Lewis in the teens and early twenties. Myron Selznick soon secured work for Busch at Warner Bros. Pictures, and Busch decamped to Los Angeles to write his first film, Howard Hawks's The Crowd Roars. One of four writers on the production, Busch's name was misspelled in the credits. Film career Through the rest of the thirties, Busch worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, scripting mostly B-movies like The Big Shakedown. In 1938 he was nominated for an Academy Award for In Old Chicago, which was based on his story We the O'Learys, but failed to win. In 1940 he co-wrote The Westerner for director William Wyler and producer Samuel Goldwyn. Soon thereafter he went to work as Goldwyn's story editor, recommending Pride of the Yankees, in which Gary Cooper and Busch's soon-to-be wife Teresa Wright co-starred. Settling in the hills of Encino with his growing family, Busch began writing novels. The Carrington Incident, published in 1941, was followed by the best- seller Duel in the Sun, which Lewis Selznick's other son David purchased and turned into the 1946 blockbuster of the same title. He now alternated between the writing of screenplays and novels, most of which became best-sellers. They Dream of Home, a tale of returning veterans, was followed by The Furies (1950), which became a film that starred Barbara Stanwyck. Another notable film of the period ‚Äî for which Busch wrote the original screenplay ‚Äî was Pursued starring Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright, one of the first psychological Westerns with \\"noir\\" overtones. Around the same time, Busch also adapted the noir thriller The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), for Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. Later career In the early fifties, Busch and Wright divorced, and Busch left Hollywood for northern California, where he devoted himself to cattle ranching and the full-time writing of novels. There he would meet his fourth wife Carmencita Baker and fifth wife Suzanne de Sanz. Before Busch's final novel The Titan Game he had become one of San Francisco's leading literary lights and a Regent's Professor at the University of California. California Street is about the San Francisco newspaper publishing business, with the title taken from California Street in the city. Busch appears in the film The Unbearable Lightness of Being, playing the role of \\"Old Man\\" in the scene in which Sabina (Lena Olin) receives the letter informing her of T√≥mas and Tereza's deaths. Busch was 84 at the time of the filming. Busch died from congestive heart failure in 1991 at the age of eighty-eight.

There are also small settlements at Lytes Cary, Cary Fitzpaine (east of the A37 Fosse Way) and West Charlton. West Charlton is the shrunken remains of the original village of Charlton Mackrell. History The Fosse Way runs through the parish and Roman villa sites associated with it have been found at Windmill Hill. The parishes of Charlton Adam and Charlton Mackrell were part of the hundred of Somerton. In the 16th century two medieval fields were divided which delayed inclosure until the 18th century, leading to the current patchwork of fields. The Charltons have been home to several of the ancestors of politicians in the United States of America. Henry Adams and Edith Squire were married in the parish church in 1609 and she is thought to be the ancestor of Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Calvin Coolidge, as well as of Samuel Adams, who also signed the Declaration of Independence, while Presidents Millard Fillmore and William Howard Taft were descendants of her two sisters Ann and Margaret. The manor was bought around 1800 by William Dickinson of Kingweston whose family held it until 1930. A railway station served the village as part of the Great Western Railway, from 1905 to 1962.

Landmarks Charlton House, 2017 The Abbey, Charlton Adam is a small country house which dates from the 16th century. The house takes its name from the fact that it was the site of the Chantry Chapel of the Holy Spirit, founded in 1237, of which some fragments may be incorporated. The interiors contain some Elizabethan panelling and reused earlier bits and pieces. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Lytes Cary is larger and has parts which date from the 14th century. A Tudor great hall was added in the mid-15th century, and a great chamber and other rooms in 1533. Other rooms and ranges were added until the Lytes family sold the manor in the mid-18th century. It is now owned by the National Trust and is also Grade I listed.The Buildings of England, South and West Somerset, by Nikolaus Pevsner.

Religious sites The village is unusual in having two churches and two centres. The older Church of St Stephen dates from the 13th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The second centre is said to have originated when people fled to avoid the plague. The newer centre had no church until 1877 when a chapel of ease at Barrow Lane, dedicated to St John the Baptist, was given by Mrs. Emma Frances Davies (n√©e Leir), the widow of a former rector, daughter of Rev William Leir (1768‚Äì1863). It is of stone in a 13th-century style, designed by Charles Edward Davis of Bath, and comprises an apsidal chancel and a nave with a southern bell tower. The Leir family themselves have provided a number of rectors to the parish. Stavordale Priory, now a private home owned by Sir Cameron Mackintosh, is thought to be linked to the village's Old Church near the altar by a tunnel, perhaps used as a priest's escape route, some two miles in length. The building has 13th-century origins, having been founded by a member of the Lovel family, and was converted around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after the Priory merged with Taunton in 1533. The Priory of the Augustinian Order was first mentioned in 1243. The bell tower is known to have existed by 1374, and the church was refitted and rebuilt around 1439. The chantry of Jesus was described as having been \\"recently completed\\" in 1526. Notable people William Arnold an important master mason who flourished between 1595 and 1637 lived in the village in 1595 where he was church warden.

The cultural area includes the nation state of Solomon Islands and the Bougainville Island, which is a part of Papua New Guinea. The Solomon Islands includes some culturally Polynesian societies which lie outside the main region of Polynesian influence, known as the Polynesian Triangle.

The instrument was braced by a crossbar that stiffened the structure and provided a means of supporting its weight on the player's shoulder. Some specimens survive in the archaeological record, two from the ruins of Pompeii. Army signal horn (cornu); Roman period; found in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands The cornu may be difficult to distinguish from the buccina. It was used by the Roman army for communicating orders to troops in battle. In Roman art, the cornu appears among the instruments that accompany games (ludi) or gladiator combat in the arena, as on the Zliten mosaic.Thomas Wiedemann, Emperors and Gladiators (Routledge, 1992, 1995), p. 15. Military use The cornu was carried by the cornicen (horn-blower) who coded the general's orders into signals and broadcast them over the field during battles. The Roman army also made use of a straight trumpet called a tuba, which bore no resemblance to the modern tuba. The military writer Vegetius described the use of horns to give signals: Historical reenactor as a cornicen > The music of the legion consists of trumpets, cornets and buccinae. The > trumpet sounds the charge and the retreat.

The titles became extinct in 1988 on the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Baron. Geography The stream through Compton Pauncefoot is a tributary of the River Cam (Somerset). It travels under the A303 to join the Yarlington headwaters. The River Cam flows onto the Royal Naval Station where it joins the River Yeo and the Yeo in turn flows west to the south of Yeovilton and through the town of Ilchester. The river course continues to the west and at Langport becomes the River Parrett. The stream has its headwaters in the hills around Blackford & Compton Pauncefoot together with a number of springs. The main waters come from 3 primary sources: 1. Maperton, 2. Quarry Hill, 3. Sigwells Hill. The first 2 combine in Blackford around the Crossroads/Hollow and further springs contribute at a number of points all the way through both villages. The A303 is nearby and during construction major drainage pipes were laid at intervals that bring significant quantities of water into the stream. This contributes to the rapid rise in the stream during rainfall. The parish has no parish council and has a Parish Meeting which has limited responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover very limited permitted expenditure (basically minimal operating expenses and contribution to burial authority) and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish meeting helps evaluate local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish meeting's role also includes liaising with the district council over projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also matters that the parish meeting has a say on but no formal responsibility. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, major roads (except trunk routes such as the A303 which is the responsibility of the Highways Agency), public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome, a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Landmarks The Old Rectory Compton Castle was built for Mr Hussey Hunt about 1825, in a Gothic style with large grounds, gatehouse, and lawns stretching down to a lake. Manor House It was sold in 1986 by the Showering family (of Babycham fame). It should not be confused with Compton Castle (a fortified manor house in the village of Compton, about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of Torquay). The Old Rectory has Georgian, additions to an earlier building. Recently this house and the church were used quite extensively in a serialised version of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. The mainly 18th-century Manor House includes parts which date back to the 15th century. The Crescent is a quarter circle of cottages built in about 1815 for farm workers, and originally known as Waterloo Crescent. Religious sites The church dates from the 15th century and is built of hamstone. In 1485 Sir Walter Pauncefoot left money for the building of the church and for a chantry at Compton Pauncefoot, where a priest could pray daily for his soul and for those of his immediate family. He also left several yards of differently coloured silks to be made into vestments. Until 1864 the church comprised a nave with south aisle and porch, and a tower at the west. The inner arches of the tower carried a spire of graceful proportions. The north aisle was added in 1864, and at the same time the two stone coffins (now in the churchyard by the yew tree) were removed. The interior of the church can be viewed here and here. The font is 13th-century and is perfectly plain. There is a mass dial on the south wall. The frieze in the south aisle has part of a stone inscribed \\"Anne Whyting 1535.\\" In the wall under the sill of the adjacent window is a long stone panel divided into compartments, each containing a shield bearing coats of arms relating to the Whyting and Pauncefoot families. The south wall of the chancel contains a piscina with a stone button in the centre of the bowl. Five stained glass windows in the church are signed ‚Äî a rare phenomenon ‚Äî by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier of Brussels. The west window is by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1896. The church's three bells were cast in 1627, and one of them has the royal arms inscribed. The chancel was panelled with oak in 1934. The church registers date from 1559. The top of the spire became unsafe, and an appeal was launched in 1980, with the help of grants from the Department of the Environment and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. These efforts raised ¬£18,000 for the necessary work to be carried out. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The church is part of the Camelot Group of Parishes in the Diocese of Bath & Wells.

It is generally subdivided into the Great Clay Belt to the north running eastward from Kapuskasing, past Lake Abitibi and on to Amos, and the V-shaped Lesser Clay Belt to its south, running from Englehart down to the Wabi River to the northern tip of Lake Timiskaming, and long the eastern side of Timiskaming and back up to Rouyn- Noranda. The Clay Belt is the result of the draining of the Glacial Lake Ojibway around 8,200 BP, whose lakebed sediment forms the modern landform. The Clay Belt is surrounded by the Canadian Shield, forming an island of \\"southern flatlands\\" in the midst of the hilly and rocky surroundings. Similar \\"glaciolacustrine deposits\\" dot the northern areas of Ontario, Quebec and Labrador. Discovery This satellite photo of Lake Timiskaming shows a clear difference in landforms, with the muskeg of the Canadian Shield to the southwest and flatter drained and cleared area of the Lesser Clay Belt to the north and east. The white coloring is due to snow lying on the flat land, while it is hidden under the fir-covered Shield to the south. The area was first mapped by Dr. Robert Bell and his assistant Arthur Barlow in 1887, as part of a wider series of surveys in northern Ontario. In 1899, Barlow wrote a report on the geology and natural resources of the area, which suggested that the rich belt of clay that lay north of Lake Temiskaming was ideal for agricultural settlement. The area has a rich clay soil, in contrast to the low fertility of the muskeg and exposed bedrock shield surrounding it. Moreover, the combination of its general fertility, flat topography, high water table and relative accessibility to an extensive network of roads for logging and mining make it suitable for some types of farming. The following year, the government announced plans to develop the area by tapping its natural resources. Soon after, Bernhard Eduard Fernow traveled the area at the behest of the federal Commission of Conservation, ostensibly to survey the area of the Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line (formerly the Grand Trunk) and the potential for fire. He makes extensive mention of the condition of the timber, and has a somewhat tempered view of their potential commercial value. He then moves on to a somewhat more positive report on the soil and its suitability for farming, saying its future is \\"bright\\". Wishing to avoid the \\"Trent watershed\\" problem, an earlier failed settlement attempt, he suggested setting up an experimental farm to test what \\"treatment is necessary on the various soils\\". Such a farm was set up in Kapuskasing on the west side of the river to explore and develop crops and systems for farming the area. Promotion The Canadian government encouraged immigrants to settle there as farmers during and after World War I. Governments of the day were mistakenly impressed with the agricultural potential of the Great Clay Belt. Under the Soldier Settlement Act, 1917 (shortly replaced by the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919)now known as the the Soldier Settlement Board established the Kapuskasing Soldier Colony to settle veterans that had returned from the Great War. Settlers received homesteads, grants and guaranteed loans and were paid for clearing their own land. But by 1920 only nine of more than a hundred original settlers remained. The farming consisted of some grains, mostly oats, and vegetables. Graphic describing lands affected by The Forestry Act, 1927 The Ontario government also passed legislation in 1927The Forestry Act, 1927, S.O. 1927, c. 12 to enable the migration of farmers from barren lands in older parts of the Province, such as Haliburton County, to areas such as the Lesser Clay Belt through the exchange of land. In spite of numerous rocky outcrops some farming was successfully established within the Great Clay Belt, however, it proved to be impractical because of the short growing season. The clay soil is tremendously fertile, but long snowy winters coupled with unpredictable rainfall during the short growing season meant most farming yielded little. Decline By 1935, immigration to the Great Clay Belt virtually ended. One farmer, describing why he returned to urban life, stated that, in the Great Clay Belt, \\"there are seven months of snow, two months rain, and all the rest is black flies and mosquitoes.\\" Some of the farmers returned to Toronto and Montreal. Some moved west to the prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta once the National Transcontinental Railway was completed. Many of the farmers shifted to mining once minerals were found in the area. Others entered the logging industry. Some towns still remaining today include Cochrane, New Liskeard, Timmins, Kapuskasing, and Hearst. Neither the Great nor the Lesser Clay Belt seems able to attract any sort of sustainable industry to employ people for long periods of time. Both regions go through periodic boom and bust cycles, depending upon the fortunes of the pulp and paper industries, and the mining industries.

It is the third of the original Heralds of Valdemar trilogy. Plot summary Having completed her year and a half interning in the field, Talia returns to Haven as Queen's Own Herald in right. In her absence, the Council of Valdemar has been considering an offer of an alliance marriage between Princess Elspeth and the Prince of Hardorn, a young man named Ancar. While the Council is generally in favor, Queen Selenay has her suspicions about the idea, and she and Talia overrule the Council. Meanwhile, the budding lifebond between Talia and Herald Dirk is frustrated due to a misunderstanding - Dirk thinks Talia is in love with his best friend, the handsome Herald Kris. The problems of the kingdom occupy Talia's time so completely that she cannot speak to him, nor spend as much time with the young Princess as she used to. As a result, Dirk falls into depression (worsened by the death of a young Herald who was his special pupil) and begins drinking heavily. Elspeth, through the work of a trusted Councilor, Lord Orthallen, begins spending time with unsavory young men. Dirk is falsely accused by Orthallen, and when Kris (Orthallen's nephew) does not immediately believe his innocence, the two have a falling-out. Dirk's slide into depression continues, and he neglects his health until he collapses from pneumonia. Talia becomes caught up in all of these seemingly unsolvable problems and briefly loses her emotional footing, but her friends reassure her that the lifebond will work itself out in time. Then things fall apart again; Elspeth's new circle of male friends plan to seduce and then disgrace the Princess. Talia arrives just in time; she drives off the young cad, and then she and Elspeth have an argument. Afterwards, Talia confesses what she has done to Queen Selenay, who reassures her that she did the right thing by scolding Elspeth. The Queen then sends Talia and Kris on a mission to Hardorn to investigate Prince Ancar, in case the alliance marriage could be pursued after all. Talia and Kris (who has resolved his quarrel with Dirk) arrive in Hardorn, and witness Ancar murdering his own father and the Hardornen court. As they themselves are trying to escape, Kris and his Companion are killed, and Talia, wounded, is taken prisoner. Rolan, Talia's Companion, escapes, and Talia is able to use him to deliver a message to Selenay and her retinue, who would otherwise have come into the city. Warned, the Queen stops at the border between Hardorn and Valdemar. Talia has managed to convey to them that Kris is dead and that there is no hope for her. In desperation, Dirk and Elspeth use their Gifts (she is able to see at great distances, he is able to lift and move objects with his mind) and the strength of the Companion herd to pull her out of Ancar's dungeon. She is severely injured, for Ancar has tortured and raped her, and she drank a large amount of poison as a suicide attempt. The impossible feat leaves both Elspeth and Dirk incapacitated for some time. Talia revives and remembers some information Ancar has told her; Orthallen is a secret agent who is working for Hardorn because Ancar has promised to give him the throne. Through his manipulations, he has been working in various ways to see to it that Elspeth never becomes Queen. The Princess and Talia set up a trap to reveal his guilt; when he attacks the two women, Elspeth executes him. While still in recovery, Talia makes Dirk understand that she loves him. Ancar's army marches against Selenay, but she defeats them, and the two countries settle into an uneasy standstill. The hostile situation is not completely resolved until the end of the Mage Winds trilogy. The conclusion of the book is the wedding between Talia and Dirk.

Etymology The name Cricket St Thomas is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word \\"cruc,\\" meaning a hill or ridge. Descent of the manor The manor is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is described as \\"Land of the Count of Martin\\" paying tax to the king for six hides, or about . It had two slaves, six villagers, five smallholders and a variety of livestock and was valued for tax purposes at 100 shillings. It was at that time within the Hundred of South Petherton. In the 11th century the manor was held by the de Cricket family. In 1328-9 Michael de Cricket sold the manor to Walter de Rodney, who subsequently conveyed it to John of Clevedon.Victoria County History, Somerset, 1978, quoted by In 1466 it was acquired by Stephen Preston, whose great-grandson and last male descendant was John Preston, whose daughter and heiress Margaret Preston (d.1672), married John Hippisley of Ston Easton in Somerset, and thus Cricket St Thomas passed to her Hippisley descendants. In 1775 Richard Hippisley-Coxe sold it to Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport, 1st Baron Bridport (1726-1814), who although having married twice died childless and thus bequeathed it to his younger great-nephew Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport (1788-1868) (who inherited his Irish barony by special remainder), the husband of Charlotte Mary Nelson, 3rd Duchess of Bront√© (1787‚Äì1873), daughter and heiress of William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, 2nd Duke of Bront√© (1757‚Äì1835), elder brother and heir of the great Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, 1st Duke of Bront√© (1758‚Äì1805).

In 1999 the house was developed into a Warner Leisure Hotels resort. =Fictionalised as \\"Grantleigh Manor\\"= Cricket House was filmed as the fictitious \\"Grantleigh Manor\\" in the British sitcom television series To the Manor Born, broadcast from 1979 to 1981 and written by Peter Spence whose father-in-law was then the owner of the house. Despite the closeness depicted on screen, the Manor and Lodge are in fact about one mile (1.6 km) apart. The Lodge was given additional features such as gateposts to give the impression it was a gatehouse, following various previous alterations. The house was again used as \\"Grantleigh Manor\\" in a 25th anniversary special of To The Manor Born shown in 2007. =Heritage At Risk Register= In 2009 the estate was added to English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register due to pressure from the development of the hotel and leisure facilities. Its vulnerability is now classed as 'Medium'.http://www.english- heritage.org.uk/publications/har-2013-registers/sw-HAR-register-2013.pdf retrieved 21 January 2013 Some parts of the grounds have been restored through Natural England's Environmental Stewardship Scheme. =Wildlife park= Wildlife Park at Cricket St Thomas The former deer park of the house, known as \\"Cricket Park\\", were designed by D.D (David) Davis, a noted horticulturist at the start of the 19th Century, and were later turned into a wildlife park. the wildlife park was home to 600 rare and endangered species including lemurs, primates, camels, reptiles and wildfowl. Questions were raised in the UK parliament in 1995 after a rare Asian elephant was euthanised at the park. The wildlife park closed in 2009 and most of the larger animals were moved to other zoos around the country. Some of the smaller animals, such as the lemurs, were kept and the park was returned to gardens and lakes, re-opening in mid-2010.http://www.warnerleisurehotels.co.uk/hotels/cricket-st-thomas- hotel/lakes-and-gardens/index.aspx The park has since closed again and very little remains of the enclosures or buildings. =Crinkley Bottom theme park= In 1994 the grounds also became home to Crinkley Bottom, a theme park created by the broadcaster Noel Edmonds themed on the \\"Mr Blobby\\" character from his hit BBC television series Noel's House Party. The project was short- lived and closed within four years, shortly after Noel's House Party went off air. when the grounds reverted to their previous use. Mr Blobby's house, named 'Dunblobbin' was situated at the rear of the park. Other attractions at the park included a TV-themed dark ride and a walkthrough exhibit of Noddy's Toyland Adventures. Remains of the house and its 'blobbyland' theme park could still be seen until 2014, overgrown and strewn with fallen leaves and mud. Mr Blobby's house was demolished late 2014.

The explosions occurred around midday at Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street and Oval stations on the London Underground, and on London Buses route 26 in Bethnal Green on Hackney Road. A fifth bomber dumped his device without attempting to set it off. Connecting lines and stations were closed and evacuated. Metropolitan Police later said the intention was to cause large-scale loss of life, but only the detonators of the bombs exploded, probably causing the popping sounds reported by witnesses, and only one minor injury was reported. The suspects fled the scenes after their bombs failed to explode. On Friday 22 July, CCTV images of four suspects wanted in connection with the bombings were released. Two of the men shown in these images were identified by police on Monday 25 July as Muktar Said Ibrahim and Yasin Hassan Omar. The resultant manhunt was described by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair as \\"the greatest operational challenge ever faced\\" by the Met. During the manhunt, police misidentified Jean Charles de Menezes as one of the suspected bombers and shot and killed him. By 29 July, police had arrested all four of the main bombing suspects from 21 July attempted bombings. Yasin Hassan Omar was arrested by police on 27 July, in Birmingham. On 29 July, two more suspects were arrested in London. A fourth suspect, Osman Hussein, was arrested in Rome, Italy, and later extradited to the UK. Police also arrested numerous other people in the course of their investigations. On 9 July 2007, four defendants, Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29, Yasin Hassan Omar, 26, Ramzi Mohammed, 25, and Hussain Osman, 28, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder. The four attempted bombers were each sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 40 years' imprisonment.  Explosions = Explosions on the underground = * 12:26 BST ‚Äì An explosion occurred on a train at Shepherd's Bush tube station on the Hammersmith & City line in West London. * 12:30 BST ‚Äì An explosion occurred on a train at Oval Underground station on the Northern line. * 12:45 BST ‚Äì An explosion occurred on a Victoria line train at Warren Street Underground station (through which the Northern line also runs). In each case, only the detonator caps fired and the bombs themselves did not go off; this may have been due to the low quality hydrogen peroxide used in the devices, which had been obtained from a large number of easily available sources. The explosions were small‚Äîonly about as powerful as a large firework‚Äîand no injuries were reported, although a person who suffered an asthma attack was counted as the incident's sole injury. In response to the blasts, the stations were all evacuated and other stations including Archway in North London, Moorgate, St. Paul's in the City and Green Park in the West End were also cleared. Many parts of the London Underground system including the Victoria line, Northern line, Hammersmith and City Line, Bakerloo line and Piccadilly line were suspended. Some eyewitnesses reported a \\"strange smell\\", described by some as resembling burning rubber, emanating from the Underground stations. Some early reports seem to be suggesting that the smell preceded the bang by several minutes. It appears that people on a train smelt a strange odour, and realised something was wrong. They ran from one carriage to another while the train was still moving and then heard an explosion behind them. Eyewitnesses at the scenes reported seeing men running away from the site of the explosions, and there were unconfirmed suggestions that one of the bombers had been injured. = Explosion on a double-decker bus = * 13:30 BST ‚Äì A small explosion occurred in east London on the Number 26 bus travelling from Waterloo to Hackney Wick, on Hackney Road at the corner with Columbia Road in Bethnal Green. There were no fatalities in the explosion. The vehicle involved was Stagecoach London Dennis Trident 2 (17762, LX03 BUU), identical in type to the bus destroyed on 7/7, and based at the same depot; Stratford (SD). = Early suspicion of chemical attacks = It was reported that one of the 7 July suspects, Jamal (Germaine) Lindsay, had bought ¬£900 worth of perfumes immediately before the bombings, possibly to disguise the acrid smell of the decomposing explosives. Some witnesses reported seeing a white powder: TATP is a white crystalline powder. An eyewitness mentioned that as one of the explosions occurred there was a \\"smell of vinegar\\" which could be attributed to combustion byproducts of the explosive TATP.Mark Prigg, \\"Tiny errors that stopped another major slaughter\\", London Evening Standard, 22 July 2005.  Subsequent incidents = University College Hospital (UCH) = University College Hospital, near Warren Street, was cordoned off at 14:30 BST, reportedly by armed police. Eyewitnesses reported seeing three armed police officers entering the building. Both CNN and The Times reported that the armed police at University College Hospital were pursuing a suspected bomber who fled into the building following a chase on foot down Tottenham Court Road. Witnesses reported shots being fired as the man led police on the chase from Warren Street Underground station. Police say the \\"gunshots\\" may have actually been detonators going off. An internal memo at the hospital told employees to look for a tall man with wires protruding from his clothing. The memo reportedly described the suspect as \\"a black male, possibly of Asian origin, about 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) tall, wearing a blue top with wires protruding from the rear of the top.\\" The BBC spoke to Prof Jim Ryan of UCH, who said he had not seen any such memo and dismissed the idea as \\"absolute rumour.\\" A BBC reporter, however, said that he had been given a copy of an email sent to staff asking them to look for the suspect. Later in the afternoon police said they had ended their armed operation at the hospital, but returned 30 minutes later. A Scotland Yard spokesman told the BBC: \\"We've got our armed deployment at UCH but we can't discuss it further.\\"BBC NEWS  UK  Police search hospital near Tube There were conflicting reports on whether the redeployment was related to the bombings. CNN reported that sources told them police had returned to conduct a manhunt inside the building, but police said the deployment was unrelated to the explosions. = The first arrests = At 15:30, around two hours after the explosions, a major security alert occurred in Whitehall outside the Ministry of Defence during which a man was arrested by armed police. The man was ordered to lie on the pavement before being handcuffed and arrested, about 20 metres from Downing Street. He was also ordered to open his jacket and shirt before being taken by the police, presumably to allow police to see any hidden explosives that may have been on his person. He did not appear to be carrying any bags, and did not seem to be wearing a belt, although it was very hard for the reporter to see. The BBC reported (and television coverage showed) that he was wearing a small black backpack which the police had him remove before undoing his shirt. Two other people were also arrested: one in the Whitehall area, and one near Tottenham Court Road, according to the BBC. But all were later released without any charges being brought against them. According to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, the two arrests in Whitehall were \\"totally unconnected\\" to the earlier explosions. = Other security alerts = A security alert was declared, mid-afternoon, at St Albans railway station, north of London. The station was closed and the surrounding area evacuated following the discovery of an unattended backpack. A number 37 bus (Putney to Peckham) was also cordoned off after a suspect package was discovered. These incidents are both believed to be bomb scares. = 22 July = Death of Jean Charles de Menezes  Police shot and killed a Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, at Stockwell Underground station shortly after 10:00 on 22 July. Officers had pursued de Menezes from a location under surveillance, believing him to be one of the men wanted for the attacks of the previous day. They apparently believed de Menezes, who was claimed to be wearing a heavy jacket ‚Äì later shown to be an ordinary denim jacket ‚Äì was a possible suicide bomber. Police later confirmed he was not related to the bombing incidents and issued an apology, saying that \\"For somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the Metropolitan Police Service regrets.\\" Services on the Victoria line between Victoria and Brixton and on the Northern line between Kennington and Morden were suspended at the request of the police.BBC News (rolling coverage))  Security alerts  Sky and BBC News reported that the East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road in Whitechapel had been surrounded by armed police and that residents were told to stay indoors. The mosque was evacuated at about 10:30 and searched. However, police confirmed that it was a bomb scare and the all-clear was given after just over an hour. Security alerts continued into the weekend, with major disruption to London's transport system. = 23 July = A fifth bomb  On 23 July, a suspect package was found in bushes in Little Wormwood Scrubs, just north of White City and Shepherd's Bush. It was subjected to a controlled explosion and appears to have been a further bomb made to the same design as the others used on 21 July. This led to speculation that a fifth bomber might be at large. Scotland Yard stated that they were looking for more than just the four men caught on CCTV, and by 29 July five suspected bombers had been arrested. Like other devices used on 21 July, the device was packed into a six-and-a-quarter-litre clear plastic food container with a white lid, manufactured by Delta of India, sold in about 100 outlets across the UK. The police made an appeal to retailers who may have sold five or more in the time period.  Investigation  It was immediately apparent that the explosions were the result of an attempted terrorist attack, but it was initially unclear whether the explosions were a serious attempt to repeat 7 July bombings or were merely a symbolic attack or hoax intended to cause panic rather than mass casualties. The explosives used by the bombers consisted of Chapatti flour powder mixed with liquid hydrogen peroxide, detonated by a booster charge. This was not the same explosive mixture used by the bombers in the 7/7 bombings two weeks earlier, which had used TATP. It was later confirmed that substantial improvised explosive devices capable of causing significant numbers of casualties had in fact been involved, but had failed to explode. The explosions were caused by detonators which failed to detonate the main explosive charge. Police later disclosed that some of the devices used had survived the explosions and were available for forensic investigation. = In relation to the 7 July bombings = Both sets of bombings involved three Underground trains and a bus; in both cases, rucksacks were involved; and in both cases, the three Underground explosions were roughly simultaneous while the bus explosion was an hour later. Moreover, in both cases, the four explosion locations were dispersed around central London in such a way that they could be reasonably said to have occurred \\"in the north, south, east, and west,\\" recalling the wording of several Islamist manifestos. It was later reported that three of the four devices were of similar size and weight to those used on 7 July, with the fourth being housed in a smaller plastic box; all were said to have used the same type of explosive.BBC NEWS  UK  Urgent hunt for London attackers = Claims of responsibility = Late Thursday night, a group calling itself the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade, after a nickname for one of Osama bin Laden's lieutenants who was killed in a 2001 airstrike in Afghanistan, posted a statement claiming responsibility for the attempted bombings. The group vowed that the terror would continue as long as Europe's soldiers were in Iraq. The group also claimed responsibility for the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the 2003 North America blackout. Experts doubt the legitimacy of the group, as security experts have discredited the claims of the Madrid attack, and investigators have ruled out sabotage as a cause of the blackout. In its statement, the group cited Rome, Amsterdam and Copenhagen as future targets. However, the group has made threats in the past that it has failed to carry out. The group has also previously falsely claimed responsibility for events that were the result of technical problems, such as the 2003 London blackout and Northeast Blackout of 2003. = Suspects and later arrests = Several individuals were reported to have been arrested on 22 July in connection with the bombings, including one man in Stockwell‚Äîthe area where the shooting incident took place‚Äîand another man at a Snow Hill railway station in the city of Birmingham who was soon released without charge. The former may be among the individuals seen running away from the scenes of the incidents who were caught on CCTV footage. Police released images of people they wished to question with regards to the attempted bombings captured from London transport CCTV cameras. On 25 July, two of the suspects were named by police as Yasin Hassan Omar and Muktar Said Ibrahim (also known as Muktar Mohammed Said). Yasin Hassan Omar is suspected of trying to detonate the device at Warren Street tube station and Muktar Said Ibrahim is suspected of trying to detonate the device on the bus. The Home Office has stated that both men have legally been residents for at least ten years. On Wednesday 27 July, police arrested Omar in Birmingham. A suspect package was found in the course of his arrest. Three further arrests were also made in Birmingham. This raid was raised because the caretaker of the area found around 10 large bottles of hair dye, which can be used in explosives, and he was suspicious so called a low level police contact. Major police raids occurred in west London on 29 July. It has been reported that a further two of the pictured suspects, Muktar Said Ibrahim and Ramzi Mohammed, were arrested in the course of these raids, while the Shepherd's Bush suspect ‚Äì Osman Hussain ‚Äì was arrested in Rome that day. The men arrested in London were apparently the suspects wanted in connection with the Oval tube and bus bombing attempts, and the man arrested in Rome is the Shepherd's Bush suspect. A European Arrest Warrant for Osman Hussain was issued by the Metropolitan Police, and he was extradited to the UK where he was charged on 8 December 2005. In addition the suspected fifth bomber Whabi Mohammad, 22, the brother of Ramzi Mohammad, was also under arrest by 28 July. = Charges = On 7 August 2005, Yasin Hassan Omar, Muktar Said Ibrahim, and Ramzi Mohammed were charged with attempting to murder passengers and being in possession of an explosive substance. Along with a fourth man, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, they were also charged with conspiring to murder passengers. (See the article on Osman Hussain for the charges laid against him on 8 December 2005 and other information.) On 26 February 2008, a Tanzanian-born Muslim man who dubbed himself \\"Osama bin London\\" was found guilty of encouraging his followers to murder non-believers and of running violent Islamist training camps in Britain. Mohammed Hamid, 50, who came to England when he was five, was convicted along with three followers ‚Äì Kibley da Costa, 25, Mohammed al- Figari, 45, and Kader Ahmed, 20 ‚Äì whom the jury found guilty of attending the training camps. A fifth suspect, Atilla Ahmet, 43, who once boasted of being Al Qaeda's top figure in Europe, admitted three charges of soliciting murder at the start of the complex four-month trial at Woolwich Crown Court. The trial was closely watched in Britain as Hamid was accused of providing the inspiration for the men who tried to carry out suicide bombings on London's transport system on 21 July 2005. = Trial = Muktar Said Ibrahim, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, Hussein Osman, Yasin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Adel Yahya began trial in relation to the attacks of 21 July 2005 at Woolwich Crown Court on 15 January 2007. The case was anticipated to last for 'up to four months,' but in fact the jury only retired to consider the verdict on 28 June 5¬Ω months later. On 9 July 2007, the jury found Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yasin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed, and Hussain Osman guilty of conspiracy to murder. In November 2007, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu admitted conspiracy to cause explosions while a charge of conspiracy to murder was dropped. Adel Yahya pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.Man admits 21 July bombing charge, BBC = Appeals = In April 2008 the Court of Appeal judges dismissed a challenge by Ibrahim, Omar, Mohammed and Osman to their convictions. December 2014 an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights lodged in 2008 by Ibrahim, Omar and Mohammed claiming that their rights were breached in the 'safety interviews' after their arrests was rejected. = House raids = In the afternoon of 22 July, house raids were conducted on Harrow Road in West London (approximately a mile from Paddington railway station). The road was cordoned off by armed police and some eyewitnesses reported seeing a bomb-disabling robot. On 25 July police announced that they had raided a property in north London. The property was a council flat in Curtis House, Ladderswood Way, New Southgate in which Yasin Hassan Omar had been living since 1999. No arrests were made in the raid although two men have been arrested in the area. Later reports suggested that explosives may have been found at the raided address. The BBC has a summary of raids to date. Major raids were carried out by the police on 29 July in the Notting Hill and North Kensington areas of West London. Three people were arrested during these raids, including two of the suspects who were thought to have carried out the failed bombing attempt. (see Wikinews article). = Seized vehicles = On 26 July it was reported that police had seized a vehicle abandoned in East Finchley, north London. The BBC reported that the vehicle was a white VW Golf which was not owned by any of the suspects but which was thought to have been used by them. = Individuals charged or held by police = As of 8 August 2005 the following people had been charged in relation to 21 July or 7 July bombing attempts: * Charged with association with the aim of international terrorism and with possessing false documents in Italy: ** Osman Hussein, found guilty at Woolwich Crown Court of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 40 years in prison. * Charged with association with the aim of international terrorism: ** Yasin Hassan Omar, arrested 27 July in Birmingham, charged 7 August, found guilty of conspiracy to murder 9 July 2007. ** Ramzi Mohammed, charged 7 August, found guilty of conspiracy to murder 9 July 2007. ** Muktar Said Ibrahim, charged 7 August, found guilty of conspiracy to murder 9 July 2007. * Charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life or cause serious injury: ** Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, charged 7 August, remanded in custody until 14 November. * Charged with failing to disclose information that may help police investigating an act of terrorism: ** Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Shadi Sami Abdel Gadir, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Omar Nagmeloin Almagboul, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Mohamed Kabashi, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Yeshshiemebet Girma, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Muluemebet Girma, remanded in custody until 11 August. * Charged with failing to disclose information about suspected Shepherd's Bush bomber Hussain Osman: ** Ismael Abdurahman, remanded in custody until 11 August. * Charged with assisting a person or persons in evading arrest: ** Asias Girma, remanded in custody until 11 August. ** Whabi Mohammed, remanded in custody until 11 August.

I never thought of killing people.\\" He claimed that the bombs were never meant to detonate or kill anybody, only to draw attention to the Iraq war. Other news sources reported that the bombers watched videos of women and children killed in Iraq by British and American troops before embarking on their mission.'Confession' lifts lid on London bomb plot, The Scotsman, 31 July 2005 Some quoted him as saying \\"Muktar showed us some DVDs with images of the war in Iraq, especially women and children killed by American and British soldiers,\\" Hussain said, adding that they were not to talk about these videos with others. \\"There was a feeling of hatred and conviction that it was necessary to give signal‚Äîto do something.\\" Hussain denied links with either the Al-Qaeda or the 7 July bombers.  Response and advice =Immediate response= Prime Minister Tony Blair, Home Secretary Charles Clarke, and other ministers and key officials from government and the emergency services attended a meeting in COBR. Blair interrupted a meeting with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard to attend a COBR meeting, although he and Howard later gave a joint news conference in response to the attacks on both the London Underground and Bethnal Green (Howard was also in Washington, D.C., at the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks.) Whitehall, the main artery serving the governmental district, was initially sealed off and evacuated, but was reopened at 14:45. It was subsequently closed again around 15:25 following an arrest and a bomb scare, both of which were fairly quickly resolved. Sir Ian Blair, the Met police chief, described the incident as \\"serious\\" but said that there were \\"fewer injuries\\", caused by bombs that appeared to be \\"much smaller than those used on 7 July\\". The police advised people to stay where they were and not travel unless absolutely necessary. However, people living within a 300 metre radius of the bomb sites were evacuated, due to worries about chemical agents being used. By about 16:00, however, Sir Ian Blair described the situation as \\"firmly under control\\" and urged London \\"to get ... moving again\\". According to the Evening Standard, stranded commuters and evacuated locals in Shepherd's Bush held an impromptu street party during the evening of 21 July, in the vicinity of the crime scene, which lasted until the early morning. Music was provided by a peace activism group, and several photographs of this appeared in London's local press the following day. =International reaction= Australian Prime Minister John Howard condemned the attack on the London Underground and Bethnal Green stated that Australia stood by Britain and that people should \\"beware the minds of terrorists\\" during a press conference with Tony Blair. The United States Department of State informed President George W. Bush of the attacks and The Pentagon raised its security level in response to the incidents in central London and Bethnal Green. In addition, New York City Police Commissioner, Raymond Kelly announced that they would begin randomly searching backpacks on the New York City Subway system, though they have said that this move had been under consideration before the events in London.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/today20050721-2 China Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao has said that \\"China thoughts are with the peoples of London\\" by this tragedy and once again \\"condemned\\" any terrorist attacks targeted at civilians.

Indeed, [he is] ... an original voice celebrating music.\\" Early life and musical education Jeremy Joseph Beck was born January 15, 1960, in Painesville, Ohio. His father, Albert William Beck (b. April 4, 1931, in Scranton, Pennsylvania; d. May 16, 2018 in Quincy, Illinois), known as \\"Al\\", was a visual artist and poet who taught for many years at Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri. His mother, Mila Katrine Aho (b. June 24, 1935, Painesville, Ohio; d. March 26, 2018 in Memphis, Tennessee), known as \\"Katrine\\", was a pianist and organist who taught music privately. Beck's parents married in 1958, but not without some controversy: the Beck family was Jewish and the Aho family was Lutheran. Albert's parents agreed to support the wedding as long as the Ahos knew they were Jewish. Katrine's parents agreed to support the wedding only if Katrine's father ‚Äì Gustav Axel Aho, also known as \\"G.A. Aho\\", a Lutheran minister ‚Äì performed the ceremony in his own church. Under those conditions, the nuptials took place. The family lived briefly in and around Cleveland, Ohio, before moving to Kansas City for a year, 1967‚Äì68, where Al served as Dean of Students at the Kansas City Art Institute. The family then settled in Quincy, Illinois. Beck's parents were divorced in 1977. Beck's earliest musical studies were with his mother; he then began playing the cello in the 4th grade in Quincy. While in high school, Beck studied music composition and theory privately with Thom Ritter George, an Eastman graduate and conductor of the Quincy Symphony Orchestra. Following his graduation from high school in 1978, Beck moved to New York City, earning a B.S. in Composition from the Mannes College of Music where he studied with David Loeb. He later earned a master's degree in composition from Duke University where he studied with Stephen Jaffe and Thomas Oboe Lee. Following his studies at Duke, Beck completed a second master's degree and a doctoral degree in composition at the Yale School of Music, studying with Jacob Druckman, Martin Bresnick, Lukas Foss, and Allen Forte. Working life After graduating from Yale, Beck taught music composition and theory at the University of Northern Iowa, earning tenured there in 1998. Beck took a leave of absence from UNI to teach for a year at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, instead of returning to Iowa, in 1999, Beck accepted a position as an associate professor of music composition and theory at California State University, Fullerton, where he also earned tenure, in 2002. During his teaching years, Beck was invited to teach and lecture on American music, music theory, and composition around the world, including in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Ghana. In 2002, Beck accepted a short-term teaching position at the University of Louisville. Following a change in the administration and the loss of his position, Beck decided to pursue a J.D. degree, graduating from the university's Brandeis School of Law in 2007. In addition to his continuing work in composition, now Beck is also a practicing attorney in Louisville, Kentucky. He blends his music background into his entertainment law practice, with an emphasis on copyright, trademark, and contracts. Recordings=by moonlight= Beck has released six CDs of his music on the innova label. About Beck's most recent release, the music critic Jean-Yves Duperron observes that \\"...American composer Jeremy Beck ‚Ä¶ seems to attach a distinctively individual compositional technique to each and every different instrument or group of instrumental or vocal forces he writes for. ...[H]ighlights for me are the Echoes of a Young Poet's Dream from Dream and Echoes, performed impeccably here by the vocal ensemble The First Readings Project. It's harmonically rich dissonances pull you into a dark fog that magically lifts once you hear the goosebump-inducing final chord. Also admirable are his orchestration skills made apparent in the Three Pieces for Orchestra in which different threads manifest themselves simultaneously and request your attention.\\" Another review declared that Beck's compositions are \\"Luminous, expressive, and refined [and that these] are some of the words that come to mind as the album's tonal pieces play, \\"by moonlight\\" deftly showing Beck cultivating an individual voice while operating within a tradition.\\" =String Quartets= The critic Donald Rosenberg describes the music on Beck's CD, String Quartets (2013), as \\"forceful and expressive ‚Ä¶ concise in structure and generous in tonal language, savouring both the dramatic and the poetic,\\" while Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle states Beck's music is \\"appealing and skillfully crafted ‚Ä¶ [with] lush tonal harmonies.\\" Kosman further observes that \\"novelty isn't the only thing music can provide, and the moody expressiveness of Beck's writing is its own reward.\\" =IonSound Project= Beck's 2011 CD, IonSound Project, features the ensemble-in- residence at the University of Pittsburgh. His music on this recording has been described as \\"uplifting, buoyant and ... emotional and sensitive to both the performer and the listener.\\" In addition, critic Andrew Sigler finds Beck's music \\"rhythmically intricate, and makes nods to the past while sitting squarely in the present. ‚Ä¶ Though architecturally rigorous, Beck writes clearly and without pretense[.]\\" =Never Final, Never Gone= Beck's third innova CD, Never Final, Never Gone (2008), features a variety of chamber and vocal music. =pause and feel and hark= His second CD, pause and feel and hark, released in May 2006, includes Black Water, a monodrama based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Black Water received its Australian concert premiere at the 2012 Adelaide Fringe Festival. The stage premiere of this monodrama was produced by the Center for Contemporary Opera at Symphony Space on April 29, 2016 in New York City. =Wave= In 2004, Wave ‚Äì a Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra CD devoted to Beck's music ‚Äì was released on the Innova label. This recording includes his four-movement Sinfonietta for string orchestra, \\"a harmonically inventive, thoroughly engaging work.\\" The disc also includes his operatic soliloquy, Death of a Little Girl With Doves, for soprano and orchestra. This \\"deeply attractive\\" composition is based on the life and letters of the sculptor Camille Claudel. The recording of this major work was heralded for its \\"imperious melodic confidence, fluent emotional command and yielding tenderness.\\" Opera Beck's short comic opera, Review, with a libretto by Patricia Marx, was one of three finalists in the 2010 National Opera Association's New Chamber Opera Competition. It was performed by Oberlin Opera Theater in February, 2014, and twice by Peabody Opera: in October, 2011 in Baltimore, and in Richmond, Virginia, at the College Music Society's annual convention. Review was previously included in the 2009 Opera America and Houston Grand Opera New Works Sampler. Following that successful showcase, Review was then produced by the Moores Opera Center at the University of Houston and later was given its New York premiere by the Center for Contemporary Opera. Beck's opera The Biddle Boys and Mrs. Soffel was named by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as one of the Top Ten Cultural Events in Pittsburgh for the year 2001. With a libretto by the composer based on a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, his monodrama Black Water received its stage premiere on April 29, 2016. Produced by the Center for Contemporary Opera, the sold-out production at Symphony Space's Thalia Theater in New York City featured Laura Bohn, soprano, and Isabella Dawis, piano, with music direction by Lidiya Yankovskaya and stage direction by Eugenia Arsenis.

In 1976, in the context of rapproachment from the side of the government, Diop was welcomed to return from exile. Rapidly he gathered his followers and formed a 'Provisional Committee for Renewal of PAI'. Amongst his aides were Baba Ndiaye and Bara Goudiaby.

Generally it became known as PAI-R√©novation (Renewal), distinguishing it from the original PAI (which was called PAI-S√©n√©gal).  Background  In an attempt to move away from the one-party system, the National Assembly of Senegal adopted a law on July 9, 1975, which would give way to a three party system. The law identified that three distinct ideological tendencies would be represented in the political life of the country: liberal and democratic, socialist and democratic and Marxist- Leninist. The governing UPS was accorded the role as the Social Democratic party and the main opposition PDS was legalized to take the role as the liberal democratic party. On August 14, 1976 PAI-R√©novation was registered as a legal political party under the name 'PAI'. It was recognized to take the role of the legal left in the three party system.

The town is south of the state capital Sydney and is the most southerly town in New South Wales, located between Nullica Bay to the south and Calle Calle Bay, the northern reach of Twofold Bay,Guide to Twofold Bay cruisesEden Tourist Guide and built on undulating land adjacent to the third- deepest natural harbour in the southern hemisphere, and Snug Cove on its western boundary. At the , Eden had a population of 3,151. The eastern coastline has rugged cliffs at the southern end and a wide, sandy surf beach, Aslings Beach, north of the cliffs. The beach ends at the entrance to Lake Curalo, a safe boating inlet of Twofold Bay. Although the urban settlement of Eden commenced in 1843 the settlement was not officially proclaimed as a township until 20 March 1885.New South Wales Government Gazette - but need to cite year and volume for this to be a useful reference The town's main industries include fishing, forestry, and tourism. History The local Aboriginal people who lived in the region prior to the arrival of Europeans were the Thaua, or Thawa, people of the Yuin nation. Whaling ships had been operating in the area in 1791. George Bass first took shelter in Twofold Bay on the return leg of a voyage to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in February 1798, having noted the bay on the southward leg of this same voyage in December 1797. Later, in September of that year, on a subsequent voyage with Matthew Flinders, he and Flinders surveyed the bay for the first time. They also made first contact with the local Thawa Aboriginal people on this occasion. The Australian botanist, Allan Cunningham, landed at Snug Cove in December 1817 so that he could collect botanical specimens from the district. The first whaling station, for shore whaling, was established in the area by John Raine in 1828. Local Aboriginal people were employed in the whaling industry. In 1834 the Imlay brothers, Alexander, George and Peter, set up a whaling station at Snug Cove. Nearby they built a small slab and bark hut, the first-known building erected at Eden. Sketches of the hut were made by Sir Oswald Brierly in 1842 and by Captain Owen Stanley from HMS Rattlesnake in 1843. In around 1860 Davidson commenced a partnership with the Solomon family of Eden-Monaro. Initially the prevalent orcas were seen by the partnership as a nuisance. But the boat crews employed, Yuin aboriginals, refused to kill orcas, and a new policy encouraged collaboration between whalers and the killer whales; the killer whales would trap humpback whales that entered Twofold Bay, the whales would then be harpooned, and the orcas rewarded with prize pieces of the humpback carcasses.http://www.jewishhistoryaustralia.net/Nulla_Nulla_Story/A_5_Killers_in_Eden.htm Article with further references The graziers from the Monaro district inland from Twofold Bay were seeking a better way to transport their cattle to Hobart, Tasmania. It was decided to establish cattle-handling facilities and an accompanying township on an appropriate site on Twofold Bay. Thus, in 1834, the Home Government authorised the captain of HMS Alligator to seek an appropriate site for a settlement on Twofold Bay.The Australian 3 June 1834 Early in 1835 the Governor of New South Wales, Governor Richard Bourke, visited Twofold Bay and the site of the proposed new settlement on board HMS Hyacinth.Australian 13 February 1835, 13 March 1835 Eventually the area for the proposed town, to be called Eden, was surveyed in 1842 by Mr Thomas Townsend, the Government Surveyor. The main street, Imlay Street, was named after the Imlay brothers who were early pioneers to the district. Other streets were named after Lieutenant Flinders, George Bass, Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert. A wharf was built out into a cove, now named Cattle Bay, from a site on the western edge of Eden, where cattle could be grazed prior to their being loaded onto the ships. Cattle were also grazed on Lookout Point until 1853, then this land was subdivided for housing. Eden was named after George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland, the British Secretary for the Colonies, Baron Auckland, whose family name was Eden. After the town plan was finalised the first blocks were auctioned on 9 March 1843. The land was sold to Thomas Aspinall, Benjamin Boyd, S. Clinton, Lewes Gordon, W. Hirst, James Kirwan, J.P. Robinson and T.A. Townsend. The first postmaster was appointed in 1843 but the first post office did not open until 1847. The Customs House was built in Eden in 1848. Earlier the first customs officer was appointed in 1846 but he was located at East Boyd initially, until the customs house was constructed. Eden grew in the 1850s following the decline of nearby Boydtown, and the discovery of gold in Kiandra, which led to the 1859‚Äì1860 gold rush. For a few hectic months hundreds of gold seekers landed at Eden, replenished their supplies then headed for Kiandra. With the winter snow falls at Kiandra came the hurried exodus of those same people keen to leave the district as soon as possible. For a short period Eden flourished, only to quickly return to its usual quiet pace again. In the 1850s there were four hotels in Eden. One of these hotels, the Crown and Anchor first licensed in 1845, still stands. It is no longer licensed but it still provides accommodation to travellers. Just south of this building is another built in 1850 as a commercial premises. Various businesses occupied the site. The building is now used as a private dwelling. The first government school started in 1857. The school attached to St Joseph's Roman Catholic church commenced in 1888. There were also several private tutors in Eden. The shipping of cattle from Eden ceased in the late 1890s. Prior to that the business had expanded to include the shipping of cattle to South Australia, Queensland and to New Zealand. Because Eden is equidistant between Sydney and both Melbourne and Tasmania, the port town was considered as a location for the Australian capital following Australian Federation in 1901. However, the ‚ÄòLimestone Plains‚Äô in southern New South Wales were chosen instead as the location of the new city of Canberra. Whaling declined in the 1920s and ended in 1930. Court house built under the Colonial Architect, Alexander Dawson in 1858 Lake Curaldo at dusk Catholic Church Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,151 people in Eden. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.2% of the population. * 79.1% of people were born in Australia and 88.0% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 31.6%, Anglican 24.9% and Catholic 18.9%. Government From its inception Eden was located in the County of Auckland, named earlier after the Earl of Auckland from whom Eden also took its name. However, the County of Auckland was not considered to be within the bounds of the Colony of New South Wales until many years after the settlement of Eden commenced. The town of Eden lies within the Bega Valley Shire local government area. It is within the federal electorate of Eden-Monaro, which has for a long time been a key marginal seat, resulting in significant focus by the media and political parties during election campaigns. It is represented in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly by the electorate of Bega. Industry Horse-racing commenced in Eden in the mid-1850s and continued until the mid-1920s. The racecourse was located on the northern bank of Lake Curalo. A number of industries are based in the town in the mid-2000s. These are mainly related to the tourist industry and include a wide variety of accommodation, places to eat and entertainment, especially fishing and sailing. As well, cruises of Twofold Bay and for whale-watching leave the Eden Wharf located in Snug Cove. The cruise of Nullica Bay, Twofold Bay, allows close views of the two major wharves mentioned in the article on Twofold Bay. Tourism contributes AU$180 million yearly to the economy of the shire, which includes Bega and several other towns. The area receives 550,000 visitors annually. Many people visit Eden for whale watching as whales migrate from Antarctic to tropical waters in June and July, and back again later in the year. A significant fishing fleet is based in the harbour (Snug Cove). A tuna cannery opened in the town in 1949. It was closed in 1999, at the cost of many jobs. Sawmilling of timber has also been an important local industry for most of the life of the town. For over one hundred years the collection and export of wattle-bark was also a major local industry. Whaling played a very important role in the town's economy for over 100 years before its decline in the area in the 1920s and its end in 1930. [Eden‚Äôs Killer Whale Museum] informs visitors of the history of whaling in the area and the role of orcas (killer whales) led by Old Tom in herding whales into the harbour and helping whalers kill them.

The Port of Eden is the largest fishing port in New South Wales. The major export handled by the port is woodchips. The port is shared with the Department of Defence who have constructed a large wharf for the servicing of their warships. The port also handles cruise ships.

It passed on through the descendants of the Malet family until 1356 when it was sold to Sir Matthew Gourney and his family until 1443 when the estate passed to the king and became part of the Duchy of Cornwall. Curry Mallet was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. The Manor House is a Grade II* listed building, includes a Great Hall (or perhaps a barn) of the 15th century, and a small irregular manor house of the late 16th century. It stands on the site of, and incorporates parts of, the castle built by William Malet, a Norman knight who fought at the Battle of Hastings.The entrance hall extension and other parts were upgraded and connected with the main house c 1939 by Clough Williams- Ellis whose client was the Selous family. The Manor House was lived in by the Pyne family who are buried in an Elizabethan family tomb to be found in the Mallet Chapel in the village Church of St James. Elizabeth II visited the house as part of her duties when she was head of the Duchy of Cornwall. The house is associated with the memory of Derek Jarman, film-maker, artist and gay activist.

He was married to Tjuyu, an Egyptian noblewoman associated with the royal family, who held high offices in the governmental and religious hierarchies. Their daughter, Tiye, became the Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep III. They also may have been the parents of Ay,Rice, p.222 an Egyptian courtier active during the reign of pharaoh Akhenaten, who eventually became pharaoh, as Kheperkheprure Ay. There is no conclusive evidence, however, regarding the kinship of Yuya and Ay, although certainly, both men came from the town of Akhmim.David, Anthony & Rosalie, A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, London: Seaby, 1992. p.167 Yuya and Tjuyu also are known to have had a son named Anen, who carried the titles \\"Chancellor of Lower Egypt\\", \\"Second Prophet of Amun\\",\\"sm-priest of Heliopolis, and \\"Divine Father\\".Rice, p.20 The tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu was, until the discovery of Tutankhamun's, one of the most spectacular ever found in the Valley of the Kings despite Yuya not even being a pharaoh. Although the burial site was robbed in antiquity, many objects not considered worth plundering by the robbers remained. Both the mummies were largely intact and were in an amazing state of preservation. Their faces in particular were relatively undistorted by the process of mummification, and provide an extraordinary insight into the actual appearance of the deceased while alive (see photographs). Origins An elaborate box from Yuya and Tjuyu's tomb bearing Amenhotep III's cartouche. Yuya came from the Upper Egyptian town of Akhmim, where he probably owned an estate and was a wealthy member of the town's local nobility. His origins remain unclear. In his study of Yuya's mummy the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith considered that although his features are not classically Egyptian, he considers that there was much migration from neighbouring countries throughout Egyptian history and \\"it would be rash to offer a final opinion on the subject of Yuaa's nationality.\\" Quibell likewise addressed the \\"old suggestion\\" that Yuya was foreign, noting that the only piece of evidence in favour of this was the multiple spellings of his name. No trace of a foreign origin was found in the furniture from the tomb either, all being typically Egyptian. Taking into account his unusual name and features, some Egyptologists believe that Yuya was of foreign origin, although this is far from certain.David O'Connor & Eric Cline, Amenhotep: Perspectives on his Reign, University of Michigan, 1998, p.5 The name Yuya may be spelled in a number of different ways as Gaston Maspero noted in Theodore Davis's 1907 book‚ÄîThe Tomb of Iouiya and Touiyou.O'Connor & Cline, p.5 These include \\"iAy\\", ywiA\\", yw [reed-leaf with walking feet]A, ywiw\\" and, in orthography‚Äînormally a sign of something foreign‚Äî\\"y[man with hand to mouth]iA\\".Maspero's analysis of Yuya's complex name is given on page xiii-xiv of The Tomb of Iouiya and Touiyou by Theodore M. Davis, Archibald Constable and Co. Ltd, 1907 The Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt suggests that foreign origin. \\"it is conceivable that he had some Mitannian ancestry, since it is known that knowledge of horses and chariotry was introduced into Egypt from the northern lands and Yuya was the king's 'Master of the Horse'.\\" It also discusses the possibility that Yuya was the brother of queen Mutemwiya, who was the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and may have had Mitannian royal origins.Anthony David & Rosalie David, A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, London: Seaby, 1992, p.167 However, this hypothesis can not be substantiated, since nothing is known of Mutemwiya's background. While Yuya lived in Upper Egypt, an area that was predominantly native Egyptian, he could have been an assimilated descendant of Asiatic immigrants or slaves who rose to become a member of the local nobility at Akhmin. If he was not a foreigner, however, then Yuya would have been the native Egyptian whose daughter was married to Amenhotep III. Yuya is believed to have died around 1374 BC in his mid 50s. Career Yuya served as a key adviser for Amenhotep III, and held posts such as \\"King‚Äôs Lieutenant\\" and \\"Master of the Horse\\"; his title \\"Father-of-the- god\\" possibly referred specifically to his being Amenhotep's father-in-law. In his native town of Akhmin, Yuya was a prophet of Min, the chief god of the area, and served as this deity's \\"Superintendent of Cattle\\".David & David, p.167 Tomb The mummy of Yuya Yuya and his wife were buried in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes, where their private KV46 tomb was discovered in 1905Cyril Aldred: Akhenaten, King of Egypt Thames and Hudson, 1989. p.96 by James Quibell, who was working on behalf of Theodore M. Davis. Although the tomb had been penetrated by tomb-robbers, perhaps they were disturbed as Quibell found most of the funerary goods and the two mummies virtually intact. As the Egyptologist Cyril Aldred noted: > Though the tomb had been rifled in antiquity, the [tomb's] opulent funerary > furniture was largely intact, and there was no doubt as to the identity of > the pair, who were found resting among their torn linen wrappings, within > their nests of coffins.Aldred, p.96 The tomb and the burials it contained were the most complete found in the Valley prior to the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Yuya was interred within a rectangular wooden sarcophagus placed against the north wall; its lid was shaped like the vaulted per-nu shrine of Lower Egypt. Though appearing to sit on sledge runners, it had no base so the three nested gilded (and silvered) anthropoid coffins sat flat on the floor. The long south side of the sarcophagus had been broken in by ancient robbers, who had also moved the short eastern side and left the lid askew, balancing precariously. The lids of each of the nested coffins had been removed with two placed atop each other supported by a chair, and one tipped on its side next to the sarcophagus; the troughs were left in place. His gilt cartonnage mask was still in place, although it was broken. =Mummy= The mummy of Yuya was found partially wrapped with only his torso being divested of wrappings by ancient robbers. Despite this disturbance, the thieves had missed the gold plate () covering the embalming incision. When the body of was removed from his innermost coffin, a partially strung necklace composed of large gold and lapis lazuli beads was found behind his neck, where it had presumably fallen after being snapped by looters. The intact wrappings covering his head were removed before the body was shipped to Cairo. Yuya's mummy was first examined by the Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith. He found the body of Yuya is that of an old man, tall, with white wavy hair discoloured by the embalming process; his eyebrows and eyelashes were dark brown. His ears are unpierced. The arms are bent with his hands placed under his chin. The left hand is fisted, while the fingers of the right are extended. A gold finger stall was found on the little finger of the right hand. There were linen embalming packs placed in front of the eyes, and the body cavity was stuffed with resin- treated linen packs. Smith guessed his age at death to be 60 based on outward appearance alone. Modern CT scanning has estimated his age at death to be 50‚Äì60 years, based on the level of joint degeneration and tooth wear. The scanning also revealed two separate levels of resin inside the skull. Packing had been inserted into his mouth, as well as under the skin of his neck to produce a life-like appearance. His cause of death could not be identified. Maspero judged that, based on the position of the sarcophagi, Yuya was the first to die and be interred in the tomb. However, the large eyes and small nose and mouth seen on his funerary mask suggests it was made during the last decade of the reign of Amenhotep III, meaning he may have outlived Tjuyu. Proposed identification with biblical Joseph Journalist Ahmed Osman in his book Stranger in the Valley of the Kings has suggested an identification between Joseph, the ancient Hebrew patriarch who led the tribe of Israel into Egypt during a famine, and Yuya. Osman, Ahmed Stranger in the Valley of the Kings, San Francisco: Harper & Row, (1987) This theory has not been accepted in mainstream Egyptology. Donald B. Redford wrote a scathing review of Stranger in the Valley of the Kings for Biblical Archaeology Review.Redford, Donald B. Review of Stranger in the Valley of the Kings by Ahmed Osman. BAR 15/2 p.8 Similarly, Deborah Sweeney has expressed great doubt toward the proposed identification. Sweeney states that the title \\"God's father of the Lord of the Two Lands\\" is an extension of the title \\"God's Father,\\" which is not exclusive to Yuya. The Bible claims that Joseph's mummified body was exhumed and transported to Canaan by the Israelites, while Yuya's remained undisturbed in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, where his mummy was discovered in 1905.Deborah Sweeney, Review: Osman, \\"Stranger in the Valley of the Kings\\", The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, Vol. 82, No. 3/4 (Jan. - Apr., 1992), pp. 575-579 ReferencesExternal links * * The Treasures of Yuya and Tuyu * Who Was Joseph?

The parish has a population of 2,148. The parish includes the hamlet of Burton Pynsent. History The site of a Roman house has been discovered south of Fairview House. The site is on the Heritage at Risk Register due to ploughing. The unusual name Curry Rivel, comes from the Celtic word , meaning boundary and Rivel from its 12th century landlord Sir Richard Revel. In 1237 the king granted Henry de l'Orti a licence to empark his woods in Curry Rivel separating it from the control of the foresters of Castle Neroche. Curry Rivel was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. Notable structures Burton Pynsent Monument Earnshill House was built in 1725 by John Strachan for Henry Combe, a prominent Bristol merchant. Burton Pynsent House was built around 1756 for William Pitt, after he inherited the estate from Sir William Pynsent, 2nd Baronet. It formed part of a wing on a larger earlier house, that was demolished around 1805. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The grounds were laid out in the mid 18th century by Lancelot Brown and William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, and include early 20th century formal gardens designed by Harold Peto. The Chatham Vase is a stone sculpture commissioned as a memorial to William Pitt the Elder by his wife, Hester, Countess of Chatham. It was originally erected at their house in Burton Pynsent, in 1781, and moved to the grounds of Chevening House in 1934, where it currently resides. The Pynsent Column (also known as the Curry Rivel Column, Burton Pynsent Monument, Pynsent Steeple or Cider Monument) stands on Troy Hill, a spur of high ground about 700 m north-east of the house. It was designed in the 18th century by Capability Brown for William Pitt. It was restored in the 1990s by the John Paul Getty Trust and English Heritage. Midelney Place is a Victorian architecture country house, completed in 1866. GradeII listed and privately owned, it is set in of landscaped grounds.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-264348-midelney-place- walled-forecourt-and-stab? Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. The population of this electoral ward at the 2011 Census was 2,527. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. There is an electoral ward of the same name. The ward extends beyond Curry Rivel to include Midelney. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,527. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Andrew dates from the 13th century and is designated as a Grade I listed building.

The award originated in 1985, and has since 2005 been exclusively a film award (not television). Winners are awarded a trophy by the Norwegian sculptor Kristian Kvakland, and the name--and theme--of the sculpture comes from a legendary local woman from the 1920s. The award ceremony is marked every year by a major, nationally televised, event. History The Amanda Award was instituted in 1985 as part of the Norwegian International Film Festival \\"to increase the quality of and further the interest for Norwegian films\\". The year 1993 marked an exception to the norm, when the so-called \\"Nordic Amanda\\" included contribution from all the Nordic countries. From 2005 onwards, TV- drama was no longer included among the categories honoured, as the TV-specific award \\"Gullruten\\" had taken over this function. Instead the award became exclusively for films. Around the same time another change occurred also. Since the beginning, the award ceremony had been produced in cooperation with the Norwegian state broadcasting corporation Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK). In 2006, however, NRK ended the partnership, and the show has since that time been the responsibility of the private broadcasting company TV 2. In the year 2007, a \\"People's Amanda\\" (\\"Folkets Amanda\\") was awarded for the first time, where the winner was arrived at by popular vote. The first winner of the award was the horror movie Fritt Vilt, directed by Roar Uthaug. Sculpture The name \\"Amanda\\" is derived from a song, or sea shanty, titled \\"Amanda fra [from] Haugesund\\". Supposedly the song in turn refers to a real woman from the 1920s - a single mother who made a living from selling liquor to sailors during the prohibition period. The figurine that is awarded to prize winners originated from a competition held by the local newspaper Haugesunds Avis in 1985, to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda. The competition was won by Kristian Kvakland from Nesodden in Akershus. The full-size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper's office, but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award. The figurine is 30 cm (11.81 in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14 cm (5.51 in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is hollow and weighs 2.5 kg (5.51 lbs), for the first few years it was made of solid metal. Weighing in at 4.5 kg (9.92 lbs) it was difficult to hoist for many winners. It was one of these prizes that, in the year 1986, was won by director Anja Breien, who decided to sell it through a newspaper advert, as a protest against that year's budget cuts for Norwegian film. The Swedish Film Institute, which had experienced similar cuts and sympathized, bought the sculpture. In 2005, as Breien was presented with an honorary award, she was also given back the original sculpture by former Minister of Culture and director of the Swedish Film Institute, √Öse Kleveland. Show The award show has long been a central point of the film festival, as well as a major television event for the whole of Norway. Particularly in earlier years, international stars were sometimes brought in to enhance the prestige of the event. Examples of this are Roger Moore, who was a special guest at the very first ceremony in 1985, and Diana Ross in 1987, then married to Norwegian entrepreneur Arne N√¶ss, Jr. Other international names appearing in the show as presenters have included Ned Beatty, Lauren Bacall, Jon Voight, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan. The show has in recent years been hosted by prominent Norwegian comedians. Jon Almaas, known from the TV- show \\"Nytt p√• nytt\\", played host for several years in the early 2000s. Thomas Giertsen, known as a stand-up comedian and from several TV-shows, has hosted the show in recent years. An episode that received some media attention in 2005 was when host Marit √Öslein and Minister of Culture and Church Affairs from the Christian conservative party KrF, Valgerd Svarstad Haugland, kissed on stage as part of a humorous routine. Awards and winners The only actor ever to have won four Amanda Awards is Bj√∏rn Sundquist. These were awarded for the movies Over grensen (1987), S√∏ndagsengler (1996) and Sejer - se deg ikke tilbake (2000), as well as an Honorary Award in 2000. Also Ane Dahl Torp has won three awards for specific acting roles; she won Best Actress for her roles in Svarte penger - hvite l√∏gner (2004) and Gymnasl√¶rer Pedersen (2006), and was the first ever to receive the newly created award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her effort in L√∏nsj in 2008. Sverre Anker Ousdal has also been named Best Actor twice, for Kreditorene in 1990 and Blodsb√•nd in 1998, and won the Honorary Award in 2009. Nils Ole Oftebro, Espen Skj√∏nberg and Anneke von der Lippe have all been honoured twice each - Oftebro and Skj√∏nberg once as lead actors and once as supporting actors. Among the directors, Ola Solum, Nils Gaup, Berit Nesheim and Bent Hamer have each received two awards.Solum's second win came after the award for best director was created in 2005. Nesheim won once for best children's film as well as once in the \\"Best Film\\" category. Erik Gustavson has the rare distinction of having won in three different categories: for best film and best documentary, in addition to winning the special \\"Nordic Amanda\\" in 1993. This is an accomplishment also Kjersti Holmen can claim, for winning the Best Actress award in 2000, Best Supporting Role in 1993, and the Honorary Award in 2009. The only film to have won the three main awards - best film, best actor and best actress - is Budbringeren in 1997. Actress Liv Ullmann is the Honorary President of the Norwegian International Film Festival, and was awarded the Honorary Amanda in 1992. As of 2010, the categories awarded are: * Best Norwegian Film in Theatrical Release * Best Director (for films in theatrical release) * The People‚Äôs Amanda (audience vote) * Best Actor * Best Actress * Best Actor in a Supporting Role * Best Actress in a Supporting Role * Best Children‚Äôs and Youth Film * Best Original Screenplay * Best Cinematography * Best Sound Design * Best Music * Best Editing * Best Production Design / Scenography * Best Visual Effects * Best Short Film * Best Documentary * The foreign film of the year in Theatrical Release * The Amanda Committee's Golden Clapper (technical award) * The Amanda Committee's Honorary Award ReferencesExternal links * Official site. * Full list of winners. * The Amanda Awards on IMDb. * Statue of the Amanda sculpture outside of Haugesunds Avis.

Tissot's indicatrices of deformation The Hobo‚ÄìDyer map projection is a cylindrical equal-area projection, with standard parallels (there is no north-south or east-west distortion) at 37.5¬∞ north and south of the equator. The map was commissioned in 2002 by Bob Abramms and Howard Bronstein of ODT Inc. and drafted by cartographer Mick Dyer, as a modification of the 1910 Behrmann projection. The name Hobo‚ÄìDyer is derived from Bronstein and Abramms's first names (Howard and Bob) and Dyer's surname. The original ODT map is printed on two sides, one side with north upwards and the other with south upwards. That, together with its equal-area presentation, is intended to present a different perspective compared with more common non- equal area, north-up maps. The goal is similar to that of other equal-area projections (such as the Gall‚ÄìPeters projection), but the Hobo-Dyer is billed by the publisher as \\"more visually satisfying\\". To that end, the map stretches the low latitudes vertically less than Peters, but at the price of greater compression near the poles.

The track is the final song on side two (disc one on CD) of The Beatles and was the last song recorded for the album. In 1976, it was issued as the B-side of the Beatles single \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\". Composition \\"Julia\\" was written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney) in the key of D major and features Lennon on vocals and acoustic guitar. It was written during the Beatles' 1968 visit to Rishikesh in northern India, where they were studying under the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It was here where Lennon learned the song's finger-picking guitar style (known as 'Travis-picking') from the Scottish musician Donovan. Donovan later explained: No other Beatle sings or plays on the song. While Paul McCartney made several \\"solo\\" recordings attributed to the group, dating back to his famous song \\"Yesterday\\", this is the only time that Lennon played and sang unaccompanied on a Beatles track.

But after she split with John's father, John was taken in by his aunt, Mimi, and Julia started a new family with another man; though she lived just a few miles from John, Julia did not spend much time with him for a number of years. Their relationship began to improve as he neared adolescence, though, and in the words of his half-sister, Julia Baird: \\"I lost her twice,\\" Lennon said. \\"Once as a five-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie.

His works have been translated into several languages, titles in English include the novels The Alchemist and Ankor, the Last Prince of Atlantis, as well as The Spirits of Nature and Thebes, two studies on esotericism. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and died in Madrid, Spain. New Acropolis, International Page Livraga was convicted for illegal arm possession in 1988 by Madrid's Provincial Court.Condena de Jorge Livraga. Biography His mother, Victoria Rizzi, and his father, √Ångel Livraga, an industrial engineer, were of Italian origin whose families had emigrated to Argentina in the late 19th century; (Livraga himself would later gain Italian citizenship). Livraga's father died when he was 15, and this led to a spiritual crisis, where, via his English teacher, he eventually came into contact with the Argentine Theosophical Society in the early fifties. He was a member of the Theosophical Society from 1950 to 1962. At some point, he founded the magazine Estudios Teos√≥ficos with Ada Albrecht, and founded New Acropolis, an association intended to promote Philosophy, along the lines of the classical Schools of Philosophy, such as Plato‚Äôs Academy. Livraga began to expand New Acropolis to other Latin American countries: Uruguay, Chile (in 1965), Per√∫, Brasil and Bolivia. Livraga's activities during this period consisted in writing the extensive course manuals. He also had an interest in archeology, regularly organizing private expeditions and maintained a collection housed in a private museum, the Rodrigo Caro Museum. After his death, his natal home in Buenos Aires was converted into a museum in his name. Claims His official New Acropolis biography claims that he was an academic member of the Esoteric group known as the International Philo-Byzantine Academy and University (IPHBAU) that according to the James Randi Foundation gives doctorates in Divinity, and the New Acropolis-related publishing house International Burckhardt Academy in Italy. It also claims that he was a knight of the fictional Real Orden de San Ildefonso y San Atilano, and a recipient of the silver cross from the Soci√©t√© Acad√©mique Arts Sciences Lettres (France), nevertheless apart from his New Acropolis biography no second hand source confirms such claims. His official biography use to list him as archeologist and doctor in philosophy from the inexistent Aztec Academy of Arts, but once such Academy was proven to be fictional the claim was retired. His official biography often claims that he won the Argentine National Poetry Prize with his book Lotuses, however no source of such claim exists outside of New Acropolis and he's not listed as such in any source of the Argentinean government.

Coll. or S.C.) are libraries or library units that house materials requiring specialized security and user services. Materials housed in special collections can be in any format (including rare books, manuscripts, photographs, archives, ephemera, and digital records), and are generally characterized by their artifactual or monetary value, physical format, uniqueness or rarity, and/or an institutional commitment to long-term preservation and access. They can also include association with important figures or institutions in history, culture, politics, sciences, or the arts. Individual libraries or archival institutions determine for themselves what constitute their own special collections, resulting in a somewhat mutable definition. For research libraries, a special collections area or division can be a fundamental part of their mission. Some special collections are standalone institutions that are privately funded, such as the Newberry Library or the American Antiquarian Society while others are part of a larger institution, such as the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Many American university special collections grew out of the merging of rare book rooms and manuscripts departments in a university's library system. In contrast to general (or circulating) libraries, the uniqueness of special collections means that they are not easily replaced (if at all) and therefore require a higher level of security and handling.\\"Research Using Primary Sources: Special Collections,\\" University of Maryland (accessed 5 February 2016). Function The primary function of a special collections division is to foster research by providing researchers access to items while ensuring their longevity. Many staff members involved with special collections have either advanced degrees or specialized training related to the collections for which they are responsible. Storage Items in a special collection are usually stored in closed stacks (not directly accessible to library patrons) which contain noncirculating items, meaning that items cannot be loaned or otherwise removed from the premises. Access to materials is usually under supervision. Depending on the policies of an institution holding special collections, researchers may be asked to present identification cards, letters of reference, or other credentials to gain access. Most special collections are stored in areas in which the temperature, humidity, illumination, and other environmental conditions are carefully monitored to ensure the integrity of materials, and adequate security is provided to protect the materials from unauthorized access, theft, and vandalism. Offsite storage facilities have become increasingly popular among institutions holding special collections. Most libraries consider it their mandate to maintain acquisition of new collections, although the limitations of their physical plants may not be able to handle all that is acquired. Storing materials offsite allows flexibility in how libraries design and apportion their space and provides security for materials. The 2010 \\"Taking Our Pulse\\" report cites a survey in which 67% of responding institutions use offsite facilities, with another 5% in planning stages. Reading room characteristics Special reading rooms are often provided to minimize the risk to holdings while being consulted by patrons, which are sometimes monitored by library personnel who also provide reference assistance and relay requests for materials. Rules often apply to use of materials in order to protect against inadvertent damage; Writing implements which use ink are very commonly prohibited, as well as flash photography, use of mobile phones, and the presence of food and beverages.

The village has a population of 65. History The name Dinnington means the settlement of Dynne's people. The parish was crossed by the Fosse Way and nearby there is evidence of a Roman villa, which was excavated by the archaeological television programme Time Team in 2002 and 2006. The Romano British site has been the site of surface finds of tesserae, roofing slates and pottery. A number of coins have been found and also a small bronze dog. The manor was held at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 by Siward the falconer. The parish of Dinnington was part of the South Petherton Hundred.

The village has a population of 347. The parish includes the hamlet of Peasmarsh. History The village was recorded as Dunnyete meaning Dunna's gate in 725. In the Domesday Book a park at Donyatt was held by Drogo from the Count of Mortain. Donyatt was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. In 1328 it was the birthplace of William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, whose family held the manor and built a castle or fortified manor house. It had a manorial chapel and it is from this that a Sheela na Gig was recovered and is now incorporated into a private house. The almshouses in Church Street date from 1624, and were founded under the will of John Dunster of London (died 1625). Next to them is the old school house, which was built in the early 19th century, and the old school which dates from 1871. The Old clay puddling house, a circular thatched building, is a former pottery dating from the 18th century, when there were also woollen-mills in the village. Thirty-three examples of pottery from Donyatt have been identified from five sites in Virginia and Maryland. They were part of a wider pottery industry during the 17th and 18th centuries. Sites from which were excavated in the 1960s and 1970. The \\"Sea Bridge\\" carries the road over a stream. It was built in the 18th century with three semi-circular arches. The site of Donyatt Halt, between Chard and Ilminster on the B&ER; branch line Donyatt had a small halt along the Chard Branch Line just before Ilminster, which served the local community, it was constructed from sleepers laid horizontally and pegged together to form a basic platform structure, a small over canopy \\"shed\\" served as a shelter during the winter months, access to the platform was gained by crossing over the bridge and accessing an inclined path. The Halt is next to some World War II defences used on the Taunton Stop Line, with anti-tank traps around the station. During the threat of invasion, an inspection post could be quickly set up between Donyatt and Ilminster to stop and check the trains before proceeding on the down line \\"to\\" and \\"from\\" Chard. This was achieved by placing a barrier on some cut out stones entering the Donyatt Halt, you can see these if you wonder why there are two opposite stones on the cycle path, one will have a hole cut into it to act as a pivot for the barrier.

Born in London, England, Griffith-Jones was the youngest of 11 children and daughter of a Welsh barrister. Her brother, John, was father of Mervyn Griffith-Jones, the prosecuting barrister (later judge) involved in the 1960 prosecution of Penguin Books for the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and the 1963 trial of Stephen Ward relating to the Profumo affair. She, along with many women of her time, had no formal qualifications. During World War I, she served as a welfare officer at a munitions factory in Wales, for which she was awarded an MBE. Early years In 1923, Griffith-Jones ‚Äî widely known as ‚ÄúMiss Griff‚Äù ‚Äî came to Singapore to spend a three-month holiday with her brother, Oswald Phillips Griffith-Jones. After her vacation, she chose to stay in Singapore to dedicate her life to the education of expatriate children, founding the Tanglin Day School which later became the Tanglin Preparatory School. When the school first opened in March 1925, it functioned from a disused supper shed within the premises of the Tanglin Club. It began with five students but soon began to grow rapidly. The school served the needs of children up to the age of eight. At the time, many British expatriates living in Singapore had to send their children to Britain to attend boarding school at an early age. This meant being separated from their children for a lengthy period of time. Family portrait c. 1912. Miss Griffith-Jones with her parents and elder sister Nettie. \\"Miss Griff\\" is standing second from left. Photo credit: Tanglin Trust School. Griffith-Jones saw the need to provide a British-style education in Singapore so that parents could postpone boarding school until their children were of an older age. In 1934, (Microfilm reel no. NL2358, National Library, Singapore) she opened a second school, the Tanglin Boarding School, in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. The school was intended to serve as a \\"near-by\\" alternative for expatriate families living in the region who would otherwise have to send their children to boarding schools in Britain. Many of the children who attended the school in Singapore then went on to the boarding school in the Cameron Highlands, which catered for students up to the age of 13. At the end of 1938, the number of pupils at the school grew to 68. At both schools, there was much emphasis on the British Empire. In preparing the boys for English Preparatory Schools, she would teach them football, taking the forward line across the playing field and showing them how to pass the ball. Similarly at cricket, she demonstrated the \\"straight bat\\" and footwork at the crease. Second World War Tanglin Boarding School, Cameron Highlands: Griffith-Jones (back row, fifth from left) with her staff and pupils outside the school's main building. Photo credit: Tanglin Trust School. The two schools continued to grow until the outbreak of the Second World War (1942‚Äì1945). The Japanese Occupation of the Malay Peninsula forced the closure of both schools, as British expatriates in the region (including Griffith- Jones) were interned by the Japanese at Singapore's Changi Prison and Sime Road Camp. Throughout her confinement, she displayed the same qualities of organisation and leadership that were a feature of her everyday life. In the course of her imprisonment, she rose to the challenge of internment and set about establishing a school for the internees. After the war, the two schools reopened, but the school at the Cameron Highlands failed to flourish. In 1948, it had to close due to an outbreak of poliomyelitis. A second closure occurred during the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960). The school had to be placed under full-time armed guard after the Malayan National Liberation Army surrounded the school. In 1950, it was forced to close by the Federal Government for security reasons. Thereafter, the property was sold to the British War Office. Retirement \\"Miss Griff\\" in riding kit at the Cameron Highlands. (c. 1950s). In 1958, Griffith-Jones retired to the Cameron Highlands and the British European Association, now the British Association of Singapore, took over the private company, 'Tanglin School Limited'.

For many years, she served as Secretary of the Cameron Highlands Church (which is presently known as All Souls' Church). (Microfilm reel no. NL3312, National Library, Singapore). In mid-1958, she offered to donate a site adjoining the former Slim School grounds for the erection of a school chapel. However, after consultation with the District Officer, it was established that the State Government would not alienate any further land to the British Forces based at the retreat. Subsequently, she transferred the land to the Anglican Diocese on the understanding that a small church would be built on it. The construction of the church commenced in 1958. The Nissen hut structure was completed in September that same year. The name 'All Souls' Church' was given at the church's consecration on Thursday, 30 April 1959. The Right Rev H W Baines, Bishop of Singapore and Malaya, conducted the services. Awards Griffith- Jones received three awards during her lifetime. Her MBE, which she received in her twenties, was elevated to an OBE for her services to education. In 1962, the Sultan of Pahang bestowed on her the Pingat Jasa Kebaktian award for meritorious service. Death Griffith-Jones died in 1973 at the Ipoh General Hospital after suffering a severe stroke. She was buried in Tapah, Perak, in the foothills of the Cameron Highlands. In 2015, her grave was visited by a group of students from Singapore's Tanglin Trust School. They read out a prepared text and placed a floral tribute on her grave before leaving.

A chalk often corresponds to a platoon-sized unit for air assault operations, or a company-minus-sized organization for airborne operations. For air transport operations, it can consist of up to a company-plus-sized unit. Oftentimes, a load of paratroopers in one aircraft, prepared for a drop, is also referred to as a stick. The term was first coined in World War II for airborne troops during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Europe. The aircraft flight number was placed on the troops' backs with chalk. It was later used during the Vietnam War, when it was common practice to number with chalk the sides of the helicopters involved in an operation. In current military terminology a \\"chalk\\" may mean either passengers or equipment loaded as cargo. Equipment is loaded in the order it will be needed on arrival. It is not uncommon for planners to refer to aircraft loads by their chalk number, \\"You are in chalk five but your gear will be shipped in chalk two.\\" In the Army 75th Ranger Regiment they use the term chalk. A chalk can be made of a Company or as small as a four man fire team. It takes no less than four men to make a fire team so that is the smallest number of men that can be called a chalk. In some instances, when a convoy clearance cannot be obtained, a convoy will be divided up into different groups with four or less trucks in each group. Those groups will be referred to as chalk one, chalk two, chalk three, etc. This is to avoid having to obtain a convoy clearance while still maintaining power in numbers while traveling.

Instruction and practice of the double-tap improves overall accuracy as shooters often do not have the gun fully extended on the first shot meaning the second of a double-tap is usually the better. The term hammer is sometimes used to describe a double tap in which the firearm's sights are not reacquired by the shooter between shots. History The origin of the double tap technique is credited to William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, British police chiefs working in Shanghai during the 1930s who developed the technique in order to overcome the limitations of full metal jacketed (FMJ) ammunition. FMJ ammunition is commonly used by militaries for feeding reliability, adherence to the Hague Conventions regarding non-expanding ammunition, and improved penetration. FMJ rounds can fail to cause sufficient damage, requiring more hits and better shot placement. In Ian Dear‚Äôs book Sabotage and Subversion about British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) forces, Fairbairn is reported to have instructed SOE personnel in the double tap from 1944 to 1945 at the SOE training school directed by Fairbairn and Sykes near Arisaig in Scotland. The term \\"double tap\\" is now used to describe the broader technique of firing two rounds quickly and accurately to disable an opponent. The tactic is still used today by firearms handlers, police tactical teams, military personnel, counter-terrorist combat units, and other special operations forces personnel. The Russian assault rifle AN-94 can automatically shoot two bullets in a rapid burst to penetrate body armor better. Double taps are an integral part of the El Presidente combat pistol shooting drill developed by Jeff Cooper in the 1970s and published in the January/February 1979 issue of American Handgunner. Also developed by Cooper in the 1970s is the Mozambique Drill or Failure Drill, for a situation where a double-tap to the torso fails to stop an attacker, adding a third shot to the head. Technique In the double-tap technique, after the first round is fired, the shooter quickly reacquires the sights for a fast second shot. This skill can be practiced by firing two shots at a time, taking time between the shots to reacquire the sights. With practice, the time between shots grows shorter and shorter until it seems to the observer as if the shooter is just pulling the trigger twice very quickly. According to a U.S. Army training manual, \\"There is a natural arc of the front sight post after the round is fired and the recoil kicks in. The soldier lets the barrel go with this arc and immediately brings the front sight post back on target and takes a second shot. The soldier does not fight the recoil. In combat, soldiers shoot until the enemy goes down. For multiple targets, each target should receive a double tap. After all targets are engaged, soldiers engage the targets again as needed.\\" Double tap strike The term has also been used more recently to refer to the practice of following up a strike, e.g., a missile, air strikes, artillery shelling or improvised explosive device attack with a second strike several minutes later, hitting response teams, helpers, and medics rushing to the site. Double-tap strikes have been used by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, by the United States in Pakistan and Yemen, and the Russian and Syrian governments in the Syrian Civil War.

It got its name from the finely cut strands appearing like 'shag' fabric and was originally considered poor quality. Various types of cut are used; most shag blends use a simple mixture of cutting styles, consisting mostly of loose cut but also krumble kake, ribbon cut and flake may be used. Some shag blends use cuts reminiscent of pipe tobacco. These were imported to the United Kingdom by Rory Innes following the Virginia tobacco plantations in North America. A cigarette made with shag tobacco may be called a rollie, a roll-up/dole-up or hand-rolled. The flat bags in which shag is typically packaged for commercial sale are often called tobacco pouches. Oppositely, pre-processed and packaged cigarettes may be referred to colloquially as tailor-mades or straights. Shag styles There are several shag blends or tobacco styles using different tobaccos, curing techniques and cutting types. Sometimes additives like sugar, glycerol and fruit flavors are added. *American shag is typically a mixture of domestic and/or imported tobacco and air cured Burley. *Virginia or Light blends are mainly made up of Virginia tobacco. *Smooth adds Georgia tobaccos to a Light blend. *Halfzware, meaning \\"half heavy\\" in Dutch, is a combination of Light and Zware shag, nowadays called Stevige. *Turkish is a blend that mainly consists of Turkish Tobaccos like Yenidje, Samsun, Bafra etc. *Zware, meaning \\"heavy\\" in Dutch, consists mainly of fire cured Kentucky, Latakia and air cured Paraguay. Netherlands Shag tobacco has always had a high market-share in the Dutch tobacco-market, although it is declining.

The three parishes were part of the hundred of Houndsborough.

As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements. Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including Nicole-Reine Lepaute's prediction of Halley's Comet, and Maria Mitchell's computation of the motion of Venus. The first algorithm intended to be executed by a computer was designed by Ada Lovelace who was a pioneer in the field. Grace Hopper was the first person to design a compiler for a programming language. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, and up to World War II, programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the Harvard Computers, codebreaking at Bletchley Park and engineering at NASA. After the 1960s, the \\"soft work\\" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern software, and the importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as Meg Whitman, president and chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Marissa Mayer, president and CEO of Yahoo! and key spokesperson at Google. History= 1700s = Nicole-Reine Etable de la Bri√®re Lepaute was one of a team of human computers who worked with Alexis- Claude Clairaut and Joseph-J√©r√¥me Le Fran√ßais de Lalande to predict the date of the return of Halley's Comet. They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes. Their methods were followed by successive human computers. They divided large calculations into \\"independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into a final product\\" and then checked for errors. Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, working for the Connaissance de Temps and publishing predictions of solar eclipses. = 1800s = Harvard computers One of the first computers for the American Nautical Almanac was Maria Mitchel. Her work on the assignment was to compute the motion of the planet Venus. The Almanac never became a reality, but Mitchell became the first astronomy professor at Vassar. Ada Lovelace was the first person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the Analytical Engine created by Charles Babbage. As a result, she is often regarded as the first female computer programmer. Lovelace was introduced to Babbage's difference engine when she was 17. In 1840, she wrote to Babbage and asked if she could become involved with his first machine. By this time, Babbage had moved on to his idea for the Analytical Engine. A paper describing the Analytical Engine, Notions sur la machine analytique, published by L.F. Menabrea, came to the attention of Lovelace, who not only translated it into English, but corrected mistakes made by Menabrea. Babbage suggested that she expand the translation of the paper with her own ideas, which, signed only with her initials, AAL, \\"synthesized the vast scope of Babbage's vision.\\" Lovelace imagined the kind of impact of the Analytical Engine might have on society. She drew up explanations of how the engine could handle inputs, outputs, processing and data storage. She also created several proofs to show how the engine would handle calculations of Bernoulli Numbers on its own. The proofs are considered the first examples of a computer program. Lovelace downplayed her role in her work during her life, for example, in signing her contributions with AAL so as not be \\"accused of bragging.\\" After the Civil War in the United States, more women were hired as human computers. Many were war widows looking for ways to support themselves. Others were hired when the government opened positions to women because of a shortage of men to fill the roles. Annie Jump Cannon working at Harvard Anna Winlock asked to become a computer for the Harvard Observatory in 1875 and was hired to work for 25 cents an hour. By 1880, Edward Charles Pickering had hired several women to work for him at Harvard because he knew that women could do the job as well as men and he could ask them to volunteer or work for less pay. The women, described as \\"Pickering's harem\\" and also as the Harvard Computers, performed clerical work that the male employees and scholars considered to be tedious at a fraction of the cost of hiring a man. The women working for Pickering cataloged around ten thousand stars, discovered the Horsehead Nebula and developed the system to describe stars. One of the \\"computers,\\" Annie Jump Cannon, could classify stars at a rate of three stars per minute. The work for Pickering became so popular that women volunteered to work for free even when the computers were being paid. Even though they performed an important role, the Harvard Computers were paid less than factory workers. By the 1890s, women computers were college graduates looking for jobs where they could use their training in a useful way. Florence Tebb Weldon, was part of this group and provided computations relating to biology and evidence for evolution, working with her husband, W.F. Raphael Weldon. Florence Weldon's calculations demonstrated that statistics could be used to support Darwin's theory of evolution. Another human computer involved in biology was Alice Lee, who worked with Karl Pearson. Pearson hired two sisters to work as part-time computers at his Biometrics Lab, Beatrice and Frances Cave-Brown-Cave. = 1910s = During World War I, Karl Pearson and his Biometrics Lab helped produce ballistics calculations for the British Ministry of Munitions. Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave helped calculate trajectories for bomb shells. In 1916, Cave-Brown-Cave left Pearson's employ and started working full-time for the Ministry. In the United States, women computers were hired to calculate ballistics in 1918, working in a building on the Washington Mall. One of the women, Elizabeth Webb Wilson, worked as the chief computer. After the war, women who worked as ballistics computers for the U.S. government had trouble finding jobs in computing and Wilson eventually taught high school math. = 1920s = AT&T; telephone switchboard In the early 1920s, Iowa State College, professor George Snedecor worked to improve the school's science and engineering departments, experimenting with new punch- card machines and calculators. Snedecor also worked with human calculators most of them women, including Mary Clem. Clem coined the term \\"zero check\\" to help identify errors in calculations. The computing lab, run by Clem, became one of the most powerful computing facilities of the time. Women computers also worked at the American Telephone and Telegraph company. These human computers worked with electrical engineers to help figure out how to boost signals with vacuum tube amplifiers. One of the computers, Clara Froelich, was eventually moved along with the other computers to their own division where they worked with a mathematician, Thornton Fry, to create new computational methods. Froelich studied IBM tabulating equipment and desk calculating machines to see if she could adapt the machine method to calculations. Edith Clarke was the first woman to earn a degree in electrical engineering and who worked as the first professionally employed electrical engineer in the United States. She was hired by General Electric as a full engineer in 1923. Clarke also filed a patent in 1921 for a graphical calculator to be used in solving problems in power lines. It was granted in 1925. = 1930s = The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) which became NASA hired a group of five women in 1935 to work as a computer pool. The women worked on the data coming from wind tunnel and flight tests. = 1940s = Woman working on a Bombe computing device \\"Tedious\\" computing and calculating was seen as \\"women's work\\" through the 1940s resulting in the term \\"kilogirl\\", invented by a member of the Applied Mathematics Panel in the early 1940s. A kilogirl of energy was \\"equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labor.\\" While women's contributions to the United States war effort during World War II was championed in the media, their roles and the work they did was minimized. This included minimizing the complexity, skill and knowledge needed to work on computers or work as human computers. During WWII, women did most of the ballistics computing, seen by male engineers as being below their level of expertise. Black women computers worked as hard (or more often, twice as hard) as their white counterparts, but in segregated situations. By 1943, almost all people employed as computers were women; one report said \\"programming requires lots of patience, persistence and a capacity for detail and those are traits that many girls have\\". NACA expanded its pool of women human computers in the 1940s. NACA recognized in 1942 that \\"the engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could.\\" In 1943 two groups, segregated by race, worked on the east and west side of Langley Air Force Base. The black women were the West Area Computers. Unlike their white counterparts, the black women were asked by NACA to re-do college courses they had already passed and many never received promotions. Women were also working on ballistic missile calculations. In 1948, women such as Barbara Paulson were working on the WAC Corporal, determining trajectories the missiles would take after launch. Women worked with cryptography and, after some initial resistance, many operated and worked on the Bombe machines. Joyce Aylard operated the Bombe machine testing different methods to break the Enigma code. Joan Clarke was a cryptographer who worked with her friend, Alan Turing, on the Enigma machine at Bletchley Park. When she was promoted to a higher salary grade, there were no positions in the civil service for a \\"senior female cryptanalyst,\\" and she was listed as a linguist instead. While Clarke developed a method of increasing the speed of double-encrypted messages, unlike many of the men, her decryption technique was not named after her. Other cryptographers at Bletchley included Margaret Rock, Mavis Lever (later Batey), Ruth Briggs and Kerry Howard. In 1941, Batey's work enabled the Allies to break the Italians' naval code before the Battle of Cape Matapan. In the United States, several faster Bombe machines were created. Women, like Louise Pearsall, were recruited from the WAVES to work on code breaking and operate the American Bombe machines. Hedy Lamarr and co-inventor, George Antheil, worked on a frequency hopping method to help the Navy control torpedoes remotely. The Navy passed on their idea, but Lamarr and Antheil received a patent for the work on August 11, 1942. This technique would later be used again, first in the 1950s at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division and is used in everyday technology such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Marlyn Wescoff (standing) and Ruth Lichterman reprogram the ENIAC in 1946. The programmers of the ENIAC computer in 1944, were six female mathematicians; Marlyn Meltzer, Betty Holberton, Kathleen Antonelli, Ruth Teitelbaum, Jean Bartik, and Frances Spence who were human computers at the Moore School's computation lab. Adele Goldstine was their teacher and trainer and they were known as the \\"ENIAC girls.\\" The women who worked on ENIAC were warned that they would not be promoted into professional ratings which were only for men. Designing the hardware was \\"men's work\\" and programming the software was \\"women's work.\\" Sometimes women were given blueprints and wiring diagrams to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it. They learned how the ENIAC worked by repairing it, sometimes crawling through the computer, and by fixing \\"bugs\\" in the machinery. Even though the programmers were supposed to be doing the \\"soft\\" work of programming, in reality, they did that and fully understood and worked with the hardware of the ENIAC. When the ENIAC was revealed in 1946, Goldstine and the other women prepared the machine and the demonstration programs it ran for the public. None of their work in preparing the demonstrations was mentioned in the official accounts of the public events. After the demonstration, the university hosted an expensive celebratory dinner to which none of the ENIAC six were invited. In Canada, Beatrice Worsley started working at the National Research Council of Canada in 1947 where she was an aerodynamics research officer. A year later, she started working in the new Computational Centre at the University of Toronto. She built a differential analyzer in 1948 and also worked with IBM machines in order to do calculations for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. She went to study the EDSAC at the University of Cambridge in 1949. She wrote the program that was run the first time EDSAC performed its first calculations on May 6, 1949. Grace Hopper was the first person to create a compiler for a programming language and one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, an electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. Hopper's work with computers started in 1943, when she started working at the Bureau of Ordnance's Computation Project at Harvard where she programmed the Harvard Mark I. Hopper not only programmed the computer, but created a 500-page comprehensive manual for it. Even though Hopper created the manual, which was widely cited and published, she was not specifically credited in it. Hopper is often credited with the coining of the term \\"bug\\" and \\"debugging\\" when a moth caused the Mark II to malfunction. While a moth was found and the process of removing it called \\"debugging,\\" the terms were already part of the language of programmers. = 1950s = Annie Easley at NASA Grace Hopper continued to contribute to computer science through the 1950s. She brought the idea of using compilers from her time at Harvard to UNIVAC which she joined in 1949. Other women who were hired to program UNIVAC included Adele Mildred Koss, Frances E. Holberton, Jean Bartik, Frances Morello and Lillian Jay. To program the UNIVAC, Hopper and her team used the FLOW-MATIC programming language, which she developed. Holberton wrote a code, C-10, that allowed for keyboard inputs into a general-purpose computer. Holberton also developed the Sort-Merge Generator in 1951 which was used on the UNIVAC I. The Sort-Merge Generator marked the first time a computer \\"used a program to write a program.\\" Holberton suggested that computer housing should be beige or oatmeal in color which became a long- lasting trend. Koss worked with Hopper on various algorithms and a program that was a precursor to a report generator. Klara Dan von Neumann was one of the main programmers of the MANIAC, a more advanced version of ENIAC. Her work helped the field of meteorology and weather prediction. The NACA, and subsequently NASA, recruited women computers following World War II. By the 1950s, a team was performing mathematical calculations at the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, including Annie Easley, Katherine Johnson and Kathryn Peddrew. At the National Bureau of Standards, Margaret R. Fox was hired to work as part of the technical staff of the Electronic Computer Laboratory in 1951. In 1956, Gladys West was hired by the U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory as a human computer. West was involved in calculations that let to the development of GPS. At Convair Aircraft Corporation, Joyce Currie Little was one of the original programmers for analyzing data received from the wind tunnels. She used punch cards on an IBM 650 which was located in a different building from the wind tunnel. To save time in the physical delivery of the punch cards, she and her colleague, Maggie DeCaro, put on roller skates to get to and from the building faster. In Israel, Thelma Estrin worked on the design and development of WEIZAC, one of the world's first large-scale programmable electronic computers. In the Soviet Union the IT industry was dominated by women; a team of them designed the first digital computer in 1951. In the UK, Kathleen Booth worked with her husband, Andrew Booth on several computers at Birkbeck College. Kathleen Booth was the programmer and Andrew built the machines. Kathleen developed Assembly Language at this time. Kateryna Yushchenko created the Address programming language for the MESM in 1955. = 1960s = PFC Patricia Barbeau operates a tape-drive on the IBM 729 at Camp Smith. Milly Koss who had worked at UNIVAC with Hopper, started work at Control Data Corporation (CDC) in 1965. There she developed algorithms for graphics, including graphic storage and retrieval. Mary K. Hawes of Burroughs Corporation set up a meeting in 1959 to discuss the creation a computer language that would be shared between businesses. Six people, including Hopper, attended to discuss the philosophy of creating a common business language (CBL). Hopper became involved in developing COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) where she innovated new symbolic ways to write computer code. Hopper developed programming language that was easier to read and \\"self- documenting.\\" After COBOL was submitted to the CODASYL Executive Committee, Betty Holberton did further editing on the language before it was submitted to the Government Printing Office in 1960. IBM were slow to adopt COBOL, which hindered its progress but it was accepted as a standard in 1962, after Hopper had demonstrated the compiler working both on UNIVAC and RCA computers. The development of COBOL led to the generation of compilers and generators, most of which were created or refined by women such as Koss, Nora Moser, Deborah Davidson, Sue Knapp, Gertrude Tierney and Jean E. Sammet. Sammet, who worked at IBM starting in 1961 was responsible for developing the programming language, FORMAC. She published a book, Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals (1969), which was considered the \\"standard work on programming languages,\\" according to Denise G√ºrer It was \\"one of the most used books in the field,\\" according to The Times in 1972. Margaret Hamilton in 1969, standing next to listings of the software she and her MIT team produced for the Apollo project Between 1961 and 1963, Margaret Hamilton began to study software reliability while she was working at the US SAGE air defense system. In 1965, she was responsible for programming the software for the onboard flight software on the Apollo mission computers. After Hamilton had completed the program, the code was sent to Raytheon where \\"expert seamstresses\\" called the \\"Little Old Ladies\\" actually hardwired the code by threading copper wire through magnetic rings. Each system could store more than 12,000 words that were represented by the copper wires. In 1964, the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced a \\"White-Hot\\" revolution in technology, that would give greater prominence to IT work. As women still held most computing and programming positions at this time, it was hoped that it would give them more positive career prospects. In 1965, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller became the first American woman to earn a doctorate in computer science. Keller helped develop BASIC while working as a graduate student at Dartmouth, where the university \\"broke the 'men only' rule\\" so she could use its computer science center. Christine Darden began working for NASA's computing pool in 1967 having graduated from the Hampton Institute. Women were involved in the development of Whirlwind, including Judy Clapp. She created the prototype for an air defense system for Whirlwind which used radar input to track planes in the air and could direct aircraft courses. In 1969, Elizabeth \\"Jake\\" Feinler, who was working for Stanford, made the first Resource Handbook for ARPANET. This led to the creation of the ARPANET directory, which was built by Feinler with a staff of mostly women. Without the directory, \\"it was nearly impossible to navigate the ARPANET.\\" By the end of the decade, the general demographics of programmers had shifted away from being predominantly women, as they had before the 1940s. Though women accounted for around 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during the 1960s, few were promoted to leadership roles and women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts. Cosmopolitan ran an article in the April 1967 issue about women in programming called \\"The Computer Girls.\\" Even while magazines such as Cosmopolitan saw a bright future for women in computers and computer programming in the 1960s, the reality was that women were still being marginalized. Katherine Johnson working at NASA in 1966 = 1970s = Using an NCR 796-201 cathode-ray terminal, circa 1972 In the early 1970s, Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called Project One. Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the Internet. To work on the project, Hardt-English obtained an expensive SDS-940 computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972. They created an electronic library and housed it in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley. This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, Jude Milhon. After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database and a Social Services Referral Directory. Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries. The database was maintained and in use until 2009. In the early 1970s, Elizabeth \\"Jake\\" Feinler, who worked on the Resource Directory for ARPANET, and her team created the first WHOIS directory. Feinler set up a server at the Network Information Center (NIC) at Stanford which would work as a directory that could retrieve relevant information about a person or entity. She and her team worked on the creation of domains, with Feinler suggesting that domains be divided by categories based on where the computers were kept. For example, military computers would have the domain of .mil, computers at educational institutions would have .edu. Feinler worked for NIC until 1989. Jean E. Sammet served as the first woman president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), holding the position between 1974 and 1976. Adele Goldberg was one of seven programmers that developed Smalltalk in the 1970s, and wrote the majority of the language's documentation. It was one of the first object-oriented programming languages the base of the current graphic user interface, that has its roots in the 1968 The Mother of All Demos by Douglas Engelbart. Smalltalk was used by Apple to launch Apple Lisa in 1983, the first personal computer with a GUI, and a year later its Macintosh. Windows 1.0, based on the same principles, was launched a few months later in 1985. In the late 1970s, women such as Paulson and Sue Finley wrote programs for the Voyager mission. Voyager continues to carry their codes inside its own memory banks as it leaves the solar system. In 1979, Ruzena Bajcsy founded the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. In the mid-70s, Joan Margaret Winters began working at IBM as part of a \\"human factors project,\\" called SHARE. In 1978, Winters was the deputy manager of the project and went on to lead the project between 1983 and 1987. The SHARE group worked on researching how software should be designed to consider human factors. Erna Schneider Hoover developed a computerized switching system for telephone calls that would replace switchboards. Her software patent for the system, issued in 1971, was one of the first software patents ever issued. = 1980s = Shelley Lake working on computer graphics at Digital Productions, 1983 Gwen Bell developed the Computer Museum in 1980. The museum, which collected computer artifacts became a non-profit organization in 1982 and in 1984, Bell moved it to downtown Boston. Adele Goldberg served as president of ACM between 1984 and 1986. In 1986, Lixia Zhang was the only woman and graduate student to participate in the early Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meetings.. Zhang was involved in early Internet development. In 1982, Marsha R. Williams became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in computer science. Sometimes known as the \\"Betsy Ross of the personal computer,\\" according to the New York Times, Susan Kare worked with Steve Jobs to design the original icons for the Macintosh. Kare designed the moving watch, paintbrush and trash can elements that made using a Mac user-friendly. Kare worked for Apple until the mid-1980s, going on to work on icons for Windows 3.0. Other types of computer graphics were being developed by Nadia Magnenat Thalmann in Canada. Thalmann started working on computer animation to develop \\"realistic virtual actors\\" first at the University of Montr√©al in 1980 and later in 1988 at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. In the field of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI), French computer scientist, Jo√´lle Coutaz developed the presentation- abstraction-control (PAC) model in 1987. She founded the User Interface group at the Laboratorire de G√©nie Informatique of IMAG where they worked on different problems relating to user interface and other software tools. As Ethernet became the standard for networking computers locally, Radia Perlman, who worked at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), was asked to \\"fix\\" limitations that Ethernet imposed on large network traffic. In 1985, Perlman came up with a way to route information packets from one computer to another in an \\"infinitely scalable\\" way that allowed large networks like the Internet to function. Her solution took less than a few days to design and write up. The name of the algorithm she created is the Spanning Tree Protocol. In 1988, Stacy Horn, who had been introduced to bulletin board systems (BBS) through The WELL, decided to create her own online community in New York, which she called the East Coast Hang Out (ECHO). Horn invested her own money and pitched the idea for ECHO to others after bankers refused to hear her business plan. Horn built her BBS using UNIX, which she and her friends taught to one another. Eventually ECHO moved an office in Tribeca in the early 1990s and started getting press attention. ECHO's users could post about topics that interested them, and chat with one another, and were provided email accounts. Around half of ECHO's users were women. ECHO was still online as of 2018. Europe was somewhat behind other countries in developing an Internet infrastructure. A project was developed in the mid-1980s to create an academic network in Europe using the Open System Interconnection (OSI) standards. Borka Jerman Bla≈æiƒç, a Yugoslavian computer scientist was invited to work on the project. She was involved in establishing a Yugoslav Research and Academic Network (YUNAC) in 1989 and registered the domain of .yu for the country. Computer and video games became popular in the 1980s, but many were primarily action-oriented and not designed from a woman's point of view. Stereotypical characters such as the damsel in distress featured prominently and consequently were not inviting towards women. Dona Bailey designed Centipede, where the player shoots insects, as a reaction to such games, later saying \\"It didn't seem bad to shoot a bug\\". Carol Shaw, considered to be the first modern female games designer, released a 3D version of tic-tac-toe for the Atari 2600 in 1980. Roberta Williams and her husband Ken, founded Sierra Online and pioneered the graphic adventure game format in Mystery House and the King's Quest series. The games had a friendly graphical user interface and introduced humor and puzzles. Cited as an important game designer, her influence spread from Sierra to other companies such as LucasArts and beyond. Brenda Laurel worked on porting games from arcade versions to the Atari 400 and Atari 800 computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She then went to work for Activision, writing the manual for Maniac Mansion. 1984 was the year of Women Into Science and Engineering (WISE). A 1984 report by Ebury Publishing reported that in a typical family, only 5% of mothers and 19% of daughters were using a computer at home, compared to 25% of fathers and 51% of sons. To counteract this, the company launched a series of software titles designed towards women and publicised in Good Housekeeping. Anita Borg, who had been noticing that women were under-represented in computer science, founded an email support group, Systers, in 1987. =1990s= Jaime Levy helped popularise the e-Zine in the 1990s. By the 1990s, computing was dominated by men. The proportion of female computer science graduates peaked in 1984 around 37 per cent, and then steadily declined. Although the end of the 20th century saw an increase in women scientists and engineers, this did not hold true for computing, which stagnated. Despite this, they were very involved in working on hypertext and hypermedia projects in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A team of women at Brown University, including Nicole Yankelovich and Karen Catlin, developed Intermedia and invented the anchor link. Apple partially funded their project and incorporated their concepts into Apple operating systems. Sun Microsystems Sun Link Service was developed by Amy Pearl. Janet Walker developed the first system to use bookmarks when she created the Symbolics Document Examiner. In 1989, Wendy Hall created a hypertext project called Microcosm, which was based on digitized multimedia material found in the Mountbatten archive. Cathy Marshall worked on the NoteCards system at Xerox PARC. NoteCards went on to influence Apple's HyperCard. As the Internet became the World Wide Web, developers like Hall adapted their programs to include Web viewers. Her Microcosm was especially adaptable to new technologies, including animation and 3-D models. In 1994, Hall helped organize the first conference for the Web. Sarah Allen, the co-founder of After Effects, co-founded a commercial software company called CoSA in 1990. In 1995, she started working on the Shockwave team for Macromedia where she was the lead developer of the Shockwave Mulituser Server, the Flash Media Server and Flash video. Following the increased popularity of the Internet in the 1990s, online spaces were set up to cater for women, including the online community Women's WIRE and the technical and support forum LinuxChix. Women's WIRE, launched by Nancy Rhine and Ellen Pack in October 1993, was the first Internet company to specifically target this demographic. A conference for women in computer-related jobs, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, was first launched in 1994 by Anita Borg. Game designer Brenda Laurel started working at Interval Research in 1992, and began to think about the differences in the way girls and boys experienced playing video games. After interviewing around 1,000 children and 500 adults, she determined that games weren't designed with girls' interests in mind. The girls she spoke with wanted more games with open worlds and characters they could interact with. Her research led to Interval Research giving Laurel's research team their own company in 1996, Purple Moon. Also in 1996, Mattel's game, Barbie Fashion Designer, became the first best-selling game for girls. Purple Moon's first two games based on a character called Rockett, made it to the 100 best-selling games in the years they were released. In 1999, Mattel bought out Purple Moon. Jaime Levy created the one of the first e-Zines in the early 1990s, starting with CyberRag, which included articles, games and animations loaded onto diskettes that anyone with a Mac could access. Later, she renamed the zine to Electronic Hollywood. Billy Idol commissioned Levy to create a disk for his album, Cyberpunk. She was hired to be the creative director of the online magazine, Word, in 1995. Cyberfeminists, VNS Matrix, made up of Josephine Starrs, Juliane Pierce, Francesca da Rimini and Virginia Barratt, created art in the early 1990s linking computer technology and women's bodies. In 1997, there was a gathering of cyberfeminists in Kassel, called the First Cyberfeminist International. In China, Hu Qiheng, was the leader of the team who installed the first TCP/IP connection for China, connecting to the Internet on April 20, 1994. In 1995, Rosemary Candlin went to write software for CERN in Geneva. In the early 1990s, Nancy Hafkin was an important figure in working with the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) in enabling email connections in 10 African countries. Starting in 1999, Anne-Marie Eklund L√∂winder began to work with Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) in Sweden. She later made sure that the domain, .se, was the world's first top level domain name to be signed with DNSSEC. In the late 1990s, research by Jane Margolis led Carnegie Mellon to try to correct the male-female imbalance in computer science. From the late 1980s until the mid 1990s, Misha Mahowald developed several key foundations of the field of Neuromorphic engineering, while working at the California Institute of Technology and later at the ETH Zurich. More than 20 years after her untimely death, the Misha Mahowald Prize was named after her to recognize excellence in the field which she helped to create. =2000s= Former vice-president of Google Search Products and User Experience, former president and CEO of Yahoo!, Marissa Mayer In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to reduce the gender disparity in IT and get more women involved in computing again. A 2001 survey found that while both sexes use computers and the internet in equal measure, women were still five times less likely to choose it as a career or study the subject beyond standard secondary education. Journalist Emily Chang said a key problem has been personality tests in job interviews and the belief that good programmers are introverts, which tends to self-select the stereotype of an asocial white male nerd. In 2004, the National Center for Women & Information Technology was established by Lucy Sanders to address the gender gap. Carnegie Mellon University has made a concerted attempt to increase gender diversity in the computer science field, by selecting students based on a wide criteria including leadership ability, a sense of \\"giving back to the community\\" and high attainment in maths and science, instead of traditional computer programming expertise. As well as increase the intake of women into CMU, the programme produced better quality students because of the increased diversity making a stronger team. = 2010s = Despite the pioneering work of some designers, video games are still considered biased towards men. A 2013 survey by the International Game Developers Association revealed only 22% of game designers are women, although this is substantially higher than figures in previous decades. Working to bring inclusion to the world of open source project development, Coraline Ada Ehmke drafted the Contributor Covenant in 2014. By 2018, over 40,000 software projects have started using the Contributor Covenant, including TensorFlow, Vue and Linux. In 2014, Danielle George, professor at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester spoke at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on the subject of \\"how to hack your home\\", describing simple experiments involving computer hardware and demonstrating a giant game of Tetris by remote controlling lights in an office building. In 2017, Michelle Simmons founded the first quantum computing company in Australia. The team, which has made \\"great strides\\" in 2018, plans to develop a 10-qubit prototype silicon quantum integrated circuit by 2022. In the same year, Doina Precup became the head of DeepMind Montreal, working on artificial intelligence.  Gender gap in computing  In 1992, John Gray's Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus theorised that men and women tend to differ in ways of thinking, leading to them approaching technology and computing in different ways. One of the biggest problems facing women in computing in the modern era is that they often find themselves working in an environment that is largely unpleasant, so they don't stay on in the careers in programming and technology. A further issue is that if a class of computer scientists contains few women, those few can be singled out, leading to isolation and feelings of non-belonging, which can culminate in leaving the area. The gender disparity in IT is not global. The ratio of female to male computer scientists is significantly higher in India compared to the West, and in 2015, over half of internet entrepreneurs in China were women. In Europe, Bulgaria and Romania have the highest rates of women going into computer programming. In government universities in Saudi Arabia in 2014, Arab women made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science. It has been suggested there is a greater gap in countries where people of both sexes are treated more equally, contradicting any theories that society in general is to blame for any disparity. However, the ratio of African American female computer scientists in the US is significantly lower than the global average. In IT-based organisations, the ratio of men to women can vary between roles; for example, while most software developers at InfoWatch are male, half of usability designers and 80% of project managers are female. In 1991, Massachusetts Institute of Technology undergraduate Ellen Spertus wrote an essay \\"Why Are There So Few Women in Computer Science?\\", which complained about inherent sexism in IT, which was responsible for a lack of women in computing. She subsequently taught computer science at Mills College, Oakland in order to increase interest in IT for women. A key problem is a lack of female role models in the IT industry, alongside computer programmers in fiction and the media generally being male. The University of Southampton's Wendy Hall has said the attractiveness of computers to women decreased significantly in the 1980s when they \\"were sold as toys for boys\\", and believes the cultural stigma has remained ever since, and may even be getting worse. Kathleen Lehman, project manager of the BRAID Initiative at UCLA has said a problem is that typically women aim for perfection and feel disillusioned when code does not compile, whereas men may simply treat it as a learning experience. A report in the Daily Telegraph suggested that women generally prefer people-facing jobs, which many computing and IT positions do not have, while men prefer jobs geared towards objects and tasks. One issue is that the history of computing has focused on the hardware, which was a male dominated field, despite software being written predominantly by women in the early to mid 20th century. In 2013, a National Public Radio report said 20% of computer programmers in the US are female. There is no general consensus for any key reason there are less women in computing. In 2017, James Damore was fired from Google after claiming there was a biological reason for a lack of female computer scientists. The following year, Wikipedia was criticised for not having an article about scientist Donna Strickland until shortly after she won the Nobel Prize for Physics, which was attributed to a severe gender disparity of the site's editors. Dame Stephanie Shirley using the name Steve Shirley addressed some of the problems facing women in computing in the UK by setting up the software company Freelance Programmers (later F.I, then Xansa now Steria Sopra) offering the chance for women to work from home and part- time work  Awards  Shafi Goldwasser was the 2012 Turing award recipient for her collaborative work in cryptography.

The Association for Women in Computing was one of the first and is dedicated to promoting the advancement of women in computing professions. The CRA-W: Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research established in 1991 focused on increasing the number of women in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) research and education at all levels. AnitaB.org runs the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing yearly conference. The National Center for Women & Information Technology is a nonprofit that aims to increase the number of women in technology and computing. The Women in Technology International (WITI) is a global organization dedicated to the advancement of women in business and technology. The Arab Women in Computing has many chapters across the world and focuses on encouraging women to work with technology and provides networking opportunities between industry experts and academicians and university students. Some major societies and groups have offshoots dedicated to women. The Association for Computing Machinery's Council on Women in Computing (ACM-W) has over 36,000 members. BCSWomen is a women-only specialist group of the British Computer Society, founded in 2001.. In Ireland, the charity Teen Turn run after school training and work placements for girls, and Women in Technology and Science (WITS) advocate for the inclusion and promotion of women within STEM industries. The Women's Technology Empowerment Centre (W.TEC) is a non-profit organisation focused on providing technology education and mentoring to Nigerian women and girls. Black Girls Code is a non-profit focused on providing technology education to young African-American women. CodeChef, one of the world's largest competitive programming platforms runs a dedicated community called 'Women in Competitive Programming'. Other organisations dedicated to women in IT include Girl Develop It, a nonprofit organization that provides affordable programs for adult women interested in learning web and software development in a judgment- free environment, Girl Geek Dinners, an International group for women of all ages, Girls Who Code: a national non-profit organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology, LinuxChix, a women-oriented community in the open source movement and Systers, a moderated listserv dedicated to mentoring women in the IT industry.

Pineapple Poll is based on \\"The Bumboat Woman's Story\\", one of W. S. Gilbert's Bab Ballads, written in 1870. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera H.M.S. Pinafore was also based, in part, on this story. For the ballet, Cranko expanded the story of the Bab Ballad and added a happy ending. All the music is arranged from Sullivan's music. The piece premiered in 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre and was given many revivals internationally during the following decades. It remains in the repertoire of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. It has also been recorded many times. Background and productions Mackerras and his family were Gilbert and Sullivan fans. As a youth, at the all-male St Aloysius College in Sydney, he played Kate in The Pirates of Penzance, Leila in Iolanthe and Ko-Ko in The Mikado.Simeone, Nigel. \\"Sir Charles Mackerras (1925‚Äì2010): A Lifetime of Gilbert and Sullivan\\" (Part I), Gilbert and Sullivan News, Vol. V, No. 9, Autumn/Winter 2015, pp. 12‚Äì14, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society In 1941‚Äì42, while at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, he played the oboe for the J. C. Williamson Company during one of their Gilbert and Sullivan seasons. He was also a rehearsal pianist for the Kirsova ballet company, where he became familiar with the successful ballets based on Offenbach, Strauss and Rossini music: Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, Le Beau Danube and La Boutique fantasque. He felt that a similar arrangement of the music of Sullivan would also be popular. He had to wait a decade until the copyright on Sullivan's music expired at the end of 1950. Meanwhile, Mackerras had moved to London, studied conducting in Prague and, in 1948, become assistant conductor and repetiteur for Sadler's Wells Opera. Peggy van Praagh suggested that he work out the idea with the young choreographer John Cranko. Cranko expanded the plot of W. S. Gilbert's Bab Ballad \\"The Bumboat Woman's Story\\", in which the central character is named Poll Pineapple. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera H.M.S. Pinafore (especially its character Little Buttercup) was also based, in part, on this story. Cranko introduced new characters (Mrs Dimple) and gave Poll an admirer to enable a happy ending.Percival, pp. 83-85 Mackerras arranged the score of Pineapple Poll from the Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire, as well as Sullivan's comic opera Cox and Box (written with F. C. Burnand), and Sullivan's Overture di Ballo. Music from all of the extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas is included, except for Utopia Limited and The Grand Duke. Pineapple Poll premiered on 13 March 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre by the Sadler's Wells Ballet as part of the Festival of Britain. It was part of an evening of four Cranko ballets.The others were Sea Change, Beauty and the Beast and Pastorale The production was designed by Sir Osbert Lancaster, who later designed the 1971 D'Oyly Carte production of The Sorcerer. The ballet was a critical and popular success Sadler's Wells also toured this in the US.Jowitt, Deborah. \\"White Petticoats and Sailor Suits\\", The Village Voice, 12 March 1970, accessed 18 December 2015 The ballet was later produced by the Borovansky Ballet in 1954, Covent Garden in 1959, National Ballet of Canada in 1959, the Joffrey Ballet at City Center in New York City in 1970, Noverre Ballet in 1972 and Oslo Ballet in 1975.Percival, p. 239 In recent years, the ballet has fallen out of the professional ballet repertory in the US, although there was a revival in 2004 by Spectrum Dance Theater of Seattle, with new choreography by Donald Byrd,Kurtz, Sandra. \\"Broad Spectrum \\", Seattle Weekly, 9 October 2006, accessed 18 December 2015 and it is it is sometimes played as an orchestral piece.

Gervase Hughes wrote, \\"Although the orchestration is disfigured by over-reliance on glissando harps and succulent counter-subjects for the horns, much of the music comes over well in its new guise, and the combination of a melody from the opening chorus of Patience with the second act quintet from The Gondoliers is quite brilliant.\\"Hughes, p. 161 A black-and-white studio film of Pineapple Poll, danced by the Royal Ballet, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mackerras, was broadcast by BBC television in 1959. It starred Merle Park, David Blair and Stanley Holden.\\"The Royal Ballet in Pineapple Poll\\", BBC, accessed 19 December 2015 A DVD of this film was released in 2011 (also including The Lady and the Fool). A review in Musicweb International commented, \\"As a score, [Pineapple Poll] quite simply sparkles like freshly popped champagne. ... In fact, this is a comic masterpiece. Any viewer will be impressed with the vivacious dancing and the 'built in' humour which pervades the work ... would that it had been in colour! The costumes look as if they would have been absolutely magnificent. ...

Hot Cross Bun has arrived in Portsmouth, and the sailors, who are on shore leave, meet some pretty town's girls whom they like. Pineapple Poll then arrives with a basket of flowers. The sailors buy the flowers from Pineapple Poll to give to their girlfriends, some doing so reluctantly. Jasper, the 'pot boy' at the local inn, serves drinks to some of the sailors. Jasper is very interested in Pineapple Poll, but she haughtily rejects his proferred love. Captain Belaye of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun then arrives, and the sailors are horrified when their girlfriends swoon at the sight of the Captain. The sailors attempt to stop the girls, without success. Pineapple Poll also tries to capture the Captain's attention, but she does not have Jasper's restraining hand to stop her. When Captain Belaye is finally left alone, a girl (Blanche) arrives with her aunt (Mrs. Dimple). It is love at first sight for both the Captain and Blanche. Mrs. Dimple is initially opposed to the Captain's interest in her niece, but she finally relents. When Captain Belaye returns to the port, the town's girls and Pineapple Poll once again try to capture his interest. Captain Belaye manages to escape from the girls with much difficulty, and the girls are then left sighing after the Captain, while the members of his crew vent their anger against him. =Scene 2= It is nightfall, and some 'sailors' go up the gangplank to board the ship. Pineapple Poll arrives on the wharf with some naval clothes in which she then dresses herself (off-stage), following which Pineapple Poll also then goes up the gangplank to the ship. Jasper arrives at the wharf and is devastated to find Pineapple Poll's clothes. He mistakenly assumes that Pineapple Poll has drowned. Despondently, he gathers up Pineapple Poll's clothing and leaves. =Scene 3= The following morning, on board H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun, Captain Belaye is taking his 'crew' through drill. Although his 'crew' is dressed in the usual ship's uniforms, they are far smaller in build than usual - however, the Captain does not seem to realise that there is a disparity in their heights. The uniform which Pineapple Poll is wearing is not a uniform which a sailor would wear on board H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun, and she continually exercises en pointe, but the Captain appears oblivious to anything unusual about her as well. Captain Belaye also does not notice that his 'sailors' are looking up adoringly at him. When the cannon is fired, he is surprised at the reaction of the 'sailors', including Pineapple Poll (who faints at the sound). A church bell then tolls in the distance, and the Captain leaves the ship. A short while later, the Captain returns to the ship with Blanche (who is dressed as a bride) and Mrs. Dimple. The 'crew' all faint with shock. Pineapple Poll is the first to recover and to demonstrate to Captain Belaye that she is female. Then the other 'sailors' demonstrate that they, too, are female. Blanche is horrified, as is her aunt, at the ship's crew all being girls, and the Captain looks stunned. The ship's genuine crew then arrive, as does Jasper. The sailors are very annoyed with their girlfriends, and the girls have to coax and cajole the sailors to take them back. Jasper has a tougher time with Pineapple Poll, who is still hankering after the Captain. Belaye, who has now been promoted to the rank of Admiral, returns to the deck with his bride, Blanche, and Blanche's Aunt, Mrs. Dimple. Pineapple Poll swoons at the sight of the Admiral, much to Jasper's distress. Mrs. Dimple calls to Jasper and then gives him the Admiral's former Captain's attire. Jasper puts on the Captain's hat and coat - and becomes the new Captain of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun as a result (even though Jasper has never been a sailor), and Pineapple Poll's affections and interest are immediately transferred from the Admiral to Jasper. The sailors of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun are most displeased that the 'pot boy' has suddenly been elevated to be their Captain, and they openly show their disdain for him. All of the girls then return to the ship's deck, wearing their own clothes, and are welcomed back by their delighted boyfriends. The girls swoon at the sight of Jasper in his new Captain's uniform, but this time the sailors are able to keep their girlfriends in check, and all ends happily.

In 2011 the parish, which includes the hamlet of Swell, had a population of 609. History The name of the village comes from a Domesday manor which measured five hides (about . Fivehead was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. Swell Court Farmhouse dates from the mid to late 15th century. Cathanger manor house dates from 1559, with Langford Manor having been built around the same period. Nearby was RAF Merryfield, a World War II airfield. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. Fivehead is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography There are two nearby Sites of Special Scientific Interest at Fivehead Arable Fields and Fivehead Woods and Meadow.

Within the state, the school is commonly known as Fort Smith Northside. History The original Fort Smith High School completed construction in fall 1897 and was described as one of the \\"Seven Wonders of Fort Smith\\" with its English castle-style, buff-brick and grey-stone building until a deadly tornado nearly destroyed the building three months later January 11, 1898. Also in Fort Smith, Howard High School (1888) and Lincoln High School (1892), both black schools, ran until 1966. On November 19, 1928, Fort Smith High School moved into a new building on 23rd and B Street in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The population of Fort Smith at the time was 31,400. The new building was dedicated on February 15, 1929, just before the mid-term class graduation could take place. The first year, 848 students enrolled in the high school (it could accommodate 3,000 students). With the new large building, many local organizations, as well as nationally known groups and individuals used the 1,060-seat auditorium for performances and other types of events. Since it was built, the auditorium has been visited by such famous people as Helen Olheim, opera singer with the Metropolitan Opera (1937‚Äì38); Carl Sandburg, poet, biographer and entertainer (1939‚Äì40); Margaret Bourke-White, war correspondent, photographer, author (1943‚Äì44); Nancy Gean, FSHS graduate and fashion analyst for Butterick (1947‚Äì48); Nelson Bennett, world-famous model for painters and sculptors (1965‚Äì66); and Shawntel Smith, Miss America (1995‚Äì96). In 1934, the Fort Smith High School yearbook, Sounder, changed its name to Bruin. During its formative years, the senior class of 1937 hired Harry Alford of Chicago to write the Fort Smith High School Alma Mater, which has remained the same until today for now Northside High School. In 1956, the school built an annex. The following year, enrollment for students was up to 1,738, which made Fort Smith High School the largest high school in Arkansas. During the school year of 1960-61, the Farnsworth Rose Garden was completed on the campus. Fort Smith High School was officially renamed Northside High School in 1963. Shortly thereafter, the Field House was opened and a marquee was installed in front of the campus in 1964. When Lincoln High School closed, Northside's enrollment continued to grow. Improvements were made continually for the next several years. First, Grizzly Stadium was renamed Mayo-Thompson Stadium. The campus continued to grow with the addition of the Fine Arts building, learning lab, and elevator during the 1980-81 school year. The Rogers Book Store was purchased to house computer labs and kept its original name, the Schlenker Building. In 2003-04, the original gym was renovated with a new finished floor, a film room, and new custom oak lockers. The original floor, possibly the only one of its kind, required special efforts to be able to reseal and finish it.

It was inaugurated in 1880 but destroyed by bombs in 1944. It was rebuilt, slowly, in the 1970s, opening again in 1981. Many important operas were performed for the first time in Frankfurt, including Carl Orff's Carmina Burana in 1937. The square in front of the building is known as Opernplatz (Opera Square). The Alte Oper is located in the inner city district, Innenstadt, within the banking district Bankenviertel. The Oper Frankfurt now plays in the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt, completed in 1951, which it shares with the Schauspiel Frankfurt theatre company. Inauguration Frankfurt opera house, c. 1880 The building was designed by the Berlin architect Richard Lucae, financed by the citizens of Frankfurt and built by Philipp Holzmann. Construction began in 1873.Gro√ü, p. 50 It opened on October 20, 1880. Among the guests was Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who was impressed and said: Das k√∂nnte ich mir in Berlin nicht erlauben. (I couldn't permit myself this sort of thing in Berlin.) The citizens of Frankfurt, who had to finance the structure (initial estimate two million marks), were rather sceptical at first. Alluding to the inscription on the frieze :\\"Dem Wahren, Sch√∂nen, Guten\\", (\\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\\") The folkloristic Frankfurt poet Adolf Stoltze wrote, in his best Hessian dialect: :Dem Wahre, Scheene, Gute, die Berjerschaft mu√ü blute. (To the true, the beautiful, the good, the citizenry must bleed.) Post WWII Ruins of the Alte Oper in 1958 The Alte Oper was extensively damaged by bombing raids during World War II in 1944, though many of the outside walls and fa√ßades survived. In the 1960s the city magistrate planned to build a modern office building on the site. The then Minister of Economy in Hessen Rudi Arndt, earned the nickname \\"Dynamit-Rudi\\" (Dynamite Rudi) when he proposed to blow up \\"Germany's most beautiful ruin\\" with \\"a little dynamite\\". Arndt later said that this was not meant seriously. A citizen's initiative campaigned for reconstruction funds after 1953 and collected 15 million DM. It ended costing c. DM160, and the building was reopened on August 28, 1981, to the sounds of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 8, the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\". A live recording of that concert conducted by Michael Gielen is available on CD.

He served in several positions in the church and was a contemporary of Joseph Smith, and Brigham Young. Billings was a counselor in the first Bishopric of the Church to Edward Partridge. He participated in the Battle of Crooked River, and was a colonel in the Nauvoo Legion. He participated in the Mormon migration as a Captain of Fifty in the second company, and was a notable settler of Manti, Utah.  Early life  Billings was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, on March 24, 1793.Price, F. Lynn. \\"Every Person in the Doctrine and Covenants\\" 1997 pg. 17 , 9780882905976 He was the son of Ebeneezer Billings and Ester Joyce. One notable ancestor is Sir Thomas Billing, Chief Justice of the Kings Bench in England.  Cambellite commune  Titus and Diantha Morley Billings. On February 16, 1817, he married Diantha Morley. Diantha and her older brother Isaac Morley were members of Sidney Rigdon's congregation of Campbellites. This utopian group practiced communal principles, holding goods in common for the benefit of all of the members. They also held the belief, called Restorationism, that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the early Christian church as a model. These beliefs would serve as a backdrop for Billings's membership in the \\"Church of Christ\\", as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was first called, including his future participation in the United Order. When Sidney Rigdon joined the fledgling Church of Christ he held a two-hour sermon explaining to his congregation why he was making the commitment. The next morning, November 15, 1830, he was baptized.Rodney Stark, Roger Finke. \\"Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion\\" 2000 pg. 132-133 , Upon calling for more converts, Billings stepped forward and was the second person baptized in Kirtland, Ohio.Price, F. Lynn. \\"Every Person in the Doctrine and Covenants\\" 1997 pg. 17 , 9780882905976  Early church membership  In March 1831 Joseph Smith said he had received a revelation directing the Saints to impart of their land and money to the church.The Doctrine and Covenants, In August 1831 Billings was commanded to sell the Morley Family farm and holdings in preparation to move to Independence, Missouri.The Doctrine and Covenants, On March 10, 1832, he was ordained an elder by Thomas B Marsh.Pearson Harris Corbett. \\"Hyrum Smith, patriarch\\" 1963 Deseret Book Co. pg. 98 While en route to Jackson County, Missouri, he met with Joseph Smith on The Charleston, a steam packet in Louisville, Kentucky. The Billings family arrived in Clay County, Missouri, in May.Jenson, Andrew \\"The Historical record, Volumes 7-9\\" 1888 pg.403 While in Missouri, Billings participated in the United Order covenant which was made with Edward Partridge, the first bishop of the Church. The United Order was short-lived, though, and anti-Mormon pressure at the time caused Billings to lose much of his property. While storing hay on a rented farm owned by then Governor Boggs, a mob burned 24 tons of the hay and later forced Billings out of Clay County.Johnson, Clark V. \\"Mormon redress petitions: documents of the 1833-1838 Missouri conflict\\" Volume 16 of Religious Studies Center monograph series 1992 pg. 139-140 , In February 1835 Titus and Diantha were called to return to Kirtland to help finish the Kirtland temple. Titus was a stonemason, carpenter, and musician, while Diantha designed the original temple garments. In March, upon the temple‚Äôs completion, Diantha sang at the dedication services and Titus became a member of the School of the Prophets. The Billings family moved back to Missouri in 1837, and Titus was sustained as 2nd Councilor to Bishop Edward Partridge at the General Conference of the church in Far West.\\"The Latter-Day Saints' Millennial Star\\" 1852 pg. 449 He served in this calling until the death of Bishop Partridge in 1840.  Mob persecution  On October 25, 1838, Billings participated in the Battle of Crooked River, and as part of the aftermath was forced to flee from his home to the Des Moines River. While fleeing the mob he suffered from lack of food for several days and frostbite on his feet. As a result of the battle, Governor Boggs signed the infamous Extermination order. Billings signed a petition documenting the losses of property during this time which were never recovered. Escaping the mobs, he and his family moved to what became known as Morleytown or Yelrome, which is near modern-day Lima, Illinois, and is a short distance from Nauvoo, Illinois. In February 1841 the Nauvoo Legion was organized and Billings was made a captain. By September, Billings was promoted to the rank of colonel in the legion.Wells, Junius F. \\"The Contributor: representing the Young men's and Young ladies' mutual improvement associations of the Latter-day saints\\", Volume 9 1888 pg. 47 On August 22, 1842, Billings was called on a mission to the New England states. Luman Andros Shurtliff was his companion. They returned in June 1843 after suffering much and having only small successes.Shurtliff, Luman. Autobiography (1807-1847) \\"Biographical Sketch of the Life of Luman Andros Shurtliff,\\" http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/LShurtliff.html In September 1846, Isaac Morley's cooper shop was burned and the Billings family and all of the residents of Morleytown moved to Nauvoo. During this time Billings worked daily on the Nauvoo temple until its completion. However, due to mob pressure, their stay was short-lived, and after the death of Joseph Smith the Billings family and the saints moved out of Nauvoo. In 1848 Billings was appointed as a Captain of Fifty in Heber C Kimball‚Äôs company of pioneers.Jenson, Andrew \\"The Historical record, Volumes 7-9\\" 1888 pg. 902 The company arrived in Salt Lake Valley in the winter of 1848.

Upon completion of the survey, the settlers left their temporary shelters at Temple Hill and moved to their city lots. Billings and Jezreel Shomaker built the first houses, and were followed by others before the next winter.Lever W.H. \\"History of Sanpete and Emery counties, Utah : with sketches of cities, towns and villages, chronology of important events, records of Indian wars, portraits of prominent persons, and biographies of representative citizens\\" 1898 pg. 17 The Billings home still stands . Billings lived in Manti and was a member of the Stake presidency there in 1851. Initially the native tribes of the area were friendly towards the settlers while still at war with one another. When one tribe had a victory over another, often the women and children of the opposing tribe were taken as slaves. Upon seeing the cruel treatment of the newly enslaved children, the pioneers would sometimes purchase the children from their captors to liberate them. Titus Billings purchased a young Indian girl and gave her to Diantha to raise as a daughter. Diantha named the girl Rose Billings. After a few years the pioneers were able to convince the tribes that the Great Spirit was displeased with them for their cruelty to prisoners, and the practice gradually died out.Kimball, Solomon F. \\"Improvement era, Volume 11\\" 1908 pg. 738  Polygamy  On January 20, 1854, Titus married Mary Ann Tuttle as his second wife under the practice of polygamy. Mary Ann was the divorced ex-plural wife of Howard Egan. She bore four children with Titus before they too divorced.  Death  Billings' grave in Provo, Utah In his later years, Billings moved to Provo, Utah, and died there at the age of 72.

Its name means \\"Defense [from]\\" in Russian and others. The movement was established in 2005 and has no leader or centralized structure. Instead, it is based on the network principle and mostly horizontal relations. The movement opposes what they call an authoritarian vector of Russian policy. They claim that president Vladimir Putin destroys democracy institutions and aims to establish an authoritarian police state in Russia. The movement espouses nonviolent resistance to the authorities. The Moscow branch of Oborona has several hundred activists. The movement also has branches in 25 Russian cities. The movement has been widely inspired by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and especially the Ukrainian youth organizations Pora! and Znayu! as well as by Belarus Zubr. One of this organization leaders, Oleg Kozlovsky has been arrested, and, according to several oppositional sites illegally sent as a private conscript to the Russian Army.http://www.theotherrussia.org/2007/12/22/opposition-leader-conscripted- in-moscow-demonstrators- beaten/http://publiuspundit.com/2007/12/those_bastards.php Eight other members of the movement who tried to arrange demonstrations in support of Kozlovsky have been arrested as well, one of them daughter of writer and radio host Victor Shenderovich.

Indeed, he was released from the Army on March 4, 2008, two days after the elections. The military officials confirmed that his draft had been illegal. Symbolism During the 20th century, the image of a clenched fist, a symbol and gesture of resistance and unity was used by many movements, mostly of the left sense, such as: anarchists, anti-fascists, human rights activists, left-wing students, democrats, trade union movements, fighters for Indian rights, Black Panthers, green. All these people were united by the values of freedom and justice (in their understanding), the rejection of political reality and the readiness to defend their rights in practice. Structure Oborona has a network structure in which each regional organization retains significant autonomy, and horizontal links prevail over vertical ones. The largest regional organizations are managed by coordinating councils, others by coordinators.

It is a traditional form of tuna fishing or netting fence to catch tuna that is carried out in Italy (Mainly in Sicily and Sardinia), Morocco, Portugal (Mainly in the Algarve) and Spain (Mainly Andalusia, Murcia and Valencia).almadraba Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola, Vig√©sima segunda edici√≥n, Real Academia Espa√±ola, 2001.

It has gone through many iterations through the 20th century, culminating in the current building, which opened in 1993. History The original location of the municipal seat was on the block bound by King, Frederick, Duke and Scott streets and home today to Market Square Shopping Centre; the first city hall was built in 1919 by William Henry Eugene Schmalz (son of Mayor W.H. Schmalz) faced King, with the area towards Duke hosting the weekly Kitchener Farmer's Market (operating from 1869 to 1872 which relocated to building in rear), rebuilt 1907 and lasted until 1973. The last of the city halls on the site was built in 1924 replacing the Victorian structure topped with a clockless cupola (and with a Weather vane) with a three-story Renaissance Revival (similar to St. Lawrence Hall in Toronto) porticoed building topped with a clock tower. It was demolished in 1973 in a decision controversial to this day. The stones and workings of the clock tower were labelled and stored. While City Hall moved, the Farmer's Market was relocated within the same small location (in Market Square Mall) from 1973 to 2004. The Oxlea Tower was used for city offices starting in 1973.The city moved its offices across Frederick Street to the upper floors of the Oxlea office tower in 1973. Municipal affairs continued in leased space at this unremarkable location for the next twenty years; the former site was converted to the Market Square shopping centre, which housed the Farmers' Market below its parking garage. Victoria Park. The current City Hall building is visible in the background. The clock tower of the 1924 city hall was finally reassembled 22 years after being dismantled, and placed on a new base in Victoria Park in view of the new city hall, in 1995. Current building In the 1990s, during the mayoral term of Dom Cardillo, the city decided that it should operate from a dedicated, modern building again. It purchased the complete block enclosed by King, College, Duke, and Young streets, and held an architectural competition to design the building. The winner was Toronto architects Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (Mertins & Wright, 1990) who laid out an open square facing King Street complete with a fountain/skating rink. The design plans for the building are kept at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal.Canadian Centre for Architecture. \\"Kitchener City Hall Competition, Ontario (1989-1993)\\". www.cca.qc.ca. Retrieved 2020-06-23. The Kitchener City Hall is enclosed on two sides by three-storey wings, with the main building at the back of the square. The west side of the edifice houses the council chamber; a central, open rotunda defines an indoor public space, and the east elevation consists of a twelve- storey office tower. The parts of the building are named for former names of Kitchener; the wings surrounding the square are named for Sandhills and Ebytown, while the Berlin Tower carries the most recent of the former names. The square at front was simply named Civic Square for its first 21 years; it was renamed Carl Zehr Square in late 2014, in honour of the mayor who retired that year. Gardens and other open space face Duke Street at the rear. The new City Hall opened with generally enthusiastic support in 1993. The textures of the building are varied. Much of both the interior and exterior is in red sandstone imported from India; domestic granite makes up pavement and floors. A unique feature is the 'green wall'; passing from the south on a parallel with Gaukel Street, this bulwark of green stone continues, at various heights, through the square and building across the entire block. The council chamber is a modern, approachable space, where the mayor and councillors sit at a circular furnishing, surrounded by staff facilities and observed by the visitors' gallery. The building's rotunda hosts many events, from art exhibits to public gatherings. Popular culture The city hall makes appearances in the sitcom Dan for Mayor as the Wessex City Hall. It is well-known for being featured in the film RoboCop 2. Cenotaph A cenotaph was built at Frederick Street near King Street in 1929, relocated near City Hall in 1949 and relocated to current site at Duke and Frederick Streets in 1973.https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7073478-kitchener-plans-to-upgrade- cenotaph-site/ Sources *City of Kitchener - historic attractions References *Mertins, D. and Wright, V. editors(1990).

The film adheres more closely to the original play upon which it is based ‚Äì Patrick Hamilton's Gas Light (1938) ‚Äì than the 1944 MGM remake. The play had been performed on Broadway as Angel Street, so when the MGM remake was released in the United States, it was given the same title as the American production. Plot Set in Pimlico, London, Alice Barlow (Marie Wright) is murdered by an unknown man, who then ransacks her house, looking for her valuable rubies. The house remains empty for many years, until newlyweds Paul and Bella Mallen move in. Bella (Diana Wynyard) soon finds herself misplacing small objects; and, before long, Paul (Anton Walbrook) has her believing she is losing her sanity. B. G. Rough (Frank Pettingell), a former detective involved in the original murder investigation, immediately suspects him of Alice Barlow's murder. Paul lights the gas lamps to search the closed-off upper floors, which causes the rest of the lamps in the house to dim slightly. When Bella comments on the lights' dimming, he tells her that she is imagining things. Bella is persuaded that she is hearing noises, unaware that Paul enters the upper floors from the house next door. The sinister interpretation of the change in light levels is part of a larger pattern of deception to which Bella is subjected. It is revealed that Paul is a bigamist. He is the wanted Louis Bauer, who has returned to the house to search for the rubies he was unable to find after the murder.

Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 1/2 stars (out of 4): \\"Electrifying atmosphere, delicious performances, and a succinctly conveyed sense of madness and evil lurking beneath the surface of the ordinary\\". The Time Out critic wrote, \\"Nothing like as lavish as the later MGM version ... But in its own small-scale way a superior film by far. Lurking menace hangs in the air like a fog, the atmosphere is electric, and Wynyard suffers exquisitely as she struggles to keep dementia at bay.\\" Encouraged by the success of the play and film, MGM bought the remake rights, but with a clause insisting that all existing prints of Dickinson's version be destroyed, even to the point of trying to destroy the negative, so that it would not compete with their more highly publicised 1944 remake starring Charles Boyer, Ingrid Bergman, and Joseph Cotten.Fristoe, Roger. \\"Gaslight (1940)\\" on TCM.com \\"Fortunately they failed, and now the British film has been restored by the BFI and issued in the UK on Blu-ray in a pristine print.\\" Gaslight as expression The psychological term gaslighting, which describes a form of psychological abuse in which the victim is gradually manipulated into doubting his or her own reality, originated from the play and its two film adaptations. Gaslighting means emotionally manipulating others by undermining their confidence and calling their credibility into question. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Vermilye, Jerry.

Angel began his career in New York City, before moving his base of operations to the Las Vegas Valley. He is known for starring in the television and stage show Criss Angel Mindfreak and his previous live performance illusion show Criss Angel Believe in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil at the Luxor casino in Las Vegas. The show generated $150 million in tourist revenue to Las Vegas in 2010, but has since been replaced by Mindfreak LIVE! on 11 May 2016 (the show is partly produced by Cirque du Soleil; however, the directive rights are entirely with Criss Angel). He also starred in the television series Criss Angel BeLIEve on Spike TV, the reality-competition television show Phenomenon on NBC, and the 2014 stage show Criss Angel Magicjam. Angel has been on prime time television for more hours than any other magician in history, between his television series and various specials on cable and network television. He also holds multiple world records made during his magic performances, and was named Magician of the Decade in 2009 and Magician of the Century in 2010 by the International Magicians Society. In addition to his career as an illusionist, Angel was the lead singer for his industrial band Angeldust, which released five albums between 1998 and 2003. He also authored the book Mindfreak: Secret Revelations. Early life Criss Angel was born on December 19, 1967, at Hempstead General Hospital in Hempstead, on Long Island, New York. He is of Greek descent. Angel was raised in Elmont until fourth grade, when his family moved to East Meadow, New York. His father, John Sarantakos, owned a restaurant and doughnut shop. He developed an interest in magic at age 7 and performed his first show at age 12, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was Harry Houdini. By age 14, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float in their family den. Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host Marc Morrone, who helped Angel find and train a set of doves for his act. By the time he graduated from East Meadow High School, he had decided to pursue a career as a professional magician instead of attending college as his parents wanted. According to the Biography Channel, \\"Angel hit the road and began touring with other traveling performance acts. Between traveling and performing, he attempted to further his education in his own by studying the history of magic in public libraries. He also studied the art of mysticism, music, martial arts and even dance.\\" Early career Angel has said that, \\"I stayed away from magicians when I was younger because I didn't want to think like them and wanted to create my own style.\\" His first television appearance was in 1994, where he performed as a part of a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, \\"Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can't come quickly enough.\\" During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Illusions in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a 10-minute show over the course of the \\"World of Illusion\\" conference in Madison Square Garden, performing 60 shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website. Angel also starred in the 1997 television movie The Science of Magic and its 2003 sequel The Science of Magic II. Criss Angel Mindfreak, which would later become Angel's first television series, was originally an off- Broadway show by Angel, which in 2001 was picked up by the World Underground Theatre. When not performing the show, Angel worked the streets promoting the show to pedestrians. Criss Angel Mindfreak ran for more than 600 performances between 2001 and 2003 at the World Underground Theater in Times Square. His 24 hours in a tank of water set a world record for the longest amount of time for a human to be completely submerged under water. This performance would also become a part of his first television special. Angel has also been known to actively discourage a belief in mediumship, stating that there is no way for mediums to speak with people beyond the dead. He has said, \\"If somebody's doing that for entertainment purposes, that's one thing. But if they claim to be communicating with the dead, I don't care if they're from my hometown, I don't care if they're my family members: I'll expose them and tell them what they really are.\\" =Water torture cell in Times Square, 2002= In August 2002, Angel spent 24 hours shackled underwater in a phone booth-sized water torture cell near the WWE entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being the owners of the World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for the trick, he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in East Meadow, New York. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance to make it through the period without need to exit and use the bathroom. During the trick, he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After the trick, he was required to remove his own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water. At the end of the performance, according to Ted Shaffrey, \\"Before he emerged from the phone- booth sized contraption of clear plastic and steel, Angel yanked out the air hose that allowed him to breathe. Then assistants pulled a black curtain over the 220-gallon (832-liter) chamber to block the view of television cameras and about 100 people gathered outside the window in which he was displayed. Under cover, Angel apparently escaped from the shackles that bound his arms, legs and neck, before pulling himself from the watery chamber with a celebratory scream.\\" Upon successfully completing the trick, he was described as having \\"skin crinkled and his eyes bloodshot\\", and upon emerging from the tank he was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and treated for severe dehydration. He reported afterwards that he had suffered from overheating, jaw fatigue, and semi- consciousness while in the tank. Television specials and promotional appearances (2002-2005) On October 20, 2002, Angel performed in the ABC Family television special named Criss Angel Mindfreak: Postmodern illusionist, an hour-long performance and tribute to Harry Houdini. The special aired again on December 24, 2002 on Channel 4 in the U.K. The Birmingham Evening Mail reviewed the show, writing, \\"Criss Angel is currently making a name for himself as a more provocative, darker alternative to [other illusionists]. He walks the streets of New York, hypnotising passers-by, turning cups of take- away coffee into cockroaches and suspending himself from the ceiling by inserting hooks into his back. The piece de resistance of all these mind games is an update of the Houdini underwater trick - an attempt to stay in a (cell) tank of water for 24 hours, padlocked and restrained. All seems to be going well, until the filter system breaks down and the water begins to heat up.\\" On October 31, 2003, the SciFi Channel aired the one-hour special Supernatural starring Angel. Kate O'Hare said of the special that, \\"Filmed in part at Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., \\"Supernatural\\" finds Angel crawling up buildings, passing a quarter through his skin, spontaneously combusting and having otherworldly creatures burst from his chest.\\" When asked about his process in creating television specials, Angel said that, \\"I like to have my hand in everything on my TV specials. I'm the executive producer; I direct it; I create it. I write all the music for my TV specials and my live performances. It's on my label. I write it; I produce it.\\" During the special Angel performed stunts, including lighting himself on fire and making a tarantula emerge from a pedestrian's soda can. In 2003, Angel was also featured in the two-hour TBS special Made in Japan. In early 2003, Angel performed at the release of the new branding for Miller Lite beer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the 80th anniversary of Houdini's last performance in that city. For the performance, he was suspended ten stories in the air and bound in a straitjacket, from which he escaped. He also performed an illusion at Ozzfest in 2005. During this period Angel also earned money selling signed merchandise, making up to $50,000 a day. Criss Angel Mindfreak television series In 2005, Angel became the creator, director, and executive producer of the A&E; Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying on a bed of broken glass. The first season of the show was released on DVD after it completed its on-screen run. The show also released its Halloween special, along with two special episodes, on an additional one-disc DVD offering. The show returned for a second season in May 2006, and was named one of the best shows of the summer by the Tulsa World newspaper. The show was renewed for a third season in July 2006; as of that third season the show was A&E;'s number one rated show, with more than 1.5 million viewers. That year he promoted the show with a performance where he was suspended within a cube encased in concrete above Times Square, escaping from the block before it was set to crash to the ground. Magic effects creator Sean Field stated of Angel this year that, \\"Criss Angel is the biggest name in magic since Houdini ... No other magician has invaded pop culture to the degree that Criss Angel has. He has changed the image of magic and made it cool.\\" The show became one of the most popular foreign television shows in parts of Asia, including China. The television show was noted as a part of the mid-2000s films, television, and books that drove a resurgence of the public popularity of magic. Criss Angel Mindfreak was the first weekly magic television show to air in 40 years. Daily Variety reviewed the premiere writing, \\"The stunts alone are impressive. But what makes the show fascinating are the down-home touches in which we see the kid from New York, who first honed his magic skills at the age of 6. Keenly aware of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved. Viewers follow the illusionist as he contemplates new and more dangerous stunts, while his crew, including his often-fretful brothers, offer insight as to what, other than ego, drives someone in this profession.\\" The show ran from 2005 until 2010, at which point he had been featured for more hours on prime time television than any other magician in history. Other tricks performed in the show included making an elephant disappear and the performance of s√©ances, as well as other tricks in order to teach his audience about con men and how to avoid scams intended to manipulate money out of people. In July 2008, Angel escaped from a beachside hotel before its demolition in front of a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was four minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building. Criss Angel Believe=Stage show= Angel performing in front of a live crowd In 2006, Angel partnered with Cirque du Soleil to produce the stage show Criss Angel Believe (stylized as \\"Criss Angel BeLIEve\\"), premiering the show at the Luxor Las Vegas on September 26, 2008. It became the bestselling live magic show in the world. The name of the show was taken from Harry Houdini, for the mythology of Houdini choosing the word \\"believe\\" as the codeword for communicating with Houdini after his death. Luxor's parent company, MGM Mirage, financed the show with $100 million. After several delays, the show was set for a gala opening on October 31, 2008, with preview shows in late September on the 82nd anniversary of Harry Houdini's death. The initial preview received mixed reactions and reviews. Reporters for the Las Vegas Sun, Los Angeles Times, and Las Vegas Review Journal cited a lack of the magic Angel is known for, as well as a confusing and uninteresting theme. They also opined that neither Angel nor Cirque du Soleil were able to perform to their capabilities during these initial performances. On the positive side, the Las Vegas Sun later quoted Star Pulse, stating, \\"He has created a live show that is everything a perfect magic performance should be ‚Äî and then some. It's not just remarkable magic ‚Äî it's transcendent art that won't just blow your mind; it will quite possibly change your life.\\" In April 2009, Angel ended a performance of Believe by \\"hurling obscene insults\\" at blogger Perez Hilton, an audience member. Hilton reportedly had texted to his fans during the performance that the show was \\"unbelievably BAD\\" and that he'd \\"rather be getting a root canal\\", and word had gotten back to Angel by the end of the performance. Cirque du Soleil later apologized to Hilton for Angel's remarks. In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, after being unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had improved by reducing the narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: \\"The show is easily the most exciting thing now on stage in Vegas!\\" That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a 10-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013. =Television series= The stage show celebrated its fifth anniversary of appearing on stage in October 2013. That month a cable television series based upon the show entitled Criss Angel BeLIEve was broadcast on Spike TV. The first season included 11 one-hour episodes, including 118 different illusions. Guests on the show include Ludacris, Ice-T, Randy Couture and Shaquille O'Neal. When asked about the three years between the last episode of Mindfreak and his return to television, Angel stated that, \\"I didn't take long at all to go back to television. It was my choice to work on the live Cirque show and to get that where I wanted it to be. \\"Now that that show is just humming and doing amazing business ‚Äî it's the #1 bestselling magic show in the world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times ‚Äî I felt it was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, \\"Believe\\" will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I'm always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it.\\" Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the \\"most- watched new original series [on Spike TV] in more than 18 months\\" according to The Hollywood Reporter. In the episode \\"Lord of Illusions ‚Äî Death Premonition\\", Angel paid homage to Clive Barker, the director of the horror movie of the same name. In the episode, Angel performed the closing stunt from the film, in which he laid beneath a circle of suspended swords, and predicted the correct order of six falling swords to avoid becoming stabbed through his body after their release. The swords were selected by the audience with the help of a randomly bouncing ball. According to the Las Vegas Sun, \\"Criss is the only, and first, magician in the world granted permission from the inventor and filmmaker to re-create the film's death-defying stunt.\\" For another episode for the series filmed in New York City he was asked by the NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel performances had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips in the history of the site, with more than 15 million views. In the show, Angel revealed the secrets behind some of his illusions to the audience. This included the \\"Lord of Illusions\\" trick, where he revealed that he had the swords in a preset order so that he could avoid them. The episode featuring this illusion also includes a meeting between Angel and his team discussing a problem with the trick and how to ensure it does not happen again. Phenomenon Starting in October 2007, he appeared as a judge on Phenomenon with Uri Geller. In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King \\"no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I was going to do with Phenomenon. If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust [him] live and on television.\\" On the October 31, 2007 episode of the reality show Phenomenon, paranormalist Jim Callahan performed a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover the contents of a locked box. Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it \\"comical\\" and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an \\"ideological bigot\\", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, \\"Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending...\\" Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, \\"I guess this is a 'no,'\\" and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers \\"911\\" printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: \\"If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives\\". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak. Stage shows=Criss Angel Magicjam= The temporary replacement show for Believe was entitled Criss Angel Magicjam, which was performed in the same Luxor theatre. According to the Las Vegas Sun, the show included, \\"Longtime Las Vegas comedy-illusionist Nathan Burton; Banachek, the world's premiere mentalist; and new female magician Krystyn Lambert, who has been prominently featured in the Spike series ... joined by grandmaster manipulators Jason Byrne and Tony Clarke, supreme close-up artist Armando Vera and the magic comedy of Russ Merlin.\\" The production was written and directed by Criss Angel. In January 2014, Angel announced that he planned on taking Criss Angel Magicjam on a North American tour during the summer of 2014. The show also featured Angel's own illusions, which he performed for about 40 minutes of the show. Robin Leach said of the show that, \\"Magicjam is great fun and a high- energy show packed with mind-blowing magic.\\" =Mindfreak LIVE!= In 2014, Angel premiered the stage show Mindfreak LIVE! The touring show features illusions from Angel himself, which received positive reviews. The demonstrations used in the show were developed in Angel's illusion laboratory in Las Vegas, located in a 60,000 square foot warehouse. His international touring with the show marked the first time that Angel had traveled with his show in about six years. The premiere show of the performance occurred at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut during November 2014. =The Supernaturalists= The Supernaturalists premiered in June 2015 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino's The Fox Theater, with Angel serving as creator, director and executive producer. Performers for the show include illusionist Landon Swank, magician Krystyn Lambert, escape artist Spencer Horsman, mentalist Banachek, dog conjuror Johnny Dominguez, magician Stefan, and close up magician Adrian Vega. Robin Leach reviewed the show as having \\"overwhelming positive reactions\\" and wrote that it contained \\"the most mind-blowing magic spectacle that's playing anywhere\\". Angel has stated that the show is a culmination of ten years of development, which he began in 2005, and is intended as a global touring show and as a premiering venue for several new illusions from each magician. Variety show appearances and guest spots Angel has made numerous special television guest appearances on WWE Raw, including acting as guest star on March 8, 2010. He also appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, including the premiere episode of its 24th season. During a 2007 episode of the show, he successfully guessed the number between 1 and 100 he asked Winfrey to think of without telling him. Angel has appeared on other talk shows including The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Megan Mullally Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, AVN Awards Show 2007 and Larry King Live on CNN. He was also a guest on The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman, America's Got Talent, and The Rosie O'Donnell Show. He also made a guest acting appearance on the hit television shows CSI: NY, Las Vegas and Rules of Engagement. In 2011, Angel also appeared in an Orville Redenbacher Pop-Up Bowl popcorn commercial. In May 2005, Angel introduced honoree Ozzy Osbourne at the VH1 Rock Honors awards, biting the head off a bat as a part of the introduction in homage to Osbourne's early career onstage antics. At the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, Angel performed an illusion as a part of the musical performance by Britney Spears and helped to plan her stage show, which opened the television broadcast. He was also hired as the illusionist for the planned 2009 Michael Jackson O2 arena concerts before Jackson's death. In 2013, Angel had a cameo in the feature film The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, and Jim Carrey's character in the movie \\"Steve Gray\\" has been said to be modeled after Angel. There is a wax statue of Angel in the Madame Tussauds wax museum in Las Vegas. Other projects Angel (left) with Tommy Lee =Music= Angel has a passion for music and claims to have been a musician longer than a magician. In 1989 he fronted the short-lived heavy metal band Angel and produced a promotional music video for the song \\"Don't You Want My Love\\", incorporating several magic tricks. Angel later went on to collaborate with industrial rock musician Klay Scott for a new band titled Angeldust in 1995. Angeldust released its debut album Musical Conjurings From the World of Illusion in 1998. He later released the albums System 1, System 2, and System 3. In 2003, he released the album Supernatural. His musical style continues to be in the heavy metal style, though when describing his musical style he has said, \\"There are elements where it's more electronic, and there are orchestrated sections. I decided to take it in different places because I'm inspired by emotion and by giving people a connection, a sense of a feeling ‚Äî whether it's excitement or crying or being happy.\\" He also produced soundtracks for his television series Mindfreak, including collaborations with members of Korn and Godsmack. =Books= Angel is the author of the book Mindfreak: Secret Revelations, published by HarperEntertainment in 2007. Mindfreak: Secret Revelations appeared on the Los Angeles Times bestseller list that year. According to the Las Vegas Sun, \\"The 295-page book details the early beginnings of his career, memorable demonstrations from his TV show and personal reflections. \\"Secret Revelations\\" also contains several pictures and provides step-by-step instructions for 40 of his basic Mindfreaks. Laura Morton helped the magician write the book.\\" California Bookwatch wrote that it \\"tells of Criss Angel's evolution as a performance artist, magician and musician, charting his rise to fame beginning at age 6 and adding details of his life and his artistic philosophy and influences ... His survey covers the 'Mindfreaks' which allow him to push for excellence in very different worlds\\". =Internet= Criss Angel is the most watched magician in Internet history since the late 2000s. His clip, \\"Walk on Water\\", had received more than 39 million views by 2010, and more than 46 million by 2013. By early 2013, his videos had achieved more than 200 million views. Another highly watched clip is \\"Rip Bodies Apart\\" taken from the premiere episode of BeLIEve, which had more than twelve million views within a month. =Toys= In 2010, Angel partnered with IdeaVillage to release the Criss Angel Magic Collection, which contained six Mindfreak Magic Tricks instructions, 250 tricks, and a magic kit for children. The product was backed by $50 million in marketing. Recognition=Awards= Angel won the International Magician Society's Magician of the Year award in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008, in addition to its \\"Magician of the Decade\\" title in 2009 and \\"Magician of the Century\\" title in 2010. He was the 22nd recipient of the Louie Award for outstanding achievement in the art of magic. He has also appeared on the covers of Magic and Genii magazines. In 2008, Angel was one of the inaugural nominees for the Harry Houdini Award, awarded by the Harry Houdini Museum. Angel is the youngest magician to ever be inducted into the International Magician Society's Magic Hall of Fame. He is also the only man to have won the Merlin Magician of the Year award on two occasions, in 2001 and 2004. In 2011, he was awarded the World Magic Legacy Awards' Living Legend award. On July 20, 2017, Angel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located next to The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. =World records= Angel is the holder of several world records, including the longest time submerged under water and the fastest time to escape from a straitjacket at two minutes and 30 seconds, the longest body suspension at five hours 42 minutes, and the fastest time to perform the \\"Metamorphosis\\" illusion at less than one second. He is also the holder of the Guinness world record for \\"The most people to disappear in an illusion\\", for making 100 people disappear on May 26, 2010 during a performance of Believe at the Luxor. Personal life In 2002, Angel married his longtime girlfriend JoAnn Winkhart. The couple filed for divorce four years later. Although Angel was seen with his wife in the buried alive illusion (season 1, episode 6, 2005) and the body suspension illusion (season 1, episode 5, 2005), she was not credited as his wife; rather, she was listed as \\"Criss's Girl\\". In November 2008, Angel began dating Holly Madison, former girlfriend of Hugh Hefner. The relationship ended in February 2009.\\"Holly Madison and Criss Angel Kaput\\", Yahoo News, February 25, 2009. He proposed to Sandra Gonzalez on September 7, 2011 in Cabo San Lucas during a sunset dinner.Johnson, James. \\"Illusionist Criss Angel Proposes To Sandra Gonzalez\\", Inquisitr.com, September 20, 2011. They broke up shortly after. Since 2012, Angel has been dating Australian singer Shaunyl Benson. The couple have two sons together, Johnny Christopher, born 2014, and Xristos Yanni, born January 22, 2019. \\"Shaunyl & I are so blessed with a beautiful healthy baby boy - Born: Xristos Yanni /January 22, 2019... As of 2010, Big Bear Choppers had produced seven custom-made motorcycles for Angel, who featured the motorcycle designers on his show Criss Angel Mindfreak. He also had a Harley Davidson motorcycle built by Orange County Choppers, which he rode in the intro filmed for Criss Angel Mindfreak. As a philanthropist, Angel created the Believe Foundation 'Believe Anything is Possible', and was awarded the Make-A-Wish Foundation award for most supportive celebrity on May 19, 2010. He was also awarded the foundation's Chris Greicius Celebrity Award in 2007. As of 2016, Angel's business interests made about $70 million in revenues annually.

Dynamic currency conversion (DCC) or cardholder preferred currency (CPC) is a process whereby the amount of a Visa or MasterCard transaction is converted by a merchant or ATM to the currency of the payment card's country of issue at the point of sale. DCC allows the merchant, merchant's bank or ATM operator to charge a markup on the exchange rate used, sometimes by as much as 18%. Where the DCC markup is less than the card issuer's currency conversion fee, DCC can benefit card holders by allowing them to see the amount that their card will be charged expressed in the currency of the card's country of issue. However, in most cases, DCC markups are higher than the card issuer's currency conversion fee (which can be zero), thereby negating this benefit. DCC services are generally provided by third party operators in association with the merchant, and not by a card issuer. Card issuers do not provide cardholders with a DCC option at the point of sale, but these two card networks permit DCC operators to offer currency conversion in accordance with their card processing rules.https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-international- operating-regulations- main.pdfhttp://www.mastercard.com/elearning/dcc/docs/DCC%20Guide%2020.02.17%20EN.pdf Without DCC, the currency conversion is carried out by the card issuer when the transaction is charged to the card holder's statement, usually a day or two later, but for an increasing number of cards in real time. Even though the card issuer will publish the exchange rate used for conversion on the statement, most do not disclose the exchange rate used to convert a transaction at the time of payment. Both Visa and MasterCard state that the rates they publish in advance of a transaction posting to a cardholder's statement are indicative, since the rates they use for conversion correspond to the date and time they process the transaction, as opposed to the actual transaction date. With DCC, the currency conversion is done by the merchant or their bank at the point of sale. Unlike a credit card company, a DCC operator must disclose the exchange rate used for conversion at the time of the transaction according to credit card company rules which govern how DCC is offered. The DCC exchange rate must be based on a wholesale interbank rate, to which any additional markup is then applied. Visa requires that this markup be disclosed to the cardholder. The credit card company may still charge an additional fee for charges made outside the card holder's home country, even when the transaction has been processed in their home currency with DCC. Proponents of this service believe that customers can better understand prices in their home currency, and this makes it easier for business travelers to keep track of their expenses. They also point out that the customer has full transparency inclusive of conversion fees, and can make an informed choice whether or not to use DCC. The financial benefit to the merchant or their card processor may be an incentive for the merchant to offer DCC even when it would be disadvantageous to the customer. Opponents of the service believe that customers do not understand DCC, and point out that DCC exchange rate markups are mostly higher than the card issuers' currency conversion fees that DCC avoids, and therefore, in almost all cases, opting for DCC will result in a higher charge to the cardholder. Due to the strategic threat posed by DCC on Visa's core revenues, in 2010 Visa attempted to ban DCC - The Australian federal courts found that Visa acted anti-competitively in order to protect its own revenues and was fined $20 million. History A dynamic currency conversion service was offered in 1996 and commercialized by a number of companies including Monex Financial ServicesMonex Financial Services - Dynamic currency conversion and FEXCO. Prior to the card schemes (Visa and MasterCard) imposing rules relating to DCC, cardholder transactions were converted without the need to disclose that the transaction was being converted into a customer's home currency, in a process known as \\"back office DCC\\". Visa and MasterCard now prohibit this practice and require the customer's consent for DCC, although many travelers have reported that this is not universally followed. Visa Chargeback reason code 76 explicitly covers situations where the \\"Cardholder was not advised that Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) would occur\\" or \\"Cardholder was refused the choice of paying in the merchant‚Äôs local currency\\". Customers have a strong chance of successfully disputing such transactions, especially in situations where they pay with a credit card and where Verified by Visa or Securecode is not involved. Mastercard DCC Compliance team investigates the case and then notifies the Acquirer of their findings. If appropriate, the Acquirer will also be asked to take action to remedy the complaint. MasterCard take seriously any complaint from a customer by investigating the case for compliance with DCC rules, and if the customer was not given a choice in a DCC transaction, the customer's bank has the possibility to refund the customer with a chargeback sent to the merchant's bank. How it works DCC is only available at merchants that have signed up for the facility with a DCC provider. When a customer is ready to pay for a transaction and chooses to pay with a payment card, the point-of-sale terminal of a DCC merchant will determine the card's country of issue from the card's issuer identification number (first 6 digits of the card number). If it detects a foreign card is being used, then the transaction will be routed through the DCC provider, which may offer DCC to the customer. If DCC is being offered, the terminal will also display the transaction amount in the customer's home currency. Visa and MasterCard require the DCC provider to disclose the exchange rate and margin to the cardholder, but not all merchants comply with this obligation, and other card issuers do not have that obligation. The cardholder can then select whether the transaction is to be processed in the local or home currency. If the cardholder chooses to pay in their home currency, the DCC provider will cause the cardholder's account to be debited by the transaction amount in the home currency, and the merchant's account to be credited with the amount in the local currency. At regular periods, usually monthly, the merchant would also be credited with the commission for DCC transactions. The exchange rate risk is borne by the DCC provider, which may carry that risk or set up some hedging arrangement to minimise or transfer that risk. Some card issuers impose an additional foreign transaction fee on DCC transactions, even though they are denominated in the card's home currency. =Practical example= An example of the difference with DCC can be seen in the following image, where the same GBP purchase is made twice just after each other: one with DCC and one without DCC. In both cases, the original amount is GB¬£6.90 and is paid with a Visa card denominated in EUR. File:dcc versus non dcc.png The difference in charges can be seen on the customer's card statement. With DCC (left part of the above image), the amount becomes EUR 8.20, at an exchange rate of 1.1882. The DCC provider, in this example the merchant itself, also disclosed that it is using the Reuters Wholesale Interbank exchange rate plus 2.95%. Without DCC, the amount can vary with fluctuations between the GBP and EUR currencies, but on the date of this transaction it was EUR 8.04. In this example, difference is just over 2%. Though this difference may seem a small amount for the customer, it can result in a big income stream for the DCC provider and merchant. One should also realise that even without DCC the card issuer converts the transaction amount using its own exchange rates and margins, which in this example was 1.16522. 830px =Limitations= The merchant's point-of-sale terminal can only detect the card's country of issue and not the currency of the account that is to be selected. The DCC makes an assumption that the account home currency is the currency of the card's country of issue. This assumption can result in DCC being offered incorrectly. For example, a DCC-enabled terminal in the Eurozone will offer DCC to a customer paying with a debit card issued in the United Kingdom on a euro bank account. If the customer mistakenly chooses DCC, then the transaction will first be converted from EUR to GBP by the DCC provider, and then from GBP back to EUR by the UK card issuer, often with its markup. There have reported cases of point-of-sale terminals allowing merchants to change the transaction amount and currency after the cardholder has entered their PIN and handed the terminal back to the merchant. In this scenario, DCC is carried out without the cardholder's consent, even though the receipt subsequently printed states falsely that the cardholder has given their consent. DCC on the Internet and ATMs DCC operates similarly with Internet transactions. When payment card information is entered to finalize payment, the system can detect the home country of the cardholder and offer the cardholder the option of paying in their home currency. Many commercial websites can detect the country from which a query has come and quote prices in terms of the enquirer's country. Often the prices in the local currency of the supplier are not indicated, and the exchange rate used to convert prices is often also not disclosed. VISA issued a rule making DCC available for cash withdrawals at ATMs as of 13 April 2019. Mastercard now does the same. In the VISA example, when DCC is NOT chosen, VISA converts currency at the wholesale (!) rate and adds a 1% charge for performing the conversion. The customer gets the \\"real\\" exchange rate (no commission) unless the card issuer adds a charge for international transactions. American banks, for example, often charge 3%, even though the debit order they receive is already presented for collection in US dollars. Some banks and other issuers make no extra charge, so the full international transaction cost is just the 1%. When DCC is applied, the alternate companies do the exchange and add the commissions described above, which have no limit. The bank card company, such as VISA, still takes its 1%. VISA rule 5.9.8.3 of 13 April 2019 says that ATM customers must be given a clear CHOICE whether to use DCC or not: \\"A Merchant or ATM Acquirer that offers Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) must comply with all of the following: . . . \\"5 Acceptance \\"-- Inform the Cardholder that DCC is optional and not use any language or procedures that may cause the Cardholder to choose DCC by default \\"-- Ensure that the Cardholder is given all the relevant information to allow them to make a clear and transparent decision to expressly agree to a DCC Transaction\\" The reality is otherwise. The screen on an ATM announces the exchange rate that will be used and asks whether the customer accepts or refuses that rate. It appears to be \\"take it or leave it.\\" There is NO explanation that refusal will not end the transaction, but rather means the exchange will be done without charging the commission. The clear \\"choice\\" required by the rule is not presented. In addition, there is usually very small type giving the % of the commission and saying this is not an additional charge (which is false). On some screens there will be advice to be sure to know the rules, but no way is provided to learn the rules and bank tellers are generally unaware of them. Impact DCC has proved popular with merchants because it enables them to profit from the foreign exchange conversion that occurs during the payment process for a foreign denominated credit card.Yang, Maximilian, 'Dynamic Currency Conversion ‚Äì ein grenz√ºberschreitendes verbraucherpolitisches Problem' (Dynamic Currency Conversion ‚Äì a cross-border consumer policy problem), [2015] BKR 407, 408 (in German), with further references. Credit card acquirers and payment gateways will also take a profit on the foreign exchange conversion that occurs during the payment process for foreign denominated credit card when DCC is used. DCC revenue has been important for them because it offsets increasing international interchange fees. =Advantages= The main advantage of DCC is that for a non-DCC transaction the customer does not know exactly the exchange rate that the credit card company will apply (and the final cost) until the transaction is cleared, so the actual rate is not known to the customer until it appears on a monthly statement. Other advantages to customers, according to proponents, are: * the ability to view and therefore understand prices in foreign countries in their home currency, * the ability to enter expenses more efficiently and promptly, especially for business travellers, and * EU regulation 2560/2001 could make non-eurozone cash withdrawals within the European Economic Area cheaper for eurozone customers because euro cash withdrawals are regulated. A Swedish law (SFS 2002:598) combined with the EU resolution does the same thing for Swedish cards if the transaction is in SEK or EUR. Generally, Eurozone banks charge a fixed fee for non-EEA and non-EUR cash withdrawals while EEA withdrawals in EUR are free of charge. For example, if a Eurozone card is used for a withdrawal in the UK, with DCC there are two options - processing the transaction in GBP (card issuer's exchange rate but a fixed cash withdrawal fee) or processing the transaction in EUR (DCC marked-up exchange rate but no fixed cash withdrawal fee). For small amounts, the latter option will often be cheaper. For the merchant which normally accepts credit cards, DCC offers an opportunity to earn a margin on the transaction with no exchange rate risk, which is borne by the DCC operator. =Disadvantages= The main objection to DCC is the unfavorable exchange rates and fees being applied on the transaction, resulting in a higher charge on their credit card, and that in many cases the customer is not aware of the additional and often unnecessary cost of the DCC transaction. The size of the foreign exchange margin added using DCC varies depending on the DCC operator, card acquirer or payment gateway and merchant. This margin is in addition to any charges levied by the customer's bank or credit card company for a foreign purchase. In most cases, customers are charged more using DCC than they would have been if they had simply paid in the foreign currency. Regulatory issues In May 2010 Visa Inc attempted to ban DCC on its network citing strategic issues and ultimately (as described by the ACCC) significant financial losses to its business. Many protests were made by merchants, financial institutions, and regulators. In 2015, Visa was fined approximately 18 million plus $2 million in costs for engaging in anti-competitive conduct, in proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The action was taken after Visa partially blocked the use of DCC 1 May 2010 to 6 October 2010.

These traditionally include: # A prohibition against partition of property for a limited time. # The right of first refusal ‚Äì for example, if Joey sells property to Rachel, he may require that if Rachel later decides to sell the property, she must first give Joey the opportunity to buy it back. # The establishment of public parks and gardens, as was the case for The Royal Parks of London in the UK. These public spaces were created under such terms by the Crown Estate; which meant that these parks were held in perpetuity for the public to use. Some specific restraints on alienation in the United States include: ;Disabling restraints : To be effective the grantor must sue the grantee for enforcement. The effectiveness of the lawsuit could prevent the transfer from being made. In addition, if the disabling restraint is found to be unconstitutional the restraint will not be effective. ;Promissory restraints : If the promissory note is breached by the grantee, the grantor may sue for damages. Unlike disabling restraints, the effectiveness of the lawsuit does not prevent the transfer from being made. However, the Supreme Court says promissory restraints are not permissible. The promissory note discourages the person getting ready to sell the property which is the same effect as the disabling restraint. ;Forfeiture restraints : In the event of a breach the property returns to the grantor or the grantor's heirs. The return happens automatically, hence the argument can be made that there is no state actions. However, according to a constitutional argument the mere fact that the state recognizes the validity of an automatic transfer makes it a state action. To be effective the restraint must be reasonable and the restraint must be the same as a real covenant or equitable servitude. There are six factors to determine if a restraint on alienation is reasonable: # Type of price (fixed or not fixed; courts prefer non-fixed) # Purpose: Is it a legitimate purpose, or not? (courts prefer legitimate) # Equal bargaining power of the parties # Duration (a time limit to the restraint is preferred) # Limit to the number of persons to which transfer is prohibited # A restraint that increases the value of property is more reasonable. There are five basic conditions that must be met in order for there to be an effective real covenant and equitable servitude: # It must be enforceable. To be enforceable it must not be too vague, it must not violate a statute or the constitution, it must not violate public policy, and it must meet the requirements under the statute of frauds. # It must touch and concern the land. # It must be intended to run. # There must be privity between the successive occupants. # There must be notice of the existence of a real covenant/equitable servitude.

She had a leading role in the film Letter to Brezhnev (1985), a low-budget film which had an international release. Later, Clarke became known for playing Jackie Dobbs in Coronation Street, from 1998 to 1999 and again from 2008 to 2010. Early life and career Clarke was born and raised in Kirkby near Liverpool. Her career as a presenter began in 1978 on the late- night television magazine show, What's On, which was only shown in the Granada region. She was known then simply as Margox. In 1983, Clarke appeared as Fran in two early episodes of the Liverpool-set Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, credited as Margi MacGregor. Her brother Frank wrote her in, because, as she later said, she \\"had a gas bill which I couldn't pay\\". She came to greater notice when she featured in the low-budget film Letter to Brezhnev (1985), the screenplay being adapted by her brother from his own play. It concerns two working class Liverpool girls who meet two Russian sailors. The film was made for approximately ¬£50,000 (Clarke called this \\"the cocaine budget on Rambo\\"), and became an international hit. At the next Evening Standard British Film Awards, Clarke was awarded the prize for \\"Most Promising Newcomer\\". Margi originated her role of Theresa in Letter to Brezhnev a few years earlier when she played the role in a modest run at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1983. Clarke followed Letter to Brezhnev with the European art-house trilogy for Finnish brothers Aki and Mika Kaurism√§ki (Helsinki Napoli All Night Long, I Hired a Contract Killer and L.A.

In the same year, she also portrayed Ronnie O'Dowd, a 'sexy' female boxer who follows her father into the world of 'pugilism' and rescues him from being 'on the skids' in New York to bring him back to Liverpool with her winnings in Blonde Fist. Following the success of The Good Sex Guide, the ITV franchise holder Carlton offered Clarke her own day-time show, and the resulting programme, Swank, co-presented with fashion designer David Emanuel, ran for two series.

He lives in Ireland with his wife, writer Diane Duane, with whom he has co-authored several works. Biography =Education= Morwood was born Robert Peter Smyth in Lisburn, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and lived there for more than thirty years. From 1969 to 1975 he attended Friends School Lisburn, a Quaker-operated primary and middle school, and then Queen's University in Belfast, where he studied English literature and acquired an honours bachelor's degree with an emphasis on middle-English poets such as Chaucer. During this period Morwood also took pilot training as a cadet pilot with the Queen's University Student Air Squadron of the Royal Air Force; though budgetary considerations (on the Air Force's side) forced Morwood to make a choice between his degree studies and his further studies as a pilot. He chose to continue his work in English literature, and subsequently resigned his commission. =Civil service= After graduation from university in 1979, Morwood took a position in the UK's civil service as a clerk working for the Customs and Excise. =Writing= During this period he began work on his first novel, which he submitted and sold in 1982. He adopted the pen name \\"Peter Morwood\\" in honour of his mother, whose maiden name was Morwood, and he legally changed his surname to match the pen name in the mid-1980s. His second and third novels were published in 1984 and 1986. =Marriage and career moves= At a science fiction convention in Glasgow, Scotland in 1985, Morwood was introduced by author Anne McCaffrey to his future wife, the fantasist and science fiction writer Diane Duane. After several more meetings and a brief courtship, Morwood asked Duane to marry him, and they celebrated their engagement at the World Science Fiction Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Morwood then returned to Northern Ireland to complete his term of employment in the Civil Service, and resigned his post in December 1986. Shortly thereafter he relocated to Los Angeles, California, where Duane was working for the animation studio DiC. They were married at the New England regional science fiction convention, Boskone, on 15 February 1987. Later in 1987, Morwood and Duane relocated briefly to Scotland, and then, after a short period spent roving the United Kingdom, to County Wicklow in Ireland, where the two of them reside, in Dunlavin as of 2019. Bibliography =The Book of Years and Clan Wars sequences= These two sequences of books center on a feudal-style realm called Alba and the struggles of various clans for its domination. The first sequence is told from the point of view of Aldric Talvalin, scion of a warrior clan of Alba, who is unwillingly drawn into the bloody intrigues of Alban politics and the machinations of the Drusalan Empire, including its power-behind-the-throne, the evilly scheming and sorcerous Commander Voord. * The Horse Lord (), 1983 * The Demon Lord (), 1984 * The Dragon Lord (), 1986 * The Warlord's Domain (), 1989 A fifth book (tentatively titled The Shadow Lord) and a sixth (title as yet indeterminate) have been projected for more than two decades. The four Horse Lords novels were reissued by DAW Books in 2005 as a pair of two-book omnibus volumes: * The Book Of Years, Volume 1 () * The Book Of Years, Volume 2 () In Volume 2, the novel previously published as The Warlord's Domain was restored to its intended title, The War Lord. The Clan Wars sequence is (so far) a pair of prequels, telling the story of how the Clan Lords (including Aldric Talvalin's remote ancestors) invaded the land of Alba, settled it, and eventually came to dominate it. * Greylady () * Widowmaker () A third volume (tentatively titled Cradlesong) is projected. =Tales of Old Russia= This series, densely interwoven with motifs from Russian folktale and legend, tells the story of the young tsar Ivan Khorlovskiy, heir to the throne of the city of Khorlov. Complications instantly ensue when he meets, on a battlefield full of the slain, the sorceress-tsarevna Marya Morevna, \\"the most beautiful princess in all the Russias\\", and becomes involved willy-nilly in her entanglement with the ancient and deadly being known as Koschei the Undying. The series goes on to deal humorously with the difficulties of a \\"two-kingdom household\\", especially when one partner is both a skilled sorcerer and the mother of one's (rather unusual) children, and ‚Äì more seriously ‚Äì with the political problems that can beset a small independent tsardom in the face of such threats as the Teutonic Knights and the Golden Horde of the Great Khan. *Prince Ivan (1990) *Firebird (1992) *The Golden Horde (1993) A fourth volume, The Blue Kremlin, is projected since the mid-1990s. =Star Trek = Morwood has written one solo Star Trek novel: * Star Trek: The Original Series #48: Rules of Engagement He has also collaborated on one with Diane Duane (this novel was written during their honeymoon): * Star Trek: TOS: Rihannsu #2: The Romulan Way =Other prose works= Morwood has occasionally collaborated with Diane Duane on other novels, primarily in \\"licensed\\" universes or shared-world scenarios.

He first appeared on-screen on 19 July 1995. Originally a secondary character, he was given a more prominent role in 1997, by the executive producer of Coronation Street, Brian Park. Roy has been featured in numerous high-profile storylines, most notably marrying the first transgender character in a British soap opera, Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Storylines In 1995, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) moves into a new flat and meets fellow tenant, Roy Cropper, who seems over- helpful. Jamie Armstrong catches Roy reading a postcard Tracy Barlow (Dawn Acton) sent to Deirdre and calls him pathetic, thinking that Roy is stalking Deirdre. The tank bursts in 5 Crimea Street, making the Armstrongs and Roy panic, but Deirdre is unnerved by the way Roy takes advantage of the leak to try to get close to her. She is stunned when he tells her that he's sorry about her bereavement and tells Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) of her discomfort. Roy pesters Deirdre late at night, inviting her for a drink. Mike tells Roy to leave Deirdre alone and he makes plans to move out. Tricia Armstrong (Tracy Brabin) overhears Roy apologising to Mike for stepping in on his lady-friend. Roy asks Tricia if she's the same as Deirdre; one of Mike's women and she tells him to get lost. Roy worries that Deirdre is brooding too much and fears that she may have a breakdown but he just annoys her as she sees Roy's concern as him pestering her. Roy alerts Mike to the fact that Deirdre is shutting herself away. Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) find a cast-iron fireplace while renovating the flats and decide to sell it, but Jamie tells Roy they are stealing it and tries to blackmail them for ¬£5. Roy gets a new job washing-up in a big hotel. To help Tricia out, he buys her TV for ¬£30. Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) takes Roy on to help out in the cafe. Roy is interested to hear that Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff) has a ghost and offers the benefit of his experience, lending Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) books on ghosts and haunted houses. Vera and her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) are alarmed to find Roy camping in their cellar at night searching for any signs of a ghost. He hasn't found anything. Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) turns to Deirdre for help after Jim beats her up, with Roy paying her taxi fare for her. Roy gives Liz flowers and advises her to report Jim to the police for assault. Roy takes charge as the menfolk - Jack, Bill, Martin, Fred Elliott (John Savident), Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley), Gary Mallett (Ian Mercer) and Billy Williams (Frank Mills) - set off to the races. Roy refuses to drink with the others and spends his time working out a formula to win on the horses. He fancies betting on \\"Betty's Hot Shot\\". The others join him as they like the name. \\"Betty's Hot Shot\\" wins at 50-1, giving the men ¬£250 each. Jack suggests they invest their winnings by buying the horse as it's a selling handicap. The trainer, Hilary Forrest (Julia Goodman), tells them the horse has tons of potential. Roy pulls out of buying the horse but the others go for it. Jack bids on their behalf, unsure about what he's doing. The men buy the horse for ¬£2,600 guineas, costing their winnings plus ¬£90 each. Hilary agrees to keep training him. The men are horrified when Roy tells them it costs ¬£10,000 a year to keep a racehorse. Roy volunteers to help out at the caf√© so Gail Platt (Helen Worth) can have a week off with her family. Alma Baldwin (Amanda Barrie) is impressed by Roy's ideas on catering and his no-smoking policy at the caf√©. Jamie has no money for lunch so offers postage stamps instead at the caf√©. Roy realises he is hungry and plays along, hiring his baseball cap for four hours at ¬£1 an hour in exchange for food. Jamie thinks that he's mad. Gary starts to dig the foundations for the conservatory, scaling it all down so it will fit in the yard. He worries when Roy asks him about his anti-damp preparations and tells him that he won't get any sun as the yard is north-facing. Gail can't cope with working and with Alma away, she gets Roy and Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) to run the caf√©. Roy considers starting a syndicate for the lottery which doesn't involve buying tickets as he feels the odds are against winning. He feels that there's too much gambling in the world. Gail finds it hard to concentrate at work and is surprised to discover that Roy knows how she feels as he explains how his father disappeared one day. He urges her to think positively. Roy purchases Alma's share of Jim's Caf√© and goes into business with Gail, renaming the caf√©, Roy's Rolls. Roy meets Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), with whom he instantly finds a rapport. Like himself, she is shy and naive; they find they have a lot in common and begin dating but during an intimate dinner, Hayley reveals that she is a transgender woman who has not yet undergone gender confirmation surgery. Roy reacts badly, rejecting Hayley and becoming depressed until Alma makes Roy realise that he has been hasty. When Hayley leaves to have gender confirmation surgery in Amsterdam, Roy misses her and goes to Amsterdam to meet her and bring her back. Hayley buys Gail's share in the caf√© and she moves in with Roy. He proposes to Hayley on Valentine's Day 1999, but she initially declines due to the fact that the law does not recognise her gender as legitimate and thus misclassifies her relationship with Roy as same-sex, with same-sex marriage not yet legal in the UK. More problems arise when Hayley's secret becomes public knowledge. Roy is embarrassed but, following various arguments, he pledges to stand by Hayley and proposes again. This time she accepts, but when they go to see a vicar; he refuses to marry them. However, Roy meets Jessica Lundy (Olwen May), a curate who agrees to perform a blessing ceremony for him and Hayley but the church ceremony is ruined when Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) alerts the press. Roy and Hayley return to the caf√© and have the blessing there instead and Hayley gets her surname changed by deed poll to Cropper. Knowing they can not have children of their own, Roy and Hayley become temporary foster carers, taking in troublesome sixteen-year-old Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and she causes them various problems. They also look after Wayne Hayes (Gary Damer) and form a close relationship. He visits them repeatedly and even his mother comes to visit on one occasion, worried about the influence Roy and Hayley have over Wayne. Wayne's stepfather, however, takes advantage of their feelings for Wayne and allow them to take custody of Wayne as long as they pay him for the privilege. However, eventually Roy and Hayley decide to stand up to Wayne's stepfather and refuse to give him back and even go on the run with Wayne briefly but Wayne's mother calls the police and reports them for kidnapping her son, and they are caught and arrested. The charges are dropped when Wayne's domestic situation is exposed. For a bet with Bev Unwin (Susie Blake), Tracy (now played by Kate Ford) spikes Roy's drink at a wedding reception. She then takes him home and puts him in her bed. Tracy later announces she is pregnant with his child. Hayley is devastated and after she leaves Roy, he contemplates suicide. Hayley returns and the Croppers agree to buy Tracy's baby and wanting to make sure they have parental rights to the baby, Roy marries Tracy. Tracy gives birth to a daughter and she gives custody to the Croppers, who register her birth and name her Patience but Tracy reveals, on Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Karen Phillips' (Suranne Jones) wedding day, that she wants her daughter back and that Steve is Patience's father, not Roy as they never actually slept together. Initially they refuse to give Patience back to Tracy, but are persuaded by Ken Barlow (William Roache); Tracy's adoptive father. Roy is devastated and he and Hayley reluctantly return the baby and Tracy renames her Amy (Elle Mulvaney). Roy and Tracy's marriage is subsequently annulled and feeling guilty, she repays the money that the Croppers gave her and asks them to be her godparents. Roy is bullied by builder Vince (Conrad Nelson) and his arrival brings up many unpleasant memories for Roy, as he recounts to Hayley the physical and psychological torture he suffered in his youth. When he is alone in the cafe, Vince comes in and demands a free meal. When Roy gives in and brings him a fry up, he says he asked for a poached egg, not a fried one. He then pushes the egg onto the floor and Roy attempts to push into him, but Vince pushes him onto the floor, knocking him against a table in the process. He is only stopped by Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward), who warns Vince not to return to the Street, taking him outside onto the Street and punching him to the ground. Roy mentors Fiz's younger brother Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and he sells his comic collection to buy a Morris Traveller. Roy is furious when he learns Hayley has a son and their marriage nearly ends. However, with support from his co-worker, Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), Roy makes peace with Hayley and supports her when she decides to take a year out to do charity work in Mozambique. Roy allows Becky to move in while Hayley is away, but he throws her out when he learns about her affair with Steve. They later make up and Roy gives her away at her wedding. Roy finds Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) lying outside Underworld after he has suffered a heart attack. Roy calls an ambulance and Tony is rushed to hospital. Roy is shocked when Tony confesses to having Liam Connor (Rob James- Collier) murdered. Tony recovers and Roy fails to persuade him to confess the truth. Tony threatens to kill Roy and Hayley and they report him to the police, resulting in Tony's arrest. The police let him go due to a lack of evidence and Tony tries to murder Roy with a knife by trying to sneak up on him when he was bat-watching by the river, but Tony's mobile phone rings, alerting Roy, and ends up pushing Roy into the canal. On seeing his struggles as he can not swim, Tony rescues him and later hands himself in to the police, while Roy is found by Hayley and Becky. Roy proposes to Hayley again, but tensions over the wedding cause Hayley to move in with Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). A few weeks later, Tony breaks out of prison with the help of Robbie Sloane, a former cellmate and plans to hold Hayley and Carla Connor (Alison King) hostage at Underworld. Robbie poses as a businessman and lures Carla into the factory alone before holding her at gunpoint, and leaving her tied to her office chair with her mouth taped shut. He then tells Hayley that Carla has had an accident to get her into the factory. Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged but Robbie holds her at gunpoint too before she can escape. Tony then arrives. Tony rips the tape off Carla's mouth and announces his plans to murder them. After hearing what has happened, Roy heads to the factory and begs for Hayley's life. After Carla pleads with Tony, Hayley is later released and she is then reunited with Roy, just as the factory is blown up; although Carla manages to escape but Tony kills himself by walking back into the burning factory. On the day of his wedding, Hayley is late due to some interference by scorned wedding planner Mary Taylor (Patti Clare). She eventually makes it to the ceremony and she and Roy are married. Roy receives a letter from his estranged mother, Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole), telling him that his stepfather has died. A few days later, Sylvia turns up in Weatherfield to give Roy a train set. Hayley asks Roy to let Sylvia move in with them and she begins working with Roy in the caf√©. Sylvia asks why she has not yet had grandchildren, and Hayley initially passes her infertility off as menopause. She is livid to discover that Hayley is transgender, but after getting to know Hayley, she learns to accept her for who she is. Everything goes swimmingly for the Croppers, but in 2013, Roy tries to find his estranged father online, but learns that his father St. John has died just months earlier. He struggles to come to terms with his father's death, and begins sleepwalking. Hayley agrees to go through medical tests with Roy for support, but her own test results detect abnormal liver function, and is then diagnosed with stage-two pancreatic cancer. While the pair are on holiday to take Hayley's mind off things, Sylvia leaves a note explaining that she has left Weatherfield but does not give a specific reason. A while after, Roy and Hayley are dealt with the news that her cancer is terminal. Hayley then reveals that she wants to die before the cancer reverts her back to her old self, but Roy struggles to accept her decision. Arguments ensue regularly over her decision, and this leads to Hayley leaving Roy temporarily. While she is living with Fiz and her boyfriend Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall), Hayley collapses and is told she has an infection. In December, the couple are told that she has weeks left to live, much to their devastation. Hayley tells Roy to only break the news to a selected few, including Anna, Carla, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Fiz, Tyrone, Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) and Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie). In January 2014, Hayley decides it's time to end her life and after a final visit from Fiz and Tyrone, Hayley makes herself a lethal cocktail, containing drugs. Roy lies on the bed with Hayley as she drinks the cocktail, which kills her. Carla and Anna are worried about what is happening in the Croppers' flat and decide to investigate, where they find a dead Hayley on the bed with Roy's arm around her. Anna and Carla soon guess that Hayley committed suicide. Roy struggles to come to terms with Hayley's death, and is dealt with more stress when Fiz discovers that Hayley killed herself. She is furious and shouts at Roy before storming off. Roy is then angry with Hayley for ending her life and leaving him behind. After Hayley's funeral, Roy leaves a note for Anna and Fiz explaining that he has left Weatherfield to visit Sylvia and aunt Jean. This relieves Fiz and Anna, but they are unaware that Roy has not gone to visit Sylvia and was last seen wandering the city streets. When a pipe bursts at the caf√©, Anna and Fiz become worried about Roy's whereabouts. Fiz calls Roy's aunt Jean, who reveals that she has not seen Roy in six months and that Sylvia is on holiday in Tenerife. Anna then calls the police and Fiz nearly tells them that Roy is not coping after Hayley committed suicide, but she then thinks about the consequences and does not. When Roy's favourite shopping bag is found in a canal, Fiz and Tyrone frantically search Manchester armed with a photograph of Roy. When they eventually get home, Fiz reveals her worries to Tyrone and tells him that she thinks that Roy is dead. Roy returns in mid-February 2014, after being seen by Steve and Tracy at a railway museum. It is revealed that Roy has visited the museum every day since he disappeared from Weatherfield to take his mind off Hayley's death. Roy is not seen for a while following his return to Weatherfield, and it is later revealed that he has been obsessively building a model railway in his living room. This shocks Fiz but fascinates Tyrone and Chesney. In April 2015, Roy meets a widow called Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill) at the allotment, she tells him that her husband Alan has died and Roy reveals his own struggle with grief when Hayley died. Roy gets on well with Cathy and decide to meet up to go to places such as the art gallery. Carla thinks against this and takes it as disrespect to his late wife Hayley. In July 2015, Roy visits Cathy at her house and is shocked to discover that she keeps all her rubbish piled up in the living room. Roy thinks that she needs support but Cathy is against the idea and won't take no for an answer. Roy prepares to go to Deirdre's 60th birthday party after spending the day with Cathy when Carla tells him the terrible news that Deirdre died, Roy reflects on the first time he met Deirdre and feels upset that she has died, Cathy comforts him. Cathy and Roy soon start a relationship and later get engaged. Creation=Background= The character Royston Cropper, played by David Neilson, is introduced in July 1995 as \\"a rather odd and scary loner\\" living in a block of flats near the long- running character Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride). Actor David Neilson got the part on the recommendation of Coronation Street writer Stephen Mallatratt, a close friend of Neilson's who helped to \\"mould the character\\". According to Neilson, the character was initially only brought in for six episodes, but the role was extended and Roy was made into a regular character. Described primarily as an \\"incidental character\\", Roy is not given any significant storylines until 1997. Behind the scenes, the soap was going through a period of change. Coronation Street was lagging behind the BBC's rival soap EastEnders in the ratings, so a new executive producer, Brian Park, was brought in to revitalise the show and attract younger viewers. Aside from multiple axings and introducing various dramatic storylines, Park also decided to give some of the less prominent existing characters a much higher profile; among them was Roy Cropper, who was brought to the forefront of the soap throughout 1997 and 1998, taking over a share in Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) caf√© (changing its name to Roy's Rolls). This gave the character more screen time and, gradually, he was incorporated into the lives of other characters. =Personality= Originally, Roy was intended as a psychopathic, villainous character whose tenure would last for only six episodes.Crawford, Sue. Coronation Street: I secretly made Roy Cropper autistic to stop him being axed says actor David Neilson. Daily Mirror. 28 October 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2011. Neilson described the character as \\"scary\\", and \\"a bit like Norman Bates in [the horror film] Psycho\\". However, Neilson felt compelled to reinvent Roy as a sympathetic character, socially inept, rather than menacing. His pestering of neighbour Deirdre Rachid and his unusual behaviour could be explained by Asperger syndrome‚Äîa disorder which Neilson has since attempted to portray in the character. This ultimately extended the character's screen life, turning him into a fan favourite. Misunderstood, he was almost evicted from his flats for his behaviour towards Deirdre, though he was actually only showing concern for her welfare. He was summed up by the character Mike Baldwin as \\"a bit of a nutter, but harmless enough\\". Although it has never been officially confirmed on-screen, it has indeed been suggested by critics that Roy has Asperger syndrome, due to his obsessive compulsive tendencies and because of his literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuances and subtleties. Described as \\"remarkably intelligent, but socially na√Øve\\", Roy Cropper is a pure atheist. He is a fan of buses and trains, wears a beige anorak, scarf, woollen gloves and clutching a nylon shopping bag with a set of keys taped to the handle. Actor David Neilson has since revealed that his character's \\"infamous old shopping bag\\", complete with attached keys, were props that he introduced. The bag and keys belonged to Neilson's mother, who died shortly before he took on the role in 1995. He has commented, \\"My mum sadly passed away just before I started on the show and I wanted to carry something of hers. I also wanted to add my own props and develop the character. The bag carries nothing more than my script.\\" Despite Roy's initial \\"creepy\\" persona, viewers were eventually shown a different side to the character. He was converted from a creep to an eccentric; a quiet and shy intellectual man, with few social skills and a penchant for trivial information, but underneath it all, a man with \\"a heart of gold\\". He has been described as compassionate, moral, sensitive and full of integrity; taking in waifs and strays and helping his neighbours whenever possible. Commenting on his character, Neilson has said, \\"Roy is absolutely his own person and hugely honourable. Some people think he's simple. He's not. He's a very complex man with hidden depths. And there's lots more to explore...There's something tragic about Roy. I think there is a big black cloud that follows him around and one day it is going to really dump on him.\\" Development=Hayley Cropper= As the character becomes more prominent, producers decided to introduce a romantic interest for Roy. Hayley Patterson is introduced in 1998, and her relationship with Roy turns out to be one of the more controversial storylines in Coronation Street's history, as it is later revealed that Hayley is a transgender woman. In an article published by \\"Press for Change\\" (a political lobbying and educational organisation, which campaigns to achieve equal civil rights and liberties for all trans people in the UK), an advisor who helped studio writers at Granada Television with this storyline has given an account on its conceptualisation: \\"It was decided that Roy needed a girlfriend, but what kind of woman would go for Roy, or vice-versa? Ideally, she would have to be a female mirror image of himself. So the character started development and Hayley Patterson...was created. But then someone suggested something; what if she had a dark secret? What if she was transsexual!? Hayley being Harry, in her past life. After some argument and hard thinking, the idea stuck. It was a very controversial move for the long- running show... 'Corrie' had never gone this far.\\" Hayley's initial purpose was to boost ratings and to act as a \\"foil\\" for Roy, \\"to bring him out of himself a bit and show another side to the man\\". There were initial criticisms about the storyline and the character of Hayley from the transgender community in the UK, mainly because the actress who played Hayley was not transgender. However, as the storyline progressed, viewers and critics warmed to Roy and Hayley's romance. Hayley was finally shown to relay her secret to Roy during a candlelit meal in his cafe. Horrified, Roy rejected her, but after a period of reflection he eventually came around, resolving to remain friends with Hayley until she left for Amsterdam to undergo gender confirmation surgery. Although the character of Hayley was only meant to be short-term, she and her relationship with Roy were so well received by viewers, that the producers of Coronation Street decide to reintroduce her. On-screen, Roy tracks down Hayley and they reunite in a special set of episodes, shot on location in Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Hayley is persuaded to return to Weatherfield with Roy and rebuild their relationship. Actor David Neilson has complimented the storyline, describing the writing as \\"absolutely beautiful\\", and Roy and Hayley are now considered to be one of Coronation Street's \\"classic\\" couples. =Temporary departure= On 12 November 2015, it was reported by the Sun newspaper that Neilson would be taking a three-month break as he wanted to join a stage show and tread the boards, while the break would also allow him to \\"recharge\\". The newspaper added that ITV said it was \\"happy to accommodate\\" his leave, and he will be written out of the show. Roy departed on 22 January 2016 as he headed to Hastings to care for his mother Sylvia; who had broken her hip. He returned to the show on 9 May 2016. Reception For his portrayal of Roy, Neilson won \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards. Neilson won \\"Best Actor\\", \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\", \\"Best Storyline\\" (alongside Julie Hesmondhalgh), \\"Best Single Episode\\" (alongside Julie Hesmondhalgh) and \\"Best On-Screen partnership\\" (alongside Julie Hesmondhalgh) at The British Soap Awards 2014.

Service  6229 was built in 1938 at Crewe as the tenth member of its class and the last in the second batch of five red streamliners, complete with gold speed cheat stripes (the original five 6220-4 having been given a unique Caledonian blue livery with silver stripes). In 1939 no. 6229 swapped identities with the first of the class 6220 Coronation and was sent to North America with a specially-constructed Coronation Scot train to appear at the 1939 New York World's Fair. There was therefore for a while a blue 6229 Duchess of Hamilton in the UK and a red 6220 Coronation in the USA. R.A. Riddles drove for most of the tour, owing to the illness of the assigned driver. The locomotive (though not its carriages) was shipped back from the States in 1942 after the outbreak of the Second World War, and the identities of the locomotives were swapped back in 1943. The carriages returned in 1946. 6229 was painted wartime black livery in November 1944. Its streamlined casing was removed for maintenance-efficiency reasons in December 1947 and it was then given the LMS 1946 black livery. In 1948, 6229 passed into BR ownership. BR renumbered the locomotive as 46229 on 15 April 1948. It was painted in the short-lived BR blue livery in April 1950, but was soon repainted on 26 April 1952 into Brunswick green. The semi-streamlined smokebox was replaced with a round-topped smokebox in February 1957, and in September 1958 the locomotive was painted maroon. The lining was BR style to begin with; then in October 1959 it received the current LMS style lining which it has carried for all the years in preservation.  Preservation  46229 was saved from the scrap yard along with non streamlined classmate 6233 Duchess of Sutherland, as a result of Sir Billy Butlin's efforts to place these locomotives as children's playground exhibits at his holiday camps. The third preserved member of the class 6235 City of Birmingham was donated by British Railways to Birmingham City Council for preservation within the Birmingham Industrial Museum. Having started construction work in the winter of 1961, the new ¬£2 million Butlins Minehead camp opened to the public on 26 May 1962. Duchess of Hamilton and LB&SCR; A1 class Knowle were added in 1964, after being transported there by Pickfords. Under a camp refurbishment and modernisation programme, the locomotives left the holiday camp in March 1975 via railhead access at Minehead railway station and the then closed West Somerset Railway. In 1976, the Friends of the National Railway Museum accepted the locomotive from Butlin's on a twenty-year loan deal, and immediately began to restore and preserve it. It first ran as the Museum's flagship locomotive in 1980 and was operational until 1985. After purchasing the locomotive from Butlin's in 1987, after an extensive overhaul it resumed running in 1989, withdrawn from main line duty in 1996 when its seven-year boiler ticket expired. From 1998 to 2005, 46229 was a static exhibit in the National Railway Museum, standing next to Mallard. In September 2005 the National Railway Museum announced that the streamlining would be re-instated, returning the locomotive to its original appearance. This work was undertaken at Tyseley Locomotive Works and on 18 May 2009 it was returned to the National Railway Museum, going on display in a new exhibition called \\"Duchess of Hamilton Streamlined: Styling An Era\\". Since then, the locomotive is on display next to a 1937 Chrysler Airflow.

It owns more than of land in the Toronto region and employs more than 400 full-time employees and coordinates more than 3,000 volunteers each year. TRCA's area of jurisdiction is watershed-based, and includes 3,467 square kilometres: 2,506 on land and 961 water-based in Lake Ontario. This area comprises nine watersheds from west to east: Etobicoke Creek, Mimico Creek, Humber River, Don River, Highland Creek, Petticoat Creek, Rouge River, Duffins Creek, Carruthers Creek. The lands TRCA administers are used for flood control, recreation, education and watershed preservation activities, including drinking water source protection. On several sites, TRCA operates conservation areas open to the public for recreational use. The TRCA also operates the Black Creek Pioneer Village, which preserves several 1800s-era buildings in a pioneer setting. Several municipal parks inside and outside Toronto are located on TRCA lands, such as the Toronto Zoo, Humber Bay Park and Milne Park. The TRCA operates five dams for flood control. Based out of its Kortright Centre for Conservation, the TRCA offers knowledge and experience to help its partners contribute to a healthy city region. This includes ecology and the study of water quality, natural habitats, plants, animals and more. It helps identify environmental needs, set targets, and restore natural areas. It advises partners about land use, development proposals and construction, and environmental education to help students and community members appreciate their local environment and learn to look after it. This work is focused in and around Toronto including portions of the Regions of Peel, York, and Durham. History In 1946, a number of conservation authorities were established by the Province to administer the numerous watersheds of the Toronto region (Don Valley CA, Etobicoke-Mimico CA, Humber Valley CA, Rouge CA, Duffin Creek CA, Highland Creek CA and Petticoat Creek CA) under the Conservation Authorities Act. These early conservation authorities were funded by the municipalities that bordered on their valleys, and any land purchases had to be proposed and funded from either the Province of Ontario grants, local municipal levies or grants on a project-by-project basis. For example, in 1951, the Don Valley CA proposed a conservation area at the point where Lawrence Avenue today crosses the East Don River in Toronto. The DVCA also proposed a halt on transportation uses in the valley. Funding was not approved for the project and the land was eventually used for the Don Valley Parkway project. In conjunction with the formation of the conservation authorities, volunteer organizations sprang up to assist the conservation authorities in their missions. In Toronto, the Don Valley Conservation Association was established in 1946 by Roy Cadwell, Rand Freeland and Charles Sauriol to protect the lands of the Don River valley from a proposed development. The Association went on to other activities, including tree plantings, wild flower and tree preservation and advocacy. The Association organized popular 'conservation special' train outings from the Don Station north along the CNR line to Richmond Hill and other destinations to promote the conservation of the Don Valley. Sauriol would later become a director of the MTRCA. Watershed management also included promoting activities such as recreation and public education on authority lands. The Humber Valley CA opened Albion Hills Conservation Area in Caledon as well as Dalziel Pioneer Park, around a historic 1809 barn located on farmland in the Humber River valley. The designated conservation areas charged daily use fees for the general public to use their facilities, unlike typical public parks. After the deaths and damage of Hurricane Hazel in 1954, governments recognized the need for improved regulation of river floodplains. In 1957, the four Toronto-area authorities were merged into the single Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and given full legal authority to purchase and expropriate lands for conservation. In conjunction with this, the Province of Ontario passed legislation that made building on floodplains illegal. The authority retained the name until 1997, when Metro Toronto was abolished. In 1959, MTRCA developed its Plan for Flood Control and Water Conservation, which outlined a CDN $22 million plan of dam construction, flood channel construction and floodplain acquisition. In total, 15 dams, four channels were to be built and of land to be acquired. The MTRCA constructed three of the 15 dams: Clairville, Milne and G. Ross Lord dam, plus others in Stouffville and on the Black Creek. The Authority constructed twelve flood control channels and two flood control dykes. Over 280 erosion control works were also constructed. The MTRCA continued to operate the Dalziel Pioneer Park. In 1960, the MTRCA opened Black Creek Pioneer Village on the Stong Farm, at the corner of Jane and Steeles on the Black Creek, which expanded on the Dalziel lands. It subsequently added other pioneer buildings relocated from around the Toronto area. The village became a popular tourist destination in its own right. In 1982, the MTRCA opened the Kortright Centre for Conservation in Woodbridge, Ontario. Its mission is to be \\"a centre of excellence in the field of sustainable technology\\". The 325 hectare property hosts educational programs for students, workshops for industry and the general public, technology demonstrations in a park-like setting.

Unlike the theory of social evolutionism, which views the evolution of society and human history as progressing in some new, unique direction(s), sociological cycle theory argues that events and stages of society and history generally repeat themselves in cycles. Such a theory does not necessarily imply that there cannot be any social progress. In the early theory of Sima Qian and the more recent theories of long-term (\\"secular\\") political- demographic cyclesE.g. Korotayev, A., Malkov, A., & Khaltourina, D. (2006) Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: URSS. . Chapter 4. as well as in the Varnic theory of P.R. Sarkar an explicit accounting is made of social progress. Historical forerunners Interpretation of history as repeating cycles of Dark and Golden Ages was a common belief among ancient cultures.Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance By Daniel W. Rossides. Pg. 69 The more limited cyclical view of history defined as repeating cycles of events was put forward in the academic world in the 19th century in historiosophy (a branch of historiography) and is a concept that falls under the category of sociology. However, Polybius, Ibn Khaldun (see Asabiyyah), and Giambattista Vico can be seen as precursors of this analysis. The Saeculum was identified in Roman times. In recent times, P. R. Sarkar in his Social Cycle Theory has used this idea to elaborate his interpretation of history. 19th and 20th century theories Among the prominent historiosophers, Russian philosopher Nikolai Danilewski (1822‚Äì1885) is important. In Rossiia i Evropa (1869) he differentiated between various smaller civilizations (Egyptian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, Roman, German, and Slav, among others). He wrote that each civilization has a life cycle, and by the end of the 19th century the Roman- German civilization was in decline, while the Slav civilization was approaching its Golden Age. A similar theory was put forward by Oswald Spengler (1880‚Äì1936) who in his Der Untergang des Abendlandes (1918) also argued that the Western civilization had entered its final phase of development and its decline was inevitable. The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848‚Äì1923) in his Trattato di Sociologia Generale (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an elite social class, which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the power constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa. Sociological cycle theory was also developed by Pitirim A. Sorokin (1889‚Äì1968) in his Social and Cultural Dynamics (1937, 1943). He classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be ideational (reality is spiritual), sensate (reality is material), or idealistic (a synthesis of the two). He interpreted the contemporary West as a sensate civilization dedicated to technological progress and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era. Alexandre Deulofeu (1903‚Äì1978) developed a mathematical model of social cycles that he claimed fit historical facts. He argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles in his book Mathematics of History (in Catalan, published in 1951). He claims that each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of Romanesque art, during the 9th century, in an area between Empord√† and Roussillon, which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization. Literary expressions Much of Post Apocalyptic fiction depicts various kinds of cyclical history, with depictions of civilization collapsing and being slowly built up again to collapse again and so on. An early example is Anatole France's 1908 satirical novel ) (Penguin Island) which traces the history of Penguinia - a thinly disguised analogue of France - from medieval times to the modern times and into a future of a monstrous super-city - which eventually collapses. This is followed by a renewed Feudalism and agrarian society, and a gradual building up of increasingly advanced civilization - culminating with a new monstrous super-city which would eventually collapse again, and so on. A later example is Walter M. Miller Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz, which begins in the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war, with the Catholic Church seeking to preserve a remnant of old texts (as it did in the historical Early Middle Ages), and ends with a new civilization, built up over two thousand years, once again destroying itself in a nuclear war - and a new group of Catholic clergy yet again setting out to preserve a remnant of civilized knowledge. In the future depicted in October the First Is Too Late, a 1966 science fiction novel by astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, the protagonists fly over where they expected to see the United States, but see no sign of urban civilization. At first assuming they were in the pre-1750 past, they later find it was a future time. Humanity is doomed to go through repeated cycles of industrialization, overpopulation, collapse - followed by rebuilding, and then again industrialization, overpopulation and collapse and so on, over and over again. In the far future, a civilization which is aware of this history no longer wants progress. Contemporary theories One of the most important recent findings in the study of the long-term dynamic social processes was the discovery of the political-demographic cycles as a basic feature of the dynamics of complex agrarian systems. The presence of political-demographic cycles in the pre-modern history of Europe and China, and in chiefdom level societies worldwide has been known for quite a long time,E.g., Postan 1950, 1973; Sahlins 1963; Abel 1974, 1980; Ladurie 1974; Hodder 1978; Braudel 1973; Chao 1986; H. T. Wright 1984; Cameron 1989; Goldstone 1991; Kul'pin 1990; Anderson 1994; Mugruzin 1986, 1994, etc. and already in the 1980s more or less developed mathematical models of demographic cycles started to be produced (first of all for Chinese \\"dynastic cycles\\") (Usher 1989). At the moment we have a considerable number of such models (Chu and Lee 1994; Nefedov 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004; S. Malkov, Kovalev, and A. Malkov 2000; S. Malkov and A. Malkov 2000; Malkov and Sergeev 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Malkov et al. 2002; Malkov 2002, 2003, 2004; Turchin 2003, 2005a; Korotayev et al. 2006). = Long cycle theory = George Modelski, who presented his ideas in the book, Long Cycles in World Politics (1987), is the chief architect of long cycle theory. In a nutshell, long cycle theory describes the connection between war cycles, economic supremacy, and the political aspects of world leadership. Long cycles, or long waves, offer interesting perspectives on global politics by permitting \\"the careful exploration of the ways in which world wars have recurred, and lead states such as Britain and the United States have succeeded each other in an orderly manner.\\" Not to be confused with Simon Kuznets' idea of long-cycles, or long-swings, long cycles of global politics are patterns of past world politics.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987. The long cycle, according to Dr. Dan Cox, is a period of time lasting approximately 70 to 100 years. At the end of that period, \\"the title of most powerful nation in the world switches hands.\\".Jimmy Myers. \\"Missouri Western Faculty Discuss Iraq War.\\" St. Joseph News-Press. 2 Mar 2007. Modelski divides the long cycle into four phases. When periods of global war, which could last as much as one-fourth of the total long cycle, are factored in, the cycle can last from 87 to 122 years.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987, 102 Many traditional theories of international relations, including the other approaches to hegemony, believe that the baseline nature of the international system is anarchy.Mark Rupert. \\"Hegemonic Stability Theory. Modelski's long cycle theory, however, states that war and other destabilizing events are a natural product of the long cycle and larger global system cycle. They are part of the living processes of the global polity and social order. Wars are \\"systemic decisions\\" that \\"punctuate the movement of the system at regular intervals.\\" Because \\"world politics is not a random process of hit or miss, win or lose, depending on the luck of the draw or the brute strength of the contestants,\\" anarchy simply doesn't play a role. After all, long cycles have provided, for the last five centuries, a means for the successive selection and operation of numerous world leaders.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987, 100, 135 and 227. Modeslki used to believe that long cycles were a product of the modern period. He suggests that the five long cycles, which have taken place since about 1500, are each a part of a larger global system cycle, or the modern world system. Under the terms of long cycle theory, five hegemonic long cycles have taken place, each strongly correlating to economic Kondratieff Waves (or K-Waves). The first hegemon would have been Portugal during the 16th century, then the Netherlands during the 17th century. Next, Great Britain served twice, first during the 18th century, then during the 19th century. The United States has been serving as hegemon since the end of World War II. In 1988, Joshua S Goldstein advanced the concept of the political midlife crisis in his book on \\"long cycle theory\\", Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age, which offers four examples of the process: *The British Empire and the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856): A century after Britain's successful launch of the Industrial Revolution, and following the subsequent British railway boom of 1815‚Äì1853, Britain, in the Crimean War, attacked the Russian Empire, which was perceived as a threat to British India and to eastern Mediterranean trade routes to India. The Crimean War highlighted the poor state of the British Army, which were then addressed, and Britain concentrated on colonial expansion and took no further part in European wars until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. *The German Empire (Second Reich) and World War I (1914‚Äì1918): Under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, Germany had been unified between 1864 and 1871, and then had seen 40 years' rapid industrial, military, and colonial expansion. In 1914 the Schlieffen Plan for conquering France in eight weeks was to have been followed by the subjugation of the Russian Empire, leaving Germany the master of Mitteleuropa (Central Europe). In the event, France, Britain, Russia, and the United States fought Germany to a standstill, to defeat, and to a humiliating peace settlement at Versailles (1919) and the establishment of Germany's unstable Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì33), in a prelude to World War II. *The Soviet Union and the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): The Soviet Union had industrialised rapidly under Joseph Stalin and, following World War II, had become a rival nuclear superpower to the United States. In 1962 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, intent on securing strategic parity with the United States, covertly, with the support of Fidel Castro, shipped nuclear missiles to Castro's Cuba, 70 miles from the US state of Florida. US President John F. Kennedy blockaded (the term \\"quarantined\\" being used because a blockade is an act of war), the island of Cuba and negotiated the Soviet missiles' removal from Cuba (in exchange for the subsequent removal of US missiles from Turkey). *The United States and the Vietnam War (1955‚Äì1975): During World War II and the ensuing postwar period, the United States had greatly expanded its military capacities and industries. After France, supported financially by the US, had been defeated in Vietnam in 1954 and that country had been temporarily split into North and South Vietnam under the 1954 Geneva Accords; and when war had broken out between the North and South following South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to permit all-Vietnam elections in 1956 as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the ideologically anti-communist United States supported South Vietnam with materiel in a Cold War proxy war and by degrees allowed itself to be drawn into South Vietnam's losing struggle against communist North Vietnam and the Viet Cong acting in South Vietnam. Ultimately, following the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States, the US's governing belief that South Vietnam's defeat would result in all of remaining Mainland Southeast Asia \\"going communist\\" (as proclaimed by the US's \\"domino theory\\"), proved erroneous. = Kondratiev waves = In pseudoeconomics, Kondratiev waves (also called supercycles, great surges, long waves, K-waves or the long economic cycle) are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the modern world economy.The term long wave originated from a poor early translation of long cycle from Russian to German. Freeman, Chris; Lou√ß√£, Francisco (2001) pp 70 It is stated that the period of a wave ranges from forty to sixty years, the cycles consist of alternating intervals of high sectoral growth and intervals of relatively slow growth.See, e.g. Such theories are dismissed by most economists on the basis of econometric analysis which has found that recessions are essentially random events, and the probability of a recession does not show any kind of pattern across time. Despite frequent use of the term business cycles to refer to changes in an economy around its trend line, the phrase is considered a misnomer. It is widely agreed that fluctuations in economic activity do not exhibit any kind of predictable repetition over time, and the appearance of cycles is a result of pareidolia.Drautzburg, Thorsten. \\"Why Are Recessions So Hard to Predict? Random Shocks and Business Cycles.\\" Economic Insights 4, no. 1 (2019): 1-8.Slutzky, Eugen. \\"The summation of random causes as the source of cyclic processes.\\" Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society (1937): 105-146.Chatterjee, Satyajit. \\"From cycles to shocks: Progress in business cycle theory.\\" Business Review 3 (2000): 27-37. = Secular cycles theory = Recently the most important contributions to the development of the mathematical models of long-term (\\"secular\\") sociodemographic cycles have been made by Sergey Nefedov, Peter Turchin, Andrey Korotayev, and Sergey Malkov.E.g., Turchin, P. (2003) Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Turchin P., Korotayev A. Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution & History 5/2 (2006): 112‚Äì147; Korotayev, A., Malkov, A., & Khaltourina, D. (2006) Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: URSS. . Chapter 4. What is important is that on the basis of their models Nefedov, Turchin and Malkov have managed to demonstrate that sociodemographic cycles were a basic feature of complex agrarian systems (and not a specifically Chinese or European phenomenon). The basic logic of these models is as follows: * After the population reaches the ceiling of the carrying capacity of land, its growth rate declines toward near-zero values. * The system experiences significant stress with decline in the living standards of the common population, increasing the severity of famines, growing rebellions etc. * As has been shown by Nefedov, most complex agrarian systems had considerable reserves for stability, however, within 50‚Äì150 years these reserves were usually exhausted and the system experienced a demographic collapse (a Malthusian catastrophe), when increasingly severe famines, epidemics, increasing internal warfare and other disasters led to a considerable decline of population. * As a result of this collapse, free resources became available, per capita production and consumption considerably increased, the population growth resumed and a new sociodemographic cycle started. It has become possible to model these dynamics mathematically in a rather effective way. Note that the modern theories of political-demographic cycles do not deny the presence of trend dynamics and attempt at the study of the interaction between cyclical and trend components of historical dynamics. = Fourth Turning theory = The Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory, also known as the Fourth Turning theory or simply the Fourth Turning, which was created by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, describes a theorized recurring generation cycle in American history. According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) in which a new social, political, and economic climate exists. Turnings tend to last around 20‚Äì22 years. They are part of a larger cyclical \\"saeculum\\" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 90 years, although some saecula have lasted longer). The theory states that after every saeculum, a crisis recurs in American history, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which ultimately creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis. = Schlesinger cycles of United States history = The Cyclical theory (United States history) is a theory of US history developed by Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.. It states that US history alternates between two kinds of phases: * Liberal, increasing democracy, public purpose, concern with the wrongs of the many and human rights * Conservative, containing democracy, private interest, concern with the rights of the few and property rights Each kind of phase generates the other. Liberal phases generate conservative phases from activism burnout, and conservative phases generate liberal phases from accumulation of unsolved problems. = Klingberg cycles of United States foreign policy = Frank Klingberg has proposed a cyclic theory of US foreign policy.(Page 7 of 56) - Long-Term US Foreign Policy Moods and Involvement in System Wars: Is There Any Way to Reduce the Odds? authored by Lawrence, Colin., Holmes, Jack., Johnson, Lauren. and Aardema, Sara. It states that the US alternates between extroverted phases, phases involving military adventures, challenging other nations, and annexing territory, and introverted phases, phases with the absence of these activities.

She was born on-screen during the episode broadcast on 24 January 1977. She was played by Christabel Finch until 21 November 1983. Holly Chamarette played the role from 8 July 1985 until 23 March 1988. Dawn Acton played the role from 12 December 1988, until 14 June 1995, Acton reprised the role in November 1996, and departed in December 1997. She reprised the role once again on 17 March 1999 and made her final appearance as Tracy on 10 October 1999. Kate Ford took over the role from 25 December 2002, until 8 April 2007. Ford reprised the role for a brief stint from late May to early June 2010, before returning full-time from 24 December 2010 onwards. Tracy is the daughter of Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) and Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Tracy never had much to do with Ray and was later adopted by Deirdre's new husband Ken Barlow (William Roache). Early storylines featuring Tracy concentrated on her childhood. She went on to feature in storylines about drugs, various family crises, relationships with Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), a feud with Steve's ex-wife Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones), and a short-lived marriage to Robert Preston (Julian Kay). Her exit storyline in 2007 was the culmination of a storyline that saw Tracy imprisoned for killing her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) in revenge. In the on-screen events, Tracy was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her brief return in May 2010 saw the character lie about Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) confessing to murdering husband Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale). Her return in December 2010 saw her released from prison after forensic evidence used at her trial was discredited, and getting her daughter Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney) back and attempting to steal Steve from his wife Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) and failing; resulting in them both having a feud. Tracy also sparked a feud with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), which worsened after it transpired that Tina had kissed Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis). Rob would later murder Tina and after discovering this, Tracy and Rob's sister, Carla Connor (Alison King), turned him in and he was arrested, sparking a feud between Tracy and Carla. Tracy's former husband Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) also returned, with Tracy going on to briefly reunite with him. She has since remarried Steve and had a drunken one night stand with Paula Martin (Stirling Gallacher). Storylines=1977‚Äì1999= Tracy Lynette Langton is the daughter of Ray (Neville Buswell) and Deirdre Langton (Anne Kirkbride), born on 24 January 1977. Ray leaves when Tracy is a baby and she is raised by Deirdre and her husband, Ken Barlow (William Roache), who adopts her. Ken and Deirdre separate in December 1989 when Ken has an affair with Wendy Crozier (Roberta Kerr), his secretary at the Weatherfield Recorder. Initially, Tracy supports Deirdre, but above all else, Tracy wants a return to family life. Once Ken sees the error of his ways and begins seeking a reconciliation, in opposition to Deirdre who wants a divorce, Tracy's allegiance shifts to Ken. Deirdre is subjected to further resentment when she takes up with Dave Barton (David Beckett), who rescues Tracy when she accidentally sets the kitchen on fire. The divorce even affects Tracy's school life as Ken gets a teaching job there in 1990, as he can stay updated on Deirdre's exploits through Tracy. Caught between Ken and Deirdre, Tracy starts to rebel by playing truant from school, going instead to the amusement arcade with twin brothers Steve (Simon Gregson) and Andy McDonald (Nicholas Cochrane). 1991 also sees Tracy get her first boyfriend, Graham Egerton (Paul Aspden), but it does not last long and they end their relationship. Tracy meets Robert Preston (Julian Kay), and they decide to marry in 1996. They intend to marry in London, where they are living but on telling Ken and Deirdre the news, Tracy decides to marry in Weatherfield instead, on the cheap; she books the Register Office immediately and buys a ¬£14 wedding dress from a charity shop. The wedding is a success and Robert and Tracy return to London. Tracy visits Weatherfield three times over the next few years: she comes to Deirdre and her fianc√©, Jon Lindsay's (Owen Aaronovitch) engagement party in 1997 and approves of Jon (who is really a confidence man), and then in 1999, she seeks refuge in Weatherfield after falling out with Robert, who accused Tracy of having an affair with her friend after he saw them kissing. Robert follows Tracy to Weatherfield and they reconcile when he accepts her story that she and Dan are just friends. Tracy is delighted when Ken and Deirdre finally reconcile. =2002‚Äì2007= Tracy returns on Christmas Day 2002, claiming that Robert has cheated on her but it emerges that she was sleeping with Robert's best friend; so she and Robert divorce. Tracy has a brief fling with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) but when she realises Dev thinks she is not \\"marriage material\\", she dumps him before cutting up his suits and stealing his credit card. In August 2003, Tracy places a bet with Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) that she can sleep with married Roy Cropper (David Neilson). She spikes his drink and then claims they slept together when he wakes up in her bed the next morning. Roy is racked with guilt and his wife Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) is heartbroken and when Tracy discovers she is pregnant, she threatens to have an abortion unless Roy and Hayley buy the baby for ¬£15,000. With Hayley being a transwoman, they agree, much to the disgust of the Barlow family. Roy and Hayley worry Tracy will flee with their money and the baby so Roy marries Tracy to gain legal rights to the baby. In February 2004, after delivering her daughter, whom Roy and Hayley name Patience, Tracy wants her daughter back and admits at Steve and Karen Phillips' (Suranne Jones) wedding that Steve is her daughter's biological father, not Roy and she lied about them having sex. Not surprisingly, this causes a feud between her and Karen but Roy is persuaded by Ken to return Tracy's daughter, whom she renames Amy (Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike). Tracy taunts Karen when she does not get pregnant as quickly as Tracy did, calling her \\"Barren\\" Karen. Karen does get pregnant but miscarries soon after in December 2004. Karen struggles to cope and finds Tracy's sympathy harder to cope with than her taunting, leading her to steal and torch Tracy's car. Tracy is devastated, thinking Amy is dead because she was in the car, and angrily goes after Karen, threatening to kill her. Only Steve's insistence that Amy is safe with Roy and Hayley, makes Tracy stop and he ends his marriage to Karen, reminding her that he is grieving too and could have lost two children. Tracy watches triumphantly as Karen leaves and Steve tries to reconcile with Tracy but realises he wants Amy, not her. This leads to a bitter custody battle, with Tracy making it look as if Steve tried to kidnap Amy and even accusing him of abusing her. While Tracy wins primary custody, the judge does not believe her accusations and allows Steve visits with Amy. Short-lived flings with Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and Nathan Harding (Ray Fearon) follow, until Tracy starts to date Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) in December 2005. However, Charlie has a one-night stand with his ex-girlfriend, Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay), ultimately resulting in her pregnancy. Though Tracy forgives Charlie, he betrays her again with Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie). Tracy concocts a plan for revenge, spreading lies that Charlie is abusing her while suggesting to Charlie that she is cheating. When Charlie decides to throw Tracy out, she announces her intention to kill him, which he does not believe. In January 2007, she seduces him, then hits him twice on the head with a metal ornament, taunting him as she does; she tries to convince the police that it was self-defence but fails and is charged with murder after Charlie dies. Tracy is released on bail and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) gives the police a statement, claiming to have witnessed the murder in return for sleeping with Tracy, which she does, desperate to avoid going to prison. He lies under oath but his evidence is dismissed by the court and, following Tracy's confession to Deirdre that the murder was planned, Deirdre is unconvincing as a witness. Consequently, Tracy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 15 years before parole. In financial ruin, Ken and Deirdre cannot pay for an appeal, leaving Tracy to serve her sentence, while Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) is sent to live with Steve. =2010‚Äì= In May 2010, Tracy is allowed a day release from prison to attend Deirdre's mother Blanche Hunt's (Maggie Jones) funeral. While at the funeral she argues with Steve's wife, Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) when she realises that Becky is playing a mother figure to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney). On Christmas Eve 2010, Tracy returns to the Street. She tells the Barlows that the expert who handled the forensic evidence for her trial falsified his qualifications so she has been released on bail, pending a retrial. Tracy is found not guilty at the retrial, owing to the unreliability of forensic evidence. On her return, Tracy begins a feud with Becky, regularly taunting her over her inability to give Steve a child. She antagonizes several residents on the street, seduces David and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), and demands access to Amy against Steve and Becky's wishes. Just after midnight on New Year's Day 2011, Tracy is attacked on the back porch of Ken and Dierdre's home by an unseen assailant and put into a coma. Several street residents are suspects including Steve, Becky, Nick, David, and Gail Platt (Helen Worth). After waking from her coma, Tracy names Becky as her assailant, but it is revealed to be Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth). Claire turns herself into the police but when she is released on bail, flees the country with her two sons. Becky refuses to tell Tracy where Claire went, so her plans for revenge are in vain. Tracy learns that Becky stole ¬£5,000 from the Corner Shop on the night of the tram crash to buy Max Turner from his mother Kylie (Paula Lane). She takes Amy to move in with her in exchange for her not going to social services and Steve is forced to acquiesce. As Becky and Tracy's feud intensifies, Steve and Becky's marriage disintegrates and he and Tracy begin a relationship. She becomes pregnant with twins. Steve and Becky go into business together and they meet with a hotel manager. Tracy believes they are having an affair and follows them to the hotel but is unable to find them and has a miscarriage. She confronts Becky over her and Steve but Becky insists that nothing happened. Tracy intentionally falls down the stairs in Becky's house but lies to Steve that Becky pushed her down the stairs and caused the miscarriage. Dierdre discovers Tracy's lies but Tracy insists that she loves Steve and convinces Dierdre to keep quiet. Steve and Tracy's relationship is cemented and Becky is ostracized by the street. Steve proposes to her on Christmas Day and they marry after his divorce with Becky is finalized. Becky crashes the reception at the Rovers with a copy of Tracy's medical records, proving that she lied about being pushed down the stairs and miscarrying. Furious, Steve breaks up with her but is unable to legally end the marriage until after a year or kick her out of the house as it is in both their names. Tracy begins dating Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis). Rob and Tracy then buy the bookmakers' and turn it into a pawnbroker's shop. Tracy is furious when Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) tells her that Rob kissed Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), and that his elder sister Carla Connor (Alison King) knew about it. Rob attacks Tina in her own home, leading to her running to the balcony, where the argument continues. He tries to persuade Tina not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter ‚Äì unaware that Peter has told her himself ‚Äì to save her feelings, and threatens her not to say anything to the police about their dealings with Tony. Tina refuses, so as Rob pushes her away, Tina loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob believes that Tina is dead, so leaves her flat panic-stricken. He then hears Tina's groans and realises that she is still alive. Tina threatens to tell the police that Rob pushed her from the balcony on purpose, in an attempt to kill her. This pushes Rob over the edge, leading to him picking up a metal pipe and beating her with it. Tracy is happy that Tina has been hospitalised, as she hated her. When Tina dies, however, she is slightly more sympathetic. Rob calls her from a B&B;, admits to killing Tina. He tells Tracy he is running out of money and Tracy agrees to bring some to him, which she takes out of their wedding cards. Tracy and Rob meet, she gives him the money but upon saying goodbye decides she wants to go on the run with him. They plan for her to collect their things and meet the following evening. She meets Rob and he says they have to get away quickly, but Tracy cries and tells him she is sorry. She has called the police and told them where he would be, as she realised she could not leave Amy and knew that she did not want to be in prison again. Rob is shocked and devastated, telling her she had a choice, and she could have chosen him. He is led away by police. Tracy starts an affair with Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who is in a relationship with Steve's mother Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) but tells Liz about it before Steve and Michelle Connor's (Kym Marsh) wedding in May 2015, in which she becomes more jealous about Carla and seeks revenge, that night Tracy sneaks into Carla's flat and tries killing her however she hears someone go to the toilet, who unbeknown to her is Amy, and leaves a candle which she lit to guide her way around the flat near a lamp and runs out causing a fire. Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) sees the fire and breaks into the flat and manages to get Carla out before her fianc√© Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry) arrives and manages to get Leanne and Amy out before the flat explodes killing him and also Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly). As Tracy is nowhere to be seen everyone blames Carla for the fire, making Tracy happy. Tracy is distraught when Deirdre dies. At Deirdre's funeral, Ken snaps at her after learning that Deirdre wouldn't come home as she felt ashamed of what Tracy's done. Tracy storms out and her ex-husband Robert (now played by Tristan Gemmill) follows. Back at the house, Robert and Tracy admit there are still feelings between them both and Tracy tries to seduce him. However, Ken decides to give Tracy another chance and goes round to sort things out, only to find Robert and Tracy half-dressed. Ken throws Robert out and lashes out at a guilt-stricken Tracy. Ken later argues with Tracy saying she was the reason Deirdre didn't come home. Tracy later opens her own florist and calls it \\"Prestons Petals\\" in a bid to win Robert back; however, she later finds out Robert slept with Carla and she threatens her. Tracy later collapses due to her kidney and is hospitalised. She is discharged from the hospital. In March 2017, Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant (see Who Attacked Ken?), however, the police suspect one of the Barlow family members. Tracy opens his will whilst he is in hospital and finds out that she has been left nothing by him, but unknown to her, Ken changed it and was given everything to her. In April 2017, after Luke breaks up with her due to suspicion he believes something is going on with her Tracy meets with Rob who is out of prison somehow and it becomes apparent she was with him the night Ken was pushed. In a conversation between them both, it is revealed Rob has been in contact with Tracy and that she has been helping him as he has escaped from prison after being transferred and the car he was in crashed. A few days later they have sex after Rob tells her he will move away and Tracy says she wants to live with him. In May 2017, after Tracy goes on the run with Rob taking Amy who is unaware Rob is with them, with her to a Peak District cottage, they are reported as missing people after Adam finds Tracy has taken Amy's passport and tells Steve. The next day, Amy runs away and rings Steve letting the police track down where she phoned. When she comes back from the call she walks in on Tracy and Rob kissing just before he sees the police coming up to the cottage. Tracy pleads with Amy not to tell anyone they have been with Rob and sends her with him so he can take her home before he continues his journey on the run. Tracy tells Rob she is covering for Amy, who she believes pushed Ken and they share a goodbye. When the armed police arrive she tells them it was her who pushed him and they arrest her for attempted murder. In court Rob storms in and tells Tracy and the courtroom, that it wasn't Amy who pushed Ken so she retracts her statement and pleads not guilty after Rob gives her an alibi saying she was with him the night Ken was pushed. She then meets with Rob in her cell for the last time before he is moved to solitary, and they have to say goodbye before having sex. She is released from prison a few days later. In June 2017, she later discovers Ken's son Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) was the culprit who pushed Ken, and she is furious and she disowns him. Over Christmas, she rekindles her relationship with Steve. In January 2018, Tracy is left distraught when ex-boyfriend Luke Britton is murdered by Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). Steve proposes to Tracy and she accepts. Around the same time Tracy becomes close with Abi Franklin (Sally Carman). On the wedding day, Tracy suspects Steve of having an affair with Abi which she denies but Tracy tampers with a car Abi is meant to be fixing, as she is a mechanic. She later finds out Steve didn't sleep with Abi and asks her to be a maid of honour again. As Tracy walks down the aisle she tells Leanne, \\"I‚Äôm coming for you bitch‚Äù unaware Leanne has recently slept with Steve. After marrying Steve Leanne tries to apologize for sleeping with Steve when Tracy was actually just mad at her for not letting Leanne and Steve's son Oliver Battersby wear a kilt meaning that Leanne has accidentally revealed the one night stand to Tracy. Tracy and Leanne have a fight after she punches Steve, who she tells she wants a divorce, however after getting drunk Tracy goes on her honeymoon to Morocco with him. She returns over a week later telling everyone that she has left Steve in the desert and took his passport with her. She finds out that the car she tampered with was involved in an accident which left Ryan Connor (Ryan Prescott) in a coma and Leanne badly injured as well as Cormac Truman dead as the car, Michelle's car broke down allowing Truman to get to them. Abi is blamed for not fixing the car properly and when the police want to look at Kevin Webster‚Äôs (Michael Le Vell) laptop for CCTV, Tracy steals Abi‚Äôs keys for the garage and steals the laptop. Amy later tells Tracy and Steve that she is pregnant at the age of 14 years old and when Tracy learns that the father is at the legal age of consent, she pressures Amy to have an abortion. After deep thought, Amy is adamant that she wants to keep the baby and refuses to have an abortion and so Tracy has a plan with Steve to adopt the baby and raise it as their own. However, Amy later feels emotionally neglected by Tracy and Steve and has a secret abortion with Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) by her side without both Tracy and Steve's knowledge. Tracy later learns about the abortion and admits to the realisation that she has neglected Amy's emotional wellbeing over the baby. Casting Christabel Finch (right) and Holly Chamarette (left) as Tracy Barlow. Tracy was created as the daughter of Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) and Ray Langton (Neville Buswell). The first actress to play Tracy was Christabel Finch in 1977, who first appeared in the role when she was 15 days old. According to Finch in 2007, \\"It was a case of being the right baby, in the right place, at the right time. The casting director came to the baby unit and picked me at random, then asked my parents if I could be in the show.\\" In 2001 Finch reflected on her time in the soap, remembering that she used to share a dressing room with Anne Kirkbride who plays Tracy's mother Deirdre and one of her most prominent storyline memories is her involvement in Deirdre's affair with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs): \\"Because I was a kid, everyone was really friendly to me. Julie Goodyear, who played Bet Gilroy, was really lovely and a very down-to-earth person. The biggest plot I was involved in was when Deirdre had an affair with Mike Baldwin. There was a lot of shouting going on and Ken was screaming at her, 'Get out of the house!' I just thought, 'what's going on, why are they shouting?'\\" Finch left the role when she was seven as her parents had opted to move to Guernsey. It was two years until the producers recast Tracy. On screen during that time, Tracy's parents Ken and Deirdre would say that Tracy was either in her room upstairs or at school. Eight-year-old Holly Chamarette was given the role in 1985. At the time she reportedly commented, \\"I'm thrilled. I've been watching Coronation Street for ages.\\" She was chosen from more than 60 children, but left the role when she was 11 in 1988, quitting the acting profession to become a doctor. The third actress to play the part was Dawn Acton, appearing between 1988 and 1999. Acton was 11 when she took on the role and played the character through her teenage years, in what Acton has described as Tracy's tarty phase. Acton has said that Tracy's appearances became rare in the mid 1990s, until the casting director James Bain informed her that her contract was not being renewed as \\"the storylines involving Tracy had dried up\\". Acton adds, \\"I was 17 but I wasn't devastated. There were no tantrums, like the ones Tracy was famous for. James said I should try other things in the acting world. I did ‚Äì but it didn't work out.\\" In November 2002, it was reported that Dawn Acton reauditioned for the role of Tracy but was unsuccessful which resulted in the role being given to Kate Ford. A spokeswoman for the soap said: \\"[Kate] is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially in the past four years and really hits the ground running. Kate is thrilled.\\" Discussing why Acton was not brought back, a spokesperson said, \\"We [looked] at other actresses because the character has changed so much‚Äîshe's going to be explosive.\\" Ford was a fan of the show as a child, and revealed that when she was 12, she wrote around ten letters to the casting director requesting a part. The character is portrayed as being extremely selfish and dangerous. She appears to be a tough, fiery and very bitchy character, with actress Kate Ford stating that \\"underneath she does care about her daughter which does show a soft side to her\\". Development=Reintroduction (2002)= On 23 October 2002, it was reported that Tracy would be reintroduced later that year. A show spokesman says the new Tracy will be sexy, sassy and opinionated. She will make a beeline for womanising bookie Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), her own stepbrother, before moving on to former sailor Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and knicker factory boss Joe Carter (Jonathan Wrather). Tracy returns home to Weatherfield at Christmas after turning to her mother, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), when her marriage breaks down - she left the Street after marrying Robert Preston (Julian Kay) at Weatherfield Register Office. The character was last played by Dawn Acton. A Coronation Street spokesman said: \\"We are looking at other actresses because the character has changed so much - she's going to be explosive.\\" Explaining the decision to bring Tracy back as an antagonist, writer Daran Little commented: \\"You only have to look at a character whose parents got divorced when she was very young and then pulled either way to find out this woman is very flawed and has a chip on her shoulder. So you take that and bring her back a few years later as a very selfish person.\\" On 13 November 2002, it was announced that Kate Ford had been cast as Tracy. It was reported that Acton was said to be \\"devastated\\" when she failed to win the part, which instead went to Ford. But whereas Tracy Barlow was a glum-faced teenager, Tracy Preston - as she is now called - is a sexy, sassy and opinionated man-eater. At the same time it was also reported that Tracy would sleep with her mother's former flame Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). A Coronation Street spokeswoman said Ford, fresh from London's Webber Douglas Academy but originally from north Lancashire, was \\"thrilled\\" to have landed the role. \\"She is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially in the past four years and really hits the ground running. Kate is thrilled.\\" Tracy returned on-screen on 25 December 2002, and she spent no time moping over her failed marriage. \\"She's been bored in London and she's ready to let her hair down and have some fun. Tracy's a strong, feisty woman and I think at last Dev may have met his match.\\" =Pregnancy= A storyline involving Tracy in 2003 saw her have a one-night stand with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and wanted to take things further but Steve got back together with his wife Karen (Suranne Jones) instead. In need of an ego boost, Tracy bet Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) 1p that she could bed Roy Cropper (David Neilson), to prove that she could have any man she wanted. Tracy won the bet by subterfuge - drugging Roy. A few weeks later Tracy found out she was pregnant and booked an abortion. Her original intent was to keep quiet but, when confronted by a furious Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), Tracy blurted out that she was pregnant with Roy's baby. As Roy and Hayley couldn't have children and longed for one, Tracy suggested that they adopt her baby for ¬£20,000. The Croppers agreed but tried to persuade Tracy to marry Roy to guarantee his parental rights. Faced with a legal bill from her divorce from Robert, Tracy agreed, marrying Roy with Hayley and Ciaran as their witnesses. The conclusion of the storyline saw Tracy give birth to baby daughter Amy in February 2004, who was revealed to be Steve's child and not Roy's, leaving Tracy to later go on to have a fight with Steve's wife Karen. =Departure (2007)= In 2005, Ford made the decision to leave the serial, but after being promised more \\"juicier storylines\\", she decided to stay. In January 2006, it was reported by the News of the World, that Ford had again insisted that she will bow out next year when her contract expires. A Coronation Street spokesman told Digital Spy: \\"Kate is contracted until next Spring so she's with us for the foreseeable future.\\" Bill Ward who plays Charlie Stubbs, the boyfriend of Tracy announced his departure from the serial in June 2006, an ITV spokesperson commented: \\"Contrary to press reports Bill‚Äôs decision to leave is not linked to the future of the character of Tracy Barlow. Actress Kate Ford is contracted to Coronation Street until March 2007.\\" After months of speculation, Ford announced in August 2006 that she is to quit the show next year. Talking of her decision to leave, she told The Sun: \\"It has been the best time of my life, playing Tracy Barlow. I cannot wait to see what the writers have got in store for her.\\" Producer Steve Frost confirmed that Tracy would not be killed off in her exit. \\"Kate will be involved in a major storyline which will see her leave next spring,\\" he said. \\"Kate is a great asset. Her character Tracy has left the cobbles before and we hope she‚Äôll return one day.\\" Tracy kills Charlie Stubbs with a metal sculpture which leads to her eventual departure (2007) It was announced that Tracy would kill Charlie as part of Ford and Ward's leaving storylines which saw Tracy sentenced to life imprisonment for Charlie's murder. Brian Capron, who played notorious serial killer Richard Hillman from 2001 to 2003, warned Ford and Ward that the murder plot could harm their careers due to the storyline being so high-profile. Ford promised that it's a fitting end for the Street's resident love rat. \\"Charlie has had this smug attitude that he can do whatever he wants and it has just driven Tracy insane,\\" she said. \\"He lives by the sword and dies by the sword. I don‚Äôt think there's a man Tracy‚Äôs met who's going to get the better of her. She hates what he's turned her into and wants him to die after he continually cheated on her.\\" Ward commented: \\"He doesn‚Äôt believe that Tracy would actually go through with murder and thinks himself much smarter. \\"Charlie has long suspected that Tracy was concocting something evil, and when she reveals her wicked plans he challenges her to go through with it. He doesn‚Äôt believe she would actually go through with it for a second, so when Tracy actually goes for him it‚Äôs a complete shock. She attacks him with such ferocity that he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.\\" The storyline saw Tracy spending weeks staging arguments, locking herself in the house, and even burning herself with an iron, in order to convince neighbour Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) that Charlie is abusing her. Ken and Deirdre are also concerned for Tracy's well-being, but she will not leave Charlie. Tracy gives Charlie a lap dance and begins to tell him they will be together forever. While he is distracted, she hits him over the head with a heavy metal sculpture. She taunts him and then hits him again, with a fatal blow. This resulted in Charlie ending up in hospital in a coma. Tracy, meanwhile, is successfully granted bail following an intense grilling by detectives. She ignores her bail conditions and sneaks to the hospital where she leans over an unconscious Charlie urging him to hurry up and die. ‚ÄúWhen Tracy finds out that Charlie hasn‚Äôt died straight away she's terrified that he might actually wake up and tell the cops the truth,\\" Ford revealed. \\"She planned to kill him so knowing he's still alive puts her into a panic. She orders Deirdre to take her to the hospital where she wishes her cheating boyfriend would hurry up and die. It‚Äôs a really worrying time for Tracy as she's desperate to cover her tracks and not be charged with murder. Ford added: ‚ÄúAs far as Tracy‚Äôs concerned Charlie was trying to kill her and that‚Äôs what she has told everybody. But if Charlie comes to and tells the truth, Tracy will almost certainly be done for attempted murder.‚Äù Charlie later ends up dying in hospital much to the relief of Tracy. Coronation Street broadcast an episode on 25 March 2007, which only featured Ford and Kirkbride who played Tracy's mother Deirdre, this was the first episode to feature only two actors since Kevin Kennedy and Sarah Lancashire who played Curly and Raquel Watts in 2000. The episode saw Tracy confess all to Deirdre. Speaking of the episode, Ford said: \\"Deirdre‚Äôs been asking questions and Tracy knows she‚Äôs onto her. Also Tracy‚Äôs feeling the pressure and she needs to confide in someone after keeping it to herself for so long. It‚Äôs all too much, so when the big confrontation comes Tracy lets go and confesses to Deirdre that she murdered Charlie in cold blood. She feels like she wants to take the weight off her. For months she‚Äôs been carrying round this big secret and she needs to offload it, especially now Deirdre‚Äôs sniffing around. Also, Deirdre intimates that she would lie for her so Tracy‚Äôs quite confident that she can freely offload.\\" Ford added: \\"She forces her word that she won‚Äôt tell anyone and that she‚Äôll back her in court, but Deirdre‚Äôs wavering. She‚Äôs appalled and wants Tracy to come clean, but she‚Äôs also her child, her own flesh and blood, so it‚Äôs hard to consider giving her up. Tracy expects that as her mum Deirdre will stick by her whatever. It was amazing to be able to do an entire episode just with the two of us. I love working with Anne and this was a fantastic opportunity to explore the relationship between the two of them.‚Äù Tracy's trial aired in March 2007 and the jury delivered the \\"guilty\\" verdict, resulting in Tracy being sentenced to life imprisonment. Ford's final episode as Tracy was broadcast on 8 April 2007. When asked by itv.com in 2013 whether Tracy would ever be driven to kill again, Ford replied: \\"I don't think she ever wants to go back to prison, she absolutely hated it, so for that reason no. Also I think she was in such a dark place when she was with Charlie, I don't think she just killed him for the sake of it, she'd gone a bit mental because he was playing games with her head.\\" =Reintroduction (2010)= On 5 January 2010, it was announced that Ford would reprise the role of Tracy after more than three years away. The actress attributed her return in part to the 2009 return of her friend Shobna Gulati as Sunita Alahan, and her desire to work with Gulati again. Ford believes that the time she has spent in prison has made Tracy's attitude worse, characterising her as \\"a bit cagey and a bit bitter\\". She stated that Tracy still loves Steve, but that his new wife Becky would beat her in a fight. Her first scenes were shown in May, when she returned for her grandmother Blanche's funeral. Ford found the scenes difficult to film, following the then recent death of Maggie Jones who played Blanche. She described Tracy as a more ruthless and extreme version of her grandmother. Kate Ford admitted that she was nervous about her return to the serial. Tracy returned to Weatherfield on a permanent basis later in 2010. The storyline depicting her initial return involved her being offered an early release in exchange for extracting a murder confession from Gail. She falsely accused Gail of her husband Joe McIntyre's (Reece Dinsdale) murder, by telling the police that she hit him with a rolling pin, after Gail told her that she hid a rolling pin on top of a bedroom wardrobe in order to stop poor cook Joe from baking potato pie. The police subsequently found the rolling pin hidden in the house, making Tracy's lie appear true. Tracy decided to testify in court, alleging that Gail was guilty of murdering Joe; Gail was found not guilty of murder and Tracy was furious that she might not be let out early, thus throwing a chair across the room at two police officers who were involved in Gail's case. Later that day, Tracy was attacked by Gail's fellow inmates after they threw water at her and locked her in a cell and beat her up for being a \\"grass\\". Tracy was hospitalised. Executive producer Phil Collinson has revealed that Tracy's return will bring a few years' worth of storylines for her and many other characters in the soap, and that there is a possibility of Becky McDonald and Tracy appearing in a special two-hander episode. It was revealed on 4 October, that Tracy would return on Christmas Eve 2010, following her shock release from prison. Speaking to Inside Soap, Ford said: \\"Tracy's absolutely ecstatic to be out of prison, and excited to be home. She's a bit nervous because she knows everybody is going to hate her - but she's basically the same old Tracy!\\" Ford added: \\" she wants Amy back, but she'd like to be with Steve as well. She wants them to be a family. Steve is Tracy's true love, and she'd do anything to Becky if it meant she could have him.\\" Speaking to Soaplife about Tracy's comeback, Simon Gregson who plays Steve McDonald explained: \\"I'm really excited. Tracy's a brilliant character. You've got that lightness and then pure evil. And Kate (Ford) does such a good deadpan face. I sometimes have to struggle not to laugh. Her return is a massive shock. Steve instantly thinks, 'Oh no!' He just knows she'll be bringing him loads of flack.\\" Discussing Tracy's demands for custody of Amy, Gregson continued: \\"Tracy's got [Steve] over a barrel. It turns out Amy's heard Steve and Becky talking about buying Max and she's told Tracy. \\"That's all the ammunition she needs. She tells Steve if she doesn't get custody she'll shop him and Becky to the authorities.\\" Tracy returns just as the tram crash memorial service is taking place. By the end of Christmas Eve, she has managed to alienate most of the community, particularly Gail McIntyre and the recently widowed Claire Peacock. On 30 December 2010, after Tracy has complained to Deirdre, Ken, and Peter about being deprived of sex, David Platt confronts her at home about her conduct towards his mother. After a bitter argument, Tracy seduces David. Shortly afterward, Tracy sleeps with Nick Tilsley (Ben Price); they are discovered by Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). On New Year's Eve, Deirdre and Ken find Tracy unconscious with a head injury. Suspicion falls on Steve, who is standing nearby with blood on his hands. On 19 May 2011, Ford revealed that the main thing driving her Coronation Street alter-ego Tracy Barlow is the desire to have a family with daughter Amy and former husband, Steve. Speaking to TV Times, Ford said that Tracy is feeling as if her meddling is starting to pay off. \\"She thinks she can see a shift in Steve, and she knows that his and Becky's relationship is not on firm ground. She's excited because she thinks an opportunity might be presenting itself,\\" Ford explained. \\"All Tracy wants is for her, Amy and Steve to be a family. She sees that as the key to her fulfilment and happiness. She does love Amy and she's really worried about her mystery illness. When it comes down to it, she will put Amy above anything.\\" =Rob Donovan= In December 2012, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy begin a dangerous relationship with Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), the brother of Carla Connor (Alison King). Speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street source said: \\"Tracy and Rob are a match made in soap hell, They will be fiery, passionate and out to cause trouble.\\" Baylis went on to say: \\"Watch this space ‚Äì interestingly, Tracy Barlow comes onto his radar. Tracy was one of the suspects in the \\"Who Killed Tina?\\" campaign as part of Michelle Keegan's (pictured) departure which saw her character Tina McIntyre murdered. That is an interesting combination. Without a doubt, he sees something of himself in Tracy and finds her intriguing!\\" Ford admitted: \\"She [Tracy] likes the fact that he's quite feisty ‚Äì it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!\\" Asked about the kind of a dynamic between Rob and Tracy, Baylis told Digital Spy: \\"There's a lot of joyful banter - they challenge each other in a fun way. They're quite similar, they can see those similarities and they do have a lot of fun together. They put a smile on each other's faces, and we'll just have to see how it goes from there.\\" Asked if Rob can hold his own when it comes to Tracy, Baylis replied: \\"\\"Definitely, otherwise he wouldn't get involved. He is aware of the whole situation that happened with Ryan last year, but he's got a few more years on Ryan and he's been round the block a few times. Rob definitely wouldn't get involved in something that he didn't think he could handle. But Rob does have an arrogant side, and he feels like he could deal with anything. That's one of Rob's main flaws. I've really enjoyed working with Kate Ford on the storyline - we've had an absolute blast. We've been working a lot together, and hopefully the working relationship that we've built up behind the scenes will come across on screen. I'm looking forward to seeing that unfold myself.\\" When asked how Rob first gets Tracy's attention, Ford told All About Soap: \\"Well, Tracy's going off shopping in town and she gets into a taxi at exactly the same time as Rob. She demands that he leave, as it's her taxi and not his. He refuses to move though, and when Steve asks them where they're going and they both say the city centre at the same time, they share a smile and end up going in the cab together. She likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!\\" Ford also stated that not only is Tracy attracted to Rob, she realises that it would also annoy Michelle (Kym Marsh), adding: \\"If he had got out of the taxi, she probably wouldn't have fancied him. He's quite easy on the eye too, of course. Plus, he hangs round with Michelle, and if Tracy and Rob were an item, it would annoy her - that's another good reason for Tracy.\\" On Tracy's reaction to being asked out by Rob, she said: \\"She's quite annoyed at first and she turns him down. But he persists and he flatters her, so she thinks, why not? I think he's like a nicer version of Charlie, so maybe. He's got the bad lad streak, he's ruthless, but he's nowhere near as cruel as Charlie.\\" Tracy convinces Rob to give her a job at Underworld, and when factory boss Carla has doubts over the arrangement, the Tracy promises to behave herself. However, in an interview with The Sun, Ford confirmed that Tracy won't be able to resist winding up her new co-workers. Ford explained: \\"She loves to p*** everyone off. She annoys Michelle, she annoys Eva and she likes that.\\" Discussing her alter ego's nasty nature, the Ford admitted: \\"She is so vile. Sometimes when she is being really horrid, I ask everyone, 'Why is Tracy so horrible?' and they all go, 'Because she is horrid!' It's as if she is unhappy with her own life and so she is awful to everyone else. \\"But I do love playing Tracy and I am always so grateful that I have been given this role. I have such a brilliant time on set and there are never any rows because we all have such a laugh.\\" Ford also insisted that Tracy does have the potential to settle down with one man. She said: \\"I will leave the writers to come up with the storylines for Tracy. But I do think she could stay with anybody - so long as they let her behave a little bit badly. The reason why she stayed with Charlie [Stubbs] is because she couldn't walk all over him. But who knows what will happen with Tracy in the future?\\" It was announced that Tracy will put her relationship with Rob before her own daughter as she tries to secure more commitment from him. Tracy decides that she wants to live with Rob, but she knows that he may need some convincing as he is not ready to be a stepfather to Amy. Tracy's interfering stepbrother, Peter, is responsible for planting the idea in Tracy's head, questioning why she hasn't moved in with Rob now that they have a business together. Ford told itv.com: \\"It definitely strikes a nerve when Peter says that Rob will never see her that way and only cares about himself. Tracy is willing to do anything to move in with Rob, even if it means palming Amy off on Steve and her mum more often. She knows one of the reasons Rob's reluctant to move in with her is because he fears he won't be a good stepdad to Amy, and that's not really the life he wants right now. So to solve this problem, she persuades Steve to have Amy four nights a week and Deirdre the other three.\\" Ford added: \\"Tracy is very good at twisting people round her finger. Rob's got everything she wants in a man - he's ambitious and driven, he shares her ruthless streak.\\" A twist in Tracy and Rob's relationship storyline happened when Rob later went to kiss Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Asked why they end up kissing each other, Baylis replied: \\"They're playing games with each other. The thing with Rob is that he can't resist a challenge. He'll always rise to the bait, and Tina challenges him. They're both pushing each other while they are flirting and it's all about game playing. That's how it happens.\\" Tracy later finds out about their kiss and is furious, beginning a feud with her and Tina; which would later build up to the departure of Keegan and the murder of Tina for which Tracey was a suspect. Kate Ford, said: \\"Tracy has committed murder before and got away with it and she certainly takes no prisoners when it comes to getting revenge on people who have wronged her. She has never really forgiven Tina for kissing Rob and trying to take him off her - and for her campaign to try and close down Barlow's Buys when they first opened. Now that she knows Tina has rumbled their dodgy dealings with Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), it may be that she thinks enough is enough and slips away from her engagement party to confront her - but Tina is every bit as feisty and Tracy might have bitten off more than she can chew trying to keep her quiet.\\" It was later revealed that it wasn't Tracy who killed Tina and in fact it was Rob who killed her. As the storyline concluded Rob was sent to prison leaving Tracy relieved. =Tony Stewart= In December 2014, it was revealed that Tracy was to have an affair with Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) who is in a relationship with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard). Maynard explained: \\"Tracy is at her lowest ebb. She's broken and she needs validating in some way by a man. She's realized that she's all alone and that she's not going to have a relationship with Rob as he's locked up for life. she thinks that she'll be older and nobody will be interested in her. Tony tells Tracy what she wants to hear, because he does feel for her. He tells her that she looks good, that there are loads of men that would want her. That's when Tracy turns to him and asks him if he'd go there with her. Tony refuses to answer and tells her he's with Liz and that he can't answer that question. Tony makes a point of telling Tracy he's happy with Liz and he puts his cards on the table. But Tracy still comes on strong because she needs this - this is something she needs to stabilise her. If she had a good friend that she could cry to and could go to, this might not be happening - but she needs a sexual validation, so it becomes about power.\\" Tracy was involved in an affair with Tony Stewart, the boyfriend of Liz McDonald played by Beverley Callard (pictured). Asked whether Tony pulls back when Tracy first tries to kiss him, Maynard replied: \\"He tries to. When she starts kissing him, he is completely disengaged and tries to turn away from her. But there's no doubt about it that there's an attraction to Tracy and he can't deny it. With her coming on so strong, he can't help himself. I think he likes how much of a challenge she's becoming too. He feels lousy afterwards. I think he has concern for what will happen now and for what will happen with Liz. He hopes that's the end of it and that it won't spill out into the public domain. He genuinely loves Liz and he hasn't felt like this about a woman for a very long time so he doesn't want to lose it. He wants to just forget it and move on but it's evident that Tracy isn't going to let it go. From Tony's point of view it's about managing her and playing the game - he wants the business and that's still all he wants.\\" Writers confirmed that the pair's romantic spark wouldn't be just be a one-off, so Tony's attraction to Tracy could grow as time goes on. Maynard added: \\"He's not in love with her and they're not the same sort of feelings that he has for Liz, but I think he considers Tracy to be a friend of his and I think the feelings he does have for her could well grow.\\" Ford said that Tracy could have met her match in Tony after he sets her up. Tracy agrees to go into business with Tony when he masterminds a situation that leaves her shaken, forcing her to reconsider her options. Tracy is left feeling threatened by a supplier after buying some dodgy stock, only to be rescued by Tony, who is hoping to finally get his hands on the business. Ford said: \\"When it all goes wrong she's terrified. When he turns violent, she realises it could have gone massively wrong if Tony hadn't come in. She is quite good at protecting herself - she's been in prison so she can handle herself, but she is shaken.\\" However, although Tracy believes she can keep Tony at arm's length once they become business partners, Ford thinks her alter ego could have her work cut out. She said: \\"Tracy can kind of see through Tony. She is a big girl and she can look after herself. It's more about the money and the fact that she can't cope without him financially. She doesn't think of Tony as her saviour, it's all about the money. Tracy can be pretty ruthless herself so maybe she'll have to play Tony at his own game. I think she's going to have her work cut out though this time.\\" Liz later finds out about the affair when Tracy breaks the news to her on the day of Steve and Michelle's wedding. Callard commented: \\"At first Liz doesn't quite believe it. She's not concerned about the dodgy things that Tracy and Tony might get up to at Barlow's Buys, but she doesn't believe Tony would do anything else. Tracy then starts to show her texts which prove they've been having an affair. Liz still doesn't quite believe it, but she soon starts to realise there could be some truth to it. Tracy also tells Liz that they've been trying to get The Rovers from underneath her as well. That just puts the lid on it for Liz, but the one thing she's thinking is that she can't let it ruin the wedding day for Steve and Michelle.\\" =Robert Preston= On 9 May 2015, it was announced that Tristan Gemmill had been cast as Tracy's ex Robert Preston. Robert (then played by Julian Kay) had previously been married to Tracy when Dawn Acton was playing the role. It was announced that Robert will return to Tracy's life in the summer when he turns up unexpectedly at the funeral of her mother Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride). With Tracy grieving following her mother's sudden death and also newly single after splitting from Tony Stewart, she quickly seeks comfort by falling back into Robert's arms. However, if Tracy harbours any hopes for a full reunion with Robert, it won't be easy for her as he is still married to his second wife - something he has neglected to tell her. Played by former Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding, Robert's wife quickly joins him in Weatherfield to fight for her man. Asked what Robert likes about Tracy, Gemmill replied: \\"\\"Now there's a question! I guess some people are attracted to broken people. I've got friends who have poor relationships by anyone's standards because they keep making the same mistake. Maybe Robert is one of those people who is attracted to danger, maybe he thinks he can fix her. There's an element of thrill being with someone who's unpredictable.\\" =Kidney infection= On 16 May 2016, it was reported by the Metro that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy at \\"death's door\\" as her health will take a turn for the worse. It was also revealed that as she faces a fight for life, she may be doing so alone as all of her family will have turned their backs on her in the wake of her feud with Carla. With Tracy only having one kidney, she will end up with an infection. Speaking to Metro.co.uk at a recent press event, Ford explained: \\"She gets an infection and the people that she thinks will be there for her aren‚Äôt and she realises she‚Äôs pushed everyone too far. There'll be a big, bad karma ‚Äì even her daughter who she took for granted doesn‚Äôt want to know. Even Ken has been pushed too far ‚Äì although he does go and see her at the hospital, she is his daughter after all and she is at death's door.\\" Ford also hinted that the terror of the situation might make Tracy change her ways: \\"It's a different Tracy post-this, for quite some time. She realises she has cut off everybody ‚Äì the health issue makes being conniving quite difficult! We won't see as much of that in the future.\\". In an interview with Digital Spy, Ford explained why Tracy only has one kidney: \\"She has only got the one kidney because when she was younger she took an ecstasy tablet in a nightclub and had organ failure. The kidney she's got is Samir Rachid's kidney\\". Ford also went on to explain the storyline in more detail: \\"Tracy gets an infection in her kidney, which means that she becomes very poorly as it isn't functioning properly. She's been feeling pain for a while and feeling tired but she's been taking her medication, so isn't overly worried until she suddenly doubles over in agony in the flower shop. She tries to make light of it when she's referred to the transplant clinic, claiming as soon as she's ill, the doctors always presume it's her kidney. But deep down I think she's more worried than she's letting on.\\" Discussing the aftermath of Tracy's subsequent collapse, Ford confirmed: \\"Well she doesn't die! I think for Tracy the only positive that comes out of it is that she hopes it will bring her and Amy back together. But Amy is quite a tough cookie and she doesn't come to the hospital to see her, even though Tracy is on her deathbed. That really affects Tracy. She's desperate to try to make amends with Amy but it doesn't seem to work. She's very lonely and very emotional when she's at the hospital. Robert visits her and she's hopeful it means they have a future together, but it's not going to be that simple. Especially with Amy, who Tracy fears she may have lost forever.\\". Reception When Tracy was blackmailed by David, Steven Perkins of Lowculture commented: \\"It's very incredibly wrong, and yet they're both so vile that it goes right around the loop and goes back to being a thoroughly great idea.\\" Fellow Lowculture contributor Nick Linsdell praised Tracy as \\"one of the all-time great, completely horrific, self-absorbed soap monsters.\\" He deemed her trial testament to the show's writers, as, even with a character who has been part of Coronation Street since birth: \\"they've come up with an exit storyline that outdoes all her previous exploits and dragged in half the cast to enjoy the fun.\\" Perkins also praised the trial storyline, commenting: \\"It makes for quite a nice change to have sat through a soap trial, knowing for once that The Accused was (a) guilty as sin, (b) acting in a deliberate, calculated and premeditated fashion and (c) not trying to frame someone else.\\" Alongside this unusual premise, he noted: \\"there are probably quite a few people who secretly want to see That Bitch Tracy Barlow finally get hers.\\" Radio Times included Tracy in their feature profiling 'bunny boilers' of soap opera. Discussing her they stated: \\"Qualifying as much as a soap villain as a bunny-boiler, grown-up Tracy in her final incarnation displayed enough deranged behaviour to have Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail bounding for the hills.\\" Opining on her temper they added: \\"Tracy was capable of a rage so hot that, by comparison, the fires of hell were chilly.\\" They also offered their opinion on what could have made her this way, blaming Ken's and Deirdre's behaviour. The character has been dubbed by the media and viewers as, \\"Toxic Tracy\\". A reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2017 named Tracy and Carla's feud as one of the \\"best bits of February\\", describing the pair as \\"sworn enemies\\". They described Tracy confronting Carla as \\"the big moment\\" in the episodes. In February 2011, Ford was nominated for Best Comeback in the Soap Bubble Awards for her portrayal of Tracy. Tracy was nominated in the category of \\"Villain of the Year\\" at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards.

This is usually the result of an un-natural death occurring from events such as an accident, a homicide, or a murder-suicide. Under the common law, if there was any evidence whatsoever that one party had survived the other, even by a few moments, then the estates would be distributed in that order. However, the decedents could write (or have written) a clause in the will that requires their property to be distributed as though each had predeceased the other. Some wills now include Titanic clauses (named for the RMS Titanic, which caused many simultaneous deaths among testators and executors). These clauses lay out explicit instructions for dealing with simultaneous death. United States In order to alleviate problems of proving simultaneous death, many states in the United States have enacted the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act, which provides that each spouse will be treated as though they predeceased the other if they die within 120 hours of one another, unless a specific clause in the will deals with this particular possibility. However, the Act also states that the 120-hour rule is not applicable if the end result would be that the estate is intestate, and would therefore be escheated to the state. England and Wales  The common law provision that, without evidence, there can be no presumption as to which of the commorientes died first, was superseded by the passage of the Law of Property Act 1925, Section 184. Under this statute, where the order of death of two persons is uncertain, the elder of the two is deemed to have died first. This can cause difficulties where for example the elder person had children prior to marriage. The rules can be ousted if inappropriate by an explicit provision in a will. Wills generally have a survivorship clause, typically of 30 days, so that both partner's estates are dealt with as though they were already widowed at the point of death; in cases of intestacy, the survivorship clause is set at 28 days. It is HM Revenue and Customs's longstanding practice to apply a concessionary treatment for inheritance tax purposes in such cases which reduces the burden on surviving family members.

It is a colourless solid that dissolves in polar solvents. It is a strong base that is used in the production of plastics and explosives. It is found in urine as a normal product of protein metabolism. A guanidine moiety also appears in larger organic molecules, including on the side chain of arginine. Structure Guanidine can be thought of as a nitrogenous analogue of carbonic acid. That is, the C=O group in carbonic acid is replaced by a C=NH group, and each OH is replaced by a group. Isobutylene can be seen as the carbon analogue in much the same way. A detailed crystallographic analysis of guanidine was elucidated 148 years after its first synthesis, despite the simplicity of the molecule. In 2013, the positions of the hydrogen atoms and their displacement parameters were accurately determined using single-crystal neutron diffraction. Production Guanidine can be obtained from natural sources, being first isolated by Adolph Strecker via the degradation of guanine. It was first synthesized in 1861 by the oxidative degradation of an aromatic natural product, guanine, isolated from Peruvian guano. A laboratory method of producing guanidine is gentle (180-190 ¬∞C) thermal decomposition of dry ammonium thiocyanate in anhydrous conditions: :3 NH4SCN = 2 CH5N3 + H2S + CS2 The commercial route involves a two step process starting with the reaction of dicyandiamide with ammonium salts. Via the intermediacy of biguanidine, this ammonolysis step affords salts of the guanidinium cation (see below). In the second step, the salt is treated with base, such as sodium methoxide. Chemistry=Guanidinium cation= With a pKb of 0.4, guanidine is a strong base. Most guanidine derivatives are in fact salts containing the conjugate acid. The conjugate acid is called the guanidinium cation, (). This planar, symmetric ion consists of three amino groups each bonded to the central carbon atom with a covalent bond of order 4/3. It is a highly stable +1 cation in aqueous solution due to the efficient resonance stabilization of the charge and efficient solvation by water molecules. As a result, its pKa is 13.6. meaning that guanidine is a very strong base in water; in neutral water, it exists almost exclusively as guanidinium. Image:Guanidinium- ion-3D-balls.pngball-and-stick model Image:Guanidinium- ion-2D-skeletal.pngresonance hybrid Image:Guanidinium-ion-canonical- forms-2D-skeletal.pngcanonical forms =Testing for guanidine= Guanidine can be selectively detected using sodium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid (Folin's reagent) and acidified urea. Uses=Industry= The main salt of commercial interest is the nitrate [C()3]. It is used as a propellant, for example in air bags. =Biochemistry= Guanidine exists protonated, as guanidinium, in solution at physiological pH. Guanidinium chloride (also known as guanidine hydrochloride) has chaotropic properties and is used to denature proteins. Guanidinium chloride is known to denature proteins with a linear relationship between concentration and free energy of unfolding. In aqueous solutions containing 6 M guanidinium chloride, almost all proteins lose their entire secondary structure and become randomly coiled peptide chains. Guanidinium thiocyanate is also used for its denaturing effect on various biological samples. Guanidinium chloride is used as an adjuvant in treatment of botulism, introduced in 1968, but now its role is considered controversial ‚Äì because in some patients there was no improvement after the administration of this drug. =Other= Guanidinium hydroxide is the active ingredient in some non-lye hair relaxers. Guanidine derivatives The general structure of a guanidine Guanidines are a group of organic compounds sharing a common functional group with the general structure . The central bond within this group is that of an imine, and the group is related structurally to amidines and ureas. Examples of guanidines are arginine, triazabicyclodecene, saxitoxin, and creatine. Galegine is isoamylene guanidine.

Constructionism advocates student- centered, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge.Alesandrini, K. & Larson, L. (2002). Teachers bridge to constructivism. The Clearing House, 119‚Äì121. Students learn through participation in project-based learning where they make connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge facilitated by the teacher through coaching rather than using lectures or step-by-step guidance. Further, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with experiential learning and builds on Jean Piaget's epistemological theory of constructivism.Cakir, M. (2008). Constructivist Approaches to Learning in Science and Their Implications for Science Pedagogy: A Literature Review. International Journal of Environmental & Science Education, 3(4), 193‚Äì206. Seymour Papert defined constructionism in a proposal to the National Science Foundation titled Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education as follows: > The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory of > science education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of > psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a > transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials > to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the > learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product. Some scholars have tried to describe constructionism as a \\"learning-by-making\\" formula but, as Seymour Papert and Idit Harel say at the start of Situating Constructionism, it should be considered \\"much richer and more multifaceted, and very much deeper in its implications than could be conveyed by any such formula.\\" Papert's ideas became well known through the publication of his seminal book Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (Basic Books, 1980). Papert described children creating programs in the Logo educational programming language. He likened their learning to living in a \\"mathland\\" where learning mathematical ideas is as natural as learning French while living in France. Instructional principles Constructionist learning involves students drawing their own conclusions through creative experimentation and the making of social objects. The constructionist teacher takes on a mediational role rather than adopting an instructional role. Teaching \\"at\\" students is replaced by assisting them to understand‚Äîand help one another to understand‚Äîproblems in a hands-on way. The teacher's role is not to be a lecturer but a facilitator who coaches students to attaining their own goals. =Problem-based learning= Problem-based learning is a constructionist method which allows students to learn about a subject by exposing them to multiple problems and asking them to construct their understanding of the subject through these problems. This kind of learning can be very effective in mathematics classes because students try to solve the problems in many different ways, stimulating their minds.Hmelo-Silver, C. E. & Barrows, H. S. (2006). Goals and strategies of a problem-based learning facilitator. Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning, 1. 21‚Äì39. The following five strategies make problem-based learning more effective: # The learning activities should be related to a larger task. The larger task is important because it allows students to see that the activities can be applied to many aspects of life and, as a result, students are more likely to find the activities they are doing useful.Wilson, B. (Ed.) Constructivist learning environments: Case studies in instrumental design. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Educational Technology Publications. # The learner needs to be supported to feel that they are beginning to have ownership of the overall problem. # An authentic task should be designed for the learner. This means that the task and the learner's cognitive ability have to match the problems to make learning valuable. # Reflection on the content being learned should occur so that learners can think through the process of what they have learned. # Allow and encourage the learners to test ideas against different views in different contexts. =Constructionism in social sciences= Not only can constructionism be applied to mathematics but to the social sciences as well. For example, instead of having students memorize geography facts, a teacher could give students blank maps that show unlabeled rivers, lakes, and mountains, and then ask the students to decipher where major cities might be located without the help of books or maps. This would require students to locate these areas without using prepared resources, but their prior knowledge and reasoning ability instead.Biehler, R., Snowman, J., D‚ÄôAmico, M., Schmid, R. (1999). The nature of meaningful learning. Psychology applied to teaching, 387‚Äì403. Digital storytelling is another application of constructionism to the social sciences. Students can visit institutions in the local community, to understand and document their histories, develop local maps using tools like OpenStreetMap to enrich digital maps and debate the purpose and activities of local public institutions to build an understanding of political science (civics). Digital storytelling has been used by government schools in Bengaluru to develop students understanding in the social sciences. Constructionism and technology Papert has been a huge proponent of bringing technology to classrooms, beginning with his early uses of the Logo language to teach mathematics to children. While constructionism has, due to its impetus, been primarily used in science and mathematics teaching (in the form of inquiry-based science), it is arguable that it developed in a different form in the field of media studies in which students often engage with media theory and practice simultaneously in a complementary praxis. More recently it has gained a foothold in applied linguistics in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). One such application has been the use of the popular game SimCity as a means of teaching English using constructionist techniques.Gromik, N. (2004). Sim City and English Teaching. Beginning in the 1980s, The LEGO Group funded research of Papert's research group at the MIT Media Laboratory, which at the time was known as the \\"Epistemology and Learning Group.\\" When LEGO launched its LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System in 1998, which was based on the work of his group, it received permission to use the moniker \\"Mindstorms\\" from Seymour's 1980 book title. In The LEGO Group's LEGO Serious Play project, business people learn to express corporate issues and identity through the medium of plastic bricks. In 2005, Papert, together with Nicholas Negroponte and Alan Kay, launched the One Laptop Per Child initiative to put constructionist learning into practice in the developing world. The aim is to provide $100 laptops to every child in the developing world. Computer programming languages A number of programming languages have been created, wholly or in part, for educational use, to support the constructionist approach to learning. These languages are dynamically typed, and are reflective. They include: * Logo is a multi- paradigm language, which is an easier-to-read adaptation and dialect of Lisp, without the parentheses. Logo is known for its introduction of turtle graphics to elementary schoolchildren in the 1980s. Its creators were Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Papert. * Smalltalk is an object-oriented language that was designed and created at Xerox PARC by a team led by Alan Kay. * Etoys is being developed since the 1990s under the direction of Alan Kay, most recently by the Viewpoints Research Institute, based on Morphic tile scripting. Etoys was initially targeted at primary school math and science education. * Physical Etoys is an extension of Etoys that allows to control different devices such as Lego NXT, Arduino Board, Sphero, Kinect, Duinobot, Wiimote among others. * Scratch was developed in the early 21st century at MIT Media Lab Lifelong Kindergarten Group led by Papert's pupil Mitchel Resnick. Like Etoys, it is based on Morphic tile scripts. Scratch was initially designed specifically to enhance the development of technological fluency at after- school centers in economically disadvantaged communities.NSF's grant A Networked, Media-Rich Programming Environment to Enhance Informal Learning and Technological Fluency at Community Technology Centers, National Science Foundation, Sep 2003. *StarLogo TNG was developed by the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program under Eric Klopfer. It combines a block programming interface with 3D graphics. It is targeted at programming games and game-like simulations in middle and secondary schools. *NetLogo was developed by Uri Wilensky. It was developed to teach children computational reasoning and thinking, and extends the Logo language by enabling the existence of many, many turtles at the same time. NetLogo is widely used not only in the K‚Äì12 environment, but also by researchers interested in the concept of agent-based modeling *Easy Java Simulations or Ejs or EJS was developed by Open Source Physics under Francisco Esquembre. The user is working at a higher conceptual level, declaring and organizing the equations and other mathematical expressions that operate the simulation. It is targeted at programming physics simulations in secondary schools and universities. *LEGO WeDo is a graphical programming language for children of age 7 years and up, used with the LEGO WeDo power function hub. *LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 is a dataflow graphical programming language for children age 10+. *Robot Emil is a constructionist educational tool for children. It is targeted at primary schools and teaches programming step by step.

Extracurricular activities = Mascot = The Southside High School mascot was originally the Rebels, more specifically Johnny Reb who is a fictional personification of a Confederate soldier. The mascot generated controversy along with the school's fight song, Dixie, due to Confederacy's association with slavery. In 2000, Principal Wayne Haver banned the display of the Confederate flag at school and school events; many students had taken it to be the school flag due to Johnny Reb being a Confederate soldier. Talks of replacing Johnny Reb with a mustang had circulated since the 1980s but no change was made until the summer of 2015. On June 23, 2015, a Fort Smith School Board committee voted to ban the playing of Dixie beginning the 2015-16 school year and to replace the Rebels mascot before the 2016-17 school year.http://swtimes.com/news/fort-smith-educators-target-dixie-rebel-mascot On July 27, 2015, the Fort Smith School Board voted 7-0 to change the Rebel mascot and fight song.http://4029tv.com/news/school-board-to-vote-on-mascot- fight-song-change-on-monday/34371322 A committee headed by Principal Haver, including business leaders, alumni and students, helped to select a new mascot for the 2016-17 school year. Principal Haver stated that a new fight song would be implemented immediately for use at all school-related events for the 2015-16 school year. On July 30, 2015, Haver announced that a new fight song, Wabash Cannonball, was selected after he had personally listened to more than 500 potential fight songs.http://5newsonline.com/2015/07/30/southside-high- school-in-fort-smith-gets-a-new-fight-song/ Beginning in the 2016-2017 school year, the mascot was changed to the Mavericks. = Athletics = Football  The Southside football teams have won seven state championships at the state's highest classification (1983, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1998, 2002, 2006). Four of those titles came under longtime Southside head coach Barry Lunney Sr., who left the school after the 2004 season for conference rival Bentonville. Jeff Williams took over the program and led Southside to their last title in his second year in 2006. In 2008 and in 2009, Southside made a surprising run to the championship game, but fell short to Bentonville in 2008 and Springdale Har-Ber in 2009. Battle of Rogers Avenue Plaque In the early 1960s when Fort Smith High School was separated into two schools, what formed was one of the premier rivalries in Arkansas. Because the town is divided down the middle by Rogers Avenue and the fact that Southside sits on one side of Rogers and Northside on the other, the game has become known as the \\"Battle of Rogers Avenue\\". This game has become a huge event locally in the city of Fort Smith and the surrounding area (usually drawing around 10,000 people to the event), even elevating to the level of shutting down some local schools and businesses on the day of the game. Southside beat Northside, for the first time, in 1978 and repeated in 1979. Once 2006, including 2010's game at Southside 56-29. The game was filmed by NFL Network as part of their American Great Rivalries Program and aired on national television in January 2011. Fort Smith Southside has several sports rivalries, including: * Northside Grizzlies * Bentonville Tigers * Rogers MountiesSouthside Rebel * Har-Ber Wildcats * Fayetteville Bulldogs * Greenwood Bulldogs  Volleyball  Fort Smith Southside volleyball teams have won seven state championships (4A - 1997; 5A - 1999, 2003, 2004; 7A - 2006, 2009, 2013).  Bowling  The bowling teams of Southside High have been one of the state's most successful with state championships in 2008, 2009 (boys), and 2010 (girls).  Track and field  The Southside track teams won three consecutive 7A class state track championships (2009, 2010, 2011). The Lady Mavericks are one of the state's most successful with 10 state track championships (1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995). 2007 = Educational competitions = The school has routinely done well in education/knowledge based competitions, to include: * Quiz Bowl State Champions (3A - 1996; 7A - 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014) * National Science Bowl (NSB) ‚Äì Arkansas Regional (and State) Champions (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2014) * National Science Bowl ‚Äì National Event 2007 (tied-13th place) * Knowledge Master Open State Champions (01F, 02S, 02F, 03S, 06F, 07S, 07F, 09S, 09F, 10F, 11F, 12F)  Notable alumni  The following are notable people associated with Southside High School.

It was first published as a serial in Pilote magazine, issues 368‚Äì389, in 1966. Synopsis Asterix and Obelix are setting off for a wild boar hunt when they encounter Panacea, a former childhood resident of the village who has since moved to Condatum, and Obelix immediately falls in love with her. Some hours later, Panacea receives word that her fianc√© Tragicomix has been conscripted into the Roman army and shipped to North Africa; and Obelix, although heartbroken, promises to bring him back. Asterix and Obelix travel to Condatum, where they learn that Tragicomix has already left for Massilia, the Mediterranean port from which the soldiers depart, and themselves enlist in the army to follow him, alongside Hemispheric the Goth; Selectivemploymentax the Briton; Gastronomix the Belgian; Neveratalos the Greek; and Ptenisnet, an Egyptian tourist who spends the entire book believing himself to be in a holiday camp. After completing basic training (and repeatedly and comically driving their instructors to the verge of tears), the newly formed unit sets off as reinforcements to Caesar against Scipio, Afranius, and King Juba I of Numidia. Asterix and Obelix soon find out that Tragicomix has gone missing in action after a skirmish, and raid Scipio's camp to recover him. This results in the Battle of Thapsus, in which the confusion over the Gauls' unorthodox assault and the similarity of both armies' uniforms cause a default victory for Caesar after the frustrated Scipio sounds the retreat. The Gauls are cornered by Caesar after the battle is over; but released and sent home for their assistance in his victory. Asterix and Obelix thereafter celebrate at home, while Panacea and Tragicomix return to Condatum to marry. Film adaptations *Elements of the plot of this story were blended with Asterix the Gladiator for the animated movie Asterix Versus Caesar. *The Raft of the Medusa sequence (see below) was incorporated into the 2002 live action film Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra. Notes * This is the first time Asterix does not join the usual ending banquet (he is still visible in the final panel, albeit not at the banquet tables), an absence not repeated until Asterix and the Magic Carpet. * When the pirates are first sunk, the ship's wreckage is a parody of the 19th century painting The Raft of the Medusa. In the English version, the pirate captain even bemoans, \\"We've been framed, by Jericho\\", a pun on the artist G√©ricault. In the French original, he says, \\"Je suis m√©dus√©\\" (\\"I am dumbfounded\\", or, most literally, \\"I am Medused\\"). * The legionaries in Asterix's unit are comic stereotypes of various nationalities, which parodies the French Foreign Legion's recruitment of foreigners. * The hair of the Belgian legionary resembles that of the Belgian comic character Tintin. * In the later part of the story, the Egyptian makes comments in hieroglyphics about hairy body parts ‚Äî this is based on a child's game in France that involves repeating back a rhyme of whatever was last said in the form of \\"old hairy (body part)\\". * The plot is partly inspired by a 1939 Laurel and Hardy film, The Flying Deuces (Les Conscrits), in which the pair join the French Foreign Legion after Hardy falls in love with a woman who turns out to have a husband in the legion. Laurel and Hardy later appeared as legionaries in Obelix & Co.. *As a mnemonic to Tragicomix's name, the line \\"timeo Danaos et dona ferentes\\" (\\"I fear the Greeks, even those bearing gifts\\") is used as a standard reference in the story.

His younger brother Arthur Willmore (1814-1888) trained with him, and also became an engraver. Radclyffe had received drawing lessons in Birmingham from Joseph Barber. He married, and in 1823 he went to London where he worked for Charles Heath for three years. He later worked on the plates of William Brockedon's Passes of the Alps and Turner's England and Wales. He made engravings after Chalon, Leitch, Stanfield, Landseer, Eastlake, Creswick and Ansdell, and especially after Turner. Willmore engraved thirteen pictures on copper for Turner's England and Wales series, beginning in 1828, and eight on steel for his Rivers of France.

It was discovered on 15 October 1985, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The asteroid was named after Malcolm Kennedy of the Astronomical Society of Glasgow.  Orbit and classification  Kennedy is a member of the Nysa family (), the largest asteroid family of the main belt, consisting of stony and carbonaceous subfamilies. The family, named after 44 Nysa, is located in the inner belt near the Kirkwood gap (3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter), a depleted zone that separates the central main belt. It is, however, a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,384 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in June 1954, more than 31 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  Kennedy has been characterized as a common stony S-type asteroid by PanSTARRS photometric survey. = Rotation period = In December 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Kennedy was obtained from photometric observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 3.659 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.52 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Kennedy measures 5.129 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.267, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 4.42 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.08.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of Malcolm Kennedy (1944‚Äì1997), secretary of the Astronomical Society of Glasgow. He was born and raised in New Zealand and became a civil engineer in Scotland. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 August 1998 ().

She became Madame Mao after her marriage to Mao Zedong. In this story Min tries to cast a sympathetic light on one of the most controversial political figures in the People's Republic of China. Plot summary Madame Mao is born to a very poor family around 1910 (early enough to have had her feet bound although due to a severe infection the bindings were taken off). She has an abusive father who kicks her and her concubine mother out of the house at an early age. Her mother ends up as a concubine and servant and the young 'Madame Mao' runs away to her grandparents. Anchee Min, the author, seems to attribute a lot of Madame Mao's later actions to her childhood‚Äîand that a lot of her incessant claims to power actually come from a need to be desired and to feel close to Mao rather than a deep need for power herself. Madame Mao's dream is to become an actress but she only achieves mediocre success. Using the stage name Lan Ping, she spends a few years in Shandong province (where she becomes a Communist due to a lover of hers) and then Shanghai. In Shanghai she had some success in playing Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, and the author clearly parallels Nora's strength and inability to be controlled with Lan Ping's strong personality and need to be in control and the center of attention. The play is closed down since it is perceived to be too subversive by the authorities. She even ends up in prison for a short time but is released after signing a document denouncing Communism. After what seems like a string of rejections as well as a few serious lovers and two husbands, she travels to Yan'an, Mao's revolutionary base, to become part of his movement. The book does not offer much explanation for the switch from actress to countryside revolutionary except that she certainly had been involved in revolutionary elements (anti-Japanese plays, etc.) and that with the absence of work as an actress she did not have many options. Also, joining the Communist revolution seemed to be a common choice for young discontented students and others in their 20s. In Yan'an, she soon meets Mao as the leading actress in patriotic plays. They meet frequently and finally become lovers. Mao is still married to his second wife He Zizhen (his first died as a revolutionary), who is in Russia and mentally unstable, but by the time she returns to China, Mao and Lan Ping have married and she is put in a mental hospital. The Communist Party is very much against Mao's affair with Lan Ping, in large part because they have worked hard to build up the image of his second wife as a martyr for the cause and do not want Mao's image to be tarnished in any way as an adulterer. The Party is supposed to emphasize discipline and unity. The affair continues despite (or perhaps is enhanced because of) these odds and the disapproval of many Communists. Finally, Lan becomes pregnant and Mao is allowed to divorce He Zizhen and marry her, under the condition that she stay out of the public eye and is not involved in politics at all. Her name is changed to Jiang Qing. During the years before Communists gain full control of mainland China, the relationship seems to go well, although the passion is reduced. Jiang follows Mao everywhere, even to the field, and becomes his secretary when he is sick. However, things change once the Communists triumph. They move to the Forbidden City in Beijing and live in separate quarters. Mao begins to lead a totally separate life with much traveling and entertaining. As she is not allowed by the party to be in the public eye, she is not a part of all of this. She becomes very lonely and depressed. Mao has many affairs, especially bringing young virgins in from the countryside for his pleasure. Things last in this way for 17 years with the majority of Chinese people not even able to name the wife of the great Chairman. However, Jiang Qing has never lost her ambition to be powerful and loved and noticed. She sees a glimmer of opportunity at Mao's low point‚Äîtwo years after the launch of the Great Leap Forward which proved disastrous. She begins slowly to reemerge from the shadows and spends some time in Shanghai building up a network of actors and producers (her great passion is still opera and theater). Finally, she approaches Mao to reveal that a current popular play is actually subversive against the emperor. She feeds on his paranoia that those closest to him are actually plotting against him. He gives her some permission to carry on her activities and develop some propagandist plays that exalt him. Slowly she builds up her own friends and aides who can be trusted. Finally, in 1966 she is actually allowed to make an important speech and helps Mao develop the concepts behind the Cultural Revolution. Eventually, Mao puts her in charge of the 'ideology side of the business' and she wields an enormous amount of power. Madame Mao, as she is now called, organizes festivals for revolutionary plays and begins to work closely with the student movements which have always been so important in China. She organizes and speaks to rallies of thousands of people to help launch the Cultural Revolution. Finally, Mao and Jiang decide to launch a student-led army called the Red Guards that she would be in charge of. The Red Guards end up having more power than the official military for a number of years and wreak havoc throughout the country. Her relationship with Mao is no longer romantic in the least but is mutually beneficial: 'For him, it is the security of his empire that she aids and for her, the role of a heroine. In retrospect she not only has broken the Party's restriction, she runs the nation's psyche. She is gripped by the vision that she might eventually carry on Mao's business and rule China after his death. As Madame Mao's power grows, so does her worry about Mao and his constantly changing allegiances and worries about betrayals. He emphasizes that the public only trusts her because he is backing her. His dementia and paranoia grows as he ages. At one point Mao invites a bunch of the 'old boy's over for a meeting without inviting her. She says: ' I should have known that my husband was doing the two-faced trick. I should have understood that although Mao had been promoting me, my new power unnerves him and he needs to have another force to balance the game.' In Mao's final months, Madame Mao is desperate for him to name her as his successor or at the very least to give a definitive statement that she represents him. She desperately wants his power after his death but if that's not possible at the very least she needs protection from all the party members who are ready to attack her. She sends investigators to extract forced confessions from her enemies and becomes increasingly paranoid and power-obsessed herself. She forms a power circle called the Gang of Four with herself as the leader, Zhang Chunqiao (whom she found in Shanghai and gave much power to), Wang Hongwen (whom she found as a student and Mao promoted to Vice Chairman of the Communist party) and another disciple, Yao Wenyuan. In September 1976, Mao dies at the age of 83. When Mao's will is eventually found, he has named Hua Guofeng, a provincial governor from his home province, as his successor. Madame Mao had quickly sensed that her enemies would triumph‚Äîat Mao's funeral she was barely acknowledged. A few weeks after Mao's death she is arrested. Madame Mao remains in prison from 1976 to 1991. Her daughter, Li Na, picks up what Madame Mao disliked and dropped what her mother liked or wanted her to do. Madame Mao has \\"saved enough handkerchiefs and socks to make a rope.\\" She commits suicide by hanging herself on May 14, 1991. She was on Death Row the whole time, although she was not executed since her captors would have preferred to extract a confession of repentance from her.

Customers were able to sign up for a \\"CUE\\" card (\\"Customer Updates and 'Eggs'tras\\") that would provide discounts. By June 1987, when Alhadeff was 40 years old, the company had 50 stores on the West Coast of the United States. In June 1988, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. Within a year, the stock price dropped from $17 per share to $11 per share and top executives, including the founder, were sued for fraud for failing to disclose material facts about the true condition of the company\`s inventory systems and finances. By December 1989, the company had 206 stores, but closed 20 of them due to losses and inventory issues and theft. In June 1993, the company released its first software product, Egghead Express, which allowed customers to place and manage orders. In 1995, the company moved its headquarters from Issaquah, Washington, east of Seattle, to Spokane. At that time it had 2,500 employees and operated retail stores in 30 states. Also in 1995, when the development manager of Windows 95 wanted to test compatibility, he bought a copy of every program for sale at an Egghead store. In 1996, George Orban became chairman and in January 1997, he became CEO. In May 1996, Egghead sold its Corporate, Government & Education division to Software Spectrum for $45 million. At that time, the stock price was $6 per share and there was speculation of a takeover of the company. In February 1997, the company announced it would close 77 of its 156 stores and reported additional losses. In May 1997, the company acquired competitor Surplus Software Inc. for $31.5 million. In January 1998, the company reported a loss and announced it will close all 80 of its remaining stores, layoff 600 of its 800 employees, and sell only through its website, Egghead.com. Its stock price fell 18% on the news. In July 1998, during the dot-com bubble, shares soared to $25 as investors bought up shares of internet companies. In 1999, the company merged with OnSale.com in a $375 million all-stock transaction. The company kept the Egghead.com name and the CEO of Onsale, Jerry Kaplan, became CEO of the combined company. In December 2000, right before Christmas, the company's servers were compromised, and it feared that the credit card data of over 3.7 million people was stolen. The company first publicly denied that there was a problem, then notified Visa Inc., which notified banks, who notified consumers, causing the breach to escalate into a full blown scandal. Many credit cards were cancelled. The company later discovered that credit card information was not obtained. In August 2001, the company filed bankruptcy and worked out a deal to be acquired by Fry's Electronics. However, the deal fell apart after Fry's accused Egghead of failing to provide financial documents, and in December 2001, the company sold its domain name to Amazon.com.

In figuring inheritance of the decedent's estate, the slayer is treated as though they had died before the person they murdered, hence the murderer's share of the estate would pass to their issue. While a criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the slayer rule applies to civil law, not criminal law, so the prosecutor must only prove the murder by a preponderance of the evidence, as in a wrongful death claim. Hence, even a slayer who is acquitted of the crime of murder can lose the inheritance by the civil court running the estate. Statutory response to slayers At common law, American courts used two different theories when dealing with early slayer cases. Some courts would disinherit the slayer because of the public policy principle that a slayer should not profit from his crime (No Profit theory). =No Profit theory= In Mutual Life v. Armstrong, the first American case to consider the issue of whether a slayer could profit from his crime, the US Supreme Court set forth the No Profit (the term \\"No Profit\\" theory is a term coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that applied a similar outcome when dealing with slayers). public policy justification of slayer statutes saying: \\"It would be a reproach to the jurisprudence of the country if one could recover insurance money payable on the death of the party whose life he had feloniously taken.\\"Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 117U.S. 591, 600 (1886). Other courts were reluctant to disinherit a slayer in absence of a legislatively codified statute directing the court to do so (Strict Construction theory). =Strict Construction theory= The Strict Construction theory (the term \\"Strict Construction\\" theory is a term coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that dealt applied a similar outcome when disinheriting slayers). originated from Judge John Clinton Gray's dissent in Riggs v. Palmer.Riggs v. Palmer, 22 N.E. 188, 191-93(1889) Judge Gray argued that the criminal law already established punishment for slayers. A court denying the estate to a slayer was to, in effect, add significant further punishment to what a slayer received under the criminal statute. Judge Gray argued that this was not something the court was permitted to do without an express, written statute. In Judge Gray's opinion, the court could not simply create or imagine such statutes so as to obtain a morally pleasing result. Slayer statutes codify the public policy principle that a murderer cannot profit from his crime. Slayer statutes provide a right of civil action to a victim's successors for the purpose of directing the victim's testate/intestate property away from the slayer. Such an action is brought by a successor, or other party of interest (e.g., life insurance company, bank), on behalf of the victim's estate. The slayer statute applies to both real and personal property that would have been acquired by intestacy or by will.The Law of Trusts and Trustees ¬ß 478. In 1936, legal scholar John W. Wade proposed a No Profit theory statutory fix to promote uniformity amongst the states in dealing with slayer cases.John W. Wade, Acquisition of Property by Wilfully Killing Another - A Statutory Solution, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1936). In 1969, the Uniform Law Commission included No Profit theory language in its first promulgation of the Uniform Probate Code (UPC).‚ÄúAn individual who feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this [article] with respect to the decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed his [or her] intestate share.‚Äù ¬ß 2-803. Effect of Homicide on Intestate Succession, Wills, Trusts, Joint Assets, Life Insurance, and Beneficiary Designations., Unif. Probate Code ¬ß 2-803. Forty-eight states have enacted laws that strip a slayer of any inheritance benefit he would have gained from his unlawful act.See Anne-Marie Rhodes, Consequences of Heirs‚Äô Misconduct: Moving from Rules to Discretion, 33 Ohio N.U. L. Rev. 975, 980 (2007). Regional details=United States= In the United States, most jurisdictions have enacted a slayer statute, which codifies the rule and supplies additional conditions. Such laws have sometimes been construed narrowly because the relevant statutes are criminal in nature, and serve to take away someone's rights that are otherwise afforded by law. Interpreted this way, a slayer statute will not prevent the killer from acquiring title to the property by other means. In jurisdictions with a common law slayer rule, a slayer statute may serve to extend and supplement the common law rule, rather than limiting it. For example, where the statute requires the heir to have been convicted to bar inheritance, a common law slayer rule that does not have this requirement may still serve to bar inheritance.23 Am. Jur. 2d Descent and Distribution ¬ß 50. Arizona In 2012, the Arizona legislature amended Arizona's slayer rule to include the lesser crime of manslaughter in an effort to subject more killers to civil disinheritance. Prior to the 2012 amendment, only killers found guilty of murder in the first or second degree would be disinherited under Arizona's slayer rule. Several specific cases (e.g., Grace Pianka; Douglas Grant; and Gilbert Ramos) prompted the Arizona legislature to amend Arizona's slayer rule by 1) expressly defining ‚Äúintentional and felonious‚Äù to mean any individual who is found guilty of murder in the first or second degree, or the lesser crime of manslaughter; 2) allowing victims to place the decedent's estate in constructive trust immediately from the time of the killing; and 3) allowing the victims to place the slayer's estate (i.e., life insurance benefits) in constructive trust, in the case of murder-suicide. Arizona now touts its slayer rule as the strongest in the nation. Maryland The Maryland slayer rule is harsher than most other states. In addition to prohibiting murderers from inheriting from their victims, Maryland's slayer rule prohibits anyone else from inheriting from murder victims through their murderers; Maryland's slayer rule is thus similar in structure to corruption of blood.Cook v. Grierson, 380 Md. 502 (2004). For example, a mother leaves her son $50,000, and leaves her son's child (her grandchild) $100,000. She leaves her residuary estate (i.e., whatever else is left of the estate) to her daughter. If the son kills his mother, then under Maryland law, the son's child will inherit the $100,000; however the son's $50,000 (which is also the indirect inheritance of the grandchild through his father), is not available under Maryland law to either the son, or his child. The $50,000 becomes part of the mother's residuary estate and goes to the daughter. Texas Texas law states \\"No conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.\\" However, if a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or contract is convicted and sentenced (including accomplices) in wilfully bringing about the death of the insured, proceeds are then paid in accordance with the Texas Insurance Code.Estates Code ¬ß201.058 =United Kingdom= A similar principle in the United Kingdom is governed by the Forfeiture Act 1982.

Doreen appeared in 17 episodes before returning as a permanent character in 2002 and 2003. She came back the following year for three episodes, proving to be Gee's final television role. Early life and education The daughter of a business man living in Rutland, Gee was privately educated at Benenden School, where she was in the year below Princess Anne.Des Wilson, ‚ÄúSix girls heading for stardom‚Äù in The Observer magazine, 1974 volume, p. 524 Wanting to become an actress, she studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, where she won the Spotlight Award for Best Actress in 1972; she then spent six months in repertory playing Priestley, Shaw, Shakespeare, Feydeau and Orton. Television and film work Her first television role was as Anna Fitzgerald in Granada Television's 1930s drama serial Shabby Tiger (1973), in which she rose to overnight notoriety by becoming the first model to show full frontal nudity on British television. She was quickly hailed as Britain's answer to Brigitte Bardot or Sophia Loren. In a 2002 interview, Gee recalled: \\"I was working in serious theatre, but got a reputation of being a sex symbol. I was too young to know any better so I tended to go with the flow.\\" Gee made her film debut in 1975, alongside Sidney Poitier, Michael Caine, and Nicol Williamson, in The Wilby Conspiracy, for which she was nominated Best Newcomer in the Evening News Film Awards. The same year she starred as journalist Sandy Williams in Cover Story, episode 8 of the police drama series The Sweeney. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Gee had guest roles in many television shows, including Return of the Saint, The Glittering Prizes, Hammer House of Horror, The Professionals, and Alas Smith & Jones. She also made regular appearances on the game shows Call My Bluff and Give Us A Clue. In 1976, Gee starred as Sheila in Waris Hussein's production of Waiting For Sheila for the ITV Sunday Night Drama slot. She appeared as Del Henney's girlfriend Rebecca Westgate in the second series of the ITV drama serial Fallen Hero in 1979. In 1981, she starred as Miss Griffin in Nigel Kneale's short-lived LWT sci-fi comedy series Kinvig, alongside Tony Haygarth. In 1983, she appeared opposite Sean Connery as nurse Patrica Fearing in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. Other movies throughout the decade included 1985's Number One, where she played a news reporter interviewing Bob Geldof's lead character, and in 1988 she played Sting's wife in Stormy Monday. In 1985, she appeared as Penelope Keith's disruptive actress sister in the ITV sitcom Moving, and the following year co-starred with Pat Phoenix in Constant Hot Water. In 1989, she made a guest appearance in the Going Away episode of the ITV comedy series After Henry, and another in the short-lived comedy series, Split Ends, starring Anita Dobson, in a part specially created for her in the episode titled The Brush Off. In 1998, she played Catherine McKay, a fading adult film star in the romantic comedy film Merchants of Venus, filmed in Los Angeles, in which she starred with Michael York, Beverly D'Angelo and Brian Cox. Although well-received by the critics, Merchants of Venus wasn't made commercially available until 2002, when it was released on DVD. Gee's last television role was Doreen Heavey in Coronation Street, the mother of Maxine Peacock and a part she played in regular intervals from 1999 to 2004. The character of Doreen was scatty and flirty, and during her time on the show, had a brief flirtation with Mike Baldwin, a feud with Vera Duckworth, and was a constant source of irritation for her son-in-law Ashley Peacock, when she arrived at his and Maxine's house following a split with her husband Derrick, whom she was reconciled with in 2003. Theatre work Gee has had a long and varied career on the stage. David Storey cast her in his production of The Farm in 1973, her future husband Ken Campbell gave her the role of the Goddess of Chaos in his acclaimed play Illuminatus in 1976, and in 1988, she played all three women in Last of the Red Hot Lovers. From 1989 to 1990, she starred as the blind Suzy in a national tour of Wait Until Dark. She took on the double role of Alice in Double Take, at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1990. The same year she devised and starred in Warhola with Snoo Wilson as Warhol (taken from The Philosophy of Andy Warhol) at Offstage and the Carib Theatre, Trinidad. From 1991 to 1992, she acted in the play Time and Time Again, which included dates at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Shortly after, she played Romaine in the Agatha Christie play Witness for the Prosecution. In 1994, she appeared as Kate in William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, a production which was directed by Val May. Gee gave up acting in 2004. She briefly returned in 2011 when she appeared in the short film Trimming Pablo. Private life and later career Gee was once in a relationship with Michael Winner. She married the actor and director Ken Campbell in 1978, with whom she had a daughter, Daisy; the couple divorced after five years but remained on good terms. Since 2006, she has worked as a counsellor and therapist in Camden, London. In April 2013, in her capacity as a counsellor, Gee was interviewed on Jo Good's BBC London 94.9 radio show, talking about addiction. On the programme, Gee revealed that she had given up acting because she had started her training as a counsellor whilst she was by then playing \\"mums and grannies\\", and there weren't as many parts for her. She had tried to do the two together but realised that she could not give her full attention to both. Gee said that she \\"bravely\\" said to her agent: \\"that's it\\", and that she wanted to be taken out of Spotlight. She added: \\"It was the most liberating thing I've ever done\\".

He helped engineer the downfall of Robert Walpole in 1742 and engaged in negotiations with the exiled Stuarts prior to the 1745 Jacobite Rising but did not participate himself. He died in a hunting accident in 1749. Life Williams- Wynn was the eldest son of Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Llanforda near Oswestry in Shropshire and Jane Thelwall. His grandfather, also Sir William Williams was Solicitor General under James II and led the prosecution of the Seven Bishops in 1688. His mother was a descendant of the antiquary Sir John Wynn, Wynnstay, c. 1793, destroyed by fire in 1858 In 1719, a later Sir John Wynn died, and through his mother's kinship Watkin inherited the Wynnstay estates on condition he add \\"Wynn\\" to his name, followed by his father's title and lands on his death in 1740. Through his first wife, Ann Vaughan (c. 1695‚Äì1748), Williams-Wynn acquired extensive estates in Montgomeryshire and Denbighshire and over time became the pre-eminent landowner in North Wales. When Anne died in March 1748, he married another heiress, his god-daughter Frances Shackerley (1721‚Äì1803); his son and heir, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet (1749‚Äì1789) was born a few months before Sir Watkin's death in a hunting accident in September 1749. Political career After graduating from Jesus College, Oxford, Williams-Wynn became Member of Parliament or MP for Denbighshire in 1716. His first recorded speech in Parliament did not occur until 1727 but he was an active member of the Tory Jacobite faction. As a leader of the Cycle of the White Rose, a Welsh Jacobite society, he \\"burnt the King's picture\\" during the 1722 General Election and opposed a \\"loyal address\\" to George I following the Atterbury Plot. He also served as Mayor of Oswestry in 1728/1729 and of Chester in 1736/1737. His money and connections made Williams-Wynn a formidable local political power; in 1722, nine out of eleven Parliamentary seats in North Wales returned Tory candidates. While fiercely contested, the election confirmed the dominance of Robert Walpole and the Whig party; their exclusion from government resulted in the continuing expression of Jacobite sympathies among the more extreme Tories. Williams-Wynn employed Welsh colliers to threaten Whig supporters in the 1733 Chester mayoral election but overtly Jacobite displays were rare and often rooted in Tory opposition to Welsh religious Nonconformists. Sir Watkin William-Wynn c. 1740 The complexity of Jacobite support was demonstrated in 1736 when Williams-Wynn and other Tory Jacobites voted against repealing the Test Act and removing legal restrictions on those who were not members of the Church of England, such as Nonconformists and Catholics like the exiled Stuarts. Opposition to religious minorities in general was fuelled by memories of the divisions that led to the 1639‚Äì1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms; it was particularly strong in Wales due to the early 18th century Welsh Methodist revival.Monod, Paul p. 197 Sir John Hynde Cotton (1686‚Äì1752), Williams-Wynn's Tory colleague in ousting Walpole in 1742 When the Tory leader Sir William Wyndham died in 1740, Williams-Wynn led the campaign against Walpole, in partnership with Sir John Hynde Cotton, allegedly one of \\"the most zealous Jacobites in England.\\" In contrast to Williams-Wynn, Cotton was a gifted orator who helped organised the Parliamentary campaign against Walpole. In the 1741 General Election, Walpole targeted Williams-Wynn's Denbighshire seat; although he won the popular vote by 1352 votes to 933, 594 of these were disallowed, returning his rival. He sat instead for Montgomeryshire and after Walpole's resignation in 1742, regained his seat of Denbighshire on appeal. However, the chief beneficiaries of Walpole's fall were the so-called Patriot Whigs and a Tory faction led by Lord Gower who became Lord Privy Seal in 1742. This led Jacobites like Williams-Wynn and the 4th Duke of Beaufort to re-open negotiations with Stuart agents. In early 1744, Cotton accepted a government position in Henry Pelham's so-called Broad Bottom Ministry and Williams-Wynn voted with the government for the first time in his career. Although Britain and France were then engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession, in October 1744 he secretly travelled to Versailles where Louis XV assured him of French support for a Jacobite rising.Forbes, John Robert Walpole, Whig Prime Minister 1721‚Äì1742 In common with many other Jacobites, Williams-Wynn's support was conditional on a substantial French military landing in England. When Charles Stuart invaded England during the 1745 Rising, Williams-Wynn remained in London to attend Parliament, only sending an oral message promising help when a French army arrived, an offer that arrived too late to help Charles. After the Rebellion ended, the testimony of Prince Charles' former secretary Murray of Broughton led to the execution of Lord Lovat; he also implicated a number of Tories, including Williams-Wynn and Cotton but the government decided against further prosecutions.Thomas, Peter Lord Gower (1694‚Äì1754); in 1742, he became the first Tory to hold senior office under the Hanoverians The Tories were now split into a \\"Jacobite\\" faction led by Williams-Wynn and those who followed Lord Gower; in an effort to stir up support and differentiate themselves, Williams-Wynn and others participated in Jacobite demonstrations at the 1747 Lichfield Races. Despite these efforts, the 1747 General Election reduced the Jacobite Tories to a largely irrelevant rump.Monod, Paul Kleber p. 199 Despite his failure to participate in the 1745 Rising, Williams-Wynn wrote to Prince Charles in December 1747, assuring him that his supporters wished \\"for nothing more than another happy opportunity wherein they may exert themselves more in deeds than in words, in the support of your Royal Highness's dignity and interest and the cause of liberty.\\"Forbes, John The tendency to say one thing and do another was not uncommon; for example, Cotton urged Louis XV to invade in August 1745, despite being a government minister at the time. The demonstration at Lichfield was one of the last significant displays of Jacobite sentiment, although his son the 4th Baronet re-established the White Rose Cycle in 1770, where it served as a club for a range of independent opinions.Monod, Paul Kleber p. 296 Legacy Monument to Sir Watkin Williams- Wynn at Ruabon, by Michael Rysbrack. He was buried at Ruabon in the parish church of St Mary's. His widow, Dame Frances, commissioned a monument from the sculptor Michael Rysbrack completed in 1755; it was too large for the existing chancel and a new south-east chapel was built to house it. He commissioned the building of a new mansion at Wynnstay to replace the original by William Eyton in 1616, later destroyed by fire in 1858. At his death, his estates stretched over five Welsh counties and into the English county of Shropshire, reputedly producing an estimated rental income of ¬£20,000. This was a very substantial sum at the time but it was also rumoured that his political activities left his heir with debts of over ¬£120,000.Thomas, Peter Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn left a number of items to Jesus College, including a massive silver-gilt punch bowl weighing more than and holding . This was used at a dinner in 1814, celebrating the defeat of Napoleon; attendees included the Tsar of Russia, Frederick of Prussia, General Bl√ºcher, Metternich, the Prince Regent, the Duke of York and the Duke of Wellington. A portrait of Williams-Wynn by Thomas Hudson was acquired by Jesus College in 1997; it is not on public display as it hangs in the Senior Common Room of the college. It shows him wearing a sky- blue coat, a symbol used by Tory Jacobite sympathisers.De'Ath, John, \\"Portrait of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn\\", The Jesus College Record (1997/8), 39‚Äì40.

Models of idealised populations are either used to make a general point, or they are fit to data on real populations for which the assumptions may not hold true. For example, coalescent theory is used to fit data to models of idealised populations.. Nielsen, Rasmus, and Montgomery Slatkin. An Introduction to Population Genetics: Theory and Applications. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, 2013. Print. The most common idealized population in population genetics is described in the Wright-Fisher model after Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher (1922, 1930) and (1931). Wright-Fisher populations have constant size, and their members can mate and reproduce with any other member. Another example is a Moran model, which has overlapping generations, rather than the non- overlapping generations of the Fisher-Wright model. The complexities of real populations can cause their behavior to match an idealised population with an effective population size that is very different from the census population size of the real population. For sexual diploids, idealized populations will have genotype frequencies related to the allele frequencies according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hardy-Weinberg In 1908, G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg modeled an idealised population to demonstrate that in the absence of selection, migration, random genetic drift, allele frequencies stay constant over time, and that in the presence of random mating, genotype frequencies are related to allele frequencies according to a binomial square principle called the Hardy-Weinberg law..Crow, James F. \\"Population genetics history: a personal view.\\" Annual Review of Genetics 21, no. 1 (1987): 1-22. Usage in population dynamics A good example of usage idealised population model, in tracking natural population conditions, could be found in a research of Joe Roman and Stephen R. Palumbi (2003). Using genetic diversity data, they questioned: have populations of North Atlantic great whales recovered enough for commercial whaling? To calculate genetic diversity the authors multiply long term effective population size of the females by two, assuming sex ratio 1:1, and then multiply by mitochondrial genes substitution rate, per generation. Making several assumptions according to the sex ratio and number of juveniles, they were able to calculate that in contrast to historical records, modern whale populations are far from harvestable range. Application to population history Idealised population models could not only provide us with information about present populations conditions but are useful in revealing natural history and population dynamics in the past as well. Using an idealised population model, Anders Eriksson and Andrea Manica (2012) tested the hypothesis of the archaic human admixture with modern humans. The authors compare genome sequences of two human populations, Neanderthals and chimpanzee. Eriksson and Manica created a stepping stone model under which Africa and Eurasia are represented as a string of equal size populations. They concluded that under the stepping stone model, in which Europeans can exchange genetic information with Asians and not with Africans, similarities between Neanderthal genome and Eurasian could be explained by ancient populations structure.Eriksson, Anders, and Andrea Manica. \\"Effect of ancient population structure on the degree of polymorphism shared between modern human populations and ancient hominins.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 35 (2012): 13956-13960. Computer simulations Usage of models, also allows to perform simulations, including in silica ones, to hypothesize evolutionary outcomes.

PI binds to DNA by intercalating between the bases with little or no sequence preference. When in an aqueous solution, PI has a fluorescent excitation maximum of 493 nm (blue-green), and an emission maximum of 636 nm (red). After binding DNA, the quantum yield of PI is enhanced 20-30 fold, and the excitation/emission maximum of PI is shifted to 535 nm (green) / 617 nm (orange-red). Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualize the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide is not membrane-permeable, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells based on membrane integrity. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining. PI is widely used in fluorescence staining and visualization of the plant cell wall.

The bridge first opened to traffic in 1940, replacing ferry service as the primary connection for the town of Jamestown, situated on Conanicut Island. It was constructed for just over $3 million 1940 USD, which was paid for by tolls until June 28, 1969. With a total length of 6,892 feet (2,100 m), the Jamestown Bridge was the third longest in Rhode Island at the time of its destruction, ranking behind its replacement, the adjacent 7,350-foot (2,240 m) Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge, and the 11,248-foot (3,428 m) Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge connecting Conanicut Island to Aquidneck Island and Newport. The Jamestown Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic on October 8, 1992, and its main span was destroyed through a controlled demolition on April 18, 2006.  History  Navigating around Narragansett Bay had proved troublesome since the colonial era, the first ferry operation began in 1675 introduced an alternate to the long route around Providence, Rhode Island. Steam service in the West Passage began in 1888 and reduced travel times, but subject to weather conditions. In 1920, the first plans for the Jamestown Bridge began and it was stimulated by the Newport Ferry Company's financial troubles. In 1934, during the Great Depression, the State of Rhode Island sought funding from the United States federal government to construct bridges over both the West Passage and East Passage of the bay. The plans were well-supported and passed the Rhode Island House of Representatives by a 96-to-1 vote, and were approved by President Franklin Roosevelt. The minor opposition to the bridge's construction was quelled after the 1938 New England hurricane destroyed the ferry docks and one of the ferryboats on September 21, 1938, stopping ferry service. The bridge was designed by Parsons, Klapp, Brinckerhoff and Douglass and called for a bridge with 69 spans with a total cost of $3 million. The bridge was delayed by two months, but was completed for better than $100,000 under budget. A crew of nearly 200 constructed the bridge and the work was completed without a single fatality. This claim however is contested as a fatality took place during the construction of the coffer dams on September 18, 1939. On July 27, 1940, the bridge opened for traffic and a 90 cent toll was charged on the Kingstown side. The toll would later be reduced to 35 cents and 25 cents before being removed in 1969, following the completion of the Newport (Pell) Bridge. A formal dedication of the bridge commenced on the weekend of August 2 through August 4, 1940, with a military marine parade on the final day. Structure The bridge consisted of 69 spans with a large continuous cantilever Warren truss centerpiece. The 600 ft (183 m) main span was 135 ft (41 m) above the western portion of the Narragansett Bay. The bridge was long thought to be a danger to motorists, consisting of only two undivided lanes, and during the summer months, the eastbound lane was usually at a standstill due to vacationers traveling to Newport via the main route from the mainland. Its steep climb proved challenging for some vehicles and with no passing lanes or shoulders, hazardous conditions resulted when stalled vehicles were on the bridge. The roadway deck through the cantilevered span was an open steel-grid deck, similar to that of the Castleton Bridge just south of Albany, New York, or the now-demolished Sikorsky Bridge on the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. The deck proved to be extremely slippery when wet. After the bridge began to show structural problems with age, RIDOT began construction of the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge in 1985. The new bridge, which opened on October 8, 1992, includes four divided lanes of traffic with shoulders.  Service  The bridge is reported to have inspired fear in motorists because of its open grates, which allowed the motorists to peer down into the Narragansett Bay about below, and because the bridge would shake in high winds. Head-on collisions on the undivided bridge were reported to be common, and the steel grid pavement was noted as \\"treacherous\\" when wet. Demolition The Jamestown Bridge was destroyed in a controlled demolition in April 2006. Approximate location The United States Coast Guard had long declared the Jamestown Bridge to be a navigation hazard and requested that the state of Rhode Island dismantle the eastern two thirds of it. The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, suggested to instead turn the bridge into a bike route and walkway. However, the aging structure proved to be in far worse condition than previously thought, prompting officials to go ahead with removing the entire structure. On April 18, 2006, the main span of the Jamestown Bridge was brought down by 75 pounds of RDX explosives and 350 shaped charges. TNT charges were later used to remove the concrete piers. On May 18, 2006, crews imploded the trusses that once carried the side spans. Throughout mid-2006, workers removed the remaining support piers and low-level approach spans west of the main channel. The extreme western portion of the bridge was not demolished with the remains of the bridge during 2006, as officials planned to renovate and convert it into a fishing pier, but ultimately it was removed in 2010 when renovation and cleanup proved too costly. That last part was then demolished in the same year. The total cost for removal of the Jamestown Bridge was US$22 million. The demolished steel superstructure was floated away for recycling, while concrete from the bridge piers was used to create artificial reefs below the mouth of Narragansett Bay.

Early life and education He was second son of abolitionist William Wilberforce, and active in the Oxford Movement. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, taking a double first in 1823. Career In 1826, he was chosen fellow of Oriel and was ordained, among his friends and colleagues being Newman, Pusey and Keble. Though Robert is perhaps lesser known, all were prominent figures within the Oxford Movement and involved in the publication of the Tracts for the Times. For a few years he was one of the tutors at Oriel. The provost Edward Hawkins disliked his religious views, and in 1831 Wilberforce resigned and left Oxford. His release from Oxford gave him the opportunity to study in German areas; his familiarity with German theology and competency as a German scholar being one of the things for which he was most revered among his contemporaries. In 1832 he obtained the living of East Farleigh, Kent, which in 1840 he exchanged for that of Burton Agnes, near Hull. In 1841, he was appointed archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire. About this time Wilberforce became close with Henry Manning, and they exchanged many letters on theological and ecclesiastical questions. They were deeply involved in re-examining the relationship between the Church of England and Roman Catholicism. On 27 March 1848, Robert Wilberforce and his brother Samuel joined the Canterbury Association. It was during his time in Burton Agnes, and his correspondence with Manning, that Robert‚Äôs real struggle with his religion began. The slow pace of life ensured much of his time was spent mulling over the same arguments over and over again. His growing disillusionment was centered on what he perceived to be an untidy boundary between the State and the Church which caused his allegiance to the Church of England to gradually wane until it disappeared altogether. In 1851, Manning joined the Roman Catholic Church, and three years later Wilberforce took the same step. His conversion came as a reaction to the so-called Gorham Judgement. The effects of which seemed to affirm Robert‚Äôs doubts and consequently his conviction that the Church of England was a heretical body to which he could no longer belong with a clear conscience, turning his loyalty away from Canterbury and York, towards Rome for good. It is also thought that the controversy excited following the publication of his Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist - the third in a series of such doctrines which re-examined sacramental teaching and were published in the years 1848 to 1853 ‚Äì may have propelled him towards the Roman Catholic Church, forcing him to finally make the decision he had struggled with for so many years. So extreme were his views on the Eucharist that they were considered heretical and once rumours of prosecution began to reach him in the summer of 1854 Robert‚Äôs mind was made up. On 30 August he recalled his subscription to the Oath of Supremacy and submitted his resignation from all his posts to the Archbishop and in October made the trip to Paris where he was to be received into the Church of Rome on All Saints‚Äô Eve. He was preparing for his (Roman Catholic) ordination when he died at Albano on 3 February 1857. He is buried in Rome at the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, near the Pantheon. His tomb is situated just outside the right transept of the church. Family Wilberforce was pre- deceased by his first wife Agnes Everilda Frances Wrangham (1800‚Äì1834) and second wife Jane Legard (d. 1854). He was survived by two sons, William Francis Wilberforce (1833‚Äì1905), Vicar of Brodsworth and president of the Oxford Union,The Oxford Union, 1823‚Äì1923, p. 315 and Edward Wilberforce (1834‚Äì1914), who became one of the masters of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Edward's son Lionel Robert Wilberforce (1861‚Äì1944) was in 1900 appointed professor of physics in the University of Liverpool, and his other children were: *Sir Herbert William Wrangham Wilberforce, Barrister (1864‚Äì1941) *Alexander (Alex) Basil Edward Wilberforce (1867‚Äì1902) *Evelyn Agnes Fannie Wilberforce (1872‚Äì1954) R.

Robert was regarded as one of the greatest scholars of the Oxford Movement and his knowledge of Christian doctrine not easily matched by his contemporaries. The contents of his library are testament to this with known collections surviving at Wilberforce House Museum, Hull and within the University of York‚Äôs Rare Books Library. The subject matter contained within these libraries is wide-ranging, reflecting the interests, passions and religious devotion of the Wilberforce family and are thought to have been actively used for self- improvement and religious inspiration as evidenced through the many examples of handwritten notes and annotations that can be found.

He was First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, deputy prime minister of the USSR and member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). He was executed during the Great Purge. Biography Stanis≈Çaw Kosior was born in 1889 in Wƒôgr√≥w in the Siedlce Governorate of the Russian Empire, in the region of Podlachia, to a Polish family of humble factory workers. Because of poverty, he emigrated to Yuzovka (modern Donetsk), where he worked at a steel mill. In 1907 he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and quickly became the head of the party's local branch. He was arrested and sacked from his job at the party later that year, and the following year felt obliged to leave the area due to police activity. He used connections to get re-appointed at the Sulin factory in 1909, but was soon arrested again and deported to the Pavlovsk mine. In 1913 he was transferred to Moscow and then to Kyiv and Kharkiv, where he organized local Communist cells. In 1915 he was arrested by the Okhrana (the Russian secret police) and exiled to Siberia. After the February Revolution Kosior moved to Petrograd, where he headed the local branch of the Bolsheviks and the Narva municipal committee. After the October Revolution Kosior moved to the German-controlled areas of the Ober-Ost and Ukraine, where he worked for the Bolshevik cause. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, he moved back to Russia, where in 1920 he became Secretary of the CPSU. In 1922 he became head of the Siberian branch of the CPSU. From 1925 to 1928 he was Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. From 1919, Kosior was for some time a member of Ukraine's Politburo. In 1928 he became General Secretary of the Ukrainian SSR Communist Party. Among his tasks was the collectivization of agriculture in Ukraine. In 1930 Kosior was admitted to the Politburo of the CPSU.

This act, if properly done, makes the entire second document a part of the main document. Incorporation by reference is often found in laws, regulations, contracts, legal and regulated documentation. In law regarding wills, it is a doctrine at common law which allows a testator, or a creator of a will, to dispose of assets in his estate in accordance with a separate document. To be valid, such a document must comply with the following requirements: # it must have existed at the time the will was executed; # the will must describe the document with particularity, so that it may be identified; and # the will must clearly manifest the intent that the document be incorporated. An exception to the first requirement is made for small gifts of tangible personal property, such as household furniture and items of sentimental value. Oral instructions can not be subject to incorporation by reference. For example, if a testator states in the will that he has recited to a third party the intended disposition of testamentary assets, such attempt to circumvent the requirements of a written will is void. In American administrative law, incorporation by reference is a drafting tool that enables federal agencies to give legal effect to materials that are already published elsewhere. This is allowed under a provision of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552(a)(1). Section 552(a) requires agencies to publish regulations in the Federal Register in order to enforce them. Section 552(a)(1) provides that if material published elsewhere is \\"reasonably available to the class of persons affected\\" and the Director of the Federal Register approves its incorporation by reference, that material will be \\"deemed published\\" in the Federal Register.

It is thought by most fitness instructors to be a significant component of the core. Structure The transverse abdominal, so called for the direction of its fibers, is the innermost of the flat muscles of the abdomen. It is positioned immediately inside of the internal oblique muscle. The transverse abdominal arises as fleshy fibers, from the lateral third of the inguinal ligament, from the anterior three-fourths of the inner lip of the iliac crest, from the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs, interdigitating with the diaphragm, and from the thoracolumbar fascia. It ends anteriorly in a broad aponeurosis (the Spigelian fascia), the lower fibers of which curve inferomedially (medially and downward), and are inserted, together with those of the internal oblique muscle, into the crest of the pubis and pectineal line, forming the inguinal conjoint tendon also called the aponeurotic falx. In layman's terms, the muscle ends in the middle line of a person's abdomen. Throughout the rest of its extent the aponeurosis passes horizontally to the middle line, and is inserted into the linea alba; its upper three-fourths lie behind the rectus muscle and blend with the posterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique; its lower fourth is in front of the rectus abdominis. =Innervation= The transverse abdominal is innervated by the lower intercostal nerves (thoracoabdominal, nerve roots T7-T11), as well as the iliohypogastric nerve and the ilioinguinal nerve. Function The transverse abdominal helps to compress the ribs and viscera, providing thoracic and pelvic stability. This is explained further here. The transverse abdominal also helps a pregnant woman to deliver her child. Without a stable spine, one aided by proper contraction of the TVA, the nervous system fails to recruit the muscles in the extremities efficiently, and functional movements cannot be properly performed. The transverse abdominal and the segmental stabilizers (e.g. the multifidi) of the spine have evolved to work in tandem. While it is true that the TVA is vital to back and core health, the muscle also has the effect of pulling in what would otherwise be a protruding abdomen (hence its nickname, the ‚Äúcorset muscle‚Äù). Training the rectus abdominis muscles alone will not and can not give one a \\"flat\\" belly; this effect is achieved only through training the TVA. Thus to the extent that traditional abdominal exercises (e.g. crunches) or more advanced abdominal exercises tend to \\"flatten\\" the belly, this is owed to the tangential training of the TVA inherent in such exercises. Recently the transverse abdominal has become the subject of debate between Biokineticists, kinesiologists, strength trainers, and physical therapists. The two positions on the muscle are (1) that the muscle is effective and capable of bracing the human core during extremely heavy lifts and (2) that it is not. Specifically, one recent systematic review has found that the baseline dysfunction of TVA cannot predict the clinical outcomes of low back pain. Similarly, another systematic review has revealed that the changes in TVA function or morphology after different nonsurgical treatments are unrelated to the improvement of pain intensity or low back pain related-disability. These findings have challenged the traditional emphasis of using TVA-targeted intervention to treat low back pain. = Exercise = The most well known method of strengthening the TVA is the vacuum exercise. The TVA also (involuntarily) contracts during many lifts; it is the body's natural weight-lifting belt, stabilizing the spine and pelvis during lifting movements. It has been estimated that the contraction of the TVA and other muscles reduces the vertical pressure on the intervertebral discs by as much as 40%. Failure to engage the TVA during higher intensity lifts is dangerous and encourages injury to the spine. The TVA acts as a girdle or corset by creating hoop tension around the midsection.

Gyeongju is a major cultural site and tourist destination for South Koreans and foreigners with about 8 to 9 million visitors annually.Gyeongju, Museum without Walls A great deal of this is due to the city's status as a center of Silla heritage, derived from its former role as the capital of that ancient kingdom. Silla remains Many Silla sites are included in Gyeongju National Park. In addition, the Gyeongju National Museum hosts many artifacts from the Silla kingdom which have been excavated from sites within the city and surrounding areas, including several royal crowns and other national treasures. Some of Gyeongju's most famous sites relate to the Silla government's patronage of Buddhism. The grotto of Seokguram and the temple of Bulguksa were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, in 1995. In addition, the ruins of the old Hwangnyongsa temple, said to have been Korean's largest, are preserved on the slopes of Toham Mountain. Various Silla-era stone carvings of Buddhas and bodhisattvas are found on mountainsides throughout the city, particularly on Namsan. The Gyerim, or \\"Chicken Forest,\\" adjoins the Royal Tomb Complex in central Gyeongju. So does the Anapji pond, the Poseokjeong garden site, and the Cheomseongdae observatory. Each site is deeply woven into the legends and history of the Silla period. A number of fortresses from the Silla period have been preserved. These include the Wolseong and Myeonghwal fortresses in the downtown area, and the Bu Mountain Fortress in Geoncheon-eup. =Tombs= Tumuli Park, in the center of town, and its Burial Mounds Buddhist statues on Namsan, near Gyeongju The tombs of the rulers of Silla are all located within the boundaries of Gyeongju. The identity of the ruler is known in many cases, particularly for the later rulers. However, many of the older tombs found in the Royal Tombs Complex cannot be conclusively tied to any ruler. Partly for this reason, many of the tombs are known by the names of notable artifacts excavated there. One example of this is the Heavenly Horse Tomb, where a mudflap bearing a celestial horse motif was found. Not all of the Silla-era tombs are royal. The tomb of the general Kim Yu-sin is located on one of the low mountains surrounding Gyeongju Basin. A notable tomb outside the usual historical precincts of Gyeongju is that of King Munmu, d. 681, who was buried at sea just off the coast of Yangbuk-myeon. Munmu, the first king of Unified Silla, instructed that he should be buried there so that he could become a dragon and protect the Silla coastline. Later sites Although Gyeongju no longer played a particularly central role during the Joseon Dynasty, a number of relics from that period have been preserved alongside the Silla sites. A few seowon, Confucian private schools which dotted the Korean countryside during the Joseon Dynasty, have been preserved. Seoak seowon is situated in the downtown area, and Oksan Seowon is preserved in Angang-eup. In Gangdong- myeon, a folk village keeps up the appearances of the late Joseon period. Adjacent to the Royal Tombs Complex in downtown Gyeongju, the houses of the Gyodong neighborhood also keep the hanok form they had in Joseon times. There are also important architecture built in the Joseon Dynasty. Gyeongju Seokbinggo is a seokbinggo or ice house located in the neighborhood of Inwang- dong, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It was originally built in the Wolseong Fortress in 1738, the 14th year of King Yeongju. The Gyeongju Seokbinggo has been designated as the 66th Treasure of South Korea and managed by the Department of Culture and Tourism of the Gyeongju City.Gyeongju Seokbinggo (Stone ice storage in Gyeongju) Gyeongju U-tourism OrganizationScientific Invention The Overseas Koreans Foundation(in Korean) Í≤ΩÏ£ºÏÑùÎπôÍ≥† ÊÖ∂Â∑ûÁü≥Ê∞∑Â∫´ Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean CultureDowntown Gyeongju Vicinity Kyeongbuk Tourism Development Corporation Gyodong includes the main house of the Gyeongju Choi clan, which is also a famed brewery of beopju. Conferences and festivals A significant portion of Gyeongju's tourist traffic is due to the city's successful promotion of itself as a site for various festivals, conferences, and competitions. Every year since 1962 a Silla Cultural Festival (Ïã†ÎùºÎ¨∏ÌôîÏ†ú) has been held in October to celebrate and honour the dynasty's history and culture. It is one of the major festivals of Korea. It features athletic events, folk games, music, dance, literary contests and Buddhist religious ceremonies. Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April, the Korean Traditional Drink and Rice Cake Festival in March, and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu-sin. Resorts and theme parks The area surrounding the Bomun Lake reservoir, 6 km east of central Gyeongju, has been transformed into a resort area. A theme park named Gyeongju World is located on the reservoir's western shore, as is the Seonjae Art Gallery and the Bomun Outdoor Performance Hall. The Gyeongju World Culture Expo is held every 2‚Äì3 years in at Expo Park just south of the lake. Many of the city's principal hotels are also located in this area. Other resorts and hotels are found throughout the city.

Other sources cite a Dick Ware, Dick Wise, or Dick Wine. As the title suggests this novelty song is a waltz in triple metre, but it also contains a bass riff that is reminiscent of typical boogie woogie and rock and roll riffs. The song is told from the point of view of a teenager who comes home early from a date, and catches her parents attempting to dance to one of her rock and roll records; only, having no frame of reference, the couple tries to waltz to the music. The Kay Starr recording of the song, made in 1955, reached number one on the Billboard singles chart in 1956, staying there for six weeks. The recording was released by RCA Victor as catalog number 47-6359. It was Kay Starr's first recording of great significance for RCA Victor after leaving Capitol Records. She had a number of lesser chart entries on RCA in 1955, including \\"Good and Lonesome\\" and \\"Turn Right\\". She thought it was a joke when the A&R; staff at RCA Victor picked it for her; it was so different from what she was used to recording. It was a No. 1 hit, a million seller, and one of the early songs of the rock and roll era. The track also spent one week at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1956. Other artists who recorded this song include Ann-Margret (in 1962), Annette Funicello (in 1961), Lawrence Welk and His Champagne Music with Alice Lon on vocals (in 1956, Coral EC 81128), and George Wright in his 1984 album Red Hot and Blue.

In the latter part of the 18th century, when tall narrow sash windows were almost universal, the window seat was in high favor, and was no doubt in keeping with the formalism of Georgian interiors. It differed much in decorative detail, but little in form. It stood as high from the floor as a chair; the two ends were identical, with a roll-over curve, more or less pronounced. The seats and ends were usually upholstered in rich fabrics which in many cases have remained intact. The legs followed the fashion in chairs and were square and tapered, or, somewhat later, round and reeded. Hepplewhite and the brothers Adam designed many graceful window seats, but they were produced by all the cabinet-makers of the period.

Biography Roth was born in Tysmenitz near Stanislawow, Galicia, Austro-Hungary (now known as Tysmenytsia, near Ivano-Frankivsk, Galicia, Ukraine). Although his parents never agreed on the exact date of his arrival in the United States, it is most likely that he landed at Ellis Island and began his life in New York in 1908. He briefly lived in Brooklyn, and then on the Lower East Side, in the slums where his classic novel Call It Sleep is set. In 1914, the family moved to Harlem. Roth lived there until 1927, when, as a senior at City College of New York, he moved in with Eda Lou Walton, a poet and New York University instructor who lived on Morton Street in Greenwich Village. With Walton's support, he began Call It Sleep in about 1930, and completed the novel in the spring of 1934, publishing in December 1934, to mixed reviews. In the 1960s, Roth's Call It Sleep underwent a critical reappraisal after being republished in 1964. With 1,000,000 copies sold, and many weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, the novel was hailed as an overlooked Depression-era masterpiece and classic novel of immigration. Today, it is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Jewish American literature. After the book's publication, Roth began a second novel that was contracted with editor Maxwell Perkins, of Scribner's. But Roth's growing ideological frustration and personal confusion created a profound writer's block, which lasted until 1979, when he began the earliest drafts of Mercy of a Rude Stream (although material written much earlier than 1979 was also incorporated into this later work). In 1938, during an unproductive sojourn at the artists' colony Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York, Roth met Muriel Parker, a pianist and composer; much of this period is depicted in Roth's final work, An American Type. Roth severed his relationship with Walton, moved out of her apartment, and married Parker in 1939, to the disapproval of her family. With the onset of World War II, Roth became a tool and gauge maker. The couple moved first to Boston with their two young sons, Jeremy and Hugh, and then in 1946 to Maine. There Roth worked as a woodsman, a schoolteacher, a psychiatric attendant in the state mental hospital, a waterfowl farmer, and a Latin and math tutor. Arthur Hertzberg credited editor Harold U. Ribalow with \\"rediscovering\\" Roth. Ribelow found him on a farm in Maine and persuaded him to permit a new edition of the novel. Ribalow wrote an introduction to the new edition, which was published by Pageant Books in 1960. Many years later, after Ribalow had died and Roth was awarded the Ribalow Prize, he wrote to Ribalow's son, Meir Z. Ribalow, \\"Thanks for the encomia. Things like that keep me alive, I'm sure: what little is left me capable of feeling swells with pride like the staves of an old barrel when filled. Harold, to whom I owe so much, would have been happy to witness the occasion.\\" In fact, Roth did not initially welcome the success of the 1964 reprint of Call It Sleep, valuing his privacy instead. However, his writing block slowly began to break. In 1968, after Muriel's retirement from the Maine state school system, the couple moved to a trailer home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, near where Roth had stayed as writer-in- residence at the D. H. Lawrence ranch outside of Taos. Muriel began composing music again, while Roth collaborated with his friend and Italian translator, Mario Materassi, to put out a collection of essays called Shifting Landscape, published by the Jewish Publication Society in 1987. After Muriel's death in 1990, Roth moved into a ramshackle former funeral parlor and occupied himself with revising the final volumes of his monumental work, Mercy of a Rude Stream. It has been alleged that the incestuous relationships between the protagonist, a sister, and a cousin in Mercy of a Rude Stream are based on Roth's life. Roth's own sister denied that such events occurred. Roth failed to garner the acclaim some say he deserves, perhaps because after the publication of Call It Sleep he failed to produce another novel for sixty years. Roth attributed his massive writer's block to personal problems such as depression, and to political conflicts, including his disillusion with Communism. At other times he cited his early break with Judaism and his obsessive sexual preoccupations as probable causes. Roth died in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States in 1995. The character E. I. Lonoff in Philip Roth's Zuckerman novels (The Ghost Writer and Exit Ghost in this case), is a composite of Roth, Bernard Malamud and fictional elements.Joshua Cohen, \\"A Life Torn Between Myth and Fact,\\" The Forward, October 2, 2007 Works and writing=Call It Sleep= Published in 1934, Call It Sleep centers on the turbulent experiences of a young boy, David Schearl, growing up in the Jewish immigrant slum of New York's Lower East Side in the early twentieth century. =Mercy of a Rude Stream= Mercy of a Rude Stream is a monumental epic published in four volumes. It follows protagonist Ira Stigman from his family's arrival in Jewish-Irish Harlem in 1914 to the night before Thanksgiving in 1927, when Ira decides to leave the family tenement and move in with Edith Welles. According to critic David Mehegan, Roth's Mercy represents a \\"landmark of the American literary century\\".Weil 1998. The first volume, A Star Shines over Mt. Morris Park was published in 1994 by St. Martin's Press and the second volume, called A Diving Rock on the Hudson, appeared from St. Martin's in 1995. From Bondage, which appeared in hardcover in 1996, was the first volume of the four Mercy books to appear posthumously. Requiem for Harlem, the fourth and final volume, appeared in 1998. Roth was able to revise both the third and fourth volumes in 1994 and 1995 with the help of his assistant, Felicia Steele, shortly before his death. Before his death, Roth commented numerous times that Mercy of a Rude Stream comprised six volumes. In fact, Roth did write six separate books. He called the first four \\"Batch One,\\" and the last two, \\"Batch Two.\\" Roth's editor at St. Martin's, Robert Weil, along with Felicia Steele, Larry Fox, and Roth's agent, Roslyn Targ, found the epic would be best served in four volumes, as the four books of \\"Batch One\\" contained a stylistic and thematic unity inconsistent with the remaining two books. Explaining the difference between Mercy of a Rude Stream and Call It Sleep, critic Mario Materassi, Roth's longtime friend, argues that \\"Call It Sleep can be read as a vehicle through which, soon after breaking away from his family and his tradition, young Roth used some of the fragments of his childhood to shore up the ruins of what he already felt was a disconnected self. Forty-five years later, Roth embarked on another attempt to bring some retrospective order to his life's confusion: Mercy of a Rude Stream, which he has long called a 'continuum,' can be read as a final, monumental effort on the part of the elderly author to come to terms with the pattern of rupture and discontinuity that has marked his life\\". =An American Type= Roth's final novel, An American Type, emerged from \\"Batch 2,\\" which Roth wrote during the late 1980s and early 1990s. With his assistant's help, Roth produced 1,900 typed pages of scenes beginning where Mercy left off and continuing through 1990. The manuscript of \\"Batch 2\\" remained untouched for over a decade until Weil sent it to The New Yorker, which published two excerpts from \\"Batch 2\\" in the summer of 2006 under the titles \\"God the Novelist\\" and \\"Freight.\\" At The New Yorker the book came into the hands of Willing Davidson, then a young assistant in the magazine's fiction department. At the suggestion of Weil and Roth's literary executor, Lawrence Fox, Davidson edited \\"Batch 2\\" into An American Type, which was published by W.W. Norton in 2010.Davidson, Willing. \\"Editor's Afterword.\\" An American Type. (W.W. Norton, 2010): 275‚Äì279 Both a love story and a lamentation, the novel opens in 1938, and reintroduces us to Ira Stigman of the Mercy cycle, a thirty-two-year-old \\"slum-born Yiddle\\" eager to assimilate but traumatized by his impoverished immigrant past. Restless with his lover and literary mentor, English professor Edith Welles, Ira journeys to Yaddo, where he meets M (who only appeared in the old man's reveries in the Mercy series), a blond, aristocratic pianist whose \\"calm, Anglo-Saxon radiance\\" engages him. The ensuing romantic crisis, as well as the conflict between his ghetto Jewish roots and the bourgeois comforts of Manhattan, forces Ira to abandon his paramour's Greenwich Village apartment and set out with an illiterate, boorish Communist on a quest for the promise of the American West. But feeling like a total failure in LA, Ira begins an epic journey home, thumbing rides from truckers and riding the rails with hobos through the Dust Bowl. Ira only knows that he must return to M, the woman he truly loves. Sixty-five pages of excerpts from Batch Two consisting of short journal entries appeared in the journal, Fiction, Number 57, in 2011. The majority of these pages are about Roth's move to Maine, afraid that his associations with the Communist Party would haunt him at his factory job in Massachusetts. Purchasing a small farm, and surrounded by Yankee neighbors, Roth questions his identity as a Jew and struggles to wrest a living out of a Maine countryside where the soil is so hard that he has to dynamite in order to lay pipe deep enough to avoid the winter freezes. The extreme cold that he and his family endured, his work logging, bargaining over antiques and livestock with neighbors, and the world of backwoods and village America form the principal and unlikely drama of these pages. There is also return to the tense, incestuous world of the Roth family in Henry's childhood in the last of these extracts. =Themes= Henry Roth's writing centers on immigrant experience, particularly a Jewish-American experience in Depression-era America. He has also been hailed as a chronicler of New York city life. Roth's work reveals an obsession with cultural depravity: the internal dislocation of the intellectual and of society at large that features so prominently in the work of the greatest Modernist writers. Indeed, Roth often fixates on human depravity in a multitude of forms. Sexually abhorrent acts such as incest, infidelity, and predation, for instance, inform much of his work. As does a more general climate of violence or abuse, often both inflicted on others and masochistically turned inwards. Throughout his life, Roth simultaneously embraced and rejected the notion of a forgiving God, and this ambivalence is also registered in his writing. Mario Materassi suggests, in \\"Shifting Urbanscape: Roth's 'Private' New York\\" that Roth \\"has never been interested in any story other than the anguished one of a man who, throughout his life, has contradicted each of his previously held positions and beliefs.\\" While Roth's works are generally tragic, and often relentlessly so, his later work holds out for the possibility of redemption, or of mercy in a rude stream. This notion is especially evident in An American Type where the love between Ira and M becomes a means of transcendence. Awards and honors While still alive, Roth received two honorary doctorates, one from the University of New Mexico and one from the Hebrew Union College‚ÄìJewish Institute of Religion. Posthumously, he was honored in 1995 with the Hadassah Harold Ribalow Lifetime Achievement Award and by the Museum of the City of New York with Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger having named February 29, 1996, as \\"Henry Roth Day\\" in New York City. From Bondage was cited by the National Book Critics Circle as being a finalist for its Fiction Prize in 1997, and it was in that same year that Henry Roth won the first Isaac Bashevis Singer Prize in Literature for From Bondage, an award put out by The Forward Foundation. In 2005, ten years after Roth's death, the first full biography of his life, the prize-winning Redemption: The Life of Henry Roth, by literary scholar Steven G. Kellman, was published, followed in 2006 by Henry Roth's centenary, which was marked by a literary tribute at the New York Public Library, sponsored by CCNY and organized by Lawrence I. Fox, Roth's literary executor.

Biography He was born at Caludon or Calledon, Warwickshire, the son of a farmer, and was apprenticed to a Coventry printer and bookseller. In 1789 he set up a small printing press in a garret off Fleet Street, London, with a loan obtained from the typefounding firm of William Caslon, and, by 1797, his business had so increased that he was enabled to move into larger premises. An edition of Gray's Poems, printed by him in 1799, secured him the patronage of all the leading publishers. Whittingham inaugurated the idea of printing cheap, handy editions of standard authors, and, on the bookselling trade threatening not to sell his productions, took a room at a coffee house and sold them by auction himself. In 1809, he started a paper-pulp factory at Chiswick, near London, and in 1811 founded the Chiswick Press. From 1810 to 1815 he devoted his chief attention to illustrated books and is credited with having been the first to use proper overlays in printing woodcuts, as he was the first to print a fine, or \\"Indian Paper\\" edition. He was one of the first to use a steam engine in a pulp mill, but his presses he preferred to have worked by hand. He died at Chiswick. His nephew Charles Whittingham (1795‚Äì1876), who from 1824 to 1828 had been in partnership with his uncle, in 1838 assumed control of the business. He already had printing works at Took's Court, Chancery Lane, London, and had printed various notable books, especially devoting himself to the introduction of ornamental initial letters, and the artistic arrangement of the printed page. The imprint of the Chiswick press was now placed on the productions of the Took's Court as well as of the Chiswick works, and in 1852 the whole business was removed to London. Under the management of the younger Whittingham, the Chiswick Press achieved a considerable reputation. He died on 21 April 1876.

The South African government added a National Language Unit for South African Sign Language in 2001. SASL is not the only manual language used in South Africa, but it is the language that is being promoted as the language to be used by the Deaf in South Africa,Aarons, Debra and Philemon Aakach. South African Sign Language: one language or many? In Language in South Africa, ed by Rajend Mesthrie, 127-147. Cambridge University Press. although Deaf peoples in South Africa historically do not form a single group. In 1995, the previous South African National Council for the Deaf (SANCD) was transformed into the Deaf Federation of South Africa (DeafSA), which resulted in a radical policy change in matters for Deaf people in South Africa, such as the development and adoption of a single sign language and the promotion of sign language over oralism. Schools for the deaf have remained largely untransformed, however, and different schools for Deaf children in South African still use different sign language systems, and at a number of schools for the Deaf the use of any sign language is either discouraged or simply not taught.PDF page 4, document page 114 There are as many as twelve different systems of signed oral language in South Africa. In addition to South African sign languages, American Sign Language (ASL) is also used by some Deaf people in South Africa. Most local sign languages in South Africa show the influence of American Sign Language. SASL is the sign language that is used during television news casts in South Africa. Sign language is also used in the South African parliament, but different sign language interpreters are known to use different signs for the same concepts. There are around 40 schools for the Deaf in South Africa, most using a variety of SASL. Sign language is explicitly mentioned in the South African constitution, and the South African Schools Act permits the study of the language in lieu of another official language at school. By 2011, there were 84 SASL interpreters on DeafSA's interpreter register, including 43 without any training, 31 who have completed 240 study hours of interpreter training, and 10 who have gained an additional 3 years' experience and completed a further 480 study hours. A total of 7 SASL interpreters have actually been accredited by SATI/DeafSA. SASL interpreters can apply for accreditation without having completed any formal training in SASL.  Status  South African Sign Language is not entirely uniform and continues to evolve. Due to the geographical spread of its users and past educational policies, there are localised dialects of South African Sign Language and signs with many variants. Earlier efforts to create reference material and standardise the language, such as books (1980 Talking to the Deaf, 1994 Dictionary of SASL), can only be used as historical records of the language. Daily TV broadcasts in sign language give today's South African Sign Language its national cohesion and unity. = Official recognition = Sign language is mentioned in four South African laws, namely the Constitution, the Use of Official Languages Act, the South African Schools Act, and the Pan South African Language Board Act.  General recognition  The Constitution states that a board named the Pan South African Language Board should be established to \\"promote, and create conditions for, the development and use of ... sign language\\".Constitution of the Republic of South Africa section 6.5.8.iii In terms of the law that establishes the Pan South African Language Board (Act 59 of 1995), the board may establish language bodies to advise it on \\"any particular language, sign language or augmentative and alternative communication\\". Pan South African Language Board Act, Act 59 of 1995 section 8(8)(b) In terms of the Use of Official Languages Act, Act No. 12 of 2012, all government departments and government entities must have a language policy that states which languages are considered the official languages of that entity, and each language policy must also specify how that department or entity intends to communicate with people whose language of choice is \\"South African sign language\\". Use of Official Languages Act, Act No. 12 of 2012 section 4.2(d) Neither South African Sign Language nor any other sign language is an official language of South Africa. In 2008 the SASL Policy Implementation Conference gathered many key role players including scholars, researchers and teachers, policy makers, advocates and governmental bodies to promote South African Sign Language to become recognised as South Africa's twelfth official language.  Educational recognition  According to the South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996, all schools must have a language policy, and that when selecting languages for such a policy, a \\"recognised Sign Language\\" should be evaluated as if it has official language status along with the other eleven official languages. South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996 section 6(4) According to the \\"Language in Education\\" policy in terms of section 3(4)(m) of the National Education Policy Act, Act 27 of 1996, the main aims of the Ministry of Education‚Äôs policy for language in education include \\"to support the teaching and learning of all other languages required by learners or used by communities in South Africa, including languages used for religious purposes, languages which are important for international trade and communication, and South African Sign Language, as well as Alternative and Augmentative Communication\\".\\"Language in Education\\" policy in terms of section 3(4)(m) of the National Education Policy Act, Act 27 of 1996 South African Sign Language is accepted as one of the languages of instruction in the education of Deaf learners. = Demographics = The number of deaf people in South Africa (600,000 deaf and 1.4 million people with hearing loss)(2003). DeafSA Information Booklet. South Africa: DeafSA. does not give an accurate depiction of the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language. There is currently no estimate for the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language in South Africa. Estimates vary greatly, from 700,000 to 2 million users. A request was made to the Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa) to measure this as part of the 2011 census.  Linguistic features = Fingerspelling = South African Sign Language one-handed manual alphabet for fingerspelling Fingerspelling is a manual technique of signing used to spell letters and numbers (numerals, cardinals). Therefore, fingerspelling is a sign language technique for borrowing words from spoken languages, as well as for spelling names of people, places and objects. It is a practical tool to refer to the written word. Some words which are often fingerspelled tend to become signs in their own right (becoming \\"frozen\\"), following linguistic transformation processes such as alphanumeric incorporation and abbreviation. For instance, one of the sign-names for Cape Town uses incorporated fingerspelled letters C.T. ( transition from handshape for letter 'C' to letter 'T' of both wrists with rotation on an horizontal axis). The month of July is often abbreviated as 'J-L-Y'. Fingerspelling words is not a substitute for using existing signs: it takes longer to sign and it is harder to perceive. If the fingerspelled word is a borrowing, fingerspelling depends on both users having knowledge of the oral language (English, Sotho, Afrikaans etc.). Although proper names (such as a person's name, a company name) are often fingerspelled, it is often a temporary measure until the Deaf community agrees on a Sign name replacement. = Sign-names and Idioms = Sign names are specific signs which are associated with proper names (a location, a person, an organisation). Sign names are often chosen based on a salient physical property. For instance, the sign name for Nelson Mandela is signed using a flat B-hand that follows a hair-line over the head. The sign name for the bank ABSA is made with both hands following the movement implied in the company corporate logo. = Variation = South Africa is one of a few countries to have legal recognition of sign language.(1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. . There is presumably some regional variation, but signers from across the country can readily understand each other, as demonstrated for example at the annual Deaf Forum. It is commonly believed among South Africans, even among Deaf South Africans, that different language communities have different sign languages. This is evidently the result of the Deaf not being able to understand sign-language interpreters from other communities. However, this is because such \\"interpreters\\" do not actually use sign language, but rather Signed English, Signed Xhosa, etc., and only those who have been schooled in these artificial codes can understand them.

History of education of the Deaf in South Africa  Timeline: * 1863 Irish nuns start training programmes in sign language * 1874 Grimley Institute for the Deaf and Dumb established by Bridget Lynne in Cape Town * 1881 De La Bat school established in Worcester * 1920 Adoption of oralism in Deaf schools * 1934 Separation between European and Non-European schools * 1941 First school \\"for the Black Deaf\\" established * 1984 Medium of education changed from vernacular (native tongue) to English in Department Of Education and Training schools * 1996 \\"Sign language\\" (but not specifically SASL) mentioned in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa as a language to be promoted As early as 1863, Irish nuns were involved in training programmes for the Deaf. Irish Sign Language, \\"originally heavily influenced by French Sign Language\\" is said to have had a noticeable influence in sign languages in the world, including in South Africa. In 1874 in Cape Town, the first institution for the Deaf called Grimley Institute for Deaf and Dumb was established by an Irish Deaf woman named Bridget Lynne. In 1881 in Worcester, De La Bat school for the Deaf was established. From 1877, Dominican sisters started to settle near Durban. In 1884, Sister Stephanie Hanshuber from Germany introduced the oral method in South Africa. In 1888 \\"King William's Town Convent School for the Education of the Deaf\\" was formally opened. \\"Since there is little historical evidence, it is presumed that South African Sign Language has a mixture of the Irish influence from the Dominican Irish nuns, and British influence as well as the American influence.

Kingsbury Curtis, Samuel Riber, Jr., Archer Milton Huntington, and Harmon Washington Hendricks. Archer Milton Huntington (March 10, 1870 - December 11, 1955) was the son of Arabella (n√©e Duval) Huntington and the adopted, possibly biological, son of railroad magnate and industrialist Collis P. Huntington. A lifelong friend of the academy and the arts, he is known for his scholarly works in the field of Hispanic Studies and for founding The Hispanic Society of America in New York City, as well as his many contributions to the American Geographical Society. He was also a major benefactor of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Numismatic Society, which he convinced to relocate next to the Hispanic Society and the Geographical Society at the Beaux Arts Audubon Terrace complex in upper Manhattan. In 1932, he and sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, then his wife, founded the Brookgreen Gardens sculpture center in South Carolina; and the Mariners' Museum, which is one of the largest maritime museums in the world, in Newport News, Virginia, a new independent city that was established in the late 19th century largely though the efforts of his adopted father Collis P. Huntington. Hispanic studies Huntington is primarily known for his scholarly works in the field of Hispanic Studies and for founding The Hispanic Society of America in New York City. The society, founded in 1904, is a museum and rare books library whose collections of Hispanic materials are unrivaled outside Spain. Spanish impressionist painter Joaquin Sorolla met Huntington in England in 1908. Huntington soon made him a member of the Hispanic Society, and invited him to exhibit there in 1909. This grand exhibition comprised 356 paintings, 195 of which sold. Sorolla spent five months in America and painted more than twenty portraits.Peel, Edmund: The Painter Joaquin Sorolla, Philip Wilson Publishers, Ltd., 1989, pp. 246-247 Ayamonte or La pesca del at√∫n (1919). This is the last of Joaquin Sorolla's 14 murals completed for the Hispanic Society in Manhattan. In 1911, Huntington contracted with Sorolla to paint 14 magnificent murals that came to be known as Vision of Spain. These are considered to be the major commission of Sorolla's career. His enormous canvases hang in the Sorolla Room of the Hispanic Society building in Manhattan; the room was opened in 1926 following Sorolla's death. A major restoration of this room was completed in 2010. During the restoration of the Sorolla Room, the murals toured major art museums in Spain. Shortly after 1920, Huntington launched the careers of six art historians in the Hispanic field: Elizabeth du Gu√© Trapier, Beatrice Gilman Proske, Alice Wilson Frothingham, Florence Lewis May, Eleanor Sherman Font, and Clara Louisa Penney, with three in particular (Proske, Frothingham, and May) creating the seminal works in their fields. Huntington's wife, Anna Hyatt Huntington, sculpted the bronze statues and limestone bas-reliefs that stand outside the entrance to the Hispanic Society building.  The American Geographical Society  Archer Huntington became a Fellow of the American Geographical Society in 1894 and a Councilor in 1904, the same year he founded the Hispanic Society of America. In 1907, Huntington was elected President of the American Geographical Society. Huntington donated land on Audubon Terrace to the AGS in 1911 and ‚Äúcontributed the greater part of the cost of construction‚Äù for the new building himself; Huntington also provided generous financial assistance to the AGS throughout his tenure as member. Huntington was one of the Society's most influential leaders; he provided new facilities which enabled the AGS to expand its ‚Äústaff, collections, and activities,‚Äù arranged for the AGS to conduct a transcontinental excursion for geographers around the world in 1912, balanced the Society's budget, expanded its library, coordinated a collaboration between the AGS and the Association of American Geographers, and selected Isaiah Bowman as the first Director of the American Geographical Society. Huntington was also responsible for the acquisition of the American Geographical Society Library's oldest world map: the Leardo Mappamundi. Huntington donated the 15th century map to the AGS of NY in 1906 and the map now resides in the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In a letter honoring Huntington after his death in 1955, the Society stated that Huntington would be remembered for his work bringing many institutions together with ‚Äúacademic dignity and repose.‚Äù Philanthropy In 1915, Huntington donated land on which the American Academy of Arts and Letters could construct a permanent New York City home. \\"Huntington Gives Site for Academy; Men of Arts and Letters to Erect Building Near Riverside Drive and 155th St. Next to Hispanic Museum; National Institute and American Academy Accept Offer of Eight City Lots for Site,\\" New York Times. January 25, 1915. He also donated land and funds to relocate the Numismatic Society and the Museum of the American Indian to Audubon Terrace, the same complex that housed Huntington's many other beloved organizations. The Huntingtons' Brookgreen Gardens, the setting with sculpture 'Athlete' by Rudulph Evans (1915). In 1932 he donated land and helped to create Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, a public sculpture garden in which to display the figurative sculpture works of American sculptors, including many pieces by Anna Hyatt Huntington. A portion of Brookgreen Gardens is a nature reserve, and another section is leased to the state for Huntington Beach State Park. The gardens, historic plantation sites, and their adjacent residence 'Atalaya Castle' are a National Historic Landmark, and on the National Register of Historic Places. In that same year, working with Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company president Homer L. Ferguson, Huntington founded the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, one of the largest maritime museums in the world. In 1936, Huntington created an endowment which established an annual stipend for a Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, now officially the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. In 2006, this stipend amounted to $40,000 per year, including a $35,000 salary and $5,000 in travel expenses. From 1932-39, the Huntingtons donated what was to become the 15,000 acre Archer Milton Huntington and Anna Hyatt Huntington Wildlife Forest in Newcomb, New York, now part of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. In 1939, the Huntingtons donated their mansion at 1083 Fifth Avenue and adjacent properties between 89th & 90th Streets to the National Academy, the oldest artists' organization in the United States. The property is home to the National Academy Museum and Art School. Family Archer Huntington's family included several prominent cousins. The New York City architect Charles P. Huntington included.Charles P. Huntington; of 18 West 31st Street, New York City. His cousin Henry E.

On August 6, 1895, he married Helen Manchester Gates, the daughter of Rev. Isaac E. Gates and Ellen M. H. Gates, a poet and the sister of Archer's adopted father Collis P. Huntington. Like her mother, Helen was a writer. Archer and Helen were temporarily detained and effectively under arrest by German authorities in Nuremberg, Bavaria, at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 due to suspicions that Archer, a representative of the American Geographical Society, was a spy. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan appealed for their release through diplomatic channels.\\"Ships for Tourists will be Chartered,\\" NY Evening Post, Aug. 12, 1914.

For example, Joey leaves the contents of his bank account \\"to my employees.\\" If Joey then fires some of old employees and hires new ones, the new employees will inherit the contents of the bank account under this provision. #The testator devises a general type of property, and then changes the specific items of property within that category. For example, Joey writes in his will, \\"I leave my car to Rachel\\". Joey drives a 1974 AMC Gremlin at the time of the testamentary instrument, but later sells the Gremlin and purchases a 2016 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coup√© with suicide doors and teak paneling. Because Joey bought a new car to get a more comfortable ride, rather than to change a will without going through the testamentary formalities, the gift to Rachel remains enforceable. The Uniform Probate Code states, :A will may dispose of property by reference to acts and events that have significance apart from their effect upon the dispositions made by the will, whether they occur before or after the execution of the will or before or after the testator's death. The execution or revocation of another individual's will is such an event.Uniform Probate Code, ¬ß2-512 Events of Independent Significance References Category:Wills and trusts ","title":"Acts of independent significance"},{"id":"2279880","text":"The Hispanic Society's 1930 north building (left) and sculptures Certificate of member for Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s. The Hispanic Society of America is a museum and reference library for the study of the arts and cultures of Spain and Portugal and their former colonies in Latin America, the Philippines and Portuguese India. (Despite the name and the founder's intention, it has never functioned as a learned association.) Founded in 1904 by Archer M. Huntington, the institution remains at its original location in a 1908 Beaux Arts building on Audubon Terrace (at 155th Street and Broadway) in the lower Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City in the United States. A second building, on the north side of the terrace, was added in 1930. Exterior sculpture in front of that building includes work by Anna Hyatt Huntington and nine major reliefs by the Swiss-American sculptor Berthold Nebel, a commission that took ten years to complete. The Hispanic Society complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012. In 2017, the museum began a major renovation and is closed to the public until the work is completed. Much of the collection is on loan to other institutions during this period. Collections The museum contains more than 18,000 works in every medium, ranging from prehistoric times to the 20th century. There are important paintings by Diego Vel√°zquez, Francisco de Goya, El Greco, and Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, among others, as well as sculpture and architectural elements, furniture and metalwork, ceramics and textiles. A major component of this museum is the Sorolla Room which was reinstalled in 2010. It displays The Provinces of Spain, 14 massive paintings commissioned by Archer Huntington in 1911 that Sorolla created from 1913 to 1919. These magnificent paintings, totaling over 200 linear feet (61 m), ring the large room and depict scenes from the regions of Spain. The library contains over 250,000 books, 200,000 documents, 175,000 photographs, and 15,000 prints. The rare books library maintains 15,000 books printed before 1700, including a first edition of Don Quijote. It also holds the manuscript Black Book of Hours Horae Beatae Virginis Mariae ad usum Romanum (circa 1458), one of only a handful of such works, and the enormous Map of the World (1526) by Juan Vespucci. Renovations In April 2015 the society announced the appointment of Philippe de Montebello to chair the society's Board of Overseers and spearhead a major effort to roughly double the museum's size by renovating the vacant Beaux Arts former building of the Museum of the American Indian, adjacent to the society's original museum building. Beginning January 1, 2017, the museum is closed for extensive renovations, although the library is open on a limited basis by appointment only. The $15 million project will replace the building's roof and lighting.Hispanic Society of America to Close on New Year's Day for More Than 2 Years, ny1.com, December 30, 2016, accessed March 2, 2017 Originally scheduled to reopen in the fall of 2019, the museum is still closed as of late 2020.

Biography Herbert Adams was born at West Concord, Vermont. In 1863, at the age of five, he moved to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, so his father could take a job at the Putnam Machine Co. His family purchased a home on 26 Chestnut Street. He attended the Fitchburg public schools, the Academy and was influenced by Fitchburg's first Art teacher, Louise Haskell, to pursue a career in Art. He attended Massachusetts Normal School in Boston and got a teaching certificate. Herbert Adams taught Art in the Fitchburg Public schools from 1878‚Äì1882, but left Fitchburg for Paris France in 1885 to pursue his interest in sculpture. He was educated at the Massachusetts Normal Art School enrolling in 1877 at 18 years of age, and in 1885-1890 he was a pupil of Antonin Merci√© in Paris. In 1889 Rodney Wallace, James Phillips, and Henry Willis donated money for an ornamental fountain to grace the Upper Common of Fitchburg, MA and the City accepted the idea. This 26 foot in diameter granite and bronze fountain depicting two playful boys and a family of turtles was the first public commission awarded to Adams and was created in his Paris studio. This was the first, large sculpture, done in the \\"lost-wax\\" process, brought to America. During Adams lifetime he completed over 200 major public works of art, and is considered to be one of the most important American sculptors. In 1890-1898 he was an instructor in the art school of Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. He was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1898, and in 1906 was elected vice-president of the National Academy of Design, New York. Adams later served as President from 1917-1920. He experimented successfully with some polychrome busts and tinted marbles, notably in the Rabbi's Daughter (1894), and a portrait of the actress Julia Marlowe (1898). He was at his best in his portrait busts of women, the best example being the study, completed in 1887, of Miss Adeline Pond, whom he later married. He was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1915 to 1920, serving as vice chairman from 1918 to 1920.\\"Daniel C. French Resigns.\\" New York Times.

Spanning approximately along a north-south axis, it links the cities of Providence, Woonsocket, and Worcester, Massachusetts. The southern terminus of Route 146 is located at Interstate 95 (I-95) in Providence. The majority of the route is a controlled-access highway, with the exception of at-grade crossings and driveway access in the towns of North Smithfield and Lincoln. The northern terminus is located at the Rhode Island-Massachusetts border in Millville, where it transitions into Massachusetts Route 146 and continues northbound towards the Massachusetts Turnpike in Millbury and I-290 in Worcester. Route description Route 146 begins in downtown Providence at I-95 northbound Exit 23 (there is no direct access from I-95 southbound, Exit 23 access to Route 146 is via surface streets). Locally it is known as Old Louisquisset Pike, and is a narrow 4-lane freeway with no shoulders and a simple Jersey barrier median separating oncoming traffic. The first two interchanges are partial access only, with Rhode Island Route 7 (Douglas Avenue) and Rhode Island Route 246 (Charles Street) and provide access between Route 146 and I-95 via surface streets for where there is no direct access (southbound I-95 to northbound 146, and southbound 146 to northbound I-95). The first complete interchange is a diamond interchange with Branch Avenue, followed by a partial interchange with Rhode Island Route 15 (no northbound entrance to Route 146). The next interchange, with Route 246 a second time, provides the access missing from the Route 15 interchange. At this point, now in North Providence the \\"Old Louisquisset Pike\\" designation leaves to follow Route 246, and the 146 freeway becomes the Eddie Dowling Highway. Near the southern boundary of Lincoln, there is a southbound-only offramp (no other access) with Route 246, while the northbound side abuts Olney Pond in the Lincoln Woods State Park. Two partial cloverleaf interchanges follow with Twin River Road and Rhode Island Route 123/Breakneck Hill Road. The next interchange northbound is a right-in/right- out terminus of Sherman Avenue, while southbound has access to 246 here. A single onramp provides Wilbur Avenue an entrance to northbound 146 next, then a modified cloverleaf interchange with Rhode Island Route 116, followed shortly by a full cloverleaf interchange with I-295 and the southern terminus of Rhode Island Route 99, which is a short connector freeway to the city of Woonsocket Route 99 access is a northbound exit/southbound entrance only, the other directions need to use surface streets for access. North of this interchange, the road turns into a divided boulevard with at-grade crossings and driveway access through the southern part of the town of North Smithfield, Rhode Island. A stoplight marks the only major intersection, an at-grade crossing with Sayles Hill Road, which doubles back and has a right in/right out interchange with southbound 146. At the partial interchange with Rhode Island Route 146A (northbound exit and southbound entrance) the freeway resumes, now called the North Smithfield Expressway, which has three interchanges in the town: Rhode Island Route 104, Pound Hill Road, and a complex interchange with School Street and 146A that also provides access to Rhode Island Route 5 and Rhode Island Route 102. Approximately two miles north of this interchange, the freeway continues into Massachusetts as Massachusetts Route 146, the Worcester/Providence Pike. History Prior to the construction of the two freeway sections, Route 146 used present-day Route 246 and Route 146A. The only part of the original alignment still in use is the non-freeway section between Interstate 295/Route 99 and Route 146A in the southern part of North Smithfield. In May 2019, Route 146 received mile-based exit numbers. Previously, the exits were unnumbered. Future In May 2019, the Rhode Island Senate announced that the state would borrow $200 million to reconfigure I-95 through Downtown Providence, near the southern terminus of Route 146. The replacement of the Providence Viaduct with twin bridges is intended to alleviate the bottleneck created by traffic entering I-95 from the US 6 and RI 10, and exiting towards RI 146 and US 44. The project is expected to cost $250 million. RIDOT plans to build two toll gantries, one in Lincoln and one in North Smithfield, for truck-only electronic toll collection. Exit list Exits were unnumbered until Summer 2019, when RIDOT began adding mileage-based exit numbers to conform to federal highway standards. The project is expected to be completed by 2021. Suffixed route Route 146A is a numbered state highway running in Rhode Island. It was designated as Route 146 before the construction of the North Smithfield Expressway. The road follows a former stagecoach path through historic Union Village in North Smithfield. This road was known as \\"the Great Road\\". The northern end of the road crosses the state line near Buxton Street at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. This section was known as Ironstone, after good quality bog iron ore found near here. It takes the following route through the state: *North Smithfield: ; Route 146 to Massachusetts state line at Route 146A **Eddie Dowling Highway, Smithfield Road, Great Road, Victory Highway, North Main Street and Quaker Highway Major intersections See also * ReferencesExternal links *2019 Highway Map, Rhode Island 146 Category:Transportation in Providence County, Rhode Island ","title":"Rhode Island Route 146"},{"id":"2279892","text":"Wirth's law is an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster. The adage is named after Niklaus Wirth, who discussed it in his 1995 article \\"A Plea for Lean Software\\".  History  Wirth attributed the saying to Martin Reiser, who in the preface to his book on the Oberon System wrote: \\"The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness.\\" Other observers had noted this for some time before; indeed, the trend was becoming obvious as early as 1987. He states two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software as: \\"rapidly growing hardware performance\\" and \\"customers' ignorance of features that are essential versus nice-to-have\\". Enhanced user convenience and functionality supposedly justify the increased size of software, but Wirth argues that people are increasingly misinterpreting complexity as sophistication, that \\"these details are cute but not essential, and they have a hidden cost\\". As a result, he calls for the creation of \\"leaner\\" software and pioneered the development of Oberon, a software system developed between 1986 and 1989 based on nothing but hardware. Its primary goal was to show that software can be developed with a fraction of the memory capacity and processor power usually required, without sacrificing flexibility, functionality, or user convenience.  Other names  The law was restated in 2009 and attributed to Larry Page, founder of Google. It has been referred to as Page's law. The first use of that name is attributed to Sergey Brin at the 2009 Google I/O Conference. Other common forms use the names of the leading hardware and software companies of the 1990s (Intel & Microsoft), or their CEOs (Andy Grove & Bill Gates): \\"What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away\\" and \\"What Andy giveth, Bill taketh away\\". Gates's law (\\"The speed of software halves every 18 months\\"Gates' law, from the Jargon Lexicon, in the Jargon File (version 4.4.7).) is a variant on Wirth's law, borrowing its name from Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft. It is an observation that the speed of commercial software generally slows by 50% every 18 months, thereby negating all the benefits of Moore's law. This could occur for a variety of reasons: \\"featuritis\\", \\"code cruft\\", developer laziness, or a management turnover whose design philosophy does not coincide with the previous manager.Orion, Egan (March 21, 2003). \\"WinTel trips on Linux?\\", The Inquirer.

It was a formally described district in French Sudan, but in 1895, the border between Sudan and Senegal was moved to the Faleme River, placing the western portion of the district within Senegal. The term is still used to designate the region, but there is no formal administrative area with that name. According to Martin Meredith, the Carthaginians used Berber nomads to establish a packhorse trade route across the Sahara between Lixus and \\"the goldfields of Bambuk in the Senegal River valley.\\" Arab geographers referred to Bambouk, Bour√©, Lobi and Ashante gold fields as Wangara. The Portuguese reached Bambouk in 1550, but were killed off, either by each other or by the locals. The French built Fort Saint Pierre on the Fal√©m√© in 1714, and two trading posts in Bambouk in 1724. The trading posts were abandoned in 1732 and the fort in 1759. Another French post was established in 1824, but abandoned in 1841. Today, Bambouk lies with the K√©ni√©ba Cercle. According to Levtzion there were, \\"...three principal goldfields, besides others of lesser importance: Bambuk, between the Senegal and the Faleme rivers; Bure on the Upper Niger; and the Akan goldfields near the forest of the present republics of Ghana and the Ivory Coast.\\" He further states it may have been the \\"island of gold or Wangara...where alluvial gold was collected.\\" \\"Wasteful methods reduced the productivity of the goldfields...in the eleventh or twelfth century, the Sudanese traders ventured southwards and opened up the new goldfields of Bure on the Upper Niger, in the region of Siguiri.\\" The Diakhanke established Diakha-ba and became Muslim clerics for the Malinke chiefs after Bambuk was conquered by the Mali Empire in the thirteenth century. According to Levtzion, \\"From their centre in Bambuk, the Diakhanke spread to Bondu, Kedougou, and Futa Djallon and established new communities such as Niokhol and Dantilia - in order to secure a monopoly over the trade with the Europeans.\\" The area was renowned as a major centre for gold mining from the 12th until the 19th century, and some gold mining still takes place on the Malian side of the border. It served as the home of the Khasso kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries before becoming a part of French Sudan.

This concept has also been called sound mind and memory or disposing mind and memory. Presumption of capacity Adults are presumed to have the ability to make a will. Litigation about testamentary capacity typically revolves around charges that the testator, by virtue of senility, dementia, insanity, or other unsoundness of mind, lacked the mental capacity to make a will. In essence, the doctrine requires those who would challenge a validly executed will to demonstrate that the testator did not know the consequence of his or her conduct when he or she executed the will. Certain people, such as minors, are usually deemed to be conclusively incapable of making a will by the common law; however, minors who serve in the military are conceded the right to make a will by statute in many jurisdictions. In South Africa, however, one acquires testamentary capacity at the age of 16 years. Requirements The requirements for testamentary capacity are minimal. Some courts have held that a person who lacked the capacity to make a contract can nevertheless make a valid will. While the wording of statutes or judicial rulings will vary from one jurisdiction to another, the test generally requires that the testator was aware of: # The extent and value of their property. # The persons who are the natural beneficiaries # The disposition he is making # How these elements relate to form an orderly plan of distribution of property.Jesse Dukeminier & Stanley M. Johanson, Wills, Trusts & Estates, Sixth Edition, Aspen Publishers, 2005\\"Sound Mind and Memory - What Does this Phrase Mean?\\" from The Calhoun County, Michigan state government website .

Retrieved September 18, 2008. Legal help mate website . Retrieved September 18, 2008. The legal test implies that a typical claimant in a will contest is a disgruntled heir who believes he or she should have received a larger share than they did under the will. Once the challenging party meets the burden of proof that the testator did not possess the capacity, the burden subsequently shifts to the party propounding the will to show by clear and convincing evidence that the testator did have the requisite capacity. Proof of testamentary capacity Those who contest a will for lack of testamentary capacity must typically show that the decedent suffered from mental unsoundness that left them unable to remember family members or caused them to hold insane delusions about them.Addington v. Wilson, 5 Blackf. (Ind.) 137, 61 Am.Dec. 81 (Sup. Ct. Ind. 1854) Dead Man's Statutes sometimes restrict evidence which can be admitted concerning transactions with the decedent. Hays v. Harmon, 809 N.E.2d 460 (Ind. Ct. App., 2004) The best known or most authoritative text on the common law test for capacity is the judgment of Martin Nourse QC (who was then sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court and later became a Lord Justice of Appeal)in Re Beaney, deceased [1978] 2 All ER 595, 601, WLR 770. When someone gives away a substantial proportion of their assets, the general rule is that they must have the same degree of capacity as is required for a will. \\"The degree or extent of understanding required in respect of any instrument is relative to the particular transaction which it is to effect. In the case of a will the degree required is always high. In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift inter vivos, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction. Thus, at one extreme, if the subject-matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor's other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other, if its effect is to dispose of the donor's only asset of value and thus for practical purposes to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor must understand the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.\\" Lawyers for people whose testamentary capacity might be called into question often arrange for a will execution to be video taped. On video, they ask the testator about his property and about his family, and go over the contents of the testator's will. Along with resolving an examinee's testamentary capacity, a forensic specialist observes for signs of undue influence by a concerned party that exploits an emotionally vulnerable individual who might otherwise be cognitively intact. The testamentary capacity matter is most frequently raised posthumously, when an aggrieved heir contests the will entered into probate. For this reason, the forensic psychiatrist or forensic psychologist studies the testatrix‚Äô cognition through videotape record of the drafting of the will, or by reviewing email, letters and other records. Even when a testator are found to have lacked testamentary capacity due to senility, loss of memory due to the aging process, infirmity or insanity, courts will sometimes rule that the testator had a \\"temporary period of lucidity\\" or a \\"lucid moment\\" at the time of the execution of the testamentary instrument. Such finding will validate a will that would otherwise be denied probate. A way to forestall a will contest would be to have a self-proving will, in which an affidavit of the witnesses to the will specifically swear or affirm that the will was prepared under the supervision of an attorney. =Testamentary capacity in England and Wales= The presumption of capacity Where a will is rational, professionally drawn, seemingly regular in form and is made by a person whose capacity is not in doubt, there is a presumption that the will is valid. This presumption can be rebutted by a challenger to the will showing that there is a real doubt about capacity. At this point the burden of proving capacity moves to the propounder of the will to then show that there was testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed.[7] Testamentary capacity Testamentary capacity is the mental capacity required to make a valid will. The current test comes from the decision in Banks v Goodfellow (1870).[8] This case concerned the validity of the will of John Banks. In modern terms he would most likely be described as a paranoid schizophrenic. He suffered from delusions that he was being persecuted by devils (they were sometimes visible to him) and also by a deceased local grocer. His will was challenged on the basis that he was insane and therefore unable to make a will.[9] The will was found to be valid after trial by jury, before Brett J, at Cumberland Spring Assizes in 1869. On appeal, this judgment was confirmed unanimously by a panel of four appeal judges in Queen's Bench. The will was found to be valid, not influenced by his delusions, and deemed rational, being in favour of his only close relative (who also lived with him). In a strong and eloquent judgment, Cockburn CJ set out the following test of the capacity to make a valid will, which still applied in many Anglophone jurisdictions today: ‚ÄúIt is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties‚Äîthat no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.‚Äù [10] This remains the test today, notwithstanding the Mental Capacity Act 2005.[11] It is now considered as being composed of four distinct elements and that understanding is required of [1] the nature of the act of making a will and its effect [2] the extent of the property that is to be disposed of [3] the claims of family or friendship to which he ought to give effect and as a separate element[12] [4] that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties‚Äîthat no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made. In addition, the original wording, [1], [2] and [3] are all approached as not requiring actual understanding, but instead being capable of understanding .[13] As this is a common law test created by judges, it is capable of being modified by judges, as they see fit in the light of modern circumstances. Modern psychiatric knowledge has allowed the test to be developed by having a further element added and that is for the testator to be capable of exercising his decision-making powers.[14] This test is focussed on the ability of the particular individual and his particular estate. The outcome is always unique to the particular facts. Where the circumstances and assets of a testator are simple or straightforward the level of capacity required will be lower than that for the testator with complex circumstances and assets.[15] A court administered test The test in Banks v Goodfellow has proved to be long lasting as it was not a definition in medical terms, but a plain English definition of what a person should be capable of understanding in order to make a will. The test is still applied by a court. A medical opinion, while being potentially valuable evidence, is not determinative of capacity unless accepted as such by the court.[16] The evidence of the will draftsman has considerable value to the court,[17] if he has carried out his work to an acceptable standard.[18] The test for wills distinguished from other tests of capacity The test in Banks v Goodfellow is expressly designed for the capability of a person to make a will. It is not therefore a test that has an application to any other transactions, save one ‚Äì the capacity to make substantial lifetime gifts. The leading English decision in this area is Re Beaney (deceased)[19] where it was said: ‚ÄúIn the circumstances, it seems to me that the law is this. The degree or extent of understanding required in respect of any instrument is relative to the particular transaction which it is to effect.[20] In the case of a will the degree required is always high. In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift inter vivos, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction. Thus, at one extreme, if the subject matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor‚Äôs other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other extreme, if its effect is to dispose of the donor‚Äôs only asset of value and thus, for practical purposes, to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor understands the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.‚Äù The test in a modern context The increasing longevity of individuals means that there is a greater chance of any person losing the capacity to make a will in their old age as a result of dementia. Indeed, dementia is the commonest reason for a will to be challenged, although any mental disorder may cause loss of capacity. This presents a major issue for the will draftsman who is not only required to have a knowledge of the legal test of capacity, but also of what its implications are, in order to record his relevant observations of the testator and form an opinion of his client's capacity. This, coupled with much greater prominence of negligence claims against will draftsmen,[21] means that a careful understanding of what the draftsman should be doing becomes vital.

Life He was born at Saint- Flour, Cantal, and was educated by his uncle, a distinguished advocate in Paris, for the bar. To escape from a profession he disliked he joined a troupe of comedians playing in the courts of the northern sovereigns. In 1758 the performance of his Titus, which had already been produced in Saint Petersburg, was postponed through his uncle's exertions; and when it did appear, a hostile cabal procured its failure, and it was not until after his guardians death that de Belloy returned to Paris with Zelmire (1762), a fantastic drama which met with great success, latter becoming an opera by Rossini. This was followed in 1765 by the patriotic play, Le Si√®ge de Calais. The humiliations undergone by France in the Seven Years' War assured a good reception for a play in which the devotion of Frenchmen redeemed disaster. The popular enthusiasm was unaffected by the judgment of calmer critics such as Diderot and Voltaire, who pointed out that the glorification of France was not best effected by a picture of defeat. De Belloy was admitted to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1772 due to his activities as a playwright. He remains the only actor to have ever held a seat on the Academy. His attempt to introduce national subjects into French drama deserves honor, but it must be confessed that his resources proved unequal to the task. The Le Si√®ge de Calais was followed by Gabrielle de Vergy (1770), Gaston di Bayard (1771), Pedro le cruel (1772). None of these attained the success of the earlier play, and de Belloy's death, which took place on 5 March 1775, is said to have been hastened by disappointment.

From a purely technical perspective, it is very closely related to its parent art, Traditional Hapkido, though it places more emphasis on meditative, philosophical, and Ki development training. Hapkido is often translated as ‚Äúthe way of coordinating power,‚Äù which places emphasis on the physical techniques that Hapkido is often known for. However, the founder of Sin Moo Hapkido, Ji Han-Jae, has landed on a different understanding of the term. Hap means bringing together, gathering, or harmonizing. ‚ÄúKi‚Äù is the energy or breath in the body that connects the mind and the body, and \\"Do\\" is the process or way this happens. Thus, his definition of Hapkido is, ‚ÄúThe way of harmonizing the mind and body through the utilization of ki.‚Äù Sin means \\"higher mind or higher spirit,\\" and \\"Moo\\" means \\"martial art.\\" When translated in its entirety, Sin Moo Hapkido therefore means, ‚ÄúThe way of using martial arts to harmonize the mind and body to reach a higher more enlightened state of existence.‚Äù History Sin Moo Hapkido was founded in 1983 in Seoul, South Korea by Dojunim Ji Han-Jae (b. 1936) with the assistance of Merrill Jung and other members of the Northern California Hapkido Association. The curriculum was based on Ji's earlier Hapkido programs that he developed from his three teachers and own personal study. Ji, Han Jae was an early student (Dan #14) of Choi Yong-Sool, a student of Yawara & Daito-Ryu Aikijujutsu, and the founder of Hapkiyusool, a forerunner of Hapkido. DoJuNim Ji, Han Jae also a student of the teacher known only as Master / Wise-Man Lee (Lee Do-Sa), who taught \\"Sam Rang Do\\", weapons, and more, as well as \\"Grandma\\", who he considered to be his spiritual teacher. Though formed in Seoul, the first official school for Sin Moo Hapkido was not opened until 1984 in Daly City (very near San Francisco), California, where Ji began teaching his new art. The art Sin Moo Hapkido incorporates a philosophy of non-violence, self-improvement, adaptability, and physical, emotional and spiritual balance, with the basic Hapkido training. Additionally, Sin Moo Hapkido formalizes a series of techniques, although at advanced levels students are expected to synthesize their own work. The use of energy flows are also emphasized in Sin Moo Hapkido. Techniques Sin Moo Hapkido uses holds, joint locks, throws, re-direction, kicks, punches, blocks, pressure points, weapons, and energy flow techniques. =Holds and Joint Locks= Holds and joint locks are used primarily for control of an aggressor. They are primarily defensive, but at more advanced levels can be interpreted as attacks. At the 4th dan black belt there is also taught 30 special attack techniques using variations and combinations of basic locks. =Throws, Re- Direction and Blocks= Throws and re-direction of an aggressor's energy use an attacker's momentum to continue their own motion using the circular motion principle (Won) of Hapkido. These techniques depend on the incoming energy of the attack to determine their outcome; a soft or weak attack will require a small or soft re-direction. A large or powerful attack will result in a re- direction or throw that involves much more energy, translating to a more devastating outcome upon the attacker. The blocks used in Sin Moo Hapkido are usually also re-direction blocks, but some blocks are intended to be used to stop an aggressor's attack and because of this some blocks are hard blocks. Also legs are used for blocking. =Kicks and Punches= Sin Moo Hapkido uses a wide variety of strikes. Sin Moo Hapkido incorporates 25 defensive kicks that are useful in \\"street style\\" defensive situations that counter incoming attacks ‚Äì out of the 25 two are specially only used to block kicks, but some of the other kicks can be used the same way also. Many of the kicks are designed for use in restricted spaces like hallways or crowds. After learning the basic 25 the student then learns 7 spin kicks, followed by many special kicks. Special kicks are harder to master but they need more room to be used, and they include doublekicks, flyingkicks, from the ground done kicks, jumpingkicks and combination kicks. Sin Moo Hapkido has numerous striking techniques. =Pressure Points and Energy Flow= Pressure points are used in Hapkido to control the physical body, and to manipulate the body's Ki to stop, disarm and disable an attacker or heal a patient. Sin Moo Hapkido uses many pressure points out of the body's over 750 pressure points. The pressure points are also referred to as vital points. Sin Moo Hapkido has a special side called Revival Techniques, which specializes on pressure point fighting and eastern medicine. =Weapons= Sin Moo Hapkido weapon training consists of the use of short stick (tan bong), long stick (jang bong), the sword (kum), cane, handkerchief, long-belt/scarf, thrown weapons (knives, rocks, etc...) and adapting everyday objects to use as weapons. Weapon training is learned in the black belt stages, but knife defense techniques are learned at Brown Belt. Ranks Sin Moo Hapkido's ranking system is somewhat similar to other ranking systems. Gups (Í∏â, called also kups) are beginner student stages and dans (Îã®) are advanced student stages. Though Sin Moo Hapkido has had a number of different revisions as far as rank structure, this is the current organization used by Ji, Han Jae. . Lately, Dojunim Ji, Han Jae himself has associated official titles to Dan ranks, adding 10th Dan. He has asked all his top students (8th and 9th Dans) to help the \\"10th Dans\\" in their task of expanding and developing Sin Moo Hapkido. Belt Ranks: * White Belt *Yellow Belt * Green Belt * Blue Belt * Red Belt * Brown Belt Black Belts: * 1st Dan: Black Belt * 2nd Dan: Assistant * 3rd Dan: Assistant Instructor * 4th Dan: Instructor * 5th Dan: Master * 6th Dan: Chief Master (Cheul Do In) * 7th Dan: Head Master (Joong Cheul Do In) * 8th Dan: Senior Master (Sang Cheul Sun Sa) * 9th Dan: Senior Grandmaster (Dae Cheul Sun In) * 10th Dan: Supreme Grandmaster (Joong Kwang Sun Sa) * Beyond Dan ranks : \\"Dojunim: Ji, Han Jae (Honorable Founder Of The Way) Uniform There are many variations when it comes to uniforms in Sin Moo Hapkido as there was no official uniform for many years. Although a diamond pattern on the dobok top is a Hapkido designation most European schools used white uniforms with black trim, and most American schools used plain white judo uniforms for the first 15 years or so. The current official uniform is a grey colored dobok often with ties at the bottoms (for leg weights), though many people chose to leave the legs open. There is a World Sin Moo Hapkido logo on the left lapel and an oval shaped Sin Moo Hapkido logo on the back. The official uniform (dobok) for \\"Masters\\" rank and above, 6th Dan and higher, is white with gold trim as seen in Bruce Lee's \\"Game of Death\\" movie. Meditation and Ki Breathing Sin Moo Hapkido has many meditation techniques. They are a combination of Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist exercises and primarily focus on Ki development and opening the \\"mind's eye.\\" Sin Moo Hapkido's first exercise is known as Danjeon Breathing and is similar to Chinese Qigong practices. Sin Moo Hapkido classes usually start with danjeon breathing and end with meditation. Nine basic life rules Sin Moo Hapkido's basic rules are categorized into three groups to make a total of 9 rules. The first three are associated with Confucianism. The second are related to Buddhism. The last three rules are related to Seon Buddhism and Taoism. These rules will help the Sin Moo Hapkido practitioner to have a better and healthier life.

This way, Sin Moo Hapkido can grow much richer year after year, thanks to all these top ranking Masters teaching their techniques all over the world. Here is a list of the Kwans that currently exist within the Sin Moo Hapkido family : * Shin Yong Do (Frank Croaro) * Yu Shin HapGi Mu yae Kwan (Ian Cyrus) * Samil Kwan (Sean Bradley) * Satory Do Kwan (Massan Ghorbani) * Yu Sool Kwan (John Beluschak) * Song Moo Kwan (Geoff Booth) * Han Do Kwan (Herman Mochalin) * Jeong Hak Kwan (Nicolas Tacchi) * Sun Bi Kwan (In Wan Kim) * Tang Soo Kwan (John Godwin) * Anu Kwan (Stuart Rosenberg) * Bi Ho Kwan (Larry Dorsey) * SinMoo Jung Shin Kwan (Ramfis Marquez) *SinMoo Sung Hwa Do (Kirk Koskella) Kwans and regions are independent and they are fully authorized to issue Dan certificates. Although, the caveat is that all kwans and regions work together to preserve the legacy of Sin Moo Hapkido and Sin Moo. However, many of them continue to work together by attending special events such as World Sin Moo Hapkido Federation's \\"International Hapkido Summit\\", hosted by \\"Joong Kwang Dae Sun Sa\\" Ken MacKenzie. Many Grandmasters like GM John Godwin (Tang Soo Kwan), GM Inwan Kim (Sun Bi Kwan), GM Larry Dorsey (Bi Ho Kwan) and GM Massan Ghorbani (Satory Do Kwan) regularly attend this cooperation event. Plus, many European Sin Moo Grandmasters like GM Rami Vainionpaa (head of Skandinavian Sin Moo Hapkido), GM Nicolas Tacchi (Jeong Hak Kwan, head of French-speaking Sin Moo Hapkido), GM Rafael Balbastre (head of Hispanic Sin Moo Hapkido) and GM Herman Mochalin (Han Do Kwan) still consider \\"Joong Kwang Dae Sun Sa\\" J√ºrg Ziegler as their Sin Moo teacher and attend his European seminars. In addition, other Sin Moo Grandmasters such as Frank Croaro (First Generation- Senior Student), Farshad Azad, John Beluschak, Stuart Rosenberg, Sean Bradley, Ian A. Cyrus, and Ramfis Marquez, & Scott Yates continue to preserve the legacy of Sin Moo Hapkido for future generations.

While a varied selection of grape varieties, there is an emphasis on cold hardy varieties, but also Vitis vinifera varieties, such as Chardonnay, Gew√ºrztraminer and Riesling. Among the cultivated hybrids are Aurore, Seyval, Vidal blanc, Vignoles and Marechal Foch.

The lyrics describe the allure of a mysterious private club with a green door, behind which \\"a happy crowd\\" play piano, smoke and \\"laugh a lot\\", and inside which the singer is not allowed. \\"Green Door\\" was backed by the orchestra of songwriter Davie, with Davie also playing piano, and by the vocal group the High Fives. The track was arranged by Davie, who added thumbtacks to the hammers of his piano and sped up the tape to give a honky- tonk sound. Released by Dot Records, the single reached #1 on the Billboard charts for one week on November 17, 1956, replacing \\"Love Me Tender\\" by Elvis Presley. Outside the US, Lowe's version reached #8 on the charts, in the United Kingdom. Lyrics The singer cannot get any sleep each evening, due to the sound of the music coming from the club. He tries to go there by knocking once on the green door, trying to tell the person behind the door that he had been there before, only to have the door slammed immediately (\\"hospitality's thin there\\"). Then, through the keyhole, he tries to say the possible secret password \\"Joe sent me\\" (the password for Hernando's Hideaway), which only results in laughter as he is again rejected admittance into the private club. =Possible inspirations= This song was written by Marvin Moore describing a place in Dallas, Texas, where he and Charlie Boland, a sports announcer, climbed a stairway to a green door where a piano played in the background and a man with a huge cigar kept people out unless they had a card of membership in one of the performing arts or unions. In a copy of the original lyrics he actually began using Dallas in the lyric. A copy of said original lyrics, along with an original letter in 1966 from Marvin Moore to Charlie Boland‚Äôs daughter explains this to her after she sang the song to Marvin Moore one night over the phone at the age of 9. After the Great Chicago Fire, a tavern opened in Chicago, the Green Door Tavern. During prohibition, this was a popular place to get secret libations. As the door of the tavern is green, the color became a symbol of a speakeasy. During the Prohibition Era many restaurants would paint their doors green to indicate the presence of a speakeasy. One suggestion of the song's origins is that it was inspired by an afterhours club in Dallas, Texas, to which lyricist Moore had been refused entry because he did not know the correct password.Michael Jack Kirby, \\"Jim Lowe: The Green Door\\", Way Back Attack. Retrieved 13 December 2016 At the time of the song's initial popularity in the 1950s, many believed it was inspired by a green-doored restaurant and bar called \\"The Shack\\" in Columbia, Missouri, where singer Jim Lowe had attended the University of Missouri. However long- time Shack owner Joe Franke doubts this theory.Adam Daniels, \\"The Shack comes back\\" , The Columbia Missourian, 9 August 2007.\\" An oft-repeated urban legend has developed saying the song refers to London's first lesbian club, Gateways (1930‚Äì1985), which was in Bramerton Street in Chelsea. It had a green door and was featured in the film The Killing of Sister George. But aside from that there is no substantive connection between the 1950s American song and the British club. In \\"The Green Door\\", a short story by O. Henry from his 1906 book The Four Million, a man named Rudolf Steiner is handed a mysterious card reading, \\"The Green Door.\\" On entering the door he meets a starving young woman. He quickly rushes out and returns laden with food, and they become friends over supper; finally Steiner promises to visit her again the next day and there is romance in the offing. Eventually it turns out that the card was an advertisement for an entirely different \\"Green Door\\", a theatre play. O. Henry uses the eponymous green door as a symbol for everyday adventures which he encourages us to seek out. It is also possible that the song is a reference to an H. G. Wells short story, \\"The Door in the Wall.\\"H.G. Wells (1911) The Door in the Wall and Other Stories Behind the Green Door (1940) is a Penny Parker mystery novel by Mildred Wirt Benson. In the novel, the secret door hides some illegal activity at a ski-resort hotel; no music or vice is involved in this book aimed at adolescent girls. It was reprinted in 1951, a few years before the song appeared. Fitz-James O'Brien's short story, \\"The Lost Room\\", details a man being locked out of his own room by a group of demons and bears some similarity to the themes of the song.

He arguably became most notable for his command, along with the Austro-Hungarian commander Svetozar Borojeviƒá, during the victorious Battle of Caporetto in October-November 1917. Pre-war Von Below was born in Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk). Before the war broke out, he was promoted Generalmajor in 1909 and Generalleutnant in 1912. He was commanding 2nd Infantry Division immediately prior to the outbreak of war. First World War=Eastern Front= On 1 August 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, Below was given command of I Reserve Corps as part of 8th Army on the Eastern Front. He led his Corps in the Battles of Gumbinnen, Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. As a result of his successes, he was promoted to General der Infanterie at the end of August 1914 and to command of 8th Army at the beginning of November. Below commanded the 8th Army in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes (February 1915) and the Army of the Niemen (later renamed 8th Army) in the Courland Offensive (May 1915). His forces advanced into Courland and Lithuania as far as the southern reaches of the Western Dvina River. =Macedonia= In October 1916, Below was appointed to the command of Heeresgruppe BelowHeeresgruppe or Army Group in the sense of a number of armies under a single commander. on the Macedonian Front, consisting of the German 11th Army and the First and Second Bulgarian Armies. In April 1917, he was briefly sent to the Western Front to command 6th Army around Lille. =Italy= Below next served on the Italian Front from September 1917. Commanding the Austro-German 14th Army (seven German and 10 Austro-Hungarian divisions) in the Battle of Caporetto, his units were able to break into the Italian front line and rout the Italian army, which had practically no mobile reserves. The battle was a demonstration of the effectiveness of the use of stormtroopers and the infiltration tactics developed in part by Oskar von Hutier. The use of poison gas by the Germans played a key role in the collapse of the Italian Second Army. A breakdown in German logistics brought the battle to a close on the line of the Piave River and the front soon froze again in trench warfare. =Western Front= In February 1918, Below was brought back to the Western Front to command the newly formed 17th Army for the Kaiserschlacht Offensive. Below was expected to overrun Arras during March 1918 in a repeat of Caporetto; his inability to do so led to the failure of the German campaign to capture the Somme that same month. Attacking the stronger, better prepared British Third Army, he had less success than forces further south facing the British Fifth Army. In January 1918 he made the following revolutionary proposal to Ludendorff: \\"Forget about the offensive and shorten the front lines as much as necessary; build Panzers throughout all of 1918 and, with your Panzer squadrons, break through all the way to the Channel coast in the Spring of 1919\\". Below briefly commanded the 1st Army. Shortly before the war's end, Below was involved in preparations for a possible final battle on German territory (Home Defense Forces West). Awards Below was awarded the Pour le M√©rite on 16 February 1915 \\"for outstanding leadership and distinguished military planning and successful operations\\", and the Oakleaves (signifying a second award) on 27 April 1917. In addition to the Pour le M√©rite, Below was also awarded the Order of the Black Eagle on 1 November 1917 and the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class. Post-war Below retired in 1919. A post-war attempt by the Allies to try him as a war criminal failed. Otto von Below died on 9 March 1944 in Friedland, Lower Saxony. Family Below was the cousin of Fritz von Below, another German commander during the war. The two Generals are often confused.

She was a noted mystic of her era. A member of the Order of the Immaculate Conception, also known as Conceptionists, Mary of Jesus wrote 14 books, including a series of revelations about the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Her bilocation activity is said to have occurred between her cloistered monastery in rural Spain and the Jumano Indians of central New Mexico and West Texas, and inspired many Franciscan missionaries in the New World. In popular culture since the 17th century, she has been dubbed the Lady in Blue and the Blue Nun, after the color of her order's habit. Life=Early life= She was born Mar√≠a Coronel y de Arana', the daughter of Francisco Coronel, a converso of Jewish descent , and Catalina de Arana, in √Ågreda, a town located in the Province of Soria. The couple had 11 children, of whom only four survived into adulthood: Francisco, Jos√©, Mar√≠a and Jer√≥nima. Maria later described her mother as the more lively of the two, though both were very fervent in their faith. The family had close ties with the Franciscan friars of the Friary of San Juli√°n, which lay on the outskirts of the town. Either the mother would go to the friary with her children for Mass and confession, or the friars would visit the family home. Nonetheless, Mary later recalled that, as a very young child, she felt her parents were very hard on her. Mary of Jesus' biographer and contemporary, the bishop Jos√© Jim√©nez y Samaniego, was a longtime friend of the Coronel family, and testified that even as a young girl Mary was filled with divine knowledge. From her early years, he wrote, she had ecstasies and visions in which she felt that God was instructing her about the sinfulness of the world, a conviction which would last throughout her life.Xim√©nez Samaniego, Jos√©. Life of Venerable Sister, Mary of Jes√∫s‚ÄîD. √Ågreda: Poor Clare Nun, Translated by Ubaldus da Rieti (Keller-Crescent Printing and Engraving, 1910) At the age of four, she was confirmed by Diego de Yepes, a bishop and the biographer and last confessor of Teresa of Avila, who was reportedly impressed with the child's spiritual acumen.Pe√±a Garc√≠a, Manuel. Sor Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda (El Burgo de Osma, 1997) It was at this point in her life that she felt a growing warmth in her parents' attitudes toward her. When Mary of Jesus was twelve, she made the decision to enter a monastery, having decided upon that of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Tarazona. As her parents prepared to accompany her there, Catalina de Arana had a vision that she was to turn the family home into a monastery in which both she and her daughters were to commit their lives as nuns. While the young Mar√≠a was agreeable to this arrangement, her father refused to go along with it. In this he was supported by his brother, Medel, as well as by their neighbors, who all considered this arrangement a violation of their marriage vows. His resistance lasted for three years, until in 1618, then considered an older man in his early fifties, he (and later his brother) entered the Franciscan Friary of San Antonio in Nalda as a lay brother. Her brothers, who had already become friars, continued their studies toward the Catholic priesthood in Burgos. Mary of Jesus later recalled that this period had been one of severe trial for her spiritual life and had led to a certain sense of vanity. =Monastic life= A view of the Monastery of the Immaculate Conception founded by the Venerable Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda with a statue of her in front Catalina and her daughters then converted their family home into the Monastery of the Immaculate Conception, to be a part of the Order of the Immaculate Conception. The choice of this Order was a part of the huge devotion to the Immaculate Conception of Mary which marked Spanish spirituality of that period. They began this endeavor as part of the Discalced‚Äîor reformed‚Äîbranch of the Order. Unfortunately, there were no monasteries of this branch in the region, so three nuns of the original Calced branch were brought from their monastery in Burgos to serve as the abbess of the community and to train them in the life of the Order. Mary of Jesus later judged that this had given a bad start to the enterprise, as these nuns were to teach them a way of life they had neither known nor practiced. Mary of Jesus was 16 when she and her mother and sister took the religious habit of the Order and she was given the religious name by which she is now known. She felt, though, that she had to make up for her years of laxity during the period of contention between her parents and the delay in the foundation of the monastery resulting from it. As other women soon joined the community, the monastery was rebuilt (and completed in 1633), although when reconstruction began the community's coffers contained 24 reales (approximately 2.5 Spanish dollars at the time), supplemented by a donation of 100 reales from devotees and many other gifts and hours of voluntary labor. Once she had made her religious profession in 1620, Mary of Jesus began to experience a long period of illness and temptations. After her mother's death, Mary of Jesus, then aged 25, was appointed the Superior locum tenens, after which her fellow nuns elected her as their abbess. Though rules required the abbess to be changed every three years, Mary remained effectively in charge of the monastery until her death, except for a three-year sabbatical in her fifties. Throughout her life, Mary of Jesus was inclined to the \\"internal prayer\\" or \\"quiet prayer\\". Like her countrywoman Teresa of Avila a generation earlier, these prayerful experiences led to religious ecstasies, including reported accounts of levitation. As this form of prayer was practiced frequently among women, the Inquisition kept a watchful eye on those who advocated the practice. Written works The title page of the Mistica Ciudad de Dios, Vida de la Virgen Mar√≠a, a work written by the Venerable Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda and published in 1722 Mar√≠a de √Ågreda's best known single work is the Mystical City of God (Spanish: Mistica Ciudad de Dios, Vida de la Virgen Mar√≠a), consisting of eight books (six volumes). This related her revelations about the terrestrial and heavenly life, received directly from (dictated by) the Blessed Virgin Mary. The books include information about the relationship of the 'Blessed Virgin' with the Triune God, as well as the doings and Mysteries performed by Jesus as God-Man in flesh and in Spirit. The narrative contains extensive details and covers the New Testament time line. It also relates advice given by the Holy Mother on how to acquire true sanctity.(Impresion from original 17th Century autograph): SOR MARIA DE JESUS DE AGREDA, MISTICA CIUDAD DE DIOS, VIDA DE MARIA, Texto conforme al aut√≥grafo original, Impresi√≥n: Mexico D.F 1984 The Mystical City of God, the biography of Mary, is now frequently studied in college and university programs of Spanish language and culture, for its contribution to Baroque literature. Written in elegant Spanish, it relates both terrestrial and spiritual details, many either not known or not totally accepted at the time. These included the way the earth looks from the space (contained in her unpublished 17th Century \\"Tratado de rendondez de la Tierra\\"); the Immaculate Conception of Virgin Mary, the Assumption of Mary, the duties of Michael the Archangel and Gabriel the Archangel; and meticulous detail on the childhood of Jesus. Other details that Mary related concerned Christ's Passion, Resurrection and Ascension. In addition to her 14 published works, Mary of Jesus also served as the spiritual (and sometimes political) advisor to King Philip IV of Spain, at his request and for more than 22 years. Their surviving correspondence includes over 600 letters.Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda: Correspondencia Con Felipe IV, Religi√≥n y Raz√≥n de Estado, with Introduction and Notes by Consolaci√≥n Baranda (Madrid: Editorial Castalia, 1991) Mystical bilocation and effect on missionaries Between 1620 and 1623, Mary of Jesus reported that she was often \\"transported by the aid of the angels\\" to settlements of a people called Jumanos. The Jumano Indians of New Spain (what is today Texas and New Mexico) had long been requesting missionaries, possibly hoping for protection from the Apaches. Eventually a mission led by the Franciscan Friar Juan de Salas visited them in 1629. The abbess reported further but less frequent visits afterwards, all while she physically remained in the monastery at √Ågreda. They thus are considered bilocations, an event where a person is, or seems to be, in two places at the same time. Before sending the friars, Father Alonzo de Benavides, Custodian of New Mexico, asked the natives why they were so eager to be baptized. They said they had been visited by a Lady in Blue who had told them to ask the fathers for help, pointing to a painting of a nun in a blue habit and saying she was dressed like that but was a beautiful young girl. The Jumanos visiting Isleta indicated that the Lady in Blue had visited them in the area now known as the Salinas National Monument, south of modern-day Mountainair, New Mexico, about 65 miles south of Albuquerque. At the same time, Fray Esteban de Perea brought Benavides an inquiry from Sor Mar√≠a's confessor in Spain asking whether there was any evidence that she had visited the Jumanos. As reports of Mary's mystical excursions to the New World proliferated, the Inquisition took notice, although she was not proceeded against with severity, perhaps because of her long written relationship with the Spanish king.Colahan, Clark A. The Visions of Sor Maria de Agreda: Writing Knowledge and Power (University of Arizona Press, 1994) Accounts of Mary's mystical apparitions in the American Southwest, as well as inspiring passages in Mystical City of God, so stirred 17th and 18th century missionaries that they credited her in their own life's work, making her an integral part of the colonial history of the United States.Palou, Francisco. Life and Apostolic Labors of the Venerable Father Jun√≠pero Serra, Translated by C. Scott Williams (Pasadena, CA: George Wharton James, 1913) Death and legacy Less than ten years after her death, Mary of Jesus was declared Venerable by Pope Clement X, in honor of her \\"heroic life of virtue\\". Although the process of beatification was opened in 1673, it has not as yet been completed. Various misinterpretations of Mary's writings led to the Mystical City of God being placed on the Church's Index Librorum Prohibitorum in August 1681, due to a faulty French translation published in 1678. The placement on the list of forbidden books proved temporary.Galitzin, Margaret C. Was Mother Mary of Agreda?'', in the series \\"Mary of Agreda in America - Part IV\\" Lying below the blue recumbent statue is the incorrupt body of the Venerable Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda in the Church of the Conceptionists Convent in √Ågreda, Spain. The tradition of the apostle St James and the shrine of El Pilar, reputed to be the first church dedicated to Mary, was given by Our Lady in an apparition to Sister Mary Agreda recorded in The Mystical City of God, and is credited with instigating the rebuilding of the fire-damaged Cathedral Basilica in Zaragosa in the Baroque style in 1681 by Charles II, King of Spain, completed and rededicated in 1686. =Incorruptible body= When Mary of Jesus's casket was opened in 1909, a cursory scientific examination was performed on the 17th century abbess's body. In 1989, a Spanish physician named Andreas Medina participated in another examination of the remains and told investigative journalist Javier Sierra in 1991: \\"What most surprised me about that case is that when we compared the state of the body, as it was described in the medical report from 1909, with how it appeared in 1989, we realized it had absolutely not deteriorated at all in the last eighty years.\\"O'Brien, Christopher, Enter the Valley (St. Martin's Paperbacks, 1999) Investigators took photographs and other evidence before re-sealing her casket, which remains on display in the monastery church. Some consider that incorruptibility, that is, lack of normal rot and decay after death, further evidence of sanctity. =Sainthood process= The abbess is considered \\"Venerable\\".

A will made by a testator suffering from an insane delusion that affects the provisions made in the will may fail in whole or in part. Only the portion of the will caused by the insane delusion fails, including potentially the entire will. Will contests often involve claims that the testator was suffering from an insane delusion. An insane delusion is distinct from testamentary capacity. A testator might be suffering from an insane delusion but otherwise possess the requisite capacity to make a will. Similarly, an insane delusion is distinct from a mere mistake. If suffering from an insane delusion, a testator is not subject to change his or her mind regarding the delusion if presented with contrary evidence, whereas a mistake is capable of being corrected if the testator is told the truth. Additionally, while an insane delusion may cause portions of a will to fail, most courts will not reform or invalidate a will because of a mistake unless it was the result of fraud.Jesse Dukeminier & Stanley M. Johanson, Wills, Trusts & Estates, Sixth Edition, Aspen Publishers, 2000, Origin The insane delusion concept was created in the 1826 British case Dew v. Clark. In that case, a father believed that his daughter was \\"the devil incarnate\\" and disinherited her in his will of 1818. After her father's death, evidence presented by the daughter showed that she was well known for her good disposition and that her father had falsely told others that he lavished his daughter with praise and wealth. The probate court found that the father's mindset when he made the 1818 will was normal in all respects except toward his daughter. The court found that his thoughts about her, \\"did and could only proceed from, and be founded in, insanity,\\" a \\"partial insanity\\" that only extended to his thoughts about his daughter and caused him to disinherit her. The court said that this delusion caused the will to fail.Dew v. Clark, 162 Eng. Rep. 410 (Prerog. 1826) Examples In the 1854 case Addington v. Wilson, the Indiana Supreme Court held that a testator who disinherited his daughters because he believed them to be witches was not for that reason alone so insane as to deem him incapable of making a valid will. The court justified its decision by pointing to distinguished jurists and religious figures who affirmed the possibility of witchcraft; if these people's beliefs did not render them insane, neither did the testator's.Addington v. Wilson, 5 Blackf. (Ind.) 137, 61 Am.Dec. 81 (Sup. Ct. Ind. 1854) In In re Robertson's Estate (1948), the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that a testator who declared that he had \\"no children\\" and \\"no deceased children\\" in his will, when he actually had two living children, was suffering from an insane delusion, as the testator had \\"no rational basis whatsoever\\" to declare that he had no children.In re Robertson's Estate, 189 P.2d 615 (Okla. 1948) References Category:Wills and trusts Category:Elder law Category:Common law Category:Legal concepts ","title":"Insane delusion"},{"id":"2279996","text":"Hanunoo may refer to: * Hanun√≥'o language, spoken by Mangyans in the Philippines * Hanun√≥'o script, used to write the Hanun√≥'o language. * Hanunoo (Unicode block) ","title":"Hanunoo"},{"id":"2280005","text":"Rutt Bridges is an American geophysicist and politician from Colorado and a member of the Democratic Party.

It had been the most important extra-parliamentary far-right organization of the post-war Italian republic. The name is shared by Movimento Politico Ordine Nuovo, a splinter group of Centro Studi Ordine Nuovo. The organization, considered as an attempt at reforming the Fascist Party (banned by the Constitution), was forcibly dissolved by the Italian government in 1973. Remaining elements of the group formed the Ordine Nero (Black Order) in 1974. Members and a leader of Movimento Politico Ordine Nuovo participated in several terrorist attacks. These include the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing, the 1970 Rome-Messina train attack, a grenade attack at a 1974 anti-fascist rally, and the 1974 Italicus Express bombing. History Previously, L'Ordine Nuovo (\\"The New Order\\") had been the name of a radical left-wing paper edited by Antonio Gramsci in the early 1920s, with Gramsci's followers being nicknamed \\"ordinovisti\\". However, later on the term - in Italian and various other languages - was appropriated by Fascists and Nazis, its original left-wing predecessors forgotten. The extreme right-wing organization here referred to, whose members were also nicknamed ordinovisti, though being the political opposite of the earlier ones, was born from an internal current and then a schism in the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI). In 1954 Arturo Michelini, a moderate seeking an alliance with the Italian Monarchic Party, and possibly with the Christian Democracy, became general secretary of the MSI. This led to the schism of the most intransigent and spiritualist, Evolian current (Nazism was also a reference), led by Pino Rauti, Lello Graziani and Sergio Baldassini. They refused any compromise that brought the party apart from aristocratic principles. The intransigent and spiritualist Ordine Nuovo was then founded in Rome, but still a part of the MSI. The real break with MSI happened at the MSI congress in Milan in 1956. Pino Rauti declared that, being disappointed with the moderate drift of the MSI, his movement would abandon the political scene, creating the \\"Centro Studi Ordine Nuovo\\", an association dedicated to \\"political studies and analysis\\". This wanted to be a literal application of the theses of Julius Evola, that is, an aristocratic refusal of contemporary, materialist society. Ordine Nuovo, nonetheless, had a capillary and hierarchical organization on the Italian territory, and often behaved more like an extra-parliamentary political organization than a simple \\"scholarship center\\".  Splinter group  In the 1969, Rauti, along with most of Ordine Nuovo, came back in the MSI party, then led by Giorgio Almirante. The remaining hardliners founded Movimento Politico Ordine Nuovo (\\"New Order Political Movement\\"). The motto of Ordine Nuovo was Il nostro onore si chiama fedelt√†, or \\"Our honour is named loyalty\\", also the motto of the Waffen SS (Meine Ehre hei√üt Treue). The symbol of the organization was a double-head axe. = Implication in terrorist attacks = Several members of Movimento Politico Ordine Nuovo, including one of its leaders, Pierluigi Concutelli,UN PO' DI STORIA (...) MPON: MOVIMENTO POLITICO ORDINE NUOVO participated in terrorist attacks.  1969 Piazza Fontana bombing and 1970 Rome-Messina train attack  On 12 December 1969, people belonging to or sympathizing for Ordine Nuovo placed a bomb in Piazza Fontana in Milan, killing 16 and wounding 90. This bombing marked the beginning of the \\"strategy of tension\\" in Italy. Ordine Nuovo member Delfo Zorzi was among those convicted for the crime on June 20, 2001, together with Carlo Maria Maggi and Giancarlo Rognoni, but all were later found not guilty in 2004.Repubblica.it/politica: Piazza Fontana, nessun colpevole Assolti in appello gli imputati In July 1970, members of Ordine Nuovo bombed the Rome-Messina train, killing 6 and wounding 100.  1974 Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia  In May 1974 eight activists were killed in Brescia when an anti-fascist protest was taking place in the municipal square. Due to a bomb placed in a trash bin, 8 people died from the explosion, over a hundred were wounded. On May 19, 2005, the Corte di Cassazione confirmed the arrest warrant against Delfo Zorzi, a former Ordine Nuovo member, who was also suspected of being the material perpetrator of the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing. Alongside Delfo Zorzi, his neo-fascist comrades Carlo Maria Maggi and Maurizio Tramonte, all members of Ordine Nuovo, are also suspected of having organized the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia. Italicus Express bombing 1974 On 4 August 1974 a Ferrovie dello Stato train was bombed in the early morning hours killing 12 and wounding 48. The following day, Ordine Nero (The new Ordine nuovo) claimed responsibility. In a written statement they said > We took revenge for Giancarlo Esposti. We wanted to show the nation that we > can place a bomb anywhere we want, whenever and however we please. Let us > see in autumn; we will drown democracy under a mountain of dead.

Background and education Russell was born in Florence, Tuscany, into the Russell family, one of England's leading Whig aristocratic families. His father was Major- General Lord George Russell, second son of the 6th Duke of Bedford. His mother was Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Honourable John Theophilus Rawdon and niece of the 1st Marquess of Hastings. His uncle was the 1st Earl Russell, twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.thepeerage.com Odo William Leopold Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill His education, like that of his two brothers, Francis and Arthur, was carried on entirely at home, under the general direction of his mother. Career in the Diplomatic Service In March 1849 Russell was appointed by Lord Malmesbury as attach√© at Vienna. From 1850 to 1852 he was temporarily employed in the foreign office, whence he passed to Paris. He remained there, however, only about two months, when he was transferred to Vienna. In 1853 he became second paid attach√© at Paris, and in August 1854 he was transferred as first paid attach√© to Constantinople, where he served under Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. He had charge of the embassy during his chief's two visits to the Crimea in 1855, but left the East to work under Lord Napier at Washington in 1857. In the following year he became secretary of legation at Florence, but was detached from that place to reside in Rome, where he remained for twelve years, until August 1870. During all that period he was the real though unofficial representative of Britain at the Vatican. Russell's personal success with Otto von Bismarck led to his appointment as ambassador at Berlin in October 1871. He admired the new Germany and liked Germans: during his thirteen years in Berlin he never forfeited the confidence of Bismarck. Just as he had understood his Constantinople chief, Stratford de Redcliffe, and had never been broken by his suspicious rages, so too he achieved a sympathetic understanding of Bismarck. He withstood the Iron Chancellor's rages about real or imaginary plots, dispelled his darkest suspicions of British policy, and penetrated to the core of Bismarckian motives and strategy. For example, he reported to London in October 1872 how Bismarck's plans for a Kulturkampf were backfiring by strengthening the ultramontane (pro-papal) position inside German Catholicism: :The German Bishops who were politically powerless in Germany and theologically in opposition to the Pope in Rome ‚Äì have now become powerful political leaders in Germany and enthusiastic defenders of the now infallible Faith of Rome, united, disciplined, and thirsting for martyrdom, thanks to Bismarck's uncalled for antiliberal declaration of War on the freedom they had hitherto peacefully enjoyed.Quoted in Edward Crankshaw, Bismarck (1981) pp 308-9 Russell was trusted by Victoria, the Crown Princess and the Hohenzollerns, but his cordiality to Bismarck's enemies was never tainted by the suspicion of intrigue. Nor was the objectivity of his dispatches compromised by his private belief that Kulturkampf must fail, or by his revulsion at Bismarck's persecution of Roman Catholicism. From the outset, he recognised Germany's colonial aspirations, though his appreciation of this complex situation was imperfect. In 1879 he was responsible for the novelty of attaching a commercial expert to the Berlin embassy staff. After his eldest brother became eventually 9th Duke of Bedford in 1872, Russell was granted the rank of a younger son of a duke, becoming known as Lord Odo Russell. He was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He was subsequently made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1874, a Knight Grand Gross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1879, and raised to the peerage as Baron Ampthill, of Ampthill in the County of Bedford, in 1881. He was British delegate at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, along with Disraeli and Salisbury. Family Lord Ampthill married Lady Emily Villiers, daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, on 5 May 1868. They had six children: *Hon.
