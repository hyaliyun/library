The first sounds she played...were sliding pitches suggesting a koto; soon she was plucking and tapping ethereal chords on both sides of the drumstick and then cooing, in a voice like affectionate baby talk, about innocence and mysticism...She continued with Brazilian pop songs transformed by her imaginative virtuosity, moving from gauzy delicacy to vigorous propulsion, from dreaming to dancing and back.\\" Discography * Danca do Tons (Crescente Produ√ß√µes, 1989) * Solo (Chesky, 1994) * Rhythms (Chesky, 1995) * Echoes of Brazil (Chesky, 1997) * Chameleon (PolyGram, 1998) * Nowhere with Jeff Young (Watersounds, 2002) * Danca das Ondas (Gha, 2003) * Three Guitars with John Abercrombie and Larry Coryell (Chesky, 2003) * Verde (Edge, 2004) * Wonderland (Edge, 2006) * Between Love and Luck (Quatro Ventos, 2013) * Love and Other Manias (O-tone, 2014) * Hatched (Quatro Ventos, 2015) Concerts on video * Three Guitars ‚Äì The Paris Concert 2004 with Larry Coryell and John Abercrombie (Inakustik, 2005) * Badi Assad (Flowfish, 2012) Film scores * Children of the Amazon by Denise Zmekhol (2008) with Nan√° Vasconcelos Notes References * Guitar Alive Interview External links * Official site Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from S√£o Paulo (state) Category:Brazilian female singers Category:Brazilian jazz guitarists Category:Brazilian percussionists Category:Brazilian people of Lebanese descent Category:Chesky Records artists Category:Women guitarists Category:20th-century Brazilian musicians Category:21st-century Brazilian musicians Category:20th-century women musicians Category:21st-century women musicians Category:Deutsche Grammophon artists ","title":"Badi Assad"},{"id":"9922757","text":"Demotte or DeMotte may refer to: People: * Rudy Demotte (born 1963), Belgian socialist politician and former Minister-President of Wallonia * William Demotte (born 1991), professional rugby union player * George Joseph Demotte (1877-1923), Belgian-born art dealer with galleries in Paris and New York City Places: * DeMotte, Indiana in the United States Other: * Demotte Shahnameh, also known as the Great Mongol Shahnameh, illustrated manuscript of the national epic of Greater Iran ","title":"Demotte"},{"id":"9922775","text":"Tora is the name of a 1988 music album by singer Anna Vissi.

Regarded as one of his county's all-time greats, Finnerty enjoyed a distinguished playing career at club level with Mullagh and at inter-county level with Galway. He was a wing-back on the latter team from 1985 until 1994 and collected two All-Ireland titles, one National Hurling League title and five All-Star awards. In retirement from playing Finnerty has maintained a keen association with the game. He has been a long-serving hurling analyst with RT√â on both The Sunday Game and Sunday Sport. From 2007 until 2010 Finnerty served as coach, under the management of Martin Brennan, to the Mayo senior hurling team. Biography Pete Finnerty was born in Mullagh, County Galway in 1964. From a young age he showed great interest in the game of hurling and, in time, he would become a key member of the great Galway team of the 1980s. He was educated principally at Ballinasloe secondary school where he fostered a reputation for himself as a no-nonsense defender. It was here that Finnerty first tasted success winning three All- Ireland Vocational Schools medals. Finnerty later worked with Bank of Ireland and also owns a franchise Supermac's restaurant in Tuam since opening it in the early 1990s. Playing career =Club= Finnerty played his club hurling with Mullagh, the club made famous by the legendary Tony Reddin. =Inter-county= Finnerty's hurling exploits in secondary school lead to an automatic selection on the Galway minor hurling team. He played against Tipperary in the All-Ireland minor final of 1982, however, he ended up on the losing side that day. Finnerty quickly graduated onto Galway's under-21 team, subsequently winning an All-Ireland medal with the side in 1983. His son Niall is one of the brightest football prospects in Galway at the moment. He is currently player of the Cortoon Shamrocks u21 team. That same year Finnerty made his senior debut in a National Hurling League game and he captured a place of his own on the team by the time the 1985 championship got underway. That year he played in his first All-Ireland final, however, victory went to Offaly on the day. In spite of this he was still presented with an All-Star award. In 1986 Galway reached another All-Ireland final, however, they were again defeated, this time by Cork. A second All-Star was collected by Finnerty. In 1987, in their third All-Ireland final appearance in-a-row, Galway took on Kilkenny. At the third time of asking Galway emerged victorious and Finnerty finally captured his first All-Ireland medal at senior level, before collecting his third All-Star award. In 1988 Tipperary were Galway's opponents in their fourth consecutive All-Ireland final appearance. Finnerty had another solid performance at wing-back and claimed his second All-Ireland title in the process, before later winning his fourth consecutive All-Star award. In 1989 Finnerty began the year by winning his first National Hurling League title, however, Galway's star centre-back, Tony Keady, was banned from playing for a year. The side had contemplated withdrawing from the championship in protest, however, they decided to play, eventually losing out to Tipp in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1990 Finnerty played in his fifth All-Ireland final in six seasons. Galway were the hot favourites to beat Cork and it looked as if that prediction would come true when the tribesmen went 7 points up. Cork clawed their way back and eventually went on to win on a scoreline of 5-15 to 2-21. In spite of this loss Finnerty still won a fifth All-Star award. Two years later in 1992 Finnerty missed the entire championship due to a cruciate knee injury. He returned in 1993 but couldn't command a regular place on the team. He did come on as a substitute in that year's All-Ireland final, however, victory went to Kilkenny. Finnerty regained his fitness in 1994 and played his last game against Offaly in the All-Ireland semi-final. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Finnerty has maintained a keen interest in hurling. In 2000 his exceptional talent was acknowledged when he was named on the Galway \\"Hurling Team of the Millennium.\\" He also works as an analyst on RT√â's Gaelic games programme The Sunday Game. In 2008 Finnerty became coach of the Mayo senior hurling team, and took them to the Christy Ring Cup semi-final that season, before being defeated by eventual champions Carlow. Finnerty remained as Mayo coach in 2009 and again guided them to the Tier Two hurling championship semi-final, this time going out to Down. In December 2009 Finnerty agreed to continue as coach of the Mayo hurlers for the 2010 season.

He played college football at Morgan State University. Early years Washington attended Chicago's John Marshall Harlan Career Academy, before receiving a football scholarship to play for Morgan State University. He was coached by Earl Banks, who at the time sent many of his players to professional football. He became a four year starter at cornerback and was part of a team that had 31 straight wins. As a senior, he was named co-captain, posted 6 interceptions and received All-CIAA honors. He finished his career with 15 interceptions. In 1993, he was inducted into the Morgan State University Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Washington was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 13th round (335th overall) of the 1970 NFL Draft. Even as a rookie, he was one of the best athletes on the team and showed his big play potential with a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against the Washington Redskins. He also blocked an extra point in Super Bowl V. His 48.4 yards per kick return that season remains a franchise record (though unofficial, as he only returned five kicks on the season).Cowboys leaders, yards per kick return Coming into his second year, he injured his knee while returning a kickoff in preseason and was waived injured on August 25, 1971. He would eventually rejoin the team and play in two games. When Herb Adderley retired in 1973, he had a chance to earn the left cornerback starting job, but he was passed over by Charlie Waters. After Waters struggled, he replaced him the next year and started 6 games. In 1974, he was named the starting left cornerback at mid-season and held the job until being slowed down by an ankle injury in the last 2 games. In 1975, he was the starter at left cornerback for the full season (14 starts), registered 4 interceptions (tied for second on the team) and helped the Cowboys reach Super Bowl X. But he is mostly remembered for his play against Lynn Swann, who finished the game with four receptions for a then Super Bowl record 161 yards, one touchdown and became the first wide receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors. Washington had excellent coverage on Swann on all 4 receptions, but Swann was able to make plays each time. The next year, he was replaced with Benny Barnes, but got a chance to start 5 games at right cornerback after Mel Renfro was injured, posting 4 interceptions (led the team). In 1977, he started 4 games at mid-season after Aaron Kyle suffered a fractured left wrist. He also filled in at left corner in Super Bowl XII when Barnes exited with a foot injury early in the game. In 1978, he started 3 games at left cornerback in place of Barnes who had foot problems, but was later sidelined himself by a right knee injury. He was waived on August 21, 1979. =New England Patriots= Washington signed with the New England Patriots as a free agent on September 13, 1979. He was released on November 1, to make room for tight end Al Chandler.

By 1990, the album sold more than 180,000 copies, and became the second best-selling album of 1990 in Greece. Singles and legacy \\"Pseftika\\" The album's first single \\"Pseftika\\" was among the first hit songs in Greece mixing Western dance vibes with Eastern sounds from India, Turkey and Greece. Nightclubs heavily played the modern Greek song, which until then nightclubs distinguished from their bouzoukia counterparts generally played only foreign music. It was so different from what Vissi had sung that she did not want to initially record the song, but ironically it turned out to be one of her biggest hits. Thus, \\"Pseftika\\" is noted as revolutionary to modern Greek song. \\"Fotia\\" :The 2nd single which had a rock sound followed the success of Pseftika. \\"Mpalomataki\\" :The 3rd single, the music video for the single was filmed in Morocco for a TV-special aired by Mega Channel in early 1990. \\"Oue Ki Alimono\\" :The 4th single climbed on the Top 10 of Greek and Cypriot Charts. \\"Kapnizo\\" :The 5th single also climbed on the Top 10 of Greek and Cypriot Charts.

During his satsangs, Sant Ajaib Singh would often talk about his youth - his study and search for the God of the guru granth sahib, his life with his adopted parents, and the time he spent with his first mahatma, Baba Bishan Das. While serving in the Indian army, Sant Ji would later meet with Baba Sawan Singh and describe the impact that Hazur Sawan Singh had on his life, referring to Sawan as \\"the most beautiful man I have ever met.\\" As conferred by Sawan Singh, Sant Ji would also discuss his long awaited and long anticipated meeting with his second Master, Kirpal Singh, and the orders he received regarding leaving his worldly possessions behind (including a large ashram) and being directed to meditate in an underground room. In addition to the publication of many of his talks and question/answer sessions by Sant Bani Press, Sant Ji was responsible for the 1982 English language translation of Kabir Sahib's story of creation, entitled The Anurag Sagar or Ocean of Love. He oversaw the extensive footnoting of the Sagar, and would occasionally joke about how he, an unlearned farmer, had managed to complete this work. A disciple claimed that during a satsang at SKA, India, February 1997, Ajaib Singh told a group of his western followers, \\"I will not be seeing any of you anymore\\". The disciple, Bar Bar Baba Ji, later discussed Ajaib's comments with another attendee, Jim Crawford, organizer of the then upcoming Abbotsford retreat in Canada, and suggested that he obtain cancellation insurance.http://www.barbarbabaji.com Sant Ji is widely considered the 18th Guru in the main line of Saints and Mahatmas dating back to Kabir, a practice referred to as Sant Mat or Surat Shabd Yoga.

Over a 22 year period, he initiated approximately 33,000 disciples, travelling extensively across North and South America, Europe, Africa and India. Sant Ajaib Singh died on July 6, 1997.

It was one of the shortest highways ever assigned in the province, at just in length. The highway has been through numerous re-numberings throughout its history, finally being transferred to local authority in mid-1970.  Route description  The former route of Highway 114, now known as Malden Road, is no longer maintained by the province nor by Essex County; it is a local road maintained by the Town of Tecumseh and the Town of Lakeshore. It is a narrow semi-rural township road. Though fully paved and with houses along much of its path, it is relatively lightly travelled. Between Manning Road and County Road 46, it is still signed as \\"HWY 114\\", though it was decommissioned in 1970. The route begins in the south at former Highway 3 (Talbot Road), just north of the current alignment of that highway. It proceeds northeast through Maidstone, flanked by houses on both sides. Approaching Manning Road (Essex County Road 19), the route briefly passes through farmland. Just northeast of the intersection with Manning Road, the route ends at Middle Road (Essex County Road 46), formerly Highway 98\\\\. At , it was one of the shortest King's Highways ever assigned by the province.  History  20px 20px 20px 20px Highway 114's routing started off as part of Highway 2. In 1929, there was a great renumbering in the area because the Ambassador Bridge opened. Highway 2 was rerouted along a different path just to the north, along North Talbot Road and Provincial Road (along what would become Highway 98). Malden Road was re- designated as Highway 2A until 1931, when the predecessor to Highway 98 received that numbering, and this road received the designation of Highway 3B (unrelated to Dougall Avenue's designation of 3B). This remained until 1938, when it was re-designated as Highway 98A, a spur of the newly created Highway 98. By 1954, this road became an independent non-spur road in its own right, and received the numbering of Highway 114. It remained this way until it was deleted in 1970.

Through much of the 20th century, The Advertiser was Adelaide's morning broadsheet, The News the afternoon tabloid, with The Sunday Mail covering weekend sport, and Messenger Newspapers covering community news.  History  = Mail = In 1912, Clarence Moody initially set up three newspapers ‚Äì the Sporting Mail (1912-1914), Saturday Mail (1912-1917), and the Mail. The first two titles lasted only a few years, and the Mail itself went into liquidation in late 1914. Ownership passed briefly to George Annells and Frank Stone, and then to Herbert Syme. In May 1923 News Limited purchased the Mail and moved the newspaper to North Terrace. By this time The News had developed a strong sporting focus, and results of Saturday sporting matches of all types and grades were reported in the Mail. = Sunday Mail = The paper's name briefly changed to The SA Sunday Mail on 6 February 1954, and then Sunday Mail in 1955. The original 1912 circulation of 15,000 had risen to 213,000 by 1962. For its first 60 years the Mail was printed on Saturday nights. Initially two editions were published, with a 'street' edition coming out at about 7:00 pm, followed by a midnight edition which was sold to theatre crowds later in the evening, and distributed throughout the state on Sunday mornings. The Sunday Mail was first published on a Sunday on 5 November 1972, and went on to survive the closure of The News in March 1992.  Content  A particular focus was given to football and horse racing, with many fine sporting photographs and articles being printed. West Torrens footballer and yachtsman Ossie O'Grady became sports writer in 1926 and wrote sometimes controversial sporting feature articles. In the 1930s Ron Boland began his newspaper career as the horse racing writer, 'Trafalgar'. He was later to become editor of the News. Early motoring was another important feature of the newspaper from the 1920s, as was the advent of commercial radio and aviation. From 1922 under the editorship of George Brickhill, the Mail was a well-presented newspaper with quality reading on a range of topics. No doubt the professionally presented real-estate pages helped fund the improvements. The much-loved 'Possum's pages' were born in 1921 as 'the Mail Club' with letters to 'Clubmates' written by 'Possum'. The page was called 'Mates own corner'. In 1924 May Gibbs's gumnut babies, 'Bib and Bub,' were the first full-scale comic page in the Mail. They were joined in 1932 by Bancks's Ginger Meggs. During the Second World War Lionel Coventry's 'Alec the Airman' joined the pages of the paper. Colour was introduced to the comics at the end of the war. Oswald Pryor was cartoonist for the Mail in 1922-1923, followed by Hal Gye and, in the late 1920s, R. W. Blundell. Harry Longson was cartoonist during the war years. The Second World War had a major impact, not least on newspaper reporting and production. Although horse racing and other sports were still covered in the pages of the Mail, space was also given to war news and the activities of the armed forces. During the war the 'Gossip by Deidre' page gave way to the less frivolous 'Diana's notebook' with photographs such as 'Miss Patricia Hubbard at work in her father's factory'Mail, 5 October 1940, p. 10 and other reflections of women's war effort activities. Even the 'Suburban acre' gardening page took on a more serious tone as 'Weeders digest'.

It is most often used to represent the Church of Scientology. The cross closely resembles the Christian cross, but differs from it with the addition of four diagonal rays between the conventional horizontal and vertical arms. The eight points of the cross represent the eight dynamics in Scientology: # The Self # Creativity, sex, and procreation (family) # Group, society, community # Species survival (humankind) # Life forms in general # Matter, Energy, Space & Time (physical universe) # Spirit (self or others as a spiritual being) # Infinity or Supreme being According to the Ability magazine, a sand casting presenting a cross was dug up by L. Ron Hubbard in the mid-1950s, the model of which \\"came from a very ancient Spanish mission in Arizona\\". This cross came to be the new minister insignia besides the formal ceremonial medallion and ribbon. He also occasionally referred to it as the \\"sunburst cross\\". Scholars speculate the Scientology cross may have been inspired by Aleister Crowley's use of the Rose Cross. The practice of prominently displaying the cross in Scientology centers was instituted in 1969 following hostile press coverage in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, when Scientology's status as a legitimate religion was being questioned.

A Republican, he was elected to the office in November 2006 and took office on January 3, 2007, succeeding Democrat Peg Lautenschlager. Van Hollen did not seek reelection in 2014 and left office on January 5, 2015. Background Van Hollen's father is John C. Van Hollen, a realtor and former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. The Van Hollen family lived near Chetek and later moved to Delta. He graduated from St. Olaf College in 1988 with an undergraduate degree in political science and economics. He earned his law degree two years later from the University of Wisconsin Law School. In 1993, Governor Tommy Thompson appointed Van Hollen District Attorney in Ashland County, where he served for six years. He was subsequently called to service again when Governor Thompson appointed him to serve as Bayfield County District Attorney. He was appointed as the U.S. Attorney for Wisconsin's Western District where he served in that role from 2002 to 2005. Van Hollen won the Republican nomination for Attorney General in 2006 over then-Waukesha County District Attorney Paul Bucher. In the general election, he narrowly defeated Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, who had previously bested Lautenschlager in the Democratic primary. Van Hollen was the only Republican in Wisconsin to win a statewide race in 2006. In 2010, he defeated his Democratic opponent by a comfortable margin. Attorney general Upon taking office in 2007, Van Hollen took on a backlog of DNA evidence at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory. The backlog had grown to thousands of cases. He worked with the Wisconsin Legislature to secure additional resources to solve the backlog and created new efficiencies at the Crime Lab. In 2008, Van Hollen announced changes made by his administration have reduced the backlog by 43% since he took office. His goal was to eliminate the backlog by December 2010. In April 2010, Van Hollen reached that goal and eliminated the backlog of DNA evidence at the Crime Lab. He secured funding from the federal government to investigate cold case crimes. One of the cold cases led to the arrest of Walter Ellis, a suspected serial killer in Milwaukee. In September 2008, Van Hollen sued the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, the state elections agency, to force it check voter registrations for accuracy. Van Hollen said that the motivation for the lawsuit was that potentially illegal votes could sway the election. On October 23, 2008, a Dane County circuit judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Van Hollen did not have standing to bring the lawsuit, because only the United States Attorney General can enforce federal law. Van Hollen appealed the judge's ruling but later dropped it when the Government Accountability Board updated their voter check procedure. On October 7, 2013, Van Hollen announced he would not seek reelection in 2014 for a third term as attorney general.'J.B.

They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P√°vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber√≠a, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal√≥n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos√© Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra√∫l Ciro and Alejandro Fr√≥meta: Super√°vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel√©n and V√≠ctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P√°vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti√©rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber√≠a had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Formell, Irakere by Chucho Vald√©s, or NG La Banda by Jos√© Luis Cort√©s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr√≠a and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals. Band members *Vanito Brown: Chronicler of personal issues, a versatile songwriter. The scale of his work ranges from a contemporary rock ballad to the most traditional of Cuban music. Currently recording a solo album with producer Robin Taylor-Firth for the BlancoMusic.com label. *Alejandro Guti√©rrez: It would be fair to say he is a modern-day bolerista, with Filin (feeling) and urban song influences of the continental south, though he is able to create the most contemporary rock; the beauty of his singing and compositions is outstanding. *Luis Alberto Barber√≠a: The resonance of his voice and guitar work takes on Afro-Cuban rhythms. His melodies are lyrical with jazz influences. His poetry, colloquially uninhibited due to its exquisite Cubanness. He has worked with Ketama on their recordings and tours. *Jose Luis Medina: Refined pop successfully blended with son, guajira and guaracha, able to come up with the barest social criticism or the most conciliatory ballad. Boris Larramendi, Kelvis Ochoa, Andy Villal√≥n and Pepe del Valle have also been members of the band. Discography In 1998 they record \\"Habana Oculta\\", with the participation of Alejandro Fr√≥meta and Ra√∫l Ciro from Super√°vit. Already as Habana Abierta they record \\"Habana Abierta\\", \\"24 horas\\" and \\"Boomerang\\", this last one in 2006 with the collaboration of musicians such as Bebo Vald√©s and the arrangements of Alain P√©rez. Three of its members have recorded solo albums: Kelvis Ochoa recorded \\"Kelvis\\", Boris Larramendi \\"Yo no tengo la culpa\\" and Luis Barber√≠a, \\"Luis Barber√≠a\\". Kelvis Ochoa and Boris Larramendi were also the singers of Habana Blues Band, the band created after the success of the movie Habana Blues (directed by Benito Zambrano), winner of a Best Soundtrack Goya Award in 2006. Nowadays Habana Abierta is about to present its new album, self-produced, and Vanito Brown is preparing his solo album with producer Robin Taylor-Firth.

He received his Ph.D. and MA in Art History from Concordia University, Montreal, and has written about the intersection of biopolitics, medicalization, and artistic experience from the eighteenth to early twenty-first centuries. He has a BA from Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT. For many years Gallo worked as a psychiatric crisis support worker and services coordinator for people with psychiatric and developmental disabilities in northern Vermont. Additionally, the artist has been active in the Grass Roots Art and Community Efforts (GRACE) in Hardwick, VT. He has organized numerous exhibitions including \\"Insider Art,\\" (GRACE traveling exhibition, 1990), and Our Yard in the Future: The Art of Gayleen Aiken (Horton Gallery, 2007). He has contributed criticism to Art in America and Art New England, among others. The artist is represented by Anthony Reynolds Gallery in London, UK. Gallo's works have been featured in solo and group exhibitions in the United States and Europe, and are included in notable collections of contemporary art. Gallo draws from a wide variety of sources ‚Äì art historical, political, and literary, and often incorporates poetic, philosophical and found texts in his mixed-media paintings. He utilizes simple formal structures which emphasize the materiality of painting, and his works alternate between or combine both abstract and figurative elements. Nautical imagery derived from historical sources such as the \\"ship of fools,\\" and the \\"ship of state,\\" are among his signature subjects. His paintings often incorporate unconventional materials, including buttons, toothpicks, newspaper clippings, found photographs, string, typed texts, dental floss and chicken bones. His ‚Äúimprovisatory‚Äù style has been compared to that of Ree Morton, Joy Division and Forrest Bess. Critic Jonathon Goodman writes that in current art trends this kind of ‚Äúad hoc creativity often serves to mask poor skills, but in Gallo‚Äôs case, the rawness is a genuine part of his aesthetic, whose ungainliness keeps us thinking.‚Äú Notable exhibitions *CaixaForum, Barcelona, Spain *Anthony Reynolds Gallery, Angels Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain *The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland *\\"The Patients and the Doctors\\", Zieher Smith and Horton Gallery, New York, NY *Anthony Reynolds Gallery, London UK *Fool's House, LeRoy Neiman Gallery, Columbia University, New York, NY *Update, White Columns, New York, NY *Sequence and Consequence, Steven Kasher Gallery, New York, NY *White Columns (White Room), New York, NY *Troubling Customs, Ontario College of Art and Design, Toronto, Ontario and The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA References =Citations= =General references= {{cite web last1=Dunn first1=Aidan title=Peter Gallo's intensely personal art of chicken bones and ‚Äòskinhttps://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/peter-gallo-s- intensely-personal-art-of-chicken-bones-and-skin-1.1959475 External links *Gallo's work in the Horton Gallery *'Del cor i les tenebrous: Peter Gallo' EL PAIS *Anthony Reynolds Gallery, London *Zeher Smith and Horton, New York NY *'Peter Gallo' Brooklyn Rail *Holland Cotter, New York Times *Review: Peter Gallo @ White Column in Art In America *Steven Kasher Gallery, New York (images) *Review: Peter Gallo @ Wendy Cooper Gallery, Artforum *Peter Gallo - at ArtFactsNet *Works by Peter Gallo at the Horton Gallery NYC Category:1959 births Category:American artists Category:Artists from Vermont Category:Living people Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:Concordia University alumni Category:People from Rutland, Vermont Category:People from Hyde Park, Vermont ","title":"Peter Gallo"},{"id":"9923451","text":"Rensselaer is an Amtrak station in Rensselaer, Indiana, served by the Cardinal.

The first native of the state of Utah and the first Mormon to play in the major leagues, Castleton made his debut with the Highlanders on April 16, 1907, and played his final game with the Reds on May 29, 1910. Castleton's potential as a player was undermined by chronic health problems that ultimately forced him to retire. He is most often remembered for pitching a perfect game while playing for a team in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League.  Early years  Castleton was born in Salt Lake City, to parents who were born in England. After arriving in the United States, his grandfather, James Castleton, worked as a gardener for Brigham Young, eventually saving enough money to establish his own business. His father, Charles Castleton, was a successful carpenter, and young Roy enjoyed the amenities of a middle-class upbringing. A strong student who excelled at mathematics, Castleton gravitated toward a career in sports shortly after graduating from high school.  Minor league career  In 1904, Castleton signed on with the Salt Lake City ball club, which played in the Class B Pacific National League. In the 1904‚Äì1905 season, he pitched for another team based in Ogden, Utah, that was also poised to enter the league. Still a teenager, he nevertheless distinguished himself with a 16-inning loss. In 1906, Castleton moved east and joined the minor league Youngstown Ohio Works, a team based in the steel-production center of Youngstown, Ohio. The youngest player on a club of seasoned veterans, Castleton gained national exposure with a perfect game against rival Akron, shutting them out at 4‚Äì0. The local media compared the feat to Cy Young's perfect game a year earlier, and Castleton quickly received offers from major league managers, including Clark Griffith of the New York Highlanders. Drafted by the Highlanders, Castleton played out the remainder of the season in Youngstown, ending with a 22‚Äì12 record and striking out 156 batters in 278 innings.  Major league career  After spring training in Atlanta, Castleton was one of five pitchers used in an opening game against the Philadelphia Athletics. After pitching a hitless inning, he was selected as starting pitcher for an exhibition game with Newark. Unfortunately, he performed poorly and was sent back to Atlanta for additional experience. Once there, Castleton pitched formidably in the Southern Association, winning 10 of 13 decisions for Atlanta, despite earlier inactivity due to a sore arm. At the close of the Southern Association's season, Castleton was called to rejoin the New York Highlanders, where he made two starts in the last week of the American League season. In his first start, during a contest with the St. Louis Browns, Castleton allowed five hits, striking out two, and walking one. Despite New York's 3‚Äì1 loss to the Browns, the pitcher gained positive reviews. During his second start, in a match with the Chicago White Sox, Castleton allowed six hits, striking out three and walking one. Despite Castleton's solid pitching, manager Griffith chose to option Castleton to Atlanta for additional seasoning‚Äîa decision that had unexpectedly tragic implications for Castleton's career. After a strong start, Castleton suffered a bout with typhoid fever that left him in uncertain health from that point on. His poor health contributed to an inconsistent record, which resulted in his eventual release to Cincinnati in 1909. In the only game of a scheduled doubleheader with Boston (the other games had been cancelled due to inclement weather), Castleton finished with four strikeouts and only one walk. Unfortunately, this was followed by a disastrous appearance in a July 25 bout with St. Louis. Continual health problems that evidently resulted from his 1908 illness impeded his performance, and he was forced to endure long periods of inactivity.  Later years  After playing his final game with Cincinnati on May 29, 1910, Castleton continued to pitch for two more seasons with minor league teams in the Pacific Coast League. Despite strong showings, Castleton opted to retire in 1912, as concerns about his damaged health mounted. While his later career was impeded by illness, Castleton was long remembered for his early performance in the Southern Association as well as his perfect game as a minor league pitcher. After retiring from baseball, Castleton returned to Salt Lake City, where he married Ester Adella Kjeldsen and established a lucrative practice as an accountant. He eventually relocated with his wife to Los Angeles, where he died in 1967. His remains were returned to Salt Lake City for burial.

He is credited as the first western trained psychiatrist in Nigeria and Africa. Between 1971 and 1988, he worked at the World Health Organization, becoming the agency's Deputy Director General. Early life Lambo was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He attended the famous Baptist Boys' High School, Abeokuta from 1935 to 1940. He then proceeded to the University of Birmingham, where he studied medicine. To further his studies and become specialized, in 1952, he enrolled at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Adeoye Lambo in due time became famous for his work in ethno-psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology. Career In 1954, after studying and working as a surgeon in Britain, Dr Lambo returned to Nigeria where he was soon made the specialist in charge at the newly built Aro psychiatric hospital, Abeokuta. By then, Nigeria was undergoing a transition towards political independence which had hastened a culture of innovation and change instead of a period of feared stagnation or even regression. Prior to the independence movement, the Federal Government had tried to replicate the European system of creating asylums in the cities for lunatics and mentally ill individuals who were regarded as a social nuisance in the streets of many urban areas. The need to put the social anomalous individuals under control, sometimes care and confinement was initiated and a few asylums including one at Yaba were built. However, the institutionalization of mental health was viewed with suspicion by many Nigerians and many still depended on native medicines and herbalists for care. Adeoye Lambo sensing a ground for development, used the opportunity of an independent regional government to start his own out-patient treatment services, the Aro village, pioneering the use of modern curative techniques combined with traditional religion and native medicines. Adeoye, while at Aro, sought the help of farmers near the asylum to take some of the patients as laborers, while they simultaneously underwent medical treatment, and the patients also paid for any extra services required, such as housing. He traveled around the country and brought in a few traditional healers from different parts of Nigeria as practitioners. His style helped relieve public mistrust of mental health hospitals and introduced to public discourse the care and treatment of mentally ill citizens. He is credited as providing a platform for re-integrating mentally ill patients into a normal setting and environment and to a certain extent shedding at least some of the stigma associated with those suffering from mental illness.

McKenna S.J., founder of S.O.M.E. (So Others Might Eat) and advocate of the Sursum Corda Cooperative. He was born on January 2, 1899 and died on May 11, 1982. The youngest of 6 children, Horace was born in 1899 New York City, the son of Dr. Charles F. McKenna, a respected chemist and first chemical engineering graduate of Columbia University School of Mines, and Laura O'Neill McKenna. Educated at Fordham Preparatory School, he entered the Society of Jesus at St. Andrew-on-the-Hudson on July 30, 1916. Between 1921 and 1923, he taught in a Jesuit school in Manila, Philippines. There, he discovered the desperate needs of the poor and oppressed. He was ordained June 23, 1929 and assigned to pastor parishes in southern Maryland amidst poverty and segregation including St. Peter Claver's Church, St. James' Church, St. Ignatius' Church and St. Inigoes's where he was assigned in June 1931. Here he worked for twenty-two years, and among his efforts helped create the Ridge Purchasing and Marketing Association. He was active in civil rights, Vietnam- era anti-war protests and the Poor People's Campaign. From 1953 to 1958, he served at St. Aloysius Gonzaga parish, a Jesuit church a few blocks north of the U.S. Capitol and then as assistant pastor at the Church of the Ges√∫ in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1958 to 1964. In 1964 he returned to St. Aloysius and remained there for the rest of his life, living at Gonzaga College High School and serving the poor. In his commitment to social justice in Washington, D.C., Fr. McKenna founded So Others Might Eat, a soup kitchen, clinic and employment center; Martha's Table, a soup kitchen and child education center; and House of Ruth, a center for homeless women. He was also one of the leaders in establishing the Sursum Corda Cooperative, a housing development for the poor. Documentation of his life's work is maintained in the Georgetown University Library Special Collections Division. Fr. McKenna was named \\"Washingtonian of the Year\\" by Washingtonian Magazine in 1977. He received an honorary degree from the University of Scranton in 1998. The McKenna Center, a local shelter and soup kitchen for homeless men, located under the Great Church of St. Aloysius, was named after him in 1982. McKenna Walk NW, a short street within Sursum Corda, is also named after him. The Father McKenna Center is still located in the basement of Saint Aloysius Catholic Church at 900 North Capitol Street NW in Washington, DC. The McKenna Center exists to meet the needs of the poor and homeless who reside in one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods despite being in the shadow of the US Capitol Building. McKenna Center serves the needs of the poor, men, women and children. Each day, the McKenna Center fulfills the Gospel instruction to ‚Äúfeed the hungry, shelter the homeless and clothe the naked‚Äù.

His 85-day stint as Chief Justice, abbreviated only because of the rule requiring mandatory retirement upon reaching the age of 70, was the second-shortest such tenure in Philippine history. Prior to his promotion as Chief Justice, Makasiar had served for 15 years as an Associate Justice. Profile Makasiar was born in Siaton, Negros Oriental on November 20, 1915 to Agust√≠n Makasiar and Petra Valencia. He finished his primary and secondary education in his home province. He completed his undergraduate studies at the Far Eastern University, and enrolled at the University of the Philippines College of Law, where he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree, cum laude, in 1939.Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Vol. III, p. 61 He later obtained a Master of Laws degree from the University of Santo Tomas. Upon passing the bar in 1939, Makasiar joined the government service as an attorney with the Department of Justice. He would not leave the government service until his retirement from the Supreme Court in 1985. Makasiar rose in the ranks, beginning with a stint with the Office of the Solicitor General, then as a trial court judge beginning in 1954. He was appointed Solicitor-General and Undersecretary of the Department of Justice from 1968 to 1970, and as Secretary of Justice from May until August 1970, at which time he was appointed as Associate Justice to the Supreme Court.Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Vol. III, at 62 Prior to his appointment to the High Court, Makasiar also worked as a law professor in several universities, including the Manuel L. Quezon University and the San Beda College. He was married to Teofista F. Santos of Rizal with whom he had six children: Loretta M. Sicat, Rosella Jean M. Puno, Barry, Gary, Cynthia and Eleanore Lynn M. Paez. Supreme Court service Makasiar served a total of 15 years on the Court, all within the term of his appointer and law school classmateRes Gestae, p. 199 President Ferdinand E. Marcos. He became chairman of the Judiciary Code Committee, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on the Revised Rules of Court, and the first chairman of the Sharia bar examinations inaugurated in 1984. =Jurisprudence= The most prominent issues during Makasiar's tenure on the Court concerned the validity of the acts of the martial law regime began by Marcos in 1972. On those issues, Makasiar had been described as a loyal ally of Marcos and a consistent supporter of the President's New Society policies. He was among the Justices who voted to affirm the validity of the 1973 Constitution in the seminal case of Javellana v. Executive Secretary, 50 SCRA 33 (1973). More prominently, in Aquino v. COMELEC, 62 SCRA 33 (1975), Makasiar wrote for the Court as it denied petitions for prohibition which maintained that Marcos, whose original term as President expired 2 years earlier, held no legal office nor lawful authority. Relying on Javellana and Aquino v. Ponce-Enrile (which affirmed the validity of the 1972 proclamation of martial law), Makasiar wrote that Marcos was the de jure incumbent President of the Philippines. In questions concerning labor law and social justice, Makasiar's opinions for the Court reflected sympathies to the common man, and would sometimes resort in rebuke to injustices as reflected by the facts of the case. For example, in Carbonell v. CA, 69 SCRA 99(1976), Makasiar wrote: > Hence, Carbonell's prior purchase of the land was made in good faith. Her > good faith subsisted and continued to exist when she recorded her adverse > claim four (4) days prior to the registration of Infante's deed of sale. > Carbonell's good faith did not cease after Poncio told her on January 31, > 1955 of his second sale of the same lot to Infante, Because of that > information, Carbonell wanted an audience with Infante, which desire > underscores Carbonell's good faith. With an aristocratic disdain unworthy of > the good breeding of a good Christian and good neighbor, Infante snubbed > Carbonell like a leper and refused to see her. So Carbonell did the next > best thing to protect her right ‚Äî she registered her adverse claim on > February 8, 1955. Under the circumstances, this recording of her adverse > claim should be deemed to have been done in good faith and should emphasize > Infante's bad faith when she registered her deed of sale four (4) days later > on February 12, 1955. In Menez v. ECC, G.R. L-48488, April 25, 1980, a case involving the upholding of a teacher‚Äôs compensation due to occupational disease, Makasiar expounded at length on the plight of public school teachers: > ... Rheumatoid arthritis and pneumonitis can be considered as such > occupational diseases. All public high school teachers, like herein > petitioner, admittedly the most underpaid but overworked employees of the > government, are subject to emotional strains and stresses, dealing as they > do with intractable teenagers especially young boys, and harassed as they > are by various extra-curricular or non- academic assignments, aside from > preparing lesson plans until late at night, if they are not badgered by very > demanding superiors. In the case of the petitioner, her emotional tension is > heightened by the fact that the high school in which she teaches is situated > in a tough area - Binondo district, which is inhabited by thugs and other > criminal elements and further aggravated by the heavy pollution and > congestion therein as well as the stinking smell of the dirty Estero de la > Reina nearby. Women, like herein petitioner, are most vulnerable to such > unhealthy conditions. The pitiful situation of all public school teachers is > further accentuated by poor diet for they can ill-afford nutritious food. > xxx In her work, petitioner also has to contend with the natural elements, > like the inclement weather ‚Äî heavy rains, typhoons ‚Äî as well as dust ‚Äî and > disease-ridden surroundings peculiar to an insanitary slum area. xxx These > unwholesome conditions are \\"normal and consistently present in\\" or are the > \\"hazards peculiar to\\" the occupation of a public high school teacher. It is > therefore evident that rheumatoid arthritis and pneumonitis are the \\"natural > incidents\\" of petitioner's occupation as such public high school teacher. > xxx It must be borne in mind that petitioner was a teacher of the Raja > Soliman High School which is located in the heart of Binondo District.

Had the tradition of seniority been observed by Marcos, Claudio Teehankee, who was appointed to the Court nearly two years prior to Makasiar, would have been elevated as Chief Justice. However, Teehankee had constantly voted to nullify the actions of the martial law regime, in contrast to the more favorable positions of Makasiar. During Makasiar's brief tenure as Chief Justice, the Supreme Court issued two notable rulings favorable to the Marcos government.Res Gestae, p. 200-201 In Galman v. Pamaran, 138 SCRA 294 (1985), the Court ruled in favor of the defendants in the pending murder trial of Benigno Aquino, Jr. after they sought the exclusion of their earlier testimonies before the Agrava Board previously tasked with investigating the Aquino assassination. In Ilagan v. Enrile, 139 SCRA 349(1985), the Court refused to act on petitions for habeas corpus filed in behalf of 3 lawyers who had been arrested and detained without warrants of arrest, ruling that the petitions were mooted by the subsequent filing of criminal informations for rebellion against the lawyers. Retirement and death Makasiar retired from the Supreme Court upon reaching the age of 70 in November 1985. He died 7 years later, on February 19, 1992 in Manila.

It occurs in most of east and southeast Brazil from Maranh√£o south to Rio Grande do Sul states, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and central regions of Argentina. It is one of the most common birds across much of southeastern Brazil, and is known there under the name sabi√°-laranjeira (). It was famously referred to in the well-known first strophe of the Brazilian nationalist poem Can√ß√£o do ex√≠lio. The rufous-bellied thrush has been the state bird of S√£o Paulo since 1966, and the national bird of Brazil since 2002. It is highly regarded in Brazil, where its song is often heard in the afternoons, but specially during the nights between August and November, where thousands of them sing until the sunrise, and is often seen as \\"the spirit of the Brazilian commoner\\". Description This species is named after its distinctive reddish-orange underparts. Rufous-bellied thrushes can reach a length of 25 cm and weigh up to 68 g (male) or 78 g (female),Sick et al. (1997): p.705 though weights of about 59 g for males and 64 g for females are more usual. Contrary to what one might expect from the rather marked weight difference, the females are not larger, only plumper; their tarsus is actually a bit shorter than that of males on average. Habits Found in forests and urban wooded areas, it is an omnivorous bird. Its food consists mainly of fruits and arthropods,Sick et al. (1997): p.701 and it can sometimes be seen attending mixed-species feeding flocks and moving through the bushes with many other birds.Machado (1999), Olson & Alvarenga (2006) It has been observed to squabble with a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in the undergrowth over food flushed by an army ant column, but this was during the dry season when fruits are scarce.de Lyra-Neves et al. (2007) Nesting It builds an open- cup nest, sometimes right on the forest floor, sometimes more than 20 meters high in a tree, but usually 4‚Äì5 meters above ground. In the yungas of NW Argentina, nesting occurred in the wet season from October to March, with most birds breeding in November‚ÄìDecember. The three, sometimes two eggs measure about 27-28 by 20 mm, and weigh c.5.7-5.9 grams each. They are incubated for about 12‚Äì13 days, and young take about that long again until they fledge. Incubation is solely by the female, which spends considerable time on the nest. The nestlings are attended by both parents however; as the young near fledging, they are fed every 5‚Äì7 minutes or so on average. Predation may be a major cause of brood failure; in the southern Andean yungas it was noted to be especially high during the nestling time and far less significant during incubation.Auer et al.

Today, it is known as County Road 20. On March 31, 1997, Highway 18 was downloaded from Ruthven to Leamington, and was temporarily rerouted to end at Highway 3. However, on January 1 1998, the entire route was downloaded to Essex County.  Route description  From here (the Windsor city limits), it becomes very unclear and contradictory as to whether Highway 18 travelled east along E.C. Row to the Huron Church Road interchange, or north-west along Sandwich Parkway to Sandwich Street and Riverside Drive, to terminate at the foot of Ouellette Avenue (Highway 3B). This was compounded by the fact that E.C. Row had the secret 7000-series highway designation of Highway 7087. The City of Windsor had assumed all control of Highway 18 (Ojibway Parkway) within its limits, which are north of Morton Drive, but since Highway 18 was signed along E.C. Row to Highway 3 in the period of 1993 to 1998 (Huron Church Road), it is assumed that this is its terminus. While Highway 18 was under provincial control, the road was simply known as Seacliff Drive in Leamington, and travelled from its intersection with Highway 18 (at Erie Street), to County Road 37, east of the town. When the road was deleted as a Provincial highway, the designation of CR 20 was extended on the entire path of Highway 18. When the government began downloading provincial highways to the individual counties, districts, regions, towns, and cities on April 1, 1997, the part of road between Ruthven and Leamington was turned back and re-designated as an extension of Essex CR 20. In return, Highway 18 was briefly re-routed along Essex County Road 45 (which was Highway 18B from 1937 to 1954, and then Highway 107 until 1970), to Highway 3 in Ruthven. This was a temporary measure, as the rest of the Highway was gone from the network as of January 1, 1998. The road is fairly heavily travelled, particularly between the major communities, such as Kingsville and Leamington, and from Amherstburg north to LaSalle and Windsor (where it continues as Ojibway Parkway). The road also contains the Heritage Highway and Detroit River Heritage Parkway designations for most of its length. The road is four-lanes from Amherstburg to Windsor, but is generally 2 lanes for the remainder of its routing.  History  The route of former Highway 18 is far different from its original one (at 54.9 km in length), which was commissioned in 1930. It was supposed to be an \\"alternate route\\" to Highway 2 from Windsor to Tilbury, but was much more direct, so Highway 2 was re-aligned along Highway 18's path. In turn, Highway 18 was extended to travel from Windsor to Amherstburg and Leamington before Highway 2 absorbed its former path from Windsor to Tilbury. The new Windsor- Amherstburg-Leamington alignment was 79 km in length, and was almost entirely paved. There was one large gap of gravel from Amherstburg to Kingsville. The road started at Highway 3A (Later to become the Dougall Avenue Highway 3B designation) at the entrance of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, and ran along a huge loop along the western and southern edges of Essex County, to meet back up with Highway 3 in Leamington. By 1935, Highway 18 was paved between Harrow and Kingsville, and from Amherstburg to Malden Centre. The final gap of gravel was from Malden Centre to Kingsville, and that was paved in 1937. The highway was gradually widened to accommodate rising traffic volumes, mainly from Amherstburg to Windsor. In 1982, the E.C. Row Expressway was extended from Huron Church Road in Windsor, west to Ojibway Parkway (Highway 18). During the construction of the E. C. Row Expressway in the 1960s and 1970s, the road was upgraded to four lanes wide (undivided, and with residential and business accesses), as a temporary measure to see a potential extension of E.C. Row built all the way to Amherstburg. This never materialised, however, and the expressway simply feeds onto Ojibway Parkway and County Road 20. Before being extended along the entire routing of Highway 18, Essex County Road 20 travelled from Erie Street (Highway 77) in downtown Leamington, for 7 km due- east along Seacliff Drive, before terminating at the intersection with County Road 37 (both roads share the intersection as their termini) near Hillman Marsh. West of the intersection with Erie Street, was Highway 18.

Charles Robertson Skene (26 May 1914 - 24 August 1997), commonly known as Robert or Bob and nicknamed Hurricane Bob, was an Australian 10-goal polo player. He was a founding inductee of the Australian Polo Federation Hall of Fame, the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and the U.S. Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame. Biography Skene was born in Assam, India to an Australian tea planter, Curtis Skene. His father was a distinguished polo player, becoming an eight-goal player in 1929. Charles Skene began his polo- playing career playing country club polo in Australia with his father and friends. He was a two-goal player at 18. In 1937 he was on the Ashton Brothers Australian team that won the Champion Cup at the Hurlingham Club in London. At 25 he received a nine-goal rating playing for England vs. the United States in the Westchester Cup on Long Island, New York. Skene remained in the United States after the match, working in the war relief effort in the Bundles for Britain campaign. He played no polo until 1949. Wanting to contribute more to the war effort, he soon joined the Indian army, becoming an officer in a Gurkhas regiment. In February 1942 he was posted to Malaya, then taken prisoner by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore the same month. He was held in Singapore's infamous Changi Prison for 3¬Ω years. In late 1946 Skene was discharged from the army; he became a racing steward in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. In 1949 he was invited to play for England again, vs. Argentina in Argentina. The Argentines initially gave him a handicap of six goals, but soon raised that to nine goals. In 1950, he was hired by Russell E. Havenstrite to manage the Beverly Hills Polo Club in Beverly Hills, California. At the end of the 1950 season he was raised to a ten-goal ranking (the maximum possible). He played in eight U.S. Open Championships, and was on the winning side three times. He retained his ten-goal ranking for 17 years, until the age of 53. In 1954 he became the first foreigner to play for an Argentine team (El Trebol) in an Argentine Open. He was invited to play there again in 1956. Both times he was on the winning team. In 1960 he moved to Santa Barbara, California, where he became manager of the Santa Barbara Polo Club. In the early 1970s the historic club was in financial difficulty. Membership and patronage had dropped, and property developers were trying to redevelop the polo fields. Skene worked keeping the club afloat, lobbying the county supervisors against development proposals, organizing volunteers, repairing stables, organizing teams and playing, and generating greater interest and a larger membership. He is credited with saving polo in Santa Barbara. In 1972 and 1973 he made extensive travels around the United States, teaching polo schools at various polo clubs. In 1988 Skene was inducted into the Sports Australia Hall of Fame and in 1990 he was inducted into the United States Polo Hall of Fame. The Santa Barbara club awards the annual Robert Skene Trophy to twenty-goal tournament winners. He died on 24 August 1997 in Santa Barbara, California at the age of 83.

It is a common fruit in Nepal also called lapsi. It is native to much of Asia from India to China to Japan to Bhutan and Nepal. Its fruit is about 3 centimeters long and has a soft whitish sour flesh and green to yellow skin. The fruit is made into pickles, fruit tarts, and sour, spicy candy in Nepal. The tree has long been cultivated in rural Nepal for its fruit. The fruit is nutritious and has a price comparable to the mandarin orange on the Nepalese market. This is a deciduous tree growing up to 20 meters tall. The smaller branches are purple-brown in color. The compound leaves are up to long and divided into 3 to 6 papery oval leaflets each up to . The tree is dioecious, with male and female trees producing different types of inflorescence. Male flowers occur in long clusters and have curving, brown- veined petals about 3 millimeters long. Female flowers are solitary in leaf axils at the tips of branches. They are larger than the male flowers and yield the edible drupe. The fallen fruits are consumed and dispersed by sambar and barking deer. Besides fruit, the tree yields valuable wood and hard seeds which are burned for fuel, and has parts used medicinally in Vietnam.

Long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the formation of fatty acyl-CoA by a two- step process proceeding through an adenylated intermediate. The enzyme catalyzes the following reaction, :Fatty acid + CoA + ATP ‚áå Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi It is present in all organisms from bacteria to humans. It catalyzes the pre-step reaction for Œ≤-oxidation of fatty acids or can be incorporated in phospholipids.  Function  Long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, LC-FACS, plays a role in the physiological regulation of various cellular functions via the production of long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters, which reportedly have affected protein transport, enzyme activation, protein acylation, cell signaling, and transcriptional regulation. The formation of fatty acyl-CoA is catalyzed in two steps: a stable intermediate of fatty acyl-AMP molecule and then the product is formed‚Äîfatty acid acyl-CoA molecule. Fatty acyl CoA synthetase catalyzes the activation of a long fatty acid chain to a fatty acyl CoA, requiring the energy of 1 ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate. This step uses 2 \\"ATP equivalents\\" because pyrophosphate is cleaved into 2 molecules of inorganic phosphate, breaking a high-energy phosphate bond.  Mechanism and active site  The mechanism for Long Chain Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase is a ‚Äúbi uni uni bi ping-pong‚Äù mechanism. The uni and bi prefixes refer to the number of substrates that enter the enzyme and the number of products that leave the enzyme; bi describes a situation where two substrates enter the enzyme at the same time. Ping-pong signifies that a product is released before another substrate can bind to the enzyme. In step one, ATP and a long chain fatty acid enter the enzyme‚Äôs active site. Within the active site the negatively charged oxygen on the fatty acid attacks the alpha phosphate on ATP, forming an ATP- long chain fatty acid intermediate. (Step 1, Figure 3) In the second step, Pyrophosphate (PPi) leaves, resulting in an AMP-long chain fatty acid molecule within the enzyme‚Äôs active site. (Step 2, Figure 3) Coenzyme A now enters the enzyme and another intermediate is formed which consists of AMP-long chain fatty acid-Coenzyme A. (Step 3, Figure 3) At the end of this mechanism two products are released, AMP and acyl coa synthetase. (Step 4, Figure 3) Acyl CoA is formed from long chain fatty acids through an acyl substitution. In an ATP dependent reaction, the fatty acid carboxylate is converted to a thioester. The final products of this reaction are acyl-CoA, pyrophosphate (PPi) and AMP. Figure 2. Long chain Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase asymmetric unit showing active site residues Trp 234, Tyr504, and Glu540, along with the potentially supporting Asn450 residue.  Structure  There are several highly conserved areas and a 20-30% amino acid sequence similarity between the members of this superfamily. The enzymes in the family consist of a large N-terminal and a small C-terminal domain, with the catalytic site positioned between the two domains. Substrate binding may affect the relative positions of the C- and N-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain of LC-FACS is assumed to be in an open conformation when a substrate is absent and in a closed conformation when a substrate is bound. The accessibility of the active site to solvent is reduced when the C- and N-terminal domains approach one another. The structure-function relationship between LC-FACS and the formation and processing of the acyl-AMP intermediate was still unclear. A domain swapped dimer is formed by LC-FACS, with monomer interacting at the N-terminal domains. A large electrostatically positive concave is located at the back of the structure in the central valley of the homodimer. Asp15 forms an intermolecular salt bridge with Arg176 in the dimer interactions. An intermolecular hydrogen bond is formed between the main chain carbonyl group of Glu16and the side chain of Arg199. At the interface, Glu175 forms an intermolecular salt bridge with Arg199. The L motif, a six-amino acid peptide linker, connects the large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain of each LC-FACS monomer. The N-terminal domain is composed of two subdomains: a distorted antiparallel Œ≤-barrel and two Œ≤-sheets surrounded by Œ±-helices forming an Œ±Œ≤Œ±Œ≤Œ± sandwich. The small C-terminal globular domain consists of two-stranded Œ≤-sheet and a three-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet flanked by three Œ±-helices. = Dimer interaction = Figure 4. Dimerization of LC-FACS. The dimerization of LC-FACS is stabilized through a salt bridge between Asp15 of sequence A and Arg176 of sequence B. Figure 4 shows this salt bridge between these two amino acids. The yellow line between Asp15 and Arg176 shows the salt bridge present. = ATP binding to the C-terminal domain = The conformations of the C-teriminal domain of the LC-FACS structures are dependent on the presence of a ligand. AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, bound to LC-FACS results in the closed conformation with the C- and N-terminal domains directly interacting. In crystal structures, AMP-PNP is bound in a crevasse of each monomer at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains. The closed conformation of the C-terminal domain is retained with myristroyl-AMP. Three residues in the C-terminal domain, Glu443, Glu475, and Lys527, interact noncovalently with L motif residues and the N-terminal domain to stabilize the closed conformation. There are two types of open conformations in the C-terminal domains of the uncomplexed structure. The C- and N-terminal domains do not interact directly for both monomers of the dimer. An extensive hydrogen bond network is used by the AMP moiety of the bound ATP molecule to hold the C- and N-terminal domains together. Figure 5. Active site of long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase with a long chain fatty acid. Trp444, Lys435 and Lys439 are the important residues = Fatty acid- binding tunnel = Bulkier long chain fatty acids are bound by a fatty acid- binding tunnel that is located in the N-terminal domain of each monomer. A large Œ≤-sheet and an Œ±-helix cluster surround the tunnel which extends from the concave cavity in the central valley to the site of ATP-binding. There are two distinct paths in the large central pathway of the tunnel in the complex structure, which includes the ‚ÄúATP path‚Äù and the ‚Äúcenter path,‚Äù separated by the indole ring of Trp234 in the G motif. There is also another branch of the central pathway known as the ‚Äúdead and branch.‚Äù The indole ring of Trp234 closes the fatty acid-binding tunnel in the uncomplexed structure. It opens up once AMP-PNP binds through hydrogen bond formation between Œ≤-phosphate and the nitrogen on the ring of Trp234. During this time, the closed conformation is adopted by the mobile C-terminal domain. There is a shift in the flexible loop of the G motif in the closed structures of LC-FACS, resulting in a wider dead end branch compared to the uncomplexed forms. The ATP binding site is connected to an ATP path that is a hydrophobic channel in the fatty acid- binding tunnel. The fatty acid enters through the center path extending from the interface of the dimer along Œ≤-strand 13 to the ATP path. The connection between the two paths is blocked by the indole ring of Trp234 in the absence of ATP. Water molecules fill the center path in the AMP-PNP and myristoyl-AMP complex structures and through the entrance of the center path, they connect to the bulk solvent regions. The basic residues from each monomer, Lys219, Arg296, Arg297, Arg321, Lys350, and Lys 354, cause the entrance of the center path to generate a positive electrostatic potential. The dead end branch contains residues 235-243 and extends from the fatty acid-binding tunnel to Œ±-helix h. The bottom of the dead end branch consists of a hydrophilic environment from the water molecules and polar side chains. = Domains = Figure 6. Figure 7. The domains founds in Long chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase are shown both in the enzyme view (figure 6) and sequence view (figure 7). LC- FACS has five domains. After searching 1v26 in Entrez, the location of the 5 domains was shown and was used to create figure 6 and 7. The ribbons colors in figure 6 correspond to the colors of the figure 7.  Inhibition by long chain fatty acyl-CoAs  A long term and short term regulation controls fatty acid synthesis. Long term fatty acid synthesis regulation is dependent on the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) synthesis, the rate-limiting enzyme and first enzyme of the fatty acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthase (FAS), the second and major enzyme of the fatty acid synthesis. Cellular fatty acyl-CoA is involved in the short term regulation, but there is not a full understanding of the mechanisms. Free fatty acids inhibits the de novo fatty acid synthesis and appears to be dependent on the formation of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Studies have shown that long chain fatty acyl-CoAs inhibit ACC and FAS via feedback inhibition. Long chain fatty acyl-CoA‚Äôs inhibitory effect on the fatty acid synthesis may be a result of its regulation of lipogenic enzymes in a feedback manner through gene transcription suppression. Long-chain fatty- acid-CoA ligase in cells catalytically synthesizes long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Long-chain fatty-acid-CoA ligase may be involved in an important role in the suppression of fatty acid synthesis and it has been reported that it played a part in fatty acid synthesis inhibition. It was recently found that vitamin D3 upregulates FACL3, which forms long-chain fatty acid synthesis through the use of myristic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid as substrates, in expression and activity levels. FACL3 contributes to vitamin D3 growth inhibitory effect in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. A current study reports that the feedback inhibition of FAS expression by long chain fatty acyl-CoAs causes the downregulation of FAS mRNA by vitamin D3.  Clinical significance  Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), is the build up of long chain fatty acids in the brain and adrenal cortex, because of the decreased activity of long chain fatty acyl coa synthetase. The oxidation of the long chain fatty acids normally occurs in the peroxisome where the long chain fatty acyl coa synthetase is found. Long chain fatty acids enter the peroxisome via a transporter protein, ALDP, which creates a gate in the membrane of the peroxisome. In ALD the gene for this peroximal membrane transporter, ALDP, is defective, preventing long chain fatty acids from entering the peroxisome.

A noted constitutionalist and law professor, he served in the Supreme Court for 18 years, including 6 years as Chief Justice. Early career Fernando was born in Malate, Manila. He obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of the Philippines College of Law, graduating magna cum laude in 1938. He was a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity. Shortly after admission to the bar, he joined the faculty of his alma mater, where he taught as a full-time member of the faculty until 1953, and as a professorial lecturer for decades afterwards. He was eventually appointed as the George A. Malcolm Professor of Constitutional Law. Later, he would also teach constitutional law at the Lyceum of the Philippines. Fernando was feared for his rather tyrannical manner in the classroom, yet many of his law students would emerge as Supreme Court justices or prominent practitioners in their own right. In 1947, he was admitted by the Yale Law School as the first Filipino Sterling Fellow, earning his Master of Law degree the following year. Fernando was appointed as a Code Commissioner in 1953 and served in that capacity until 1964. In the 1950s, he served as a Presidential adviser to Presidents Ramon Magsaysay and Carlos P. Garcia. He likewise engaged in an extensive private practice prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court. Among his law partners was Senator Lorenzo Ta√±ada, with whom he would co-author a popular hornbook on constitutional law. In his lifetime, Fernando would author several books on constitutional and administrative law. Supreme Court years In 1966, Fernando was appointed as Presidential Legal Counsel by Ferdinand Marcos. The following year, he was named as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court by Marcos appointed. If not for the death of Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro in 1979, Fernando would have had the opportunity to become the Chief Justice only in 1984, after Castro reached the mandatory retirement age of 70, and serving for only 1 year until his own retirement. However, Castro died suddenly of a heart attack on April 19, 1979, and Fernando, by then the most senior of the Associate Justices, was promoted by Marcos as Chief Justice. =Jurisprudence= At the time of his appointment to the Court, Fernando was already recognized as one of the country's leading authorities on constitutional law, and as an ardent civil libertarian and active member of the Civil Liberties Union founded by his colleague on the Court, J.B.L. Reyes. He was especially noted for his mastery of American jurisprudence on republicanism and individual rights. He would have ample opportunity to expound on these subjects during his 17-year tenure on the Court. In Morfe v. Mutuc, 130 Phil. 415 (1968), Fernando wrote for the Court that an anti-graft law requiring the periodic submission by public officials of their statements of assets and liabilities did not infringe on the officer's right to liberty under the due process clause, or on the right to privacy. Nonetheless, Morfe marked the first time the Philippine Supreme Court recognized the existence of a constitutional right to privacy as \\"accorded recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it is fully deserving of constitutional protection.\\" The then-recent United States Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) was favorably cited. Fernando was also a persistent proponent of the clear and present danger test as the only acceptable limitation on the right to free expression, as expressed in his ponencia in Gonzales v. COMELEC, 137 Phil. 471 (1969), and his dissent in Badoy v. Ferrer, 35 SCRA 285 (1970). =Controversies= Along with Claudio Teehankee, Sr., Fernando was the longest serving of the Justices appointed during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos. However, unlike Teehankee who progressively became a consistent dissenter to the martial-law rule of Marcos, Fernando frequently voted to affirm challenged acts of the martial law regime. Even though Fernando often qualified his opinions to voice concerns about potential violations of the Bill of Rights, his voting record, as well as his relatively lengthy tenure as Chief Justice during martial law tied him closely with the Marcos regime, and to a Supreme Court perceived as a \\"lackey of Malaca√±ang\\". This reputation was further enhanced when Fernando was photographed holding an umbrella to the then First Lady Imelda Marcos, a seeming act of chivalry many considered it inappropriate for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Critically, Justice Isagani Cruz observed that \\"as Chief Justice, Fernando emphasized that one of the important functions of the judiciary was the 'legitimizing' function. This was to be the stand-by excuse of the Court under him whenever it had to sustain the acts of President Marcos.\\" In 1982, controversy arose after reports that in the bar examinations held that year, the test booklets had been rechecked in order to confer a passing grade to the son of one of the Justices who had initially flunked. The rechecking was reportedly permitted by Fernando. Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera complained of the action, and the story broke in the media. As a result, all the members of the Court, including Fernando, submitted their resignations to President Marcos, who later rejected all but two of the resignations. Shortly after the murder of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1983, Marcos named Fernando to head a fact-finding commission tasked with investigating the assassination. The appointment drew controversy due to concerns that the it violated the constitutional separation of powers, and also out of concerns that a commission headed by a man so closely identified to the Marcos regime would not be sufficiently independent. Fernando promptly resigned, and retired Court of Appeals Justice Corazon Agrava was appointed to head what became known as the Agrava Fact Finding Commission. Chief Justice Fernando is interred at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Later years Fernando's lengthy service in the Court ended in 1985, when he reached the compulsory retirement age of 70. Marcos would be toppled from power the following year, and Fernando's most prominent rival Teehankee would be named Chief Justice by Corazon Aquino. Fernando remained in active practice until shortly before his death at the age 89 in 2004. His expertise as amicus curiae was sought by the Court in the controversial case of Manila Prince Hotel v. GSIS, 267 SCRA 408 (1997). Fernando is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007, it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, the Nintendo DS (with the help of Q Entertainment), Windows Mobile, iOS, Zeebo, and Android; the game has also been ported as a Java application, and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. A sequel was released in September 2008, titled Peggle Nights. PopCap, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts, announced Peggle 2 at E3 2013. Inspired by pachinko and bagatelle, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon \\"Peggle Masters\\" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box, and has since been downloaded over 50 million times. Both its release on Xbox Live Arcade and iOS have had similar success. Gameplay Screenshot of a typical Peggle level in the Xbox Live Arcade's \\"Peg Party\\" mode. Within the game's main \\"Adventure\\" mode, Peggle is divided into fifty-five levels. Each level features an arrangement of approximately one hundred blue \\"pegs\\", positioned to correspond with the level's background picture, inside of three walls on the top and sides (leaving the bottom opened), along with other fixed and moving features. The goal of each level is to clear the board of the twenty-five random pegs that are turned orange at the start of the level, by using a ball launcher located at the top center of the screen to strike one or more of the pegs. Pegs light up when hit, and once the ball either falls through the bottom of the screen or is caught by the ball catcher that moves back and forth along the bottom in a fixed manner, the pegs will be removed. Struck pegs are also removed if the ball is stuck on them. The player begins each level with ten balls (twelve on the non-Touch iPod version) to clear the orange pegs, but may earn more by landing the ball in the ball catcher, or by earning high scores on single shots. Failure to clear the board with the allotted number of balls will require the player to restart the level, while completing this objective will allow the player to progress forward to the next board. Every five levels in the Adventure mode correspond to playing with one of ten \\"Peggle Masters\\", cartoon characters that help the player. Each of the Peggle Masters has a unique special ability that is activated when the player strikes one of the two randomly selected green pegs on the board. Some abilities activate immediately; one ability causes a second ball to be generated from the green peg when struck. Other abilities will have effects that activate on the next shot or for several more shots; one ability shows the ball's path including rebounds, while another will extend the length of the ball catcher. In the final five levels of the Adventure mode, called \\"Master\\" levels, the player can select which of the Peggle Masters they want to use. In addition to clearing the board, the player is challenged to get high scores with each shot. Points come from two main sources: striking pegs, and style points. Each struck peg earns points, with further bonuses gained by hitting numerous pegs on a single shot, and by clearing orange pegs, which builds up a scoring multiplier up to 10x when all but a few orange pegs remain. Additionally, for each shot, one random blue peg will be marked purple and revert to blue after the shot if it is not struck; striking this peg will further boost the player's score. Style points are awarded for making difficult shots such as striking two orange pegs consecutively that are a distance apart, or by getting lucky bounces off the ball catcher. When the player clears the board of orange pegs, as announced by the song \\"Ode To Joy\\" and the message \\"Extreme Fever\\", the bottom of the level is replaced with five bins of different point values that the ball will fall into. The player is awarded this score in addition to any unused balls remaining to get their final score for the level. If all the pegs on a level are cleared, a bonus is awarded and all the bins turn to the maximum value and the message \\"Ultra Extreme Fever\\" is displayed. In addition to the Adventure mode, the game features a series of challenges that require the player to complete boards under stricter requirements, such as having to clear more orange pegs or remove every peg from the board. A \\"Duel\\" mode allows the player to compete against another person or a computer AI on the same board in attempting to reach the highest score. Since the player typically can't predict any patterns, duel mode requires a lot of skill to master. The Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions add a \\"Peg Party\\" mode, in which up to four players compete on their own boards using a limited number of balls, each attempting to get the highest score. In each of these modes, the game generally offers the ability for players to select which Peggle Master they wish to use. Development Peggle was originally envisioned by PopCap's studio director, Sukhbir Sidhu, who was inspired by pachinko machines. However, he recognized that pachinko was mostly luck-based, and would not translate well into a video game. After seeing a 2D game engine created by PopCap programmer Brian Rothstein, Sidhu was able to realize his game, and worked with Rothstein for the first five months of its development before bringing in additional programmers. Initial designs focused on bringing together elements of pachinko with Breakout. The team initially incorporated a \\"rapid-fire\\" mechanic used in pachinko, along with numerous moving targets, but they found this made the levels either too fast-paced or too demanding of the player. They found over time that a static field of pegs provided a more enjoyable experience for the player; the path of the ball would be more predictable, leading to the gameplay mechanic of requiring only a random subset of orange pegs to be cleared. Once the team had established the core mechanics of the game, they brought on character artist Walter Wilson, background artist Marcia Broderick and an additional coder, Eric Tams, to help complete Peggle within its two-year development period. Even with their game established, Sidhu and Rothstein faced internal challenges at PopCap to increase the level of interactivity with the game, but the two defended their vision of the game. The design team struggled with a theme for the game, and for a while the game was based around the mythological god Thor. During this time the game was called Thunderball and was much darker in theme than the final product. Eventually the game changed themes to be more lighthearted and the team realized that the name no longer fit the game. From there the designers came up with calling the game \\"Pego\\" and then \\"Pogo\\". The team later discovered that, since Pogo was already the name of EA's Flash portal they wouldn't be able to use it. Though the game was technically completed within a year, PopCap opted to spend more time to polish it, improving the visuals and background images. The team spent time refining the various sound effects used in the game, in order to provide an appropriate atmosphere. In some cases, they found the desired sound quickly; the sound of the ball hitting a peg was borrowed from another game in development at PopCap, but was considered perfect for Peggle. Other cases required iteration; the sound of the ball shooter was originally closer to that of a cannon, while a \\"plunk\\" sound effect was used when the ball catcher caught a ball. These were changed to more airy sounds (an air cannon and a brief angelic chorus) in order to make the elements sound as if part of the game's music. The team found it helped to create a defining moment at the end of each level when the player is moments from clearing the final peg. This initially was programmed as a simple message stating \\"Extreme Fever\\" and the music of \\"Ode to Joy\\" as a placeholder. Sidhu wanted to recreate the \\"wild sounds and visuals\\" that were present on winning pachinko games. However, the team found that the players reacted well to the simpler placeholder elements, and the team focused on improving the presentation of these, including adding a zoom on the current ball as it neared the last orange peg to be cleared. Versions and sequels Peggle Extreme was packaged with the Windows version of The Orange Box, featuring levels inspired by Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. It includes ten levels with one Peggle Master, and five Challenges. Peggle Extreme was eventually made free to download for anyone with a Steam account. The game was developed in conjunction with Valve after PopCap's Teams learned that Peggle was played often at Valve's offices and that the company had helped to promote the game on Steam. PopCap proposed a version that would pay tribute to Valve's games, which Valve readily warmed up to, helping PopCap with its development, including providing graphical assets and artwork. Peggle has been ported to Xbox Live Arcade, the PlayStation Network, the iPod, and iOS. The Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions includes the \\"Peg Party\\" mode in which up to four players can compete simultaneously. Both the Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and iOS versions include the \\"Duel\\" mode, with the iOS version having the players share the iPhone between turns. Peggle has also been ported as a minigame inside World of Warcraft, featuring levels based on the game, though including a limited set of Peggle Masters to use. Warcraft players can also use Peggle to decide how to distribute loot from successful raids or dungeons. Subsequently, in July 2009, a free standalone, ten-level edition of Peggle themed around Warcraft in a similar manner as Peggle Extreme was released. PopCap released a sequel to the original game, Peggle Nights, in September 2008 for Windows. The sequel expands upon Peggle by adding one new Peggle Master in addition to new levels and challenges. The Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions of Peggle received Nights as a downloadable expansion to the game on November 19, 2009. Peggle Nights was made available as an in-app purchase for iOS devices. Peggle: Dual Shot is a Nintendo DS port of the game, developed by Q Entertainment; the game includes content from both Peggle and Peggle Nights. This version of the game awards the player a star each time a purple bonus peg is hit, activating a new bonus minigame upon collecting five stars. The minigame requires that the player continually bounce a ball with pinball-like bumpers to collect diamonds and extra balls. In 2013, PopCap Games announced Peggle 2 at the E3 2013 expo. A year later, Peggle Blast was announced for mobile devices. Reception Peggle was well received by critics. Alec Meer of Eurogamer found the game to be a \\"constant series of rewards\\" in gameplay, graphics, and audio that would continue to satisfy the player. Gus Mastrapa of The A.V. Club considered the game \\"comfort food for the omnivorous gamer\\", with its ability to draw even hardcore gamers into its fantasy visuals. IGN's Erik Brudvig cited Peggle as being \\"simple enough for anybody to pick up and instantly start having fun\\". The Xbox Live version was seen as truthful to the PC version, and while the Peggle Party mode was considered an interesting addition, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer felt it was a \\"curiously remote approach\\" that did not fully integrate a multiplayer experience into the game, a point also stated by Mastrapa who lamented the lack of online leaderboards. The game did not initially perform well in sales when released for Windows, but according to Sidhu, sales of the game took off following the release of Peggle Extreme as part of The Orange Box; Sidhu stated that the special version of the game helped to bring in video game players that would \\"never be caught dead playing a game with unicorns and rainbows\\". Peggle (both trial and full versions) has been downloaded more than 50 million times from the Internet as of early 2009, though PopCap has not released how many of these downloads were for full sales of the game. Upon its release on Xbox Live Arcade, Peggle was the top-selling game on the service for two weeks, and remained in the top ten applications for several weeks afterward. Within a month, over 100,000 players were listed on the Xbox leaderboards for Peggle, though this number also includes players who purchased the game through the PopCap Arcade Volume 2 retail package, which contained the game as well. IGN editor Cam Shea ranked it eighth on his top ten list of Xbox Live Arcade games. He stated that while its theme could easily turn players off, they should not let it, as it is \\"It's infectious, and most importantly, fun\\" according to him. In a list compiled by the IGN staff in September 2010, Peggle was listed as the 10th best Xbox Live Arcade of all time. The release of Peggle on iOS was extremely popular, placing in the top ten applications purchased through the App Store for the first two weeks it was available. During a weekend in June 2009, the title was put on sale for $1 (normally $5); the sale caused the game to become the most purchased application in the App Store. A PopCap representative stated that they made as many sales during this four-day period as they had in the three weeks prior, after the game's launch on the Store. Peggle is considered by some critics to be an addictive game, with Forbes noting that it entices the user to play \\"just a few more minutes\\". MSNBC named Peggle one of the \\"Top 5 most addictive computer games of all time.\\". PopCap funded a study at East Carolina University which found that Peggle players experienced a \\"45% decrease in depression\\" in individuals under the age of 25. Rock Paper Shotgun interpreted the same study more imaginatively, reporting: \\"Peggle was clear champ, improving the total ‚Äòmood‚Äô by 573% across all study subjects\\". Peggle along with other PopCap games were also found to help children with ADHD improve their attention span and memory recall, in a survey done by Information Solutions Group on behalf of PopCap. Peggle was nominated for the 2007 Game Developers Choice Awards for \\"Best Downloadable Game\\", \\"Best Handheld Game\\" (for the iPod port), and \\"Innovation\\" awards. The game was also nominated as the \\"Best Downloadable Game\\" for the 2007 Interactive Achievement Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Peggle appeared as #40 on the 2007 PC Gamer Magazine (UK) list of their 100 favorite computer games of all time.

Two months later, her body was discovered outside an abandoned house where an anonymous caller had directed her mother. Two male suspects were arrested; they were convicted in 2006 of having kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered Moore. While attending college, the young immigrant from Guyana was living at home with her parents and relatives. The two men were sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder and other charges related to Moore, with an additional 22 years for their escape attempt in January 2006 during the trial. In a separate trial during this period, the two suspects were also convicted of having abducted and raped a 15-year-old girl in 2003 soon after Moore's murder. The girl had escaped from them and gone to police. Her report contributed to their apprehension in the Moore case. In 2008, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael filed a suit in federal district court against the New York Police Department (NYPD), charging its officials with racial bias in how they handled cases of missing persons; the suit was accepted for trial. Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's treatment of her daughter's case with that of a white rare book dealer from the Upper West Side who disappeared about the same time. In August 2014, the federal judge dismissed the case, saying there was no evidence of systemic racial bias within the department on this issue. Background  Born in Guyana, Moore immigrated with her parents to New York City, where they settled in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Relatives from Guyana also lived there. After attending local schools, Moore entered Hunter College. A responsible high achiever, in 2003 she was a third-year psychology honors student. Disappearance and murder Moore was last seen by her family when she left home on April 24 at approximately 7:30 p.m. to meet a friend. She left the friend around 9:00 p.m., saying she was going to eat at a Burger King restaurant at Church and Remsen avenues. Moore apparently never reached the restaurant, and was not seen again by family or friends. When Moore's mother reported her missing the next day, the police said that perhaps the girl was with friends, declining to open the case despite the mother's protests about knowing her daughter's habits. The family posted their own photos and fliers in the neighborhood, hoping to gain information about Romona's disappearance. The police did not open a case on the missing young woman until April 28. In addition to their downplaying family concern when the student disappeared, the initial police reports about her murder mistakenly spelled Moore's first name as \\"Ramona.\\" About the same time as Moore's disappearance, police in Manhattan were publicizing their investigation of the disappearance of Svetlana Aronov, a rare book dealer reported missing by her husband. They held a press conference and displayed a large photo of the missing woman to make the public aware. Aronov's body was found drowned in the East River a few months later. Several days after Moore's disappearance, a 15-year-old girl in Brooklyn reported to police that she had been abducted by two men and taken to an empty house where she was raped by them. She escaped and contacted authorities. About two months after Moore disappeared, her mother Ellie Carmichael received an anonymous phone call, telling her to go to an address on King's Highway. The police have not identified the caller. The mother contacted police, and officers from the 67th Precinct and Emergency Service Units searched the premises of an abandoned, burned house. They discovered Moore's nude body outside, wrapped in a blanket. Police sources said that the young woman had been beaten severely about her head and chest. The basement had been flooded in an apparent attempt to destroy forensic evidence. Trial and details Two male suspects were arrested in the Moore case, in part aided by the report of the 15-year-old girl they had attacked. In 2004 the Brooklyn DA was reported to be seeking the death penalty against the two defendants, who were indicted on five counts of 1st-degree murder, among other charges, for allegedly kidnapping, raping and murdering Romona Moore, 21. They faced separate charges for their attack on the 15-year-old. The details of Moore's kidnapping, captivity, and murder were recounted in the prosecutor's opening statement at the trial, which started on January 18, 2006: > Prosecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi said two thugs terrorized Romona Moore for > days in a Brooklyn basement in April 2003, repeatedly raping her and > attacking her with a knife, a saw, a hammer and a barbell. Defendants Troy > Hendrix, 22, and Kayson Pearson, 23, are also charged with kidnapping and > raping a 15-year-old girl days after they allegedly killed Moore. \\"Romona > Moore's injuries are indescribable,' said Nicolazzi. \\"The horror she > endured, the torture she endured will become clear.\\" Additional details were revealed in testimony about evidence. = Witness testimony = Romando Jack, a friend of Hendrix and Pearson, testified to seeing Moore chained and held as a captive by Pearson and Hendrix in the basement of a house but at the time did not report this to the police; he went to a baby shower and later returned home to Maryland. Jack told his fianc√©e and her uncle about the young woman being abused and held captive. He said during the trial that he thought his uncle may have called the police. A female witness testified in court, but changed her testimony three times. She said she had also suffered sexual abuse and beatings. = Escape attempt and mistrial= The courtroom was thrown into chaos on January 19, 2006, when defendant Pearson stabbed his attorney on his way out of the courtroom. Defendant Hendrix jumped a barricade and tried to take a gun from one of the bailiffs, in order to make their escape. Both men were subdued by officers. The two men were charged with \\"assault, resisting arrest and attempted escape.\\" The judge declared a mistrial due to Pearson's attack on his lawyer in the courtroom. New charges were brought against the two defendants for their attack, and a new trial was quickly scheduled. Main trial A second kidnapping and murder trial was begun. On March 23, 2006, the district attorney announced the jury conviction of Hendrix and Pearson on charges of kidnapping, rape, torture and first-degree murder of Romona Moore, 21.Michael Brick, \\"2 Guilty in 2003 Killing of College Student\\", New York Times, 24 March 2006, accessed 1 April 2016 They were reputedly members of the Bloods gang. After the verdict was announced, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael spoke to the press in front of TV cameras; she said she had received justice inside the courtroom if not outside, and strongly criticized press and police for their conduct since her daughter's disappearance and murder. She said, \\"All I got was nothing but disrespect from the media and the police.\\" =Sentencing= On April 11, 2006, Pearson and Hendrix were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. They received an additional 22 years for their attacks in the court while seeking escape. Mother files bias lawsuit against NYPD As Moore's family awaited sentencing of the convicted defendants, their daughter's case was superseded by media attention related to the announcement of a grand jury indictment across the street in another courtroom in the abduction and murder of Imette St. Guillen, a graduate student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who had lived on the Upper West Side. She had also been tortured and raped before her death. Moore's family felt that in 2003, when their daughter disappeared, neither the police nor the press took her case seriously. They did not search as hard for her as for Svetlana Aronov, a white art rare book dealer who had disappeared in Manhattan at about the same time, nor did they have a press conference to call attention to the honor student's disappearance. The Moore relatives initially had posted fliers in their neighborhood when the police declined to open an investigation, saying that sometimes young people took off for a few days. It turned out that Moore was still alive and subject to torture when the police closed her case. The police have said that other circumstances in the Moore and Aronov cases were different. Following the conclusion of the trial of the murderers of her daughter, on April 3, 2008, Moore's mother Elle Carmichael filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging that they did not take sufficient action in cases of missing black women and girls. The historic racial-bias lawsuit was cleared for trial by Brooklyn Federal District Judge Nina Gershon. Carmichael is claiming that NYPD \\"used a double standard\\" by not mounting a vigorous search for Moore while \\"aggressively pursuing the disappearance of white women.\\" The police at the 67th Precinct had rejected Carmichael's initial request to search for her daughter by saying that \\"she was probably off with a boyfriend.\\" Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's actions in failing to investigate the disappearance of her daughter with their pursuit of evidence in the case of Svetlana Aronov, a white woman. City Attorney Robyn Pullio indicated that she was looking forward to a hearing in this case so that all facts could be heard. In August 2014, Federal District Judge Nina Gershon dismissed Carmichael's bias case, ruling that there was no evidence to show there was \\"a widespread, racially-motivated practice within the NYPD of delays in listing minorities missing or investigating the circumstances.\\" She acknowledged there could be differences among specific cases, but said systemic bias was not shown.John Marzulli, \\"EXCLUSIVE: Judge nixes claim of racial bias in search for missing woman found dead in 2003\\", New York Daily News, 4 August 2014, accessed 2 April 2016 Representation in the media The ABC television series NYPD 24/7 in 2004 featured a seven-episode, weekly series about the police, with extensive coverage by film crews to convey the truth of the officers' jobs. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly in the Mayor Michael Bloomberg administration agreed to have the fabled department filmed. A total of 2,000 hours of film was shot over 16 months for the series. The July 13, 2004 episode featured unfolding elements of the earlier Romona Moore investigation.

The term refers to those who have lapsed or fallen away from their faith, only to return to it later.  Origins  The Decian persecution of 250 AD, which required all citizens of the Roman empire to publicly sacrifice to traditional gods, created unrest within the Church. Christians who submitted to pressure and made public sacrifice were called lapsed or \\"lapsi\\". Upon completion of sacrifice, individuals received a certificate of sacrifice, or libellus, a legal document proving conformity with Roman religion. To avoid this test, many members of the clergy fled, leaving their communities without leadership. In their absence, lay people who had not lapsed, called confessors, filled their leadership role. Upon return to Carthage, St. Cyprian found these confessors had assumed authority of clergy, especially forgiveness of sin. Although many confessors willingly relinquished their positions of authority upon the clergies' return, some attempted to retain their positions. Cyprian called a council in 251 AD to address this problem, the root of which was the status of the lapsi. Confessors tended to accept lapsi back into communion, while the clergy demanded harsher punishments. Cyprian was able to avoid schism by identifying five categories of lapsi and assigning penance appropriate to each. Classifications After the 250 AD Decian Persecution, Cyprian of Carthage held a council sometime after Easter 251 AD, in which Lapsi were classified into five categories: * Sacrificati: Those who had actually offered a sacrifice to the idols. Christians that made sacrifices, especially to Roman gods, were only offered absolution on their deathbeds. * Thurificati: Those who had burnt incense on the altar before the statues of the gods. From Latin thurificare - \\"burn incense\\" * Libellatici: Those who had drawn up attestation (libellus), or had, by bribing the authorities, caused such certificates to be drawn up for them, representing them as having offered sacrifice, without, however, having actually done so. A two-year sanction was imposed as penance. From Latin libellus - \\"little book; letter; certificate\\" * Acta facientes: Those that made false statements or other acts to save their lives. From Latin - \\"those doing the acts\\" * Traditores: Those who gave up sacred scriptures, artifacts and/or revealed names of fellow Christians. From Latin tradere - \\"hand over; deliver; betray\\" (source of the English \\"traitor‚Äù).

Over the years, the castle has undergone several wars and suffered some damage, but it has been constantly renovated. Today, it is one of the best preserved medieval castles in Central Europe.  The Schattenburg museum  The museum offers a total of eighteen museum rooms on three floors. Each room is dedicated to a different aspect of Feldkirch's city history and leads visitors back in time. Weapons from the Middle Ages to the World War II are on display in the castle guard. In 2017 more than 30,000 people mentioned the museum. The castle houses a restaurant next to the museum.

It supported Intel's 486 chip, a 32-bit bus, RAID disk and dual-processor support well before its main rivals. Innovative features The SystemPro, along with the simultaneously released Compaq Deskpro 486, was one of the first two commercially available computer systems containing the new EISA bus. The SystemPro was also one of the first PC-style systems specifically designed as a network server, and as such was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the EISA bus. It included such features as multiprocessing (the original systems were asymmetric-only), hardware RAID, and bus-mastering network cards. All models of SystemPro used a full-height tower configuration, with eight internal hard drive bays. =Multiprocessing= CPU-board closeup At its initial release in November 1989, the SystemPro supported up to two 33 MHz 386 processors, but early in 1990 33 MHz 486 processors became an option (the processors were housed on proprietary daughterboards). Because the system was asymmetric, 386 and 486 processors could be mixed. Single processor configurations were also available. The only operating system which fully supported the SystemPro's asymmetric multiprocessing was a custom version of SCO Unix, sold by Compaq. However, when running OS/2, certain applications (notably Sybase SQL Server) could be offloaded to the second processor, and later, Novell NetWare SFT-III was able to offload its I/O engine. It is worth noting that the original versions of Windows NT (3.1) included a hardware abstraction layer specifically for the SystemPro; despite NT's symmetric multiprocessing design, this HAL could offload some kernel tasks to the second CPU. This made Windows NT 3.1 the only version of Windows to support multiprocessor 386-based machines. =System/Memory Architecture= The system used a state-of-the-art shared memory bus design, called Tri-Flex Architecture, to facilitate its multiprocessing capabilities. The original SystemPro shipped with 4MB 80ns DRAM, expandable up to 256MB using proprietary memory modules. =RAID= RAID-Controller closeup The SystemPro also offered one of the first implementations of RAID (including RAID 5) available on a PC-based system. The original RAID card, called the IDA (Intelligent Drive Array) used a proprietary form of IDE, supporting up to 4 drives internally. At its release, the largest drive available was 210 MB. Two IDA cards could be installed, allowing all 8 hard drive bays to be filled (each IDA controller array would appear as a separate logical drive to the operating system, however), providing a grand total of 1.2 GB using RAID 5, or 1.6 GB using non-redundant striping (RAID 0). Another option called the IDA Expansion Array provided support for up to 7 drives in a single array (housed in an external tower chassis looking virtually identical to the SystemPro itself), using an early (and very proprietary) form of differential SCSI. Note that all hard drives in the SystemPro or the Expansion Array were internally mounted drives; hot swapping was not an option. Market The SystemPro was marketed for those who had scaled up to the top end of LAN hardware, or those who were scaling down from minicomputers -- and its pricing was set accordingly. At the time of launch, the \\"low-end\\" SystemPro (a single 33-MHz 386 CPU, 4 MB RAM, and two 120-MB hard drives) listed for $15,999 (USD); the same machine with 840 MB of storage (four 210-MB hard drives) listed for $25,999 (USD). A second 386 processor card cost $3,500 (USD), and an additional 32 MB of RAM was $21,999 (USD). Legacy The SystemPro line continued for several years, ending with the SystemPro XL, which was introduced in 1992. The XL was the only model that supported symmetric multiprocessing. It was replaced, also in 1992, by Compaq's ProSignia line, and later the Proliant series, which introduced hot swappable drives and the rack mount chassis now popular in data centers. However, the SystemPro is notable for having established the PC-based server market, and setting a high-water mark for the servers that followed.

In 1888, Gee published the first complete modern description of the clinical picture of coeliac disease, and theorised on the importance of diet in its control. His contribution led to the eponym Gee's disease. Gee is also credited with the first English-language description of cyclic vomiting syndrome. as cited by Life Samuel Gee was born in London, where he spent his medical career. His father, William Gee, was a businessman but the family was not wealthy. He had two years of formal primary education, supplemented by home schooling. His secondary education was at the University College School, London. He went on to study medicine at the University College Hospital, gaining an MB in 1861 followed by an MD in 1865. Gee initially worked as a house surgeon at the University College Hospital. He moved to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street in 1865. His career progressed through house surgeon, assistant physician (1866), physician (1875) and finally consulting physician (1904). He worked at both Great Ormond Street Hospital, at St Bartholomew's Hospital and in private practice. At St Bartholomew's medical school, he was a demonstrator of morbid anatomy, lecturer on pathological anatomy and lecturer on medicine. He delivered the 1871 Goulstonian, the 1892 Bradshaw and the 1899 Lumleian Lectures. Gee was married to Sarah Cooper in 1875 with whom he had two daughters. He died suddenly, of a coronary occlusion, while on holiday in Keswick, Cumbria. Celiac disease Samuel Gee gave the first modern-day description of coeliac disease in a lecture at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street in 1887. His interest in the history of medicine, and ability to read ancient Greek, meant Gee was familiar with the work of Aretaeus of Cappadocia who first wrote of \\"The C≈ìliac Affection\\". Gee's account is published in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports of 1888 and begins: > There is a kind of chronic indigestion which is met with in persons of all > ages, yet is especially apt to affect children between one a five years old. > Signs of the disease are yielded by the f√¶ces; being loose, not formed, but > not watery; more bulky than the food taken would seem to account for; pale > in colour, as if devoid of bile; yeasty, frothy, an appearance probably due > to fermentation; stinking, stench often very great, the food having > undergone putrefaction rather than concoction. Gee acknowledges earlier findings and terms for the disease and adopts the same term as Aretaeus. Unlike Aretaeus, he includes children in the scope of the affection, particularly those between one and five years old. He notes that most adults with the c≈ìliac affection have been abroad. Gee finds the cause to be obscure and fails to spot anything abnormal during post-mortem examination. He perceptively states \\"if the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet.\\" Gee recognises that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. He forbids rice, sago, fruit and vegetables. Raw meat is recommended as are thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlights particular success with a child \\"who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch mussels daily\\". However, the child cannot bear this diet for more than one season. The cause of coeliac disease was eventually discovered to be an autoimmune reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat, plus Secalin in rye and Hordien in barley. The lining of the small bowel is flattened, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients. Gee would not have been able to discover this on post-mortem since this lining quickly deteriorates on death. The only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The rice, sago, fruit and vegetables that were forbidden by Gee would all have been quite safe to eat; the toasted bread he recommended, however, would not. The disease he describes in adults, affecting those returning from India and other foreign parts, is likely to have been tropical sprue. For many years this was inadequately distinguished from coeliac disease, which was also known as non-tropical sprue.

Working under her married name, she was part of the team that developed the modern intravenous drip technique.Autumn Stanley, Mothers and Daughters of Invention; Note for a Revised History of Technology, Rutgers University Press, 1995  Early life  Johnstone attended Emma Willard School in Troy, New York. An account from a classmate's journal describes her classmates being awed by Johnstone and her acting career. This admiration led to her classmates nicknaming her Ju-jo. She was active in her school years as she was in the drama club and acted in the senior play; was an active editor of Gargoyle; and a member of the basketball team, glee club, operetta, and the choir. She briefly was a model during her time at Emma Willard as well. Acting career Johnstone appeared in three Broadway shows between 1911 and 1914, and then quit the business to finish high school at the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York. Upon her return to Broadway, she became a favorite performer for producers Charles Dillingham and Florenz Ziegfeld, who featured her in the 1915 and 1916 editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. Lee Shubert created the 1917 Broadway musical revue Over the Top for her, which featured Fred Astaire and his sister Adele Astaire in their Broadway debuts. In 1926, she retired from performing for private life. Johnstone married film producer Walter Wanger on September 13, 1919. They divorced in 1938 and she retained her married name. After her divorce, she adopted two sons. Medical career When Johnstone's husband fell ill in 1927, Johnstone became acquainted with his doctor, Samuel Hirschfeld. He convinced her to enroll in some science courses at Columbia University, where she studied plant research. Her work so impressed Harold T. Hyman, head of the science department of Columbia, that he and Hirschfeld hired her to work with them in their research. She joined the staff of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1929 as a research assistant in the pharmacology department. She co-authored a paper with them concerning the development of the modern I.V. unit. Their key breakthrough was to slow down the rate of delivery and avoid what was then known as \\"speed shock\\" by introducing the now-ubiquitous drip technique. The three also conducted numerous experiments that led to the cure for syphilis. During her time at Columbia, Johnstone co-authored (with a Dr. Blackberg) two other published papers. One dealt with the organization of resuscitation measures; the other with melnauria. Later, Johnstone and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where as a research assistant to physicians she studied cancer and helped develop the discipline of endocrinology. To aid this research, she installed a laboratory in her house in Hollywood. Death Justine Wanger died in Santa Monica, California from congestive heart failure, aged 87. Her remains are at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.  Theatrical productions  * Watch Your Step (1914) as Estelle * Ziegfeld Follies of 1915 (1915) * Stop! Look! Listen!

It is located on 22nd Street (Highway 14), west of Range Road 3063. Transportation 22nd Street (Highway 14) is a major thoroughfare through Saskatoon Highway 14 connects with Asquith, Biggar Wilkie, Unity, and Macklin en route to Alberta. The area is also accessed by Highway 7, which links Saskatoon to Calgary, Alberta and the west coast, and Secondary Highway 684, also known as Dalmeny Road but officially renamed Neault Road in 2012, which was annexed by the city and provides a connection to Yellowhead Highway 16 and the town of Dalmeny. Highway 7 has been realigned to connect with Highway 14/22nd Street/Highway 684 at an at-grade intersection that will be eventually replaced by an interchange. For several years Highway 7 entered the area via Betts Avenue within the Blairmore Suburban Centre region, but this link has now been removed; the road's original alignment where it joined 22nd Street prior to the mid-2000s has been replaced with residential development and the area's recreation centre and high schools. The only other main road currently servicing the SDA is the western leg of 33rd Street West, which according to the City's October 2008 Projected Growth Map is slated to eventually be replaced by an extension of the Claypool Drive thoroughfare; originally an east-west roadway, beginning in 2012 the road was realigned to allow for development of Kensington. The western boundary of the SDA is marked by a transportation/utility corridor adjacent to the current western city boundary, set aside for future construction of a perimeter highway. =City Transit= The Blairmore Suburban Centre is served by Route 23 on weekday peak hours and during the day.

Production shifted to the Mark VII for the tenor and alto in the mid-1970s (see discussion of serial numbers below), and to the Super Action 80 for the soprano and baritone saxophones in 1981. The sopranino saw limited production until about 1985. Selmer debuted the Mark VI in 1954 with sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass saxophones, until the introduction of the Mark VII model in 1975. Since the Mark VI design continued for sopraninos, sopranos, baritones, or bass saxes, they did not have a Mark VII model. There are reports of a limited number of baritone saxophones labeled as Mark VIIs, but these horns were of the same design as the Mark VI. All Mark VI saxophones were manufactured in France. After manufacture, instruments designated for the British/Canadian or American markets were shipped unassembled and unengraved to their respective markets for completion. The style of engraving on the bell of the instrument is an indicator of the place of assembly. Eric Marienthal playing his Selmer Mk VI tenor saxophone Bell of a Selmer Mark VI alto saxophone in the 80,000 serial number range. The French-assembled Mark VI engraving is usually of a butterfly and floral motif, and the engraving typically extends to the bow. Some French- assembled Mark VIs lack any engraving other than the brand stamp. Nickel or silver-plated keys with a lacquer-finish body were offered among the French- assembled horns. The British/Canadian Mark VIs often have a symmetrical medallion engraved on the front of the bell, and a design reminiscent of the chambered nautilus along the sides of the bell. American-assembled Mark VIs have floral or scroll engraving, with only the earliest models extending to the bow. The Mark VI is played by many musicians including Kenny G, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane. The design of the Mark VI evolved over time. Switching over from its predecessor, officially named the Super Action but commonly called the Super Balanced Action, Selmer's earliest Mark VI models were transitional, incorporating design elements from the preceding model. Tonally, early examples are considered to have a \\"dark\\" tone, while later examples are thought of as having a \\"bright\\" sound. The bore taper, bow, neck designs, and some mechanical features changed throughout the history of the Mark VI. The changes were not documented by Selmer. The length of the bow was increased on altos during the 85K serial number range to address certain intonation issues. In subsequent years the short bow was reintroduced. Some altos had baffles soldered into the bow to correct intonation issues. At least three changes to neck design were made on the tenor during the 1950s and 1960s, and once again in the 1970s. Some contend that the neck design changes account for the different tonal and playing qualities between earlier and later Mark VIs. Others contend that Mark VIs produced after about SN 180,000 had harder metal as a result of a change in the metalworking process, however, that SN corresponds to a known change in neck design so differing characteristics before and after can not definitely be ascribed to metallurgy. Latter-year Mark VIs gained a reputation of being lower quality than early versions (possibly due to Selmer's higher annual production output of the popular saxophone), leading to a greater demand of early-year Mark VIs with a five-digit serial number. An employee's description of the assembly and quality control process at Selmer USA during the 1960s indicated that different quality Mark VIs were sold through different channels; the top tier was offered to musicians under contract to Selmer (\\"Selmer Artists\\"), the second tier went to pro dealers in major markets, and the third tier went to the general market. Hence, the best assurance of the quality of a Mark VI may be its sale history, as more variability could be expected in the quality of horns initially sold in the general market. The high F key was offered as an option, though some players believe that instruments without the high F key have better natural intonation. During the mid-1960s optional keywork was offered, including the rare 'Concert' model with a high F#, right hand G#, D to E flat trill key and C to D trill key using the E flat palm key. There are also somewhat rare low A alto and baritone models. The low A baritone is especially sought after, whereas the low A alto model acquired a reputation, rightly or wrongly, for intonation issues. Nonetheless, Ornette Coleman played a low A alto. The quality and ergonomics of the keywork design of the Mark VI can be observed in current saxophone designs: most modern saxophones have keywork that is based upon the basic Mark VI design. Selmer's General Manager Jerome Selmer has confirmed that all Mark VIs were manufactured from industry- standard 66/34 \\"yellow brass\\" stock and that Selmer never recycled shell casings.

There can be as much as an 18-month (+/-) variation in actual production dates. This has been verified by original owners with receipts of their instruments showing purchase dates earlier than they would have been produced according to this chart. An example exists of an 89,000 series instrument sold in 1959. The actual timing of the transition from Mark VI to Mark VII altos and tenors is unclear--Mark VIs exist in the 236,000 (1975) serial number range, contrary to the purported 231,000 Mark VII change-over. One hypothesis is that the announcement of the transition in Selmer's 1974 literature was premature. Another is that Selmer produced both the Mark VI design and early Mark VII horns concurrently, or possibly until the existing parts for the Mark VI were used up. Reported early Mark VII examples have Mark VII keywork on Mark VI type body tubes. The Mark VI Soprano, Baritone, and Bass models were produced from 1954-1981. It is possible to find confirmed examples of these instruments in the serial range of # 55201-365000. The Mark VI Sopranino model was produced from 1954-1985 and can be found within the serial number range of # 55201-378000. The Mark VI was succeeded by the Mark VII, which was produced as alto and tenor saxophones only.

It is also celebrated in American Samoa, Tokelau and Tonga. The day is for parents and communities to acknowledge and celebrate childhood by hosting special programs during church services which include scriptural recitations, biblical story reenactments, and creative dance performances. Children receive gifts (often new clothing and/or school supplies) on White Sunday and are allowed privileges normally reserved for elders, such as being the first to be served food at family meal time. Observance On White Sunday, Samoan women and children dress completely in white clothing. Some of them trim the clothes with the other two colors of the Samoan flag, red and blue. Men will wear white shirts with either white slacks or the traditional 'i.e. faitaga form of the lavalava. If a lavalava is worn it need not be white. Background Some believe White Sunday to be a Christian adaptation of an indigenous pre-contact celebration of certain planting and harvesting seasons. Others assert that the holiday coincides with a family celebration that became widespread in the 1920s in commemoration of Samoans who succumbed to the influenza epidemic of 1919; this epidemic, introduced through the ambivalence of the New Zealand colonial administration, took the lives of 1/5 to 1/4 of the Samoan population, many of them children. White Sunday is a time to also get with brothers, sisters and even cousins to recite something together. It is a tradition in all the Protestant churches. White Sunday (or Childrens' Sunday) was originally practiced by The Congregational Christian Church in Samoa (CCCS) in 1898 (while called London Missionary Society-LMS). During its annual Conference in May 1898 it was resolved to set up a special Sunday for children, and so the first such White Sunday was held on the last Sunday of June the same year 1898, which was celebrated in all the LMS churches in Samoa. During the International Sunday School Conference held in Rome in February 1909, it was resolved to make the 3rd Sunday of October to be the International Childrens Sunday, and so the Samoan White Sunday was likewise changed from June to the 3rd Sunday of October. Later on, this day was changed to the 2nd Sunday of October,(as Mothers' Day on 2nd Sunday May and Fathers' Day on 2nd Sunday August). The centenary 100 years of White Sunday was celebrated in 1998 not only by CCCS churches in Samoa but also in CCCS churches in USA, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa. Today White Sunday is observed and celebrated by all Christian Churches in Samoa. For CCCS churches, most children are baptized on White Sunday. A special service is held on Saturday evening to prepare everyone - minister, children, parents and families for the White Sunday.

A geofact (a portmanteau of \\"geology\\" and \\"artifact\\") is a natural stone formation that is difficult to distinguish from a man-made artifact. Geofacts could be fluvially reworked and be misinterpreted as an artifact, especially when compared to paleolithic artifacts. Some of the proposed criteria for distinguishing geofacts from artifacts for paleolithic specimens resembling debitage have been subjected to evaluation by experimental and actualistic studies. If the artifact has two or more of the following, then the artifact is more than likely to be a geofact. Distinguishing geofacts from lithic debitage, through experiments and comparisons: Possible examples include several purported prominent ancient artifacts, such as the Venus of Berekhat Ram and the Venus of Tan-Tan. These are thought by many in the archaeological community to be geofacts. A site which shows an abundance of what are likely geofacts is the Gulf of Cambay. Geofacts versus artifacts or as British scientists refer ‚Äúartefacts‚Äù are just one of the battles archaeologists go through while excavating a site. In the article, ‚ÄúArtefact-Geofact Analysis of The Lithic Material from The Susiluola Cave,‚Äù by Hans-Peter Schulz (2007) whom explained Geofacts are multi-shaped rocks that can be found while archaeologists are trying to find true artifacts during past glacial periods. Glacial periods such as the Eemian interglacial and the Middle Weichselian glaciation located in the northern parts of the world melted and began to move rocks from their original areas while they scraped everything around them. The rock movement created sometimes weapon like spears from smaller rocks and appear as artifacts but instead are just a product of glacial melting. Another element Schulz explained is the mixing of natural and salt water during the glaciations, which changed sediment locations within rocks such as the Susiluola cave located in Finland. Once the ice melted the sediment and ice created some artificial markings on pebble sized rocks. Some elements that could morph rock shapes in caves include sandstone, siltstone and quartzite creating a kinetic process of shaping the rocks. There are measurements Schulz created to distinguish a geofact such as blow angles from a sandstone or quartzite rock with a limit between 45 and 90 degrees, and if the abrasions were rounded these are considered geofacts.Schulz, P.

(2002, May 8). Artifacts or Geofacts? Alternative Interpretations of Items from the Gulf of Cambay. Intersurf.com, 1-16. Retrieved from http://www.intersurf.com/~chalcedony/geofact.html Artifacts mixed with human remains can certainly contain mixtures of Geofacts. In the article, ‚ÄúThe alleged Early Paleolithic artefacts are in reality geofacts: a revision of the site of Konczyce Weilkie 4 in the Moravian Gate, South Poland,‚Äù Wi≈õniewski et. all. (2014), explain when geofacts are mixed with artifacts in a fluvial gravel pit it becomes very difficult to distinguish between the two. Another issue Wisniewski questioned is if the site was livable during the Paleolithic period because artifacts are mobile and therefore would not be found in situ however, rocks that are native to the area would usually be a geofact. A helpful hint to decide if an item is an artifact or geofact is if there are multiple rocks that have similar edges and shapes and this type of rock is in its natural environment then it is most likely a geofact. An argument the previous excavators claimed was that some rocks were found over 140 meters from their original environment meaning they could have been artifacts moved by humans. However this was quickly refuted because evidence in glacial moraines and fluvial-glacial deposits caused many rocks to move a similar distance from their original environment. Clearly distinguishing geofacts from artifacts is not a simple task however, if excavators stick with the proper requirements and assumptions there will be far less misinterpretations in the future.

The story highlights the racial tensions of African Americans and whites within a South Carolina town and its private school. The production was filmed at Berry College, and is noted for its soundtrack which featured classical choir pieces. It was released on VHS and later on DVD. Plot In 1959, a new teacher named Derek Sanders becomes the new choirmaster for Blanton Academy, a prestigious but all-white private school in South Carolina. Mr. Sanders tries to reduce some of the prejudice and hostility of some of the students in his choir. Paul, a bully who feels he should be lead boy, is the worst offender. Taylor Bradshaw, on the other hand, is impressed by the music of Landy Allen, an African-American boy and grandson of Zeke, the school caretaker. Taylor begins to explore the music and lives of the African- American people who live in Rivertown, despite knowing that it could get him expelled or rejected. Sanders is also impressed by Landy's abilities and attempts to get him involved with the choir. A tragedy in the community brings the race issue to a head.

The privatization effort is primarily backed by reformist members of the Iranian government and society who hope that privatization can bring about economic and social change. In 2007, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei requested that government officials speed up implementation of the policies outlined in the amendment of Article 44, and move towards economic privatization. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights should be protected in courts set up by the Justice Ministry; the hope was that this new protection would give an additional measure of security and encourage private investment. Despite these statements, true official backing for privatization remains very slow due to political reasons. Some 80 percent of the companies subject to Article 44 of the Constitution would be transferred to public ownership, 40 percent of which will be conducted through the \\"Justice Shares\\" Scheme and the rest through the Tehran Stock Exchange. The government will keep the title of the remaining 20 percent. It is widely believed that if current governmental organizations are privatized they will need to become more efficient. At present many are not profitable due to large numbers of unnecessary employees hired by the government to reduce unemployment. Furthermore, many of these companies are subsidized by oil revenues. True privatization will inevitably lead to many unpopular job cuts and large scale lay offs. The current privatization effort calls for an initial public offering (IPO) of five percent of the firms being privatized. Once the five percent is public, it will establish a base market price for future offerings. According to a study conducted by the IMF in 18 countries, privatization adds 2 percent to the government's GDP per annum.Iran Daily ‚Äì Economic Focus ‚Äì 03/14/07  The Iranian constitution  According to the Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution, the economy of Iran is to consist of three sectors: state, cooperative, and private; and is to be based on systematic and sound planning. * The state sector is to include all large- scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals, banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services, aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like; all these will be publicly owned and administered by the State. * The cooperative sector is to include cooperative companies (Bonyad) and enterprises concerned with production and distribution, in urban and rural areas, in accordance with Islamic criteria. * The private sector consists of those activities concerned with construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement the economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors. A strict interpretation of the above has never been enforced in the Islamic Republic and the private sector has been able to play a much larger role than is outlined in the Constitution. In recent years, the role of the private sector has been further on the increase. Furthermore, an amendment of the article in 2004 has allowed 80 percent of state assets to be privatized (ref: Note C, article 44 of Constitution).  Background  = Iranian Revolution and Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1979‚Äì88) = In July 1979, six months after the victory of the Revolution, 28 private banks that held 43.9 percent of the total assets of all the Iranian banks in their possession, were declared nationalized by the government. At the same time, all the car-making, copper, steel and aluminum industries, as well as the assets of 51 capitalists and major industrialists and their next of kin were declared nationalized by the government. In 1982, Mostazafen Foundation of Islamic Revolution alone came to possess 203 manufacturing and industrial factories, 472 big agricultural fields, 101 major construction firms, 238 trade and services companies and 2,786 big plots of real estates. Immediately following the outbreak of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War over 80% of Iran's economy came under the control of the government. This created numerous problems for Iran as previously internationally competitive companies, such as Iran Air or Iran Khodro, degraded into basic domestic companies that could barely function without massive government subsidies ‚Äì primarily derived from oil revenues. = Rafsanjani government (1989‚Äì97) = After the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1988, the Iranian government declared its intention to privatize most state industries in an effort to stimulate the ailing economy. The sale of state-owned factories and companies proceeded slowly, however (mostly because of the opposition in Majlis), and most industries remained state-owned in the early 21st century (70% of the economy as of 2006). The majority of heavy industry‚Äîincluding steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools‚Äîwas in the public sector, while most light industry was privately owned. = Khatami government (1997‚Äì2005) = In 2004, under the presidency of reformist Mohammad Khatami a number of efforts were made to eliminate the role of the government: The Tehran Stock Exchange was re-launched, which allowed a mechanism for trading shares of government companies. Elements of the constitution (article 44) that decreed that core-infrastructure should remain state run were eliminated,Business Day ‚Äì News Worth Knowing and private banks were launched. Despite plans to sell billions worth of state assets to the private sector, uptake was very slow. A common criticism of the privatization effort by investors was the only local Iranian organizations that are capable of buying the large share blocks are themselves government owned. Also analysts have blamed international fears about the Iranian nuclear programme and an absence of transparency and information reporting for the lack of enthusiasm for state assets. In 2005, Iran tried to sell $2.5bn of government assets but only managed to offload less than 30 per cent. At present, at least 20 percent of the companies slated for selloff are officially loss-making. While the rest have earned an average profit of 5.5 percent in recent years, that figure does not take into account the extensive political and economic incentives and monopoly protections that they enjoy. = Ahmadinejad government (2005‚Äì2013) = In July 2006, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei decreed a renewed effort to privatize the economy and said in his order that ‚Äúceding 80 per cent of the shares of large companies will serve to bring about economic development, social justice and the elimination of poverty‚Äù. The decree is also an effort to revive Iran's stalled privatization programme and kick-start the country's many uncompetitive industries, which are heavily protected by subsidies. In February 2008, Iran announced that 3 newly formed Investment Banks (AminIB, Novin and Pasargad Bank) will take share subscriptions and act as an intermediary between the Privatization Organization and the stock exchange, helping Iran divest state-owned enterprises. Close to 370 trillion rials worth of shares of firms covered by Article 44 of the Constitution have been sold to the private sector from 2006 to 2009. The value of government assets are between 1,000 and 1,100 trillion rials ($110 billion), one third of which have been ceded to the private sector (December 2008). In 2009 it was reported that 30 percent of the revenues obtained from ceding the ownership of state entities within the framework of Article 44 of the Constitution are allocated to the nationwide cooperatives.http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3482/html/economy.htm#s400458 As of 2009, Iran has privatized $63 billion worth of government equity in state- owned firms since 2005 (out of $120 billion). Subsequently, the disinvestment has brought the government's direct ownership in the GDP from 80% down to 40%. However, privatization through the Tehran Stock Exchange has tended to involve the sale of state-owned enterprises to other state actors such as pension funds. The Iranian Government announced in 2010 that it aims to raise some $12.5 billion by privatizing more than 500 state-owned firms. The money raised through privatization of the firms will be spent on paying the state's debts. = Rouhani government (2013‚Äì) = Iran's government was due to privatize 27 huge companies, 76 large companies, 31 medium companies, and 31 companies of other sizes in 2014. Huge companies are those companies with the shares value of over 10 trillion rials (about $403 million) and large companies are those with the shares value of over one trillion rials (about $40 million). As of November 2014, the value of shares transferred over the mentioned 1.5 years (about $9.2 billion) is tantamount to the value of shares transferred since the establishment of the organization 12.5 years ago. As of 2016, regarding privatizations conducted by the IPO, 25% of such entities were divested to the Civil Servants Pension Organization, 15% to the Farmers, Villagers and Nomads‚Äô Social Insurance Fund and 25% to the Social Security Organization and only 5% to the \\"real private sector\\". For years it has been the country's position to privatize 80% of all power plants. As of August 17, 2017 Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian has said that 55% of all power plants have completed privatization. The country aims to clinch international contracts in order to aid in attracting much needed investment.  \\"Justice shares\\" plan  The government has approved a plan to offer shares to low-income families, starting with the poorest. Under the ‚ÄúJustice Shares‚Äú plan, millions of Iranian families will receive shares in state-owned firms, the value of which will be reimbursed in 20 years from the dividends generated by those shares. The project is in line with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election promise to improve the condition of Iran's poor. Ahmadinejad in July 2005 promised to distribute shares to Iranian families, adding that these shares would be from state-run companies that must be privatized.Iran Daily ‚Äì National ‚Äì 12/21/05 Justice shares are valued at $36 billion as of 2014.http://financialtribunedaily.com/articles/2014/09/16/economy-domestic- economy/701/govt-make-%E2%80%98justice-shares-tradable = Implementation = The poorest strata of society shall receive justice shares at a 50 percent discount and will pay the said amount in 10-year instalments. Villagers and nomads shall have priority in this respect. The holding period for those shares is a minimum of 2 years [afterwards]. Those covered by charity services rendered by the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee and the State Welfare Organizations as well as the jobless war veterans are prioritised in the first phase of the justice shares initiative. In the second phase, rural population and tribesmen will receive the shares. = Distribution = Directives on identifying those eligible to receive justice shares (in the second phase) have been issued and the shares will be distributed (among the rural residents and the tribesmen) after receiving their national code number. Up to 6.5 million rural residents who qualify for the shares have been identified and that 1.2 million more people are yet to complete their documents. The Government is promoting the shareholding culture in Iran. The total number of shareholders has reached 700,000 people and this figure is expected to reach 24-25 million. In December 2006, the Government informed that some 4.6 million low-income Iranians had received Justice shares worth $2.5 billion as part of the privatization scheme. Each person received around $550 in shares with a maximum of 5 payments for each family.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 11/28/06 In February 2008 the Iranian Economic Ministry announced that some 15 million rural people out of 23 million are entitled to justice shares by the next Iranian year (to start March 20, 2008). In November 2008 Iran announced that some 22.5 million people have received justice shares. However, in 2009 labor leaders complained that workers had received hardly any. More than seven million people have been categorized in the lowest-income bracket. By mid-June 2009, it was reported that almost 40 million people had received justice shares.  Criticism  The waves of privatization in Iran have been criticized by both labor and business leaders, albeit for different reasons. Some observers have argued that this \\"privatization\\" is modeled on the voucher distribution programs of Russia and Czechoslovakia in the 1990s, which, at least in the case of Russia, led to the rise of the oligarchs.Marshall Goldman, The Privatization of Russia (London: Routledge, 2003)Stephen Kotkin and A. Sajo, eds., Political Corruption in Transition (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2002). The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (Iran) has announced that it was forming a special committee to facilitate the process of making Justice Shares tradable on the stock exchange.  Shares for workers  As part of a policy of transferring shares of state firms to employees (5% of privatization proceeds), 20 million shares valued at 18.5 billion rials were transferred during September and October 2008, including to employees of Satkab, Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization, and subsidiaries of the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization.  Iranian expatriates' role  Privatization drive may gain further momentum if Iranian expatriates increase investment in their motherland. Iranian nationals residing abroad are holding significant assets. Many have invested their capital in other countries, following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the 1980‚Äì1988 war. Statistics at hand suggest that close to $10 billion (of goods) were re-exported into Iran last year. Multinational companies, particularly Iranian firms mostly owned and controlled by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are involved in export of goods into the country from Dubai. There are differing estimates of the expatriates' total capital (1.3 trillion dollarsIran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 02/14/07 ), but what is clear is that it is so huge that it will be enough to buy shares of all state companies. In Dubai alone, Iranian expatriates are estimated to have invested up to $200 billion.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 04/04/06 If 10 percent of this capital arrives, things will change drastically in Iran.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 09/02/06 = Investments = In 2000, the Iran Press Service reported that Iranian expatriates had invested between $200 and $400 billion in the United States, Europe, and China, but almost nothing in Iran. The Iranian government's efforts to encourage foreign investment from Iranians in the United States were thwarted in 1997 when President Bill Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting investments in Iran (ILSA). Nevertheless, FIPPA provisions apply to all foreign investors, and many Iranian expatriates based in the US continue to make substantial investments in Iran. = Expatriate fund = The government has proposed setting up a joint investment fund with $5 billion in basic capital and an economic union to serve Iranians living abroad. The stated goal is to attract investment from Iranian expatriates and using their experience in stimulating foreign investments. Later, in 2010, it was announced that Iran will start the process by creating a national fund with a basic capital of eight million euros. This fund will later transform into a bank.  Foreign investment  Foreign investors can bid in Iranian privatization tenders, but need permission from the Economy Ministry on a case-by-case basis. Iran has announced it will begin to allow foreign firms to purchase Iranian state-run companies, with the possibility of obtaining full ownership. = Offshore fund = A subsidiary of Iran's largest bank, Melli Investment Bank with branches in Dubai (UAE) and London, plans to launch a fund of up to $300 million to invest in the Tehran Stock Exchange, providing an alternative venue for foreigners to invest in the Iranian economy. The market, with a capitalisation of $37 billion, is trading at a fraction of the earnings multiples enjoyed by Iran's neighbours, while average earnings continue to grow at about 25 per cent a year. The fund will be composed of blue chip companies like Iran Khodro and will be based in the Cayman Island and managed from Iran.  Top 100 Iranian companies  The ranking has been assessed by Iran Industrial Management Company for the past 10 years.Top 100 Corporations Named Based on financial statements for March 2005‚Äì06, the '100 top Iranian corporations' were ranked and announced in a conference in early 2007. According to the economic expert in charge of the rankings, the main index considered was the sales of companies because \\"Sales figure indicates the growth of a corporation\\". According to the same survey, while 67 percent of the firms have experienced a decline in profit margin, car manufacturers, cement factories, investment institutions and banks have had an increase in the same index. The Iranian year March 2005-06 was a good year for these industries. Meanwhile, the Persian daily Ettelaat named the top five corporations as follows: Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) ranking first with an asset of 112,658 billion rials followed by Iran Khodro Industrial Group with an asset of 65,971 billion rials, Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO) with 52,184 billion rials, SAIPA car factory with 40,528 billion rials and National Iranian Petrochemical Company with 32,024 billion rials. They were followed by SAPCO, Bank Melli Iran, Bank Saderat Iran, Mobarakeh Steel Co. and Bank Mellat taking the sixth to tenth positions. Latest statistics show that the number of companies worth over one billion dollars on Tehran Stock Exchange (listed companies only) has reached 12. Among them are National Iranian Copper Industries Company (NICIC shares are worth $5.2 billion), Kharg Petrochemical Company, Ghadir petrochemical companies, Khuzestan Steel Company, Power Plant Projects Management Company (MAPNA), Retirement Investment Firm, Metal and Mine Investment Companies, Gol- Gohar Iron Ore Company ($2.1 billion), and Chadormalu Mining and Industrial Company.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 11/11/07 = Valuation = The assets of the top 100 Iranian publicly traded corporations ‚Äî not including the National Iranian Oil Company and affiliated companies, various IDRO-affiliated companies, the Defense Industries Organization, Iran Air and the Iran Aviation Industries Organization ‚Äî add up to $86 billion, which is less than that of a corporation such as Microsoft.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 02/27/07 But this does not account for goodwill that likely increases the real assets value of those same companies to more than one trillion US dollars.  Major companies listed for privatization  Of 1,000 companies awaiting the cabinet's approval, 240 companies had the green light already to be privatized by March 2008.Iran to privatize 240 companies by March ‚Äô08 As of 2014, Iran had also 930 industrial parks and zones, of which 731 are ready to be ceded to the private sector. = Banking and insurance = Most smaller state banks will be open to flotation, but excluded key banks including the Central Bank of Iran, Bank Melli Iran, Sepah Bank of Iran, Bank of Industry and Mines, Bank of Agriculture, Housing Bank (Bank Maskan) and the Export Development Bank of Iran. The privatization-bound banks are Tejarat, Mellat, Refah, Saderat, and Post Bank (ceding 100 percent of stakes of all 5 banks). Insurance companies Asia, Dana and Alborz will be listed on the stock exchange in 2009 after review and improvement in their financial accounts, internal regulations, organizational structure and dispersion nationwide. In 2008, the total insurance premiums generated in Iran were $4.3 billion. This is less than 0.1% of the world's total, while Iran has approximately 1% of the world's population. The insurance penetration rate is approximately 1.4%, significantly below the global average of 7.5%. This underdevelopment is also evident in product diversity. Approximately 60% of all insurance premiums are generated from car insurance. Also, 95% of all premiums come from general insurance contracts and only 5% relate to life products. Payout ratios have shown consistent growth over the years. Last year, the industry average payout ratio was 86%. = Industry = 102 companies out of the total 130, affiliated with IDRO, were due to be privatized by March 2009Iran-Daily:IDRO to Privatize 102 Companies Leading automakers Iran Khodro and Saipa were also due to be privatized in March 2008.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 09/11/07 In July 2010, the government sold a further 18% stake in both Iran Khodro and Saipa for about $2 billion in total, bringing down its participation in both companies to about 20%. Shares of Iran Tractor Manufacturing Company have also been offered on the Tehran Stock Exchange as part of an IPO. = Utilities = Shazand (Arak) power plant Mapna Company. Sahand, Bistoun, Shazand (Arak), Shahid Montazeri, Tous, Shahid Rajaei and Neishabour power stations are among the profit-making plants, work on privatizing them will be finalized by late March 2007.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 01/28/07 Jahrom, Khalij-e Fars (Persian Gulf) and Sahand power plants will be ceded to the private sector in 2009. All domestic power plants will be privatized gradually, except those the government feels it should run to ensure security of the national electricity grid. Power plants of Damavand, Mashhad, Shirvan, Kerman, Khalij-e Fars, Abadan, Bisotoon, Sanandaj, Manjil and Binalood, which have been turned into public limited firms, are ready for privatization. As of 2010, 20 power plants were ready for privatization in Iran. Upon ceding the 20 power plants to IPO, some 40 percent of the capacity of power plants nationwide will be assigned to the private and cooperative sectors. = Mines & metals = National Iranian Copper Industries Co.(NICICO), Mobarakeh Steel Co., Khuzestan Steel Company, Isfahan Steel Mills, Iranian Aluminum Company (IRALCO), Ehdas Sanat Company (ESC) and Iran Alloy Stell Co. are all candidates for privatization.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 05/07/07 Turquoise Partners: Iran Investment Monthly (February 2011) Retrieved April 30, 2011 The Privatization Organization of Iran announced that Iranian Aluminum Co. and Bushehr Cement Co. would be privatized in June 2007.Iran to privatize 2 companies by June 21 The steel, cement and iron ore prices are currently being liberalized in Iran. = Transport = As planned, all airline companies except for Civil Aviation Organization as well as Ports and Shipping Organization should be ceded to the people. This covers flag carrier Iran Air and its affiliate Iran Aseman Airlines. The fast-growing Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines has also been lobbying for more independence. The government has agreed to offer the shares of Iran Post Company in the bourse (2008). The National Iranian Tanker Company's shares have been offered to the private sector in 2009. In 2009 Iran announced that Imam Khomeini port, its biggest port in the Persian Gulf, will be privatized. Bandar Abbas has also been listed for privatization. = Telecommunication = In 2006, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced that it will float the shares of affiliated companies such as Mobile Telecommunications Company in the stock market.Iran-Daily: Privatization of Telecom Companies Under the general policies of Article 44, telecom companies are categorised in four groups as follows: * Group One: Among the 30 provincial telecom networks, the fixed telecom networks pertain to those of Tehran, Isfahan, Fars, Hamedan, Ahvaz, Khorasan Razavi, Khuzestan and East Azarbaijan. The first group concerns fixed line telecom networks, including those in the public sector with 30 subsidiary telecom networks in provinces. The non-governmental sector includes companies such as Iraphone, Novin, Zahi Kish, Kouh-e Nour, Montazeran Adlgostar and Pouya Ertebat with each having hundreds of thousands of subscribers. * Group Two: The second group concerns mobile telephone networks. In the public sector, they include the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) to be privatized by March 2008. In the non-governmental sector, they include telecommunications companies such as Omran Kish, Isfahan, Rafsanjan Complex and Irancell. * Group Three: There is only one public network in the data network sector, namely Data and Telecommunications Company of Iran, which is considered a basic telecom network in terms of mobile networks and Shomal IT Company. In the non- governmental sector, there are over 100 companies with a shared data network. * Group Four: The subsidiary telecom network named Subsidiary Telecommunications Company is another basic telecom network. They are completely owned by the state and not targeted for privatization. In 2009, 51% of TCI was sold to Mobin Trust Consortium, a consortium belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for the sum of $7.8 billion. = Oil, gas and petrochemicals = Arak (Shazand) Petrochemical company * According to the Supreme Leader of Iran the downstream oil and gas sectors will be privatized, excluding the upstream oil and gas industry, the National Iranian Oil Company, the state companies involved in exploration and the production of crude oil and gas. Iran's Oil Ministry plans to cede shares of 95 percent of its affiliated companies to the private sector. Just 7 out of 142 subsidiaries of the Ministry of Petroleum have been excluded from the privatization process. * Some shares will be dual-listed on regional foreign stock exchanges to attract expatriate investors. A list of 21 companies to be privatized will be released by mid-2007. Of these companies, five belong to National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), nine to National Iranian Petrochemical Company (NPC), five are affiliates of National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC), and two of National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC), including the Abadan Refinery. National Iranian Gas Company, the Iranian Oil Terminals Company and the National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company are also on the list. The ownership of the jetties, metering facilities and storage tanks will still remain in government hands. Iranian Oil Terminals Co., a division of the National Iranian Oil Co., has four transport hubs that load more than 2,000 oil tankers per year. * Iran is to target foreign investment in its energy sector by creating an umbrella group of nearly 50 state-run firms and listing its shares on four international stock exchanges. Under the privatization plan, 47 oil and gas companies (including PetroIran and North Drilling Company) worth an estimated $90 billion are to be privatized on the Tehran Stock Exchange by 2014.Iran Daily ‚Äì Domestic Economy ‚Äì 02/10/08 * Iran's National Petrochemical Company (NPC) plans to privatize 17 companies by the end of 2007.Iran to privatize 17 petrochemical companies by March 20 Forty percent of those shares will go to \\"Justice Shares\\" for underprivileged citizens in Iran. 20% will be allocated to NPC. 35% will be put on sale on the Tehran Stock Exchange and the remaining 5% will go the petrochemical industry personnel. The 20 percent allocated to the NPC is meant to support petrochemical industry projects but may be offered to the private sector in the future. 89.6 percent of Shiraz Petrochemical Complex, and 27.76 percent of Petrochemical Investment Company will be sold to the public in June 2009. All shares of domestic petrochemical firms will be offered to the public in the frame of a holding company by the end of Iranian year (ending March 21, 2010). As part of the 2010 Iranian Economic Reform Plan, petrochemical companies, which use natural gas as their feedstock (rather than fuel), will pay no more than 65% of the average export price (rather than 75% for the general population) for a period of 10 years. * Iran also projects to privatize some of its oil refineries (2009). Isfahan, Bandar Abbas, Tabriz, Shiraz, Kermanshah, Lavan, and Tehran (Shahid Tondgouyan) oil refineries will be transferred to the private sector but the ownership of Abadan and Arak (Imam Khomeini) oil refineries will remain in government control. * The government of Iran announced in 2017 that a vast majority of the country's 3,600 gas and diesel stations along with 2,400 CNG stations would be privatized in order improve service and raise accountability. On August 8, 2017 a European firm based jointly in Greece and Romania announced it was planning to commercialize a number of stations. The deal is expected to grow economic ties between the EU and Iran.

She was often spotted swimming in the English Channel. There is a website dedicated to the dolphin which was created by an angler called Simon Chandler. During her time in the area, Davina received several serious injuries from being struck by boat propellers of people going out to see her. In August, 2007, she received an injury to her dorsal fin that took several months to heal.Dolphin hit by boat propeller Then, in October, she lost a third of her tail, and this was considered a life-threatening injury.Concern for missing Kent dolphin She was successfully treated with antibiotics administered by a vet working with the cetacean rescue organisation British Divers Marine Life Rescue.Article about injury and treatment She was seen in the area after this, and her condition appeared to be improving. However, she suddenly went missing from the area shortly after this. She was last reported to be seen in early November 2007.Still no sign of Dave the dolphin Although BDMLR marine mammal medics are still visiting the area on a regular basis, she has not been seen since, and there are fears that she may have died of an infection to her tail wound or may have been caught in fishing nets and drowned. But there has been no confirmation of this either way and hopes are that she is still alive but has simply left the area or perhaps rejoined another pod of dolphins.Press release from BDMLR, Marine Connection,and WDCS: Dave missing and feared dead British Divers Marine Life Rescue had volunteers watching out for the safety of the dolphin and monitoring Davina and the behaviour of members of the public around her from the moment she appeared in the area. They also provided educational materials, passing out information leaflets to people on the beach and answering questions. Tougher laws needed to protect friendly dolphins Along with other organisations from the Marine Animal Rescue Coalition, BDMLR was concerned for the safety and well being of any solitary dolphin due to these animals often becoming harmed by human interaction. Davina is a female bottlenosed dolphin, and she is estimated to be about 6 years old according to the MARC.Newspaper article: Zoologist claims Dave the dolphin is a girl On 9 June 2007, two men were arrested while swimming with Dave, for the crime of 'disturbing' a dolphin.Pair charged over dolphin actions They pleaded not guilty and the case is still ongoing at Folkestone Magistrate's Court.Kent Online newspaper article on court case On April 17, 2008 Michael Jukes, 27 and Daniel Buck, 26, were both ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work after magistrates convicted them of intentionally or recklessly disturbing a wild animal contrary to the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981.

Biography Secon was born to a Jewish familyThe Michigan Daily: \\"Lucas takes the \\"lid off\\" of hip hop\\" December 9, 1994 in Philadelphia, the son of immigrants from Russia. He was musically gifted, and played the trumpet, piano, oboe and flute. Secon was the music critic for The Boston Evening Transcript. In 1950, he was a music editor for Billboard and Variety and a creative songwriter having written for Nat King Cole and The Mills Brothers (among many others) whilst living in New York City when he heard about a business opportunity from Morris. Morris' wife had recently purchased stoneware at a yard sale in their hometown of Rochester, New York. Morris took a liking to the pieces, which were designed by Glidden Parker at his factory in Alfred, New York. Parker informed him that he had three barns full of discontinued or slightly damaged products for sale. The brothers decided to buy the pieces for US$2,500, and, with the help of their father, rented a store on 10th Avenue in New York City to sell their wares, thus giving birth to Pottery Barn. A year later, an article in The New Yorker praised the store, and customers flocked to it in droves. Secon remained store manager, while Morris, who was also musically inclined, became principal hornist for the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and teacher at the Eastman School of Music. In 1959, Secon started taking long trips to Europe in search of new product lines, and asked Morris to help manage the store. In 1966, Secon sold the company to Morris and moved to Denmark, where he pursued his earlier career of music and writing, and where his son, Lucas Secon (best known for his 1994 hit song \\"Lucas with the Lid Off\\") was born. In 1980, Secon moved back to the United States and settled in Manhattan before relocating to Rochester in 1997, where he died at his home at the age of 90. Personal life Secon has been married twice. His first wife was Fairfax Kirby; they had one daughter, journalist Kirby Fairfax (born 1949).Added by Kirby Fairfax herself on March 15, 2014. She has two children, Mary Landucci, who lives in Southern California, and Robert Chaffee, who lives in Chicago. His second wife was Danish artist Berta Moltke; they had one son; record producer Lucas Secon, born in 1970.

In 1992 he formed Dirty Three, an instrumental rock band, with fellow mainstays Warren Ellis on violin; and Mick Turner on guitar. In Dirty Three, White shares songwriting duties with Ellis and Turner. White has also played with various other artists including PJ Harvey, Bonnie Prince Billy, Cat Power, Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile, Smog, The Blackeyed Susans, Kim Salmon's STM, Venom P. Stinger, The Tren Brothers,and Nina Nastasia. White currently records and performs with Xylouris White, a duo formed with Cretan lute player Giorgos Xylouris. Biography Jim Ronald White was born in 1962 and grew up in Clifton Hill, Victoria. In 1980, as a drummer, he formed Happy Orphans with Conway Savage on piano and backing vocals. Late the following year he replaced Peter Rippon on drums in a noise rock group, The People with Chairs up Their Noses, alongside Mark Barry on bass guitar, David Palliser on saxophone and lead vocals, and Jim Shugg on lead guitar. In 1982 they issued a split extended play on Au Go Go Records with their two tracks, \\"Road to Egg\\" and \\"The New Band\\", backed by a track from fellow Melbourne rockers Plays with Marionettes (see the Wreckery). When performing White provided percussion by using an \\"ironing board covered with letter boxes and other domestic detritus\\". Also in 1982 White, with Shugg on lead guitar and lead vocals, rejoined Savage in a country rock group, Feral Dinosaurs. He sometimes played in both The People with Chairs up Their Noses and Feral Dinosours on the same night. Other founding members of Feral Dinosaurs were Nick Danyi on saxophone and David Last on double bass and vocals. By late 1983 The People with Chairs up Their Noses had disbanded and White continued with Feral Dinosaurs. In 1984 they provided a cover version of Don Gibson's 1958 hit, \\"Blue Day\\", on the various artist's compilation album, Asleep at the Wheel, for Au Go Go Records. Feral Dinosaurs released two singles, \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and \\"50 Miles from Home\\", followed by an EP in December 1985, You've All Got a Home to Go To, on the Major Records label before disbanding in 1986. In 1985 White formed another band, Venom P. Stinger, as an avant-rock ensemble with Dugald Mackenzie on lead vocals (ex-Sick Things, Brainshack); Alan Secher-Jensen on bass guitar (Brainshack, Beachnuts); and Mick Turner on guitar (Sick Things, Fungus Brains, The Moodists). They issued their debut album, Meet My Friend Venom (1986), but disbanded in 1989 when Turner returned to Fungus Brains. White had drummed for Hessian Sax during 1988 to 1989 and for Conway Savage & the Deep South in 1989. Venom P. Stinger's second album, What's Yours Is Mine, was released in October 1990. The group reformed in 1991 with MacKenzie, Turner and White joined by Nick Palmer on lead vocals. In November they issued a four-track EP, Waiting Room. The group toured the United States and released a live album, Live (in Davis), in 1992. By the end of the year White and Turner had left Venom P. Stinger. In 1992 White and Turner formed an instrumental rock group, Dirty Three, with Warren Ellis on violin (ex-These Future Kings). The trio recorded a cassette, Dirty Three, as a give-away at early gigs. In the same year White and Ellis were also working in the rock bands, The Blackeyed Susans, Kim Salmon's STM and Charles Marshall and the Body Electric. The following year White and Turner reformed Venom P. Stinger, and recorded another album, Tear Bucket, which appeared in 1996. In 1994 White and Ellis backed Tex, Don and Charlie on a national tour. In June that year Dirty Three issued their self-titled album on Torn & Frayed Records for which Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, praised White's \\"sympathetic drumming\\". In November 1994 they released an album in the US, Sad & Dangerous, which included tracks from their 1992 give-away cassette. From March 1995 the trio toured the US and completed 200 gigs by year's end. In July Sad & Dangerous was issued in Australia. The group followed with further studio albums: Horse Stories (September 1996), Ocean Songs (March 1998), Whatever You Love, You Are (March 2000), She Has No Strings Apollo (February 2003), Cinder (October 2005) and Toward the Low Sun (February 2012). Almost all of Dirty Three's material is co-written by White with Ellis and Turner. In mid-1998 White and Turner formed an instrumental duo, The Tren Brothers, and issued a five-track self- titled EP. Most of The Tren Brothers material is written by Turner alone or with White. In January 2000 White and Ellis backed Nick Cave on his tour of Australia. In 2003 White backed Nina Nastasia and subsequently was recorded on her albums Run to Ruin (2003) and On Leaving (2006). On 28 May 2007 the pair released a collaborative album, You Follow Me. It was co-produced by White, Nastasia and Kennan Gudjonsson. Allmusic's Thom Jurek noted that White \\"is not an accompanist here, he is a collaborator, even though he didn't write the songs\\", with the production emphasising his \\"full of bassy tom toms and wispy brushwork\\" where White \\"floats, digs, sputters, halts, and pushes through the music, just as [Nastasia's] playing guitar and singing does\\". In 2013 he started playing with Anderson Henderson White.http://lucidculture.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/ahw/ White formed Xylouris White in 2013, a collaboration with Greek singer and laouto player George Xylouris. The duo's music has been described as combining \\"free-jazz, avant- rock and ages-old Greek folk traditions.\\" To date they have released three albums, produced by Guy Picciotto (Fugazi), and undertaken numerous world tours. When not performing or recording, White lives in New York City.

Digital textbooks may also be known as e-textbooks or e-texts. Digital textbooks are a major component of technology-based education reform. They may serve as the texts for a traditional face-to-face class, an online course or degree, or massive open online courses (MOOCs). Implementation There are many potential advantages to digital textbooks. They may offer lower costs, make it easier to monitor student progress, and are easier and cheaper to update when needed. Open source e-textbooks may offer the opportunity to create free, modifiable textbooks for basic subjects, or give individual teachers the opportunity to create e-texts for their own classrooms. They may offer better access to quality texts in the developing world. For this reason, many schools and colleges around the world have made the implementation of digital textbooks a central component of education policy. For example, in South Korea, reading materials in all public schools will be digitized by 2015. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission aims for every student to be able to access e-texts by 2017. However, the transition to e-textbooks is costly, complex and controversial. Students express a strong preference for printed materials in many surveys and across cultures. Many interconnected factors, from device access, to digital literacy, to teaching methods affect the implementation of digital textbooks in the classroom. Issues of overall value, book quality, privacy, and intellectual property have yet to be resolved. Devices Because digital textbooks must be accessed through an electronic device, such as a laptop or e-reader, schools and colleges must determine how to provide access to all students. Many school districts are now offering \\"one-to-one\\" technology programs, in which a tablet or laptop is issued to each student. This ensures that all of the devices meet the same requirements (such as memory or software) and that all the devices can be networked, monitored and upgraded together. However, the one-to-one model also imposes significant costs on school districts, and brings up issues of privacy and personal use. An alternative to one-to-one is to ask students to use their own electronic devices in class. This is called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or, sometimes, Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT). BYOD allows students to choose their preferred device for studying. Compared to one-to- one, it decreases the technology and maintenance costs for institutions. But not all students' devices may be compatible with the digital textbooks require for a class, and the devices may not be able to network with each other. A BYOD approach may also count out students who cannot afford a computer, e-reader or smartphone. Interactivity A major selling point of digital textbooks is that they offer the opportunity for students to access multimedia content, such as embedded videos, interactive presentations and hyperlinks. Tests and other assessments can be included in the textbook, classmates can work together, and student progress can be tracked. Touchscreen technology offers students the chance to participate in projects, research or experiments. This may offer a different or better learning experience than printed textbooks. Digitization also promises to offer improved access to textbooks for student with disabilities. For example, high-contrast displays, or text-to-speech programs can help visually impaired students use the same textbooks their classmates use. The creation of interactive and customizable content is an important part of digital textbook development. Interactive digital content is costly to produce, however, and research on learning outcomes is still in the preliminary stages. Open vs. closed The concepts of open access and open source support the idea of open textbooks, digital textbooks that are free (gratis) and easy to distribute, modify and update (libre). Schools, teachers or professors may design their own open textbooks by gathering open access scholarly articles or other open access resources into one text or one curriculum. Open textbooks offer affordable access, especially to basic and common information, and pose a challenge to traditional models of textbook publishing. Modifiable or community edited textbooks may also be difficult to establish as credible or scholarly sources. Other models for digital textbook publishing are more traditional. Textbook publishers may offer digital textbooks or digital curriculums that are standardized across classrooms, easier to update, and compliant with national standards, teaching methods or goals. This approach also offers pitfalls. License or renewal fees for digital textbooks may impose unexpected costs for institutions. For example, in 2013, the LA Unified School District announced that it would face an additional $60 million to license the curriculum for its one-to-one iPad program. Outcomes Though many governments and school districts are making large investments in digital textbooks, adoption is slow. According to data from Bowker Market Research, in the spring semester of 2013, only 3% of college students used a digital textbook as their primary course material. In multiple studies, strong majorities of college students, teens, and children continue to express a preference for printed books. Furthermore, there is conflicting information about how digital textbooks affect learning, cognition and retention. However, students are growing more exposed to digital textbooks, and new research suggests that student performance is about the same whether students work from digital or printed texts.
