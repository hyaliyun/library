It shows the epiphany of the triumphant Dionysus. Location The ancient site, with significant excavations and an archaeological museum, is located just outside the modern village of Dion in the Greek region of Central Macedonia in the coastal plain at the foot of Mount Olympus, about 15 km from Katerini and about 17 km from the ancient city of Leivithra. Description In the center of the large mosaic, Dionysus is depicted in a chariot. Next to him stands a mature Silenus, who is more a helper of the god than a driver. The carriage is drawn by two panthers, two centaurs hold their reins. One of the two centaurs is a mature, bearded man carrying a vessel (crater) that probably contains wine. The other Kentauer carries on his shoulder a closed vessel in which presumably the sacred symbols of the Dionysus cult are located. The light background highlights the figure of Dionysus. The mosaic artist used mosaic stones (tesserae) of different sizes and several dozens of shades of color to show details. He thereby gave his work the character of a painting. Surely he was inspired to his work by an important Hellenistic painting. Dionysus mask Of high quality are also the masks under and above the central mosaic. Three on the eastern and three on the western side. The middle of the three masks of the lower (eastern) side shows Dionysus with long curls. The mask to his left shows a mature satyr with a snub nose. The mask to the right of him shows a barbarian. The eyes sting, his eyes are lowered. Probably it is Lycurgus, King of Thrace, and an enemy of Dionysus. He pursued the young god, who threw himself into the sea and was saved by Thetis. The masks above (west) of the Dionysosmosa form a young Satyr on the left and an older Silenius on the right. The mask in between shows the face of a woman with blue eyes and curly hair. This may be the nymph Thetis, the savior of Dionysus. The central mosaic of the epiphany of Dionysus has the dimensions of 220 cm by 150 cm; The entire mosaic has a floor area of approximately 100 m¬≤. Excavations In the summer of 1987 archaeologists found the most important mosaic of the extensive excavation site (, excavations are still under way). Protected by the covering soil layer it is almost completely preserved. Of course this precious find had to be protected but should also be accessible to the public. The archaeologists decided to name the place where the mosaic was unearthed \\"Villa of Dionysus\\". For over 20 years, the mosaic was sheltered under a roof structure. In order to be able to see the work from all sides, a footbridge was built, on which visitors could orbit it. The roof helped against the rays of the sun, but it was powerless against water and general decay. From year to year the condition became worse: single mosaic stones dissolved from the ground, plants grew in the cracks, it was only a matter of time before this mosaic, which had remained largely intact for nearly two millennia, would be destroyed. Restoration Works at the mosaic It was decided to create a special building for this work of art. It is located just west of the museum, the Archaiothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the \\"Villa of Dionysos\\". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In order to be able to divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special adhesive fabric and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several belt tensioners, the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500 kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaiothiki. Meanwhile, in the Archaiothiki, a precise image of the entire mosaic was spread on the ground. It was made on a scale of 1:1 to show the restorers where to place each single part. In order to stabilize the mosaic stones, in the next step, the carrier layer under the mosaic was removed and replaced by mortar. With steam, the curators dissolved the special adhesive fabric and removed the attached protective materials. In June 2017 the works had been finished.

Construction has yet to begin and the project still remains standing as a distant proposal. Several feasibility studies have been completed, notable by Germany and China. The Indian High Speed Rail Commission requested for route designs to be tendered in February 2020. The proposal would see the journey times between the two cities reduced to around ninety minutes with upgrading work costing around 200Rs/km.  History  The current journey from Chennai to Bengaluru run at and takes 6‚Äì7 hours to complete, with ticket prices starting for Second Seating as little as ‚Çπ150 and for Sleeper Class at ‚Çπ230. The Shatabdi Express runs at an average of , covering the distance in 5 hours with ticket prices starting at ‚Çπ975. Karnataka Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, suggested that the state wanted to run bullet trains to Chennai, and was conducting talks with his counterparts in Japan about the topic. He commented that the journey could be done in less that one hour though no studies had yet been conducted prior to those words. A feasibility study by China on the project was submitted to the Federal Government in June 2015. While Germany also proposed to conduct its own feasibility study at the same time. The then Railways Minister, Suresh Prabhu, suggested that the route would be one of the next high-speed railways to be implemented in India. Japan Railway Technical Service (JARTS) and Oriental Consultants submitted a feasibility study in early 2016 about constructing the high-speed railway line through a PPP with the government. In mid-2016, the government of Andhra Pradesh floated a Special Purpose Vehicle to support the creation of high- speed railways passing through the state. French state-owned company SNCF also expressed an interest in building a high-speed railway line too. In early 2017, Indian Railways (IR) responded to a proposal by Elon Musk for a Hyperloop to connect the two cities in thirty minutes, saying that it would be unlikely due to government bureaucracy. During the June 2017 opening of Bengaluru's Green Line, Japan‚Äôs Ambassador to India, Kenji Hiramatsu, suggested that the railway line should be built with support from Japanese development funds.  Description  The high-speed railway line would mainly be built alongside the existing railway between the two cities. However, a viaduct between Bangarapet and Vaniyambadi, as well as a viaduct between Katpadi and Arakkonam, would need to be constructed due to hilly terrain. There would be two new railway stations built underground in Bengaluru, while Chennai would witness the high-speed trains, running at around , terminating at its existing central station.

Early life Endre B√≠r√≥ was born on April 19, 1919 into a liberal-minded Hungarian-Jewish family as the second son of Lip√≥t B√≠r√≥ and Emma Gr√°ber. B√≠r√≥ got an M.A. degree for teachers in physics and chemistry at Szeged University, called then the Mikl√≥s Horthy University of Szeged. (\\"Szeged presented its own peculiarities. Since the faculty at Budapest was notoriously pro-fascist, Jewish students in the thirties found it easier to get admitted to provincial colleges, working their way around the hated 'numerus clausus'. Thus, each September, Szeged university had more than the five percent quota of Jews.This, in turn, served as a good pretext for riots by right-wing students, mainly members of the Turul organization. Prof N. A. B√≠r√≥ remembers those days well. Of Jewish origin and from a liberal family to boot, he was accepted into Szeged with the help of a Gentile family friend. In the fall of each year, rioting broke out in Szeged. Forewarned, B√≠r√≥ and other Jewish students hid across the river in New Szeged until the fighting was over.\\" Ralph W.

D. dissertation, Szeged, 1942. After having finished university, B√≠r√≥, taking into account the then prevailing social circumstances, did not even try to look for a job due to Hungary's anti-Jewish laws. (\\"By 1940 the number of Jews affected by anti-Jewish legislation in Hungary to the extent of being deprived of their livelihood was about 224,000.\\" W.S. Faber: Hungary's Alibi, London, 1944, p. 31.) left In 1942 he was drafted into labor service that was required of Jewish men during World War II, who, based on Hungary's anti-Jewish laws, were barred from serving in the Hungarian Army. Draft-aged Hungarian Jewish men were used as auxiliary troops of the Hungarian army. They were not allowed to bear arms, and towards the end of the war they were not allowed to wear military uniforms. In the summer of 1944 B√≠r√≥ defected his labor service unit in Transylvania, became a Soviet prisoner of war and before his return to Hungary he lived in Bucharest in 1944 and 1945. B√≠r√≥ first went to Brass√≥ and then to Bucharest, where he received help from the Joint. B√≠r√≥ was living in Budapest when he saw a report in one of the papers informing its readers that Albert Szent-Gyorgyi planned to come to Budapest to start a research institute. In a motivation letter dated April 9, 1945 written to Albert Szent- Gy√∂rgyi and preserved among B√≠r√≥'s papers, he writes, among others, as follows: \\"As indicated by the enclosed resume, even earlier the reason for my going to university was my intention to devote myself to pure scientific research. I felt I had a scholarly aptitude. However, in the previous regime, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was not able to achieve much in scientific research. I am firmly committed to my decision of dealing with pure scientific research, although I am aware that being a scientist does not mean a high salary.\\" Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi on the left, Tam√°s Erd≈ës on the far right, next to him Endre B√≠r√≥, the person whose face cannot be seen is W.F.H.M.

Remembering these times, one of B√≠r√≥'s colleagues writes as follows: \\"I started my career as a fresh university graduate at the Medical Chemistry Institute in 1950. M√°tyas R√°kosi, who was officially referred to as the ¬´best disciple of Stalin¬ª, had already instituted a reign of terror in the country, and the waves of the terror started to reach the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as well as the universities, including the Medical Chemistry Institute, at this time. Endre B√≠r√≥ hardly survived the shameful times of 1944, and now he had to face another crisis. Colleagues who had a similar career benefited a great deal from the ¬´new order¬ª and thus became willy-nilly the tools of terror. Endre B√≠r√≥ stayed aloof from this ¬´solution¬ª. (...) Endre B√≠r√≥ led an exemplary life. He respected science very much indeed, and he never treated it as a means for his career. Due to his modesty, he was pushed to the background in an unfair way.... A professor heading an institute does not always have time for the junior research assistants. However, Zebi (as Endre B√≠r√≥ was nicknamed for short) was always available when needed. We had a maxim: ¬´Don't worry, Zebi will explain it!¬ª \\" Dezs≈ë Pr√°gay in: \\"In Memory of Professor Endre B√≠r√≥ (Recollections on Professor Endre B√≠r√≥)\\" Biok√©mia (The Quarterly of the Hungarian Biochemical Society), March, 1989. Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi and his team, including B√≠r√≥, attended the 6th International Congress of Experimental Cytology lasting from July 10 till July 17, 1947 in Stockholm. Dissatisfied with the Communist rule of Hungary, most members of Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi's team emigrated to the West.\\"Sometime in late 1946 and early 1947, Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi received a letter from a colleague in South America. He offered Szent-Gy√∂rgyi a research position and volunteered to take his assistants as well. Albert read this letter at the afternoon tea, a custom which had been re-instituted in Budapest. 'Who would like to go with me?' he asked in a half- joking way./Only three of his young colleagues declined. One was a devoted Communist, one had a family he could not leave; while B√≠r√≥, who was Jewish, felt relatively good about the new situation. All the others, however, said that they were ready to follow.\\" Ralph W. Moss: op. cit. pp.157-158. (B√≠r√≥ met Szent-Gy√∂rgyi the next time twenty-five years later in 1972 in America, in Cold Spring Harbor.) B√≠r√≥ got a Ph.D. degree in biological sciencesAz izomfeh√©rj√©k biok√©mi√°ja a mechanok√©miai kapcsolat szempontj√°b√≥l (The Biochemistry of Muscle Proteins in Terms of the Mechanochemical Connection), Ph.D. dissertation, Budapest, 1955. in 1955, and an advanced doctorate degree of biological sciencesNagymolekulas√∫ly√∫ tel√≠tetlen zs√≠rsavak nagyv√°kuumban val√≥ viselked√©s√©nek vizsg√°lata (The Examination of High-Molecular-Weight Unsaturated Fatty Acids in High Vacuum), advanced Ph.D. dissertation, Budapest, 1967. in 1967. In 1950 the Communist regime changed the name of P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University into E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University and, a year later, made the medical faculty of the University into an independent medical school Semmelweis University.The Medical Chemistry Institute started to teach medical chemistry in September 1949 under the leadership of Brun√≥ Ferenc Straub with some of the teaching staff of the previous Biochemistry Institute as well as with newly employed physicians and chemists. Based on recollections, the first teachers of medical chemistry were Endre B√≠r√≥, Erzs√©bet B√∂l√∂ny, G√©za D√©nes, Gy√∂rgy Feuer, Gy√∂rgy G√°rdos, Tam√°s Garz√≥, Ferenc Guba, Dezs≈ë Pr√°gay, Istv√°n Sz√°ra, M√°ria Sz√©kely, Zsuzsa Sz≈ënyi and Ullmann √Ågnes. In 1953 B√≠r√≥ was invited to head the Animal Biochemistry Department of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. However, as instructed by the Ministry of Culture, after a few years the department ended its activities, and within the Department of Genetics, a small Biochemistry Research Unit was set up. In the beginnings, this research unit had only two full-time employees ‚Äì B√≠r√≥ and the recently graduated B√©la Nagy. After B√©la Nagy had gone to the United States, Andr√°s M√ºhlrad became the second member of the research unit. Remembering these times, Andr√°s M√ºhlrad points out: \\"I have never known a researcher who was so much exempt from vanity or narrow-minded personal ambition. B√≠r√≥ was always ready to help his students and colleagues with good advice. His broad knowledge transcended biochemistry and included also the social sciences. His contact with people was characterized by the fact that he naively always assumed the best of all the people he came into contact with. Therefore, he hardly had any enemies. This is something rare in science where so much moral frailty can be observed even amongst the best researchers.\\"Andr√°s M√ºhlrad in \\"In Memory of Professor Endre B√≠r√≥ (Recollections on Professor Endre B√≠r√≥)\\" Biok√©mia (The Quarterly of the Hungarian Biochemical Society), March, 1989. \\"From 1962 on, the research unit employed new staff (Gabriella Kelemen, Mikl√≥s B√°lint and Gy√∂rgy Hegyi). Back then this research group was poorly equipped, but this was largely offset thanks to the ingenuity of B√≠r√≥. Based on his patented invention, the Hungarian Optical Works started to produce the first Hungarian photometer, called UVIFOT, which could operate also in the ultraviolet range. In 1968 the Biochemistry Research Unit became independent of the Department of Genetics and moved into spacious premises, located on the ground-floor and the basement of a university building under 3 Pushkin Street. The long-awaited event was enthusiastically celebrated by both the staff members and the students.\\"A tansz√©k t√∂rt√©nete (The history of the department) In 1968 B√≠r√≥ became a university professor and the head of the newly established Department of Biochemistry. In addition to extensive teaching activities, the Department of Biochemistry at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University did research into the biochemistry of proteins and the biology of muscle contraction. The Department had internationally recognized results in the study of the structure of myosin. The activities of the Biochemistry Research Group and then of the Department of Biochemistry were centered on B√≠r√≥'s research topics. B√≠r√≥ published one of his most outstanding research findings together with Andr√°s Szent-Gy√∂rgyi jun., the cousin of Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi. They pointed out that the activity of myosin Mg-ATP can be boosted with actin. Even by today's strict standards, the school of B√≠r√≥ had an outstanding achievement and contributed a great deal to the good reputation of Hungarian biochemistry. B√≠r√≥'s interests were not limited to the natural sciences. He was a member of the circle of artists, scientists and scholars that emerged around philosopher, Lajos Szab√≥. Lajos Szab√≥, an intellectual guru had some new disciples from each generation. B√≠r√≥ got acquainted with him through his brother, G√°bor B√≠r√≥ who was by seven years his senior. The circle of Lajos Szab√≥ was by no means an organization with formalized rules. This was a company of friends and an open school with a multi-disciplinary approach. Between 1947 and 1950 B√≠r√≥ attended the lectures delivered by Lajos Szab√≥.Szab√≥ Lajos szemin√°riumi el√µad√°sai 1947-1950 Retrieved 1 February 2019. These lecture seminars were sometimes also attended by the essayist B√©la Hamvas and the philosopher B√©la T√°bor. He translated extensive excerpts from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and wrote a detailed study on this work of fiction. Due to the Communist oppression of culture, these translations and the accompanying essay could not be published in Hungary. They were first published in 1964 in Yugoslavia in the Hungarian literary monthly H√≠d (Bridge). (This magazine for ethnic Hungarians living in Yugoslavia was open to the pursuits of the avant-garde.) A Paris-based important literary magazine founded by Hungarian intellectuals who fled Hungary in 1956, Magyar M≈±hely (Hungarian Workshop) published the translation alongside with the essay on Finnegans Wake. This translation had a significant impact on post-modern Hungarian prose.

Ellis is notable both for the work he did for the Recording Britain project during the Second World War and for his role in the development of art teaching. Biography VE-Day, Bath, 8th May 1945 (1945) (Art.IWM ART LD 5201) Ellis was born in Bognor Regis, Sussex. He came from an artistic family: his grandfather had been an artist and his uncle, Ralph Ellis, was a designer who had studied at the Slade School of Art. After a year at Saint Martin's School of Art, Clifford Ellis studied illustration at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London between 1924 and 1927. He then spent a year taking a post-graduate teacher training course before gaining a diploma in the history of art from the University of London. In 1928, Ellis returned to Regent Street Polytechnic as a teacher and continued to teach there until 1936. During this period he married Rosemary (1910‚Äì1998), and the couple began working together on a number of artistic projects and commissions. Their work included posters for London Transport and the General Post Office, and several designs for book covers and dust jackets, most notably for the long-running New Naturalist series published by Collins. For Shell-Mex, starting in 1934 with Antiquaries Prefer Shell, they designed the 'Professions' series of posters including, for example, Anglers Prefer Shell. They also produced poster designs for the Empire Marketing Board and also lithographs for J. Lyons & Co.. Together they also designed mosaics for walls and floors, including the floor of the entrance hall of the British Pavilion at the Paris International Exhibition of 1937. In 1936, Ellis took a teaching post at Bath Technical College and in 1937 he was appointed Head of the Bath Academy of Art. During World War II, Ellis oversaw the move of the Academy to new premises twice, first when its original premises were required for military use and on a second occasion when the new premises were destroyed in April 1942. Also during the war, Ellis was commissioned to record scenes in Bath for the Recording Britain project. In particular, in 1942 he was commissioned to depict examples of the decorative architectural ironwork seen on the city's buildings as the Ministry of Works were removing the iron to help the war effort. As well as painting examples of the decoration, Ellis intervened with the Ministry to save several important, early nineteenth century examples from being scrapped. Ellis also recorded the effects of the Bath Blitz bombing raids on the city; the War Artists' Advisory Committee purchased examples of these pieces and also his depiction of the VE-Day celebrations in the city. After the war, Ellis and Rosemary continued with their artistic collaborations. In 1946 they designed the entrance area to the Britain Can Make It exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum and between 1945 and 1982 they designed 86 covers and dust jackets for the New Naturalist series of books and monographs. The couple signed these jackets, and other works, C&RE; to reflect their joint and equal involvement. Ellis continued, until 1972, as head of the Bath Academy of Art. In this role, by developing a pioneering art syllabus and recruiting highly skilled artists as teachers, Ellis had a lasting influence on the development of many artists. Works by Ellis were included in the 1983 Landscape in Britain exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, the 1988 Art Deco Underground exhibition at the London Transport Museum and a retrospective of his work was held in 1989 at the Michael Parkin Gallery in London.

He was the founder and first dean of Cornell University School of Hotel Administration that was the first to teach college level hotel management courses.  Early life and education  Meek was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, on October 30, 1893. His parents were Warren Lee Meek and Eliza Fowler (Reed) Meek. His father worked in the manufacturing industry. Meek attended the Chelsea public schools while growing up and graduated from Chelsea High School. Meek obtained his B.S. in mathematics from Boston University in 1917. He earned his Master's degree from the University of Maine in 1920, and his doctorate in economics from Yale University in 1933. Boston University later awarded him an honorary degree of Doctorate of Science in Education in 1949.  Career  Meek created the first collegiate education in the field of hotel administration at Boston University in 1918. This prompted the American Hotel Association to suggest to Cornell University that he give instructions along these lines in a program that they would sponsor. The new course at first was a department in the College of Home Economics that Meek taught for a few years. At the age of 29, Meek founded the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration in 1922, becoming its first professor and dean. The first class had four courses that Meek taught 21 students. He was known as the \\"father of the Cornell Hotel School.\\" It was the first college level school established for the training of hotel managers. Meek attracted the support of American hotel executive Ellsworth M. Statler, founder of the Statler Hotels chain. He gave $10 million to finance Cornell's Statler Hall, a complex for the professional training of future hotel managers. Meek held the position of the Dean of Cornell University School of Hotel Administration for 39 years until he retired in 1961. At that time it was an independent college with a staff of over three dozen lecturers. Toward the end of his teaching career he established a research department at the Cornell Hotel School to serve the hotel industry. He was also influential in establishing a publications department there which prints training manuals, textbooks and magazines. Other countries worldwide have adopted Meek's courses. At the time of Meek's death, the school had five hundred full-time students, of which about 15 percent came from outside the United States. By 1975, the school had three thousand graduates.  Societies and professional affiliations  Meek held various positions in societies associated with the hotel industry. He was an honorary life member of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, the National Restaurant Association, the New York State Hotel Association and the Club Managers Association of America. He was also a consultant member for various associations and companies including the New York State Minimum Wage Board for the Hotel Industry, the American Statistical Association, the Ithaca Reconstruction Home Association, the American Economics Association, Cornell Society of Hotelmen, Ye Hosts, Point IV, AID Programs, and the Tompkins County Hospital. Honors and awards Meek was the E.M. Statler Professor emeritus. In 1969 he received two honors for his 50 years of service to the industry: the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University library, the first and largest library collection of hotel and food service reference material, was named the Howard B. Meek Library, and the Howard B. Meek Visiting Professorship was established at Cornell University by the Cornell Society of hotel men.  Personal life  Meek married Lois Ann Farmer of Minneapolis in 1924. She was a lecturer at the College of Home Economics and taught food management in hotel administration for several years after they were married. They had two children, Lois Jean Meek and Donald Bagnall Meek. Meek went by the nickname \\"Don\\" to those that knew him. Meek died of a heart attack on July 16, 1969, at his summer home in Pocasset, Massachusetts. His wife died in February 1973.

Lieftinck, was a Dutch academic specialising in medieval European manuscripts. Personal life The eldest of two boys and three girls, Lieftinck was born in Amsterdam in 1902 to Gerard Lieftinck (1875‚Äì1957), an entrepreneur and director of the tobacco brokerage J.H. Lieftinck & Son, and his wife Elisabeth Esser (1878‚Äì1963). He married twice, had two sons, and died in Deventer in 1994. Education and career From 1920 to 1925 Lieftinck studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam. Thereafter he switched to Dutch literature which remained his focus until he completed his studies in 1931; his first article, about fifteenth century Dutch mystic Hendrik Mande, appeared shortly thereafter. In 1936 Lieftinck successfully defended his doctoral dissertation on the Middle Dutch Tauler manuscripts. After commencing his career as a volunteer at the library of the School of Economics in Rotterdam, Lieftinck worked at the University of Amsterdam, at Koninklijke Bibliotheek, and at Leiden University, becoming Keeper of Manuscripts at the latter institution in 1942. In 1948 he was appointed Lector in Medieval Manuscripts at Leiden University. The post was upgraded to Professor of Palaeography and Manuscripts in 1963, making him only the second person to teach in that field at Leiden (the first being S.G. de Vries, who held the post from 1909 to 1931). Lieftinck's inaugural lecture at Leiden, Paleografie en Handschriftenkunde (Amsterdam, 1963), outlined ‚Äúhow palaeography, once considered ‚Äòancilla philologiae‚Äô, ha[d] become an autonomous science, and how it ha[d] moved ‚Ä¶ towards codicology of the medieval book‚Äù. He held the position until his retirement in 1972, whereupon he was succeeded by J. P. Gumbert. Lieftinck participated in the founding of the prestigious , Comit√© International de Pal√©ographie Latine, and played an important role in the design and implementation of the Catalog of Dated and Datable Manuscripts, a centrally important resource for codicologists. A member of , Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) from 1961, and a foreign member of , Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgi√´ voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten (Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts) from 1964, Lieftinck became his generation's principal authority in all matters relating to the Dutch and Latin manuscripts of the Netherlands. He published dozens of articles and books in Dutch, French, and English on topics in manuscript studies and palaeography. The Free University of Brussels, where he occasionally lectured from 1965 through 1971, awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1959. The first four volumes of the series Litterae Textuales (1: Varia Codicologica; 2: Texts and Manuscripts; 3: Neerlandica Manuscripta; 4: Miniatures, Scripts, Collections) were published in his honour.

In several of his publications on economics, particularly in The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business (1933), the result of a decade's investigation by Secrist and his assistants of 49 department stores and of businesses in 73 other fields, he argued that over time, competitive forces under free enterprise cause the success of better-run businesses to decline and that of weaker businesses to increase, leading to an inevitable predominance of mediocrity in American business;\\"Mediocrity Brands Business Life Of Nation, Economist Finds‚ÄîToo Many in Trade, All Held To Average, He Asserts\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, July 3, 1933, p. 6: \\"So long as competition is free, neither superiority nor inferiority will tend to persist.

Mathematical statistician Harold Hotelling pointed out in a review, and in a subsequent rebuttal of Secrist's response, that this argument constituted a misunderstanding of regression to the mean, which ensured the observed effect given the method of grouping of the observed results that Secrist had used.Stephen M.

Ali descended from the house of the Banu Ammar, which was known more for its learning than its warfare. The dynasty had been founded by his uncle, Amin al-Dawla Abu Talib al-Hasan ibn Ammar, who as qadi of Tripoli had declared himself independent from the Fatimid Caliphate in 1070. Ali came to power in Tripoli after his uncle's death in 1072, after a brief succession struggle with his brother, whom he expelled from the city. He was able to maintain his precarious independence by playing the Fatimids off the Seljuks. In 1081, he captured Jableh from the Byzantine Empire. Under Ali's reign, the First Crusade came to the Levant. Following the Siege of Antioch, the Crusaders began to make their way down to Jerusalem in early 1099. Soon, the party of Raymond IV approached Tripoli. Fearing the advancing Crusaders, he attempted to strike an alliance with them. However, due to the prosperity of Tripoli and the surrounding countryside, Raymond wished to make Tripoli his subject rather than his ally. He soon began the Siege of Arqa, while encouraging Raymond of Pilet and Raymond, Viscount of Turenne to capture Tortosa, a subject of Ali's, as well, which they did. The Siege of Arqa, which lasted from 14 February to 13 May 1099, was a failure, and Raymond was eventually persuaded to leave the city in the hands of Tripoli. As the Crusaders approached Ali's capital, he attempted to buy his immunity. He offered 300 Christian captives, compensating them with 15,000 bezants and 15 horses. The Crusaders left Tripoli untouched on 16 May. Ali did not live to see the long Siege of Tripoli, being succeeded by his brother Fakhr al-Mulk.

Location  The town of Guise and its fortress is on high ground on the west bank of the river Oise, in the Aisne d√©partement, in France's most northern region. It is about west of the nearest major town, Saint-Quentin, and about east of the border with Belgium.  History  It is at the medieval castle, first built with timbers in the 10th century and later in the 12th century rebuilt with the local stones. The castle is dominated by the keep. In the 16th century the dukes of Guise allowed the construction of one of Northern Europe's biggest bastions, which would later attract the attention of Vauban.

Early life and education  Beverly Barkat was born in 1966 in Johannesburg, South Africa to Louis and Lorna Sakalovsky, both artists themselves. In 1976, the family immigrated to Israel. She finished her studies at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in 1990, earning a BFA from the Department of Metalsmithing and Jewellery Design. Art career In 1995, Barkat worked in glass art in the Czech Republic and was invited to participate in an international glassblowing and sculpting symposium. From 2006 to 2009, Barkat studied painting in Israel Hershberg's Master Class at the Jerusalem Studio School. She took part in the JSS Summer Program in Italy twice, studying and participating in workshops alongside artists Lennart Anderson, Stuart Shils, and Raoul Middleman. Barkat experimented with new materials and architectural spaces. She dedicated herself to architectural projects such as the building and renovation of private homes, as well as communal spaces and libraries in elementary schools to improve the educational climate. In 2009 Barkat opened her own studio in Jerusalem. Her works have been presented internationally, in group and solo exhibitions.  Work  Barkat‚Äôs early paintings were largely figurative and in keeping with the traditional Western genres. #173 from the Japanese series, Kyoto City International Foundation Curators' Award 2014. Around 2009, her paintings took a turn towards formal abstraction, with influences of Cubism and Abstract Expressionism from her formative years becoming more apparent. Although she continued to draw from life, she started to deconstruct the figure and at the same time, capture movement on a two-dimensional surface with dynamic lines. In 2014, her set of paintings were inspired by Japanese calligraphy. She was awarded the Curator's Award at the 28th International Exhibition of Art & Design in Kyoto, Japan. Barkat started experimenting with new techniques, application methods and materials, the most prominent being the use of transparent PVC sheets as support for her paintings. These she paints in a manner reminiscent of action painting. Sally Haftel Naveh, the curator of her 2017 exhibition in Venice, comments on her use of this new material in the exhibition catalogue: ‚ÄúThe PVC sheets that Barkat picks for her paintings differ from other more conventional supports first and foremost in their transparency, so that while each side carries its own self-contained painterly motif, it echoes at the same time the one found overleaf. The work process progresses on both sides simultaneously, in constant symbiosis, free of any predetermined precepts or hierarchies.‚Äù The centrepiece of her 2017 site- specific exhibition entitled Evocative Surfaces, supported by Outset Contemporary Art Fund and exhibited at Palazzo Grimani in Venice, were 12 large PVCs hung from the ceiling. Their abstract and colourful surfaces interacted with the light and the architectural surroundings of the stately Venetian edifice. Evocative Surfaces exhibition, Museo di Palazzo Grimani, Venice 2017.In 2018 Barkat held her second institutional exhibition in Italy, at Museo Boncompagni Ludovisi in Rome. The exhibition, titled After the Tribes, was curated by Dr. Giorgia Calo, who explains in the exhibition catalogue: \\"After the Tribes presents itself as a large abstract, three- dimensional trompe-l‚Äô≈ìil that dialogues with the mural paintings of the tree- lined all√©es and gardens of Villa Ludovisia, painted on the walls of the Salone delle Vedute, where the installation is located. After the Tribes projects the spectator into another dimension, in which space is annulled and we find ourselves in an imaginary place, one that evokes a story reaching back across the millennia.\\" Exhibition After the Tribes has been supported by Polo Museale del Lazio, Embassy of Israel in Italy and Nomas Foundation.

The rule is part of the conflict of laws rules developed at common law, and forms part of the act of state doctrine. In State of Colorado v. Harbeck 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) the court referred to In England, Lord Denning MR said in Att-Gen of New Zealand v Ortiz [1984] AC 1 at 20: The rule has been repeatedly applied in the United Kingdom,Government of India v Taylor [1955] AC 491 the United States,Moore v. Mitchell, 30 F.2d 600, 600 (2d Cir. 1929) Canada,United States v. Harden [1963] SCR 366 Australia,Jamieson v Commissioner for Internal Revenue [2007] NSWSC 324 Ireland,Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey [1954] Ir 89 Singapore,Relfo Limited v Varsani [2008] SGHC 105 and other countries. It has also been codified into statute in various countries. History of the rule The earliest reported case on the rule is believed to be Attorney General v Lutwydge (1729) Bumb 280, 145 ER 674. In that case, the English courts refused to enforce a bond for Scottish tobacco duties. In 1775 Lord Mansfield CJ pronounced in Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343, 98 ER 1120 at 1121 that \\"no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another\\". In 1779 he repeated that position in Planche v Fletcher (1779) 1 Douglas 251, 99 ER 164. English law Although the rule had been referred to an applied in a number of English cases from as early as 1729,Cases where the rule was applied or referred to include: Municipal Council of Sydney v Bull [1909] 1 KB 7; King of the Hellenes v Brostrom [1923] 16 Lloyd‚Äôs List LR 190; Queen of Holland v Drukker [1928] 1 Ch 877 and Re Visser [1928] Ch 877. the rule itself was not considered beyond doubt in England until the decision of the House of Lords in Government of India v Taylor [1955] AC 491. In that case the House of Lords unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal (who had in turn unanimously upheld the trial judge) that the liquidator of an English company could not pay out sums to a foreign government because the tax claim was not justiciable in England. The rule as it applies under English law is summarised in Dicey Morris & Collins at Rule 3: In Re State of Norway's Application (No 2) [1990] 1 AC 723 the Norwegian government sought assistance from the English courts in collecting evidence in relation to a tax claim. The respondent resisted the application on the basis that it violated the revenue rule, but the House of Lords held that assisting with the collection of evidence would not violate the rule. Lord Goff said \\"It is of importance to observe that that rule is limited to cases of direct or indirect enforcement in this country of the revenue laws of a foreign state. It is plain that the present case is not concerned with the direct enforcement of the revenue laws of the State of Norway. Is it concerned with their indirect enforcement? I do not think so.\\" In QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual provision between two private contracting parties for an indemnity against the payment of foreign taxes would not constitute an indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim, and so was enforceable. United States The revenue rule has been repeatedly applied by courts in the United States. The rule was first applied in the United States in 1806 in Ludlow v. Van Rensselaer 1 Johns. R. 94 (N.Y. 1806). Initially the rule was also applied to claims for taxes made by other states within the US. In Maryland v. Turner 132 N.Y. 173, 174 (1911) the courts of New York state refused to enforce a judgment debt relating to taxes due in Maryland. In Colorado v. Harbeck 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) it was held that there was a \\"well-settled principle of private international law which precludes one state from acting as a collector of taxes for a sister state and from enforcing its penal or revenue laws as such. The rule is universally recognized that the revenue laws of one state have no force in another.\\" However, in Moore v. Mitchell 30 F.2d 600, 600 (2d Cir. 1929) the U.S. Supreme Court limited the application of the rule in the interstate context. In Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co. 296 U.S. 268, 268 (1935) the Supreme Court was asked to consider whether revenue laws of other states should be enforced under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The Supreme Court declined to extend the full faith and credit provision to revenue statutes themselves, but limited its ruling to enforcement of tax judgments handed down in the courts of other states. Canada The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld and applied the revenue rule in United States v. Harden [1963] SCR 366. Civil law jurisdictions Civil law (as opposed to common law) jurisdictions will not generally entertain foreign tax claims on the basis that they are public laws, and therefore cannot be enforced outside of the state or territory. In the Swedish case of Bulgariska Staten v Takvorian (NJA 1954 s.268) the court held \\"a state cannot use a Swedish court to collect taxes or to have other contributions made to a foreign state\\". Criticism The rule has been subjected to criticism. Professor Adrian Briggs of Oxford University has criticised it on the basis that it promotes the evasion of tax liabilities. Another commentator has called it \\"anachronistic and destructive\\". But other commentators have defended it, both as a matter of practice and principle. Abrogation Nations can, and do, abrogate the rule on a bilateral basis by treaty. In the English courts enforced a claim for South African taxes under a bilateral treaty between the countries. However, whilst treaties to share information relating to taxable liabilities are common, or for relief from double taxation, treaties empowering nations to enforce each other's tax law are relatively uncommon. Brenda Mallinak records that in 2006 the United States had only five such treaties, despite having a large number of international treaties for tax information exchange.

History  After the Satyam scandal took place in 2009, the Standing Committee on Finance proposed the concept of the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) for the first time in its 21st report. Companies Act, 2013 then gave the regulatory framework for its composition and constitution. The Union Cabinet approved the proposal for its establishment on 1 March 2018. The establishment of NFRA as an independent regulator for the auditing profession will improve the transparency and reliability of financial statements and information presented by listed companies and large unlisted companies in India.  Powers & duties  According to Section 132 of Companies Act 2013, \\"NFRA is responsible for recommending accounting and auditing policies and standards in the country, undertaking investigations, and imposing sanctions against defaulting auditors and audit firms in the form of monetary penalties and debarment from practice for up to 10 years.\\" Pursuant to the NFRA Rules, 2018, the powers of the NFRA were extended to include the governing of auditors of companies listed in any stock exchange, in India or outside of India, unlisted public companies above certain thresholds, and other companies specified in Rule 3 (1) therein. Rules 7 and 8 allow for the monitoring of accounting and auditing professionals of the companies referred to in Rule 3 (1). Companies under Rule 3 (2) and 3 (3) are required to disclose information of their auditors to the NFRA through form NFRA-1. Officeholders NFRA consists of one chairman, three full-time members and one secretary. Rangachari Sridharan was appointed as the first chairman of the body in October 2018.

By recording how coherent speckle fluctuations in time, one can measure a time correlation function, and thus measure the timescale processes of interest (diffusion, relaxation, reorganization, etc.). XPCS is used to study the slow dynamics of various equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes occurring in condensed matter systems.  Advantages  XPCS experiments have the advantage of providing us with the information of dynamical properties of materials (e.g. vitreous materials), while other experimental techniques can only provide information about the static structure of the material. This technique is based on the generation of a speckle pattern by the scattered coherent light originating from a material where some spatial inhomogeneities are present. A speckle pattern is a diffraction limited structure factor, and is typically observed when laser light is reflected from a rough surface, or from dust particles performing Brownian motion in air. The observation of speckle patterns with hard X-rays has just been demonstrated in the last few years. This observation is only possible now because of the development of new synchrotron radiation X-ray sources that can provide sufficient coherent flux.  aXPCS  A specific subgroup of these techniques are the atomic-scale X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (aXPCS) References  Sources  * P.-A.

Beside the monasteries Agios Dionysios and Kanalon it is one of the monasteries located at Mount Olympus.  Location  The monastery is situated in the west of Mountain at a height of 990 m near the municipality of Elassona.  History  The exact date of the foundation is not known. Records, however, prove that the monastery was inhabited since at least 1386. It is a stauropegic monastery, subordinated directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople (Istanbul). The monastery's heyday began in the early 17th century, with its climax in the second half of the 18th century. The church was renovated in 1633. The oldest, very well-preserved icons come from this period. The cells of the monks were completed around 1739. The monastery became self-sufficient and had the financial resources to engage in external affairs. The most difficult years were these of the Ottoman reign. The monastery was one of the liturgical schools of Orthodox Christianity as well as schools in Thessaloniki, Constantinople or Venice. Particularly educated monks not only ensured that the Greek language remained alive, but also educated the population. A library and a study room were set up, the bookbinding workshop was practiced by experienced monks from the 17th to the 19th century. Many of the manuscripts and books of that period were saved and are located in the Monastery of Panagia Olympiotissa.http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1553http://www.religiousgreece.gr/monasteria/-/asset_publisher/0bMEUXPQRK0A/content/mone- panagias-olympiotissas Some examples are exhibited in the museum. During the Greek War of Independence against Ottoman rule the monastery supported the Greek fighters. Because of its location, far from the Turkish administration in Elassona, the monks could act relatively freely. They hid fighters and ammunition, cared for clothes and provisions. From the middle of the 19th century the slow decline began, and in the second decade of the 20th century the last monks left the monastery. For about 80 years it was closed. On the initiative of the Metropolitan of Elassona, Basileios, the reconstruction began. In 2000, the first monks once again moved into the monastery.  The monastery  The refectory A tower overlooks the high exterior walls, which are interrupted only by small, barred windows on the upper floors. In the northern part, four powerful retaining walls reinforce the statics of the outer wall, which is about one meter thick. The ground plan is a pentagon, the church (katholikon) is the central building. The monks' cells and other rooms like the refectory are laid out around the church. The wooden entrance door is covered with iron and is very stable. To the inside of the monastery, the rooms of the second storey are supported by columns. Architecturally this way colonnades are formed, surrounding the church. Benches invite the visitor to rest. From the colonnades are the entrances to the museum and the small shop of the monks, as well as to the areas not accessible to the visitor of the monastery. A small, very old well on the south side, donates holy water. In the south-west you can find the semantron and the bell-tower of the monastery. By hitting the semantron with a hammer, the monks are called to prayer. Four chapels belong to the property, of which the chapel of Saint Charalambos is located on the site of the monastery. The chapel of All Saints, the chapel of the Theotokos and the chapel dedicated to John the Baptist are outside the grounds.  The church  Icon from 1633 The church is 23 meters long, seven meters wide and the external walls are one meter thick. It is a simple, straight building, covered with natural stones and bricks. It consists of the narthex, the church room and the altar room, accessible only to the priests. The small windows lay the paintings, the carvings, the icons in a half-dark. All the walls are painted with biblical motifs or motifs of saints. The ceiling is made of wood and is shaped into different patterns, painted in different colors. Several chandeliers with wax candles hang from the ceiling. They are decorated with porcelain bowls and ostrich eggs. The floor is made of marble with inlays. The door to the altar room was adorned with gilded wood carvings and icons. The carvings of the iconostasis are pure craftsmanship. Some of the icons are more recent because the old originals were stolen.  The museum  On quite a few square meters many exhibits are shown. Precious robes, the oldest icons of the monastery from the year 1633 and books, which were partly bound here. Old silver vessels used during the liturgy, precious embroidery and documents, which are witnesses of the monastery's history, are exhibited.

Florence was the second of six children born of the marriage of Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, a prominent physician, abolitionist and founder of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind, and Julia Ward Howe, a poet and author, best known for writing \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". Her elder sister was Julia Romana Howe;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe, page 141. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003 and her younger siblings included Henry Marion Howe, a metallurgist; Laura (n√©e Howe) Richards and Maud (n√©e Howe) Elliott, both authors;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe, page 11. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003 Her younger sister Maud married John Elliott, an English muralist and illustrator. She was educated at private schools in Boston and nearby, including the Agassiz School of Cambridge. She later studied music with Otto Dresel, the pianist, music teacher and composer. Career She was a writer, critic, and lecturer about women's suffrage in the United States, serving as president of the New Jersey State Woman Suffrage Association from 1893 to 1900. Hall began her writing career with children's stories, but quickly moved on to memoirs and etiquette books. She was the author of Social Customs: Boys, Girls and Manners, The Correct Thing in Good Society, Social Usages at Washington, which she wrote with her sister Maud Elliot. In 1917, Hall received a Pulitzer prize for her biography of her mother, entitled Julia Ward Howe, the first Pulitzer Prize for a biography. Along with her sisters, she also wrote a biography of Laura Bridgeman, who was a student of their father's. For eleven years, Hall served as president of the Plainfield, New Jersey branch of the National Alliance of Unitarian Women and, for several years, regent of the Continental Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Personal life On November 15, 1871, she was married to David Prescott Hall (1845‚Äì1907). David, a lawyer, was the youngest son of six children born to David Priestley Hall, a Harvard educated lawyer, and Caroline (n√©e Minturn) Hall, who spent their summers in Newport, Rhode Island. The couple met while Hall was in Newport and had four children: * Samuel Prescott Hall (1872‚Äì1958), who married Sarah Thomson (1873‚Äì1940). He was a graduate of Harvard. * Caroline Minturn Hall (1874‚Äì1972), who married the Rev. Hugh Birckhead (1876‚Äì1929), Rector of St. George's Church in Manhattan. Caroline studied painting for seven years in Paris. * Henry Marion Hall (1877‚Äì1963), who married Alice Louise Haskell (1880‚Äì1977). He was a graduate of Harvard and Columbia University. * John Howe Hall (1881‚Äì1953), who married Gertrude Earnshaw (1892‚Äì1964). He was a graduate of Harvard. In New York City, they lived at 17 Livingston Place. In 1893, the Halls moved to Plainfield, New Jersey, where he died at his home on June 5, 1907. Florence died on April 10, 1922 in High Bridge, New Jersey. She was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Kollegiengeb√§ude II was built during the early 1960s. The Platz der Alten Synagogue (Old Synagogue Square) is a square in Freiburg, Germany. With a size of 130 square metres, it is the second largest square in the city after Minster Square. The square is named after the old synagogue, which was destroyed during the Kristallnacht in 1938. The synagogue had been built in 1869/1870 to the southwest of today's location of the square. The Stadttheater and the Kollegiengeb√§ude II of the University of Freiburg are located on the square. To the south on Sedanstra√üe is the Platz der Universit√§t, where the Kollegiengeb√§ude I and the University Library are located. From 1927 to 1939 and after 1945 until the 1980s, the entire area between Bertold Stra√üe and Belfort Stra√üe was named Werthmannplatz until the former synagogue site became Europaplatz. The Platz der Universit√§t has been so called since 2007. During the Rotteckring project, the square was redesigned in 2016. On the north‚Äìsouth axis, the street crossing to the inner city centre has been replaced by tram tracks and the previous lawn area replaced by continuous pavement. The newly designed square opened on 2 August 2017.  History  = Bastions, Ramparts and Rempartstra√üe = In the 17th century, Freiburg was extended by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban to a fortress on behalf of the French King Louis XIV. In the area of today's square were the Bastion Dauphin (later Bastei St. Leopold) and a rampart, which connected them with the Bastion de la Reyne (later Bastei Kaiserin) and her subsequent successor Kaiser-Bastei. At the last two's locations, there is now a University Mensa and Holzmarkt.Heinrich Schreiber: Der Schlo√überg bei Freiburg: historisches Gem√§lde ; mit einem Belagerungs-Plane der Stadt Freiburg vom Jahre 1744 und einer perspektivischen Ansicht des damaligen untern Schlosses. Wangler, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1844, S. 42, (Digitalisat). Until their departure on 29 April 1745, as a result of the Treaty of F√ºssen, the French blew up the bulk of their fortifications, but used the remaining Earthworks (archaeology) as shelters. In spite of doubling the number of inhabitants during the following decades, it was not until 1845 that Freiburg's train station, which had been built outside the old part of the city, was opened. The railway line from Offenburg, which ended there, led to a western extension of the city beyond its former fortifications. The design developed by Josephy Roesch, was approved by the Upper Rhine government on 29 March 1846, opening the way for new roads to the Wiehre village as well as between the station and the old town. After 1863, Ludwig Klehe, owner of the Hammerwerk Gaggenau, built a mansion on Bertholdstra√üe and later Rempartstra√üe on the site of the former Leopold Bastei,Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1863, p. 95 (Bauplatz).Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1863, p. 126 (erste Wohnung).Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1863, p. 95 (fertig). where Heinrich von Stein also lived in 1869. The Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft, also founded in 1863, acquired the later site at Rempartstra√üe 15 at the end of the decade, to build a synagogue there.Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1871, p. 50. Since the mayor's office had planned to abolish the rampart and convert it into a road, the community undertook necessary construction measures to carry out the building of the new synagogue, such as embankments and stairs. In the autumn of 1869, the synagogue was built within a year by plans laid out by Georg Jakob Schneider, who had already designed plans for the Colombischl√∂ssle (1859/1860), whose location was the Bastion Saint Louis. The building to the south of the synagogue was built in 1777/1778 or 1781 as a former garrison court in the place of the \\"Fauler Pelz\\" house and was converted into a breeding house at the start of the 19th century. In 1868, before the later correctional facility was completed, it became the Rampart barracks. In keeping with the name of the barracks, Rempartstra√üe was constructed as far back as 1866 from parts of the rampart,Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1865, p. 71.Badenschen Hauptstadt Freyburg im Breisgau, sammt einem Kalender 1810, p. 100. which was first included in address books across Freiburg from as early as 1810. However, the majority of Rempartstra√üe was located in the Breisacher Tor area, the other part of which was integrated into the new Gardenstra√üe.Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1866, p. 76. At the same time, Bertholdstra√üe was named after the Jesuitengasse and the former use of high schools and the university.Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1865, p. 69.Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1866, p. 74. The continuation of Rempartstra√üe on the opposite side of Bertholdstra√üe was called Rotteckstra√üe from 1865. From 1867, the area, like the rest of the city, was given house numbers starting from the top of the street,Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1867, p. 50. instead of the numbering that had previously taken place across four city districts.Freiburger Adre√ü- Kalender 1866, p. 84. = Werderstra√üe = Aided by the economic upturn after the founding of the German Reich and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, several streets were built to the west of Rempartstra√üe, a name still existing today. They were named after the Siege of Belfort, the Battle of Sedan, General Field Marshall Helmuth von Moltke and the German Kaiser Wilhelm I. Rempartstra√üe itself became part of Werderstra√üe. This street, named after the Prussian general August von Werder, was built in 1876 to link the Gartenstra√üe bridge (later replaced by Friedrich's Bridge and Kronen Bridge) with Berholdstra√üe, which replaced a wooden bridge over the Dreisam in 1869. A memorial to the General also has been reminiscent of the former Villa Klehe since 1874. It was acquired by Wilhelm August Platenius around 1873,Freiburger Adre√ü-Kalender 1873, p. 115 the first board of the Deutsche Bank, founded in 1870. In addition, the Werderstra√üe, more precisely the Alleegarten on the site of the former Bastei Kaiserin, was one of the discarded potential sites for the Siegesdenkmal unveiled in 1876, with whom, in addition to the XIV Corps, Werder was also honoured as its leader. From 1872 to 1874, the Oberrealschule, later known as the Rotteck-Gymnasium, was built next to the Villa Platenius and Sedanstra√üe in accordance with plans developed by Heinrich Lang. Recent Changes In 2000, the artist group B√ºro f√ºr ungew√∂hnliche Ma√ünahmen arranged a yellow signpost resembling a traffic sign, showing the inscription ‚ÄúGurs 1027 km.‚Äú The memorial was authorized by the city administration only after it was hung up and it is a reminder of the Jewish people that were deported in 1940 as part of the Wagner-B√ºrckel-Aktion. Among them were more than 400 people from or near Freiburg. A tile explanations supplemented the sign. In other Baden and Palatine cities, there are comparable Gurs-memorials, for instance in Mannheim, Bruchsal or Ludwigshafen. =Plans for restructuring= At the end of 2004, the city administration of Freiburg organized a two-day Planungswerkstatt Platz der Alten Synagog (planning workshop for the Old Synagogue Square). The purpose of this workshop was developing suggestions and concepts for a reconstruction, as well as coming up with ideas for future utilization. On March 21, 2006, the local council of Freiburg proposed the reconstruction of the Old Synagogue Square and called for proposals for the new design. The participants were asked to come up with concepts for the urban development, but also to think about a way of capturing ‚Äúthe topic ‚ÄôOld Synagogue‚Äò in a draft with creative and artistic means.‚Äú With this, the ‚Äúmemory and information of the Old Synagogue as well as the former and respectively present life of the Jewish community in the city‚Äú was to be considered.‚Äú and ‚ÄúThe concept of the area of the Old Synagogue should harbor a calm atmosphere. At the same time it should represent a place of getting together (Knesset).‚Äú The chosen draft of architects Volker Rosenstiel and Matin Schedlbauer was modified multiple times in the following years. The square was intended to remain as a wide open space between the theatre and the university. The second biggest square in the city was said to no longer be experienced as such, because it was divided by a traffic ring. This is why it was decided that the square should regain its old function of connecting the theater and the university. The city council argued that a reconstruction to connect the former street to the theatre's courtyard had, therefore, become necessary. The existing monument was supposed to remain. Furthermore, a water basin of the size, outline, and exact location of the old synagogue was meant to serve as a memorial. In the Spring of 2006, the university's building authorities, as a representative of the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, also initiated a contest in order to reconstruct the university library. The almost completely new constructed library, based on a winning draft by the Basler architectural office Deglo Architekten, was opened in October 2017. In 2007, on the occasion of the university's anniversary, the remaining part of the Werthmannplatz was renamed Platz der Universit√§t (University Square). In order to keep honoring Werthmann with a street name, the Werderring was renamed Werthmannstra√üe.‚Äù =Modifications= As part of the project Stadtbahn und Umgestaltung am Rotteckring (Tram and Redesign of Rotteckring), the construction work started in 2012 and is supposed to be finished by 2018. In a local council sitting of 2013 further changes of the plan were discussed and immediately criticised by members of the professional association of architects. After previous changes of the plan in 2010, further changes were made. Instead of rebuilding the theatre courtyard the city introduced plans for urban gardening there. The rebuilding officially began in 2016. Shortly afterwards new tram tracks were built and connected to previously existing ones. Other tracks are in construction, however, the drafts had to be changed due to interference with an already existing tram station. The landmark Rotteckring is being stored in a warehouse during construction. Another landmark, die Liegende, previously to be found on the Old Synagogue Square, has been positioned in one of the buildings of the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. A memorial plaque for the destroyed synagogue has been placed at the newly installed fountain where the synagogue used to be. In September 2016, remains of the synagogue's foundation were found during the earthworks for the synagogue-shaped fountain. This was followed by a public debate about whether or not to change plans in order to visibly preserve the stones. The debate was ended by a local council order on November 15, 2016 and the remaining fragments were covered with geotextile and filled with soil in order to prepare the foundation of the fountain. By the beginning of November some of the exposed stones had already been removed. A decision on what to do with the remaining stones was to be made by the spring of 2018. For that purpose 40,000 Euros had been granted over a period of two years. A water chamber was installed in the subsoil. In March 2017, a plane tree was planted on the square (because one was damaged and chopped down during the construction works), as well as nine honey locusts. They received a subterrestrial irrigation system. Originally, it was planned to plant Spaeth's alder trees (Alnus spaethii), which unfortunately bore a too high allergy risk. Since the construction works were faster than anticipated, the square was inaugurated three months earlier than planned, on August 2., 2017. Among the 3,000 granit plates, which come from a quarry in the Bavarian Forest National Park, 12 water nozzles are installed on the square, which emit 1,5m high water fountains. The wooden platforms surrounding the big trees were not originally planned Because the former meadow, surrounded by sandstone walls, was half a meter (about 20 inches) above the surrounding streets, the roots of the trees are now above the level of the square. The square is ‚Äò‚Äôthe biggest uncommercial seating area in the city center,‚Äô‚Äô says the leader of the Garten- und Tiefbauamt Frank Uekermann. The square can withstand up to 30,000 kilograms. However, the problem posed by the lack of parking spots for bicycles has still not been solved yet. The costs for the reconstruction did not exceed 9,4 million euros. Around the end of July, test runs of the memorial fountain, which showed a completely flat, mirror-like surface, were started. Big granite tiles are still missing on the south side of the square, because it interferes with the access road to the Platz der Weissen Rose, which is used to access the construction site of the second main building of the Albert-Ludwig University. In 2019, there will be an access road between the synagogue fountain and the university's first main building to the \\"Platz der wei√üen Rose\\" for the construction site by the second main building of the Albert-Ludwig University. Only after the renovations are done will the tiles be placed. When the Gurs memorial with an explanatory sign was to be put back onto the square there were disagreements about its location: The city administration wanted it to be placed on the south-west corner of the square, close to the memorial fountain, others preferred its old location on the Bertoldstrasse. At the end of March it was attached to a lamppost west of the memorial fountain and the explanatory sign was embedded in a stone tile underneath it. As of November 2017 two boards which inform about the former synagogue and request an appropriate behaviour were placed next to the memorial fountain, since people had been using it as a paddling pool. =Debate on the square's name= In 2016 the historian Bernd Martin, chairman of the Kommission zur √úberpr√ºfung der Freiburger Stra√üennamen, suggested to change the square's name from Platz der Alten Synagoge (Old Synagogue Square) to Platz der Zerst√∂rten Synagoge (Square of the Destroyed Synagogue). His idea was supported by Freiburg's mayor Dieter Salomon. About a year later, the SPD fraction of the city council submitted a corresponding request to the mayor. In their opinion, the name Old Synagogue Square hides the fact that the synagogue was destroyed by the National Socialists with the intention to annihilate Freiburg's Jewish community. In contrast, however, the Jewish community opposed the renaming. On 18 September 2017, the city council dropped the renaming request.

He is best known as the main perpetrator of the Murdering Gully massacre which occurred in 1839 along Mount Emu Creek near Mount Noorat. This massacre resulted in the deaths of about 40 men, women and children of the Tarnbeere gundidj clan of the Djargurd Wurrung people. Taylor was also involved in other shooting deaths of Aboriginal people near Geelong and Lake Colac. After moving to Gippsland, he was involved in frontier conflict there with the Gunai people. Despite his responsibility for the killings being well known and well documented, Taylor was never convicted and enjoyed high esteem in British colonial society until his death in 1872. Early years and Arrival in Australia Frederick Taylor was born 25 December 1810 in England. He came to the Port Phillip region in Australia in March 1836 and not long after was overseer at Charles Swanston's Indented Head station. He seems to have had strong connections with notable British people in India such as Captain Swanston and George McKillop. Murder of Woolmudgin In October 1836, a head clansman of the Wathaurung named Woolmudgin (or Curacoine) came to Indented Head. Taylor mistakenly identified Woolmudgin as a person wanted for an armed attack. He tied Woolmudgin to a tree and placed a shepherd named John Whitehead as sentry while he went to notify the authorities. Whitehead later shot Woolmudgin and dumped his body in the Barwon River. Whitehead was arrested and Taylor was placed on a ¬£50 bond as a witness. At the subsequent trial, Taylor failed to appear and Whitehead was acquitted. Captain William Lonsdale wrote that he thought Taylor \\"entertained a strong suspicion that he had given strong encouragement to the prisoner [Whitehead] to commit the murder\\". Taylor then avoided any further legal scrutiny by fleeing to Van Diemen's Land. Lake Colac shooting Frederick Taylor returned to the mainland in 1839 and appears to have briefly been a licensed squatter in the Port Fairy region. There is a record of Taylor in association with another man named Arthur Lloyd shooting an aboriginal man dead at Lake Colac in 1839. Murdering Gully Massacre Also in 1839, Taylor was appointed manager of George McKillop's and James Smith's Strathdownie station. In that year, having heard of an encampment of Tarnbeere gundidj and other people at a place called Puuroyuup within the station, Taylor went out to remove and punish them. While the Djargurd Wurrung people were asleep, Taylor with the aid of a number of shepherds and workers on horseback, formed a cordon around them and then fired at them indiscriminately. Somewhere between 35 and 40 men, women and children were killed. The bodies were thrown into waterholes, but were later removed and burnt due to survivors bringing attention to the scene by endeavouring to recover the corpses of their relatives from the waterholes. Some of the survivors included Larkikok, Woreguimoni, Karn, Benadug and Bareetch Chuurneen. Many of these people went to the nearby Buntingdale Wesleyan mission to seek refuge and report the crime. With interest from authorities mounting, Taylor again fled the colony, this time absconding onto an American whaling vessel that was moored in Portland Bay and sailing to India. Taylor was tried in absentia by Crown Prosecutor James Croke and although Taylor's role was of a \\"very suspicious nature\\" he was acquitted due to evidence from Aboriginal people being inadmissible. The massacre occurred on Taylor's Creek which was named after Frederick Taylor. It is notable that due to the killings, the creek was renamed Mount Emu Creek and the station itself was given a new title in 1840 of Glenormiston by its new owner Niel Black. South Asia Taylor spent the next few years in India and Ceylon, consolidating with contacts in the British Army and East India Company with a view to return to Australia and set up new squatting interests. These people were Richard Sterling Jones, John Davison Smith, John Michael Loughnan and Henry Nicholas Loughnan. The Loughnans became particularly close to Taylor. J.M. Loughnan was a Captain in the 10th Bengal Cavalry, Fort Adjutant at Fort William in Calcutta and aide-de-camp to Governor General Lord Auckland. After attaining enough influence and organisation, Taylor prepared to return to Australia, choosing the newly occupied Gippsland region to establish himself as a squatter. Gippsland In early 1842, Taylor arrived in the Monaro region of New South Wales with Richard Sterling Jones, William O'Dell Raymond and H.N. Loughnan with their flocks of sheep ready to overland into plains of Gippsland. Later that year they had established stations on Gunai land near modern-day Bairnsdale with Indian derived names such as Lindenow and Lucknow. Over the next fifteen years, Taylor was either overseer or license holder of a number of pastoral stations in that region including Deighton, Emu Vale, Swan Reach, Avon/Molly Plains and Lindenow. He was also assignee of Glencoe station. There were a number of massacres of Gunai people in this time period that involved groups of settlers shooting down Gunai people, but it is not clear if Frederick Taylor was directly associated. There are three incidents though where Gunai people took revenge on shepherds employed by Taylor. The first was in 1842, where a shepherd was killed on Taylor's Lindenow station; the second was in 1844 were two shepherds were killed on the same property; and the third was in 1847 on the Deighton holding where Gunai people were rushing the shepherds' huts. The first two occurred when there was minimal police presence in the region and therefore it was up to the squatters to enforce control. Records of punishment given out by Taylor are absent but given his background it is unlikely that punitive missions were not organised. The third incident was marked by Sergeant McLelland of the Native Police being called out to the station. On his return to the Green Hills police barracks near Boisdale he dispersed \\"20 blacks away\\". While in Gippsland, Taylor also advocated for the importation of coolie labour from India. In 1844 he endeavoured to bring some Indian coolie labourers over the Snowy Mountains and into Gippsland. They deserted en masse however due to Taylor treating them harshly. Taylor's reputation was again catching up with him, as the local Crown Commissioner, Captain Tyers, banned him from holding a pastoral license in 1844. However, due to pressure from his patrons in the Loughnan brothers, Taylor's ban was overturned in 1846. From this point on, Frederick Taylor no longer received any trouble from his past. In fact, to all intents and purposes, he became a successful and respected colonist. He became rich trading cattle and other livestock products out of Port Albert, wrote letters petitioning the Superintendent and advised other squatters on sheep washing innovations. Castlemaine By the mid 1850s, Taylor gradually removed his interests from Gippsland to the Mount Alexander goldfields area around modern day Castlemaine. Taylor's Paddock near Yapeen is named after him. His reputation in British colonial society apparently being so clean by this stage that he actually became a magistrate at Strathloddon and appeared as an expert witness at Legislative Council enquiries into mining and port related investigations. In 1858, Taylor was able to subdivide and sell much of his property around Castlemaine to gold miners. Elsternwick In 1864, Frederick Taylor finally sold out of all his pastoral interests and moved to Melbourne. He dissolved his association with the Loughnans and was paid out an astonishing amount of ¬£22,361. In 1868 he bought the prestigious Alfred Louis Smith designed Bonally house and acreage in Elsternwick. This property was five acres fronting onto Port Phillip with an exquisite ornamental garden. The house still exists as the Bonleigh residence on Bonleigh Avenue in Brighton and was recently valued at $6.5 million. Death and Legacy Taylor died on the 14th of February 1872 at the Bonally mansion. His obituary claims he was \\"an old and respected colonist\\". Taylor's total asset worth at his demise was ¬£23,105. He never married and did not have an heir. In his will he left Bonally to his associate H.N. Loughnan, who moved into the residence and lived there until 1877. Frederick Taylor is buried at St Kilda cemetery with an impressive headstone.

However, it then decided to expand its remit, admitting workers in related jobs, such as finishers, millers and scourers, and admit workers in other areas of Yorkshire and Lancashire. In recognition of this, it renamed itself as the Huddersfield, Bradford, Barnsley and District Dyers, Finishers, Millers, Scourers and Kindred Trades Association. The small Lancashire Cotton Skein Dyers Association merged with it in 1890, and by 1901, its membership had grown to 1,270.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B.

The Athletics coverage focuses on a mix of long-form journalism, original reporting, and in-depth analysis. Its business model is predicated on dis-aggregating the sports section of local newspapers and reaching non-local fans not reached by a local newspaper.

The Athletic relies on subscription revenue, not advertising revenue, to support the business. Mather and Hansmann believed sports fans would be willing to pay for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads. At the time, a few newspapers were trying out paywalls, but the common industry view was that information on the internet needed to be free.

Cantwell was featured prominently in a Vice News Tonight documentary about the rally and its participants, in which he is shown threatening to kill protesters, wielding rifles and a handgun, and joining fellow antisemitic conspiracy theorists in marching with tiki torches, chanting \\"Jews will not replace us!\\" Shortly after the rally, Cantwell published a video in which he wept while sharing that he had learned there was a warrant for his arrest.

The charges stemmed from Telegram messages Cantwell sent to a member of a rival neo-Nazi group, in which he threatened to rape the man's wife in front of his children if he did not give Cantwell information about the identity of another member of the group.  Life  Cantwell grew up in Stony Brook, New York. His father was an air traffic controller and his mother a homemaker. Cantwell has a younger brother as well as a half-brother and half-sister, both from a previous relationship of his father. He attended Ward Melville High School in East Setauket, New York. In 2012, Cantwell moved to Keene, New Hampshire. Cantwell has worked as an overnight technical support provider, and later started his own computer consulting business.  Ideology and politics  Cantwell has described himself as a member of the alt-right, a fascist, and a libertarian. The Anti-Defamation League includes Cantwell in its list of alt-right figures, and the Southern Poverty Law Center has profiled Cantwell, describing him as \\"an anti-Semitic, Alt-Right shock jock and an unapologetic fascist, who spews white nationalist propaganda with a libertarian spin\\". By Cantwell's own account, he was originally \\"radicalized\\" to libertarianism in 2009 after listening to a presentation by former Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik. In 2009 he announced he would be running as a Libertarian Party candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York's 1st District, but he did not collect enough signatures to get on the ballot. He has been repeatedly kicked out of libertarian organizations for his violent and racist views. Cantwell has held strong anti-police views, including advocating for violence against police officers. In a June 2012 Facebook post about police hypothetically attempting to pull over a driver, he said, \\"It is my honest opinion that this driver would be morally justified in shooting that police officer at the moment the [police car's] lights go on.\\" He was later removed from the Free State Project and banned from their events for this and other statements the group found to violate the libertarian non- aggression principle. Cantwell has posted photographs of himself dressed as a police officer who had been shot in the forehead for a 2014 Halloween party, and later that year he applauded the man who killed two police officers in New York City. Cantwell was a member of the Keene, New Hampshire-based voluntaryist protest group Free Keene, which is associated with the Free State Project. He and some other members objected to some actions of the Keene government which they considered to be examples of government over- involvement, such as the issuance of parking tickets. They filmed themselves harassing parking enforcement officers and walking ahead of the officers to pay expired meters, and uploaded many of their clips to YouTube. In 2014, Cantwell was one of three members of this \\"Free Keene Squad\\" who were featured in a mocking segment on The Colbert Report, which lampooned them as \\"brave patriots [who] are fighting back‚Ä¶ against government overreach\\" by harassing \\"meter maids\\". Over time, Cantwell has focused less on anti-police and anti- government positions, saying \\"I have become convinced that our problems are a lot more racial than anything... the police are not my biggest problem right now.\\" In March 2018, white supremacist and Internet troll Andrew Auernheimer, known online as weev, leaked a screenshot of an online conversation with Cantwell. In reply to a message from Auernheimer condemning other people for talking to police, Cantwell is shown saying \\"I talked to cops too, gonna talk to the feds soon most likely\\". Auernheimer replied to Cantwell to say \\"that's fucking shitty scumbag behavior,\\" and in the post accompanying the screenshot criticizes Cantwell for being \\"an admitted government informant\\" and describes the behavior as incompatible with Cantwell's calls for revolt. Soon after the leak, Cantwell published a blog post confirming that he was working with the government and claiming that he was doing so in an effort to get retribution at Antifa. The confirmation that he was working with law enforcement was met with anger from some members of the far-right. Although Cantwell endorsed Donald Trump for president in January 2016, he has said that he hoped for a leader who was \\"a lot more racist than Donald Trump\\" and who \\"does not give his daughter to a Jew\\" (referring to Ivanka Trump's marriage to Jared Kushner). = Unite the Right rally = Christopher Cantwell, pictured after being pepper-sprayed at the Unite the Right rally in August 2017 Cantwell participated in the Unite the Right rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 11‚Äì12, 2017. He was featured prominently in \\"Charlottesville: Race and Terror\\", an episode of Vice News Tonight about the rally and the groups who were present. He is first pictured marching through the University of Virginia campus among a group of white supremacists carrying tiki torches and chanting \\"Jews will not replace us.\\" He later is shown bragging about carrying guns, working out, and \\"trying to make [himself] more capable of violence,\\" later saying \\"We're not nonviolent. We'll fucking kill these people if we have to.\\"  Criminal charges and convictions  In 2000, at age 19, Cantwell pleaded guilty in Suffolk County, New York to driving while intoxicated (DWI), criminal possession of a weapon, and criminal possession of stolen property. He later told the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch, \\"I was involved in so much bullshit when I was a teenager, honestly, that like what I got caught for was the least of the shit I did.\\" He received a second DWI charge in 2009, and when he announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives he was facing a possible felony conviction and four years in jail for receiving two DWIs within ten years in New York. = Unite the Right-related charges = Following the Unite the Right rally, Cantwell was indicted in Albemarle County on three felony assault charges stemming from the August 11 torchlit march: two counts of illegal use of tear gas and one count of malicious bodily injury with a caustic substance. On August 16, 2017 Cantwell published a video of himself weeping while speaking about the warrant for his arrest, and his fears that he might be killed by police. The video went viral and earned him the nickname of \\"The Crying Nazi.\\" Cantwell turned himself in to police on August 24 and was transported to Charlottesville, where he was initially ordered to be held without bond. He was indicted on the tear gas charges in December, and paid $25,000 bail with funds donated by supporters on the white supremacist and neo-Nazi crowdfunding websites Hatreon and GoyFundMe. In March 2018, Cantwell was charged with public swearing and intoxication in Loudoun County, Virginia. He ultimately pleaded guilty to this misdemeanor and paid $116 in fees and court costs. Separately, prosecutors accused Cantwell of attempting to intimidate witnesses to the August assaults via his social media accounts, and the court imposed more stringent terms on Cantwell's bond. In October 2017, Cantwell was listed as a defendant in the federal civil suit against the organizers of the Unite the Right rally. Cantwell, who is representing himself in the trial, filed a plea which included a long quote from Adolf Hitler, who Cantwell described only as a \\"famous 20th century statesman\\". The trial, originally scheduled for autumn of 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2017, at the preliminary hearing for the felony assault case, the unlawful bodily injury charge was dismissed, with the court ruling that \\"so many people had pepper spray that night that some attacks could not be definitively attributed to Cantwell.\\" In July 2018, Cantwell entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor assault and battery for pepper spraying two people at the rally. He was sentenced to two concurrent jail sentences of one year with all but seven months suspended, and he was released from jail. As part of the sentence, Cantwell was required to leave Virginia within eight hours of the sentencing and was banned from returning to the state for five years. He was also banned from publicly discussing the two people he attacked at the rally. Two days after the sentencing, Cantwell made a thinly-veiled reference to the two victims in a social media post in which he boasted about \\"gassing\\" them. Cantwell pleaded guilty to violating of the terms of his pre-trial release by making the social media posts, and was fined $250. = Bowl Patrol-related charges = Since 2018, Cantwell has been involved in an ongoing feud with members of the Bowl Patrol, a loose group of white supremacists who name themselves after the bowl haircut of the perpetrator of the 2015 white supremacy-motivated Charleston church mass shooting. In April 2018, Cantwell had been the first guest on the Bowl Patrol's new podcast, but over the following months he fell out with the group and became a target of prank calls to his podcast, fake accounts pretending to be him, and music videos making fun of him. Cantwell made violent threats towards the group, and followed through on threats to contact law enforcement, including the FBI, about pranks perpetrated by its members. Prosecutors later alleged that Cantwell emailed law enforcement more than 50 times over a four-month period in 2019. In June 2019, Cantwell threatened a member of the Bowl Patrol who went by the pseudonym \\"CheddarMane\\", saying he would rape his wife in front of his children and contact child protective services (CPS) about CheddarMane's alleged drug use if he did not provide Cantwell with information on the identity of \\"Vic Mackey\\", another pseudonymous Bowl Patrol member. According to prosecutors, Cantwell followed through with the threat to contact CPS. In September 2019, Cantwell met with the FBI thinking he was helping form a case against the Bowl Patrol members. However, the FBI were actually forming a case to prosecute Cantwell for his June threats. On January 23, 2020, Cantwell was arrested by the FBI and charged with extortion over interstate communications and making threatening interstate communications in relation to the threats made against CheddarMane. Court filings also alleged that several days before his arrest, Cantwell used Telegram to threaten an attorney working on a lawsuit against him and others involved with the Unite the Right rally. During Cantwell's arrest, officers recovered seventeen firearms and other weapons from his residence and vehicle. Cantwell remained in jail from the time of his January arrest until trial, after the judge sided with prosecutors who argued that he was a risk to public safety. He was set to go to trial in March 2020, but the trial date was postponed to September 15, 2020. On July 8, Cantwell was indicted on additional charges of cyberstalking and threatening to injure property or reputation. The federal trial began on September 22, 2020, and on September 28, 2020, Cantwell was found guilty on one count of transmitting extortionate communications and one count of threatening to injure property or reputation, and found not guilty of the cyberstalking charge. Scheduled to be sentenced on January 4, 2021, Cantwell faces a maximum sentence of 22 years in prison.  Broadcasting and writing  Cantwell writes essays on his personal blog about topics including white supremacy, alt-right politics, libertarianism, and the men's rights movement. He has written for and republished essays about the men's rights movement to A Voice for Men, a men's rights and antifeminist website. In 2013 and 2014, he wrote and republished his anti-police essays as a volunteer for Cop Block, a police accountability organization. Cantwell co-hosted the anarcho-capitalist radio show Free Talk Live but was suspended in 2015 after tweeting a racial slur against an African American person who criticized him. He later was removed from the position permanently. Meanwhile, in December 2013, Cantwell began what he originally called Some Garbage Podcast, disseminated through YouTube and elsewhere, and in April 2015 renamed it Radical Agenda, subtitled \\"a show about common sense extremism\\". By calling compatriots who recorded the conversations and posted them on his blog, Cantwell continued to broadcast from jail while he was incarcerated in August‚ÄìDecember 2017 on charges related to the Unite the Right rally. In January 2019, Cantwell created a more toned-down version of Radical Agenda called Outlaw Conservative. On April 9, 2019, Cantwell published a blog post announcing that he had been \\"neglecting to deal with some serious personal problems for a very long time\\", and that he needed to \\"stop, avoid recording devices, and pull [himself] together.\\" Cantwell told the Southern Poverty Law Center that he had decided to step away from broadcasting because \\"'Jews' had taken an emotional toll on him\\" and that he needed to \\"[step] away from the microphone to avoid another 'Crying Nazi' moment\\". Cantwell returned to broadcasting and writing by June of the same year. = Social media suspensions = On August 16, 2017, Facebook said it had shut down Cantwell's Facebook and Instagram profiles due to statements he made in connection with the Unite the Right rally. The following day it was reported that Cantwell had been banned from online dating service OKCupid after a woman reported receiving a message from him after seeing him in the Vice News Tonight segment. In a blog post published on August 17, 2017, Cantwell wrote, \\"I have been shut out of nearly every financial and communications system I once had available. PayPal, Venmo, Dwolla, and Stripe all disabled my accounts. I was shut out not only of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and MailChimp, but now even my online dating profiles at OKCupid, Match.com, and Tinder have all been disabled.\\" On March 18, 2019, the far-right social network Gab tweeted a statement that they had indefinitely banned an unnamed \\"controversial user\\" for making two \\"inflammatory political posts\\". Cantwell posted on his blog that he believes he was the one who was banned, after he discovered his profile had been blanked and he was unable to log in, and it was later confirmed the banned user was Cantwell. A December 2017 episode of the Radical Agenda podcast featured a conversation between Cantwell and Andrew \\"weev\\" Auernheimer, a white supremacist, Internet troll, and the webmaster of The Daily Stormer. In the episode, Auernheimer called for the mass murder of Jewish children. Shortly after, GoDaddy announced that they would no longer host the Radical Agenda website after finding it in violation of their policies against encouraging and promoting violence. Cantwell wrote of the difficulties he was facing due to his suspensions in a private Telegram group, saying, \\"My inability to grow [Radical Agenda] by being on other platforms, my inability to make money, is threatening to bankrupt me and end the show\\".

He was often associated with St. Thomas' pirate-friendly Governor Adolph Esmit. History Hamlin began his career in 1682, sailing from Jamaica in a small sloop loaded with 120 men, with which he took the frigate La Trompeuse (The Trickster), which itself had changed hands between a number of pirates. He quickly looted eighteen Jamaican ships, causing Jamaica's Governor Thomas Lynch to send two ships after him. The first missed him; the second, HMS Guernsey, found Hamlin but was outpaced by the freshly careened Trompeuse, which \\"sailed three feet to his one.\\" Lynch recruited retired pirate turned pirate-hunter John Coxon to bring in Hamlin; Coxon was unsuccessful, so Lynch tried hiring buccaneer Jan \\"Yankey\\" Willems, who refused even to look for Hamlin. With so much pressure on his operations, Hamlin left his hideout at √éle-√†-Vache and sailed to St. Thomas where he was sheltered by Danish Governor Adolph Esmit. Early in 1683 he began attacking English ships near Hispaniola (letting a French ship go free), returning to St. Thomas where Esmit helped him sell off his plunder. He sailed for Sierra Leone off the African coast in May, capturing seventeen Dutch and English vessels. Some of his crew split off under a Captain Morgan, taking a prize ship with them; Hamlin returned to St. Thomas. Hamlin had reportedly been very cruel to the crews of captured ships, leading Nevis' Governor William Stapleton to call him \\"John Hamlin, the arch murderer and torturer.\\" The English found him there in late 1683 and HMS Francis attacked. They were fired on not only by the 32-gun Trompeuse but by the Danish fort, which infuriated the English. Finally the English captured and burned Trompeuse, which exploded and set fire to another vessel left in the harbor. Hamlin escaped and Esmit protected him at Charlotte Amalie yet again. Hamlin formed a new crew late in 1684 for his ship La Nouvelle Trompeuse (The New Tricketer), which had been fitted out in New England. Esmit was removed from his post by exasperated Danish officials in October 1684, so Hamlin left for his old refuge at √éle-√†-Vache, and then to Brazil. There are few records of his subsequent activities, though almost fifty of his former crew signed aboard the ships of buccaneer Jacob Evertson and privateer Jan Willems, who had previously refused to hunt down Hamlin. After Willems and Evertson died in early 1688, their remaining crew (some of them formerly Hamlin's) sailed with Captain Peterson. The original Trompeuse which burned at St. Thomas was reportedly found by divers in 1990 but its authenticity is disputed. Legends persist that Hamlin's loot ‚Äì \\"treasure room was full of silver ‚Ä¶ over 24,000 pounds there\\" ‚Äì is still aboard. In popular culture The TV show Caribbean Pirate Treasure Season 1 Episode 7 aired on 20 August 2017.

He is an experimental cognitive scientist specializing in stereotyping, prejudice, and learning. His work explores the cultural and cognitive mechanisms that perpetuate stereotypes and prejudices and applies the understanding of those mechanisms to effective evidence-based interventions to reduce bias. Cox and Devine have conducted research on the cognitive structure of stereotypes, demonstrating that some stereotypes primarily serve as categorization cues, especially those stereotypes related to social groups with non-visible defining features, like gay men. Whereas other researchers have argued that people have an accurate \\"gaydar\\" ability that enables people to visually identify whether someone is gay or straight, Cox, Devine, and their colleagues argued that \\"gaydar\\" is simply an alternate label for using stereotypes to infer orientation (e.g., inferring that fashionable men are gay), and thereby serves the function of a legitimizing myth to reduce the normative stigma associated with stereotyping. The researchers point out that past work arguing that people have accurate \\"gaydar\\" falls prey to the false positive paradox (see also the base rate fallacy), because the alleged accuracy discounts the very low base rate of LGB people in real populations, resulting in a scenario where the \\"accuracy\\" of gaydar reported in lab studies translates to high levels of inaccuracy in the real world.

It has narrow clover-like leaves, and cream-coloured, frilly flowers with a yellowish centre, looking a bit like a small butterfly or a set of elk antlers. It naturally occurs in dry and sandy habitats in Texas and adjacent parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.  Taxonomy  The American botanist Thomas Nuttall was the first to describe large clammyweed in 1834, which he placed in a new genus and named Cristatella erosa. Amos Eaton included the species in 1836 in the genus Cleome as C. erosa. In 1842, Stephan Endlicher, an Austrian botanist who was the director of the Vienna Botanical Garden moved the species to a new genus and renamed it to Cyrbasium erosum, which is an illegitimate name. In 1958 Hugh Iltis concluded the species could better be assigned to the genus Polanisia, a name that has priority over Cristatella, since it was already erected by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1819, and made the new combination P. erosa. Iltis distinguished two subtaxa, the nominate and subspecies breviglandulosa.  Description  Large clammyweed is a sticky, unscented annual herb of . It has branched or unbranched, green or purple stems with seated glands and glandular hairs. The long, green or purple leaf stalks are often at an angle with the leaf blade. The leaf blade consists of three narrow, long and only wide, somewhat fleshy leaflets, the right and left halves more or less folded towards each other (or conduplicate) with entire margins, a needle-like tip, the underside of the leaf with many, and the upper side with few glands. The bilaterally symmetrical flowers are set in gland-covered racemes that are initially long but that keep growing to when fruits are ripe. Each individual flower is subtended by a bracts consisting of one or three entire bractlets, which have an oval shape and are long. The stalk of the individual flower is 1‚àí2‚Öì cm (0.4-0.9 in) long. The four deciduous, eventually deflected, green to purple coloured, hairless sepals are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped, 2¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω mm (0.1‚Äì0.14 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬º mm (0.03‚Äì0.05 in) wide, with entire margins and a pointy tip. The four petals are mostly creamy white, oblong-ovate, consist of a more yellowish straight and narrow claw and a wide plate. The forward directed lower (abaxial) pair is long and 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.10-0.12 in) wide the upper ‚Öî deeply incised to create nine or ten finger-like lobes, often themselves ones or even twice split into two lobes (also described as a lacerate margin). The upper (adaxial) pair is long and 3¬Ω‚Äì5 mm (0.12-0.20 in) wide, less deeply incised with four to six finger-like lobes. The tube-shaped nectaries are yellow, but become purple when drying and are 1-5¬Ω mm (0.02‚Äì0.12 in) long. There are six to fifteen stamens that reach beyond the petals, consist of purple 1‚Äì1‚Öì cm (0.4-0.5 in) filaments topped by purple, 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) long anthers, which do not coil when the pollen is released. The long ovary sits on the end of a gynophore that grows to a length of when the fruit is ripe, and is topped with a 2¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω mm (0.10‚Äì0.18 in) long style that persists and ends in a green stigma. The fruit is a capsule of long and ¬º‚Äì¬Ω cm (0.1-0.2 in) in diameter, with a netted surface with or without some glandular hairs. Each capsule contains twelve to forty, globular to ovate, dark reddish brown seeds of 1¬Ω‚Äì1¬æ mm (0.06‚Äì0.07 in), with a nobbly surface. = Subspecies = Polanisia erosa subsp. erosa that grows in eastern Texas and adjacent Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma has about long nectaries, a gynophore when the fruit is ripe, and the largest petals are . In Polanisia erosa subsp. breviglandulosa from southernmost Texas however, those measuments are 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) for the nectaries, for the gynophore and for the petals.  Distribution and habitat  Large clammyweed naturally occurs in Texas and adjacent parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, where it can be found in fields, prairies, sandy hillsides and open woodland.

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and Suret√© du Qu√©bec's art theft unit. Security camera footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works. In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an Edmonton man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for CDN$1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a CBC interview unrelated to the case. The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016. Charges laid against Metke were disposed with a conditional discharge after he pled guilty to possession of stolen property. Metke's story inspired a character in Kevin Smith's 2016 film Yoga Hosers, as well as the film's title. The relief itself was later found to have been taken from Iran illegally, and returned there after being seized from a dealer's wares during a New York art fair. Thefts On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a sandstone relief depicting a soldier's head, produced during the Achaemenid Empire, which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE; it had been donated to the museum in the 1950s by Frederick Cleveland Morgan, heir to a department store fortune, art collector and philanthropist. It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history. The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st- century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case. Investigation When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent collection, missing, the museum called the Suret√© du Qu√©bec's (SQ) art theft unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and AXA, its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing security camera footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the museum. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area. alt=An almost cubical modernist building several stories high faced in smooth stone, with a recessed entrance on the ground level and circular windows above, seen at an angle from across the street. A large poster in front advertises a pop-art exhibit The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items. It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000. John Fossey, an archaeologist, told CTV later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were \\"small [and] easy to put in the bag.\\" Another expert involved, art- theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. \\"[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them\\", he told The Globe and Mail. He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately. =Sale of relief= Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a yoga teacher from Edmonton, travelled to Montreal for a visit. A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture. alt=A stone panel with the head of a bearded man seen in profile, the top of his shield, and an upright spear tip on the left When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid relief that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it. The seller's asking price was CDN$1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. \\"This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent,\\" Metke recalled later. \\"He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more.\\" Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a Google search on \\"Are there any Mesopotamian artifacts missing?\\" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with 2012, the last year in the Mayan Calendar, a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork. \\"It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me.\\" He thought \\"it would have been kind of fun\\" to take it to an Antiques Roadshow production, or go to the Middle East himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a meditation area he had set up in his living room. Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of Star Wars action figures, crystals and stuffed animals. A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a CBC News crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots. Recovery of relief and arrests The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a warrant to search Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. \\"The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows,\\" recalled Metke. A team of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) from both Alberta and Quebec, along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. \\"I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either,\\" he said of the seller. He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. \\"[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost.\\" At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief. However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown. Police charged Metke with possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value, possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well. Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. \\"It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet,\\" he said later. The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid. The board said it would meet to consider the possibility. It decided not to, and in 2016 it was offered for sale at the Frieze Art Fair for ¬£2.2 million. =Return of relief to Iran= The relief was eventually purchased by British antiquities dealer Rupert Wace. He, in turn, offered it for sale at The European Fine Art Fair in New York's Park Avenue Armory in October 2017, until it was seized by prosecutors from the New York County District Attorney's office. The Iranian government claimed it had been taken from the ruins of Persepolis without permission in the 1930s, later than dealers assumed, after the government had passed a law severely restricting removals of antiquities from the country. A court soon ordered its return to Iran. Trial The Crown later stayed two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself of its provenance. In return the judge gave him a conditional discharge with probation and community service. Both sides described the case as \\"unique\\" and \\"extraordinary\\". Yoga Hosers At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker Kevin Smith discussed the story on his podcast, SModcast, amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co- host, Scott Mosier, imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying \\"Open up, yoga hoser!\\" The last two words became a minor catchphrase among their fans. In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called Yoga Hosers. He completed the film in time for the January 2016 Sundance Film Festival. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a yoga instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. Justin Long, who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.

The tour marks Twain's first since 2015's Rock This Country Tour, which, at the time, Twain announced would be her final run out on the road.  Background  During an interview with ET Canada, on June 29, 2017, Twain stated that she had a change of heart and was ready to hit the road again to support her upcoming album, Now, stating \\"Now that I've got new music, I'm really motivated to do that music live\\".

The following day on August 17, 2017, Twain confirmed that she will be going on tour to support her upcoming album Now, through social media with tickets going on sale the following week. Following on from various promotional appearances for Now in the UK, including an exclusive set at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park, Twain announced the UK/Ireland dates on September 20, 2017. Revealing her excitement over her tour news, Shania said, \\"It's time to get back out there and give the music a chance to live a life!\\" Tickets for shows in Dublin and Belfast sold out within minutes, prompting Twain to add a second Dublin show. Additional dates for both Glasgow and London were announced after tickets for the initial dates quickly sold out. Due to demand, extra dates were added for Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland. An additional concert for New Zealand was added for December 22 in Dunedin after the first two in Auckland sold out. On February 26, 2018, she was announced as headliner for the Festa do Pe√£o de Barretos, her first concert in Brazil. Negotiations for this to happen took over 20 years and Twain was paid over 1.1 million to perform for 100.000 fans who came from multiple countries of South America. At the end of 2018, the tour placed at number 34 on Pollstar's \\"2018 Year-End Top 100 Worldwide Tours\\" list, estimating that it grossed $51.5 million and that 596,972 people attended throughout the year.https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2018/12/2018YearEndTop100WorldwideTours_697.pdf In July 2019, Pollstar ranked the tour on number 69 at the Mid Year Top 100 Worldwide Tours 2019 with $8.5 million and 74,533 of tickets sold in 7 shows.https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2019/07/2019MidYearTop100WorldwideTours_747.pdf Overall according to Pollstar, the tour grossed $60 million in 59 dates for a total attendance of 671,505 people in an average of 11,381 fans per concert paying $100.40 dollars for each ticket. According to Touring Data, which combines published and non-published boxscores in Pollstar and Billboard magazine, the tour had an estimated gross of $76 million in 76 dates and 860,000 tickets sold worldwide. The tour is the best-selling tour for a country female artist in 2018 and the seventh best-selling for a female artist overall in the same year. The Now Tour helped secure Twain's place as the second highest-grossing country female artist in the decade with over $190 million collected, only behind Taylor Swift.  Critical reception  The tour opened to positive critical reception. Fish Griwkowsky of the Edmonton Journal called the tour Twain's best, while Matt Olsen of the StarPhoenix complimented the show saying it was \\"filled with extravagance and punctuated with genuine emotion\\". Opening acts On April 11, 2018, Swiss singer Bastian Baker confirmed he would be the opening act for all of the tour's 77 dates. Baker previously opened for Twain on the final two dates of her 2015 Rock This Country Tour.

Last look is a trading practice where the liquidity provider (LP) provides a quote rather than a firm price into the trading system or execution venue. These venues are often used in retail foreign exchange trading. When a request to trade against the quoted price is received, the LP may hold the request for some time, execute the trade (fill) at the price quoted, offer an alternative price (requote) or decline to trade (reject). Firm liquidity venues on the other hand operate an open central limit order book where trades are matched without optionality. Last look's quote-driven behaviour is commonly argued to be necessary to protect the liquidity providers in a fragmented and unregulated market place where there is no central exchange. The last look model has been the subject of several recent investigations and fines for misconduct over abuses of the practice and lack of transparency. Regulators are showing increased interest in the provision of last look liquidity in the FX market, with the Bank of England conducting a 'Fair and Effective Markets Review' (FEMR) which included recommendations for the FX industry. In response, the FX industry has moved towards adopting a global code of conduct. However surveys indicate that many FX market participants do not believe that the situation has improved in the last two years. Both industry comment and the FEMR review final reporthttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Documents/femrjun15.pdf describe the use of transaction cost analysis (TCA) as a method by which buy side traders can assess quality of execution from all liquidity providers and determine if they are at a disadvantage from last look.

Since 2006 he has been professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Education at the Ludwigsburg University of Education, after two years as a Professor of Mathematical Education at Leibniz University Hannover (2004‚Äì2006). Before becoming a professor he worked as a research fellow at the University of Heidelberg in Applied Mathematics and the University of Bonn in Economics and was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  Training  Engel obtained a German Diploma in Mathematics in 1977 and teaching credentials as a high school teacher (Mathematics and Theology) at the University of Bonn. After his graduation he joined Eirene ‚Äì International Christian Service for PeaceInternationaler Christlicher Friedensdienst and worked as volunteer with troubled teenagers in Ohio and with a community serving the homeless in Los Angeles. Back to academic life, he obtained a master's degree at the University of Southern California in 1986 and his PhD in Applied Mathematics in 1988. He then worked in the US and Germany as a research fellow and obtained his German Habilitation in Mathematics Education from Ludwigsburg University in 1998.

She also visited Kurdistan Region in 1991, visiting refugees at the Iran-Iraq border, and again in July 1992 to witness the establishment of the Kurdistan Region Parliament. In 2011, Jonathan Randal wrote that: \\"In France, Danielle Mitterrand, the former President‚Äôs wife and vociferous defender of the Kurds and other downtrodden minorities, needed no encouragement to bring their plight to her husband‚Äôs attention. When in late March 1991 the Iraqi counteroffensive gathered steam, she alerted specialists inside and outside the government to prepare contingency plans. She had been sensitized to the Kurds by, among others, Bernard Dorin, a diplomat who abruptly gave up his career to work for the Kurds without knowing much about them.\\" =Chirac (1995‚Äì2012)= In an interview with L'essentiel in 2012, Kurdish President Massoud Barzani stated that Kurdistan Region had no direct relations with President Chirac, but had contacts to several ministers including Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy. =Sarkozy (2007‚Äì2012)= Under the presidency of Sarkozy, a French embassy office was opened in Erbil with the presence of French Foreign Minister Kouschner. In 2010, Kouschner described Sarkozy's approachment to the Kurds as being a revitalizing of their relations. In the same year, Massoud Barzani met with President Nicolas Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in Paris, where they signed a protocol strengthening ties in various fields, including trade, education and culture. Sarkozy commented at the relations and stated that: \\"France is happy with its friendship with Kurdistan and attaches great importance to this friendship.\\" =Hollande (2012‚Äì2017)= Kurdish President Massoud Barzani has met with French President Fran√ßois Hollande in Paris on three occasions; in 2014, 2015 and in 2016, while Hollande visited Erbil in 2014 and 2017. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian met Kurdish officials twice in 2016, once at the Munich Security Conference and once in Erbil. Military aid In August 2014, France sent soldiers to Kurdistan Region to train Kurdish soldiers (Peshmerga). In January 2015, 40 more soldiers were sent to the region. In August 2014, France also supplied Kurdish soldiers with an undisclosed amount of weapons and 20 tons of humanitarian aid. In early February 2015, a Kurdish military delegation led by Minister of Peshmerga Sayid Qadir met with Hollande to discuss military cooperation. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made an unannounced visit to Erbil in April 2016, where he stated that: \\"I also came here to meet with the Kurdistan Region President Masoud Barzani and Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani to reiterate the support of France to Peshmerga forces in the fight against Da‚Äôesh,‚Äù and furthermore that: ‚ÄúThe Peshmerga plays an important role in this fight.\\" In June 2016, two shipments of military aid reached Kurdistan Region consisting of MM89 rockets, thousands of different types of ammunition, defense and attacking grenades and night- vision goggles.

The game was released for Windows-based personal computers in August 2017, and for iOS devices in October 2017. It was released on the Nintendo Switch in March 2018. Gameplay Subsurface Circular is a loose take on text-based adventure games, with the game presented in a three- dimensional, third-person perspective. The player controls a robot detective in a futuristic setting, tasked with solving cases aboard a subway system below a human city that ferries around other robots that serve as the workforce. In the game, the robot detective must solve a case of a number of robots that have gone missing, by talking to other robots while they are on the subway cars, following various conversation trees, and at times, solving puzzles to help out a robot and get more information. The player acquires \\"focal points\\" on achieving certain goals, which then can be used to question other robots to get more information to solve the mystery. Plot While the player can select from several names for the playable character, this summary assumes the use of \\"Theta One One\\" for purposes of clarity. Theta One One, the playable character, is an android-like Tek, assigned as a detective for other Teks on a subway system and serving his human masters, known as \\"management\\". During one night, one Tek, a fabricator, tells Theta One One of another Tek that had gone missing, and Theta One One decides to take the case. As the subway train circles the city, Theta One One talks to other Tek passengers, learning of a mysterious Red Tek that may be connected to the mystery, that a number of other Teks may have gone missing, and that there is growing resent to Teks by the human population in the city above. Eventually, Theta One One is able to upload the case details to management, upon which they inform the Tek that since it took the case without their instructions, the Tek will be apprehended. At the next station, two detective Teks arrive, preparing to deal with Theta One One, but the Tek is able to manipulate the pair to learn that over hundreds of Teks have gone missing over the last several months, and to management, they saw this as a rounding error in Tek production. Management did not want this known, and thus it seems to others that Teks have simply gone missing. The detective Teks use an override access code to reset Theta One One to an unassigned position and leave the Tek to get off later on the subway ride to take itself to fabrication and be reassigned. Theta One One is still experiencing the sense of loss when at the next stop it meets an infantry Tek who seeks to confess its sins. Theta One One manages to coax this out of the Tek, and learns that it was part of the plan to overproduce infantry Teks that have been amassing outside of the city above, preparing to attack it; this is the source of management's rounding error. At the next stop, the same fabricator that Theta One One first talked to that night comes aboard, and reveals it was the Red Tek others spoke of, and is leading this plan. It planned to use the infantry Teks to kill management and have Teks take over which could run the city more efficiently; this would help the humans working low-level jobs to be able to pursue more constructive options while Teks replace their roles. Otherwise, without this change, the system will continue on the status quo, with management using Teks to replace humans, and hurting many humans in the process. Red Tek needed Theta One One to investigate as it did as to scout the current situation in the city from the Tek's perspective, providing its high-level intelligence to analyze the situation. At this point, Red Tek offers Theta One One a weapon and tells it that a choice to kill Red Tek or itself must be made; by killing Red Tek, Theta One One will be able to report to management about the infantry Teks and give them time to stop it, as to let the status quo remain; by killing itself, Theta One One would allow the Tek overthrow to proceed. The game ends after the player makes either choice. Development and release Designer Mike Bithell in 2013 Subsurface Circular was developed by British video game designer and developer Mike Bithell along with a small team. Bithell had been pitching another game idea during the March 2017 Game Developers Conference. He recognised that negotiations for launching development of this game would take several months, and wanted to keep busy during this time, thus starting development of Subsurface Circular shortly after his return. Bithell was inspired by old text adventure games such as those he programmed as a youth on the BBC Micro, and decided to try creating a modern take on the genre with a short and focused narrative. He also wanted to explore the ideas of how robots will eventually replace humans as the primary workforce in the future, and how ethical and political issues around a sentient robotic workforce would be seen, comparing the situation to historical and modern-day insurgencies. The game was announced and released for Windows-based personal computers via Steam on 17 August 2017. Bithell considers this as a first of his \\"Bithell Shorts\\", games that are short and inexpensive that allow him to experiment with narrative approaches, while he continued to work on his next major release. Bithell planned this as a short game, one that would \\"respect [ones] time\\" to be completed within a single play session and not linger and remain unfinished as many AAA titles he felt can be. As he knew the game was short, he did not want to create great expectations for players, and opted to announce and release the game on the same day. Though Bithell had been concerned that the game's short length fell within the time period that would automatically grant a refund to players that requested it, he found that after about a month, only 2% of those that purchased the game had sought a refund. Bithell considered this validation of the short-game model approach, though commented that his case may be exceptional since he is an established and recognized developer. Bithell said he was able to recoup production costs within three weeks of the game going live. A port for iOS devices was released on 23 October 2017. A version for the Nintendo Switch was announced on 15 February 2018, and released on 1 March 2018; this version utilizes the Switch's gyroscopic sensors so that the player can look around the environment by tilting the console. In May 2018, Bithell released a followup game titled Quarantine Circular. Reception Subsurface Circular was well received by professional critics. Praise was directed towards the game's engaging storytelling and writing. Polygon reviewer Colin Campbell welcomed Bithell's idea of creating a series of short, experimental and narrative-driven games. Campbell complimented Subsurface Circulars \\"rich narrative landscape\\" presented through its dialogue and characters. The game was nominated for \\"Writing or Narrative Design\\" at the 2018 Develop Awards.

Master's certificate Location Litochoro is located on the eastern side of Mount Olympus in Greece, 5 km from the sea and at an altitude of about 350 m. The museum is located in the municipal administration building. History Until far into the 20th century, Litochoro was home to many shipowners and sailors. When the steamships displaced the sail ships, this era ended. In 1995 the members of the Association of the Retired Sailors of Litochoro were given the idea of documenting the legacy of maritime navigation and saving and preserving the cultural, maritime heritage of the place. Between 1995 and 2002 maritime relics were collected within the (formerly) maritime families of the village. From 2002 to 2004 the exhibition pieces were gathered and brought together. The \\"Nautical Museum of Litochoro\\", founded in 2004, is registered in the Greek Ministry of Culture as an \\"institution of cultural maritime heritage\\". Since its inception, the scope of the shown exhibits has been constantly expanded. The museum Commemorative plaque in the Nautical Museum The exhibits are either collected from the households of the former seafarers or were donated by shipowners or the navy. In front of the building are anchors, buoys, ships propellers and a torpedo. Although the museum is dedicated to merchant shipping, the tour begins with a model of a torpedo boat, which, in 1912, sank a Turkish warship in front of the port of Thessaloniki. Old pictures, some almost 100 years old, show proud families in the shipyard who supervise the construction of their ship. Other pictures show sailors on board or in port. In several showcases are impressive ship models. Many of these are original replicas of ships that were once home here. Others represent a cross-section of traditional Greek ships over the centuries. This is followed by nautical devices such as compasses, chronometers and sextants. Although displaced by modern technology such as GPS, these devices are still mandatory on board. If they fail or do not work correctly, threaten penalties. Furthermore, nautical charts and logarithm tables are needed to determine the exact position of the ship. The men who have not returned from the sea are devoted to a memorial plaque. It is noticeable that sometimes whole families fell victim to Poseidon's whims. The exhibitions In the months of July and August separate exhibitions take place. The themes and the shown exhibits change every year. In 2016 ship models of the model builder Dimitris Maras were shown. In 2017, an exhibition will be held on the history of officer training in Greece.

Established by the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association \\"for the intensive investigation of observation cases and for the treatment by modern methods of chronic and advanced pulmonary disease\\", it was built between 1932 and 1936 and officially opened by Prince George, Duke of Kent as a specialist tuberculosis facility in 1936.

However, during the Second World War it began to admit non-TB patients, and it afterwards served as a general chest and heart treatment facility. During the war, it had general surgery wards and its own maternity unit. In 1943 there was a Battalion of American Seabees, the US Construction Corps, living on a merchant vessel tied up in Penarth docks, while they built a large number of Quonset huts for a rapid temporary expansions of Sully Hospital needed for the extra wartime pressure of additional patients, both military and civilian. Many of the Quonset huts remained in use as overflow accommodation until the mid-1960s. In 1993 the hospital switched to a speciality in residential psychiatric care until its final closure as a hospital in 2001. While standing vacant the hospital building was briefly considered as a potential location for the temporary housing of up to 750 Eastern European asylum seekers, but those plans were eventually shelved after a campaign and objections by local residents. In the early 21st century the building was converted into individual luxury apartments by the investment property company Galliard Homes.

It was translated into English in A Rebirth: Poems, translated by David Martin, with a critical essay by Farzaneh Milani (Mazda Publishers, Lexington Ky., 1985) .  Analysis  Farrokhzad's poems express the environment in which she lived. ‚ÄúThe Wind-Up Doll,‚Äù written in the time of the Pahlavi kings, conveys the psychological frustrations of women in a restrictive time where women were treated like objects and are suppressed. At the end of the poem, the speaker sarcastically says, ‚ÄúAh, so happy am I!‚Äù At that time, the monarch determined the conditions for women. For example, once he ordered prohibiting the use of the chador by women in public in 1935 even though society still had traditional views regarding women. In the poem \\"The Wind Up Doll\\", Farrokhzad challenges the restrictive role of Iranian women and presents the thoughts and emotions of women seeking greater respect and rights.  About the author Farrokhzad was one of the most influential Persian poets and is still the voice of women in Iran. She began composing poetry when she was 13 or 14. She married a man who was much older than her when she was 16 and divorced her husband soon after. Many of her poems focused on feminism and have remained important and significant long after. Farrokhzad's obsession with society made her protest against the existing standards of living and that is why her poems have been banned since revolution of Iran in 1979. She was one of the first female poets who protested against inequality between genders and broke taboos in Iran. She died tragically in a car accident when she was only 32.

Fannie Gerry Wilder, A woman of the century Sarah Frances \\"Fannie\\" Gerry Wilder (September 4, 1850 - April 26, 1923) was an American author. Early life and education Sarah Frances Gerry was born in Standish, Maine, on September 4, 1850. She was the daughter of Rev. Edwin Jerome Gerry (1820-1885) and Sophia J. Goodwin (1827 - 1898). Her father was settled over the Unitarian parish in that town seven years, then going to New York, where he was connected with the Children's Aid Society for five years, and finally accepted a rail from the Benevolent Fraternity of Churches to settle in Boston as pastor of the Hanover Street Chapel, where he remained as minister for twenty- five years. Gerry, although born in Maine, was essentially a Bostonian, as she was educated in the schools of that city and lived in the vicinity nearly all her life. Career As S. Fannie Gerry grew to womanhood, her interest became naturally identified with her father's work, in assisting the poorer class among whom he labored. She was looked upon by the people of his parish as a sister, friend and helper. She was very fond of history and literature in her school-days, taking a high rank in composition during that time. After the death of her father, her desire became so great to place his work and life before the public, that it might serve to inspire others, that she wrote, in 1887, his memoir, entitled The Story of a Useful Life: Edwin J. Gerry. 1820-1885. Afterward she wrote for different papers and magazines, making a specialty of stories for children. Her love for the work increased every year, and in 1890 she published a book for young people, entitled Boston Girls at Home and Abroad. She then published another book for young people, historical in character, entitled Looking Westward: A Romance of 1620. She was an active member of the New England Woman's Press Association, and was connected with various other societies. She was elected secretary of the Arlington, Massachusetts, branch of the Chautauqua Literary Social Circle for 1892. Personal life On June 16, 1881 Sarah F. Gerry married Millard F. Wilder, a young business man of Arlington. They had one son, Edwin Gerry Wilder (February 29, 1884 - March 22, 1884), who died an infant. She died on April 26, 1923, and is buried with her son and parents at Evergreen Cemetery, Leominster.

Sigrid Hedman was married to the wholesaler Ernst Hedman (1853‚Äì1938). They had five children, born 1884‚Äì1889. Sigrid Hedman had been an early member of the Edelweiss Society in Stockholm. She was interested in spiritualism, and had mediumistic gifts. In 1900 she published an article in the magazine \\"Efter√•t? Tidskrift f√∂r spiritism och d√§rmed besl√§gtade √§mnen\\" [Afterwards? Journal of Spiritualism and related topics], which was the main publication for spiritualism in Sweden. In the article she defended spiritualism, pointing out how straining it was for the medium to get in touch with higher beings. The other members the group De Fem (The Five) were Hilma af Klint, Anna Cassel, Mathilda Nilsson and Cornelia Cederberg (Mathilda Nilsson's sister). It began as an ordinary spiritualist group that received messages through a psychograph (an instrument for recording spirit writings) or a trance medium. Sigrid Hedman was the medium within the group, as she was the one receiving the messages from the spirits. During group's s√©ances spirit leaders presented themselves by name and promised to help the group's members in their spiritual training. The spirits communicating with the five women were mostly Gregor, Georg, Clemens, Ananda och Amaliel. Such leaders are common in spiritualist literature and life. Through itheir spiritural guidance, the group was inspired to draw automatically in pencil, a technique that was not unusual at that time. When the hand moved automatically, the conscious will did not direct the pattern that developed on the paper, and, in theory, the women thus became artistic tools for their spirit leaders. This technique, called automatism was used a decade later by the Surrealists. In a series of sketchbooks, religious scenes and symbols were depicted in drawings made by the group collectively. Their drawing technique developed in such a way that abstract patterns‚Äîdependent on the free movement of the hand‚Äîbecame visible.\\"Revolt, They Said\\". www.andreageyer.info.

This transit service offers flexible routing and/or flexible scheduling of minibus vehicles. Microtransit providers build routes so as to match demand (trip) and supply (driven vehicle) and extend the efficiency and accessibility of the transit service. Possible pick-up/drop-off stops are restricted (usually within a geofenced area), and transit can be provided either as a stop-to-stop service or curb-to-curb service. Conceptually, microtransit fits somewhere between private individual transportation (cars or taxicabs or TNCs) and public mass transit (bus). Although this kind of transit service has been running for a while in Southern hemisphere countries and Asia, the development of technologies has led to a wave of pilots and adoption in Europe and North America. Technologies allow real time exchange of information and programmed optimization of the transit service. The term Microtransit may have emerged into widespread industry discussion around 2015, when this wave of technology enabled services was starting, and seems specific to the English language. The current implementations result from public-private partnerships (and subsidized by the government) or are brought by the private sector directly to the customer. It is unsure if microtransit can be profitable (just like public transit). Success of microtransit systems depends on its configuration. Some experiences in the US resulted in failures. Application  The flexibility and intelligence in microtransit can be useful in cases when the demand is either geographically spread or coming at various and/or unpredictable times, i.e. when it is hard to gather demand with a planned transit service. Examples include: low-density areas, night services, and other formats adapted to specific needs.  References   External links  * Stromberg, J.

One critic said they conveyed a mood that was \\"ethereal, bold and engaged.\\" Another said her work showed \\"a disciplined hand and a romantic eye\\" together with \\"a magical color sense.\\" Known for her control of detail and successful handling of line and blocks of color, she was said to paint in a modernist style that stayed clear of abstraction and was remembered by a teacher and fellow artist as \\"the finest woman painter in Philadelphia during the 20s and 30s.\\" Early life and training Born in Philadelphia, Gemberling grew up in that city and at a farm her family owned in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. She developed an interest in art while a student at Friends' Central School. With the encouragement of her parents, she enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1920 and for the next three years she studied under Daniel Garber, Hugh Breckenridge, and Arthur Carles. Showing great promise as a student, she received the valuable Cresson Traveling Scholarship in both 1923 and 1924. Career Gemberling's career as a professional artist began after she returned from European travel in 1924 and decided not to continue attending classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. When in 1926 she exhibited with the Philadelphia Water Color Club, a reviewer said her painting, \\"Marine\\" was \\"gorgeous,\\" and later that year when she exhibited at the Plastic Club, the same reviewer praised a portrait of hers, \\"Anna Ruth,\\" as \\"nicely spontaneous.\\" Thereafter, her paintings appeared frequently in Philadelphia exhibitions and quite often received favorable notice. From 1930 onwards, she showed in other East Coast locations including the Corcoran Biennials of 1930 and 1935 in Washington, D.C.; the Salons of America and National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors exhibitions of 1932 in New York; and exhibitions held by the North Shore Art Association of Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1932 and 1933. =Artistic style= During the course of her career critics frequently noticed Gemberling's competent handling of color and her skill in design and execution. Grace Gemberling, \\"Professor Otakar Sevcik,\\" about 1926, height: 13.3 inches, width: 10.625 inches. Critics singled out specific paintings for discussion. Regarding \\"Otakar Sevcik\\" C. H. Bonte of the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: \\"Her so called 'sketch' of Professor Otakar Sevcik (1852-1936) is a creation of so much life, charm and dignity of coloring as to constitute a finished portrait.\\" Of her \\"Amusement Park\\" Edward Alden Jewell of the New York Times wrote: \\"Grace Thorp Gemberling's \\"Amusement Park\\" young ladies look quite as indisposed as ever. Those who pin their admiration exclusively to subject will doubtless turn away from protagonists so depressing, but the judicious can hardly fail to admire this painter's astuteness in constructing a picture.\\" Grace Gemberling, Untitled (landscape), undated, oil on canvas, height: 28 inches, width: 35 inches In reviewing an untitled landscape Scott Chalfont wrote in an exhibition catalog: \\"So characteristic of Gemberling's finest talent, in this landscape she takes a scene and makes it her own. From the wispy trees, to the dark skies and vibrant houses, the contrasts create a compelling painting.\\" In 1938 a critic wrote: > As personal as are the creations of Grace Gemberling, there is extraordinary > variety in her canvasses. The artist's delineation of well-worn houses is > unique as her interpretation of them in color, and there is nothing we like > more than the simple but fruitful wedding of line and color mass. Control of > detail is, in this case, an additional gift. Canvases may be flooded with > subsidiary graphic or pigmental themes, but there is never confusion. Grace > Gemberling is one of Philadelphia's most promising painters. Grace Gemberling, \\"Colonial Stairway,\\" about 1943, oil on canvas, height: 35 inches, width: 26 inches Concerning the painting \\"Colonial Stairway\\" Chalfont wrote: \\"One of the more realistically interpreted compositions by Gemberling, this is clearly the \\"Montmorenci\\" Stair Hall at Winterthur Museum. Wonder- fully rendered, this painting invites the viewer into the opulence of the interior and demonstrates her deep ap- preciation for the Winterthur Museum and the impressive collection within.\\" =Exhibitions and awards= The exhibitions in which Gemberling participated were mostly non-commercial. The two organizations that showed her work more than any others were both ones where she had been a student: She contributed paintings, watercolors, and drawings to nearly all the annual exhibitions held by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts between 1927 and 1943 and to many of the annual exhibitions held at Friends' Central School between 1934 and 1955. Other non-commercial organizations that showed her work on multiple occasions included the Plastic Club of Philadelphia, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the North Shore Art Association, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Non-commercial organizations that showed her a single time included the City Art Museum of St. Louis (1930), Salons of America (New York, 1932), Philadelphia Water Color Club (1926), National Academy of Design (New York, 1932), Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, 1934), Society of Independent Artists (New York, 1934), Studio House (Washington, D.C., 1936), Women's University Club (Philadelphia, 1938), Federal Art Project show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1938), and Everyman's Gallery (Art Alliance, Philadelphia, 1953). Her relatively few exhibitions in private galleries included a solo exhibition at the Mellon Galleries in Philadelphia (1933), Gimbel Galleries in Philadelphia (1935) and group shows at the Boyer Gallery's two locations, Philadelphia, and New York (both in 1936). Gemberling was known for the number of important awards she had won. Most came from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, which honored her twice with its highly valued student award, the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, in 1923 and 1924, and twice with its Fellowship Prize, given by members of the Academy to one of its own (1931, 1940). It also awarded her the Lambert Purchase Prize and the Mary Smith Prize for best painting by a Philadelphia woman artist, both in 1930, and a Gold Medal for her painting \\"Landscape.\\" She also won the Oliver Beck Figure Composition Prize from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1933. Art teacher During the 1930s Gemberling gave art instruction in her studio in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. One of her students, Jane Piper, later became a well-known artist. Personal life and family Gemberling was born on July 31, 1903. Her parents were Joseph Burton Gemberling and Lulu Sarah Thorp Gemberling who married December 28, 1898, and whose home was in \\"Ivy Cottage,\\" Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Her father was born in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania in 1867 and died in 1943. He was a successful construction manager for a company that built bridges. Her mother was born in 1880. Gemberling had an older sister named Josephine who performed in concert on the violin in the years prior to her marriage in 1927 to Donald Robb Cochran. The family spent summer vacations on the Gemberling farm in Selinsgrove. Gemberling was educated at Friends Central School in Philadelphia before enrolling in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In the late 1930s Gemberling married a well known Philadelphia architect, W. R. Morton Keast, and remained married to him until his death. Keast had two daughters by a prior marriage. He and Gemberling had no children. Keast was the chief designer for the architectural firm run by John T. Windrim. In the 1920s and 1930s he designed a number of major buildings in Philadelphia including the Franklin Institute, the Municipal Court Building, the Wannamaker's Men's Store (now known as One South Broad, and the Fidelity Bank Building. He was born in Germantown in 1888 and died Bala Cynwyd in 1873. From the late 1940s through the 1960s Gemberling was active in Philadelphia society. The great- granddaughter of a Revolutionary War veteran (Johann Jacob Gemberling), she joined and became leader (Regent) of the Thomas Leiper chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She was also an active member of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Society of Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America, the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, and the Pennsylvania Society of New England Women. Gemberling was an avid gardener and member of the Philadelphia Society of Little Gardens. She died on December 26, 1997, and was buried in the West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd. Other names used Gemberling's full name was Grace Thorp Gemberling. Thorp was her mother's maiden name; it is sometimes given as Thorpe. She commonly used Grace Gemberling prior to her marriage although sometimes she would use Grace T. Gemberling. The New York Times usually referred to her as Grace Thorp Gemberling. In addition to these name usages, following her marriage she was also called Grace Gemberling Keast, Grace Keast, Grace G. Keast, or Mrs. W. R. Morton Keast.

Though evidence points to the tomb of a wealthy local, popular belief is that the \\"martyrs of Singidunum\\", Hermylus and Stratonicus, were buried inside. As one of the most important monuments from the Roman period, the tomb is protected since 1948.  Location  Village of Brestovik The tomb is situated in the village of Brestovik in Belgrade's municipality of Grocka, on the locality of Vuka≈°inova crkva.Gradska op≈°tina Grocka - Rimska grobnica (in Serbian) It is dug into the hill of Zlatno brdo (\\"Golden hill\\").  Discovery and explorations  The tomb was discovered by accident in 1895. The owner of the lot, Vuka≈°in Milosavljeviƒá, was planting seedlings in his plum orchard, when he hit the arch of the vault with his spade. He notified the authorities and in September 1895 Mihailo Valtroviƒá, the curator of the National Museum in Belgrade and founder of the archaeology in Serbia, was dispatched to the site. He conducted the excavations and uncovered the entire tomb. It was conserved and protected in 1905, while the excavations have been done in 1955 and 1964. In 1964 the tomb was adapted the way it looks today and was open for visitors as the stone stairway was built to make the access easier.  Characteristics  The structure was built in the late 3rd or an early 4th century. It is partially dug into the slope of the hill on which the modern village cemetery is today. The tomb is oriented in the east-west direction with the entrance being on the eastern side. It is approached by an elongated, entry section, which is cut into the slope. The tomb was built from crushed stone, river pebble and bricks, all connected with the Roman lime plaster made with volcanic sand, and itself consists of three rooms: * porch; separated by the entry section by four pillars, it was paved with the six-sided bricks. It is connected with the central room by the door and stairs, as the porch is higher. * central room; it has two side apsides, on the north and south, and was also paved with the six-sided bricks. The walls were covered with frescoes, which faded completely. The room was also ornamented with the marble statues and two figures of lions lying down. Two sculptures represented death geniuses (in the form of boys mourning the deceased) and at least one was of a sad Cupid, a winged boy sitting on a pedestal, while the lyons \\"guarded\\" the burial chamber. In one of the apsides was the life-sized sculpture of the Roman soldier (lacking the head) and a bust in Roman military clothing, which points that he was either a military commander or a high ranked clerk who was awarded with an estate. It is suggested that the room was used for sacrificial gifts to the departed. It is separated from the burial chamber by the massive wooden door and two windows. * burial chamber; it is rectangular, with the half-domed brick arch. It was also covered with frescoes which are, unlike the central room, still visible today in the chamber's inner section. They are best preserved on the walls and the ceiling. The frescoes represent a different geometry motifs, combined with the plants and animals in different colors: ochre, cinnabar, blue, green, brown and red. The southern and northern walls have the motifs of fishes and waterfowls while the west has partially recognizable human figures, probably the likes of the buried ones. The chamber contained three built sarcophagi. Part of the arch was collapsed, but was restored later, as were some of the frescoes. The porch and the central room are partially visible from above the ground, while the chamber is completely embedded into the hill. Later excavations in 1955 showed that the complex wasn't built at the same time. The burial chamber is the oldest while the rest was built later. Today, all the rooms are empty as sarcophagi and sculptures were taken away - some looted long time ago and some disappeared after the tomb was discovered. It is the first discovered ancient multi-chambered tomb in Belgrade. Characteristics point to the Roman (pagan) sepulchral structure, which probably belonged to the wealthy family which had an estate and a villa in the vicinity, probably of a noble or a military commander. The disposition of the edifice and parts of the sculptures show the connection with the pagan heroons and shrines of the Imperial cult. Considering the tomb's elements and their relations, it marks the link between the Antiquity and early Christian buildings, a progenitor type from which the complex Christian structures of the burial cult developed. Within its period, it shows the connections with other Late Roman monuments, up to 6th century, on the territory of Serbia, but also much wider, on the Balkans and the Middle East. Closest analogy can be found with certain tombs discovered in Syria.  Protection and reconstruction  Valtroviƒá described it as one of the \\"most precious monuments from the Antiquity, not only in Belgrade, but in Serbia\\". It was protected on 12 February 1948 as the cultural monument of great importance by the Institute for protection of the monuments (Decision No. 200/48), and was declared a cultural heritage of great importance by the state in 1979 (Slu≈æbeni glasnik Socijalistiƒçke Republike Srbije, No. 14/79). Partial conservation was done in 1964. Since 2016, the Institute was drafting the project of repairing the tomb from the moist damage and conservation of the frescoes in the burial chamber. A joint project of several institutions for the conservation and restoration was finished in January 2020. Plans were also made to nominate it to be a part of the interstate protected area of the Limes of the Roman Empire, in its Danube section in Serbia (also including Belgrade Fortress, Viminacium, etc.). In terms of construction itself, the tomb is in relatively good shape, but the main problem is the moist which highly endangered the fresco paintings, with painted plaster falling off. As the access path is passing through the privately owned lot, it will be relocated, with the usual additional objects (new gate, road and tourist signs, benches, greenery around the tomb, etc.).  Saint Hermylus and Stratonicus  Depiction of the drowning of Hermylus and Stratonicus in the Menologion of Basil II Roman emperors Constantine I the Great and Licinius signed the Edict of Milan in 313 which made Christianity one of the official religions in the Roman Empire. Licinius, who ruled in the east, soon clashed with Constantine so he outlawed the Christians again. According to the church hagiography from the 5th century, Hermylus, a Christian, was imprisoned and managed to convert one of his guards, Stratonicus. Licinius ordered for both of them to be tortured and drowned, so in the end they were put in one coffin and, still alive, thrown below the Singidunum Fortress at the Sava's mouth into the Danube, in 314 or 315. The coffin was stranded on the shore 18 stadia downstream, allegedly near modern Brestovik. Local Christians buried them in the brick tomb embedded into the hill. They were canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church and their feast day is 26 January. This prompted clerics and theologians to conclude that the Roman tomb in Brestovik is actually a tomb of Hermylus and Stratonicus. Experts didn't find anything that would point to the Christian tomb. Furthermore, one of two discovered sarcophagi in 1895 was a \\"female\\" one, and it was apparently a family tomb for a man, woman and a child. In addition, Brestovik is much further from Belgrade than 18 stadia (c. ). Despite protests from the experts, institutions and the owners of the lot, local clergy and worshipers entered the tomb in 2014, bringing icons, candles and flowers, and holding services, which partially damaged the monument. As the tomb leans on modern cemetery, the church offered to the owners to buy the lot from them so that an entrance directly though the graveyard could be built, but they refused. Supported by several professors from the Faculty of Theology, the church considers the tomb an \\"early Christian church\\", that third, unknown person, was also buried with two saints, and that local population removed the remains from the sarcophagi so that advancing Huns or Avars wouldn't desecrate the tomb. In 2016 local clergy started an initiative to build a church over the tomb. Serbian Orthodox Church again tried to buy the property from the current owners who again refused and the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments stated that the tomb is under protection and that nothing can't be built over it, regardless of the ownership, unless the Institute allows it. Church archaeologists claim that the saints were originally hastily buried in the Grocka's region of Duboƒçaj, a bit to the west, and then were reinterred to the new tomb in Brestovik when it was built. They claim that existence of the windows in the chamber prove that it was a room with relics and that one of the faint fresco figures is actually a Virgin Mary with Jesus, with two halos. Archaeologists disputed all this, saying that the image of Virgin Mary with Jesus was not yet used in that period and that absolutely everything discovered in the tomb shows that it is a \\"classical mausoleum of the high positioned member of an aristocratic family, [probably] an official or employee in the administration of Singidunum\\". The municipality of Grocka granted the permit to the Serbian Orthodox Church to build a church in Brestovik, but not on the location of the tomb as they can't do it without the Institute's permission. However, there are many stories among the local population about other tombs, still undiscovered, embedded into the hills, but no archaeological works have been done other than this locality. The entire area is actually a possible archaeological site with numerous embedded tombs. Only this one was preserved, which doesn't exclude the possibility that there are other, undiscovered ones.

Their western boundary lay on the southern side of the Rudall River as far as the Robertson Range and the eastern headwaters of both the Jigalong and Savory Creeks. The country was characterized by endemic parallel sand-dune formations. History Around the 1890s the Kartudjara pressured the Niabali to their northwest, off Savory Creek, forcing them to move roughly 60 miles to Balfour Downs. The Kartudjara thereafter went on to water at the Rudall River, which became in time their northern frontier. Their neighbours beyond the mulga were the spinifex plainsmen, the Wanman and the Nyangumarta. The Kartudjara became, in recent times, one of the two core constituent tribal groups forming the Martu. That term actually signified 'northerners', but originally was used primarily to denote people who had undergone initiation rites to become fully-fledged tribesmen.

History  The Hontoria guns were designed by Jos√© Gonz√°lez Hontoria a Spanish inventor, field marshal of marine infantry and brigadier of the navy. During the 1800s Spain lagged behind other European powers in industrialization and Spain imported weapons from Krupp, Armstrong Whitworth and Schneider et Cie. During the 1860s and 1870s, Hontoria studied explosives, metallurgy, and industrial production with the aim of developing an indigenous arms industry.  Construction  In 1879 Hontoria designed a series of naval guns ranging from to which would lay the foundation for his later guns. The 1879 series like Ord√≥√±ez guns of the same period were breech loading, black powder, built up guns, with steel A tube and cast iron reinforcing hoops. The 1883 series was a step forward in that they were breech loading, built up guns, with forged steel A tube and forged steel reinforcing hoops. The Hontoria 1883 series ranged in size from to and were 35 calibers in length. They were produced by the Arsenal de la Carraca in Cadiz and the Royal Ordnance Works at Trubia in Asturias. During the 1890s some 12 cm, 14 cm and 16 cm were converted to quick fire guns with assistance from Schneider et Cie. Criticisms of the 1883 series guns: * Outdated design - Some argue that the 1883 series production methods were outdated compared to its European rivals. The counter argument is Spain only recently switched to producing steel weapons and purchasing a foreign design would do nothing to promote self- sufficiency in weapons design and production. Also that the cost of retooling to produce another design would have meant that recent infrastructure improvements were a wasted investment. * Slow rate of fire - Some argue that the 1883 series should have been designed as quick firing weapons from the beginning and that attempts to convert them to quick firing were unsuccessful. The counter argument is that Spain didn't have that experience and it would have meant delaying production schedules when they were already delayed due to insufficient industrial capacity. * Short barrel length - Some argue that the 35 caliber length was too short when compared to its European rivals who were producing 45 caliber guns and that the short barrel length didn't leverage the power of new smokeless powders efficiently. The counter argument is that Spanish industry didn't have the capacity to produce longer barrels, having only recently switched to steel production. Also that the powders of the time needed reformulation to increase efficiency and increasing barrel length was only partial fix.  Naval Use  16 cm Hontoria 1883 guns armed a variety of ships such as ironclads and unprotected cruisers of the Spanish Navy. Ironclad Battleships: * Pelayo - The tertiary armament of this ship consisted of eight casemated 12 cm guns amidships and one casemated 16 cm chaser gun in the bow. The Pelayo was in the middle of a refit during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War which was supposed to replace her 16 cm and 12 cm Hontoria guns with 14 cm Hontoria guns. She was recalled to service before the refit was complete and saw no action during the war. Unprotected Cruisers: * Alfonso XII-class - The three ships of this class had a primary armament of six shielded 16 cm guns in sponsons amidships. Two ships of this class would see action during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. On the night of 2‚Äì3 June 1898, gunfire from Reina Mercedes contributed to the sinking of the USS Merrimac while on an unsuccessful blockship mission in Santiago Harbor. Reina Cristina was sunk during the Battle of Manila Bay and Reina Mercedes was sunk during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Reina Mercedes was later raised, repaired and commissioned in the US Navy under her former name.  Coastal Artillery  Six guns removed from the Reina Mercedes found a second life as Coastal Artillery defending Santiago Harbor, Cuba. Four guns were installed at batteries at Socapa and two at Punta Gorda. A shell from the Socapa battery slightly damaged the USS Texas during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.  Ammunition  The guns used separate loading, bagged smokeless powder charges weighing and projectiles.

Originally trained as a sculptor, Narkeviƒçius has mainly been working with film and video. Employing documentary footage, voice- overs, interviews, re-enactments and found photographs, his films submit historical events to the narrative structures of storytelling and cinema. In his artistic practice Narkeviƒçius examines the relationship of personal memories to political histories, particularly those of his native Lithuania. For the artist history, itself has become both material and methodology. Since 1992 Narkeviƒçius has exhibited extensively around the world at some important contemporary art venues and events including Centre Pompidou (Paris), Museo Nacional Centro De Arte Reina Sofia (Madrid), Tate Modern (London), Museum of Modern Art (New York), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). He represented Lithuania at the 49th Venice Biennale in 2001 and two years later exhibited at the 50th Venice Biennale in Utopia Station curated by Molly Nesbit and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Narkeviƒçius's work was shown at Manifesta II (Luxembourg, 1998) and Manifesta X (St. Petersburg, 2014). Amongst his most recent solo shows are 20 July.2015 at Maureen Paley (London, 2017), Books on Shelves and Without Letters at The Blank Contemporary Art (Bergamo, 2016), Archeology of Memories at former KGB building (Riga, 2015). Narkeviƒçius's major retrospective opens at the National Gallery of Art in Vilnius, Lithuania, in December 2017. Narkeviƒçius's works are a part of major private and public collections such as Tate Modern (London), Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Modern Art Museum (Vilnius). In 2008 for his achievements in art Narkeviƒçius has been awarded the Vincent Award and the Lithuanian National Prize for Culture and Arts. His film Restricted Sensation (2011) was a nominee for the best short feature at the 2012 Silver Crane film awards. Deimantas Narkeviƒçius lives and works in Vilnius, Lithuania.  Biography  = Childhood in Utena = Deimantas Narkeviƒçius was born in Utena, Lithuania, in 1964 at the time when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union. In several interviews such as in the one from 2003 with curator Hans Ulrich Obrist Narkeviƒçius reflected on the importance of films he saw in his early childhood. His first experience of cinema was watching movies with his parents in the theatre or at home on television. Films by prominent Soviet directors such as Sergei Eisenstein, in particular, his Ivan Grozny, Part II (1958) which he saw at the age of five, and Bronenosec Potiomkin (1925), were among his earliest cinematic experiences that in Narkeviƒçius's own words had a dramatic impact on him. Later in his early adolescence Narkeviƒçius familiarised with the cinema of his time even further by seeing Sergei Parajanov's Hakob Hovnatanyan (1967) which again had a significant impact on the young artist. It was then that he became fascinated with the films produced in the studios of the Soviet republics, which revealed local identities, traditions and languages. In another interview from 2011 Narkeviƒçius described technological and stylistic aspects of Parajanov's film that moved him as a young person: Growing up Narkeviƒçius was often ill which meant he had to stay at home. As a result, he spent a considerable amount of time watching Soviet television. The documentary material on the 16mm film that used to be on TV in the 1970s made an impression on Narkeviƒçius who later used the same type of film extensively in his artistic practice. Interviews were filmed with 16mm cameras, and then they were processed and made ready for the evening news on the same day. Since they were done in quite a rush, it provoked considerable experimentation. These films were screened and then broadcast, raising a range of possibilities for using film. Narkeviƒçius who grew familiar with these images admitted to the ingenuity of their production and the effect it had on him even after many years: \\"I sometimes look back at them, and I see how creative they were ‚Äì how creative the camerawork and the editing was\\". The early influences of cinema and television describe Narkeviƒçius's artistic style and means of production. They can potentially be seen as a factor that affected his decision of selecting filmmaking as opposed to object making early in his career. The history and context of the Soviet Union in which these early experiences were produced had become the principal subject of Narkeviƒçius's oeuvre. = Student years in Vilnius and London = At the age of fourteen Narkeviƒçius was sent to Vilnius by his parents to study in the art boarding school where he matured surrounded by students who came from similar backgrounds. According to the artist, during this period, still in the Soviet Union, everything was quite impersonal, and at the beginning of his artistic career, he was trying to personalise what he was doing to motivate himself. Artists at that time were seen as advertisers of the regime ‚Äì which compared with post-war Stalinism was relatively liberal. However, the primary purpose of artists still was to provide an ideological service, he or she always had to be prepared for it. After finishing secondary school, at the age eighteen, for a year and a half Narkeviƒçius worked in a museum that exhibited a collection of Soviet art. In an interview with Melissa Gronlund, he admitted that he was amazed at how funny those artworks were to him. Later in 1987 Narkeviƒçius enrolled in Vilnius Art Institute (now Vilnius Academy of Arts) where he chose to study sculpture. The academy's curriculum was rigid and didn't excite him as much as he would have expected. In his own words, prominent Lithuanian expatriate artists Jonas Mekas and George Maƒçi≈´nas meant more to him than any teacher he had at that time. Between 1992 and 1993, while still a member of the Vilnius Academy of Arts, Narkeviƒçius lived in London, UK. In England, he was exploring possibilities of object making and approaching the medium from a conceptual standpoint. London was an exciting place to be for the emerging artist. This period which was marked by intensive learning had a significant impact for Narkeviƒçius's understanding of contemporary art as he got exposed to London's art milieu, for example, artists of the YBA generation, but more so for his motivation for becoming an artist. A dense concentration of artists and a competitive artistic climate meant that the standards for art were set high, but it also led to a strong community sense. Artists were often collaborating and helping each other in different ways. Narkeviƒçius who was one of them was able to benefit from these processes. After his return from London Narkeviƒçius was interested in site-specific objects and continued producing sculptural works. However, after a short while, he realised that he was leaning towards the storytelling and felt that he needed to find a better media for that. As a result, he began recording interviews with people from his environment. For the emerging artist, it proved to be a perfect medium for developing narratives as well as for exploring sound and visual language. = Film career = Since the late 90s, Narkeviƒçius worked mostly in film and video, experimenting with the film structure and thematising the weight of individual memories and personal revisions of history. The majority of his films deal extensively with the cultural legacy of Communism, and attempts to erase it after the fall of the Warsaw Pact regimes in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union two years later, with an emphasis on statues, sculptors, artists and moving images. These themes first emerged in his early films Europa, 54¬∞ 54' ‚Äì 25¬∞ 19 (1997), Legend Coming True (1999), and Energy Lithuania (2000). A 7-minute 35mm film His-story (1998) shown at Manifesta II in 1998 gained the artist international recognition making Narkeviƒçius into one of the leading contemporary filmmakers of the Eastern European region. In 2001, Narkeviƒçius represented Lithuania at the 49th Venice Biennale. Two years later he came back to Venice to show his work in the Utopia Station curated by Molly Nesbit and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Describing his work's relationship with his nation's past in an interview with Obrist, Narkeviƒçius said that, \\"Memory is a funny thing. I think our brain has a filter: you remember what you want to remember. And you recreate the stories of the memory in a way that you want to remember them and how you would like to create them\\". In perhaps his best-known film The Role of a Lifetime (2003), commissioned by UK-based organisation Art and Sacred Places for a parish church in Brighton, Narkeviƒçius asked what it meant to be a filmmaker with a social conscience. The centrepiece of the film is an interview with British director Peter Watkins whose politically-charged, fictionalised documentary-style works had addressed the Hungarian uprising, The Battle of Culloden (1964), and the La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000), and who had left the UK in frustration at censorship and neglect settling in Vilnius. The interview is juxtaposed with 1960s Super-8 footage of Brighton & Hove, and sketches by Lithuanian artist Mindaugas Luko≈°aitis of Gr≈´tas Park, the sculpture garden 80 miles south of Vilnius where many of the country's Soviet monuments ended up after the fall of the Soviet Union. Noting that some people considered the decision to save the statues \\"a disaster\\", Watkins described the park as a place to contemplate \\"man's unbelievable folly and inhumanity ... and sadly, the endless repetition of history\\". Narkeviƒçius's next film, Once in the XX Century (2004) played with the Lithuanian television footage, that was broadcast across the world, of the statue of Lenin being torn down in Vilnius's Luki≈°kƒós Square in 1991. Recutting it in reverse, Narkeviƒçius showed a jubilant crowd cheering the monument as it was hoisted from the back of a vehicle onto a plinth, being reunited with its legs. In Once in the XX Century he continued to explore and contextualise the problematics of public monument and monumentality ‚Äì a central theme in Narkeviƒçius's artistic practice. The Head (2007) consisted entirely of photographs and archival footage made for East German television. The film documents the creation of the world's second-largest head sculpture ‚Äì a seven- metre-high profile of Karl Marx by Soviet socialist-realist Lev Kerbel (1917‚Äì2003) ‚Äì from its conception in 1968 to its unveiling in Karl-Marx Stadt (now Chemnitz) in 1971. Narkeviƒçius commented on his film by saying: \\"Objects from that period are not a crime. They are rather testimonies to historical crimes, visual heritage of an era to be kept and appreciated: if we want to feel any compassion for what the people who lived then lost, and in order to separate individuals from their creatively inhibited artworks ‚Äì even if the consequences of this aesthetical repression can still be felt in the Eastern Bloc ...\\". For Revisiting Solaris (2007) Narkeviƒçius adapted the final chapter of Stanis≈Çaw Lem's novel Solaris (1961), which Andrei Tarkovsky left out in his 1972 film. In Narkeviƒçius's film Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis reprised his role as Chris Kelvin after more than 30 years. In Revisiting Solaris Narkeviƒçius used a series of photographs taken by prominent Lithuanian symbolist painter Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis in Anapa (now Russia) in 1905 to represent the foreign planet, as well as Eduard Artemyev's iconic score from the original film. Revisiting Solaris marked an outstanding interdisciplinary effort by the Lithuanian filmmaker to join multiple talents from different periods making it into a timeless monument. Restricted Sensation (2011) was Narkeviƒçius first long feature that was shown in cinemas. A 45-minute length film depicts the abuse of a talented young gay theatre director in the Lithuanian SSR in the 1970s, with the post-Stalinist re- criminalisation of homosexuality representing the oppressive cultural policy that took hold as Stalin assumed total power in the late 1920s. Although it can be read as a comment both on that period's homophobia and Vladimir Putin's current persecution of Russia's LGBTQI population, Narkeviƒçius said he was not aiming to depict the explicit, illegal life of gays in the Soviet Union. Rather, the film comments on \\"the distrust and intolerance of what is perceived as foreign to a particular country‚Äôs culture\\" and was \\"an attempt to identify the causes of the increasing prevalence of intolerance\\". His most recent work, 20 July.2015 (2016), traces the removal of several socialist realist sculptures from the Green Bridge in central Vilnius, Lithuania, which had been erected in 1952. Presented in immersive 3D ‚Äì Narkeviƒçius's first use of the medium ‚Äì it culminates in the final removal of the monuments at 2 a.m. on 20 July 2015.  Artistic work  = The Role of a Lifetime = Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Lithuania, 2003 17 minutes, Colour/B&W;, Stereo, 4:3 Original format: 8mm, Super 8mm and 35mm film Deimantas Narkeviƒçius The Role of a Lifetime (film still), 2003. Drawing by Mindaugas Luko≈°aitis It is perhaps The Role of a Lifetime (2003) that most evocatively and thoughtfully ties together Narkeviƒçius's interests in the uncertainties at the heart of post-Soviet Lithuania with the implications of his own work in creating film and video. The film combines three distinct elements. The first one is an interview with the British filmmaker Peter Watkins that Narkeviƒçius recorded in Lithuania. Known for his pioneering docudrama films Culloden (1964) and The War Game (1965), which politicised and fictionalised the documentary form, Watkins lived in Vilnius for many years in the course of his self-imposed exile from Britain. The second is a sequence of drawings of the Lithuanian landscape by Lithuanian artist Mindaugas Luko≈°aitis. A number of these drawing show Gr≈´to Park, a kind of Soviet theme park in the south of Lithuania, that acts as a repository of Social Realist sculptures from the post-war era. The third is a footage of Brighton life shot by an amateur film enthusiast Geoffrey Cook which Narkeviƒçius found in archives in Brighton. In works like Punishment Park (1970) or La Commune (Paris 1871) (2000), Watkins has challenged what he calls the \\"monoform\\": cinematographic editing that reduces disparate visual and acoustic parts to a narrative whole. Narkeviƒçius undoes the monoform by putting together images and sounds that do not match each other in what appears to be a biographical documentary. The film scenes are too idyllic and too recent for the traumatic World War II childhood that Watkins recollects; a summer hum of birds and insects accompanies his description of the Soviet monuments collected in Gr≈´to, and the pencil sketches of the park show a thick layer of snow covering the defunct socialist heroes. Maybe the wizened man in the stills is not Watkins but the protagonist of yet another history. More dialogical than monological, The Role of a Lifetime ends up highlighting distinct bodies of work and visions: Narkeviƒçius's audio interviews with Watkins, drawings by Mindaugas Luko≈°aitis (filmed by Audrius Keme≈æys, who catches Luko≈°aitis's hand), and archival footage of Brighton filmed by Geoffrey Cook in the 1960s. In his role as a master editor, Narkeviƒçius mismatches these silent images and invisible sounds not only to question documentary's veracity but also to begin that elusive discussion with the audience, who must put parts together. Experiencing the gap between Watkin's eloquent remarks on creativity and Cook's quirky views of Brighton comes close to participant observation. Cook's Brighton initially appears to be part of Watkin's childhood memories, only to emerge as the eye of yet another filmmaker; in this shift, the cathartic hit of nostalgia, instantly delivered by Super 8, dissolves into two visions of the past, whose incommensurability makes them all the more fascinating. As in other works, in The Role of a Lifetime, it is Narkeviƒçius's editing of the quotidian and the unmonumental qualities of everyday life that complicate the material and bring it into dialogue with the misplaced authoritarianism of the dead monuments. Watkins's attention to reinterpreting history and continually bringing it into dialogue with the present-day ‚Äì resistance to pushing the past away out of sight and mind ‚Äì is mirrored in the dystopic/utopic space of the sculpture park, neither alive, nor dead, but fully both. As rendered by Narkeviƒçius the space represents the indigestible qualities of these objects, burdened by their role as icons of a past regime. Both Watkins and Narkeviƒçius share a profound scepticism about images that promise to be authentic representations of history. Independently of each other they have produced films with similar concerns: dismantling the conventional visual rhetoric of historic testimony and searching for a cinematic language that does not subject the history to the forces of ideological assimilation or mass media commodification. = Once in the XX Century = Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Lithuania, 2004 7 minutes, 56 seconds, Colour, Stereo, 4:3 Original format: Betacam SP video Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Once in the XX Century (film still), 2004 Once in the XX Century (2004) is based on video documentation of the removal of a monumental public sculpture of Lenin from Luki≈°ki≈≥ Square in Lithuania in 1991. The artist acquired footage from the Lithuanian National TV archive and a freelance video reporter to have a two-camera perspective on the event. These images of the figure hanging above the crowd with his hand raised have been broadcast hundreds of times by CNN and other news channels over the last decades as a symbol of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism. In Deimantas Narkeviƒçius's video, Lenin's ghost statue is reinstalled. Recutting the action in reverse, Narkeviƒçius shows a violently enthusiastic crowd cheering a statue as it is paraded on the back of a vehicle, and raised into the air to then swing uncannily into place, as Lenin is seamlessly reunited with his legs. The demise of Eastern European socialist regimes at the end of the twentieth century led to the removal of many such monuments, taken down by either the state or the people themselves in hope for a better future. For many, this hope has not been fulfilled. Narkeviƒçius's historical reversal ironically points to the repetition of scenes in history and talks about the longing for or denial of political and economic systems. Once in the XX Century throws into relief the absurdity of the scene as a potential event ‚Äì the public barely ever gets as wild about installing authority as it does about dismantling it. However, the video also reveals a moment of breakage in the country's history, mirrored in the ruin-image of a pair of calves and feet stranded on a plinth with no body or head. Moments of dramatic political violently break the future open, to reveal an unnervingly undefined limbo. However, a violent break with the past such as this ‚Äì when it is open season on the symbols of the powers just ousted ‚Äì is also a moment of groundless suspension. In 2005 Flash Art used an image of the figure of Lenin from Narkeviƒçius film to promote the 2nd Prague Biennale (2005). The description mistakenly said it was the statue of Lenin being removed from Kaluzhskaya Square (former October Square) in Moscow, Russia. In reality, Lenin statue is still in Kaluzhskaya Square. = Revisiting Solaris = Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Lithuania, 2007 18 minutes, Colour/B&W;, Stereo, 16:9 Original format: 35mm film Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Revisiting Solaris (film still), 2008. Narkeviƒçius first saw Andrej Tarkovsky's film in the 1970s. In an interview with Larissa Harris he admitted that then, when he was about sixteen or seventeen, he did not get it at all, simply not understanding what was going on in the film. Nevertheless, it engaged him and raised his curiosity. Later on Narkeviƒçius watched Solaris over and over again. \\"I kept watching it until, having reached my thirties, I finally liked it a lot. Perhaps that was also due to the fact that I started to lose people who were close to me\\". Out of Tarkovsky's film language, Lem's book, photographs by Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, and Donatas Banionis Narkeviƒçius made another Solaris. In the same conversation, Narkeviƒçius stressed the fact that within his film he meets Chris Kelvin and not Donatas Banionis. Revisiting Solaris is in a way an extension of the Tarkovsky's film, many years later. Donatas Banionis who initially was not so keen on reprising his role did not have any reflection on his role in Narkeviƒçius's film and did not make any comments on the old film either, according to the artist he simply \\"is\\" Chris Kelvin again. In Solaris, before Donatas Banionis as Chris Kelvin leaves Earth, the old pilot Burton attacks him as \\"not fit to go into space\\" and \\"an accountant, not a scientist\\". In Revisiting Solaris, Banionis/Kelvin and an unnamed woman who is played by Narkeviƒçius's wife say these words to the artist who in such a way himself becomes young Chris Kelvin. The difference between Tarkovsky's and Narkeviƒçius's versions of the scene is that take-off does not happen. The image of the planet Solaris is represented as Banionis/Kelvin's memories. The mysterious planet is revisited by evoking both the memories of a man who was \\"there\\" some time ago and also viewers' collective memories of the Tarkovsky's film. \\"There\\" happened in the form of a fiction film in 1972, but Narkeviƒçius accepts it as reality. As with his other work, Narkeviƒçius is awaking something anachronistic, something that has gone from our every-day (or contemporary media) experience. By bringing a real man, a witness to an outstanding cinematographic achievement like Solaris by A. Tarkovsky, he emphasises that some dimensions of the film remain relevant. The presence of D. Banionis is also a link between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\", between created reality and its impact on a viewer many years later. \\"The man is among us, the way he moves is the same, his look is the same, so 1972 is still 'present'.‚Äù Most of the selected locations seen in Revisiting Solaris are functional architecture from the period of radical modernisation. They are linked with the recent past, which for Narkeviƒçius was very much about creating a future. In comparison, in Solaris, the future is represented by the beautiful shots of the roads and highways Tarkovsky took in Tokyo in 1970. Narkeviƒçius chose the locations for Banionis to discover them. When talking to L. Harris, he said that he wanted him to establish contact with those spaces, accommodate them with his presence while being filmed. The room with two telephones, for example, is a former KGB prison, now the Museum of Genocide Victims in Vilnius where decades ago people were killed for political reasons. For that scene, Narkeviƒçius chose an excerpt from Lem's book that talks about the nature of human thoughts. \\"What potential dangers can result from materialisation of some thoughts? What \\"phantoms\\" were generated by human minds in recent history?‚Äù Narkeviƒçius rhetorically asks the viewers of his film.  Objects  Deimantas Narkeviƒçius Too Long on a Pedestal, 1994 Although Deimantas Narkeviƒçius is primarily known for his cinematographic work, he started his career working with sculpture and found objects. Narkeviƒçius's aim to personalise the relationship between the artist and his work emerged during his study years in Vilnius Academy of Arts, as also did his search for a means of expression matching the conceptual idea. It prompted him to embrace the avant-garde tradition and the principles of site-specific art. At that stage, he sought to cast off the dominant romantic concept of art and actualise other principles of visual expression that would directly and didactically reflect the thinking of the artist. His one-year stay in London was crucial in this regard because it was there that he introduced ready-made into his artistic practice. Narkeviƒçius's sculptures actively question preconceptions regarding day-to-day objects, assigning them new and indeterminate functions. He builds his creative platform by siting them in the historical context of the environment they belong to. In such a way Narkeviƒçius creates a new semantic field to communicate his ideas via the physical form. The work Too Long on a Pedestal was made in 1994, when the Lithuanian public was still affected by the huge political and social shifts of the early 1990s. The stagnant and morally compromised ideological system that had dominated social life for nearly 50 years was being replaced by a new one. This work, tinged with subtle humour, is a reflection on how the heritage of the political system becomes history. The means of expression selected by the artist, a pair of worn-out classic-style shoes, now filled with coarse salt, points to the statues of heroes that used to embody the value system of the former epoch, but the people promptly removed them from their pedestals, as politics changed its course.

By tradition he was also the twenty-sixth Baron of Foulis. Before he died a dispute took place over the legitimacy of his daughter, resulting in a lawsuit. Early life Sir Hugh Munro was the son of Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet and his wife Ann Rose, daughter of Hugh Rose, XIV of Kilravock, chief of the Clan Rose.Mackenzie. p. 145. Shortly after the death of his father in 1781 Sir Hugh moved to London where he resided for many years. In 1794 whilst in London Sir Hugh entered into what Mackenzie describes as an irregular union with Jane, daughter of Alexander Law, a native of Aberdeenshire. The couple married on 24 September 1801 in accordance with Scots Law. Shortly after they married they took up their residence at Foulis Castle, Ross-shire.Mackenzie. p. 147. Death of wife On 3 August 1803, Sir Hugh‚Äôs wife Jane drowned in the Bay of Cromarty near Foulis Castle, having gone to there bathe. Three other people were also drowned in the same incident having apparently gone out of their depth in the water and although their cries brought the assistance of a boat, it apparently arrived after they had drowned. Lawsuit and legitimacy of daughter Sir Hugh and his wife Jane had an only daughter Mary Seymour Munro who was born 14 November 1796 in London.Mackenzie. p. 148. A lawsuit subsequently ensued as to the legitimacy of Mary and her right to succeed to the Foulis estates. Ultimately Mary succeeded and continued for several years. Doubts were raised of Mary's legitimacy with the absence of legitimate heirs from Hugh meaning that George Munro of Culrain would succeed, given that the male line of Munro of Culcairn was (allegedly) extinct. However, even though the marriage of Mary's parents in England after her birth legitimized her, the estate of Foulis and Baronetcy of Foulis would still be separated with the latter still going to Munro of Culrain. According to Mackenzie the separation of the title and the estates would have been a serious matter to the Munros of Culrain, who as would-be chiefs of the clan would be almost landless and as such it can be readily believed that interested persons were spreading reports that Mary was illegitimate and that her parent's marriage in England several years after her birth would not have the same effect of legitimization in Scotland. It became necessary for Mary, with the assistance of her father Hugh, to establish her legitimacy.Mackenzie. p. 149 - 153. As a result, on 27 May 1831 a summons and declaratory of legitimacy was issued by the Court of Session against the Munros of Culrain, in accordance with Sir Harry Munro's deed of entail the terms of which said that the descendants of Hugh should succeed first, if that line failed then the Munros of Culcairn, followed by the Munros of Culrain. Duncan Munro of Culcairn had died at Boulogne in March 1821; as his only son George had predeceased him the Culcairn male line was extinguished. On 12 May 1835 Lord Ordinary ordered the Munro of Culrain case to be ordered to the First Division of the Court of Session. On 12 January 1836 the First Division found the case in favour of Mary being legitimate as did the Court on 15 November 1837. This judgment was appealed to the House of Lords, but in 1840 they reversed it on the grounds that Sir Hugh the father, never lost his Scottish domicile and so his marriage in England to the mother of Mary after her birth, was treated as if celebrated in Scotland where the marriage legalizes the birth of all children previously born out of wedlock. Death Sir Hugh Munro, 8th Baronet died in 1848 and his daughter Mary intended to take up her residence in Foulis Castle, but before she was able to do so she died unmarried on 12 January 1849 at her temporary residence in Perry Hill, Sydenham, county of Kent. She was interred at Norwood having only survived her father by 8 months. Sir Hugh had also had at least one more illegitimate child. As noted in Sir Hugh's willEdinburgh Sheriff Court Wills. SC70/4/5, George was his natural son by Isabella RossMackenzie. p. 154., born in 1791. His half-sister Mary had bequeathed to George her property of Milntown of Katewell and in his will George instructed that \\"the Mills of Catwell and Drummond and the Lands of Swordale\\" be sold and the funds used to found a school, to be called the Seymour Munro Free School, in Perth.Edinburgh Sheriff Court Wills. SC70/4/41 Mackenzie believed George had removed all of his grandfather Sir Harry's family papers and valuable manuscripts to his sister's residence in Perry Hill, Sydenham where they were destroyed. In fact, this series of legal documents concerning the Munro of Foulis family from the year 1299 to 1823 had been put into the hands of his solicitor Robert Jamieson. The missing manuscripts were \\"discovered\\" in the successor firm's Glasgow office in the 1930s and published as the Calendar Writs of Munro of Foulis Books clanmunro.org.uk.

The Foulis Writs have also shown Mackenzie not to be entirely accurate. George had a natural daughter, named Mary Seymour Munro after his sister (on marriage she became Mary Seymour Roberts). On his death in 1855, as instructed in his will, George was interred in the same tomb in West Norwood Cemetery as his beloved sister. Upon Mary Seymour Munro's death the estate and Baronetcy of Foulis passed to Sir Charles Munro, 7th of Culrain and 9th Baronet of Foulis.Mackenzie. p. 155.

Production is controlled by the CLE genes. Upon binding to a CLE peptide receptor in another cell, a chain reaction of events occurs, which can lead to various physiological and developmental processes. This signaling pathway is conserved in diverse land plants.  Background  Plants and animals alike both use small polypeptides for signaling in cell-to-cell communication. CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region-Related, also known as a plant peptide hormone, signaling is important for cell to cell signaling but also long distance communication. These two actions are especially important for plant cells because they are stationary and must perform cell expansion. In multicellular organisms cell-to-cell communication has been found to be very crucial for many growth processes that occur inside the organism. The 12 or 13 amino acid polypeptides are the mature forms of the CLE proteins that are derived from the conserved CLE domains. More and more CLE genes are being identified with more research being conducted in this area. CLE genes have not only been found in seed plants but also in lycophytes, bryophytes, and green algae.  Genes  Most research that has been conducted on CLE peptide signaling has been conducted with Arabidopsis, since this genome contains 32 members of the CLE gene family. CLV3 which belongs to the CLE family of genes is found within one or more tissues of Arabidopsis. All 32 members of the CLE family share two characteristics that include: encoding of a small protein with a putative secretion signal at their N- termini and contain a conserved CLE motif at or near their C-termini. The 32 members of the CLE gene family originated from mutations of the original gene.  Structures  CLE peptides are coded by the CLE genes. These peptides vary in structure with each peptide structure performing a different job with in the plant. The minimal length of functioning CLE peptides has been found to be 12 amino acids with several critical residues. There are two different peptide structures that are found within the plant and they are A-type and B-type. When A-type hormones are secreted the plant slows down the rate of root growth whereas the secretion of B-type peptides effects the vascular growth of the plant. The secretion of A-type peptides speeds up the vascular development of the plant that is mediated by the B-type peptides. This suggests that these two types of peptides work together to regulate the growth of the plant. The specific peptides are: A-type peptides * CLE 1/3/4 * CLE 2 * CLE 5/6 * CLE 7 * CLE 8 * CLE 9 * CLE 10 * CLE 11 * CLE 12 * CLE 13 * CLE 14 * CLE 16 * CLE 17 * CLE 18 * CLE 19 * CLE 20 * CLE 21 * CLE 22 * CLE 25 * CLE 26 * CLE 27 * CLE 40 * CLE 45 B-type peptides * CLE 41/44/TDIF * CLE 42 * CLE 43 * CLE 46  Signaling in the shoot apical meristem  Shoot apical meristems of Crassula ovata (left). Fourteen days later, leaves have developed (right). Tunica-Corpus model of the apical meristem (growing tip). The epidermal (L1) and subepidermal (L2) layers form the outer layers called the tunica. The inner L3 layer is called the corpus. Cells in the L1 and L2 layers divide in a sideways fashion, which keeps these layers distinct, whereas the L3 layer divides in a more random fashion. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of the plant and keep the plant growing. There are two types of meristematic tissues 1) Apical Meristem 2) Lateral Meristem. The Apical Meristem is of two types; the shoot apical meristem (SAM) gives rise to organs like the leaves and flowers, while the root apical meristem (RAM) provides the meristematic cells for the future root growth. SAM and RAM cells divide rapidly and are considered indeterminate, in that they do not possess any defined end status. In that sense, the meristematic cells are frequently compared to the stem cells in animals, which have an analogous behavior and function. Within plants SAM cells play a major role in the overall growth and development, this is due to the fact that all cells making up the major parts of the plant come from the shoot apical meristem (SAM). There are three different important area found within the SAM and they include the central zone, the peripheral zone), and the rib meristem. Each of these areas play an important in the production of new stem cells within the SAM. All SAMs are usually dome shaped and have structures that are layered and are described as the tunica and corpus. CLV3 plays an important role in regulating the production of stem cells within the Central Zone region of the (SAM), this is also true for the cell promoting WUSCHEL (WUS) gene. The combination of these two genes regulates stem cell production by WUS negatively or positively regulating the production of stem cells by controlling the CLV3 gene.; = Genes in other plants = CLE genes have been found in numerous monocots, dicots, and even moss. Research has even shown that some plants like rice contain the presence of a multi-CLE domain. Various CLE-like genes have also been found in the genomes of plant-parasitic nematodes such as beet, soybean and potato cyst nematodes.

Early life Elizabeth McCausland was born in Wichita, Kansas, on April 16, 1899. Career A few years after graduating from Smith College (Bachelor's degree in 1920 and Master's in 1922), she began working for Springfield Sunday Union and The Springfield Republican, both newspapers based in Springfield, Massachusetts. She became deeply invested in the Sacco-Vanzetti case and eventually compiled a series of articles in a pamphlet called The Blue Menace. She taught at Barnard College (1956), New School for Social Research (1946), Design Laboratory (1939) and Sarah Lawrence College (art history, 1942-1944). She worked in close cooperation with the photographer Berenice Abbott on the publication of her Changing New York series in 1939. The project was sponsored by the Federal Art Project and McCausland wrote the text that accompanied Abbott's photographs. Much of her interest in art scholarship was rooted in aspirations towards democracy and social justice. Starting from the mid-1930s, she worked as an art critic and freelance writer, contributing to Parnassus, The New Republic, and Magazine of Art. Writing primarily on Social Realist painting and photography, McCausland‚Äôs reaction to the art world‚Äôs turn to abstraction in the 1950s was grim, stating that she felt it ‚Äúto be the artist‚Äôs flight from reality and from responsibility.‚Äù Her feelings softened somewhat in later years, and she wrote that in her holistic commitment to the social aspects of art, she felt she had neglected her own emotional and poetic sides. McCausland wrote Work for Artists in 1947, which outlined the living conditions and economic status of the American artist.\\"Revolt, They Said\\". www.andreageyer.info. Retrieved 2017-08-17. She also authored works on individual artists, including Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, Edward Lamson Henry, Charles W. Hawthorne and George Inness. Other books include: Careers in the Arts, Fine and Applied (1950) and Art Professions in the United States. She also wrote poetry and designed limited edition publications which she printed on her private press. In 1939 McCausland organized the retrospective exhibition Lewis Hine at the Riverside Museum. Other exhibitions of which she was the organizer include The World of Today (Berkshire Museum, 1939), an exhibition of silk screen prints for the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts and New York State Museum (1940), and Photography Today (A.C.A. Gallery, 1944). In 1943, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities, US & Canada, for her study of \\"the status of the artist in America from colonial times to the present, with especial attention to the relation between art and patronage\\". In 1944 she was appointed on the Advisory Committee of the Department of Photography of the Museum of Modern Art. In 1950 she worked as a special consultant at the Corcoran Gallery for an American Processional exhibition and was editor of the accompanying book. McCausland's extensive research focused particularly on E. L. Henry, Lewis Hine, George Inness, and Alfred Maurer. She spent the last fifteen years of her life researching painter Marsden Hartley. Personal life Berenice Abbott, 1930s McCausland moved to New York City in 1935 and died there on May 14, 1965. Throughout this period she lived with her partner Berenice Abbott at 50 Commerce Street, Manhattan. After McCausland's death, Abbott moved to Maine where she died in 1991. McCausland is buried at Maple Grove Cemetery, Wichita. McCausland also corresponded with Arthur Dove and Alfred Stieglitz, the latter of whom was a close friend.

Form and purpose  \\"Les Djinns\\" is distinguished by its very original form, in \\"crescendo\\" and \\"decrescendo\\": the strophes have a different number of syllables, respectively 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and finally 2. This form resonates with the poem,Scrutiny of the stanza in The Cambridge Companion to Twentieth- Century English Poetry which is the account of the crash caused by the passage of a swarm of djinns around the narrator's house. The epic and mystical force of this poem makes it one of the bravest pieces of the collection.  Poem in verse  Les Djinns Murs, ville, Et port, Asile De mort, Mer grise O√π brise La brise, Tout dort. Dans la plaine Na√Æt un bruit. C'est l'haleine De la nuit. Elle brame Comme une √¢me Qu'une flamme Toujours suit! La voix plus haute Semble un grelot. D'un nain qui saute C'est le galop. Il fuit, s'√©lance, Puis en cadence Sur un pied danse Au bout d'un flot. La rumeur approche. L'√©cho la redit. C'est comme la cloche D'un couvent maudit ; Comme un bruit de foule, Qui tonne et qui roule, Et tant√¥t s'√©croule, Et tant√¥t grandit, Dieu ! la voix s√©pulcrale Des Djinns !... Quel bruit ils font ! Fuyons sous la spirale De l'escalier profond. D√©j√† s'√©teint ma lampe, Et l'ombre de la rampe, Qui le long du mur rampe, Monte jusqu'au plafond. C'est l'essaim des Djinns qui passe, Et tourbillonne en sifflant! Les ifs, que leur vol fracasse, Craquent comme un pin br√ªlant. Leur troupeau, lourd et rapide, Volant dans l'espace vide, Semble un nuage livide Qui porte un √©clair au flanc. Ils sont tout pr√®s ! - Tenons ferm√©e Cette salle, o√π nous les narguons. Quel bruit dehors ! Hideuse arm√©e De vampires et de dragons ! La poutre du toit descell√©e Ploie ainsi qu'une herbe mouill√©e, Et la vieille porte rouill√©e Tremble, √† d√©raciner ses gonds! Cris de l'enfer! voix qui hurle et qui pleure! L'horrible essaim, pouss√© par l'aquilon, Sans doute, √¥ ciel ! s'abat sur ma demeure. Le mur fl√©chit sous le noir bataillon. La maison crie et chancelle pench√©e, Et l'on dirait que, du sol arrach√©e, Ainsi qu'il chasse une feuille s√©ch√©e, Le vent la roule avec leur tourbillon! Proph√®te ! si ta main me sauve De ces impurs d√©mons des soirs, J'irai prosterner mon front chauve Devant tes sacr√©s encensoirs! Fais que sur ces portes fid√®les Meure leur souffle d'√©tincelles, Et qu'en vain l'ongle de leurs ailes Grince et crie √† ces vitraux noirs! Ils sont pass√©s ! - Leur cohorte S'envole, et fuit, et leurs pieds Cessent de battre ma porte De leurs coups multipli√©s. L'air est plein d'un bruit de cha√Ænes, Et dans les for√™ts prochaines Frissonnent tous les grands ch√™nes, Sous leur vol de feu pli√©s! De leurs ailes lointaines Le battement d√©cro√Æt, Si confus dans les plaines, Si faible, que l'on croit Ou√Ør la sauterelle Crier d'une voix gr√™le, Ou p√©tiller la gr√™le Sur le plomb d'un vieux toit. D'√©tranges syllabes Nous viennent encor ; Ainsi, des arabes Quand sonne le cor, Un chant sur la gr√®ve Par instants s'√©l√®ve, Et l'enfant qui r√™ve Fait des r√™ves d'or. Les Djinns fun√®bres, Fils du tr√©pas, Dans les t√©n√®bres Pressent leurs pas; Leur essaim gronde: Ainsi, profonde, Murmure une onde Qu'on ne voit pas. Ce bruit vague Qui s'endort, C'est la vague Sur le bord; C'est la plainte, Presque √©teinte, D'une sainte Pour un mort. On doute La nuit...

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History Centreville was first established as the county seat of St. Joseph County in 1831. The first county offices were located in a leased house. In 1841, Thomas W. Langley, donated land to the county on which to construct a courthouse and a jail, and the first county courthouse was completed the following year. In 1859, two additional office buildings were constructed. However, by the 1890s, the county buildings were becoming dilapidated, and by 1897, the need to repair or replace them had become critical. At first, the county board of supervisors adopted plans to renovate the existing courthouse, but county voters rejected the proposal. In 1899, the board adopted a plan to replace the courthouse, which was approved by voters alter that year. (note: large pdf file) A building committee was formed, and the committee selected architect Sidney J. Osgood of Grand Rapids to design this building. Ionia contractors David C Crookshank and William H. Somers were selected to construct the building. The cornerstone of the new courthouse was laid on September 7, 1899. The construction of the courthouse was completed by August 1900, at a total cost of $34,418.90. The building served to house the local courts until the 1970s, when a new two-story building was constructed south of the old courthouse. The building is still used by the county government. Description The Saint Joseph County Courthouse is a rectangular, three-story, Richardsonian Romanesque building, constructed of red brick with sandstone trim. The lower level is slightly below grade, and is faced with rock. The building has a hip and gable roof, and a square plan, pyramidal-roofed, arcaded center tower rises to 45 feet in height. The main entrances are to the north and east; these entrances display round-arch stone detailing topped by keystones. A glass-enclosed passageway to the south of the courthouse connects to the Courts Building. On the interior, each floor is laid out in a T pattern, with the principal staircases located near the two entrances.

Several religious buildings were built before the present cathedral building, but were erected with materials too fragile and none resisted for a long time. It was in 1736 that the last of them was declared out of commission, and the construction of the work we know today took place. Without an exact date, it is believed that the present building was consecrated and opened between 1761 and 1765. Since then there have been minor modifications in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was in this cathedral that the new Argentine flag, created by Manuel Belgrano, was blessed on May 25, 1812.

The Goodbye Family comprises Pyridine Goodbye, matriarch and mortician, Otis, father and driver of the hearse, their child Orphie, who has the dual role of gravedigger and self-appointed town Sheriff, and their pets: Ouiji the cat, a tarantula named Dorian, and Midnight their horse. Since 2009, the Goodbyes have appeared in both single panel comic and literature as part of the Great Mountain book series by Richards that begin with Me‚Äôma and the Great Mountain. The humor of the Goodbye Family is typically gothic or macabre,The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards ‚Äì Alextheshadowgirl's Blog and often satirizing industrialization and rules of authority. Characters and story Beginning in 2009, Richards started to produce the Goodbye Family as one-off cards after an inspiring trip to France and Wales. Richards envisioned Orphie, the daughter, and primary character, on the roof of the Notre Dame Cathedral sitting with gargoyles, while her parents Otis tried to board a train with a shrunken head, and Pyridine publicly sewed a cadaver in Cardiff. Subsequent single panel comics and merchandise were made of each character but before delving further into their identities. In 2012, A Raven Above Press released Richards first novel Me‚Äôma and the Great Mountain, about an indigenous girl that overcomes ghoulish spirits to save her people. Along with her journey, she meets Hollis Sorrow, a friendly character entombed in a casket made by the Goodbye Family, marking the first mention in literature of the Goodbye Family. By 2015, Steamkat, an online comic distributor, weekly featured The Goodbye Family comic, and starting in the following year, Richards released subsequent book collections about the family and syndicated his series through social media and Tapas. The Goodbye family lives in a giant tree that has been made habitable by Otis' woodworking. Their original house was lost in a fire due to the war of the Tried and Boorish. * Orphie: Daughter who loves mischief and has the strength of 20 men ‚Äì which comes in handy when carrying caskets and as a gravedigger. She finds herself most often filling in as sheriff of the town and training her pet spider Dorian. * Otis: Driver of their funeral hearse with an uncanny ability to smell demise a mile away. He is in charge of all the wakes. He spends his free time walking his hat and feeding their horse Midnight various pickled things. * Pyridine: Matriarch and mortician of the family. She enjoys needling cadavers and social gatherings with the undead. * Ouiji: the family cat. Believed to be part Siamese due to her glowing red eyes. * Dorian: Orphie‚Äôs pet tarantula (specifically a Needlepoint Tarantula) that loves to spin webbed accessories for the family. * Midnight: Most likely a Friesian horse, she is the Goodbye's main implement of travel for both single rider and carriage. She characteristically is fueled by pickled things. * Kepla: a mysterious older brother of Orphie that happens to be somehow older than her parents. * Lassie: a deadly snake that was introduced in the 2019 comics that assists Orphie like a lasso in catching villains. In an interview, when asked about the characters influences Richards replied: \\"I suppose Pyridine Goodbye, the matriarch, is loosely based on my wife, Otis Goodbye is myself, and Orphie their child is Berlin (Richards daughter) and our friend's child Heidi (who came before our daughter). All though with a few other influences. Just like the Goodbye Family we do have a pet tarantula and Siamese cat.\\" Kepla is said to be based on an older friend of Richards and his wife that they jokingly called their son.https://www.patreon.com/posts/patreon-with-34254480 Humor Richards clarifies the genre of The Goodbye Family: \\"I fall into the category of Weird West, but I think it may be more of a ‚ÄúDown West‚Äù as I‚Äôd like to call it, for its sense of macabre western humor.\\" The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain is a Weird West juvenile fiction novel by Lorin Morgan- Richards,https://www.nfreads.com/interview-with-author-lorin-morgan- richards/The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards - FictionDB the second in his Great Mountain series, about undertakers Otis, Pyridine, and their daughter Orphie.The Goodbye Family and The Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards Review ‚Äì Author Anthony Avina's Blog According to the book's summary Pyridine is a witch and mortician, Otis is a bumbling but brazen hearse driver, and Orphie has the strength of twenty men and helps with grave digging.Lorin Morgan-Richards - Goodbye Family and the Great MountainThe Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards - HeyitsCarlyRae Following the first novel Me‚Äôma and the Great Mountain, Me‚Äôma, an Indigenous child, has routed the mining tycoon Baron Von Nickle and headed west over the Great Mountain as the defeated and leaderless miners returned east to the town of Nicklesworth. Frank Thorne is the only soldier to stay intact and searches for the Baron's accomplice. The Goodbye family, undertakers in town, hear of the defeat when the Baron's rattail hair appear on their doorstep. The Goodbye's, suffering from poor business, look to monetize the situation and seek an heir, but find the townsfolk are turning into zombies. Otis finds the culprit in a new tonic that leads the family to Nothom, the underworld, where Thorne is following close behind. They find a production facility that is pumping oil to those above for consumption, dramatically altering the land of Nothom to the dissatisfaction of the Goodbyes. In turn, and without the Baron, the oil is causing the townspeople above, like Thorne, to become the living dead and fall under the control of the Baron's accomplice, a wicked warlock named Zenwick Aldrich.Introducing the Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain by Lorin Morgan-Richards - YouTube The book is a blend of goth and humor and stylistically has been compared to author's like Roald Dahl.https://www.thefaeriereview.com/2020/04/check-it-out- goodbye-family.html#more The story includes a foreword by medium Richard-Lael Lillard.Amazon.com: The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain (9781733287913): Lorin Morgan-Richards, Jessica Rose Felix, Richard-Lael Lillard: Books A common theme in Richards stories is an underlying environmental message.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), refugees are displaced persons who, \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" In order to gain refugee status in Canada, an individual must demonstrate that they are at risk of being persecuted and unable to seek protection from their home country. These claims can be made once the individual resides in Canada on a visa or prior to their arrival. Much of the research on this population tends to be qualitative in character and is carried out with asylum seekers who already reside in Canada.  History of LGBT and GSM refugees in Canada  Throughout the 20th century, homosexuality was considered by some to be deviant behaviour and participants were considered a \\"‚Äòbad‚Äô citizen.\\" It was a criminalized lifestyle in North American discourses of American nationalism and citizenship. In 1991, Canada became one of the first Western nations to grant refugee status due to persecution based on sexual orientation. In 1993, during Canada (A.G.) v. Ward, the parameters of \\"belonging to a specific social group\\" were defined to explicitly accept LGBT/GSM refugees. By 1995, Canada offered adjudicator training regarding sexual minorities in different countries. While media attention for the LGBT/GSM refugee has increased, quantifying the numbers of incoming LGBT/GSM refugee cases is difficult due to access to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) statistics and changing standards of measurement. In 2002, The Globe and Mail reported that between 1999 and 2004, almost 2,500 GSM/LGBT asylum seekers made claims based on sexual or gender orientation. These claims included 75 different countries. According to Sean Rehagg in 2004, 1,358 LGBT/GSM claims were adjudicated, or decided in 2004. Statistics between April 2009 and June 2011 show that \\"561 refugee claims based on sexual orientation were finalized before the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, with 58 per cent of those claims being granted refugee protection.\\"  LGBT and GSM experience in Canada as a refugee or asylum seeker  = Process of applying for refugee status = The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (aka the 1951 Refugee Convention) is the United Nations treaty that defines who is a refugee, setting out the rights and guidelines for those who are granted refugee status and the responsibilities of the nation that grants it. The 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees is the following treaty that removes the temporal and geographical restrictions of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Canada is party to both treaties. To apply for refugee status, the asylum seeker must first establish a well founded fear of persecution and be unable to obtain protection from their country of nationality. The persecution must be due to reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Persecution, according to LaVolette (2014), is defined as \\"harm feared [to] be serious and that it be inflicted in a persistent, repetitive or systematic way.\\" David Murray explains that documentation is the \\"foundation of a refugee claim.\\" Documents are generated, reviewed, and assessed by members of the IRB to determine if the asylum seeker meets the criteria of \\"refugee\\" outlined in the 1951 Convention, the 1967 Protocol, and the Canadian Government‚Äôs policy. A refugee claim can be made at a port of entry or at an inland office. The first step in applying for refugee status is the \\"Personal Information Form\\" that explains why the refugee is applying for asylum and creates the foundation of the refugee case file. Once the case has been started, the refugee applicant is expected to supply RPD documents evidencing who they are (including their name and date of birth), and documents that may support their claim for sanctuary, including proof of membership, medical reports, visas, etc. If the documentation is in a language other than English or French, the applicant must have them translated into either English or French. Once all the documentation is filed, the next step the applicant undergoes is the hearing, where a member of the RPD will decide whether or not the case meets the standard for refugee. The applicant may have representation at the hearing. If the applicant chooses to have counsel, they are responsible for the fee. The refugee applicant is not required to have counsel. If the applicant does not speak English or French, the RPD will provide an interpreter at no cost. After the hearing, the claim will be accepted or rejected. For rejections, most of the time applicants can appeal the Refugee Appeal Division or file for a leave and for judicial review with the Federal Court. The refugee cannot appeal if they meet specific criteria i.e. if they are designated foreign national, or the \\"RPD‚Äôs decision says that the claim has no credible basis or is manifestly unfounded.\\" = Pre-migration experience = Research regarding the pre- migration experience is limited. In a study done by Edwards J. Alessi, Sarilee Kahn, and Der Horn Van in 2017, discovered 4 themes of coping strategies during the pre-migration experience narrative: \\"‚Äòliving on the edge,\\" adopting concealment strategies, routine victimization, and protectors as perpetrators.\\" The authors determined these themes through the study of 26 pre-migration narrative interviews. They argue that homophobia and transphobia can be so entrenched in societal structures that individuals are unable to seek help when facing violence or threats from their local law enforcement. This study also found that refugees‚Äô pre-migration narratives tended to have similar experiences. Refugees often described their protectors as perpetrators, and applicants underwent routine victimization. To deal with the victimization experiences, refugees develop similar strategies across multiple nationalities and cultures. = The refugee narrative and identity = The refugee process takes a toll on refugee identity and relations. The refugee process enforces a refugee narrative upon the refugee. The process of gaining refugee status in Canada requires that the refugee prove their sexual orientation in accordance with the expectation on how a LGBT and GSM refugee should behave in the Western world. These social and political pressures on GSM and LGBT refugees leads to the construction of identity that is congruent with the Western coming out narrative, which emphasize a chronological and binary recognition of one‚Äôs own sexual identity. Current research indicates a homonationalistic stance of the Canadian government towards LGBT and sexual minority refugees and asylum seekers. Homonationalism refers to Jasbir Paur's 2007 concept of \\"a privileged relationship between post-9/11 American nationalism and a particular raced, classed, and gendered formation of gay identity in opposition to the threat of racialized others.\\" This has led to criticism that the Canadian society and government have a specific idea on what it is to be \\"gay\\". Researchers, such as David A. B. Murray, argue that this homonationalistic stance lends itself to refugees being required to adopt a culturally recognizable performance in order to obtain refugee status. Megan Gaucher and Alexa DeGagne argue the narrative that the Canadian government supports places Canada in the role of protector and refugees‚Äô home nation in the role of uncivilized country. This can cause stress to the refugee because it encourages them to embrace Canada as the saviour from the uncivilized home nation. Researchers argue that casting Canada as a protector leads to the idea that the refugee should be grateful, and happy to be in Canada. Expecting the refugee to accept the home nation‚Äôs uncivilized role can negatively impact refugees‚Äô psychological health as well as inhibit the reports of the structural violence refugees encounter during the determination process in order to fit into the role of a grateful refugee. Current research also indicates a need for a more flexible understanding of sexual narratives and sexual minority groups. The research further suggests that the understanding of GSM and LGBT refugee experience still comes from a binary and linear understanding of how to be GSM and LGBT that has encompassed the Western idea of what it means to be \\"gay\\" in Canada. The Western understanding of the GSM and LGBT experience has been focused on a chronological recognition where the individual discovers that they are LGBT and the performance of that identity then remains constant in a chronological fashion. David A. B. Murray argues that this is often exhibited through chronological questions. The progress of recognizing one‚Äôs ideas begins in childhood and background, then sexual experiences and desires during adolescence and adulthood prior to their migration. This LGBT identity favours the binary approach of being male or female, and attracted to males or females. The refugee narrative expected by the government of the refugee experience is taught and absorbed to the incoming refugees to increase their chances of success in navigating the refugee process. Many applicants join social groups in efforts to increase their authenticity of their identity during the application process to visibly demonstrate their sexual identity and to help deal with the stress of the process. The process for the refugee application and gaining refugee status is the same for all LGBT refugees and through sharing their experiences it can increase their chances for success. This can cause suspicion among other applicants as their stories can sound similar. The Western narrative emphasizes the linear process of discovering the refugee‚Äôs sexual identity, where their background and childhood experiences leads to the recognition during adolescence and adulthood. It is expected by officials that friends and family would be familiar with the individuals sexual orientation‚Äîduring the process, friends and family can be contacted to authenticate their preferences. In some cases, when friend and family are not familiar with the individual's orientation, it can increase the risk of the refugee request being denied. = Applying as a bisexual refugee or asylum seeker = According to researchers like Sean Rehagg, the homonationalistic understanding of the LGBT/GSM experience seems to be binary and unchangeable in nature. For a bisexual refugee, there is a greater risk of being turned down than those who identify as gay, lesbian or transsexual. Rehagg argues that the bisexual refugee experience can be looked at in two ways: They are invisible in their home state and they have low success rates. According to Rehagg, the threat of bisexuality to both the heterosexual and homosexual binary understanding of sexuality can lead to the bisexual refugee receiving less attention than the LGBT community, as it threatens the stance of having a single preference supported by both the homosexual and heterosexual beliefs. The support of binary sexual preference and identification is attributed to the cis-normative and hetero-normative approaches to sexuality that are entrenched in the social system in Canada. Despite the first publicly recorded bisexual refugee case in Canada in 2000, the number of bisexual refugees has decreased over the last twenty years. In a recent study done by Rehagg, no bisexual refugee was granted refugee status between 2001 and 2004. Furthermore, out of the 115 publicly published LGBT/GSM applicants, only 11 identified as bisexual. Rehagg also found that bisexual applicants made up 7% of the claims, and the success rate of bisexual applicants was 25%. LGBT/GSM applicants that identified other than bisexual had a 49% success rate, and the average success rate was found to be 46%.

Bernays (1856 ‚Äì January 30, 1931) was an American author, journalist, artist, art collector, speaker, and suffragette. Early life and family Bernays was born in Highland, Illinois, in 1856, the second child of Dr. George J. Bernays (d. 1888) and Minna Bertrand. She was the granddaughter of Clemens Bernays, and great-granddaughter of Jacob Gera Bernays. The Bernays family has many cultural ties in history. Thekla's mother was the daughter of Frederick Doering, of Germany, and granddaughter of Seris Bertrand, of France. Her parents met in Germany but married in St. Louis at the residence of Henry Boernstein, well known theatrical manager and head of a newspaper at that time. Her brother was Dr. Augustus Charles Bernays (1854‚Äì1907), a St. Louis surgeon. Bernays would later publish her brother's memoir in 1912. When Bernays was young, the family moved back to Germany for a time before moving back to the United States, landing in St. Louis. They would eventually settle in Lebanon, Illinois, in 1866. Bernays and her brother both attended McKendree College, located in Lebanon. Bernays was twice elected at president of one of the college's literary societies, the Clionian, and ranked high as an essayist. Soon after Bernay's brother's graduation from McKendree College in 1872, the family returned to Germany. For the next five years, they made their home in Heidelberg. Bernays' studies continued in a school for the higher education of women, since women were not admitted to university. In May 1874, a state examination for teachers was held at Karlsruhe, the capital of Grand Duchy of Baden. Bernays, then scarcely eighteen years old, received the highest grade given at the examination. The family returned to America in the spring of 1877. In November 1888, Bernays' father died of blood poisoning, which was contracted during an operation. In 1902, Bernays was awarded an honorary degree of Master of Arts from McKendree College for \\"meritorious work in the criticism of art and modern literature\\". At the time, she was the third woman at the college to receive that honor. Career Bernays was a foreign correspondent for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and contributed to Reedy's Mirror, the Westliche Post, The Criterion, and other publications. As a speaker and lecturer, Bernays delivered addresses and read papers before many societies and clubs, including the Young Men's Self-Culture Club, a similar organization for working girls, the St. Louis Negro Self-Culture Association, the Wednesday Club, the Greek Ethics Society, and the Century Club. One of the papers read was printed as a Christmas souvenir, Diplomatic Women; an Essay Read Before the Century Club of St. Louis, Mo., by Miss Thekla M. Bernays. An address delivered before the St. Louis Wednesday Club on \\"Postulating an American Literature,\\" and which was printed in the \\"Bulletin\\" of Washington University, attracted much attention. St. Louis Artist's Guild building Bernays was a charter member of the St. Louis Artists Guild. The building at 812 Union Boulevard was designed by her nephew Louis C. Spiering, perhaps due to her recommendation. She was also a member of the Arts & Crafts jury for the St. Louis World's Fair or Louisiana Purchase Exposition. In December 1911, Bernays wrote a decalogue for women: # equal facilities in education # equal rights in the guardianship of children # equal wages for equal work # a single standard of morality # regulation and restraint of child labor # abolition of sweatshops # abolition of firetrap factories # suppression of smoke # minimizing the drink evil without interfering with personal liberty # abolition of white slave traffic. Other activities The Adoration of the Shepherds, Follower of Leandro Bassano; Bernays gave this to the Brooklyn Museum. Bernays was a member of an artists group active from 1890 to 1910, which included Zoe Akins, Sara Teasdale, Orrick Glenday Johns, and William Marion Reedy. Reedy said of Bernays that she had the greatest woman's mind he had ever known. He found her both wise and innocent, discerning and gentle. It was Reedy who introduced Bernays to Akins, and the two women became lifelong friends. Bernays corresponded with notable American literary figures including Gertrude Atherton, Albert Bloch, Daniel Frohman, Frank Harris, Mitchell Kennerley, and George O'Neil. Bernays was an art collector. She owned Leandro Bassano's version of The Adoration of the Shepherds, which she would eventually gift to the Brooklyn Museum; the museum sold it in 2013 through Sotheby's, attributing it to a \\"follower of\\" Bassano. Personal life In 1897, Thekla adopted her nephew, Eric Simons Bernays (1884‚Äì1935), son of her sister Lily Bernays and Frederick Simons. In 1885, Eric Simons was the subject of a custody battle between his father, Simons, his mother Lily, and Lily and Thekla's father, George Bernays. In the late 1890s, Thekla moved with Eric to Switzerland where he attended the Ecole de Commerce at Neufch√¢tel. They returned to St. Louis around 1902 and lived in the Bernays \\"compound\\". Eric was struck by an automobile while crossing a street and died of his injuries in 1935. Bernays died January 30, 1931, in New York, and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Legacy The Thekla M. Bernays Papers, 1870‚Äì1931, are housed at the Missouri History Museum archives. The Thekla M. Bernays Scholarship is awarded by the Art Students League of New York.

The date stone above the rose window reads \\"Darby Library. 1743 1872\\" Darby Free Library is a public library at 1001 Main Street in Darby Borough, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Founded as the Darby Library Company in 1743 - just 12 years after Benjamin Franklin organized the Library Company of Philadelphia - it remains one of the oldest libraries in the United States. Although it was a subscription library until 1898, it claims to be \\"the oldest library in the United States in continuous service.\\" The library is celebrating its 275th anniversary in 2018. History Library on a c. 1905 postcard =Founding= The library was organized on March 10, 1743 by 29 Quakers as a subscription library. Joseph Bonsall was elected Secretary, Nathan Gibson, Treasurer, and John Pearson was the first Librarian. Until 1872 library meetings were held in member's houses and the librarian kept the collection of books in a trunk. Each subscriber pledged 20 shillings to join plus 5 shillings per year to continue his membership. ¬£11-10s Sterling was used to buy the first books from England. With the help of botanists John Bartram (in America) and Peter Collinson (in England), who performed similar services for the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first books arrived from England on November 5, 1743, These books included: *1 Vol. 1738 The Gentleman Instructed *1 Vol. 1729 Puffendorf‚Äôs Of the Law of Nature and Nations *8 Vol. 1736 * The Universal Spectator *8 Vol. 1741 The Turkish Spy *2 Vol. 1718 Tourneforte‚Äôs- A Voyage into the Levant *1 Vol. 1737 Whiston‚Äôs- A New Theory of the Earth *1 Vol. 1736 Addison‚Äôs Travels *1 Vol. 1736 Barclay‚Äôs Apology *1 Vol. 1738 Locke- Some Thoughts Concerning Education *1 Vol. 1738 Religion of Nature Delineated *1 Vol. 1741 Gordan‚Äôs Geographical Grammar *1 Vol. 1743 Sherlock- A Practical Discourse Concerning Death *1 Vol. 1717 Whiston- Astronomical Principles of Religion *1 Vol. 1740 Maundrel- A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem *1 Vol. 1740 Dycke‚Äôs New English Dictionary *1 Vol. 1733 Tull- The Horse-Hoing Husbandry *1 Vol. 1736 Blackmore- Creation, a Philosophical Poem *3 Vol. 1735 The Independent Whig *1 Vol. 1738 Wood‚Äôs Institute of the Laws of England *2 Vol. 1730 Milton‚Äôs Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained *2 Vol. 1702 Puffendorf- The compleat History of Sweden *2 Vol. 1736 Raleigh- The History of the World *2 Vol. 1743 Lediard- The Life of the Duke of Marlborough Most of these books are still owned by the library and are on display there.These books will be on display at the Library Company of Philadelphia in early 2018 The library continued to buy books from London until 1761 when they began buying books from David Hall, a Philadelphia bookseller and publisher. By 1761 the collection included 230 volumes. =After the Revolution= View from the south An attempt was made in 1795 to purchase land a build a library building, but no property meeting the library's needs could be found at an affordable price. In 1819 Ann Paschall inherited a share in the library and became the first woman to be a member. She was not invited to the membership meetings however as the minutes state \\"her attendance at our meetings is dispensed with.\\" In 1826 borrowing privileges were extended to anyone paying a $3 annual fee. Several books were sold from the collection soon after. One book, The Pupil of Pleasure that offended Quaker sensibilities, was burned. In 1866 property was bought to build a permanent home for the library, just south of the Darby Friends Meetinghouse at the corner of 10th and Main Streets. The building was designed in the Italianate style by Benjamin D. Price and constructed by Charles Bonsall. It was completed in 1872 at a cost of $8,895.54. Price was known for designing churches and the library design in many ways resembles a church. In 1898 the library became free and open to the public.Mirror mirror on the wall, who‚Äôs the OLDEST of them all‚Ä¶?, Sturgis Library See also * List of public libraries in Delaware County, Pennsylvania References Further reading  Darby Library Company records, 1743-2012, finding aid prepared by Celia Caust-Ellenbogen and Sarah Leu. * Darby Free Library, A National Treasure, slideshow External links *Official website *Delaware County Libraries website Category:Delaware County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Darby Free Library"},{"id":"54940689","title":"Science Fiction (Brand New album)"},{"id":"54940721","text":"Sodian Gujar (Urdu: ÿ≥Ÿà⁄à€å ⁄Øÿ¨ÿ±) is a village, union council, and administrative subdivision of Jhelum District, in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.

The central hall is five rooms across, with a hill-shaped roof. The entire building is made from a very expensive and rare type of local cedar wood. Consort Duan's burial In 2013, archaeologists observed that a stone archway near to Zhaosi Hall was built in the style of an imperial memorial, but lacked an inscription. Local people reported that there had been a grave tumulus near the arch that had been levelled, suggesting that the individual buried there was the recipient of an imperial, uninscribed memorial. Additionally, the word cedar () in the original name Xiangnan ting sounds similar to the word for daughter in the local dialect (). Consequently, the archway is popularly believed to have been erected by Cao Ji in memory of his daughter.

True homologs of integrins exist in mammals, invertebrates, and some fungi but not in plant cells. Mammalian integrins are heterodimer transmembrane proteins that play a large role bidirectional signal transduction. As transmembrane proteins, integrins connect the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the plasma membrane of the animal cell. The extracellular matrix of plant cells, fungi, and some protist is referred to as the cell wall. The plant cell wall is composed of a tough cellulose polysaccharide rather than the collagen fibers of the animal ECM. Even with these differences, research indicates that similar proteins involved in the interaction between the ECM and animals cells are also involved in the interaction of the cell wall and plant cells. Integrin-like receptors and integrin-linked kinases together have been implicated in surface adhesion, immune response, and ion accumulation in plant cells in a manner akin to the family of integrin proteins.  Structure  ILRs contain a transmembrane region with a large extracellular portion and a smaller intracellular section. Most commonly, ILRs resembles the Œ≤1 subunit found in integrin proteins. This structural similarity between ILRs and integrins was determined through various imaging techniques, SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and kinetic studies. These proteins are around 55 to 110 kDa and some studies have found them to react with animal anti-Œ≤1 antibodies suggesting the structural similarity between animal integrins and these plant integrin-like receptors. Some ILRs mimic the Œ±-subunit of integrin proteins containing the ligand binding region known as the I-domain. The I-domain functions primarily in the recognition and binding of a ligand. Conformational changes in the I-domain leads to ILR activation and is dependent on metal ion interaction at metal-ion-dependent adhesion sites (MIDAS). Activation of these sites occur in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+. The extracellular domain of most ILRs contain the highly conserved tripepetid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). This sequence is commonly found in integrins and other molecules that attach to the extracellular matrix for cell adhesion. The discovery of the RGD sequence in many proteins suggest the same adhesive ability. While the RGD sequence is the most common, some ILRs have been found with sequences that are similar but differ in one amino acid. A plant protein with structural similarity to integrins contains the amino acid sequence Asn-Gly-Asp (NGD).  Function  = Plants = ILRs play a role in protein-protein interaction and are found in the plasma membrane of plant cells in the leaf, root and vasculature of plants. Plants produce a physiological response that is dependent on information obtained from the environment. The majority of this information is received through mechanical signals which include touch, sound, and gravity. Therefore, the interaction between the ECM and the internal cell response is incredibly important for receiving and interpreting information. The specific functionality of ILRs in plants is not well characterized but in addition to mechanical signaling transduction, they are believed to have some role in plant immune response, osmotic stress sensitivity, and ion regulation within the cell.  Surface- Adhesion  Some Œ≤1 integrin-like receptors on the root caps of Tabaco plants are found to play a role in the plant‚Äôs ability to detect gravitational pull and aid in root elongation in a process known as gravitropism. ILRs are found on the cellular membrane of plant protoplasts. The dispersion of the ILRs on these protoplasts can vary from species to species. The variation in the ILR surface placement has been correlated to species growth behavior. For example, Rubus fruticosus cells have a uniformed distribution of ILRs on their cellular membrane while Arabidopsis thaliana contains ILRs that cluster resulting in cell growth clusters.  Immunology  Integrin-like receptors have the capability to relay messages from inside the cell to the outside of the cell and vice versa. This is an important factor in the initiation and sustaining of an immunological response. A good body of research has found ILR proteins that model the glycoproteins vitronectin and fibronectin, two important molecules in membrane stability and homeostasis. These virtonectin-like and fibronectin-like protein provide further support that compounds in the cell membrane of plant cells have important regulatory functions in the immune response such as the activation of immune cells. The non-race specific disease resistance-1 (NDR1) primarily discovered to have a large function in plant immune response. This protein shares functional homology with mammalian integrins in that it connects the ECM to the intracellular matrix to both stabilize the cell structure and allow for signal exchange. NDR1 is also believed to be involved in cell wall adhesion to the plasma membrane and fluid retention of the cell. = Fungi = In addition to adhesive properties, integrin-like receptors with RGD-binding sites have special functions in fungi. Using peptides that inhibit the activity of proteins with RGD activation, ILR were discovered in Magnaporthe oryzae to initiate fungal conidial adhesion and appressorium formation needed for host infection. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungi with an integrin-like receptor protein known as Œ±Int1p. This protein maintains structural similarity and sequence homology to the Œ±-subunits of human leukocyte integrins. The Œ±Int1p protein contains an RGD extracellular binding site and allows the organism to attach to epithelial cells in the host organism to begin the infection process. Once bound, the protein then assists in the morphogenesis of the fungi into a tube-like structure. = Invertebrates = In invertebrates, protein structures with the RGD-binding sequence assist in an array of different functions such as the repairing of wounds and cell adhesion. Integrin-like receptors are found in mollusk and have a part in the spreading of hemocytes to damaged locations in the cellular system. Studies that block the RGD-binding site of these integrin-like receptors indicate a reduction in hemocyte aggregation and spreading suggesting the RGD-binding site on integrin-like receptors is a necessary component in organismal immune response. Further support for this calm shows RGD-binding inhibition reduces nodule formation and encapsulation in invertebrate immune response.

Attractions Zainager Canal in Onagam Bandipora WaterFalls and Zainager Canal: Zainager is the name of a pgn. between the Wular lake and the Pohru river developed by Zain-ul-Abidin (1420-1470 A.D.) by raising a dam of boulders across the Pohru to provide water for irrigation in the tract. Zain- ul-Abdin constructed the Zainager Canal and started building places, the chaks, who appear to have remained untamed so far. The purpose of constructing Nehr-e-Zainager (Zainager Canal) was to irrigate Zainager, it originates from Sonarwani, and flows through Watrina, Panjigam, Onagam, Potushai and so on... and finally reaches to Zainager (village). It moves in loops till it enters Sopore irrigating about 13300 acres of land. It is 47 km long, takes its water from the river Madhumati. Panchakki(Grutt- Kashmiri), also known as the water mill, is used to grind grain. The water mill is kept fed with sufficient water, the arrangement is such that the water is made to fall into the Chakki river's cistern from quite a height in order to generate the necessary power to drive the mill. Onagam's Panchakki is located near the twin waterfalls. The main water resource to this chakki is Nehr Zainagair (Badshal Canal). A few gallons of water are allowed to flow through a small stream towards the panchakki, and once the purpose of running the grinder is served, water is allowed to flow back into Badshah Canal. Onagam's Grutt keeps serving people from distant areas almost throughout the year. Except for Nov, Dec, and January. it keeps running throughout the year.

It was later demolished in stages to make way for the Louvre Palace. Its main location was on the right bank of the Seine river.  The fortress  Map of the Louvre castle under Charles V (reigned 1364‚Äì1380) as reconstructed in 1856. The map is inverted with the South (and Seine river) at the top of the image. The Louvre in 1380 (under Charles V) as imagined in 1885. Plan from around 1880 of the Louvre castle in 1380 after the construction of the Charles V wall. Before his departure for the Third Crusade in 1190, King Philip II wanted to protect Paris, the capital of his Kingdom, against invasions. In particular, he wanted to defend Paris against English soldiers based in Normandy. Additionally and more specifically, King Phillip II wanted to build a place to keep his treasure and his archives safe. These archives were especially sacred to the King because they were lost during the Battle of Fr√©teval in 1194 against Richard the Lionheart, but he had since reconstructed and did not want to lose again. He built the enclosure, which bears his name, around Paris between 1190 and 1209 for the right bank portion and between 1200 and 1215 for the left bank which was less exposed. The Louvre castle stands west, the most exposed side, as English soldiers were occupying Normandy less than 100 km away. This decision was also motivated by a previous Viking invasion in 845 that almost captured the city. The castle itself is composed of a squared fortress (78 m by 72 m), surrounded by a 10 m wide moat fed by the water of the nearby Seine river. The wall on the west side, which overlooks the countryside, is thicker and doorless when compared to the other walls, as it was appraised to be the most exposed side, and therefore the most vulnerable for an attack. The perimeter is reinforced by ten defensive towers, with extra emphasis on the corners of the castle. The space between towers never exceeds 25 m, which is the distance corresponding to the effective range of a bow (of that time). They are pierced with arrowslits to defend the ramparts. The castle has two entrances with the main one facing south and the Seine, while a secondary smaller one faces east and the city. These doors are protected by drawbridges and are framed between two twin towers. Two additional buildings housing the garrisons and the arsenals are located outside of the surrounding wall, to the west and south of the central courtyard, respectively. The set of curtains and walls are at a slight downward angle to hamper sapping attempts and to facilitate the rebound of projectiles thrown from the top against attacking soldiers. A keep named the Grosse Tour (Big Tower in French) was built in 1200 in the center of the courtyard. It is a circular keep with a diameter of 15.6 m and is enclosed by a 30 m tall wall that is 4.25 m thick at its base. It is surrounded by a 9 m wide ditch that is 6 m deep. This ditch is dry (i.e. not flooded) and paved with large irregular stones. It is crossed by a drawbridge. The interior arch was built in stone to limit the risk of fire. The keep has a conical roof slate over the machicolation. It features a well and a large tank for supporting long sieges, as well as a chapel. Philippe Auguste chose a round keep, instead of a squared or rectangular one, for military reasons. The reason being, enemy pioneers could more easily sap the wall at the angles of squared towers compared to circular towers, a smart tactic on the part of Auguste. The keep initially had a military function as the refuge of the king. However, it essentially housed the royal treasure and archives, at least until Philippe le Bel. It was also used as a prison until the 14th century. Notable prisoners included Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, who was defeated and captured at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 and then spent thirteen years imprisoned in this dungeon. This castle is a typical example of .  Royal residence  The castle in the 15th century as illustrated in the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry Under the orders of Louis IX of France, the castle was enlarged and new rooms were built without any real defensive purpose, an example would be the Salle Saint-Louis (Room Saint-Louis in French) in 1230‚Äì1240. At the time of Charles V of France, who reigned from 1364 to 1380, Paris extended widely beyond the walls of Philippe-Auguste. The king built a new enclosure, which encompassed these new quarters, as well as the Louvre castle other wise known as: The Wall of Charles V. King Charles decided to sacrifice some military devices to make the Castle more habitable as a safe, enjoyable royal residence. He was especially worried about the safety of himself and his family after the riot of February 22, 1358, led by √âtienne Marcel, the merchants' provost, that threatened the King inside the Palais de la Cit√©. This gradual change meant that the castle lost much of its original military purpose to the importance a safe royal residence. His architect added turrets, statues, and habitable surfaces; created many gardens; and pierced wider openings. King Charles V repurposed the northwest tower (tower of the Falconry) into the First Royal Library, containing nine hundred manuscripts. The miniature illustrations of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry show the Louvre castle during that time. They give a general idea of the layout of the fortress, although at that time aesthetic or comfort adjustments were made to the detriment of military concerns. During the Hundred Years' War, English soldiers commanded by Henry V of England allied to the Burgundian, who controlled Paris, entered the city. In December 1420 the English occupied the Louvre castle without a fight. There they found the city ruined by civil war and scarcity and stayed there until 1436. Progressive demolition to give place to the Cour Carr√©e The Louvre in 1622. Half-medieval and half- Renaissance. In 1525, Francis I of France was defeated in Pavia and held prisoner. During his captivity, the court interfered with the king's decisions using its droit de remontrance (right of remonstrance in French). In addition, the faculty of theology and the Parliament of Paris started to show some independence. The king held a lit de justice on July 24, 26 and 27, 1526 during which he demonstrated his authority and decided to take back his kingdom and make the Louvre castle his main residence in Paris. As a symbol of his authority, he ordered the demolition of the dungeon in 1528 in order to build an Italian style palace. In 1546, he charged the architect Pierre Lescot to build a modern palace in the spirit of the Renaissance architecture, with a large h√¥tel particulier and ceremonial rooms. After the death of Francis in 1547, his son Henry II of France continued the work by Pierre Lescot. Between December 1546 and March 1549, he had the west wall destroyed to build a ballroom and the south wall to erect the royal pavilion (1553‚Äì1556), which housed the royal apartments and the small gallery. After the death of Henry II, his widow Catherine de' Medici continued the development of the south wing for her apartments. From 1564 onwards, she prioritised the construction of the new Tuileries Palace and the establishment of a large Renaissance garden. Under Henri III of France, the Louvre became a space for the royalty, a place of entertainment and the theater of historical events such as the marriage of the future King Henri IV of France with Margaret of Valois which led to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. During his reign, Henri IV destroyed the remaining elements on the south side, including the moat, in order to build the Grande galerie (Great Gallery in French) connecting the Louvre and the Tuileries. This was completed in 1610. He also began the construction of the Cour Carr√©e on the base of the existing Lescot wing. The surface was four times the size of the original medieval court. Some buildings between the two palaces were also destroyed. This project, named le Grand Dessein (the Grand Design in French), also had a military function by establishing a covered walkway between the Louvre and the Tuileries outside the city walls. Henry IV created this walkway in case he needed to flee on horseback during a riot. In order to establish his power, on April 24, 1617, the young king Louis XIII of France murdered Concino Concini, the favorite of his mother Marie de' Medici, at the entrance gate connecting the castle to the city. Louis XIII demolished the northern part of the medieval enclosure in order to extend the Lescot wing in this direction, providing symmetry. The eastern part was demolished by Louis XIV of France to allow for the construction of the Louvre Colonnade.  Remains  One of the walls of the castle preserved in the Medieval Louvre. This is the wall facing the city with the support pillar of the drawbridge, the main entrance to the Louvre. During the 19th century, it was found that the dungeon, along with two of the four walls were not completely demolished, but instead the stones from the walls were taken down to fill ditches in preparation for construction of the Louvre palace. Many people don't realize that the medieval Louvre included a dungeon, however there are remains on display at the Louvre. During the construction of the Mus√©e du Louvre, the bases of the keep and the two walls were cleared. A major excavation campaign resulted in the discovery of hundreds of everyday life objects. They are now accessible to the public in a collection named Medieval Louvre which features the lower room (today known as the Salle Saint-Louis) and the objects found during the excavations (small games, jugs, flasks, ...).

He produced and dealt in art primarily of the Folk and Outsider genres, and was the founder of the Rising Fawn Folk Art Gallery. Early life Jimmy Hedges was born into a Tennessee industrialist family in 1942. His first profession was in the real estate industry, and he was also a trustee of the Tonya Foundation, which was founded by his grandfather. Hedges became a self-taught chainsaw woodcarver, and later a dealer/gallerist for other self-taught artists in the medium. He came upon the artform after taking a bet from folk artist Homer Green, who challenged him to see if he could do it. He later showed his carvings to a gallerist in Memphis, who encouraged him to start incorporating folk art into his repertoire. He then also began working in the genre of Outsider Art. Art career Hedges' work incorporated people and places that he encountered while exploring different parts of the United States. Hedges also engaged with social commentary, such as incorporating the figure of a Klansman with trousers that reflected that the person beneath the sheets was likely a law enforcement officer. His folk art additionally incorporated folk narratives he encountered during his travels. Most of his carvings are created from cedar wood. Hedges exhibited his work at festivals including the Outsiders Outside Art Fair, as well as the Intui's Collectorama in Chicago, and Folk Fest in Atlanta. Rising Fawn Folk Art As a dealer, Hedges sold his work and those of other artists through the Rising Fawn Folk Art Gallery. Artists represented by Rising Fawn included Jimmy Lee Sudduth, Purvis Young, and Charles Simmons. The gallery was founded near Chattanooga, Tennessee, on the Georgian side of Lookout Mountain, and exhibited the work of their artists in surrounding urban centers. Hedges actively promoted the artists with fliers and other printed materials, and sold their work at festivals. Hedges would hand deliver much of the work purchased through his gallery, and travelled the countryside visiting other artists in order to obtain their newest work. Adjacent to the gallery Hedges also ran the Rising Fawn Folk Art Sculpture Garden. He represented more than four hundred artists during his career. Many of the artists that Hedges represented were disabled in some manner, some mentally ill and others physically impaired. He also represented artists serving time in prison. The archives and papers of Hedges' personal records and the gallery became a part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art in 2016, two years after his death. The work contained within the collection includes work from 1980 through 2014, as well as photographs covering the work and artists of his gallery and the art shows he attended over the span of his career.

Practical theology has often sought to address a perceived disconnection between dogmatics or theology as an academic discipline on the one hand, and the life and practice of the church on the other.Theresa F. Latini, The Church and the Crisis of Community: A Practical Theology of Small-Group Ministry (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2011) As articulated by Richard Osmer, the four key tasks or questions to be asked by practical theology are: # What is going on? (the descriptive-empirical task) # Why is this going on? (the interpretative task) # What ought to be going on? (the normative task) # How might we respond? (the pragmatic task)  Definition  Gerben Heitink defines practical theology as ‚Äúthe empirically oriented theological theory of the mediation of the Christian faith in the praxis of modern society.‚Äù Practical theology consists of several related sub-fields: applied theology (such as missions, evangelism, religious education, pastoral psychology or the psychology of religion), church growth, administration, homiletics, spiritual formation, pastoral theology, spiritual direction, spiritual theology (or ascetical theology), political theology, theology of justice and peace and similar areas. Gerben Heitink, Practical theology: history, theory, action domains: manual for practical theology (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999) Ray Anderson writes that the first person to give practical theology a definition, C.I. Nitzch, defined it as the ‚Äútheory of the church‚Äôs practice of Christianity.‚Äù Anderson quotes John Swinton as defining practical theology as ‚Äúcritical reflection on the actions of the church in light of the gospel and Christian Tradition.‚Äù Swinton cites Don Browning's definition of practical theology as ‚Äúthe reflective process which the church pursues in its efforts to articulate the theological grounds of practical living in a variety of areas such as work, sexuality, marriage, youth, aging, and death.‚Äù  History  Practical theology was first introduced by Friedrich Schleiermacher in the early 1800s as an academic discipline encompassing the practice of Church leadership in his Brief Outline of the Study of Theology. Schleiermacher viewed practical theology as one of three theological sciences, along with philosophical theology and historical theology, together making theology whole.Chang Kyoo Lee, \\"Practical Theology as a Theological Discipline: Origins, Developments, and the Future.\\" Theologian Elaine Graham posits that practical theology has evolved over time. Originally focused more towards church leaders, she argues that it has become more personal and autobiographical.  Application  Other fields of theology have been influenced by practical theology and benefit from its usage, including applied theology (mission, evangelism, religious education, pastoral psychology or the psychology of religion), church growth, administration, homiletics, spiritual formation, pastoral theology, spiritual direction, spiritual theology (or ascetical theology), political theology, theology of justice and peace and similar areas.Gerben Heitink, Practical theology: history, theory, action domains: manual for practical theology (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999) Practical theology also includes advocacy theology, such as the various theologies of liberation (of the oppressed in general, of the disenfranchised, of women, of immigrants, of children, and black theology). The theology of relational care, which concerns ministering to the personal needs of others, may also be discussed as a field of practical theology.[citation needed] \\"Convergent practical theology\\" has emerged from the combined studies and practice of missiology with organizational development since the publication of Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America.Darrell Guder et al., Missional church: a vision for the sending of the church in North America (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998) This new perspective is described by Christian Boyd as \\"living our theology (primary and secondary) and practicing social science theologically, [so that] our minds are renewed and the community formed nurtures a new imagination for being and doing church.\\"Christian Boyd, \\"Formed and Always Being Reformed as a Community Under the Cross,\\" Luther Seminary, Doctoral Thesis, May 30, 2010. p. 9-11; 30-34.

The site was previously occupied by a 1902 American Milling Company warehouse, also designed by Geilfuss, which was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. The building was provided with four smoke ovens in one corner of each floor, walled with brick and originally with steel doors, and otherwise was largely open; after Armour moved out of the building in 1934, office partitions were added beginning in 1944, when a new owner, V.

Biography  = Early life and education = Davis was born in Indianapolis on November 26, 1905. After graduating from Vassar College in 1927, she studied for three years at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. = Career = After leaving school, Davis spent three years as a freelancer working on a variety of commissions. In 1933 she spent six months studying modern techniques and design under Buckminster Fuller at the Dymaxion factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. At the factory, she wrote later, she learned \\"the principles of good workmanship. I think there are a great many 'artists' but awfully few real craftsmen. Use of tools and neat, fast, strong construction are not taught much in art schools.\\" It was there that she learned how to work with wood, and began experimenting with abstract forms. Her figurative sculptures from the 1930s reflect her interest in the naive art of various folk cultures; for example, \\"Grotesque Bull\\" (shown), a terra cotta sculpture which was included in Dorothy Miller's \\"Americans 1942\\" exhibition at MoMA. Grotesque Bull, 1934 In spring 1935 Davis traveled to Russia to learn how Russian artists were organized and how socialized patronage affected their work. She concluded that Soviet artists failed to innovate because \\"the cheap academic traditions have been continued under the name of 'socialist realism'--that is, all the facts and none of the meaning of the subject.\\" From 1938 to 1941 Davis was the artist in residence at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. She described this period as \\"the most profitable and enjoyable three years of my life.\\" In 1939 she was commissioned by the federal Treasury Section of Fine Arts to paint a mural, Missouri Livestock, for the post office in La Plata, Missouri. Two years later she collaborated with Henry Kreis on a series of low-relief granite sculptures depicting the benefits of social security for the overdoor panels of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services building in Washington, D.C. After practicing as a commercial artist for thirty years, Davis decided to retrain as an archaeologist. She completed her Ph.D. at UCLA in 1965, writing a dissertation titled Anasazi Mobility and Mesa Verde Migrations (1964). She worked Science Direction at the San Diego Museum of Man, while continuing her desert studies, focusing on the southern California region of China Lake. Prior to her retirement, she established the Great Basin Foundation, which conducted paleo-environmental research. According to Joseph L. Chartkoff, Davis was \\"one of the most important figures in bringing scientific rigor and credibility to Paleoindian archaeology in California.\\" = Death and legacy = Davis died in San Diego on October 19, 1988.

By 2005 the company co-owned nine sugar beet farms in Belgorod Oblast. The company originally planned an IPO for 2010, which was delayed due to the volatility of the Russian market. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in April 2011. Prior to the IPO, 95% of Rosagro was controlled by company founder Vadim Moshkovich and his family. The company has grown significantly after 2014, benefiting from the weaker ruble, as well as bans on pork imports from the European Union. In 2016 the company filed a bankruptcy claim against Razgulay. Since 2016 the company exports corn to the Asia-Pacific region through its subsidiary in the Russian Far East. In 2017 it announced plans to expand meat production to northeastern China, and to invest $1 billion in dairy production.

In February 2008, David Hodgson was convicted of her murder despite the lack of a body, crime scene or body deposition site. Hodgson was jailed for life, with a recommendation that he serve at least 18 years, after being convicted on DNA and fake text messaging evidence which involved his travelling many miles so as to appear that Nicholl was still alive and camping some distance away from her home town. Disappearance The Nicholl family lived in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where Nicholl worked at the local supermarket and played guitar in pub bands. Nicholl's father was in the British Army and the family settled in Richmond when the eldest son also joined the army and was posted to Catterick. On the 30 June 2005, Nicholl told her parents that she was spending the night with friends, which was not uncommon for her, and took items with her that suggested she was going on a camping trip. She left the house at 6:00pm and that was the last confirmed sighting of Nicholl. Nicholl was reported missing by her parents on 4 July 2005 after they had had no contact with her over the previous days and her car (a white Rover 214i) was found parked in the Holly Hill Pub in Richmond. Nine days later, North Yorkshire Police interviewed David Hodgson, who was 45 at the time of Nicholl's disappearance, was a married father of two, and who had been Nicholls' boyfriend since she was 14 years old, though he maintained that their relationship was not sexual until she was 16 and that they had had sex only five times. Hodgson's two daughters had both attended the same school as Nicholl (St Francis Xavier School in Richmond). Around the time of the affair starting, it was said that there was some name-calling of Nicholl and eventually an assault in which the police were finally involved. During his first police interview, Hodgson denied having an affair with Nicholl and also denied anything to do with her disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was switched on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to believe she was alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as Carlisle in Cumbria and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to Hudswell. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier. Whilst there was some initial hope with the mobile phone messages (Ann Nicholl went to both locations to search for her daughter), police still maintained an active search for Nicholl which lasted the rest of the summer of 2005 and involved searching over 150 areas, septic tanks at farms and also utilised soldiers from Catterick Garrison to help out. During the investigation it was revealed that Nicholl had also started seeing Hodgson's elder brother, Robert, in the weeks prior to her disappearance. Robert Hodgson was unaware of Nicholl's being linked with his younger brother, despite the two brothers' erecting the huts in Sandbeck Plantation that critical evidence was found at during, and after the police searches. In December 2005, Ann Nicholl appeared on the BBC programme Crimewatch to appeal for help in finding her daughter and the conviction of her killer. In May 2007, police formally charged David Hodgson, and he appeared that same month in Northallerton Magistrates Court where he was remanded in custody until a trial early in 2008. Conviction The case came to court in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl to any of his ramshackle huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the A6136 road, south of Richmond. DNA evidence contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's nightdress, teddy bear and cassette player at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter stated in court that Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with Robert. Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated in court he had not seen Nicholl for some time. At court, the prosecution were able to establish that the text messages sent to family and friends days after her disappearance were not in the style that Nicholl would typically compose. The prosecution also submitted evidence that Hodgson had hired a car on two separate occasions (the 9 and 14 July 2005) and the distances travelled on those days fit the distances both there and back from Richmond to Carlisle and Richmond to Jedburgh. The dates also married up with the dates that the messages were sent from Nicholl's phone. The prosecution also said that David Hodgson was an intensely jealous man who was angry about Nicholl's new relationship with his brother, Robert. In February 2008, David Hodgson was found guilty of Nicholl's murder at Teesside Crown Court. Aftermath In September 2008, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners recognised Forensic Linguistics as a speciality. The UK government body, which strives to promote excellence in forensic practice, recognised that evidence given in cases like those against Hodgson and Stuart Campbell (the murderer of Danielle Jones, whose body, like Nicholl's, has never been found) had a significant impact on each case. In November 2009, a coroner ruled that Nicholl was dead and that her death was judged to be an unlawful killing.

To hold a noble title and a feudal fief, particularly after marriage, was most unusual and controversial for a woman, and even more so in the colony of Canada, where her right to it was questioned and she was sued as an usurper to it in court. Until 1713, she was forced to defend her right to the county in several high-profile court cases. She was a major business entrepreneur. In this respect, she was unusual: married women were legally wards under their husband's guardianship and could thus not formally engage in business, but as her spouse signed a power of attorney enabling her to do so.

It was founded in 1842 to provide a forum for discussion of free trade, a subject of violent debate at the time, and has continued to organize discussions on economic and social issues to the present day. History The Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√âconomie Politique was founded on 1 February 1842 in Paris. It was created by the followers of Jean-Baptiste Say to provide an open forum for debate on economics at a time when there were violent arguments over free trade. The society was led informally by Pellegrino Rossi as president and Count Ferdinand-Charles-Philippe d' Esterno (1805‚Äì83) as secretary. The debates were very academic in nature, and the society dissolved after a few meetings. Members included Louis Leclerc, Jean-Pierre Cl√©ment, Hippolyte Dusard, Louis Reybaud, Louis Wolowski, L√©on Faucher, Horace √âmile Say (1794‚Äì1860), son of Jean-Baptiste Say, Th√©odore Fix, Charles Dunoyer, Michel Chevalier, Hippolyte Passy and J√©r√¥me-Adolphe Blanqui. Three friends, Adolphe- Gustave Blaise (1811‚Äì86), Joseph Garnier (1813‚Äì81) and Gilbert Guillaumin (1801‚Äì64) decided to form a freer and more accessible society in which the sessions would be both enjoyable and instructive. It would meet once a month to dine and discuss political economy. This idea was accepted, and the first meeting of five people was held on 15 November 1842 including Blaise, Garnier, Guillaumin and Eug√®ne Daire (1798‚Äì1847). The numbers grew with successive meetings, including those from the Rossi-d'Esterno group and others. The society was open to men with very different positions in life and diverse political views, most of them influential either through their position or their writings. They could meet on neutral scientific grounds to exchange views on subjects such as the functions of the state, land rents, commercial freedom, public finances, the Cr√©dit Foncier, regulations and socialism. The central theme was always political economy. Until 1845 the society had no formal leadership, but each meeting had a president, generally Pellegrino Rossi, who chaired the discussion. In 1845 the society elected two presidents (Charles Dunoyer and Hippolyte Passy), two vice-presidents (Horace √âmile Say and Charles Renouard), a secretary, who became permanent in 1849 (Joseph Garnier) and a quaestor (Gilbert Guillaumin). In 1845 it was absorbed by the Soci√©t√© des √©conomistes. In 1847 this society changed its name to the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôEconomie Politique. By 1852 there were about sixty members from the legislature, administration, industry, commerce, teaching, law, letters and contributors to the Journal des √âconomistes. Distinguished visitors to Paris were invited to the meetings. √âmile Mireaux was a member of the Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie politique in Paris. He served as its secretary-general from 1930 to 1937, then president from 1937 to 1940. He belonged to the young school that helped adapt the old orthodox doctrines to the modern economy. As of 2017 the society had almost 450 members, and included academics, business executives and senior civil servants. It continued to provide a forum for discussion of economic and social issues. Once a month the society organizes a dinner-debate at the Cercle de l‚ÄôUnion Interalli√©e, with a personality invited to present their views on a specific topic. Since 1846 the society has published the Annales d‚Äô√©conomie politique, which contains papers and debates from the past academic season.

MAPK pathways have both a positive and negative regulation in plants. A positive regulation of MAPK networks is to help in assisting with stresses from the environment. A negative regulation of MAPK networks is pertaining to a high quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the plant.http://www.heribert-hirt.info/pdf/19608449_MAPK-cascade-signalling- networks-in-plant- defence.pdfhttp://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/reprints/MAPKCOPB01.pdf MAPK networks Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) networks can be found in eukaryotic cells. MAPK pathways in plants are known to regulate cell growth, cell development, cell death, and cell responses to environmental stimuli. Only a few of the MAPK mechanism components are known and have been studied. The components such as Arabidopsis MAPKKKs YODA, ANP2/ANP3, and MP3K6/MP3K7 functions in the development of the cell. MEKK1 and ANP1 function in the response to environmental stress. Unfortunately, only eight out of the twenty mitogen-activated protein kinases have been studied. The most commonly studied MAPKs are MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6, which are activated by a diversity of stimuli including abiotic stresses, pathogens, and oxidative stressors. MPK4 negatively regulates biotic stress signaling, while MPK3 and MPK6 function as positive mediators of defense responses. The plant has these positive and negative mediators allowing for normal plant growth and development, which has been proven true by the severely dwarfed phenotype of mpk4 and the embryo lethal phenotype of mpk3 and mpk6 mutants. Positive regulation pathways in plants Plants have many protection mechanisms to cope with stresses from the environment, which include ultraviolet light, cold or hot weather, windy days, and mechanical wounding. There are multiple pathways, but one pathway that plants have been able to develop is a self-defense mechanism by recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via cell surface-located pathogen-recognition receptors. These receptors induce intracellular signal pathways within the plant cells, while also resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity. Responses to PAMPs target broadly instead of specifically. This immunity requires downstream components via the MAPK cascade to activate the MAP kinases. The flagellin, a peptide of flg22, triggers a rapid and strong activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6. MPK4 and MPK6 can be activated by harpin proteins. MPK3 and MPK6 are very similar proteins and have a function as regulators in abscission, stomatal development, signaling various abiotic stresses, and defense responses to certain pathogens. Experimentation has proposed that the MAPK module MEKK1-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 may be responsible for flg22 signal transmission. All of the proposed modules appear to be correct expect for MEKK1 because plants with mekk1 mutated have a compromised flg22-triggered activation of MPK4, yet they have normal activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Data has shown that MAPK cascade is composed of MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6 in response to fungal pathogens. The observation shows that the activation of MPK3/MPK6 in conditional gain-of-function plants for MKK4/MKK5 or MEKK1/MKKKa is sufficient to induce camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in Arabidopsis. The stomata are considered to be the entry point for pathogenic invaders because microbial invaders enter the plant at the stomata. A recent study has shown that MAPK cascades play a role in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The main pathways in stomatal development and dynamics are MPK3 and MPK6. During a drought, the stomata closes and is believed to be mediated by the phytohormone, abscisic acid, and involves MKK1, MPK3, and MPK6. Another way of closing the stomata is through a closing process that is called pathogen-induced, which is an innate response from the plant. Campestris (Xcc) excretes a chemical that reverts stomatal closure that was caused by bacteria and abscisic acid (ABA). Most stomata close in the presents of ABA, but some are unresponsive to bacteria. In Arabidopsis Xcc does not revert bacteria-induced or ABA-induced stomatal closure. Scientists are not certain if MAPK cascades are responsible for the signaling, so further investigation is needed for this. Negative regulation The identification of MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 in pathogen signaling has been a tremendous finding. Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2 double and mpk4 mutations are dwarfed and acquire too much of reactive oxygen species. The mutations are considered to be from the enhancement of SA levels, which is partially reversed by bacterial SA hydrolase. Mekk1, mkk1/mkk2 double and mpk4 mutations have cell death occur spontaneously, pathogenesis-related genes and increased resistance to pathogens. MEKK1 appears to have deregulation pathways that are unknown and do not involve MKK1/MKK2 nor MPK4. MEKK1 interact with WRKY53, which is responsible for mekk1 genes set, and alter the activity of WRKY53 that is a short portion of MAPK signaling. Substrates of MPK4 are three proteins: WRKY33, WRKY25, and MKS1. Ternary MKS1-MPK4-WRKY33 complexes have been recognized by nuclear extracts. Recruitment of WRKY33 depends on the phosphorylation of MPK4. Once activated, MPK3 phosphorylates MKS1, which releases WRKY33 from the ternary complex. The free WRKY33 is believed to induce transcription on target genes., allowing for a negative regulation by MPK4. Pathogens have developed mechanisms that inactivate PAMP-induced signaling pathways through the MAPK networks. Andrea Pitzschke and her colleges claim ‚ÄúAvrPto and AvrPtoB interact with the FLS2 receptor and its co- receptor BAK1. AvrPtoB catalyzes the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of FLS2‚Äù (Pitzschke 3). AvrPto interacts with BAK1 and interrupts the binding of FLS2. Pseudomonas syringae have HopAI1, which is a phosphothreonin lyase, and dephosphorylates the threonine residue at the upstream MAPKKs. HopAI1 interacts with MPK3 and MPK6 allowing for flg22 activation to occur. In certain soil-borne pathogens that carry flagellin variants cannot be detected by FLS2, but there is still a triggered innate immune response. The immune response has been shown to be from the EF-Tu protein. Flg22, elf18, FLS2 and EFR have receptors that are in the same subfamily of LRR-RLKs, LRRXII. This means that elf18 and flg22 induce extracellular alkalization, rapid activation of MAPKs, and gene responses that are similar to each other. Although there appears to be an important relationship between MAPKs with EF-Tu-triggered defense, the evidence remains to be unclear. The reason for this unclear relationship is because of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which infects into segments of plant DNA. EFR1 mutants do not recognize EF-Tu, but there is no research on MAPK activities and efr1. Initiation of defense signaling can be a positive effect to the plant pathogens because activating MPK3 in response to flg22 causes phosphorylation and translocation of virE2 interacting protein 1 (VIP1). VIP1 serves as a shuttle for the pathogenic T-DNA, but the induction of defense genes can occur as well. This allows for the spreading and cessation of the pathogen in the plant, but the pathogen can overcome the problem by attacking VIP1 for proteasome degradation by VirF, which is a virulence factor that encodes an F-box protein.

In accordance with the custom of the period, the boys and girls would be placed in segregated schools by sex, and the girls educated by a female teacher. In France, such a position would normally be given to a nun (the school for boys was managed by the monks in Port Royal), but as there were no nunnery in Port Royal, a secular educator had to be given the position. Madame de Brice was given the position, and according to reports, she managed the school for girls in Port Royal very well; she also functioned as the governess for the children of the French governor of the colony.Ren√© Baudry, \\"BRICE, MADAME DE,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed August 17, 2017, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brice_madame_de_1E.html.

Personal life and family  Smith's birth date is unknown, and he may have been born either in Connecticut or Alfred, Maine.

In the 1850s he sailed in the Gulf of Mexico, working for the Southern Mail Steamship Company.  Civil War  = 1861 ‚Äì December 1862 = In February 1861 he was the captain of the steamer General Rusk and transported General John Salmon Ford and his troops to the mouth of the Rio Grande to receive the surrender of Union Major Fitz John Porter. Unattached to either side, Smith then contracted with Major Porter to transport the Union troops to New York. Steamship Star of the West approaching Fort Sumter In April 1861, back in the Gulf of Mexico, he and his ship General Rusk volunteered for service for the Confederates. On April 18, 1861, Smith and his ship assisted Colonel Earl Van Dorn in the capture of Star of the West (notable for being the target of the first shots of the civil war on January 9, 1861, in Fort Sumter) off Matagorda Bay via trickery: pulling alongside her under the pretense of transferring \\"friendly\\" troops which were expected from the transport Fashion.

The boarding troops promptly seized the Star of the West at bayonet point. Between October 1861 and December 1862 Smith and the General Rusk were under the command of CSN Commander William W. Hunter. On 7 November 1861, Smith and the General Rusk extinguished the fire aboard the stricken Royal Yacht following her encounter with , and towed her back to port.BRILLIANT EXPLOIT IN GALVESTON BAY.; Capture of the Privateer Royal Yacht Attempt to Cut Out the Steamer Rusk Resistance of the Rebels Bravery of the National Forces., NY Times, 19 December 1861 =December 1862 ‚Äì January 1863: Appointment to command, Battle of Galveston= Following the retreat from Galveston in the Battle of Galveston Harbor (1862), General Paul Octave H√©bert was relieved from command and replaced in November 1862 by General John B. Magruder who arrived in Texas. Previously acquainted with Smith, in December Magruder placed Smith in charge of all the steamers at his disposal. On Christmas Day 1862, Smith was charged with hastily improvising the , , along with the tenders Lucy Gwinn and the John F. Carr for battle as improvised Cottonclad warships. The Bayou City was outfitted with a single 32-pounder rifled cannon and the Neptune with two 24-pounders howitzers. Cotton bales were used to provide a semblance of protection that was somewhat effective in stopping small arm fire, however when asked by a soldier about artillery protection Smith bluntly replied: \\"None whatsover... our only chance is to get alongside before they hit us\\". Boarding devices resembling the Roman Corvus were placed on the hurricane deck of each boat. Facing Smith's forces were vastly superior Union naval forces: , , , , , , and four smaller vessels.The United States Gunboat Harriet Lane, Philip C. Tucker, The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 4 (Apr., 1918), pp. 360‚Äì380 The attack initially planned for 27 December 1862 was delayed to New Year's Eve, the Battle of Galveston. Smith's force was to attack from sea into the Harbor as General Magruder attacked from land crossing over the railroad trestle connecting the island to the mainland. Smith was to wait to be signaled by gunfire that the battle had begun, which was expected to occur at midnight. However, Magruder's forces were delayed by the difficulty of crossing his artillery over the trestle. After no signal came after midnight passed, Smith pulled back from the harbor to Red Fish Bar, a point fourteen miles away. Hearing the attack commencing at 04:00, Smith directed the naval contingent back to the harbor, probably reaching it an hour after the initial shots were fired. C.S. Bayou City captures the USS Harriet Lane during the Battle of Galveston Attacking just before daybreak, the CS Neptune was severely damaged and sunk, but Smith, aboard the CS Bayou City managed to ram into the Harriet Lane, board, and capture her, reportedly personally killing US Navy Commander Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright and recovering a valuable signal book. Though still outnumbered, Smith demanded the surrender of US fleet from commander William B. Renshaw, who had run aground aboard the USS Westfield. While under the flag of truce, Renshaw blew up his vessel and died in the explosion. Smith boarded the USS John F. Carr and captured her as well, while the rest of the US Navy ships escaped to sea.The Seventh Star of the Confederacy: Texas During the Civil War, Kenneth Wayne Howell, page 126 The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates, Edward Alfred Pollard, page 365Civil War in Texas and the Southwest, Roy Sillivan, page 80The Civil War Naval Encyclopedia, Volume 1, Spencer Tucker, page 251 Aboard the captured USS John F. Carr, Smith gave chase to the fleeing Union ships, however the small ship was unable to match the speed of the larger warships. Turning around back to the bay, Smith captured three small Union ships (the Cavallo, Elias Pike, and Lecompte) with their cargo. Battle on the Bay: The Civil War Struggle for Galveston, Edward Terrel Cotham, page 130 Following the battle, Smith won praise for his gallant conduct, including a mention in a joint resolution of the Congress of the Confederate States.THE REBEL CONGRESS.; THANKS TO MAGRUDER., New York Times, 24 February 1863 General Magruder attempted to secure a regular Naval commission as commander for him, one of several repeated attempts, which did not result in an actual commission being granted.Texas in the Confederacy: military installations, economy, and people, Bill Winsor, 1978, page 80 =January 1863 ‚Äì August 1864 = Photo Leon Smith as published in governor Lubbock's memoirs Six Decades in Texas (1900). The caption reads \\"Commodore Leon Smith, C.S.N\\", however Smith was never officially in the confederate navy, and while described variously as a naval lieutenant, captain, and commodore or army major, and colonel, he was not actually a commissioned by either army or navy. Following the battle, the Confederate States Navy sent Lieutenant Joseph Nicholson Barney to take charge of naval operations in Galveston, including the captured Harriet Lane. However, after discussions with Magruder who was not willing to relinquish control of the cottonclads, Barney conceded the appointment, and in a letter to Confederate naval secretary Stephen Mallory recommended that the Navy relinquish control. Barney later explained that he made his recommendation since he considered that the presence of two separate marine forces with independent commanders would lead to discord and confusion.Civil War High Commands, John Eicher & David Eicher, page 893 Smith remained in charge of all vessels in Texas, and by order of General Magruder appointed \\"Commander, Marine Department of Texas\\". On September 5, 1863, he was at Orange, Texas, inspecting the Texas and New Orleans Railroad. On September 8 he was at Beaumont, Texas, when a Union force under the command of Major General William B. Franklin with four gunboats, eighteen transports, and 5,000 infantry assaulted up the Sabine River in the Second Battle of Sabine Pass. Smith immediately ordered all Confederate troops in Beaumont, some eighty men, aboard the steamer Roebuck and sent them down the river to reinforce Fort Griffin. Smith and a Captain Good rode to the fort on horseback, reaching the fort some three hours before the steamer, arriving just as the Union gunboats and Sachem came within range of Fort Griffin, which was manned by forty-seven troops. Assisting in the defense of the Fort, Smith took charge of the Clifton and Sachem which were captured during the battle which was one of the most one-sided Confederate victories of the war: no Confederate losses versus 200 killed, wounded or captured Union troops and two lost gunships.Sabine Pass: The Confederacy's Thermopylae, Edward T. Cotham, Jr.The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government (Complete), Jefferson DavisConfederate Military History: A Library of Confederate States, Volume 11, Clement A. Evans, pages 109‚Äì110 From November to December 1863, he was sent by Magruder to direct the naval side of the defense of Indianola, Texas, where Colonel William R. Bradfute was commanding the land forces. As part of the engagement, the Confederates retreated in the Battle of Fort Esperanza. Smith commanded John F. Carr, Cora, and eleven small vessels with sharpshooters and artillery; however disagreements with Bradfute were a hindrance to operations. Smith chose not to take the offensive, fighting defensively. In early 1864 Brig. Gen. William Steele, who was given command of Galveston, attempted to take control of the naval forces there, however Magruder asserted Smith's authority. In the summer of 1864, due to better land fortifications and the developing state of the war (most Texas troops were transferred to Louisiana in March), the marine contingent was less needed and Smith was relieved from duty at his request by Captain Henry S. Lubbock (the brother of governor Francis Lubbock and who had been the captain of CS Bayou City (Smith's flagship) in the Battle of Galveston) who commanded the marine department sub- district at Galveston. Smith was ordered by Magruder to report \\"by letter\\" to the Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. =August 1864 ‚Äì June 1865= By 1864, Smith was well known by name to Federal authorities. Following a news report in the Houston Daily Telegraph that Smith was going to be sent to London to acquire a fast steamboat for privateering, that was reprinted by New York papers, Federal authorities attempted to disrupt the alleged scheme.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, United States Naval War Records Office, 1896, pages 379‚Äì380, 398United States Army and Navy Journal, Volume 2: Various Naval Matters, 1 October 1864, page 93Congressional Serial Set: Letter from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the Navy, regarding the alleged fitting of a cruiser in a British port by Colonel Leon Smith, C.S.

In November 1864 he was in Havana where his presence was noted by Union officials, and where he was detained by Spanish authorities for a time. He subsequently piloted the steamer Wren to Galveston through the Union blockade. In an April 1865 letter Magruder writes that Smith will bring in a valuable Confederate steamer probably in the next dark moon.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, United States.

In Fort Wrangel, he operated a trading post and bowling alley in partnership with William King Lear. On October 29, 1869 he was involved in a beating of an Indian who he believed struck his son, Leon B., though later Smith discovered this was not the case. On 25 December 1869 a Stikine Indian named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who severely wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot Smith fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December,The Aleut Internments of World War II: Islanders Removed from Their Homes by the United States, Russell W.

The film, starring Wesley Snipes, R. J. Mitte and Jedidiah Goodacre, was released on June 3, 2017, in the United States and Canada. Plot During a time when strange atmospheric disturbances are occurring at various locales around the globe, a group of teenagers go on a vacation trip to a secluded cottage in the woods. At a filling station along the way they have a bad encounter with a man (Wesley Snipes) who calls himself \\"The Hunter\\". At the cottage, the teenagers begin exploring and come across a seemingly abandoned cabin. Inside, they find pictures and realize it's the Hunter's house, and furthermore, that he was formerly an astronaut. When he returns unexpectedly they sneak out and run away. That night, when the Hunter shows up in the woods outside their cottage, they believe he is there to attack them. One of them, Rob (Niko Pepaj), goes to the car to get his gun, but on the way back he sees an alien under the porch and panics but he doesn't tell his friends. Later, during the atmospheric disturbances, they see a glow of light. Only Kara seems to know what it is, and seems terrified of it. When an alien enters the house, Rob panics and accidentally shoots Kara. He breaks down and turns on his friends. Charlie stops him by rendering him unconscious. The remaining friends run for the car and drive away in panic. When Rob suddenly appears in the road, Charlie swerves to avoid him and crashes the car. They watch from the wreckage as a UFO appears and abducts Rob, allowing the others to make their escape. Unbeknownst to the teenagers, the Aliens have come to Earth, abducting thousands of humans. On the run from the aliens with the others, Brendan is injured by a bear trap placed by the Hunter. The Hunter appears and saves them from a pursuing alien, and takes them back to his cabin. The Hunter ambushes an alien in a pit and seems to take personal pleasure in killing it. The Hunter explains that he was abducted and experimented-on by the aliens years ago. He shows them scarifications left on his body by the aliens; furthermore, he demonstrates that he can move objects telekinetically. He explains that the aliens have visited Earth several times in the distant past, and through \\"enhancements\\" made to abductees, have controlled the evolution of life on Earth. Since his retirement as an astronaut he has been preparing for their return, dedicating himself to putting an end to their reign. But the aliens besiege the cabin and the teenagers all end up being taken up to the spaceship, where they are among a few thousand humans who are abducted, experimented on, then returned to Earth. The teenagers all wake up back at their cottage, with no memory of having been abducted or experimented on. Kara, who had been killed, also appears to be alive and well. On the road, they are stopped by a military roadblock; although the alien ships have departed as mysteriously as they'd arrived, the government has responded to the mass abductions by putting a plan in place to quarantine anyone who shows the telltale scarifications from having been abducted. When the soldiers attack, with the help of the Hunter the teenagers using their alien-given \\"enhancements\\" slaughter the soldiers, instead.

Plot Chris is a 38-year-old convict who has recently been released from prison. At a surprise party to celebrate Chris's release from prison, Chris reunites with Carol, his former high school teacher, who was his penpal during the 20 years he was in prison and helped with his release. After encountering him again outside a restaurant where he abruptly hugs her and gives her a portrait he made of her, Carol begins to realize Chris may have a crush on her though her own feelings for him are complicated as she is married with a teenage daughter. After Carol urges him to try to meet and socialize with other women, Chris bikes over to Carol's home and kisses her, confessing that he is in love with her. Despite her deep emotional connection to Chris, Carol insists that they should try to be friends. Returning home, she approaches her husband, who now no longer sleeps in their bedroom, and tries to initiate sex, but he rejects her. Chris goes over for breakfast at Carol's, and he, Carol and Carol's teenage daughter Hildy get along well though the mood is spoiled by the arrival of Carol's husband, Tom. Chris also feels frustrated by the limitations of Carol's time, the fact that she is helping another convict get parole, his brother's betrayal by staying friends with the man who put him in prison, and his inability to find a job. Hildy becomes interested in Chris and befriends him. She is surprised to learn that he holds her mother in such high esteem and credits her with helping him get through prison. Despite her earlier words telling Chris they can only be friends, Carol continues her emotional affair with Chris. Chris asks Carol to spend one day with him where the two of them can finally be free. They meet up for the day and go out to dinner and an arcade before going to a motel. They consummate their relationship and confess their love for one another. The following morning, leaving the motel, they are seen by Tom and Hildy. Tom attacks Chris, who hits him in the shins before fleeing. Hildy disappears and is later found by Carol after some help by Chris. Carol apologizes for not paying enough attention to Hildy and prioritizing Chris, though Hildy reassures her mother that she was able to make a difference in Chris's life. Carol says the relationship between her and Chris was a one-time occurrence. Tom moves out of the family home, Chris gets a job, and Hildy breaks into Chris and his brother's home, where she leaves an art sculpture which Chris recognizes as a sign of forgiveness. Carol goes to visit Chris and tells him that their goals are ultimately incompatible since he wants a simple life and she now craves a more fulfilling one. Nevertheless she asks Chris out on a date, hoping they will get to know each other as they are in the present, to which Chris agrees.

Many of the Yardbirds' official and non-canonical sessions are owned by an assortment of copyright holders who seem to easily and constantly license them to virtually anyone who will pay for them, which causes significant catalog confusion. As an example, there are many versions of their BBC release, most having only slightly different song listings, usually only adding or removing one or two songs. Some versions are identical in their song list but have very different covers. Glimpses 1963‚Äì1968 is an obvious change from that mentality as it seems to have been compiled by Yardbirds experts and fans trying to fill-in the gaps of their official releases.

She was the first woman to manage an Australian theatre as the director of Theatre Royal, Hobart in 1840-1847. She had a significant role in the development of the early theatre in Tasmania and Australia. Life Anne Clarke arrived in Hobart in Tasmania in 1834, engaged to perform at the company of J. P. Deane at the Theatre Royal, Hobart, which was however then still under construction (it was not to open until 1837). =Acting career= She arrived in Tasmania just one year after the introduction of professional theater in Tasmania by the travelling company of Samuel Cameron and Cordelia Cameron from England, and only two years after the first professional theatre performed in Australia (at Barnett Levey's Royal Hotel in Sydney in December 1832),Richard Fotheringham, Angela Turner: Australian Plays for the Colonial Stage: 1834-1899 making her one of the first professional actors active in Australia. She and another actress, Dinah Rudelhoff (later director of the Geelong Theatre in 1845), was advertised to appear on stage in Hobart that summer, and were both referred to as experienced actors: \\"Annette‚ÄîMiss Remens, Peggy‚ÄîMiss Rudelhoff (from the Theatre Royal English Opera House [London], being their first appearance on this stage).\\" Anne Clarke married Michael Clarke. She performed in the theatre company of Samuel Cameron in 1834-36 and that of his rival John Meredith in 1836-40. =Manager= In April 1840, she became the manager of Theatre Royal. Though Cordelia Cameron managed the theatre in Launceston in 1836 and was as such the first woman theatre director in Australia de facto, Cameron only did so as the proxy of her spouse during his absence, and Clarke was thereby the first woman to have formally been theatre director in Australia. She recruited new actors from England in 1841‚Äì42, composed of Jerome Carandini, Theodosia Stirling, John Howson and Frank Howson. By importing professional actors, she is regarded to have established acting as a respectable profession for both sexes in Australia. By advertising for respectable women interested in becoming actors, and giving them training, she introduced a new profession for women in the colony. The actors of her company somewhat became the pioneer Australian actor generation, many of whom moved on to careers in Melbourne and Sydney. She was highly recommended for her work, credited by the press with introducing 'a better class of performer and a superior style of management'E Webby, 'Anne Clarke', in P Parsons (ed), Companion to theatre in Australia, Sydney, 1995. and for giving theatre, which was then regarded as somewhat dubious, a good name. In July 1842, she applied Parliament for an official government license for her theatre, thereby separating it from other places of entertainment and making it a respected institution: in September that year, the \\"Act for regulating Places of Public Entertainment and for punishing Persons Keeping disorderly Houses.\\", was passed. She is credited for having given the foundation for professional music life in the colony. The contemporary press credited her for her work developing the cultural life in the colony. She was regarded as an efficient businessperson and a progressive artist. Despite her good critic and artistic success, however, the colony was small and the theatre was still forced to struggle with its economy. Anne Clarke retired in 1847. She was by then separated from her spouse. Her later life is unknown. In the 1860s her theatre was still regarded as the role model for theatre life in the colony. See also * Mrs W. H.

History  The exact date of the construction of the church is unknown. It is mentioned for the first time in 1379, after having been erected as a parish by Bernard II du Sault, bishop of Saintes, on the 7th of July of the same year. The roof of the church is renovated in 1627. Between 1636 and 1642, new baptismal font are installed and a sacristy is added between 1636 and 1653. On several occasions during the 17th century the church is enlarged and decorated. After the French Revolution, in 1793, part of the religious objects are sent to the Monnaie de La Rochelle to be melted. Oreillan, the priest of Loix of that period, seeing the pillages committed by the republicans, steals with Aunis, an accomplice from Ars, sacred vases in order to protect them. The misappropriation is however discovered and they are both tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal, and later decapitated. The year after in 1794 the remaining furniture of the church is sold in auction. The building becomes momentarily a Temple of Reason. In 1827, part of the structure of the nave collapses. Moreover, the steeple is no longer plumb. Antoine Brossard, architect of the Charente- Inf√©rieure department and diocesan architect, therefore undertakes in 1830 the reconstruction as well as the enlargement of the church, which will be realized by Jean-Baptiste Malardier, masonry contractor. On January 30, 1831, the church is blessed. The following year, the church tower is repaired by carpenter F√©lix Bonnaudet. In 1843, the bell is restored by the founder Pierre Huard and the alleys are paved by the mason Eloi Texier. The grandstand is built in 1862 by Am√©d√©e Guillet and various renovation works are carried out between 1832 and 1896. In 1873, a new chapel is built for the baptismal font. In 1877, work is done by Fournier, at the bell-tower and on the stained-glass windows. Bricklayer Prosper Banier, of Ars, restores the roof in 1896. Following the law on the separation of churches and the state in 1905, the Republican motto \\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\\" is engraved on the pediment of St. Catherine's Church, and it is still visible today. Moreover, the church becomes the property of the commune. During the years 1980 and 1984, the building is renovated and new stained glass windows created by Aramis Pentec√¥te, master glassmaker, are installed. Important restoration work in partnership with the Fondation du Patrimoine took place in 2008.  Ex-Voto  Facade before the restoration of 2008 Sainte-Catherine contains two ex-voto ships. The first is a model frigate suspended from the vault of the nave dating from the late 18th or early 19th century. It is built in three-masted squares and is equipped with 44 cannons on two sides. Its prow is endowed with a character in republican colors and its hull made on slats. It is made of polychrome wood. The second ex-voto is a model of the \\"Tikocco\\", race track, which was created after the tragedy of the Fastnet in 1979. This famous race which turned very quickly to the drama in August 1979, caused 15 victims. The ship model is offered in recognition by survivors.

K. Jemisin. It was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2018. Reviews of the book upon its release were highly positive. It is the third volume in the Broken Earth series, following The Fifth Season and The Obelisk Gate, both of which also won the Hugo Award.  Setting  As with the other books in the Broken Earth series, The Stone Sky is mostly set in a single supercontinent referred to as the Stillness by its inhabitants. Most of humanity lives in city-states referred to as \\"comms,\\" and are segregated into social castes based on their usefulness to society. The Stillness is constantly wracked by geological cataclysms, and every few hundred years an event is severe enough to touch off a global volcanic winter, referred to as a Fifth Season. Some characters, referred to as orogenes, have the ability to manipulate geological energies on a large scale, as well as magic on a smaller scale. They are a persecuted and feared minority, though it is largely due to their efforts humanity has survived the Seasons at all.  Plot  Following the events of The Obelisk Gate, the former inhabitants of Castrima-under are moving north after damage by rival comm Rennanis has compromised the mechanisms of the geode and made it uninhabitable. Essun, who has been in a coma since opening the Obelisk Gate, awakens to find that her arm has turned to stone as a consequence of the massive magical energies of the Gate. She is nursed back to health, and finds that the Moon is approaching the closest point in its long, elliptical orbit, meaning that she has only a short time to return it to a normal orbit and end the Fifth Seasons forever. Meanwhile, Essun's daughter Nassun is recovering from the shock of using an obelisk to kill her father by turning him to stone. Despondent and angry, she resolves to use the Obelisk Gate to cause the approaching Moon to collide with Earth and destroy both. Her Guardian, Schaffa, agrees to help her reach the only city on the other side of the planet, Corepoint; from there, the Obelisk Gate can be activated without the need for the central control obelisk that Essun used. The comm reaches Rennanis after a costly desert crossing, where Essun learns that Nassun is planning to open the Gate as Essun did, which would almost certainly mean her death. She departs for Corepoint with a small company to intercept Nassun. Just prior to leaving, she learns she is pregnant by Lerna, the former healer from her old comm Tirimo, with whom she has started a relationship. Hoa, the stone eater who has been following her since she left Tirimo, offers to take them by transporting directly through the Earth; however, as they traverse through the center of the planet (skirting around the core), they are attacked by a rival faction of stone eaters and Lerna is killed. Nassun and Schaffa reach the ruins of a city in the Antarctic region, from which Schaffa believes transportation is available to Corepoint. They descend into the ruins, where they find a functional transportation system linking to Corepoint directly through the center of the planet. During their transit through the core, it is revealed that the Earth is a living consciousness, furious with humanity's attempts to control it and the loss of Earth's moon, which Earth blames humanity for. The core is rich with the magical energy that forms the Earth's consciousness, and Nassun realizes this directly fuels the Guardians' abilities and longevity through an iron shard embedded in their brains. Through flashbacks, the story of Hoa is revealed: in the distant past, human technology, which seamlessly fuses advanced biotechnology and magic, has reached its pinnacle with the creation of the Obelisk Gate, a network of obelisks designed to tap the Earth's magical essence to create an inexhaustible source of energy. To accomplish this, scientists have created a race of humans with exquisite sensitivity to magic based on the DNA of a race of people the now-dominant culture defeated and subjugated. These \\"tuners\\" will control the Gate and tap the magic from Earth's core. However, the night before the Gate is to be activated, the tuners discover the fate of the people their genetic code was based on: they are kept alive as batteries, wired to the obelisks to charge them with magical energy, in eternal torment. The lead tuner, Hoa, decides to turn the Gate's energies back onto the city of Syl Anagist, destroying it rather than perpetuating this injustice. As he and his fellow tuners attempt to do so, the Earth itself takes control of the obelisks and tries to use them to melt the crust of the Earth, which will sterilize it of almost all life. Hoa and the other tuners manage to avert this catastrophe by preventing some of the obelisks from activating, at the expense of their physical bodies: they are all transformed into the first stone eaters, and the Moon is flung into a high elliptical orbit by the massive energies involved. Nevertheless, enough of the obelisks are activated to cause worldwide devastation and plunge humanity into a dark age, wracked by the Fifth Seasons. This is also known as \\"The Shattering\\". In the present day, at Corepoint, the Earth removes its iron shard from Schaffa's brain, dooming him to an early death. Distraught, Nassun decides to use the Gate to transform everyone on Earth into stone eaters, rather than destroying the Earth and Moon outright. Essun arrives and attempts to seize control of the Gate using the central control obelisk in order to return the Moon to orbit, end the Seasons, and save Nassun from certain death. They struggle, but neither can gain an upper edge, and Essun gives up to allow her daughter to complete her task, rather than risk her destruction. She releases control of the Gate and is completely turned to stone. Nassun, moved by the sight, decides to complete her mother's task and use the Gate to return the Moon to orbit. In the aftermath, the Fifth Seasons are ended and civilization starts to rebuild. In a cave deep underground, Hoa, at the end of The Fifth Season revealed to be the narrator of the series, patiently awaits the rebirth of Essun as a stone eater. She emerges from a geode and expresses her familiar wish to make the world better. Hoa and Essun set off together to do so. It is implied that the entire trilogy is Hoa describing Essun's life to her, as to remind her of her previous life and connect her with her lost self.  Narration  The Broken Earth series uses several different styles of narration. The most widely remarked upon is its use of second person. It is eventually revealed that the books' narrator is Hoa. In The Stone Sky, Hoa narrates portions of the book set in the past in first person, and portions set in the present in second person (for Essun's perspective) and third person (for Nassun's and Syenite's perspective). Jemisin has stated that she isn't sure what prompted her to try writing Essun's chapters from a second person point-of-view, but that she ultimately chose to keep writing in second person because it conveyed \\"disassociation of [Essun], the not-all-here of her\\".  Reception  The Stone Skys release was anticipated on several \\"best of\\" upcoming science fiction and fantasy lists, including The Washington Post and io9, and reception upon its release was laudatory, winning Jemisin a third consecutive Hugo Award for Best Novel,. This is an extraordinary achievement, as Jemisin has won the Hugo Award for best novel in three consecutive years. In starred reviews, Publishers Weekly summed up the novel as having \\"vivid characters, a tautly constructed plot, and outstanding worldbuilding\\" that came together in \\"an impressive and timely story of abused, grieving survivors fighting to fix themselves and save the remnants of their shattered home\\", and Kirkus Reviews noting that \\"Jemisin continues to break the heart with her sensitive, cleareyed depictions of a beyond-dysfunctional family and the extraordinarily destructive force that is prejudice.\\" RT Book Reviews gave the book five stars, higher than the first two books in the series. Library Journal did not give The Stone Sky a star, but called it a \\"powerful conclusion\\" with a \\"fully developed world, detailed settings, and complex characters\\". NPR's reviewer Amal El-Mohtar praised the novel's twist on traditional fantasy and science-fiction, which usually posits that a world is worth saving. \\"The Stone Sky rejects this out of hand\\", El- Mohtar writes. \\"If the Broken Earth trilogy as a whole shows a world where cataclysm and upheaval is the norm, The Stone Sky interrogates what right worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist.\\" Tor.com's Niall Alexander, who was critical of The Obelisk Gate, declared that The Stone Sky was a \\"comprehensive confirmation of N. K. Jemisin as one of our very finest fantasists\\", and that as a whole, the series is \\"one of the great trilogies of our time\\". Barnes & Noble's Joel Cunningham agreed, asserting that it \\"reshapes the face of epic fantasy\\", as did The Verges Andrew Liptak, praising the book as \\"a triumphant achievement in fantasy literature\\".

This has been authenticated on a map by Lt. Gen P.S. Bhagat of India and Lt. Gen Abdul Hamid Khan of Pakistan on a map on December 11, 1972‚Äù. It is the highest peak along the Marpo La ridge and dominates the entire area on both the sides of the Line of Control.: Point 5353 dominates the Eastern Shoulder of the Pass, and since it is the highest point in that area it could be called the dominating feature. It dominates, by observation and fire, the complete area on both side of the Line of Control.Point 5353 controversy rears its head again, The Tribune, 28 August 2002: The denial prompted by the media reports ... conveniently overlooked the factor that the most dominating feature on the Indo-Pak border in the Kargil region - Point 5353 - is under the Pakistani army control.Gen Ashok K. Mehta, Point 5353 still in Pakistan‚Äôs possession, The Tribune (Chandigarh), 13 June 2004: Point 5353 is the summit of pinnacles on the watershed in the Dras sector. ... Its colossal domination of the Dras Bowl and Sandow valley was achieved by the Pakistan Army, cleverly using the two south-facing ridge lines emanating from it and paralysing the movement in Dras.: The entire Drass Sector including Mushkoh is dominated by a series of heights along the Marpola Ridge which emanates from Faranshat village in POK. Point 5353, a prominent height on this ridge overlooks both the Mushkoh-Drass Valleys and NH 1D, and dominates the approach to POK.: Pt 5353 is the highest peak in this area (16500 feet). It is the most dominating feature in Dras Valley, and is on a confluence of number of spurs and overlooks the long stretch of Srinagar-Leh highway. Today, Point 5353 remains in Pakistani military possession. The peak became a subject of controversy after the Kargil War. Soon after the war had ended The Hindu correspondent Praveen Swami and an Indian opposition party leader, Ram Kumar Anand claimed that the peak was inside the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) and it was captured by the Pakistan Army during the Kargil War. They also claimed that the Indian troops had unsuccessfully tried to recapture Point 5353 on 18 May 1999. The report also added that Indian troops captured Point 5310 on the Pakistani side of LoC in retaliation in April 2000.  Geography  The Marpo La pass is one of very few passes in the high Himalayas of Ladakh that allows north‚Äìsouth communication. The 1949 Cease-Fire Line between India and Pakistan as well as the 1972 Line of Control pass through the Marpo La pass. The ridge adjoining the pass to the east, which is also referred to as the 'Marpo La ridge', runs in a northwest-southeast axis and contains a number of tall peaks. The point 5353, so named because of its height in metres, is the tallest peak on the Marpo La ridge. Its older name is Point 17561, representing its height in feet. The Line of Control in this area is flanked by the Shingo River valley of Pakistani-administered Kashmir in the north and the Dras River valley of Indian-administered Kashmir in the south. Both these valleys represent major lines of east‚Äìwest communication in the respective regions of Kashmir. The Shingo and Dras rivers join together further east near Kakshar. To the south of the Line of Control is India's Kargil district and to the north is Pakistan's Skardu district. According to the Indian Army sources, the Point 5353 itself is on the Line of Control. However, after the end of the Kargil War, a controversy erupted in India as to which side of the Line of Control the peak lay. Point 5070, 3 km west of Point 5353 is the closest peak to the Marpo La pass.B. L. Kak, Pakistan Troops Pose Threat To Dras-Kargil Highway, Daily Excelsior, 29 August 2000. The second tallest peak on the Marpo La ridge, Point 5240, is 1.2 km southeast of the Point 5353. It is on the Indian side of the Line of Control. Both points 5070 and 5240 are currently held by India. The Sando nullah (stream) starts just below the Marpo La pass and flows southeast, joining the Drass River. A track running alongside the Sando Nullah is the key communication link between the town of Dras and the Marpo La pass.  Strategic significance  The Point 5353 is at an aeral distance of 12 km from Dras, through which passes the strategic National Highway 1 of India linking Srinagar to Leh. In 1999, Pakistani forces occupied all the peaks in the vicinity and directed artillery fire at the highway, which led to Indian retaliation and the Kargil War. The Indian Army fought to regain control of Tiger Hill and Tololing peaks, which posed a more direct threat to the highway. Point 5240 and 5353 were not cleared during the war. Their status was settled during the negotiations after the end of hostilities. The Indian Army admits that Point 5353 offers a view of the National Highway. However, it say that the peak is not comparable in strategic importance to Tololing and Tiger Hill. But commentators state other views. The Point 5353 dominates the eastern shoulder of the Marpo La pass and the Sando nullah approach to the pass. Since it is the tallest peak in the area, it is said to be a \\"dominating feature\\". Former Lt. Col. Kuldip Singh Ludra states, \\"it dominates, by observation and fire, the complete area on both side of the Line of Control.\\"Sandeep Dikshit, Army fails to clear controversy over Point 5353, The Hindu, 28 August 2002: \\"The importance of this feature arises from the fact that it overlooks Marpo La, a key pass on the LoC which India dominates, and also supplements the Pakistani observation of National Highway 1A, lifeline of Siachen and Leh.\\"  Line of Control  The 1972 Line of Control is part of the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan, whereby the two countries agreed to respect the line without prejudice to their respective positions in the Kashmir dispute. The line was delineated by six army officers each of India and Pakistan and signed on 11 December 1972. Its territorial precision is remarkable, according to scholar Brian Cloughley. Along with the agreement, a series of maps indicating the boundary were also prepared and exchanged by the two sides. The Indian government states that Point 5353 is on the Line of Control as delineated on maps in 1972 after the Simla Agreement. Retired Brigadier Surinder Singh, who commanded the 121 Infantry Brigade and was sacked for alleged poor performance, claimed that the peak was 300 meters inside Indian territory.Point 5353 still under Pak occupation: brig (Retd.) Surinder Singh, Zee News, 7 July 2004. Praveen Swami, based on Army's one-inch maps, estimated that it was one kilometre inside the Indian territory.Praveen Swami, Controversy on point 5353, The Hindu Business Line, 13 August 2000: \\"First, the Army's own one-inch maps... make clear that point 5353 is on the Indian side of the LoC. Copies of these maps, in Business Line's possession, show that the Marpo La ridge, on which point 5353 is located, does slope down into the Pakistan side of the LoC. But the summit and southern face of point 5353, where Pakistan has built fortified bunkers, are unmistakably on the Indian side of the LoC.\\" A couple of other Indian newspapers agreed that it was in Indian territory.Rahul Bedi, Fears of fresh clash over Kashmir peak, The Telegraph, 11 August 2000: \\"Military sources said Point 5353, a 17,397 ft peak on Indian territory, was under Pakistani control...\\"Manu Pubby, Near Tiger Hill, Point 5353 still Pak-occupied, The Indian Express, 13 July 2009: \\"While the point is clearly on the Indian side of the LoC, it remains in Pakistani control...\\" Controversy after the Kargil War Soon after the Kargil War was over, some Indian media reported that Point 5353, a strategically important peak in the Dras sector, was still under Pakistan's control. After this, the Indian Army said that the media reports were an \\"inspired\\" campaign to malign their image. They said that the peak was never in Indian possession. = The Hindu Business Line report = On 11 August 2000, The Hindu Business Line published a report titled Pakistan still occupies key Drass point, authored by noted journalist and security specialist Praveen Swami. It stated that the Point 5353 was \\"inside the Indian side of the Line of Control\\" and the Pakistani troops \\"held the mountain through the Kargil war and continue to do so today.\\" According to Swami, \\"Artillery observers on peak 5,353 metres can direct accurate artillery fire on to up to 20 km of the National Highway 1A, and cripple Indian defensive positions from Mushkoh to Bhimbet.\\" Swami narrated that, during the war, the Indian commander Amar Aul of the 56 Mountain Brigade was given the objective of securing point 5353, but he was unable to do so within the time frame available. Instead, he occupied two peaks on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control, point 4875 and point 4251 before the ceasefire came into force. In the negotiations carried out between the Brigadier Aul and a Pakistani interlocutor called Colonel Saqlian in August 1999, both sides committed themselves to leave the points 5353, 5240, 4251 and 4875 unoccupied. In October 1999, according to the report, Brigadier Aul decided to take control of the point 5240 as well as 5353. 16 Grenadiers successfully took control of 5240. However, 1-3 Gurkha Rifles, tasked with taking control of 5353, were unable to do so. Pakistani troops, detecting Indian activity at 5240, retaliated at point 5353 and by November 1999, established themselves at the peak. Subsequently, they put up concrete bunkers on the peak and constructed a road linking the base of the peak to Benazir Post. Swami believed that the Indian Army then attempted to force a territorial swap by taking positions on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control. But, despite some fierce fighting, these attempts did not succeed. Swami concluded by noting that \\"the end of the conflict is...not quite yet in sight.\\" Swami also claimed in his report that besides Points 4875 and 4251, the Indian troops also captured Point 5310 in retaliation, situated one kilometre inside the Pakistani side of the LoC. The then Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Nirmal Chander Vij responded with a press release giving \\"elaborate notes and maps\\" and asserting that \\"in accordance with the Simla Agreement the LoC passes through Point 5353. This point was never under our control either before or after Operation Vijay in Kargil.\\" However, Praveen Swami stood by his report, stating that The Hindu had in its possession copies of the army maps as well as orders issued to the commanders to capture Point 5353. The Times of India quoted Indian Army officers saying that the Line of Control in the area follows an \\"imaginary line\\" connecting high points such as Points 5070, 5353, 5245 and 5608. It was said that the Indian forces control the highest one, Point 5608, whereas the Pakistanis control Point 5353, because that is what the terrain allows. They believed that the tactical advantage to Pakistan from controlling the point 5353 is minimal. On 28 August 2000, The Hindu reported that the Indian troops captured Point 5070 in the vicinity to neutralise the Pakistani edge in the area. = Ram Kumar Anand's allegations = At a press conference on 30 August 2000, an opposition party leader, Ram Kumar Anand, alleged that besides Point 5353, which, he said was 300 to 500 metres inside the Indian territory, Pakistan was still in occupation of five other peaks in Kargil on the Indian side along the LoC. He supplied reporters with several documents to challenge the Indian Army's claim that Point 5353 was never in Indian possession. He claimed that India stationed army personnel on Point 5353 in 1992‚Äì93, who then cut off the supply routes of the Pakistani positions along the Line of Control. He reported that the Indian Army then said, the Point 5353 is \\"within our LoC and that we have every right to patrol the area.\\" He also claimed that an Indian Army platoon, led by Major Navneet Mehta had tried to recapture the peak on 18 May 1999 but the attempt had failed. He demanded that \\"a fact- finding team of five Parliamentarians should be constituted to go to the LoC to verify the facts.\\" Pakistan, the very next day, on 31 August, denied the allegations. BBC News quoted Pakistan's Foreign Ministry's spokesman as saying that \\"Pakistan respected the Line of Control (LoC) with India\\" and its troops had not violated the ceasefire line. The BBC news report noted that Anand's claim \\"followed a report in an Indian newspaper that a strategic peak, Point 5353, was under Pakistani occupation.\\" In response to Anand's allegations, Indian defence ministry on 1 September 2000 issued a press release that stated: \\"It is clarified that Point 5353 is on the line of control and not inside the territory under India's control\\" and \\"the controversy being raked up on this issue is based on distorted facts as borne out from maps of delineation between India and Pakistan in 1972.\\" It further stated that \\"the ground situation is well-known to the government and India‚Äôs posture along the LoC is militarily sound with an edge over the other side\\", adding that \\"the latest controversy appears to be motivated and is harmful to India's security interest.\\" Ashok Mehta said that in the encounter with RK Anand, the Indian Army was \\"forced to reveal certain information, which in national interest should have remained under wraps\\", adding that \\"Pakistan was prompt to report that it had not violated the Line of Control in Kargil.\\" General Ved Prakash Malik, Indian Army Chief of Staff during the Kargil war, in his book Kargil: From Surprise to Victory provides the rebuttal to Anand's allegations: > In August 2000, an opposition party leader held a press conference and, > without ascertaining facts from the Army, claimed that Pakistan was > continuing to occupy six peaks on our side of the LoC in Kargil. The Army > was once again brought into this political crossfire. It was alleged that > the Army had not disclosed the true facts. There were several critical > reports in the media the next day.

In this > column, he not only apologized but also condemned political leaders tending > to denigrate the Army by making unverified statements. = Operation Parakram = The Point 5353 controversy erupted once again during \\"Operation Parakram\\" (India's Code name for its military mobilization along the India‚ÄìPakistan border) which began on 13 December 2001, in response to the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. By this time the area north and east of Zojila Pass, including Leh, came under the newly raised XIV Corps. In August 2002, The Hindu correspondent Praveen Swami reported that Pakistani troops had occupied Point 5070 in the early summer of 2002, and in July, \\"after eight weeks of steady skirmishes, India reoccupied Point 5070 in the Dras sector.\\" He further said: \\"Point 5070, named for its altitude in metres, dominates the strategically vital Mushkoh nullah in the Dras sub-sector.\\" The Telegraph of 27 August 2002, reported that \\"In a map shown to The Telegraph today at the army headquarters, Point 5353 is depicted on the Line of Control, at an aerial distance of about 12 km from Dras\\", and a battalion of the Pakistan Army's Baloch Regiment was in possession of the peak, which it said was flanked on either side (east and west) by a battalion each of Northern Light Infantry and Punjab Regiment, supported by the Pakistani brigade headquarters at Gultari. It further reported that \\"A spur of the hill feature is connected to Pakistan's Benazir Post. Point 5353 is on the Marpo La ridgeline that runs on or parallel to the Line of Control. Other spurs of the peak run south into the Dras sector. To its immediate south is Tiger Hill and the Mushkoh Valley. In 1999, Pakistani intruders occupying the heights in this sector were directing artillery fire on Dras and National Highway 1A and were alleged to have planned to secure routes for infiltration into the Valley.\\" The newspaper quoted army officers as saying that, \\"There are heights from which we have a view of the PoK side and there are heights from where they have a view of our side. Besides, air observation posts (artillery observers on aircraft) can also mount a watch to direct fire. The view from Point 5353 does not seriously threaten our supply lines.\\" It also quoted the then Indian Defence Minister, George Fernandes, as saying in 1999 that \\"5353 is the point over which the Line of Control goes. The fact is our troops never occupied it. The normal practice has been that where the line goes over a peak, nobody occupies it.\\" Nonetheless, it noted that \\"even if Fernandes is taken at his word, the continued occupation of Point 5353 by the Baluch battalion means that Pakistan has departed from ‚Äúnormal practice‚Äù.\\" Ashok Mehta, in his article in The Tribune, said, \\"Parakram had opened a window of opportunity in the Kargil sector for the new 14 Corps to complete the Army's unfinished agenda for the Kargil war: seize Point 5353. While throughout April and May 2002, Point 5353 was pulverised with metal from Bofors guns, sometimes 10,000 rounds a day, Concourse missiles, cargo ammunition and air defence guns in direct fire, by May-end, Point 5070, a pivotal feature about 10 km west of Point 5353, was quietly seized in a brilliant stealth operation. The post was named Balwan after the Jat regiment that took it. Balwan had turned the flank of Pakistani defences in the Dras sector. The Indian Army now had a grand view and domination of the Gultari valley through which Pakistani posts are maintained in Dras.\\" The surprise loss of Point 5070 drew furious reaction from Pakistan Army, who used to occupy this peak during summer. The Pakistani troops launched several counter-attacks, in which the Indians suffered heavy casualties, but failed to retake Point 5070. Consequently, an enraged General Pervez Musharraf removed entire Pakistani chain of command, including the Pakistani Brigade Commander and GOC of the Northern Areas for losing this peak. Subsequently, a new Commander of the Northern Areas was appointed. On 10 June 2002, an Indian Army patrol managed to make their way to Point 5353, where they found several wounded Pakistani soldiers crying for help. Afterwards, the date of the attack on Point 5353 was fixed for 17 June. The then Indian Army's northern area commander, Lieutenant general R.K. Nanavaty went to New Delhi with the final plan and for the green signal. Richard Armitage, then American Deputy Secretary of State had arrived in Delhi a few days earlier, where he had revealed General Musharraf's pledge, in his words: \\"To end cross-border terrorism permanently, visibly, irreversibly and to the satisfaction of India.\\" Hence, George Fernandes, then India's defence minister denied permission to General Nanavaty to attack Point 5353 and thus the attack was called off. = Other views = After the war ended, the Indian and Pakistani local military commanders agreed to a plan to vacate Points 5353, 5240 and 5165 through which passed the Line of Control. According to Ashok K. Mehta, a retired Major general in the Indian Army and a columnist on defence and security affairs, \\"None of these was ever with the Indian Army. Nor were these at the time in Pakistani possession.\\" In late October 1999, units of 8 Mountain Division of the Indian Army captured Point 5240. They subsequently captured Point 5165 as well apparently to forestall their capture by Pakistanis. According to Ashok Mehta, \\"Taking Points 5240 and 5165 was not difficult, keeping them was tough. The mystery was over not taking Point 5353. It appears the unit asked to do so said it was impossible to get there. But Pakistan had breached the local commanders' agreement and turned Point 5353 into a rope-maintained permanent post.\\" In his book Kargil: Turning the Tide Lieutenant general Mohinder Puri, PVSM, UYSM, who was the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 8 Mountain Division during the Kargil War states, > A lot of controversy was generated on the status of Pt 5353 after the war. > This feature lies on the Pakistan side and to capture it, the attacking > troops have to approach from the north entailing crossing the LC.

With this event the war ended in the > Mushkoh‚ÄìDrass sector. General Malik, in an interview to Rediff.com on July 27, 2001, when asked about to \\"clarify the controversy about Point 5353, which has reportedly been taken over by Pakistan?\\", said: \\"That is not true. The 1972 letter clearly shows, both on the map and in writing, that the LoC passes through 5353. Some of the Point's features are occupied by them and some by us. But the fact is that if you want to attack Point 5353, you would have to come via the Pakistani side. It is not with us. We had never occupied it. Point 5353 had been vacated by them for a while when the talks were going on. Then they reoccupied it, that's all. I don't know how this controversy started. But I saw the hand-sketched map in which somebody had put 5353 right next to Tiger Hill. That is wrong!\\" Praveen Swami wrote on 10 March 2004: > When Operation Parakram began a little over three years ago, both the Indian > Army and the Pakistan Army began trading ferocious artillery fire up and > down the LoC.

The Hell's Hollow area has a wide array of wildflowers and habitats, in addition to what is seen in the gorge area of Slippery Rock Creek. One of the many trails leads to a cascading waterfall and one of the two remaining iron furnaces in the area. The Lawrence Furnace was constructed about 1864 against and in a cliff to take advantage of the natural ramp for charging the furnace. The Wilroy Iron Furnace, built in 1854, and one of the best preserved in Western Pennsylvania is located just north of McConnell's Mill State Park on private land (Rose Point). History McConnell's Mill State Park was formally dedicated as a State Park in October 1957 and became a National Natural Landmark in May 1974. The striking scenery and deep gorge of the Slippery Rock Creek, flowing through the park, is attributed to the glaciation of the area several tens of thousands of years ago. The southernmost extent of the Wisconsin Ice Sheet dammed up Muddy Creek and Slippery Rock Creek, creating a lake system. As the ice melted, glacial Lake Arthur drained into Slippery Rock valley. As the ice dam receded, this spectacular gorge was cut to a depth of 122 meters (400 ft) through an otherwise rolling countryside, and large house-sized sandstone boulders slid part way down the gorge. The creation of this gorge reversed the natural drainage patterns changing the flow of the water from the St. Lawrence River to the Ohio River watershed. In 1868, Daniel Kennedy rebuilt his original mill, which was destroyed by fire. Thomas McConnell bought that mill in 1875 and improved it by replacing the water wheel with water turbines and the grinding stones with rolling mills. The mill, one of the first rolling mills in the country, processed corn, oats and buckwheat for local customers. The mill operated until 1928 when sagging profits and advanced technology caught up with it. The mill and the surrounding property was conveyed from the McConnell family to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and later to the Commonwealth with the wishes that they be preserved for future generations. Nearby attractions The covered bridge in the park, property of Lawrence County, is a Howe truss bridge, built in 1874. The bridge is covered primarily to protect the inner structures from rotting and rusting away which cut down on maintenance. It is one of only two covered bridges in the county. The Cleland Rock area provides a scenic vista of the Slippery Rock Gorge, which is unique to the area.Office of Resources Management; Bureau of State Parks P.O.

Vagant.no publishes web-articles on a weekly basis, while the paper edition is released 4 times a year. Vagant is a member of the European cultural journal network Eurozine. Vagant played an important role for the generation of Norwegian writers making their debut in the nineties, such as Ingvild Burkey, Karl Ove Knausgaard, P√•l Norheim, and Linn Ullmann. History The journal takes its name from the Norwegian word Vaganterne, which comes from the Latin clerici vagantes which describes a group of wandering students from the middle ages, who performed under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman, and often their poems provoked the strict moral system of the church. With its first publication in 1988, Vagant established itself as an independent journal in Oslo. Among the editors of the first couple of volumes were Torunn Borge, Alf van der Hagen, Henning Hagerup, P√•l Norheim, and Linn Ullmann. In 1999 a parallel editorial group was established in Bergen, and each of the two editorial groups published two editions a year. In 2002 the Oslo office was shut down and for the next ten years the editorial office was located in Bergen. In 2013 the editorial office moved to Berlin. Since 2007 Audun Lindholm has been the chief editor of Vagant. From 1996 to 2005 Vagant received economical support from the Norwegian publishing house Aschehoug. In 2005 Aschehoug terminated the collaboration and the journal found a new sponsor in N.W. Damm & S√∏n. A few years later Vagant was integrated into the new publishing house Cappelen Damm. In October 2016 it was announced that Vagant would become its own publisher from January 2017 on. In 2009 the Internet initiative ‚ÄúVagant Europa‚Äù was established, with an intention to publish and translate significant articles from the European literary and cultural debate. In 2013 Vagant was chosen as the Norwegian journal of the year by Norsk Tidsskriftforening and in 2014 the magazine received the language prize Spr√•kprisen from the national institution Norsk Spr√•kr√•d, for having been a central force in Norwegian literature for the past 26 years, and, as the jury described it, for \\"its exemplary use of the Norwegian language\\". In April 2017 Vagant merged with the Danish journal Salon 55, which then became a part of Vagant, and the editorial staff announced a further commitment to connect the public spheres of the Nordic countries.

The magazine primarily focuses on science, technology, news, culture, and politics. It also publishes two podcasts, namely Wrongspeak and the eponymous podcast Quillette. It is associated with the intellectual dark web. Quillette was originally created in 2015 to focus on scientific topics, but has come to focus on coverage of political and cultural issues concerning freedom of speech and identity politics. Its editorial position was described in 2017 as \\"libertarian-leaning\\".  History  Quillette was launched in October 2015 in Sydney, Australia, by Claire Lehmann. It is named after the French word \\"quillette\\" which means a withy cutting planted so that it takes root‚Äîused here as a metaphor for an essay. Lehmann stated that Quillette was created with the aim of \\"setting up a space where we could critique the blank slate orthodoxy\\" ‚Äì a theory of human development which assumes individuals are largely products of nurture, not nature ‚Äì but that it \\"naturally evolved into a place where people critique other aspects of what they see as left-wing orthodoxy\\". Politico called Quillette the \\"unofficial digest\\" of the intellectual dark web. Writing for The New York Times, Bari Weiss called Claire Lehmann a member of the intellectual dark web. In August 2017, Quillette published an article written by four academics in support of James Damore's \\"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\\" memo. Quillette website was temporarily disabled. According to Lehmann, this was caused by a DDoS attack after publishing the piece. In a profile of Quillette, Politico reported that Lehmann knew about the grievance studies affair before it was first reported in October 2018, and was part of planning how to \\"fan the flames\\" of that controversy with the magazine's subsequent story defending the hoax. In May 2019, Quillette published an article by Eoin Lenihan that alleged connections between antifa activists and national-level reporters who cover the far-right. According to Shane Burley and Alexander Reid Ross, they and a number of other journalists received death threats after the claims were published. In August 2019, Quillette published a hoax article titled \\"DSA Is Doomed\\" that was submitted to them by an anonymous writer claiming to be a construction worker named Archie Carter who was critical of the organisation Democratic Socialists of America. The magazine retracted the article after the hoax was brought to their attention. According to socialist magazine Jacobin, the hoax brought Quillette fact-checking and editorial standards into question.  Reception  In an article for The Outline, writer Gaby Del Valle classifies Quillette as \\"libertarian-leaning\\", \\"academia-focused\\" and \\"a hub for reactionary thought.\\" In the Seattle newspaper The Stranger, Katie Herzog writes that it has won praise \\"from both Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins\\" adding that \\"most of the contributors are academics but the site reads more like a well researched opinion section than an academic journal.\\" In an opinion piece for USA Today, columnist Cathy Young describes Quillette as \\"libertarian-leaning\\". An article in Vice described Quillette as a \\"libertarian magazine\\". Writing for The Guardian, Jason Wilson describes Quillette as \\"a website obsessed with the alleged war on free speech on campus\\". Writing for The Washington Post, Aaron Hanlon describes Quillette as a \\"magazine obsessed with the evils of 'critical theory' and postmodernism\\". Writing for New Yorks column The Daily Intelligencer Andrew Sullivan describes Quillette as \\"refreshingly \\". In a piece for Slate, Daniel Engber suggested that while some of its output was \\"excellent and interesting\\", the average Quillette story \\"is dogmatic, repetitious, and a bore\\". He wrote that it describes \\"even modest harms inflicted via groupthink‚Äîe.g., dropped theater projects, flagging book sales, condemnatory tweets‚Äîas 'serious adversity'\\", arguing that various authors in Quillette engage in the same victim mentality that they attempt to criticise. In a Daily Beast article, Alex Leo described Quillette as \\"a site that fancies itself intellectually contrarian but mostly publishes right-wing talking points couched in grievance politics\\".  Podcasts  Quillette publishes two podcasts, including an eponymous podcast that began in 2018. A second podcast called Wrongspeak launched in May 2018. It is hosted by Quillette associate editor Jonathan Kay and Debra W. Soh. Wrongspeak is about \\"the things we believe to be true but cannot say\\".

Kai, who studied art in Europe, became a street artist at the age of 16. His work has been exhibited across Paris, Aspen, Miami, and Los Angeles, and integrates universal themes and values. He has partnered with professional athletes and musical artists on custom collections and group exhibitions. Early life and education Born in Los Angeles to a French-Tunisian father and Mexican- American mother, Kai Guetta goes by the pseudonym Kai. After high school he studied at the l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he learned about art disciplines and techniques and began to respect art as a way of life. Ka√Ø is widely known for his street art, which can be found in his hometown of Los Angeles, across the United States and even, abroad. He also creates paintings and sculptures and limited edition collectibles. Career Ka√Ø's first piece to receive public attention was a street art mural of a Marlboro cigarette pack with the term ‚ÄúMorons‚Äù replacing the brand‚Äôs name. During his teenage years, he continued to add graffiti pieces to surfaces in West Hollywood, typically with an anti-consumerism message. In 2012 he held his first solo exhibition at the Guetta Gallery in Los Angeles entitled Now Royalty, which consisted of paintings representing hip hop artists in medieval royal outfits and motifs. Prior to the creation of the twenty-seven paintings, he trained in Italy and Holland in order to study the work of the Flemish Masters. In all the collection took four years to create. In 2013 Ka√Ø debuted his solo exhibition Lost Values at the Lab Art Gallery in Los Angeles, in which he spoofs commercial imagery. In 2014 Kai took both of his exhibitions to Miami, in order to exhibit them at the Lulu Laboratorium. Pieces from the collection have since sold to public figures in the hip hop industry, including Lil Wayne and P. Diddy. In 2013 Ka√Ø held a guerilla solo exhibition in the Louvre-Rivoli station of the Paris metro. The exhibition featured sculptures of cigarette packets with ironic slogans similar to the pieces he first created in LA, and the Baroque-style oil paintings of hip hop icons from his Now Royalty collection. The exhibition was set-up before the station opened as it had not been officially authorized by the city. Each piece was arranged as if it were in a real gallery, with pedestals for the sculpture pieces and secured frames for the paintings. Some of the pieces parodied the work within the Louvre Museum specifically. In 2015 Ka√Ø began partnering with musical artist Chris Brown, under the pseudonym Konfused, to produce street art pieces under the label Konfuzed x Kai collection. The two spray-painted Porsche vehicles for Fine Art Auction Miami‚Äôs Urban Art Week, in addition to several other pieces. These pieces were then auctioned during the week. Seven pieces were created by the two in all over a three-day period. He has also partnered with NFL player Jarvis Landry for artwork in Wynwood, Miami. Kai and the Mayor of Le Touquet At the 2016 Art Basel Miami, Ka√Ø exhibited the installation piece Modern Relic, and later that year he exhibited cement plaques in the city of Le Touquet, France. In August 2017 Ka√Ø affixed eight cement-relief pieces on the exteriors of seven buildings in Aspen, Colorado, causing the city to consider citing him for trespassing and destruction of property after his methods were seen as possibly damaging to the heritage value of the sites. In addition to gallery work, Kai has produced street art in several American cities, including Los Angeles and New York City. In September 2017 Ka√Ø issue a limited edition serigraphy of \\"Love vs Money\\", one of his messages using the character IF (Imaginary Friend).

Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced former medical researcher and originator of the MMR autism hoax, and infectious disease specialist Peter Hotez, both describe TFVC's lobbying as very effective, with the rate of Texas students opting out of at least one vaccine at least doubling in around five years and over 50,000 Texas schoolchildren not being vaccinated. Background Texans for Vaccine Choice was founded in 2015 by a group of mothers, led by Jackie Schlegel, who opposed legislation proposed by state representative Jason Villalba (R-Dallas) which would have eliminated conscientious exemptions to vaccination requirements in the state of Texas. Referring to this bill, TFVC executive director Jackie Schlegel said, \\"This is Texas. We believe in parental rights in Texas. Like, that is just a fundamental belief that most Texans have that parents make decisions for their children, not the state.\\" The bill was never voted on. When he ran for re-election, Villalba faced opposition from TFVC as well as a primary challenger who ran a campaign largely based on the vaccine exemption issue. Villalba won, but stated that he believed opposition from TFVC reduced his margin of victory, and said, \\"I'm not interested in a suicide mission on this issue, I sense ‚Äî and this is unfortunate ‚Äî the only way a bill like this gets any traction is an even worse large-scale outbreak, between now and session. Short of that, I just don't think there is going to be the appetite to do this bill.\\" Texans for Vaccine Choice also helps parents apply for vaccine exemptions for their children, placing them at the epicenter of Travis County's rapidly growing anti-vaccination movement. TFVC is promoted alongside Andrew Wakefield in the anti-vaccination propaganda film Vaxxed. Political actions Terri Andrews of the Immunization Collaboration of Tarrant County, a Texas Medical Association member initiative, describes TFVC as the \\"main anti- vaccination group in Texas\\". Vaccine researcher Peter Hotez notes that moderate candidates in Texas are \\"being cherry-picked out by candidates running on anti-vaccine platforms\\". One example is the 2018 Texas statehouse election for district 114, where TFVC endorsed Lisa Luby Ryan, unseating the incumbent Republican in the primary. Ryan was beaten in the general election by Democrat John Turner. Science communicator David Gorski has criticized TFVC for publishing blog posts misrepresenting herd immunity, and accusing them of exaggerating the risks of vaccines and downplaying the benefits. Gorski has also criticized Jackie Schlegel for describing her autistic daughter as \\"vaccine injured\\", since there is compelling evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.

The building dates from 1824 but owes its current appearance to an adaption in 1868. A jailhouse wing projects from its rear side. History Pr√¶st√∏ was incorporated as a market town in 1403. After being hit by flooding, major fires and siege by invading Swedish troops, it had become a rather poor town with around 400 residents when the merchant H. C. Gr√∏nvold established a facility for salting herring and started a largescale export of grain in the early 19th century. Gr√∏nvold was also involved in the construction of the town hall in collaboration with the master carpenter Hans Andersen. The local baliff Jacob M√∏ller had previously sent in a rendering to Danske Kancelli and it had later been adjusted by Christian Frederik Hansen. The town hall was expanded with a jailhouse wing in 1850 and the town hall's facade on the square was adapted in 1868. The jailhouse was adapted for use as sloyd premises for the local school in the 1950s. The prison cells were used by the pupils for storing their works. The building was later used as storage space by Civilforsvaret and since the 1990s as storage space by the local theatre group. In the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, the market town of Pr√¶st√∏ was merged with the civil parishes of Allerslev, Beldringe, B√•rse, Jungshoved and Skibinge to form Pr√¶st√∏ Municipality. The town hall was decommissioned when Pr√¶st√∏ was merged into Vordingborg Municipality in 2007. In 2015, Vordingborg Municipality decided to sell the building. The buyer was Jakob Helles, the owner of a local real estate company. Architecture The jailhouse wing seen from the square M√∏ller's rendering was a copy of a rendering from 1803 made by the Viborg architect Willads Stilling for a new town hall in Nyk√∏bing Mors. It is unclear how much of the original design has survived since the rendering has been lost and no images from before the 1868 renovation exist. The gabled wall dormer above the main entrance dates from the renovation, and it is believed that all the other decorations on the facade do so as well. Today The building contains a restaurant on the ground floor.

Set in a reproduction of the Tower of London, it follows the story of Raven, an American special agent trying to steal and replace the Crown Jewels of England to safeguard them from a rogue operative. The player assumes the role of Raven and solves puzzles within the Tower while evading the guards. Progression through the game is nonlinear and under a time limit: the player may solve certain challenges in multiple ways, but must win before 12 hours elapse. Traitors Gate was conceived in 1996 by Daydream Software designer Nigel Papworth, who saw the Tower of London as a natural setting for a game. The team sought to replicate the structure with near-perfect accuracy and began by capturing over 5,000 reference photographs on location. Pre-rendering the game's panoramic environments challenged the team, which averaged seven members. The game took roughly three years to complete. Self-funded by Daydream after a successful initial public offering, Traitors Gate ultimately cost between $1- and $2-million, and by 2000 it was distributed in 10 languages and 27 countries by companies such as DreamCatcher Interactive and FX Interactive. The game was a commercial success and became Daydream Software's highest-selling title by 2003, with sales between 300,000 and 400,000 units worldwide. Many of these sales derived from North America and Spain; it failed commercially in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Critical reception of Traitors Gate was \\"mixed or average\\", according to review aggregation site Metacritic. Its puzzles and recreation of the Tower of London were lauded by many critics‚Äîthe latter was praised by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts‚Äîbut the title's bugs, pacing, large interface and use of mazes drew mixed reactions. In 2003, Traitors Gate was followed by the sequel Traitors Gate 2: Cypher, directed by Papworth and developed by 258 Productions. Gameplay and plot The player infiltrates the Queen's House in the Tower of London via a secret entrance. An interface containing the player's gadgets takes up the bottom half of the screen. Traitors Gate is a graphic adventure game that takes place from a first-person perspective in a pre-rendered visual environment. Using a point-and-click interface, the player explores a reproduction of the Tower of London and evades guards while solving puzzles, such as determining the combination to a safe by examining a coat of arms. In a manner that has been compared to Myst, player movement is restricted to jumps between panoramic static screens; the camera view can rotate freely on each screen. Traitors Gate features nonlinear progression: multiple solutions allow for roughly 1,200 unique pathways through the game. If the player does not win within the 12-hour limit, or is found by the guards, a game over results. In Traitors Gate, the player takes the role of a special agent named Raven, employed by an American agency called ORPHIA. At the start of the game, Raven's superiors believe that another ORPHIA operative plans to steal the British Crown Jewels from the Tower of London. Raven is subsequently tasked with infiltrating the Tower, secretly swapping the real jewels with forgeries and escaping without leaving behind evidence. These forgeries are equipped with hidden tracking units. The game begins in a broom closet within the White Tower, where Raven hides during a building tour to await night. Controlling Raven, the player then exits the closet and infiltrates the Tower. The player character is equipped with gear such as a crossbow, grappling hooks, lock picks, a motorized zip-line, explosives and tools to hijack security cameras. A PDA interface provides details about these gadgets, the Tower and other aspects of the mission. The player may also take photographs of the environment and message them to Raven's superiors, who send back facts about the objects in view. Traitors Gate features multiple endings based on the player's actions throughout the game. At the game's conclusion, after the Crown Jewels have been replaced, the President of the United States is informed that Raven's mission was a success. Development =Origins= The Traitors Gate team began by capturing more than 5,000 reference photographs on-site at the Tower of London. Traitors Gate was conceived in November 1996, when designer Nigel Papworth of Sweden's Daydream Software began to explore possibilities for the company's next title after Safecracker. Coming across an article about the Tower of London in an issue of National Geographic, Papworth realized that the structure contained \\"everything a good game needed\\", including a cleanly circumscribed playing area and an obvious gameplay objective. He and the team subsequently developed a game concept that would take place inside an accurate reproduction of the Tower. Their plan was to capture \\"the feel of the weathered stonework and mixed architectural styles with as near to photographic quality as time and technology would allow\\", and they hoped to make a game that entertained players while informing them about the real-world Tower. The decision to make the protagonist an American agent came early, as the country's alliance with Britain precluded violent gameplay approaches by the player and shifted the focus to stealth and puzzle-solving. Inspiration for the plot derived from the film series Mission: Impossible and James Bond. Daydream went public on the Stockholm Stock Exchange's Stockholm B√∂rsinformation (SBI) list in January 1997, with the plan for Traitors Gate prepared. The company's goal was to increase its economic and decision-making freedom, and to secure the ability to select a publisher at the end of each game's development rather than at the beginning. President Jan Phersson-Broburg argued that self-funding Daydream's future games with money from Swedish investors‚Äîinstead of opting for publisher financing \\"linked to specific projects\\"‚Äîwould offer the developer more stability, flexibility and room for growth. According to Papworth, Traitors Gate was part of Daydream's roadmap for the future after going public. In its November 1996 prospectus, the company had told investors that a game with the working title \\"Project II\\" was under development, with an estimated 18-month production cycle and 7-10 million kr budget. There were four competing \\"Project II\\" designs at that time. For Daydream's public launch, roughly 20 million kr worth of shares, or 45.5% of the company, were offered to investors in Sweden. The initial public offering was a success. As a result of this influx of capital, all subsequent development of Traitors Gate was self- funded. Daydream began Traitors Gate with around one year of research, starting with a trip of eight team members to the Tower of London to photograph the entire structure over two days. More than 5,000 images were captured during this trip. According to Daydream, employee Erik Phersson organized the results within \\"a series of indexed ring binders\\", on which the artists could base their work. Papworth later noted that, because the Tower of London held the copyright to photographs taken on its grounds, digitizing the team's images for use as texture maps was not an option. Instead, they used the pictures only for photo-referencing. Before full production of the game began, Papworth plotted its narrative in storyboard form, and Daydream planned the majority of Traitors Gates design on \\"a huge magnetic white board with a logic flow chart\\". According to lead programmer Peter Lundholm, HyperCard was used during pre-production to generate rough prototypes. In June 1997, Daydream reported that \\"Project II\\" was still in the prototyping stage and, pending a review of the finished prototype in August, would move into full production. This transition had been completed by September, and Daydream slated the result for 1998. By that time, the company had spent 1.85 million kr on the game. =Production= The Jewel House, containing the British Crown Jewels (pictured), was edited in Traitors Gate following security concerns from Tower of London management. In January 1998, Daydream Software announced \\"Project II\\" as Traitors Gate and scheduled its public unveiling for the following month, at the Milia festival in Cannes. Employment agency Octagon Entertainment, with which Daydream had signed after buying back Safecrackers rights from GT Interactive in November 1997, was set to begin locating distribution partners for Traitors Gate in February. Finished contracts were not forecast until May. As with Safecracker, the strategy was to work with a different local distributor in each territory. Jan Phersson-Broberg reported interest from distributors after Milia, but reiterated to investors that no deals would be signed before May, when a playable game demo was planned to appear at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). While the game was initially set for a late-1998 launch, by June of that year the release had been pushed back to early 1999. Distribution agreements remained pending after the game's E3 presentation. According to Nigel Papworth, development of Traitors Gate was \\"much more difficult\\" than originally expected, and a significantly greater challenge than Safecracker had been. The focus on reproducing the Tower of London left the team unable to alter the scope of the project, and forced Daydream to opt for realistic puzzles tied to the world, in comparison to the simpler task of designing Safecrackers more abstract puzzles. A nonlinear design approach was planned from the start, as Papworth noted that Daydream was \\"allergic\\" to linear gameplay, but this further increased the difficulty of Traitors Gates creation for the designers and programmers. The average team size was seven members throughout production, although other employees cycled in and out of the project as needed. Despite the focus on realism, the team modified sections of the Jewel House at the request of the Tower of London's management, who were concerned that the game's accuracy could pose a security risk for the building. The sewer system was also partly fictionalized, although influenced by real data and the actual positions of manhole covers. Daydream elected to use pre-rendered graphics instead of real-time 3D visuals on Traitors Gate because the team preferred an \\"above-standard graphics environment to the advantage of free 3D motion\\", according to Papworth. The slow pace of the game was a contributing factor to this decision, as Papworth noted that the \\"loss of a little mobility\\" did not hinder the design. Animated cutscene transitions between screens were added to increase player immersion, in hopes of making up for the lack of free movement. For the character animation, instead of using motion capture, first-time character animators Fredrik Johnson and Leif Holm worked manually. Ultimately, the decision to use pre-rendering brought the game's final size before data compression to 10 terabytes. Papworth later said that the production methods used in Traitors Gate were seen at Daydream as \\"too costly and time consuming to be a viable long term solution\\" for the company, which led it, including members of the Traitors Gate team, to make the concurrently-developed Clusterball. Five members of Daydream handled the creation of Traitors Gates models and textures. Modeling was initially delegated to Papworth, Holm, Johnson and Ulf Larsson. At roughly the 12-month mark, Papworth transitioned more fully into game design and writing, and his place on the modeling team was taken by Michael Nahal. The team began by drawing building plans on transparent vellum, based on information obtained from second-hand books, the Internet, the Royal Archives and Daydream's personal reference photographs. Working with Autodesk Maya and PowerAnimator 6.5, the team then created wire frames based on these plans, using four SGI O2 and SGI Indy computers. Textures were created in Painter, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, while the finished graphics were rendered on a farm of SGI Challenges and systems running Windows NT. Hardware upgrades were frequent during production. According to Papworth, the models and textures took two years of \\"60 hour weeks\\" to complete. The White Tower structure, delegated to Johnson, required nearly six months of labor by itself. Modeling the White Tower required nearly six months of work by artist Fredrik Johnson. Traitors Gate was built with Live Picture Inc.'s RealVR tool, software that displays virtual-reality photographic panoramas. Papworth explained that the techniques Daydream developed while working on Safecracker, a game created with QuickTime VR, had since been incorporated into the newer RealVR software suite. The decision to move to RealVR was heavily inspired by the software's ability to display spherical 360¬∞ panoramas, a necessity given the tall structures modeled in Traitors Gate. To construct the game's panoramic environments, Erik Phersson implemented image stitching with BBEdit and Live Picture's PhotoVista editing software, combining multiple rendered stills from the graphics team into larger images. The panoramas were made playable and interactive by Peter Lundholm, with the tools DeBabelizer and Macromedia Director. Phersson also handled Traitors Gates sound effects, added to the game environments with MacPaint and SoundEdit. The soundtrack was created by local musicians Toontrack, which comprised Mattias Eklund and Henrik Kjellberg. Their opportunity to join Traitors Gate came because Eklund had played in a band with Phersson and Leif Holm during the development of Safecracker. As that title's production wrapped, Toontrack spent a week on an eight-minute demo to pitch Daydream for its next game. Afterward, Phersson hired the pair to score an early build of Traitors Gate, and their involvement grew from there. Eklund and Kjellberg used the programs WaveLab and Cubase VST to compose Traitors Gates music, which was made with a combination of sampled, synthesized and live instrumentation. The pair relied on Oberheim Matrix 1000 and Yamaha A3000 synthesizers, a Yamaha AES1500 and a Roland GR-1 for the synthetic and live elements. The soundtrack was purposely limited in-game to build atmosphere, and, according to Toontrack, was written in the style of \\"sixties and seventies\\" spy films to match the theme of Traitors Gate. At the 1998 European Computer Trade Show (ECTS), Daydream landed distributors for Traitors Gate in eight countries. By the end of September, completion of the game was scheduled for fall; development costs had climbed to 8.06 million kr by late November. In January 1999, Daydream announced a release date of April, and confirmed K.E. Media as the game's distributor in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Deals with companies in France, Italy, Britain and the Netherlands were secured by February. However, as the year progressed, Traitors Gate encountered a four-month delay to fall 1999. This event was blamed by Daydream on numerous software bugs, caused by the game's \\"size and complexity\\". It proceeded to appear at E3 1999, and development costs rose to 10.6 million kr by the end of May, with 2.03 million of this figure depreciated through capitalization. Papworth estimated the final budget for Traitors Gate as between $1 and $2 million in United States currency. Following the public launch of Traitors Gates demo in June 1999, Daydream brought the game to gold status late that July. =Release= Traitors Gate was first released in early September 1999, after roughly three years of development. It was shipped on four CD-ROMs. By the end of its debut month, the game had launched in seven countries: Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, England and the Netherlands. Daydream Software told investors on September 30 that Traitors Gate would appear in another 14 countries by March 2000. Further launches occurred in New Zealand and Australia on October 31, through Hilad Corporation; in France on November 29, through √âditions Profil; and in Spain on December 16, through FX Interactive. It was the latter company's first published game. Traitors Gate had received translations into 10 languages by December 10, at which time Daydream reported its lifetime \\"guaranteed sales volume\\" as above 100,000 units. Before Traitors Gates release, Nigel Papworth noted his \\"hope that this title gets the crack it deserves at the American Market\\", following Safecrackers failure to penetrate the region. According to Papworth, North America's buying power was equivalent to the rest of the world's combined, and it was \\"seen as the paramount market to crack\\" for international developers at the time. In early November 1999, Daydream signed with publisher DreamCatcher Interactive to distribute the game in North America. As was typical, the deal was set up by Daydream's agency, Octagon Entertainment, based in North Carolina. Thanks to DreamCatcher's partnership network, Traitors Gate was initially set to appear in 15 North American retail chains, including Best Buy, Virgin Megastores and CompUSA. The game's availability was planned in nearly 2,000 individual stores across North America. It launched in the region on May 15, 2000. Traitors Gate had seen releases in 27 countries by April 28, 2000. At the time, Daydream announced new deals with distributors to release the game in Korea, Poland, Taiwan and Greece. The company reported sales forecasts of \\"approximately 15,000 games\\" for each of these regions. In June 2000, the game launched in the Tower of London gift shop, which made it the only video game available there at the time. Reception =Sales and distribution= Traitors Gate was commercially successful and became Daydream Software's top-selling game by 2003. It sold 48,000 units worldwide by the end of May 2000, and was a hit in Spain, which accounted for 22,000 sales by April 10. The game spent over three months in the top 10 of Spain's sales charts. However, it was a commercial failure in Germany, where it sold 4,000 copies; in the United Kingdom, which bought 3,000 units; and in Italy. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) traced Traitors Gates country-by- country success rate to the quality of Daydream's distribution partners in each region. By September 30, worldwide sales of the game had risen to roughly 120,000 copies. Daydream told investors that the jump from May came due to \\"increased marketing efforts by us and our distributors.\\" Writing for Adventure Gamers, Marek Bronstring noted that \\"slow\\" initial sales for Traitors Gate gave way to significant success, beginning around one year into its shelf life. September 2000 became the first-ever month that Daydream turned a net profit, in part thanks to the sales increase of Traitors Gate. The game surpassed 200,000 units sold globally by the end of March 2001 and reached close to 250,000 sales by June 30. That July, it topped 50,000 lifetime sales in Spain. According to the Eurofound, Traitors Gate was also successful in the United States, which the group wrote was \\"primarily because a huge supermarket chain\\" in the region had opted to stock it. It accounted for 14% of DreamCatcher Interactive's sales in 2000. This made it one of the publisher's top titles that year, behind Atlantis II and The Crystal Key. The following year, PC Data calculated the game's retail sales in North America at 52,573 units for 2001 alone. Globally, Traitors Gate sold more than 300,000 copies by March 2002. During the first six months of that year, PC Data tracked another 15,429 sales in North American retailers. By 2003, Traitors Gate had sold between 300,000 and 400,000 copies worldwide, of which Spain accounted for 75,000 units. According to DreamCatcher, the game totaled 245,000 lifetime sales in North America alone by early 2003. =Critical reviews= According to the review aggregation site Metacritic, critical reception of Traitors Gate was \\"mixed or average\\". The game was nominated for \\"The Design Award\\" at the 1999 British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), but lost the prize to Wipeout 3. The BAFTAs' judges called Traitors Gate a \\"very well researched and well considered game with intuitive game play\\", and praised its controls and its depiction of the Tower of London. It was also a finalist for GameSpots 2000 \\"Best Adventure Game\\" award, which ultimately went to The Longest Journey. Comparing the game to Spycraft: The Great Game, GameSpots Ron Dulin praised the puzzles in Traitors Gate, which he felt were sensible and realistic, alongside its detailed reproduction of the Tower of London. Despite encountering numerous technical problems with the software, he considered the overall product \\"very good\\", but short of outstanding. Cal Jones of PC Gaming World similarly praised the puzzles and visual detail, but noted a slight blurriness to the graphics and found the game brief despite its \\"nice covert feel\\". She ultimately gave it a moderate rating. By contrast, Tim Cant wrote in PC Gamer UK that Traitors Gate is a boring title, which contributes \\"nothing to an already-tedious genre\\". He condemned its puzzles, pace and control system, and summarized that playing it is \\"as much fun as being crapped on by crows, then beheaded.\\" Cant's complaints were echoed in PC Zone, whose writer Mark Hill called the game dull and dismissed its puzzles as \\"childish\\". Hill and Cant both strongly critiqued Traitors Gates graphics, which they considered bland and unengaging. Writing that the game's real \\"adventure is trying to keep your interest alive for more than five minutes\\", Hill gave Traitors Gate a \\"below average\\" rating. However, while David Ryan Hunt agreed in Computer Games Magazine that \\"too many flaws ... detract from the fun\\" in Traitors Gate, he sided with Dulin and Jones on the quality of the graphics and puzzles, which he felt were largely solid. Audrey Wells of Computer Gaming World continued Hunt's, Dulin's and Jones' praise for the puzzles, and again cited the visual representation of the Tower as a high point. Despite noting that the sewer maze portions of Traitors Gate make it \\"more suitable for experienced gamers\\", Wells enjoyed the game and did not criticize its use of mazes. Just Adventures Ray Ivey took an even stronger line of support for the game. In contrast to Hill's and Tim Cant's dismissals of Traitors Gate as boring, he labeled the proceedings \\"breathlessly exciting\\" and \\"indecently fun\\", and praised the mazes' execution outright. On this latter point, Hunt diverged sharply with both Ivey and Wells: he regarded these sections as the chief problem with Traitors Gate, as a detriment to the title's immersion and as \\"a potential game-killer\\" that limited Traitors Gate almost exclusively to hardcore genre fans. As a result, he summarized the game as a middling \\"experience [that] isn't likely to become something you‚Äôll cherish\\". Ivey and the writer for MacHome Journal both advanced Computer Gaming Worlds, GameSpots and PC Gaming Worlds praise for the recreation of the Tower of London in Traitors Gate, which MacHomes reviewer considered to be arguably its greatest strength. The writer noted that it had \\"been quite a while since an adventure of this nature has genuinely held my interest\\" like Traitors Gate. Similarly, David Wildgoose of PC PowerPlay dubbed Traitors Gate \\"a must for quality-starved adventure gamers\\". Like Hunt and Wells, both of whom had called the title \\"a refreshing change of pace\\" for adventure games, Wildgoose singled out its atypical theme for praise. He cited it as an unusually tense entry in its genre and highlighted its \\"genuinely clever and suspenseful design\\". At the same time, he found its pacing slow and awkward, and criticized the game for overwhelming the player with \\"too much information far too quickly\\" in its introduction of the utility gear. Like Mark Hill, he also disapproved of the large HUD. Following Wildgoose's criticism of the restrictions on player movement in Traitors Gate, the critic for MacHome noted that the game lacks \\"a sense of freedom\\", but nevertheless praised its nonlinear structure. Its bugs and ending sequence were the reviewer's primary dislikes. Sequel Based on its success with Traitors Gate in North America, publisher DreamCatcher Interactive commissioned a sequel, Traitors Gate 2: Cypher. Daydream Software told investors that a deal with \\"an internationally recognized publisher\\" to develop the game was reached in April 2002, and that it was funded ahead of time by this outside party. The project was scheduled for a 14-month development cycle. Traitors Gate 2 was ultimately developed by the company 258 Productions. Nigel Papworth, who conceived and designed the game at 258, said that he had been resistant to developing another title with pre-rendered visuals. Instead, he told DreamCatcher that he would work on the sequel \\"if you'll let me do it in real-time 3D.\\" He felt that graphics technology had advanced enough to make this leap, and that the switch offered him \\"a huge amount of freedom for the gameplay.\\" As a result, the team licensed the Gamebryo engine to create Traitors Gate 2. By June 2002, the game was set for a September 2003 release. Inspired by his \\"reading an article on cryptography technique at the same time as a book on Babylonian history\\", Papworth combined these two ideas to create the game concept for Traitors Gate 2. First announced as Cypher: The Sequel to Traitors Gate in April 2003, Traitors Gate 2 casts the player again as Raven, who now seeks to thwart the plot of Middle Eastern terrorists and a treacherous American agent. It was released in November 2003 to \\"generally negative reviews\\", according to Metacritic.

History Bear was granted a privateering commission in September 1684 by Governor William Stapleton of Nevis, which he used to attack Spanish ships despite the commission only giving him leave to attack Indians and pirates. The Dutch Governor of Curacao in January 1685 ordered Bear tried for capturing a Spanish ship while the Dutch were at peace with Spain, which Bear avoided. However, in April 1686 Bear led a raid on Tortola, capturing slaves and abusing Dutch and English prisoners. As a result, the Dutch abandoned Tortola's fledgling colony. That July Stapleton renewed Bear's commission when Bear appeared in a different ship, claiming his former sloop was leaking which forced them to transfer to the frigate James. Stapleton confirmed Bear's capture of the Spanish ship La Soldad in October; Bear claimed he had been searching for the ship that assaulted Tortola when La Soldad attacked him. Captain St. Loe of HMS Dartmouth, the Royal Navy warship on station at Nevis, complained at length about Stapleton and Nevis' Deputy Governor Russell (\\"a great favourer of privateers\\"), who went out of their way to enable and protect Bear's piracies. In turn Russell complained of St. Loe: \\"His insolence to me, and his abuses to all Deputy-Governors and Councils of these Islands want a better pen than mine to describe\\". Governor Molesworth of Jamaica wrote in August 1687 that Bear had turned pirate, openly attacking English ships. Bear had transferred his allegiance to Spain, marrying a supposed noblewoman in Havana with much celebration. Molesworth was not fooled: \\"The nobleman's daughter is a strumpet that he used to carry with him in man's apparel, and is the daughter of a rum-punch-woman of Port Royal\\". Bear apparently had kept his soon-to-be wife aboard his ship, dressed in men's clothes. Under Spanish colors he sailed as a guarda costa privateer, patrolling from Havana and Puerto Rico. Molesworth dispatched HMS Guernsey \\"to demand the surrender of the pirate Bear, or failing that, to seek him out and destroy him\\", though the Spanish would not give him up. Bear was still there by February 1688, and may have moved to Vera Cruz that May where he and others had captured at least six more English vessels. A rescued English prisoner claimed that after Bear swore allegiance to Spain his English crewmen refused to sail with him; Bear then took aboard a Spanish crew and threatened the Englishmen that they had to sail with him or face prison. The Spanish plundered Santo Domingo and Anguilla in March 1689, again led by Bear. After England allied with Spain thanks to King William's War, Bear continued to hunt English ships, having sailed to Petit Goave to take a French commission from the Comte de Blenac. In French service he turned against his former Spanish sponsors, joining with Jean-Baptiste du Casse for a time, then sailing to France where he received a fresh commission before returning to the Caribbean and sacking Caracas.

After premiering at the Catalina Film Festival on 2 October 2016, the film had an \\"on demand theatrical run\\" via Gathr, after which it became available on VOD platforms on 10 January 2017. The film is currently available to Netflix subscribers, as a digital download on iTunes or as a physical DVD via Amazon. The film, produced by Myla Films and directed/narrated by Kohl Harrington, was distributed by Gravitas Ventures.  Synopsis  Dog food for sale at a New Hampshire supermarket. The film begins with, and shows at points throughout, montages of pet food labels from different brands, such as Milk-Bone and Meow Mix. The documentary promotes raw feeding, and criticizes all kibble brands, even ones considered \\"organic\\" or \\"natural\\". The film also criticizes the fact that pet food manufacturers use the same factories for different brands, thereby potentially misleading consumers that different companies were behind the production of the pet food. According to the documentary, as of 2013, there were only five pet food manufacturers in the United States: Mars Corporation (manufacturer of Royal Canin, Whiskas, and Pedigree, among others), Nestl√© Purina PetCare, Procter & Gamble, Hill's Pet Nutrition (manufacturer of the Science Diet), and The J. M. Smucker Company (formerly Big Heart Pet Brands, manufacturer of Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, among others). In 2014, however, Mars Corporation purchased Procter & Gamble's pet food brands (IAMS, Eukanuba and Natura) from the company, meaning that today there are only four manufacturers. The documentary showed interviews with several veterinarians who advocate raw feeding, such as Dr. Karen Shaw Becker and Dr. Barbara Royal, and it recounted previous pet food scares, such as the 2007 pet food recalls and the 2013 chicken jerky recall. Some veterinary professionals interviewed in the film link modern ailments found in pets, such as obesity and allergies, to diet, and claim that changing that diet would eliminate those problems. Among those personally criticized are Dr. Melody Raasch, who has advocated corn as a healthful dog food in the past for IAMS. Other veterinarians disagreed, such as Dr. Annie Harvilicz, who in her interview said that she believed that bacteria and other pathogens in uncooked foods present a risk to pets. According to Dr. Becker, however, dogs frequently practice coprophagia with no ill effects, and dogs are evolutionarily equipped to be able to process any pathogens in raw food. The film also explains and criticizes the regulatory framework for pet food in the United States. Pet food and animal feed are not differentiated in the law, which means pets and livestock are in many cases legally the same. If a pet dies due to poisonous food, American courts only return judgments which give plaintiffs minimal amounts of money in light of how much they care for and pay for their pets. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates pet food labels, but the film criticizes the definitions used as misleading. For example, if a pet food has \\"dinner\\" on the label, it only need contain 25% meat; if the word \\"with\\" is used, as in \\"with beef\\", a pet food could be 97% grain or corn with only mandatory 3% beef. If the word \\"flavor\\" is used, as in \\"salmon flavor\\", the pet food need not contain any salmon at all, the only requirement is that there is enough of the ingredient \\"to be detected\\". Only foods specifically labeled with the words \\"cat food\\" and \\"dog food\\" need contain 95% or more meat. Reception Reception to the film was mostly positive; however, it did not have a large theater run and many major publications did not review it. CBS's Chicago affiliate responded positively to the documentary, and included tips on making the switch to raw feeding and recipes from Dr. Barbara Royal. The Daily Journal praised the film, describing it as \\"breaking down the facade\\" of the pet food industry. Hammer To Nail called the film a \\"powerful\\" documentary that \\"every pet owner needs to see\\". The Holmes County Times-Advertiser praised the film, writing \\"[Pet Fooled exposes] a poorly regulated industry driven more by profits and less by the wellbeing of animals.\\" Lindsay Beaton, writing for Pet Food Industry, a trade publication funded by the pet food industry, responded negatively to the film, claiming that while labels \\"can be...confusing and overwhelming\\", \\"the industry knows this and has been discussing the issue at great length for some time now\\". She also stated that the documentary did a poor job of \\"discussing any of the significant pet food safety changes that have come from those recalls in the decade since [the 2007 pet food recalls.]\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2016 films Category:Pet foods Category:Food safety scandals Category:Documentary films about food and drink ","title":"Pet Fooled"},{"id":"54945493","text":"The Giske Wildlife Sanctuary () is located in the Makkevika inlet on Giiske island in the municipality of Giske in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway.

The gated community is occupied by star athletes, socialites, and professionals. History Developer J. Robert \\"Bob\\" Sierra laid the groundwork for Avila in 1978. Surrounded by eight-foot walls, its name was inspired by the Spanish city of √Åvila that was itself protected by imposing walls. The vast majority of the current homes in Avila were built in the 1980s. The neighborhood was created with various dining options and its centerpiece, the Avila Golf and Country Club. Amenities include six tennis courts, a swimming pool and fitness center, and an 18-hole course redesigned by famed golfer Jack Nicklaus in 1988. PGA pros are on staff for private golf lessons. Avila was constructed with two entrances, one on Lake Magdalene Boulevard and another on North Florida Avenue. The neighborhood is guarded 24 hours a day and patrolled by security guards who use radar guns to monitor the speeds of vehicles. The security committee was once led by Tony Muniz, chairman of the Tampa Sports Authority. Geography Avila's boundaries are roughly Highway 41 to the west, Crenshaw Lake Road to the north, and Lake Magdalene Boulevard to the south. The community contains a dozen lakes, a conservation area, and oak, cypress, and pine trees. The only street exceeding a mile in length is Guisando de Avila, measuring 1.17 miles in length. Demographics As of 2010, Avila had a population of 2,626 with a median age of 53.6 years. Among the residents, 83.7% were born in America but only 39.3% were Florida natives. Nearly 83% of married-couple families contained two working parents and 13% of all households contained a single- mother. Economic data The 900-acre community contains 395 residences where homes typically sell for $600,000 to $5 million. As of 2015, the median household income was $72,594. The average household contained 2.6 people with 42% of residences containing a minimum of nine rooms. The neighborhood is zoned for the public institutions of Maniscalco Elementary School, Buchanan Middle School, and Gaither High School, but 47.6% of school-aged children attend private schools. Criminal Events =The Rivera murders= On January 9, 2012, retired doctor Hector Rivera (76) and his wife Debra (55) were murdered at their Avila residence shortly before 8:00 p.m. Hector's body was found in his driveway at 814 Taray De Avila while Debra's body was located in a bathroom within the mansion. The following day, Debra's personal assistant and driver Julian Ospina-Florez (31) was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder with theft noted as the motive. Ospina- Florez was found guilty on September 1, 2015, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole three days later. =The Campbell massacre= On the morning of May 7, 2014, Darrin Campbell (49) killed his wife Kimberly (51), his son Colin (18), and his daughter Megan (15), fatally shooting each in the head. The former executive at Pabst Brewing Company then attempted to cover up the crime by setting the $1 million mansion at 16223 Sierra De Avila on fire using gasoline and fireworks as an accelerant. He committed suicide as the house burned down, a home being leased by the Campbell family from former tennis professional James Blake.

The channel was owned by SPH MediaWorks, a subsidiary of Singapore Press Holdings. As a result of the media merger with Mediacorp, it shut down due to low ratings and lack of advertiser support. Its frequencies (terrestrial and cable) and channel space were taken over by okto (using Central's old format) nearly four years later. However, Okto itself later also closed down in 1 May 2019 due to similar reasons, after which the channel space created by TVWorks in 2001 folded and ceased to exist.  History  Logo used as TVWorks On 26 April 2001, SPH MediaWorks received a nationwide free-to-air television service licence from the Singapore Broadcasting Authority, allowing them to start broadcasting two channels, Channel U, a Chinese language channel, and TVWorks, an English channel. On 20 May 2001, TVWorks was launched. On 9 November 2001, TVWorks was restructured following a loss of 65 employees and a decreasing audience share. Plans for its shutdown were dismissed. On 25 February 2002, it was announced that the channel would rebrand as Channel i. This rebrand became effective on 3 March 2002. Under the new name, Channel i would put a strong emphasis on action entertainment and coverage of the S.League, as well as offering movies every evening.

Following World War II, it was the sole surviving O.T.O. organization.James R. Lewis Witchcraft Today, p. 217, ABC-CLIO, 1999 In 1942, jet fuel engineer Jack Parsons was appointed head of the lodge, and the organization was headquartered out of Parson's mansion in Pasadena. In 1946, Parsons lost a great deal of money in a business venture with L. Ron Hubbard and Sarah Northrup, resulting in him selling the mansion. In 1949, the Agape Lodge ceased to hold regular meetings. Background The original O.T.O. was founded by the wealthy German industrialist Carl Kellner. After Kellner's death in 1905, Theodor Reuss became Outer Head of the Order. After Reuss's death in 1923, Aleister Crowley was elected Head of the Order in 1925.Kaczynski, Richard. (2002). \\"Perdurabo, The Life of Aleister Crowley,\\" p. 332. New Falcon Publications In 1915, the lesser-known Agap√© Lodge No. 1 of Vancouver, B.C. had been established. Hollywood: 1935-1936 In 1935, Wilfred Talbot Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 2, based at his Hollywood home, and brought in seven initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935. Smith advertised the foundation of his group through an advert in American Astrology magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, as well as social events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936, the lodge held a Mass in honour of New Thought leader Wayne Walker who ran a group called \\"The Voice of Healing\\"; The Agape Lodge members hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later in 1936, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted. Hollywood: 1939- March 1940 Jack Parsons in 1938 In 1939, the group initiated Jack Parsons, a jet fuel engineer, and his wife Helen Parsons, who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass. Smith wrote to Crowley that Parsons was \\"a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable\\". The Parsons would help bring new members into the group Grady McMurtry and his fianc√©e Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister Sara Northrup. Grady McMurtry was an early Lodge member. He later became head of the O.T.O.. ; February 1939 In February 1939, a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered; although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story. Crowley appointed Karl Germer, a German Thelemite recently arrived in the US, to be his representative on the continent, and instructed Germer to oversee the payment of dues to himself. He also specified that it would now be Germer, and not Smith, who was his chosen successor. Kahl, who worked as a drama teacher, brought three of her interested students into the group, among them Phyllis Seckler, and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. The Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941. =Sarah Northrup joins, 1941= Sarah Northrup, younger sister of Helen Parsons Sarah Northrup joined the O.T.O. in 1941, at Parsons' urging, and was given the title of Soror [Sister] Cassap. She soon rose to the rank of a second degree member, or \\"Magician\\", of the O.T.O.Starr, p. 366 In June 1941, at the age of seventeen, Northrup began a passionate affair with Parsons while her sister Helen was away on vacation. She made a striking impression on the other lodgers. When Helen returned, she found Northrup wearing Helen's own clothes and calling herself Parsons' \\"new wife.\\" Such conduct was expressly permitted by the O.T.O., which followed Crowley's disdain of marriage as a \\"detestable institution\\" and accepted as commonplace the swapping of wives and partners between O.T.O. members.Pendle, p. 203. Although both were committed O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to conflict between the two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: \\"This is a fact that I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally ‚Äì we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me ‚Äì or support me as well.\\" Some years later, addressing himself as \\"You\\", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: \\"Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema.\\"Pendle, p. 204. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends. Northrup's hostility towards other members of the O.T.O. caused further tensions in the house, which Aleister Crowley heard about from communications from her housemates. He dubbed her \\"the alley-cat\\" after an unnamed mutual acquaintance told him that Parsons's attraction to her was like \\"a yellow pup bumming around with his snout glued to the rump of an alley-cat.\\" Concluding that she was a vampire, which he defined as \\"an elemental or demon in the form of a woman\\" who sought to \\"lure the Candidate to his destruction,\\" he warned that Northrup was a grave danger to Parsons and to the \\"Great Work\\" which the O.T.O. was carrying out in California.Starr, pp. 302‚Äì303 Similar concerns were expressed by other O.T.O. members. The O.T.O.'s US head, Karl Germer, labeled her \\"an ordeal sent by the gods\\". Her disruptive behavior appalled Fred Gwynn, a new O.T.O. member living in the commune at 1003 South Orange Avenue: \\"Betty went to almost fantastical lengths to disrupt the meetings [of the O.T.O.] that Jack did get together. If she could not break it up by making social engagements with key personnel she, and her gang, would go out to a bar and keep calling in asking for certain people to come to the telephone.\\"Pendle, p. 247 Relocation to Pasadena in June 1942  In June 1942, a number of other Thelemites moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden. Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article for an occultist fanzine: \\"In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms‚Äîany mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected\\". Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons' influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal Oriflamme, in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressedparticularly due to Parsons' descriptions of drug useand the project was soon shelved. Although there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema. He gave almost all of his salary to the O.T.O. while actively seeking out new membersincluding Formanand financially supported Crowley in London through Germer. Parsons had begun a relationship with Sara Northrup, while Smith consoled Helen, who would become his partner for the rest of his life; nevertheless the four remained friends. Although they had ceased to publicly perform the Gnostic Mass, membership of the lodge continued to grow. A number of prominent members however left, among them Regina Kahl and Phyllis Seckler. =Law enforcement concerns= Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the Pasadena Police Department and the FBI. Both had received allegations of a \\"black magic cult\\" involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire. Karl Germer, now leader of the North American O.T.O., was German. Neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security. =Parsons becomes head of the lodge = Crowley however had remained highly critical of Smith's leadership of the lodge, and ordered Wolfe to send him on a personal magical retreat; she felt conflicted, but eventually conceded to Crowley's demands. Both Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith ousted permanently, believing that he had become a bad influence on the other lodge members; many of the members, including Jack and Helen Parsons, wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed head of the lodge. In New York Jack Parsons met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America. In December 1941, Smith announced a policy that all Lodge members now had to contribute 5% of their earnings as an \\"Emergency Fee\\" that went to Crowley. In when, Smith suffered a mild heart attack. Smith retired at the age of 56 before undergoing an operation in February 1942. Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used cocaine, amphetamines, peyote, mescaline, and opiates as well. Parson continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry's fianc√©e Claire. When Parsons paid for her to have an abortion, McMurtry was angered and their friendship broke down. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons - who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict - ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked \\"Would to God you knew your people better.\\" Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members. =Parsons family= In April, Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was named Kwan Lanval Parsons. In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement. Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained sceptical. Helen was far less sanguine, writing in her diary of \\"the sore spot I carried where my heart should be\\", and had furious ‚Äì sometimes violent ‚Äì rows with both Parsons and Northrup. She began an affair with Wilfred Smith, Parsons' mentor in the O.T.O. and had a son in 1943 who bore Parsons' surname but who was almost certainly fathered by Smith. Northrup also became pregnant but had an abortion on April 1, 1943, arranged by Parsons and carried out by Dr. Zachary Taylor Malaby, a prominent Pasadena doctor and Democratic politician.Starr, p. 288 fn. 31 Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished. Arrival of L. Ron Hubbard in August 1945 L. Ron Hubbard in 1950 Around August 1945, L. Ron Hubbard visited 1003 South Orange Avenue at the behest of Lou Goldstone, a well-known science fiction illustrator who resided there.Miller, p. 116 Parsons took an immediate liking to Hubbard and invited him to stay in the house. Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had \\"no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. ... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.\\" Hubbard became Parsons' \\"magical partner\\" for a sex magic ritual involving that was intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess.Urban, p. 137 Hubbard soon began \\"affairs with one girl after another in the house.\\"Wright, p. 43 Ultimately, Nortrup became enamored with Hubbard. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard \\"living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when the two of them were sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible.\\" Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Parsons was deeply dismayed but tried to put a brave face on the situation, informing Aleister Crowley: Inspired by Crowley's novel Moonchild (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a \\"magical child\\" through immaculate conception, which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working's completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon. To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was \\"a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time\\" facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's √Üon of Horus. Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being \\"fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!\\" Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that \\"our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something‚Äîno matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result.\\" He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. One modern scholar speculates that the voices were a prank by Hubbard and Sara. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his \\"scribe\\", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, \\"Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement\\" while Hubbard \\"scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.\\" =Hubbard‚ÄìNorthrup‚ÄìParsons business venture of 1946= Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of \\"Allied Enterprises\\", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing.Miller, p. 120 Marjorie Cameron in the 1940s When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a preternatural entity psychographically provided him with Liber 49, which represented a fourth part of Crowley's The Book of the Law, the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the Book of Babalon. Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named Marjorie Cameron‚Äîan unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE‚Äîhad come to visit. Believing her to be the \\"elemental\\" woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his \\"Scarlet Woman\\", while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: \\"I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on.\\" Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon. Hubbard and Northrup aboard the schooner Blue Water II in Miami, Florida, June 1946. In April 1946, Hubbard and Northrup left for Florida, taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. Weeks passed without word from Hubbard. Louis Culling, another O.T.O. member, wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation: Crowley wrote to opine: \\"It seems to me on the information of our brethren in California that Parsons has got an illumination in which he has lost all his personal independence. From our brother's account he has given away both his girl and his money. Apparently it is the ordinary confidence trick.\\" Left \\"flat broke\\" by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a \\"weak fool\\" and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in County Causeway, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram containing an astrological, geomantic invocation of Bartzabela vengeful spirit of Mars. Parsons initially attempted to obtain redress through magical means, carrying out a \\"Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram\\" to curse Hubbard and Northrup. He credited it with causing the couple to abort an attempt to evade him: Parsons subsequently resorted to more conventional means of obtaining redress and sued the couple on July 1 in the Circuit Court for Dade County. His lawsuit accused Hubbard and Northrup of breaking the terms of their partnership, dissipating the assets and attempting to abscond. The case was settled out of court eleven days later, with Hubbard and Northrup agreeing to refund some of Parsons' money while keeping a yacht, the Harpoon, for themselves.Miller, p. 127 Northrup was able to dissuade Parsons from pressing his case by threatening to expose their past relationship, which had begun when she was under the legal age of consent.Pendle, p. 270 Hubbard's relationship with Northrup, while legal, had already caused alarm among those who knew him; Virginia Heinlein, the wife of the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein, regarded Hubbard as \\"a very sad case of post-war breakdown\\" and Northrup as his \\"latest Man-Eating Tigress\\".Wright, p. 48 Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to Margaret Grubb, bigamously married Sara and went on to found Dianetics and Scientology. End of the Agape lodge Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house. Parsons appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals. Agap√© Lodge continued in Southern California until 1949, after which the Lodge ceased to hold regular meetings.

History The Westerby Basset Hounds descend from the Walhampton Basset Hounds, founded in 1889 by Christopher and Godfrey Heseltine at Lymington in the New Forrest. In 1902, whilst Godfrey Heseltine was posted to India, the pack was sold to the Marquess Conyngham of Slane Castle in Ireland, and were known as the Slane Bassets, returning to the New Forrest upon Godrey‚Äôs return in 1910. Between 1915 and 1920, whilst Godfrey Heseltine served in the Great War and subsequently again in India, the pack was loaned to the Royal Naval Dockyard Rosyth and were known as the Rosyth Bassets, again returning to Godfrey who moved the pack to Lutterworth in Leicestershire, where the pack remained until his death in 1931. In 1932 the rump of the pack was purchased by Dr Eric Morrison who renamed the pack the Westerby Basset Hounds after the village of Smeeton Westerby. After World War II, due to the increased cultivation of arable land within the hunt‚Äôs county, a more active hound than a traditional basset was sought. After unsuccessful attempts at outcrosses with Welsh Hounds and Beagles, the now Colonel Morrison (after his World War II service) very successfully incorporated stud book Harrier blood into the pack, resulting in hounds with the same voice and nose, but less bone, shorter backs and shorter ears. The resulting hounds were the first of what was to be called the English Basset, a type of dog now used by a number of English Basset hound packs. More recently, further infusions with West Country Harriers, Beagles and pure Bassets have been incorporated into the type. Hunt country The Westerby Basset Hound‚Äôs country extends from Melton Mowbray in the north to Daventry in the south and Nuneaton in the west to Uppingham in the east. The country encompasses the whole of the Fernie Hunt‚Äôs country and parts of the Atherstone, Cottesmore and Pytchley Hunt‚Äôs countries.

He was born with the surname Tarkhadkar but he never used it in later life. He wrote extensively on religion and social reform as an opponent of rituals and caste, while supporting widow-remarriage and education for women. He was a brother of Atmaram Pandurang. Pandurang studied at a local school for four years before going to private high school followed by studies at the Bombay Native School and Book Society. He was a recipient of a West Scholarship and studied at what became the Elphinstone and he learned several languages including Portuguese, Persian and Sanskrit. In 1830 he became a school teacher and in 1840 he moved to Surat. The headmaster at this school in Surat was Henry Green, a noted agnostic and free thinker who influenced Pandurang. From 1846 he served as acting superintendent of vernacular schools and in 1852 he was selected for the post of Deputy Collector and Magistrate at Ahmednagar. He moved to Thana in 1858 and retired in 1861 due to troubles with superiors. Pandurang's major contribution was the grammar of Marathi. Maharastra Bhasheche Vyakaran published in 1836 that went into seven editions during his lifetime. He also published a supplement in 1881. Other publications included Yashoda Pandurangi (1865), Dharam Vivechan (1868), Paramhamsik Bramhadharma (1880), A Hindu Gentleman's Reflections respecting the works of Swedenborg (1878), The absurdity of the Holi Festival as it is now practised by the Hindus (1829), Shishubodh (posthumously published in 1884) and Vidhavasrumarjan (1857). He wrote Dharam Vivechan under the pen-name of Ek Jagadwasi Arya. Pandurang taught Sanskrit briefly at the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Zarthosti Madresa in 1871. In 1848, he founded and presided over the Upayukta Jnanprasarak Sabha, a students' literary and scientific society which met to discuss various topics every alternate Thursday.

One critic noted that Kennedy was ‚Äú...unafraid of asking uncomfortable questions about race and artistic pretension.‚Äù Biography From an early age, Kennedy was interested in letters and books and studied calligraphy for several years. At the age of 40, Kennedy visited Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia living history museum, and was mesmerized by an 18th-century print shop and book bindery demonstration. The incident so influenced that he studied printing at a community-based letterpress shop in Chicago and, within a year quit his AT&T; systems analyst job, which he had held for nearly two decades, to continue printmaking studies. Kennedy articulated his fascination with letterpress printing in one interview: ‚Äú... I believe it was the capability of making multiples. Multiples of text are important to me. They allow for distribution.‚Äù He attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studied under legendary book designer Walter Hamady, and earned an MFA in 1997. He later taught graphic design at the Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Arts at Indiana University. Technique Kennedy creates prints, posters and postcards from handset wood and metal type, oil-based inks, and eco-friendly and affordable chipboard. Many of the posters are inspired by proverbs, sayings, and quotes Kennedy locates or potential clients provide. Using hand presses, he ‚Äúproduces large editions of wildly colourful, typographically- driven posters on inexpensive chipboard stock, posters which are often so riotously layered with vibrant colours of ink as to retain a wet iridescence and tackiness years after they were printed. His working method often involves overprinting multiple layers of text ...resulting in no two prints being truly identical. Awards In 2015, Kennedy was honored as a United States Artists Glasgow Fellow in Crafts and received a $50,000 unrestricted prize. Collections * Kennedy & Sons Collection, Emory University, Stuart A.

It was circumscribed in 2014 by Chinese mycologists Bao-Kai Cui, Hai-Jiao Li, and Yu-Cheng Dai as a segregate genus from Datronia. Neodatronia fungi differ microscopically from Datronia by having moderately to frequently branched skeleto-binding hyphae in the context, and by their somewhat smaller spores. Description The fruit bodies of Neodatronia fungi are annual and crust-like. The pore surface colour ranges from white, to cream to pale brown. The pore surface, which becomes fragile when dries, consists of small pores with a round to angular shape. The subiculum is yellowish brown to cinnamon and has a corky texture. Neodatronia has a dimitic hyphal system (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae). The generative hyphae have clamp connections, while the skeletal hyphae are usually predominant, pale brown to brown, and moderately to frequently branched in subiculum and tramal. The branches of skeletal hyphae in the drama are typically well differentiated from the main part, and the tissues darken in the presence of a solution of KOH. Dendrohyphidia are present in the hymenium and the dissepiment edges. Cystidia are absent, but thin-walled cystidioles are usually present. The spores are cylindrical, hyaline, thin-walled, and smooth. Distribution and ecology The type species of Neodatronia, N. sinensis, is found in Anhui, while N. gaoligongensis is found in Yunnan. Both species cause a white rot on angiosperm wood.

Plot T-Bag is released from incarceration just as he receives a picture of Michael in a new prison. T-Bag shows it to Lincoln, who finds the hidden word \\"Ogygia\\", which is a prison in Sana'a, Yemen. Lincoln informs Sara, who has been raising her and Michael's son, Mike, along with her husband, Jacob. She refuses to believe the news.

Composition  The pianist Caroline Montigny-R√©maury had asked for a short piano and orchestra piece, but she never played the work that Franck composed in the summer of 1884. It was premiered 15 March 1885 by Louis Di√©mer as the pianist, in a concert at the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique. The work is inspired by the eponymous poem in Les Orientales by Victor Hugo. The latter often inspired Franck (melodies, and his first symphonic poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne, composed in 1847-1848, at the same time as the work by Franz Liszt from the same inspiration). Franck takes up the idea of the mysterious and supernatural forces tearing the nocturnal sky through their passage, and especially the singular rhythm of Hugo's poem, rising from calm into a sonorous storm, before falling back into the silence of the night. The piano part is very virtuosic, and Franck so liked Di√©mer's interpretation of this difficult score that he wrote his Variations symphoniques for Di√©mer, also for piano and orchestra, marking Franck's renewed interest in this instrument.

Its intention is to reinterpret five musical genres through audio and visuals: juke, hip hop, dubstep, electronic tropicalia, and what the press release labeled as \\"‚Äò90s Gregorian trance.\\" The main idea of the project regards what would happen if the \\"limitations\\" of a genre were bypassed or altered. The visuals for the tracks were produced by Tabor Robak, Sophia Al-Maria, Ryan Trecartin, Rhett LaRue, Kamau Patton, and production company Thunder Horse. The music videos premiered at New Museum on 21 October 2011, and the extended play itself was released by UNO Records on 25 October to favorable reviews from professional music journalists. A remix record titled GSX Remixes was released in May 2012 and features re-edits of tracks from Genre-Specific Xperience by acts such as Ikonika and DJ Rashad. Concept and composition The overall project of Genre-Specific Xperience intends to sonically and visually reinterpret five genres: juke house (\\"Corpcore\\"), hip hop (\\"Hip Hop Spa\\"), dubstep (\\"How Can I Resist U\\"), electronic tropicalia (‚ÄúD-Medley‚Äù), and what the press release labeled as \\"‚Äò90s Gregorian trance\\" (‚ÄúVatican Vibes‚Äù).

Hutchings said that the novel was dictated to her and medium Lola Hays from beyond the grave by the deceased Twain through use of a Ouija board.  History  The novel rose to fame when The New York Times ran a review of the book on September 9, 1917. The work was claimed to be authored by the spirit of late Mark Twain by two mediums, Emily Grant Hutchings and Lola V. Hays, with Hays being the passive recipient whose hands guided the Ouija board. Previously Hutchings tried to contact Patience Worth. The two mediums purported to have started transcribing the novel in 1915, and that it took Twain two years to complete. Due to the popularity of Ouija boards at the time, many Americans purchased the book and accepted Hutchings' claims at face value. = Copyright lawsuit = In an attempt to stop Hutchings from profiting from the Mark Twain's name, Clara Clemens filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court against Hutchings and her publisher Mitchell Kennerley on June 8 1918. Because Clemens and her publishers were unable to prove that the book was not written by the ghost of Twain, a lawsuit was filed to have Hutchings either admit the book was a fraud or surrender all profits to the Mark Twain estate and Harper & Brothers, who at the time had sole rights to the publication of Mark Twain stories. While Hutchings never retracted her claims, the lawsuit was eventually dropped when Hutchings agreed to destroy all existing copies and cease publication.

Career  From the age of 19, Cheriel started out creating record covers and T-shirts for the Oregon music scene. She was a member of the band Adickdid, which was distributed by several labels including Yoyo Records and Kill Rock Stars. She also played in the bands Juned, Teen Angels, and The Hindi Guns. In 2001, Cheriel, along with friends Kurt Voss and Zoe Poledouris, created the film \\"Down and Out With the Dolls.\\" This film is loosely based on Cheriel's life as a musician and the stories she would tell Voss about this time of her life. After this film was released, Cheriel moved to Los Angeles, California where she lives still. After moving to Los Angeles, Cheriel began work as a visual artist. She has created several paintings which continue on the themes she explored in her music, as well as exploring new ones. The main theme of her art, according to Cheriel, would be the attempts of people to connect to the world around them and to each other. Cheriel's interest in the relationship between man and our natural surroundings is apparent from the abundance of animals in her paintings. Cheriel uses these animals to depict human emotions.

He was a professor at Vanderbilt University and chaired its Department of Medicine from 1968 to 1983. Biography Liddle was born on June 27, 1921, in American Fork, Utah. He attended the University of Utah, graduating in 1943, before moving to California to attend the UCSF School of Medicine. After graduating in 1948, he became a research fellow at the National Institutes of Health Metabolic Research Unit. From 1953 to 1956, he worked as a surgeon for the Section on Clinical Endocrinology at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. He left to join the faculty of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine as chief of the school's Endocrine Service, and was appointed chairman of Vanderbilt's Department of Medicine in 1968. He held that role until 1983, when he had a stroke while driving and sustained numerous fractures from the crash. He died on June 29, 1989, in Nashville, Tennessee. Research Liddle published 223 research papers throughout his career. Much of his research focused on the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis and diseases that can affect it. He was the first to show that Cushing's disease was caused primarily by an abnormality in the anterior pituitary rather than the adrenal glands. He also described Liddle's syndrome, a genetic syndrome causing high blood pressure. Liddle developed the dexamethasone suppression test for assessing adrenal function and the metyrapone test for pituitary reserve. He discovered a method for measuring aldosterone levels in urine and pioneered the use of spironolactone in the treatment of high blood pressure. He also discovered that certain cancers, especially of the lungs, can secrete ACTH, producing a paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome. Based on his research into paraneoplastic syndromes, he coined the term \\"ectopic hormone secretion\\". Awards and honors Liddle was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1981. He received the Endocrine Society's Distinguished Leadership Award in 1971 and the American College of Physicians' John Phillips Memorial Award in 1977.

The pier underwent several renovations during the 1890s and early 1900s before being badly damaged by a storm in 1903, during which two barges collided with the structure and split it in two. A fire in 1928 resulted in extensive damage to the pavilion, which was not rebuilt, although the pier itself was reopened several months later. Following a period of decline it was closed to the public shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. The pier was demolished in 1960 despite the protests of thousands of local residents. Plans to rebuild the pier were discussed by local councillors in 2007, with the Lytham St Annes Civic Society opposed to any such plan and no further progress has been made since that initial proposal. History =Planning= Provision for a pier to be constructed for pleasure and as a boat-landing deck was first discussed during the early 1860s, leading to the formation of the Lytham Pier Company in 1861. Plans included visitor waiting rooms at the pier head and ornamental gates at the entrance, similar to those at Brighton's West Pier. Its construction began in 1864 with the screwing in of the first iron pile, a pre-planned event designed to ensure a suitably large number of visitors would be present to witness the occasion. The pier did not have unanimous local support; some residents believed that Lytham had insufficient regular visitors to make a pier financially viable, or that a high tide would too easily destroy the pier. =Construction= Lytham Pier Pavilion, opened in 1892 Despite some reservations, building work was completed a year after the first pile had been screwed in, at a cost of ¬£5890 (). The pier was opened by Lady Eleanor Clifton on Easter Monday, 17 April 1865. of iron were used in the construction of the pier. It was supported by 126 iron columns, apart and screwed into the solid clay base beneath the beach. A shelter was erected on the pier head's dock for passengers embarking or landing from steam vessels. The pier was capable of accommodating up to 5000 people, of whom 1000 could be seated. =Operation= Extension to Lytham Pier in 1901 The pier had a small renovation in 1892 when a floral hall pavilion was added half-way along the deck, at a cost of ¬£12,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). A further reconstruction followed in 1901‚Äì1902 to enlarge the pavilion, including raising the roof to accommodate taller stage scenery and enlargement of the theatre stage; other improvements included the erection of an additional dressing room, refreshment rooms and an upper tea-room added to the pavilion's balcony. The pier suffered significant damage from two separate incidents in 1903. The first occurred on 27 February, when two shelters were blown into the sea during a storm. Worse damage was caused later in the year on 6 October, when two barges driven by a gale-force wind collided with the pier despite the best efforts of the one-man crews on each boat; one caused significant damage to the central pier structure while the other got caught among the piers supporting the pavilion. Claims for compensation were made against Preston Corporation, who owned the barges, and after repairs had been undertaken the pier reopened at Easter 1904. During the early 1900s, George Kingston's Minstrels became an attraction on the pier and the beach, continuing through to 1910 on the pier and in the pavilion. Divers performed each season at the pier head in swimming displays, featuring Professor Stearne and Professor Payne. A Floral Hall opened in July 1911, occasionally playing host to orchestral concerts, as well as amateur dramatic societies. By the 1920s, the pavilion was showing films and this was its primary fare income from visitors. =Decline= By 1920 the pier was struggling to remain financially viable; JH Harrison, the manager of 32 years, stepped down the following year. The pavilion was destroyed by fire on 29 January 1928, which left behind a steelwork shell that was not rebuilt. The cause of the blaze remains unknown. The cost of the damage, covered by insurance, amounted to thousands of pounds, but there were no fatalities, as the on-site caretaker who lived on the pier had only just left his residence to sound the alarm before it was engulfed by the flames. Despite a proposal several months later to build a new pavilion at the pier's shore end, from a design prepared by St Anne's architect Arnold England, no work was carried out and the pier reopened on 24 May 1928 without a pavilion. The next ten years saw a plan by then owners Lytham Pier & Amusements Ltd to convert the pier into the shape of a ship, but it came to nothing. As its popularity dwindled, the pier closed to visitors in 1938 and it subsequently deteriorated throughout the mid-20th century, remaining in use by anglers only. The kiosks at the pier's entrance remained in use, but the council decided in 1959 that they were unwilling to provide the ¬£5000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) then required for the pier's restoration. It was subsequently demolished in March 1960 at a cost of ¬£7320 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) including ¬£4000 () in compensation to then owner Harry Kaniya, despite a petition opposed to the plan from local residents, which gathered almost 2600 signatures. Reconstruction proposals It was reported in May 2007 that local Conservative councillors were investigating the possibility of securing a grant to reconstruct the pier. Councillor Richard Fulford-Brown believes that if the circumstances regarding the pier's demolition were an issue today, it would be considerably more difficult to follow through with it and takes the view that a pier visitor attraction offers something interesting for residents and visitors alike. A similar suggestion had previously been made by a local architect, who proposed an eco- friendly boardwalk complete with a viewing station. As of 2007, Lytham St Annes Civic Society were opposed to any reconstruction proposal on the grounds that the town centre should be protected, especially as there are already piers in nearby St Annes-on-the-Sea and Blackpool (North and Central) respectively.

The tomb is most likely royal and dates to the mid-13th Dynasty, during the late Middle Kingdom. Finds from the area of the tomb indicate that S9 suffered extensive, state-sanctioned stone and grave robbing during the Second Intermediate Period, only a few decades after its construction, as well as during the later Roman and Coptic periods. Although no direct evidence was found to determine the tomb owner, strong indirect evidence suggest that the neighbouring and slightly smaller tomb S10 belongs to pharaoh Sobekhotep IV (fl. c. 1725 BC). Consequently, S9 has been tentatively attributed by the Egyptologist Josef W. Wegner to Sobekhotep IV's predecessor and brother, Neferhotep I (fl. c. 1735 BC). According to Wegner, the tomb might originally have been capped by a pyramid. Description =Location= Tomb S9 is part of a royal necropolis dating back to the late Middle Kingdom ‚Äì Second Intermediate Period, which is located immediately northeast of the causeway leading to the much bigger funerary complex of Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty, close to the ancient town of Wah-Sut and at the foot of the so-called Mountain of Anubis, a natural hill in the form of a pyramid. It was first summarily explored by √âmile Am√©lineau and subsequently excavated by Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie in 1901‚Äì1902. The tomb was covered in sand and proved to have been heavily disturbed, for example, the stone roof of the subterranean chambers had been plundered. =Layout= Plan of the substructures of the tomb S9 in Abydos as uncovered by the 1901‚Äî1902 excavations. Tomb S9 comprises the remains of a mudbrick inner enclosure wall, over in size, as well as a section of an outer whitewashed wavy wall in front of the northern side. There, lay a small rectangular chapel of which only one course of bricks survives, and beyond the entrance to the substructures. The overall layout of the tomb complex is very similar to that of the Southern Mazghuna pyramid. The substructures were dug into the hard sand, some below the surface, and lined with smooth limestone blocks. A passage leads to a quartzite portcullis, intended to stop tomb robbers from reaching the burial chamber. Beyond the portcullis was a stone-lined chamber in dimensions, the floor of which hid a further passage blocked by two portcullises, one of limestone and another of quartzite. Beyond, lies the burial chamber housing a massive sarcophagus built from three blocks of quartzite sandstone, roughly hewn on the outside, but well polished on the inside. The southern end of the burial chamber also had a recess meant to hold grave goods. Overall, the plan of the substructures of tomb S9 is similar to those found in the Pyramid of Khendjer. Small fragments of burned wood were uncovered there during the 1901 excavations suggest that the wooden coffin of the king was destroyed. Since then, burned bandages, small pieces of inscribed, gilded plaster from the king's mummy mask, and pieces of wood and faience inlay, stone jars, beads, and bone needles were unearthed in the substructures as well as in the rubbles of the enclosure wall. =Type= No traces of the superstructures once capping tomb S9 have survived and determining its type‚Äîmastaba or pyramid‚Äîremains difficult. Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie believed S9 was a mastaba, because of the enclosing wall which they thought would have held the sand packed on top of the substructures. However, the royal nature of S9 and S10 as well as their architectural similarities to pyramids of the late Middle Kingdom in the area of Memphis have led Wegner to suggest S9 might have been a pyramid too. In spite of these arguments, the Egyptologist Aidan Dodson asserts that it is still unclear whether S9 was a mastaba or a pyramid. Attribution Statue of Neferhotep I from a naos found in Karnak but possibly originating from S9. Excavations in 2003 and in 2014 made it very likely that this structure as well as the neighbouring one S10 were originally royal tombs. At the latter date, during excavations directed by Josef W. Wegner of the University of Pennsylvania, a fragment of a funerary tomb stela bearing a relief naming a king Sobek[hotep] was found inside the enclosure of tomb S10, on the eastern side of the complex, where a funerary temple might once have existed. In addition, fragments of wooden coffin inscribed for the same Sobekhotep were uncovered in later Second Intermediate Period tombs adjacent to S10. These fragments indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10. While in early press reports, published just after these discoveries, King Sobekhotep I was named as the possible owner of the tomb, further analyses now indicate that S10 might belong to Sobekhotep IV instead. Indeed, not only do the fragments of wooden coffin uncovered indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10, but its size means that its owner would have had to reign for long enough to complete it. This only leaves Sobekhotep III, IV, and VI as possibilities, with Sobekhotep IV being the most likely as he enjoyed the longest reign of these three kings. In addition, Sobekhotep IV is the only one of these kings for whom it is known with certainty that he undertook other works in Abydos. As a corollary, tomb S9 likely belongs to Sobekhotep IV's predecessor and brother, Neferhotep I. This is perhaps indirectly confirmed by the observation that both Sobekhotep IV and Neferhotep I are known to have been particularly active in Abydos.
