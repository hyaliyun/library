Larrabee (1830 ‚Äì December 19, 1906), also known as Hank Larrabee, was a 49er and a rancher in the Eel River Valley of Humboldt County, California notorious for his treatment of Indians. Subsequently he was a sheriff in Montana, a family man, businessman and school board member in Kansas. History He was born in Marion County, Ohio, son of Joseph and Lucy Larrabee and lived there until leaving for California during the 1849 California Gold Rush. He established a ranch at \\"Larrabee\\" in Humboldt County in 1859. He also owned the land around Blocksburg from the Eel River to Larabee Valley to the east. The town of Blocksburg was originally called \\"Larabee\\" or its other spelling \\"Laribee\\" Several landmarks ‚Äì including Larrabee Creek, Little Larrabee Creek, and Larrabee Valley \\\\- are named for him, although old maps and writings may use the alternate spelling \\"Laribee.\\" He was notorious as a killer of Indians, having once bragged that he killed more than 60 Indian children with a hatchet, and served as a corporal in the Volunteer Guides during the Bald Hills War. He is widely believed to have been an instigator and among the killers in the Indian Island massacre, who, besides Corporal Henry P. Larrabee include Sergeant Charles A.D. Huestis, Private George W. Huestis, Private Wallace M. Hagan and James D. Henry Brown. United States Army Lieutenant Daniel Lynn, sent to Larrabee Valley with a detachment in March 1861, described Larrabee to his superior, Captain Charles Lovell: :: \\"Here in this apparently lovely valley lived a man about whose qualities I feel myself impelled to speak. I heard no man speak in his favor, nor even intimate one redeeming trait in his character. The universal cry was against him. At the Thousand Acre Field and Iaqua Ranch even the woman who was shot and burned to death was condemned for living with such a man. Of most enormities of which he stands accused you are aware. An accomplice and actor in the massacre at Indian Island and South Bay; the murderer of Yo-keel-la- bah; recently engaged in killing unoffending Indians, his party, according to their own story, having killed eighteen at one time (eight bucks and ten squaws and children), and now at work imbruing his hands in the blood of slaughtered innocence. I do not think Mr. Larrabee can be too emphatically condemned.\\" An anonymous letter writer called attention to some of the abuses: \\"Larrabee, for his part, took offense at an Indian boy who worked for him but who would periodically run off to visit his relatives. Larrabee 'went down one morning and slaughtered the whole family of about six persons, boy and all. He then made a rude raft of logs, put the victims on it‚Ä¶ and started the bodies down the river.'\\"\\"Atrocities by White Men on Indians in Humboldt County‚ÄîRecord of a Baby-Killer,\\" San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin, June 1, 1860; Reprinted in the Sacramento Daily Union, June 4, 1860. The writer uses \\"L‚Äì‚Äî\\" instead of the perpetrator's full name, but other information in the letter, linking him to Hagans and the killing of Yo-kill-la-bah, makes it clear that \\"L‚Äì-\\" is the Larrabee referred to in Captain Lovell's dispatch.Lovell, Captain Chas., Report to Major W. W. Mackall, March 23, 1861. Quoted in Susie Baker Fountain Papers, vol. 32, 379 Leaving Humboldt County, Larrabee followed another gold rush to the Salmon River in 1862, ending up in Hellgate, Montana, where he was elected sheriff of Missoula County under the name \\"Henry P. Larrabie\\" in 1865, serving only about one year. Larrabee left Missoula in 1868 to return to Ohio at about the time his father died. Larrabee married Catherine Linn Phillips (1849-1940) on February 14, 1869 in Indiana, with whom he had five children and moved from Indiana to Joplin, Missouri, then to Wellington, Kansas and finally to Wichita, Kansas where he ran an artificial stone business. Later he was a homesteader, cattle rancher, deputy sheriff and on the school board in Liberal, Seward County, Kansas until he died on December 17, 1906 of cancer under the name \\"Henry Pierre Larrabee.\\" See also * 1860 Wiyot massacre * Bald Hills War References Further reading * Crandall, Joan, The Indian Island Massacre: An Investigation of the Events that Precipitated the Wiyot Murders May 2005 Thesis, Humboldt State University.

According to the films, Hamunaptra is a hidden city in the desert which is the resting place of Imhotep, the 3,000-year-old mummy that will revisit the Earth as a curse if released. He, and the city of Hamunaptra, are guarded by the Medjay, who do not want \\"the beast\\" to be awakened and have guarded it for centuries. It served as the resting place for Pharaohs and their wealth. Appearances The Mummy (1999) The viewer's first introduction to Hamunaptra is when Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell and his military unit in the Foreign Legion come across it in the desert. As Bronwyn Williams writes in Popular Culture and Representations of Literacy, \\"In The Mummy the object that first excites Evie's interest in Hamunaptra is a small, intricately made metal box that is a key for opening both the sarcophagus of the mummy and the fabled black Book of the Dead buried in his tomb. When the box springs open, Evie finds a map showing the location of Hamunaptra.\\" In the film, Evie is excited by the idea of Hamunaptra because her mother told her and her brother Jonathan Carnahan stories about the city when they were children. Evie enlists Rick's help in finding the city, since he has been there, with an assortment of other characters joining the troupe in traveling to the desert city. The final climactic scene at the end of The Mummy is located within Hamunaptra.Williams, p. 80 The city sinks into the sand, and the main characters barely escape with their lives. The main antechamber, filled with mounds of treasure and gold, also sinks into the sand. The Mummy Returns (2001) With the city sinking back into the sand at the end of The Mummy, in the sequel viewers see excavation attempts near the beginning of the film. Characters Meela Nais, the museum curator Hafez, and Lock-Nah oversee the excavation of Imhotep's resin- covered corpse, which they then reanimate.

Originally the Permin was a channel between the Saaler Bodden and the Baltic Sea and the southern estuarine channel of the River Recknitz. It borders on the Fischland in the south. Because the Permin was navigable in the 13th and 14th centuries with average water depths of around 2 to 3 metres, it formed an important waterway for trade to and from the towns of Ribnitz and Barth, although its navigability was frequently degraded by storms and silting up. Although the Permin was only suitable for smaller ships and mainly used by the population of the local region to ply their trade in small, open boats, the Hanseatic League believed their trading privileges were being affected. Moreover, at the end of the 14th century, trade in the Baltic was heavily disrupted by the Victual Brothers, who were supported by the Mecklenburg dukes and the Pomeranian Duke Barnim VI from time to time. The Victual Brothers used the Permin and the Loop near Ahrenshoop to enter the waters of the various boddens, which they used as a retreat in between their privateering. In 1395 the Hanseatic League had three ships sunk in the Permin, which accelerated the siltation of the channel and made it unnavigable. Which Hanseatic towns carried out this action is not absolutely certain, however, it is probably that it was the towns of Stralsund and Rostock due to their relative proximity. In 1872 a storm flood drove a creek or tidal inlet 15 metres wide and 5 metres deep in the area of the Permin. In order to join the two parts of the mainland on either side an emergency bridge had to be erected.

It opened on 4 July 1855, and it worked its own trains. The friendly North British Railway later promoted a line, at first identified as the Galashiels, Innerleithen and Peebles Railway, from Peebles to Galashiels, making a connection with the Peebles Railway there, and also with the Caledonian Railway which had its own line at Peebles. The GI&PR; line was built by the North British Railway and opened on 1 October 1864. In 1860 the Peebles Railway company leased its line to the North British Railway, which operated the Galashiels and Edinburgh sections as a continuous through route. Road transport of goods and passengers provided fierce competition in the 1950s and the line closed in 1962. No railway use is now made of the former lines. History Before the Peebles railway In the eighteenth century Peebles had become an important manufacturing town, chiefly for woollen weaving and also the preparation of cotton and linen products, and also brewing. Its location on the banks of the Upper River Tweed put it on the communication routes of the area, constrained by the hills north and south surrounding Windlestraw Law and Dollar Law respectively. When the turnpikes were introduced, Peebles was within five hours of Edinburgh by post-chaise. In 1807 Thomas Telford was commissioned to design a double-track waggonway connecting Glasgow and Berwick, a distance of , running through Carluke, Peebles and Melrose. The waggonway would have been horse-operated, and was intended to form an outlet for iron products and lime to the borders area, and agricultural products, in particular grain, to the industrial towns of central Scotland. The mountainous terrain of the route would have required steep gradients which would have been challenging for horse traction, and the estimated cost of construction was ¬£365,000, a huge amount at that time, and the scheme was dropped. A second waggonway scheme was proposed in 1821, this time designed by Robert Stevenson, on an alternative route but it too was considered too ambitious to be practicable. In 1838 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament. Although local railways had been operating in Scotland, this was a major advance, connecting the two great cities. As the construction progressed, public opinion became active over making a connection between central Scotland and the merging English railway network. The controversy became very heated, and a great number of schemes were put forward, including some that would run through Peebles. Not all of the schemes were realistic, and in time they reduced to what became the North British Railway line between Edinburgh and Berwick, the Caledonian Railway between Edinburgh and Glasgow and Carlisle through the valley of the River Annan, and what became the Glasgow and South Western Railway via Kilmarnock and Dumfries. These great companies were all authorised by Parliament in the middle years of the 1840s. The Caledonian Railway proposed the Caledonian Extension Railway in 1845, to run eastward from the Lanark area through Biggar and Stobo to Peebles, continuing through Galashiels to Kelso; this would have cost ¬£1,500,000, the same as the Caledonian Railway itself from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle. However the proposal was rejected in Parliament. In 1845 too, the North British Railway suggested a Peebles branch from Galashiels on the line that it was then building, which became the Waverley Route. The townspeople of Peebles did not think an eastward line to Galashiels was their highest priority. Supporters of an independent railway to Edinburgh had also been active, and on 23 June 1845 a meeting was held in Edinburgh. It was told that a line had been designed leaving the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway near the later Niddrie station. In the 1846 Parliamentary session, the Edinburgh and Peebles Bill failed standing orders, and the North British Peebles branch was withdrawn by its proposers: neither line would proceed.Peter Marshall, Peebles Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2005, The Peebles Railway The Peebles Railway in 1855As the Scottish railway network developed in the following years, the cost of transporting goods to and from towns connected to a line fell dramatically; and Peebles, and other towns not connected, felt at a marked disadvantage in the cost of the necessities of living, and in moving its manufactures to markets, and this heightened the feeling that Peebles must have a railway line. John Bathgate was the principal promoter of the Peebles Railway. In April 1852 a meeting was held, at which a revised version of the failed Edinburgh and Peebles scheme was tabled. The engineer Thomas Bouch was engaged. The line would run through Penicuik and join the Hawick line at Eskbank, near Dalkeith, shortening the length of new construction, and the line could be built for ¬£80,000. There was considerable enthusiasm locally and in London for the line and numerous persons registered for shares, although in the event many of them did not proceed with the commitment they had made. Enthusiasm took hold of the provisional committee too, for they sought tenders for the construction of the line and accepted one. There remained the issue of actually obtaining the Act of Parliament incorporating the company, but this went through without great difficulty and on 8 July 1853Thomas, volume 1 page 106 and Marshall (page 31); Carter, page 247 says 8 August 1853. the Peebles Railway was authorised, with capital of ¬£70,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, Getting the line ready The directors put in hand the construction of the line, under Bouch's supervision, and the share subscriptions were coming in satisfactorily. They considered the working of the line, and talked to the North British Railway but found their financial terms unacceptable. They went to some lengths to explore the possibility of getting an independent contractor to work the line, but this proved fruitless, and the company decided to work the line itself. They set about procuring the rolling stock, and planning the workforce, for operating and for track and rolling stock maintenance, that would be required. On 2 April 1855 the line was ready enough for the steam locomotive Soho to be brought to Peebles, but this seems to have been a demonstration run, for it was not until 29 May that passenger coaches and goods wagons were brought to Peebles. The line was considered ready for inspection by the Board of Trade Inspecting Officer, and Captain Tyler visited on 28 June. The inspection was thought to have gone well, but the formal approval received from the Board of Trade stipulated working by one engine only, and that sidings were required to shunt goods trains before passenger trainsMarshall, page 46; it is not clear whether this means clearing the line intermediately by horse traction or forming trains at the starting point without occupying the main line. were started. The Company had issued printed bye-laws and regulations, but these referred to disciplinary matters and not to operating rules; the Company had two locomotives and appear not to have given thought to signalling arrangements. While considering what was to be done, the Company started operating within the BoT requirements, and on 4 July 1855 the train service started.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, This apparently involved the construction of a passing loop at Penicuik.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Relations with the contractor for constructing the line appear to have deteriorated in the final months, and after opening it was stated in a General Shareholders' Meeting that there was an outstanding debt of ¬£5,600, but that the Board would not pursue for damages.Marshall, page 50; it is unclear whether the debt was from the contractor to the company or vice versa; and it is remarkable that so large a debt, equal to a year's income, should simply be written off. The line in operation Three trains operated in each direction daily, except Sundays. Leaving Edinburgh the Peebles coaches were attached at the rear of an NBR Hawick train, and detached at Eskbank. There the Peebles Railway locomotive coupled to the detached portion and took the train on to Peebles. The physical junction was at Hardengreen. The locomotives ran tender first from Eskbank to Peebles. The trains were an instant success, carryings being beyond what could have been anticipated, and the first full week brought in receipts of ¬£99, climbing a month later to ¬£166. The stations were Peebles, Eddleston, Leadburn, Penicuik, Roslin and Hawthornden, but at the last minute it was agreed to provide a station at Bonnyrigg, and this was opened a month after the opening of the line itself. In 1856 the North British Railway operated seven trains each way daily except Sundays, of which four were passenger trains. One of these was a \\"fast passenger\\" service leaving Peebles at 08:50 and taking 65 minutes, returning at 16:20 and also taking 65 minutes. Soon after the opening one of the locomotives, St Ronans, became defective, \\"because it could not negotiate the curves on the track\\". Although the Company owned two locomotives and was only allowed to use one at a time, nonetheless it found it necessary to hire in a replacement. The other locomotive was named Tweed. The locomotive fleet was soon augmented but the details are unclear. The carriage stock was also required to be increased, but these acquisitions were straining the capital resources of the company and deferment of payment was practised. The electric telegraph was installed on the line (and the NBR section), giving Peebles telegraph communication with Edinburgh for the first time, from 1858. Additional capital A Parliamentary Act was obtained on 27 June 1857 authorising the issue of an additional ¬£27,000 in shares; improvements and rectification of some deficiencies in the original construction of the line needed attention. In 1859 it was decided to install turntables at Peebles and Hardengreen Junction, as the tender-first running was said to cause excessive wear on the locomotives and the track. The North British Railway had to install the Hardengreen turntable and this seems to have been delayed, being ready in 1860. The track had been laid with the cheapest materials at the advice of the engineer Thomas Bouch, and already in 1858 it was giving trouble, being in need of major renewal. The routine maintenance was carried out by platelayers with the assistance of a labourer, each responsible for about two miles of route. In August 1860 all the wooden bridges on the line were tarred and repainted. Extending the line The Peebles lines in 1866For some time the community of Innerleithen had agitated for a railway connection, by the building of an independent line from Peebles. A number of attempts were made to bring this about without success, until in 1860 a line was proposed from Galashiels to Peebles through Innerleithen. Agreement was made for the North British Railway to run the trains.Presumably to work the line, but Marshall states (page 90) that the working of the line would be in the hands of the NBR but \\"even so the line would be ... run by local proprietors\\". The railway was promoted as the Galashiels, Innerleithen and Peebles Railway (GI&PR;). A Parliamentary Bill failed in 1860, but being re-presented the following year as an NBR branch, it gained the Royal Assent on 28 June 1861. The capital authorised was ¬£95,000. A Caledonian dependency, the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway, had been extended to Peebles and the GI&PR; line would meet it, as well as the Peebles Railway, there. The first section, from Peebles to Innerleithen, was opened on 10 October 1864Marshall, page 91; Ross says 1 October 1864, page 61, as does Perkins and the remainder on 18 June 1866. The Peebles Railway terminus at Peebles was unsuitable for the through services contemplated, and after unsuccessful overtures to the Caledonian Railway proposing a joint station, the North British Railway built a new single platform station to serve the Galashiels line and the Peebles Railway trains. It was a modest affair, opening in 1864. The Peebles Railway station continued in use for the time being, renamed Peebles (Old). The train service now operated from Galashiels to Edinburgh via Peebles, as a through route; there were five trains daily, two on Sundays, with some short workings. The Caledonian Railway station at Peebles was on the south side of the River Tweed and a connection was to be made crossing the river; the connection with the GI&PR; line was intended to be a triangle, allowing through running towards Galashiels and towards Edinburgh. It is doubtful whether the eastward curve was completed, although the earthworks were formed.Acknowledging much debate over the issue, Marshall says that at least one map and a contemporary engraving show it, but although Marshall shows a large number of images and maps in his book, he does not reproduce these. At that period map publishers often depicted proposed works as if built, hoping to future-proof their works. Marshall concedes that when Captain Rich inspected the Innerleithen line, the south to east curve was not connected. Ross refers to this on page 73, but he calls it the west-to-south link. He must have intended to say \\"the east-to-south link\\" for he goes on to regret that a through connection to the East Coast line was never realised. The NBR wished to prevent the Caledonian gaining access to Galashiels, which the curve would have enabled. When the line opened throughout, the NBR operated passenger trains through from Edinburgh to Galashiels via Peebles. Lease to the North British Railway From about 1858 the Peebles Railway considered sale of its line to the NBR \\"before major expenditure on the line would be required\\". The NBR itself was planning to absorb several local railways and negotiations were fruitful. On 14 April 1860 a shareholders' meeting heard the proposed sale, but rejected it.A simple majority voted for it, but 75% was required by statute, and this was not achieved. The Company Chairman resigned immediately. A further proposal, to lease the line to the NBR, was tabled the following year, on 1 February 1861, and shareholders voted for it. The terms were generous: the line was profitable but considerable upgrade work was necessary. The NBR agreed to pay for PR shareholders to receive between 5% and 6% dividends, as well as considerable other expenses including purchase of the Peebles Railway's rolling stock for ¬£20,000. The Peebles Railway (Lease) Act authorised the move on 11 July 1861. Connecting lines The Peebles Railway company determined not to extend its line or make branches, but it co-operated with independent concerns that wished to do so and to make connections with its line. In North British Railway days a similar policy was followed. The Leadburn, Linton and Dolphinton Railway was authorised by Act of 3 June 1862, to form a junction with the Peebles Railway line at Leadburn. It opened on 4 July 1864. The Dolphinton station was separate from the Caledonian Railway station there, although shunt transfers were possible through a siding connection. During the construction of the Dolphinton line, there was a collision at the junction at Leadburn on 29 October 1863. A construction train working on the Dolphinton line ran away on a steep gradient to Leadburn. The only protection to the main line was a scotch block at Leadburn, and the runaway vehicles ran over the block and collided head on with an approaching passenger train on the Peebles line; a boy was killed and several persons were injured. The Esk Valley Railway was being promoted in 1860; it was to run to Polton, a village with several important paper mills, from a junction with the Peebles Railway at Hardengreen. The North British Railway provided much of the deposit required to submit the Parliamentary Bill, and the Peebles Railway gave its consent. The Esk Valley Railway got its authorising Act on 21 July 1863, and the line opened on 16 April 1867. The point of divergence of the Esk Valley line was a short distance south of Hardengreen Junction, and the Esk Valley line ran parallel with the Peebles Railway for that section; it was later agreed to convert the two single lines to operate as one double track from Hardengreen Junction to Esk Valley Junction. The first station on the Esk Valley line was to be called Bonnyrigg. It was closer to the town than the Peebles Railway Bonnyrigg station, but the Peebles Railway was unwilling at first to change the name of its own station. The PR later agreed to change the name of its Bonnyrigg station to Bonnyrigg Road. This led to confusion of passengers, and the NBR renamed the station Broomieknowe and the Peebles Railway station reverted to Bonnyrigg. The nominally independent Penicuik Railway was authorised by Act of 20 June 1870, for a branch from Hawthornden on the Peebles Railway to Penicuik. It was opened on 2 September 1872, and the company was absorbed by the NBR on 1 August 1876 along with the Esk Valley Railway. The Peebles Railway had a Penicuik station, which was a considerable distance from the town, and it was now renamed Pomathorn The North British Railway had renamed Roslin as Rosslyn in 1864 and renamed it again Rosslynlee in 1872 because of the Rosslyn station on the Penicuik Railway line. Rosslyn on the Penicuik line was renamed Rosslyn Castle on 11 Feb 1874. Rosslynlee closed from 1 January 1917 to 2 June 1919. Amalgamation From 1870 the Peebles Railway and the NBR considered amalgamation, and agreement having been reached, the North British Railway (Additional Powers) Act of 13 July 1876 authorised the amalgamation, which became effective on 1 August 1876. Angling Club Cottage Platform Edinburgh Angling Club had acquired a house, named The Nest, close to the River Tweed, near Clovenfords. (The location is on Cliff Road, a short distance west of the roundabout junction of the present-day A72 and A707.) In 1898 an unadvertised halt named Angling Club Cottage Platformhttp://www.disused- stations.org.uk/a/angling_club_cottage_platform/index.shtml was provided there for the use of club members. The halt became disused in the mid-twentieth century.Roy Perkins, The Railways of Peebles, Amberley Publishing , Stroud, 2013, Angling Club Cottage Platform, at Disused Stations Website The twentieth century Section of the disused line near Torwoodlee Passenger train services had now been enhanced to six daily from Galashiels to Edinburgh via Peebles with an additional Saturdays Innerleithen to Edinburgh train; by now the typical journey time was a little under an hour from Peebles to Edinburgh. A Peeblesshire Express was introduced for business travel from Peebles to Edinburgh. It left Peebles at 08:44 daily, stopping at Leadburn to attach a portion from Broomlee on the Dolphinton branch, arriving at Edinburgh at 09:37. The return train left Edinburgh at 16:32 Monday to Friday, and 13:33 on Saturdays.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, In 1905 the North British Railway extended and improved the Peebles station, although it remained a one-platform station, with no passing loop. The Border Show was held in Peebles by the Highland and Agricultural Society in July 1906, and the North British was asked to arrange special services atr reduced rates, which it declined to do. In 1904 the NBR had declared that it considered Peebles an inappropriate location for the heavy traffic that the show would attract, due to the limited track facilities there. 20,000 visitors daily were expected, requiring 20 to 30 trains. Considerable public criticism resulted, and in March 1905 the NBR realised that the rival Caledonian Railway was improving its own Peebles branch. This resulted in an immediate move to arrange the necessary facilities. Additional stabling sidings and a passing loop were provided, and the Old station was to be reopened temporarily for passenger use. The company was still concerned about line capacity and issued a public notice that \\"The Company will not guarantee passengers will reach Peebles and will not be responsible for delays.\\" In the event the trains ran and some delays were experienced. The NBR lost considerable good will because of its stance over the matter. There was a daily goods service over the link line between the Caledonian and North British stations at Peebles, but there was never a regular passenger service. Light engines used it after the closure of Peebles (NBR) engine shed if they required to turn, using the Caledonian turntable. However some passenger excursions used the link. On 25 June 1936 a Caledonian Railway excursion from Lanark ran to Galashiels, using the link, and reversing in Peebles NBR station. In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" following the Railways Act 1921; the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Twenty five years later, nationalisation of the nation's railways took place, and the Peebles route was part of the Scottish Region of British Railways. Now that both railway lines to Peebles were under the same ownership, Peebles NBR station was renamed Peebles (East) on 25 September 1952, although the former Caledonian Railway branch had closed to passengers by then. The NBR station reverted to simple Peebles in February 1958. Diesel multiple unit trains were introduced on the line from 17 February 1958 after a demonstration run on 11 June 1956; a considerably enhanced passenger service was introduced in the Edinburgh suburban area, extending out as far as Rosewell. A new station, Rosslynlee Hospital Halt, was opened on 11 December 1958 to serve Rosslynlee Hospital; the exiting Rosslynlee station was not conveniently situated for the hospital.W and E A Munro, Lost Railways of Midlothian, self-published by W & E A Munro, 1985 The House Steward at the hospital sold tickets. However the general decline in local rural passenger services was hastened by the improving bus services, and the Peebles line was nominated for closure. The final passenger trains ran on 3 February 1962, and the following day the route between Hawthornden Junction and Galashiels via Peebles was closed completely. The Edinburgh suburban passenger service from Edinburgh to Rosewell and Hawthornden continued until Saturday 8 September 1962, being closed from 10 September. The Penicuik branch continued to operate a goods train service, and the Peebles Railway section from Hardengreen Junction to Hawthornden Junction (where the Penicuik line diverged) remained open to serve those trains, until they ceased in 1967. The entire network of lines is closed to railway activity; the section between Hardengreen Junction and Rosewell has been converted to a cycleway.http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Peebles_Railway/index.php Topography Original Peebles Railway line: opened 4 July 1855; closed from Hawthornden Junction to Peebles 5 February 1962; closed to passengers from Hardengreen Junction to Rosewell 10 September 1962..

It was set to be released on 26 March 2012 but was delayed until 23 April 2012. It was due to be the second in a series of two albums released in 2010 by the band, following up previous album Renegades. However, the band decided to hold more recording sessions for the album, leading them to delay the album until 2012. Recording and production In 2010, during the Renegades sessions, a number of tracks were left off the album before then being considered for inclusion for the follow-up to that album. As there were not enough to fit on the album, more were recorded during the closing stages of the year, with the band taking a break from recording on 19 December, before resuming recording on 10 January 2011. Between 16 January and 24 January a production session began in New York City, this included overdubs, guitars and keyboards with frontman Grant Nicholas also flying over to record vocals, while some of the album was already recorded in London. On 19 January 2011 a photo of song lyrics written on a sheet of paper was posted on their official Facebook page. One song was debuted live on tour under three different working titles, with those being \\"Jessie\\", \\"White City Rock\\" and \\"Borders\\". In an interview with Heineken Music, on 27 January 2011 Grant revealed that 19 or 20 songs were in the recording stages, while the album, like Renegades, looked likely to be released domestically on their own Big Teeth Music imprint. In an interview with The University Observer, Grant describes the album: \\"Its eclectic, much more eclectic than the Renegades album... Its definitely a more commercial record. I think if you liked Comfort in Sound and you liked Yesterday Went Too Soon, then I think you‚Äôll like this album\\" ... \\"There are some real tunes on this and some anthems; there are some rocky moments as well\\". There were also plans to release a single or a free track download during their February - March tour. This later went on to become \\"Side By Side\\", which was a chart-eligible paid download in aid of the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The single charted at #91, marking their first top 100 chart visit since 2008's \\"We Are the People\\", while becoming their 25th top 100 single in the process. It ultimately did not appear on the album, although was included as a bonus track on the Japanese release. During their 2011 touring, Feeder introduced drummer Damon Wilson as a live regular and session musician. On 23 September 2011, Grant Nicholas posted on the band's Facebook page that the recording of their studio album was complete with only mixing on the final song to be finalised, before mastering then began on the 30 September in New York. Feeder announced on 10 October that they were doing artwork on the album, before an announcement was made on 14 November, that acoustic versions of some of the songs were being recorded while bassist Taka Hirose was staying in Tokyo. On 29 November 2011, the sequencing process of the album began. Feeder hosted a trailer on YouTube titled \\"Coming Soon\\" on 2 December 2011 and had a message written in Morse code as \\"-... --- .-. -.. . .-. ...\\", which translates to \\"Borders\\" in standard English. On 6 December 2011 another trailer was released, announcing \\"Borders\\" as the first single from the new album, including a four-date tour. \\"Borders\\" was released on CD, cassette and 7\\" on 30 January 2012, with the parent album Generation Freakshow on 23 April 2012. This was the first time Feeder released a cassette single since 2001's \\"Just a Day\\"; \\"Borders\\" went on to chart at #52. The only track from the sessions of the Renegades album to end up on Generation Freakshow, was that of \\"Tiny Minds\\".\\"Generation Freakshow Review\\" Drowned in Sound 23 April Retrieved 29 April 2012 Reception Generation Freakshow was met with mixed reviews and was a commercial failure due to not reaching the top 10 of the album charts; where the band at the time frequently charted. Metro described Feeder as \\"keeping a steady musical pace,yet stick to the same predictable formula\\" when reviewing Generation Freakshow.\\"Feeders Generation Freakshow sticks to same predictable formula\\" Metro 23 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012BBC Music praised the album as \\"more mature,more considered and less noisy\\".\\"Feeder Generation Freakshow Review\\" BBC Music 10 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012 After two weeks the album had sold 9000 copies in the UK.Sales Figures 6 May 2012 Retrieved 8 May 2012 The album received a two star rating from The Guardian, being described as \\"solid yet uninspiring\\".Feeder:Generation Freakshow-Review The Guardian 22 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012 Drowned in Sound credited Feeder for creating another strong addition to their back catalogue. Kerrang! were also positive in their review, stating that \\"the 12 fabulous songs that comprise Generation Freakshow see Feeder striking the canvas with more measured strokes\\". In response to the critical reception, frontman Grant Nicholas commented that the band have nevertheless, never been critically well received during the whole of their career, while also not being worried about where the release charts, as long as Feeder's fans like the album. In Japan, the album was better received in the media, in the same way that Pushing the Senses was in Austria. The album was a relative commercial failure, charting at #13 in the UK albums chart, despite being an improvement on the #16 of Renegades. Lead single ‚ÄúBorders\\" however brought Feeder back into the top 75 charts after a near four-year absence, when it charted at #52 in February 2012; none of the singles on Renegades charted. The album also seen the band return to the Brixton Academy after a four-year absence, one of the UK's major gig venues. Before this, the band had returned to the smaller venues within the capital and the rest of the UK. Despite the commercial failure of the album and overall mixed critical reception, the album was still however well received by their fanbase, which resulted in the band continuing to play tracks from it at live shows. Furthermore, the fanbase reception enabled the album on 24 March 2017, to see a reissue with nine bonus tracks including \\"Sky Life\\" as a standalone track which played immediately after \\"Children of the Sun\\" as a hidden track on the original release, which is now out of print and no longer available to stream. In August 2019, the band were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame, with this album being one of the reasons the band were inducted, being due to the 4/5 rating their magazine counterpart awarded the album.

Biography Wirjono was born in Surakarta, Dutch East Indies, on 15 June 1903. After completing his primary education, he attended the Rechtsschool in Batavia, graduating in 1922. He then became a judge, later taking time to study at Leiden University in Leiden, Netherlands. Although Wirjono had already announced his candidacy for the People's Representative Council, in early 1952 he was selected as head justice of the Indonesian Supreme Court, replacing Kusumah Atmaja. During his time as head justice, the court was explicitly under the executive branch of the government. He was increasingly marginalized; for example, when he accompanied the Indonesian president to the United States in 1959, he sat with senators and congressmen, while his American counterpart, Earl Warren, was seated with Presidents Sukarno and Dwight D. Eisenhower. In another case, Sukarno invited Ruslan Abdulgani to breakfast when Abdulgani was supposed to be before the court as a slight to the court's powers. In 1960, Wirjono was appointed to the cabinet. Initially stating that his appointment would not affect the separation of powers, when Sukarno did away with the legal concept Wirjono felt tricked and considered resigning. Towards the end of Sukarno's regime, Wirjono continued to garner greater power. Together with Minister of Justice Sahardjo, Wirjono argued for greater protection of the freedoms of criminals and suspects; this eventually won general support, as the populace was displeased with the poor performance of Prosecutor General Goenawan. The two then moved to civil law reform; Wirjono strongly supported Sahardjo's suggestion to rescind the current civil and commercial codes. However, this was opposed by advocates and judges; the advocates and judges argued that said proposal would increase legal uncertainty, while Wirjono argued that little would change as much had already been replaced. Wirjono eventually propagated a circular on 5 September 1963 that declared seven articles that were to be considered invalid, involving gifts, rentals, and legitimation of children born out of wedlock. Wirjono later replaced Astrawinata to become the Minister of Justice in the Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet, serving from 28 March to 25 July 1966. After Suharto took greater control of the government, Wirjono was replaced by Umar Seno Aji. Wirjono died in April 1985. Legal acts Wirjono was instrumental in drafting Emergency Law Number 1 of 1951, which established that there were three levels of court in Indonesia: public, appeals, and supreme. Later, when dealing with a Batak Karo adat (traditional law) inheritance case as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he and the court ruled that women had a right to an inheritance; this was against the Karo adat. However, his term as chief justice saw a greater increase in state intervention, with one of his 1964 instructions stating that the justices would have to work together with the prosecution to ensure that the verdict did not stray far from the indictment.

It was last modified in 1900. The class is still sailed to this day, notably with large Water Wag fleets racing during summer evenings from D√∫n Laoghaire harbour on Dublin Bay.. The Water Wag class is administered by the Water Wags club, based in D√∫n Laoghaire. The Water Wag inspired similar one-design fleets around Ireland and subsequently around the world. Design In 1886 the Water Wag was designed as a one-design sailing and rowing boat by Thomas B. Middleton of Shankill Corinthian Sailing Club. are silver-spruce-planked boats with a sloop rig and of main sail, and with a spinnaker and no jib. The boat is open-decked, with a single mast close to the bow. Middleton, who was a solicitor and not a professional yacht designer, prepared a concept sketch for the boat which may have been developed into a construction drawing by Robert McAllister of Dunbarton, Scotland. It is probable that McAllister reviewed his drawing with the eminent Scotch designer G.L. Watson before constructing the first boat \\"Eva\\" for Middleton in late 1886. In 1900 the Water Wag design was changed by the writing of a much more prescriptive specification and a transom stern, lengthening the boat by and making the stern of the boat much larger. The outward angled transom was designed to improve the aesthetics of the boat, and to save building cost. The sail area was increased from to by adding a jib. The new design was subject to some minor adjustments of sheer line and rudder size over the years 1901-1902 before the design, by James (or Maimie) Doyle from D√∫n Laoghaire, was finalised. Despite being a larger boat the cost of building was less. The Class has never been tempted to adopt construction materials other than wood. Traditionally the sails were made of calico, cotton, and subsequently silk. In recent years Terylene and nylon have been used with the effect that coloured spinnakers are now used by most boats. A variant of the original design, with its double-ended hull, found its way to Herne Bay Sailing Club in Kent, England, and during the 1920s and 1930s several boats were built locally and the class was actively raced during the 1930s and 1940s. These boats, however, were not built to the strict one-design principle of the originals and as well as differing from the original in several respects (foredeck, bowsprit, mast position) they also differed slightly from each other and so raced as a handicap fleet. By the early 1950s most of the boats had been sold out of the Kent club and racing ceased. One of the last boats to be built in Kent, by E and B Gammon at Herne Bay in 1947, is in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. A variant of the 1900 design was adopted by many clubs in India and Sri Lanka, the main difference being the use of teak planking which being heavier, resulted in the boat requiring more freeboard. A small foredeck was added to assist in keeping the boat drier. Water Wags do not carry any symbol on the sails, and have no individual identifying mark beyond the sail number on the main sail and different spinnaker colours. Despite every boat of the Water Wag Class having a unique name, none of the names are painted or engraved on the hulls. All boats are generally referred to by their names and not by their numbers, particularly when hailing and congratulating a fellow sailor on a good race result.

Born and raised in The Bronx, he lived in an apartment on the corner of 179th St. and Mapes Ave. He was an original member of The Belmonts (with and without Dion DiMucci), a popular singing group of the late 1950s and early 1960s.DiMucci, Dion with Seay, Davin: The Wanderer: Dion's Story. New York: Beech Tree Books (1988); Greil Marcus 1990: liner notes for CD Cigars, Acappella, Candy He led the progressive rock/jazz ensemble, \\"Pulse\\", during the 1970s. Early career Mastrangelo sang bass during the period that the group was known as Dion and the Belmonts. After the group's breakup with DiMucci, he sang lead vocals on all Belmonts recordings until leaving for a solo career in 1962. Following the hit, \\"Come On Little Angel\\", a split developed within the group concerning the finances of their privately owned label, Sabina (a.k.a. Sabrina) Records. Mastrangelo said, \\"Because we owned the company, we had to pay the bills, studio time, ads, and stuff like that. We needed hits that sold around 500,000 copies to make enough. That was the worst move we ever made. If we hadn't done that, we would have been together all these years. It was very sad, like leaving my two brothers\\". Mastrangelo left the group and attempted a solo career on Laurie Records, releasing four singles under the name Carlo. He was backed vocally by the uncredited Tremonts (aka The Demilles). The singles, \\"Baby Doll\\", and \\"Little Orphan Girl\\", received considerable airplay in Florida and a few other states, but didn't make the national charts. \\"Ring-A-Ling\\", a tune which he overdubbed catchy bass vocals to, was a favorite of New York disc jockey Murray the K. He featured it on his weekly, \\"Record Review Board Contest\\", February 12, 1964, and it was the clear winner. It received airplay on New York stations WINS and WENE, but also failed to chart nationally. Around the same time, he contributed backing bass vocals to the Laurie single, \\"Donna Lee\\", by the Demilles, before joining DiMucci again. Between 1964 and 1966 Mastrangelo was Dion DiMucci's occasional songwriting partner, backup vocalist, and drummer in the group, \\"Dion and the Wanderers\\". Recording for Columbia Records, they released three uncharted singles and made national appearances on Dick Clark's, \\"Where The Action Is\\", and \\"The Lloyd Thaxton Show\\". In late 1966, the three original Belmonts; Mastrangelo, Milano, and D'Aleo, reunited with DiMucci and released the album, \\"Dion & The Belmonts Together Again\\", for ABC Records. Produced by \\"DiMont Music\\", Mastrangelo played drums and DiMucci contributed guitar to reduce the need for additional session musicians. Two singles were released from the LP; \\"My Girl The Month of May\\"/\\"Berimbau\\", and \\"Movin' Man\\"/\\"For Bobbie\\". Neither charted in the United States, but fared better in England. During their brief reunion they appeared on the popular \\"Clay Cole Show\\" debuting \\"Berimbau\\" and \\"My Girl The Month of May\\", and occasionally performed at local New York City clubs such as \\"The Mardi Gras\\" on Staten Island (April 29, 1967) before disbanding. Later career In the late 1960s, Mastrangelo was lead vocalist for, \\"The Endless Pulse\\", recording three uncharted singles for Laurie Records. Subsequent releases included the bubblegum rock, Ernie Maresca produced, \\"Shoo-Fly Pie & Apple Pan Dowdy\\" on Tower Records, followed by a progressive version of the Peggy Lee classic \\"Fever\\", and \\"Let There Be Love\\" on the Raftis label. In the early 1970s, Mastrangelo sang lead, played drums, percussion, and kazoo for the jazz-rock ensemble, \\"Pulse\\" (initially known as The Endless Pulse). Members included Kenny Sambolin, Richie Goggin, Bill Golden, and Chris Gentile. In late 1971, they recorded the LP; \\"Pulse-featuring Carlo Mastrangelo\\", later released in 1972 on the small Thimble label. Most of the material on the ten-track album was written by Mastrangelo, with an emphasis placed on organ and fuzz guitar. The LP is noted for being one of the few hard rock albums featuring a kazoo solo, and stands up well as a fine progressive rock composition. After Pulse disbanded, he formed and sang lead for The Midnite Sun, a popular New York City area nightclub band. Members included Kenny Sambolin - bass guitar, Bobby Coleman - lead guitar, Judy Purse - singer, and his cousin Joey DeMaria on drums. That later changed to Carlo on drums and Charlie Carlisi on lead guitar. After recording the jazz-rock album, Mastrangelo, D'Aleo, Milano, and DiMucci reunited in New York City on June 2, 1972, for a Richard Nader \\"Rock and Roll Revival\\" concert. The live performance, recorded by Warner Brothers, was titled, \\"Dion and The Belmonts ‚Äì Reunion: Live at Madison Square Garden 1972\\". The following year, all four original members did another reunion concert at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, NY, with no recording ever being issued. Although no longer an official member of the Belmonts, Mastrangelo did backing vocals on all nine tracks of the Belmonts' album, \\"Cigars, Acappella, Candy\\", released by Buddah Records in 1972. He also sang lead vocals on the songs, \\"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\\", and \\"We Belong Together\\". The LP received many favorable reviews, being distinguished for its medley of 13 four-part harmony tracks titled \\"Street Corner Symphony\\".

Nida was an ancient Roman town in the area today occupied by the northwestern suburbs of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, specifically Frankfurt- Heddernheim, on the edge of the Wetterau region. At the time of the Roman empire, it was the capital of the Civitas Taunensium. The name of the settlement is known thanks to written sources from Roman times and probably derives from the name of the adjacent river Nidda. History The area of the Civitas Taunensium was initially occupied with the Germanic campaigns of Emperor Augustus during the Roman expansion to create the Roman province of Germania. Here, the Rhine river area in the shape of the \\"Wetterau range\\" extended extensively into German territory. From the legionary camp of Mogontiacum (modern-day Mainz) a series of fortresses were created, which made it safer for Roman units to march from the Rhine into the inner German territories. These castra were located in R√∂dgen, Friedberg, Bad Nauheim, and possibly Nida. Additionally, the existence of the Roman forum of Waldgirmes also falls into this period.Livius: Waldgirmes The fortifications were connected by a military road, now known as \\"Elisabethenstrasse\\". A second supply route was the water: the Main and Nidda rivers served mainly for the transport of goods and materials. To secure the waterway, a fortress in Frankfurt-H√∂chst might have been used, where walls of this time were found in Bolongarostra√üe. But with the devastating defeat of Varus in 9 AD the Roman expansion was halted. The first traces of a temporary Roman civilian settlement (called vicus) date to the reign of Emperor Vespasian in the years 69 to 79 AD. Traffic routes throughout the Rhine-Main-Area came together here and the Romans sought to control and protect these. Traces of eleven military forts (castella) have been found, but most of them appear to have been temporary. The most solidly fortified was 'Castellum A', which was constructed of stone and which seems to have been abandoned by the military around 110 AD. However, it formed the core of the town which evolved around it. At its peak, during the peaceful 1st century AD, Nida probably had a population of 10,000 and was one of the biggest Roman settlements in the area enclosed by the limes. It had a market, public baths, city walls and a theatre. Map of the Roman province of Germania showing Nida Nida was officially established as capital of \\"Civitas Taunensium\\" by emperor Trajan in 110 AD.Thomas Schmidts. Central places in Germania Superior: Nida Indeed the town grew into an important civilian settlement, and after the withdrawal of troops to the Limes around 110 AD, became the main town of the \\"Civitas Taunensium\\". There have been three Mithraea (temples to Mithras) discovered at Nida: a hoard of silver votive plaques was discovered in the Roman vicus in the nineteenth century, some of which are in the British MuseumBritish Museum Collection (the offerings appear to have been deposited in a shrine dedicated to the Roman God of Jupiter Dolichenus). Nida appears to have gone into decline gradually from about 259-260 AD in the face of the invading Alamanni. Recent research on coins found there shows that there might have been people living in the city up until about 275 AD. However, some new researches indicate that the vicus was populated until the fifth century, probably with mixed populations of Romanized Germans & invading Alamanni. The remains of Nida survived for centuries afterwards and were visible in the so-called Heidenfeld ('heathens' field') near Heddernheim until at least the 15th century, when walls above ground began to be broken down to be used as building material by people from the nearby villages. Extensive underground remains, with walls several metres high, were known to have survived untouched in the field and were subject of a few archaeological excavations, that found pottery, fibulas & statuesNida archaeological discoveries & a beautiful helm.Photo of Nida helm However, their destruction began with the construction of the \\"R√∂merstadt\\",Romerstadt a new residential suburb, in 1927-9 and was completed during the \\"Nordweststadt\\" building project from 1961 to 1973. Little remains of Nida today after this destruction: only two pottery kilns, a well, and a little portion of the city walls with some doorsteps have survived.

Rassias, professor and creator of the Rassias Method¬Æ for Language instruction John Arthur Rassias (August 20, 1925 ‚Äì December 2, 2015) was an American professor who developed a method for the teaching of foreign languages, the Rassias Method, also known as the Dartmouth Intensive Language Model. John Rassias founded the Rassias Center for World Languages and Cultures, a department of Dartmouth College situated in the Office of the Provost that works with language learners and professionals from around the world.  Early life  John A. Rassias was born on August 20, 1925 to Athanathios and Eleni (Leonardakis) Rassias, immigrants from Georgitsi, Greece. A WWII veteran, Rassias enlisted in the Marines, fought on Okinawa, and was part of the occupying forces. Rassias later referred to his experience in the war as important to his understanding of how cultural and linguistic understanding connects people of varying backgrounds and experiences. As Rassias states in his upcoming book To Be Human, the Unzipped Mind: \\"I am born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to a Greek father and Greek mother. Then some buddies and I invade Okinawa. Then I become a teacher...The war has ended... As the Occupation wears on I come into contact with more and more Japanese. Suspicion and distrust give way gradually to the need to communicate and work with them. I roam over the destroyed city (Sasebo)‚Ä¶The desire to understand the Japanese eventually overcomes the hate we‚Äôve absorbed in our training and in combat, it is displaced by the simple human response of sympathy for the afflicted. For the second time in my life, language becomes the arbiter between me and others. Emotion. Learning takes place there, for nothing is real unless it touches me and I embrace it.\\"  Education  Rassias graduated summa cum laude from the University of Bridgeport, and later obtained a doctorat d‚ÄôEtat at the University of Dijon, Dijon, France. He continued with further research at the Sorbonne and also studied at and performed with the Cours R√©n√© Simon in Paris in the 1950s. Rassias also received a certificate from the Institut de Phon√©tique in Paris and completed additional study at Laval University in Qu√©bec.  Work  In 1964 John Rassias became a consultant for Peace Corps language education programs throughout the world. He also served as Director of the first pilot program of languages for the Peace Corps in Africa and as Director of Language Programs at Dartmouth. This work initiated his development of the Rassias teaching method. From 1965 to 2015 Rassias was William R. Kenan Professor of French and Italian at Dartmouth College, where the Rassias Center uses his method. At Dartmouth, he was the founder and director of Dartmouth‚Äôs Language Study Abroad (LSA) program, through which Dartmouth students may complete their language requirement in a foreign country. Rassias \\"put the teacher in the role of the performer, acting out words and expressions in imaginary real-life settings and inculcating vocabulary and grammar through rapid-fire drills that gave students no time to think in English.\\" He believed that every class was to be treated like the first class, and for this reason gained appreciation from his students. In 1978 Rassias was appointed to President Jimmy Carter's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies. In 1994, Rassias was appointed to the Commission of the Modern Language Association of America on the study of service in the profession. He was also elected to the Division of the Teaching of Literature of the Modern Language Association in 1995, which he chaired in 1998. In addition, Rassias served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Foreign Languages to the Connecticut State Board of Education. In 1998, Rassias was appointed as head of a commission focused on preserving the Greek language among Americans of Greek heritage by the Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. In 2006, Rassias participated of the creation of a March 2007 pilot program for Intensive English (IE) education outside of Mexico City. This pilot program became called the Inter-American Partnership for Education (IAPE), which remains active today and has worked with thousands of Mexican teachers. Currently, IAPE is working with UC San Diego U.S.-Mexican Students on introducing the Biliteracy Seal to various states in Mexico.  The Rassias Method  The method aims to \\"make the participant feel comfortable and natural with the language in a short period of time\\" and involves \\"teaching procedures and dramatic techniques which seek to eliminate inhibitions and create an atmosphere of free expression from the very first day of class\\". The emphasis of the Rassias Method is on spoken language while interweaving written work. All 50 techniques stress theatrical elements as well as immediate positive reinforcement and error correction. The Rassias Method relies heavily on experience as the teacher, supporting the idea that ‚Äúthe best way to learn a second language is to speak it and live it.‚Äù Because of this, language instructors attempt to primarily speak in the target language in order to encourage students to participate through the new medium.Stansfield, Charles and Hornor, Jeanne. The Dartmouth/Rassias Model of Teaching Foreign Language. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED197592.pdf Creating an environment in which the student feels comfortable being themselves allows for the maximum amount of growth opportunities. Thus, many different styles of teaching and teaching techniques are employed around the world as subsets of this method. Activities may include group work or acting out situations that a student might run into in real life.  Personal life  Rassias was married to Mary Ann Evanstock (1928-2012) from 1954 to 2012 and had three children, nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.  Awards, Honors and Distinctions  John Rassias received many awards for his work in language education, including the following: * First Arthur Wilson Outstanding Teacher Award at Dartmouth (1968) * E. Harris Harbison Award for Gifted Teaching by the Danforth Foundation (1971) * Endowed Chair, William R. Kenan Professor (1977) * Dartmouth College's Inaugural President's Medal for Outstanding Leadership and Achievement in 1991. * Robert A. Fish Memorial Prize in Outstanding Teaching awarded by the Dean of the Faculty at Dartmouth College (1997) * Dartmouth Class of 2008 Distinguished Teaching Award (2008) Rassias received eight honorary degrees from the following: * University of Bridgeport (Connecticut), * Alma College (Michigan), * Washington University (Missouri), * Plymouth State College (New Hampshire), * University of Detroit (Michigan), * Hampden-Sydney (Virginia) * Moravian College (Pennsylvania) * Pine Manor College (Massachusetts)  Legacy  Rassias died in Norwich, Vermont on December 2, 2015 at the age of 90. The Rassias Center, run by Rassias‚Äô daughter, Helene Rassias-Miles, continues to provide language education to Dartmouth community members and learners all over the world. Dartmouth undergraduates continue to receive language instruction through the Rassias Method. Throughout his career Rassias reached a large number of students and educators around the world. Archives suggest that to date, his work has affected more than 200,000 Peace Corps volunteers since 1964 and continues to be fundamental in that organization‚Äôs language instruction approach. An innovative language curriculum designer, Rassias started, in the early 1980s, immersion language programs for continuing education purposes. These highly efficient 10-day summer programs have enabled adult language learners to make significant gains in their command of the oral and written foreign language in a short period of time. Some rank beginners have even been able to reach the Intermediate-Low level (ACTFL scale) during the program, an achievement which usually requires three to four semesters in college curricula. At Dartmouth and other U.S. post-secondary institutions, the Rassias Method has been used to teach more than 25,000 students in language acquisition courses. Through the Inter-American Partnership for Education (IAPE) over 1.5 million students of all ages in Mexico have been impacted by faculty trained in the Rassias Method. Finally, language learners worldwide continue to receive instruction in the method through workshops and classes offered through the Rassias Center.

In June 1950, soon after the Korean War breaks out, a troop of North Korean soldiers enter a small South Korean village. The troop captain proclaims that they came to liberate the villagers but their true agenda is to ferret out the reactionaries. The villagers offer them heartfelt hospitality and cooperation to avoid falling out of the army's favor. Eventually genuinely strong and close friendship starts to build up between the soldiers and the villagers. Screenwriter Bae Se-young was inspired by a true story in the life of her grandmother, who used to live in Pyeongtaek. A group of soldiers from the North Korean People's Army stayed for a couple of days at the grandmother's home (because her father was the village leader), and one young soldier, touched by the villagers' hospitality, said that he wanted to stay. When asked to describe the film, director Park Geon-yong said that its \\"main purpose is to highlight the plight of the most vulnerable people in the Korean War - innocent civilians.\\" He said he \\"wanted to use it to inspire viewers to think about what the war left behind,\\" and \\"tried to give the tragic story a light- hearted touch.\\" Plot In a remote village called Seokjeongni, the residents manage to learn that North Korean troops have invaded the South via the chief's radio. Normalcy nevertheless continues for the villagers, who are all preoccupied with more pressing matters: an arranged wedding. Just a few days before the ceremony the groom is forced to flee when news breaks that Northern troops are fast capturing cities and annihilating anticommunist activists. But Seol-hee (Jung Ryeo-won) has no time to brood over her missing, beloved husband-to-be. North Korean troops arrive in town and announce their holy mission to \\"liberate\\" the Southerners. As the chief's granddaughter and town's only schoolteacher, Seol-hee must remain strong ‚Äî but instead of resisting the unwelcome guests she joins the town's intricate survival scheme and zealously embraces the Marxist teachings. Hot-tempered widower Jae-chun (Yoo Hae-jin), quiet yet clever Baek (Kim Sang-ho), and even Seol-hee's unassuming grandfather (Byun Hee-bong) manage to feign unwavering loyalty. Then a rivalry ensues between Seokjoengni and a neighboring village to host the construction of a bomb shelter under the soldiers' supervision. Meanwhile, the troop's officer, Jung-woong (Kim Joo-hyuk), is propelled by an ulterior motive. He wants to find the charming young girl he met twelve years ago when Korea was one country. What begins as a facade, however, develops into genuine and strong feelings among people who would have been neighbors if it hadn't been for geopolitics. Obvious signs of intensely pure romantic love also blossom between Jung-woong and Seol-hee, but the peaceful coexistence proves all too fragile amid the realities of war. Cast *Kim Joo-hyuk ...

Plot Donald Duck is working for Scrooge McDuck by cleaning his office, and Huey, Dewey and Louie are helping him. When they are working, Scrooge notices that Donald can tell Huey, Dewey and Louie apart from each other despite them looking almost completely identical. This gives Scrooge an idea, and he takes Donald to an ophthalmologist, who diagnoses that because of Donald having lived for years with his nephews and trying to tell them apart, he has developed extraordinarily sharp eyesight, which however only works subconsciously. Scrooge decides to put this into business use, enlisting Donald as a quality inspector in his factories. However, because Donald's sharp eyesight only works subconsciously, he bumbles up his every assignment because his subconscious mind has not taken into account all of the rules. The third assignment ends in a disaster when a large steel oven that Donald had been inspecting falls down. Any large catastrophic results are avoided, but Donald decides he has had enough and feigns that he has lost his sharp eyesight, in order to return to his normal, safe job.

The highest recorded peak water level was about 3.3 m above sea level (NN).  Course  In the days before the storm tide, a storm blew from the southwest across the Baltic that drove the sea towards Finland and Balticum. The result was flooding there and extreme low water levels on the Danish-German coastlines. As a result, large quantities of water were able to flow into the western Baltic from the North Sea. The storm increased in strength, and changed direction. The winds now blew from the northeast, and drove the water masses back in a south-westerly direction. Because the water could only flow slowly back into the North Sea, huge waves caught coastal dwellers by surprise on the morning of 13 November 1872 and caused floods over a metre high in coastal towns and villages.  Short-term impact  Of all the German coastal settlements, Eckernf√∂rde was most heavily damaged due to its location on the Bay of Eckernf√∂rde which was wide open to the northeast. The entire town was flooded, 78 houses were destroyed, 138 damaged and 112 families became homeless. In Mecklenburg and West Pomerania 32 people lost their lives on land due to the floods. The Danish island of Lolland, which still has areas enclosed by dykes today that lie below sea level, was badly hit. In the Greifswald village of Wieck almost all the buildings were destroyed and nine people drowned. Houses were rubbled as far as the centre of Greifswald. Peenem√ºnde was completely swamped. On Falster 52 died; on Lolland 28. In all the flood cost the lives of at least 271 people on the Baltic Sea coast; 2,850 houses were destroyed or at least badly damaged and 15,160 people left homeless as a result.  Long-term impact  As a result of this disaster, which also flooded large parts of Prerow on the Dar√ü, the Prerower Strom, which had hitherto separated the island of Zingst from Dar√ü, silted up. In 1874, the Prerow-Strom was finally filled in and protected with a dyke; Zingst thus became a peninsula. The Koserower Damerow was destroyed and the island of Usedom near Koserow split in two. Following a further flood in February 1874, in which the remains of the buildings were destroyed and a layer of sand up to 60 cm thick left behind, Damerow was abandoned.  Classification  This flood counts statistically as a 100-year flood. A storm flood of similar dimensions today would cause far more damage because the coastal region is much more densely populated than at that time.

Currently acting as a full-time simulcast of co-owned WOPC, the station's broadcast license is held by Will Nunley's Nunley Media Group, LLC. The station was established as \\"WHLP\\" in November 1955. History  Early years  This station began broadcast operations on November 16, 1955, licensed as WHLP. In December of 1962 WMAK became a TOP 40 chart music station. Promotion and stunts made the station competitive in the Nashville radio market. Before this time WKDA had been the dominate TOP 40 station in Nashville, helmed by Jack Stapp a local music publisher and owner of TREE Music Publishing in Nashville. With the installation of Ralley Stanton as Program Director of WMAK, WMAK became competitive and Fred Gregg the owner (who also owned WAKY in Louisville, Kentucky) helped put WMAK into a competitive position by installing a new 5K RCA transmitter. With the new sound and complete coverage in the Middle Tennessee market WMAK reached number two in the Pulse Rating Service and number Three in the Monthly Hooper Ratings. Air staff at that time included: Allen (Dennis) and Alan (Nelson - the News Director)in the morning. Gene Clark Middays 9AM-2PM, Jay Reynolds 2PM to 6PM, Frank Jolley 6 PM -Midnight. WMAK signed off at midnight until later in the sixties when Scott Shannon became Program Director and took the station full time and installing his new brand of Top 40 Radio in the station. WMAK became the number one rated radio station under the tutelage of Scott Shannon. In April 1981, control of WHLP broadcast license holder Davidson Broadcasting Corporation was transferred from Mildred B. Littleton to E.J. Preston. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the transfer on June 18, 1981. However, the station soon encountered financial difficulties and the station was placed in receivership. In February 1984, the license was involuntarily transferred from the Davidson Broadcasting Corporation to Larry G. Womack, acting as receiver. The FCC approved the move on February 15, 1984, and it was consummated on March 9, 1984. A buyer was quickly found and in September 1984, Larry G. Womack filed an application with the FCC to transfer WHLP to Richard Wayne Durham. The Commission approved the sale on October 30, 1984, and formal consummation took place on November 15, 1984. However, WHLP again found itself in financial difficulties and receivership three years later. In August 1988, receiver William A. Potts notified the FCC that the station's license and assets had been involuntarily transferred from Richard Wayne Durham. The FCC approved the transfer on September 9, 1988, and formal consummation occurred on September 26, 1988. After an aborted attempt to sell the station to Wiggins Broadcasting in 1990, William A. Potts reached a deal to sell WHLP to Hickman County Broadcasting, Inc., in May 1991. The deal gained FCC approval on June 27, 1991, and the transaction was formally consummated on July 10, 1991. At the new owner's request, the station was assigned new call sign \\"WNKX\\" by the FCC in August 1991. Branded as \\"KiX 96\\", in conjunction with then-sister station WNKX-FM (96.7 FM), the stations were marketed with the slogan \\"Southwest Middle Tennessee's Country Leader\\". WNKX era In June 2008, Hickman County Broadcasting, Inc., contracted to sell WNKX to Grace Broadcasting Services, Inc., for an undisclosed sum. The FCC approved the sale on August 15, 2008, and formal consummation of the transaction took place on November 1, 2008. At the time of the sale, Grace Broadcasting Services owned a dozen other Tennessee radio stations in whole or in part, including nearby WFGZ, WMLR, and WVRY. As the sale was nearing completion in October 2008, an application was filed with the FCC for a construction permit to relocate the station's city of license to Lobelville, Tennessee, to reduce daytime power from 5,000 to 1,000 watts, to reduce nighttime power from 77 to 66 watts, and to move the transmitter site west from 35¬∞45'29\\"N, 87¬∞27'35\\"W to 35¬∞46'01\\"N, 87¬∞49'52\\"W. After a series of engineering amendments to the original application, the FCC granted the permit on March 3, 2011, with a scheduled expiration of March 3, 2014. The move is calculated to allow Grace Broadcasting Services move WFGZ (94.5 FM) from Lobelville to Bellevue, a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee, while maintaining broadcast service to Lobelville. When the sale was consummated on November 1, 2008, the station went dark while the new owners awaited FCC approval of this construction permit to allow relocation of the station and its transmitter. The station returned briefly to the air from the old facilities on September 23, 2009, before falling silent again on September 29, 2009. (If any broadcast station is continuously silent for a full year, their license is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation by the FCC.) In October 2009, Grace Broadcasting Services applied to the FCC for special temporary authority to remain silent. They requested the additional time to improve the station's technical facilities and to hire new staff. The Commission granted this authority on February 2, 2010, with a scheduled expiration of August 3, 2010. The station's owners notified the FCC that WNKX resumed normal broadcasting on August 27, 2010. Press reports in March 2011 show the station as silent once again although no silent notification is on file with the FCC. The station returned to the air in July 2013, retaining the WNKX callsign, but carrying a classic country format dubbed as \\"Cat Country 1570.\\" WMAK era On September 26, 2013, the station changed its call sign to the current WMAK, and installed a classic hits format. After stunting with Christmas music, WMAK debuted an all- bluegrass music format. Effective May 15, 2017, Grace Broadcasting sold WMAK and WOPC to Nunley Media Group, LLC for $100,000.

It takes the concept of wisdom deeper in the sense that it denotes a keenness of sense and intelligence applied to insight. Another definition refers to it as the \\"ability to recognize subtle differences between similar objects or ideas\\". It has also been described as a deeper level of internalization. Perspicacity is different from acuity, which also describes a keen insight, since it does not include physical abilities such as sight or hearing.  Concept  In 17th-century Europe, Ren√© Descartes devised systematic rules for clear thinking in his work Regul√¶ ad directionem ingenii (Rules for the direction of natural intelligence). In Descartes' scheme, intelligence consisted of two faculties: perspicacity, which provided an understanding or intuition of distinct detail; and sagacity, which enabled reasoning about the details in order to make deductions. Rule 9 was De Perspicacitate Intuitionis (On the Perspicacity of Intuition). He summarised the rule as In his study of the elements of wisdom, the modern psychometrician Robert Sternberg identified perspicacity as one of its six components or dimensions; the other five being reasoning, sagacity, learning, judgement and the expeditious use of information. In his analysis, the perspicacious individual is someone who In an article dated October 7, 1966, the journal Science discussed NASA scientist-astronaut program recruitment efforts: Being perspicacious about other people, rather than having false illusions, is a sign of good mental health. The quality is needed in psychotherapists who engage in person-to-person dialogue and counselling of the mentally ill. The artist Ren√© Magritte illustrated the quality in his 1936 painting Perspicacity. The picture shows an artist at work who studies his subject intently: it is an egg. But the painting which he is creating is not of an egg; it is an adult bird in flight. Perspicacity is also used to indicate practical wisdom in the areas of politics and finance.

She became popular for supporting roles like mother of Sultan Rahi in most of the Punjabi films of 1980s. Laila became well- known for one of the popular wedding songs of the film. She was given lead roles in films after the popularity of her wedding song in this film and Zarif who had a role of a Hindu was a great comedian of Pakistan film industry. He was the elder brother of famous comedian Munawar Zarif. Fazl Haq and Ghulam Mohammed were senior actors and were included in most of the films of that time. The great playback singer Inayat Hussain Bhatti also performed in this film. He was known as a film hero only for some films but a playback singer for many. The iconic actor of Pakistani cinema Allauddin was given the film's title role. His Punjabi dialogue spoken by the Sikhs became very popular. Film song Ajj aakhaan Waris Shah nu was a poem written by Amrita Pritam in reaction to Partition of India after her first-hand experience of the tragic events. She was loved on both sides of the border. As a token of respect and love, the Punjabi poets of Pakistan from Punjab Academy, Pakistan sent her chaddars (green silk sheets edged with gold) from the tombs of Waris Shah and fellow Sufi mystic poets Bulle Shah and Sultan Bahu. This touched her the most and Amrita Pritam had her picture taken with these chaddars.

Its last was assigned to the 4901st Support Wing (Atomic), stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 31 August 1961. Known as \\"The Megaton Blasters\\", the 4925th was responsible for the development flight testing of all USAF nuclear weapon delivery systems including conducting live test drops from 1951 though 1958. The Group was discontinued on April 1, 1961, when Air Force Systems Command replaced Air Research and Development Command and components of its mission were distributed among other units. History Established in 1948 as the 3170th Special Weapons Group following a decision to consolidate all USAF special weapons activities under AF Special Weapons Command. Was tasked with testing all aircraft in the United States inventory for nuclear weapons delivery capability. Its overall mission was specifically to: * Marry all nuclear weapon types to all suitable types of aircraft * Establish the ballistics of each type of nuclear weapon on precision bomb ranges * Support the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) with live test drops at Nevada and in the Pacific * Fly through and ‚Äúsample‚Äù highly radioactive nuclear ‚Äúclouds‚Äù after explosions at those test drops and collect atmospheric samples of nuclear materiel. The group also recommended military characteristics and requirements for special weapons, provided facilities for training programs, and maintained an instrumentation laboratory and a technical liaison with the Air Force Special Weapons Program (AFSWP), AEC, and others. The top bomber and fighter pilots in the USAF and expert support personnel were transferred to the 4925th Special Weapons Group. These included bomber, fighter, and helicopter pilots; bombardiers; nuclear project engineers; depot level modification personnel; aerial cameramen; and crew chiefs and crews. Each had to have AEC ‚ÄúQ‚Äù clearance, a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] that went back 15 years. 4925th Test Group (Nuclear) at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. In addition to two B-47s (not pictured), the group‚Äôs fleet included two Boeing B-52s (one is pictured in the rear) and three fighters ‚Äî from left, a Lockheed F-104, a Fiat G-91, and a North American F-100. The group was established within a double- barbed-wire-fence complex dubbed ‚ÄúArea Charlie‚Äù with a small sign on the gate reading ‚ÄúSanta Fe Operations‚Äù. In July 1951, the 4925th Special Weapons Group was redesignated the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) and continued as an important component of KAFB‚Äôs nuclear responsibilities. During the early 1950s the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) participated in the majority of atmospheric nuclear tests, both in the Pacific and in Nevada. The group completed nuclear live drops at both the Nevada and Pacific test complexes and ballistic drops, or duplicates of the real thing, at the Edwards AFB Precision Bomb Range, the AEC Salton Sea Precision Bomb Range in southeastern California, and the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) Bomb Range near Edwards AFB. The 4925th Test Group (Atomic) also participated in drops at the Navy Auxiliary Air Station Bomb Range, California, Tonopah Bomb Range, Nevada, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico (Hardison 1990), and at KAFB‚Äôs Practice Bomb Range on Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico. The group participated in AFSWC Development Directorate investigated projects such as adding a parachute to a bomb to delay delivery, which allowed for the combat crew to release the bomb and escape before it exploded. The goal of one of the early lay-down projects was to determine the feasibility of delivering a parachute-retarded thermonuclear weapon weighing more than 40,000 pounds, the heaviest nuclear weapons in the stockpile, from altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet. One early effort was the development of a system that could retard the fall of either a TX-14 or a TX-16 weapon, heavy airburst bombs, from altitudes of 40,000 feet to 4,000 feet in 167 seconds from a B-36 Peacemaker. Boeing B-47B 51-2047 assigned to the 4925th Test Group shown at a 1955 open house. The group tested the B-47 in carrying nuclear weapons. F-86E 51-2726. Used as a chase plane for B-36 operations. The F-86 was deemed too slow for tactical nuclear weapons delivery In 1956, however, AFSWC was directed to establish a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric tests. Thus, in 1956, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was created, holding equal stature to the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). At that point, the atmospheric test participation of the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) was cut back and the group focused on the aircraft/weapon marriage mission. The group evaluated equipment for the installation of special weapons into aircraft. This included sway braces, bomb suspension and control systems, pylons and racks, handling and loading equipment, and control and monitor apparatus. During 1956 the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) worked on equipment testing to provide single Mk-15 and Mk-21 capabilities for the B-52. Both configurations were in use by the end of 1956, and successful flight and drop tests continued into February 1957. The group also began testing the TX-28 with the swept-wing F-84F ‚ÄúThunderstreak.‚Äù Aircraft modifications included pylon and weapon loading and compatibility, proper functioning of the units, clearances, and complete electrical checks of the special weapons control. Flights determined aerodynamic loads, vibration, stability and control affects in straight and level, flight dive and LABS maneuvers. A new technological innovation in the early 1950s, LABS was a component of the flight control system; it controlled an aircraft automatically during low-altitude bombing. These test maneuvers were made at various true airspeeds, altitudes, and release and dive angles. In 1957, AFSWC, including the 4925th Test Group (Atomic), assisted the ADC with the loading of the first operational Genie rocket onto F-89J ‚ÄúScorpion‚Äù aircraft (Greene et al. 1957). The F-89J was the aircraft used for the live test fire of the Genie rocket at the Nevada Test Site and became the ADC‚Äôs first fighter-interceptor to carry nuclear armament. Other aircraft tested by the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) included B-29, B-50D Superfortress, B-36H Peacemaker, B-45, B-47 Stratojet, B-57, and B-66 bombers. These were paired with fission and thermonuclear bombs, both established and those in development. In 1956, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) took responsibility for the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling). In 1960, the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) moved from the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) and consolidated with other organizations into the 4925th Test Group (Atomic).

It survived several threats like the invasion of Imam Gran and the Ottoman Red Sea expansion, albeit Medri Bahri irretrievably lost its access to the Red Sea due to the latter. The relation to the Ethiopian empire in the south varied from time to time, ranging from independence to tributary status to de facto annexation. At first the residence of the Bahr Negash was at Debarwa, but during the 17th century it was relocated to the village of Tsazega due to the same-named clan taking control of the kingdom. History Origins and turbulent 16th century After the Aksumite empire, the area from the Eritrean highlands to the Red Sea was known as Ma'ikele Bahr (\\"between the seas/rivers,\\" i.e. the land between the Red Sea and the Mereb river). It was later renamed as the domain of the Bahr Negash (\\"Ruler of the sea\\"), the Medri Bahri (\\"Land of the Sea\\", \\"Sea land\\" in Tigrinya, although it included some areas like Shire on the other side of the Mereb, today in Ethiopia).Daniel Kendie, The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict 1941‚Äì2004: Deciphering the Geo-Political Puzzle. United States of America: Signature Book Printing, Inc., 2005, pp.17-8. The entire coastal domain of Ma'ikele Bahri was under the Adal Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badlay. The first time the title Bahr Negash appears is during the reign of emperor Zara Yaqob (r. 1433-1468), after his reconquest on behalf of the Ethiopian Empire, who perhaps even introduced that office. His chronicle explains how he put much effort into increasing the power of that office, placing the Bahr Negash above other local chiefs and eventually making him the sovereign of a territory covering the Shire, a region south of the Mareb river in what is now Ethiopia, The highlands(·ä®·â†·à≥) of what is now Eritrea including Hamasien, Seraye, To strengthen the imperial presence in Medri Bahri, Zara Yaqob also established a military colony consisting of Maya warriors from the south of his realm. In the 1520s, Medri Bahri was described by the Portuguese traveller and priest Francisco Alvares. The current Bahr Negash bore the name Dori and resided in Debarwa, a town on the very northern edge of the highlands. Dori was an uncle of emperor Lebna Dengel, to whom he paid tribute. These tributes were traditionally paid with horses and imported cloth and carpets. Dori was said to wield considerable power and influence, with his kingdom reaching almost as far north as Suakin, plus he was also a promoter of Christianity, gifting the churches everything they needed. By the time of Alvares' visit, Dori was engaged in warfare against some Nubians after the latter had killed his son. The Nubians were known as robbers and generally had a rather bad reputation. They originated somewhere five to six days away from Medri Bahri, possibly Taka (A historical province named after Jebel Taka near modern Kassala). The Bahre-Nagassi (\\"Kings of the Sea\\") alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances. Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal's forces, but later joined the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire front against Abyssinia in 1572. During the 16th century said Ottomans also began making inroads in the Red Sea area. The territory became an Ottoman province or eyalet known as the Habesh Eyalet. Massawa served as the new province's first capital. When the city became of secondary economic importance, the administrative capital was soon moved across the Red Sea to Jeddah. Its headquarters remained there from the end of the 16th century to the early 19th century, with Medina temporarily serving as the capital in the 18th century. Turks briefly occupied the highland parts of Baharnagash in 1559 and withdrew after they encountered resistance and pushed back by the Bahrnegash and highland forces. In 1578 they tried to expand into the highlands with the help of Bahr negus Yeshaq who had switched alliances due to power struggle, and by 1589 once again they were apparently compelled to withdraw their forces to the coast. After that Ottomans abandoned their ambitions to establish themselves on the highlands and remained in the lowlands until they left the region by 1872.Jonathan Miran Red Sea Citizens: Cosmopolitan Society and Cultural Change in Massawa. Indiana University Press, 2009, pp. 38-39 & 91 Google Books 17th century-1890 The Scottish traveler James Bruce reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from Abyssinia, noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict. The kingdom was briefly occupied in 1879, when Ethiopian Ras Alula seized control of the region after he broke his promise of reconciliation to Ras Woldemichael Solomon and imprisoned him. This occupation was nonetheless shortlived as the region became an Italian colony in 1890. Geography Bahta Hagos Medri Bahri was in the highlands of Eritrea. The districts of Hamasien, and Seraye were the main districts/provinces of the kingdom. In the language of Tigrinya language \\"Medri Bahri\\" means \\"Land of the Sea\\" in reference to the Red Sea which Eritrea has a long coastline of this sea. This kingdom had a border to the south with Tigray Region, a province of the Ethiopian Empire also known as Abyssinia.

Monley, an expert on filming in Africa, helped many of Hollywood's best known film directors and producers film on location throughout the continent, including Steven Spielberg, Otto Preminger, John Ford, and David Lean. Biography Early life Monley was born in Berlin, Germany on April 29, 1923. She fled Nazi Germany with her mother, eventually settling in Kenya Colony, which later became the independent nation of Kenya. Over time, Monley achieved fluency in the Swahili language and became an expert on East African cultures. Film career Monley took a position as a secretary in Nairobi. While working that job, Monley was hired in her first job involving film. Monley worked as a script supervisor and assistant for the 1950 movie, King Solomon's Mines. King Solomon's Mines shot on location throughout Kenya Colony, Belgian Congo and Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania). Once production had finished, Monley was hired in a similar position as assistant and script supervisor for the 1951 film The African Queen, directed by John Huston. A string of behind-the-scenes positions for American and British film productions soon followed including The Snows of Kilimanjaro in 1952, White Witch Doctor in 1953, and Mogambo, a 1953 movie directed by John Ford. In addition to her work with productions based in Africa, Monley worked outside Africa as well. She worked on two films produced in India, The Rains of Ranchipur, which was directed by Jean Negulesco and starred Lana Turner, and 1956's Bhowani Junction, a George Cukor-directed film adaptation of the novel. She also worked as the location manager for Lawrence of Arabia for two years. In 1960, Monley began a five film collaboration with director Otto Preminger as his production manager for Exodus. Monley subsequently worked as production manager for - The Cardinal in 1963, In Harm's Way in 1965, Bunny Lake Is Missing in 1965 and Hurry Sundown in 1967. Monley switched to associate producer for a number of films later in her career. Her associate production credits included the 1977 horror film The Pack; 1979's The Promise by Gilbert Cates; Champions in 1983; and Highlander in 1986. She used her expertise as both an associate producer and film scout for Mister Johnson, which was shot on location in Nigeria by Bruce Beresford. Monley produced the 1993 Walt Disney Pictures and Amblin Entertainment film, A Far Off Place, which starred Reese Witherspoon. The movie was adapted from the book of the same name, written by South African writer, Laurens van der Post. Her numerous other credits in other production roles included Billion Dollar Brain in 1967, The Black Windmill in 1974, The Man Who Would Be King in 1975, Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa in 1985, and Steven Spielberg's 1987 film adaption, Empire of the Sun. Monley was a recipient of the British Film Institute's lifetime achievement award. She donated her papers and writings related to her film work to the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. Eva Monley died at her home in Nanyuki, Kenya, on November 12, 2011, at the age of 88. The Location Managers Guild of America honored the memory of Eva Monley at their inaugural award show in 2013 by naming their honorary award to an industry professional that has demonstrated ‚Äòabove and beyond‚Äô support of the work of location professionals after her.About the Eva Monley Award Location Managers Guild of America Retrieved 2014-12-11 The first recipient of the award went to multiple Academy Award winning Director Alexander Payne for his masterful use of location as another character in movies such as Sideways, The Descendants, and Nebraska.

Early years  Pratt was born at 13 Brighton Road in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham, England. He received his secondary education at St. Philip's School in Edgbaston. His favourite subject was chemistry, but he suffered from poor eyesight, which affected his education. Pratt was a gifted musician and a proficient pianist from an early age. When he left school at 15, he wanted to pursue a career in chemistry and was apprenticed to a local chemical manufacturer. But with no formal qualifications in chemistry and a growing interest in music, he went on to pursue a musical career.Interview with Marcia Davies, Anthony Pratt's daughter ‚Äì August 2010.  Career  During the interwar years, Pratt became a musician earning a living playing piano recitals in country hotels and on cruise ships, where he travelled to places like New York and Iceland. Also an aspiring composer (he was a huge fan of Edward Elgar), he was at one time accompanist to the renowned soprano Kirsten Flagstad. During the Second World War, Pratt worked in an engineering factory in Birmingham that manufactured components for tanks. Working on a drilling machine, he found the work tedious, but it gave him time to think, including about the ideas behind Cluedo.  Cluedo ‚Äì or Murder at Tudor Close  It was during the Second World War that Pratt had the idea for a murder mystery board game. The idea for Cluedo came from his days spent playing musical concerts in country hotels where part of the evening's entertainment would have been murder mystery games. These would involve both actors and hotel guests playing the characters in a plot which involved the murder of one or more of the guests. The setting was a country house with its many sprawling rooms, with guests gathered for an evening's dining and socialising, but a body was found murdered and all the guests fell under suspicion. By putting clues together, the hotel guests must solve the mystery. These were very popular games at the time, and given this along with Pratt's love of detective fiction including that of his favourites Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie, the spark for Cluedo was created. At the time books like And Then There Were None and The Body in the Library were also enormously popular. Hence, in 1943, Anthony and his wife Elva (1913-1990) began designing a murder mystery board game. The original game was called \\"Murder!\\", with the artwork for the board itself designed by Elva. Pratt filed his original patent application on 1 December 1944. He had spoken to a close friend, Geoffrey Bull (who had invented the board game Buccaneer), and it was Bull who introduced him to Norman Watson, managing director of games manufacturer Waddingtons. In February 1945, Pratt demonstrated the game to Watson, who immediately saw the winning formula of the game and, after a few minor modifications, decided to go ahead and manufacture it. It was Waddingtons who renamed the game Cluedo (a combination of \\"Clue\\" and \\"Ludo\\", a Latin word meaning \\"I play\\"). But material shortages in post-war Britain meant the game did not go into production until 1949. Pratt was granted patent GB586817 'Improvements in Board Games' on 1 April 1947.  Later years  Anthony Pratt's grave at Bromsgrove cemetery, Worcestershire Elva Pratt's grave at Bromsgrove cemetery, Worcestershire After the end of the Second World War Pratt entered the British Civil Service working for the Ministry of Labour helping demobbed servicemen and women to return to peacetime work. In 1953, four years after Cluedo first went on sale, Waddingtons told Pratt that the game was not selling very well, particularly in America, and offered him a cheque for ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£105,800) for the overseas rights to Cluedo. This was a considerable sum and, with their daughter Marcia newly born, he accepted the money. Such a large sum of money meant it was no longer vital for him to work, and the money enabled him and his wife to buy a sweets and tobacco shop in Warwickshire where they settled for a while. However Elva was frequently ill and disliked her time there, and this prompted a move to Bournemouth, where they lived for over twenty years, initially letting holiday flats. It was early in this time that Pratt worked as a solicitor's clerk, an occupation he held for about three years before retiring around 1962 (aged 59). Eventually the Cluedo patent lapsed, and in 1980 Anthony and Elva moved back to Birmingham, where they both enjoyed their retirement years. He continued to play and enjoy music and indulged his love of books including detective fiction. Anthony Pratt developed Alzheimer's disease towards the end of his life and moved into a nursing home, where he died at the age of 90. He is buried in Bromsgrove Cemetery.

It is his last large-scale painting of South America, following pieces such as The Andes of Ecuador (1855) and The Heart of the Andes (1859). Like them, the painting is a composite of the many sketches and drawings Church made while traveling in South America twenty years earlier.  Analysis  The work differs in important ways from Church's earlier, monumental South American canvases. While a high degree of realism and attention to detail remains, the landscape in The River of Light is more local; it no longer attempts to capture numerous topographies or climate zones in one image. As a result, the composition is more intimate than other South American works. The National Gallery of Art notes that \\"the tightly focused realism, the overall tonal harmony and restrained coloration, and the compositional unity all lend a remarkable cohesiveness to the work\\". The vantage point is no longer high and detached, but seemingly low enough that a viewer might stand there. Details include a canoeist, a flock of birds over the river and two others (possibly the amethyst woodstar hummingbirdKelly, 67) perched close to the viewer, and a hut on the right bank. Church's once-stellar reception by the 1870s had diminished, though he was still prominent; his work was often criticized for an excess of detail and a sense of melodrama. In 1880 art critic William Crary Brownell called it \\"a magnificent drop-curtain. A drop- curtain may be the work of incontestable genius; it may have a thousand merits; ... it is simply not painting.\\"Kelly, 64 In the 1960s, Church scholar David C. Huntington offered interpretive reminders of the symbolism of Church's art for its 19th-century American audience, who were Christians optimistic about the future of their young country (though the Civil War, a decade past, tempered these feelings): As in The Andes of Ecuador, the sunlight forms a subtle cross. Huntington finds in the painting the influence of Gustave Dor√©'s prints for Paradise Lost, of engravings after J. M. W. Turner such as Bacchus and Ariadne, and illustrated books on the tropics, such as those by Paul Marcoy.Huntington, 105-106 Exhibition and provenance The painting was exhibited in New York in 1877 at the Century Association (called A Tropical Morning), and in 1878 at Exposition Universelle. William Earl Dodge, Jr. (1832‚Äì1903) was the first owner of the work and passed it to his descendants, who reported that the painting had once been called The Amazon. In 1965, it was given to the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, and purchased in December 1965 by the National Gallery of Art. The painting was restored in 1988.

It was discovered in November 2011 by Australian amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy. The comet's perihelion took it through the Sun's corona on 16 December 2011, after which it emerged intact, though greatly impacted by the event. As Comet Lovejoy was announced on the 16th anniversary of the SOHO satellite's launch it became known as \\"The Great Birthday Comet of 2011\\", and because it was visible from Earth during the Christmas holiday it was also nicknamed \\"The Great Christmas Comet of 2011\\".  Discovery  Comet Lovejoy was discovered on 27 November 2011 by Terry Lovejoy of Thornlands, Queensland, during a comet survey using a Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope and a QHY9 CCD camera. It is the third comet discovered by Terry Lovejoy. He reported that it was \\"a rapidly moving fuzzy object\\" of 13th magnitude, and additional observations were made by him over the next couple of nights. Independent confirmation of the comet did not come until 1 December, when it was observed by Alan Gilmore and Pamela Kilmartin at the Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand, using its McLellan Telescope. Upon confirmation, an official report was made to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, and the comet's existence was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 2 December. It is the first Kreutz-group comet discovered by ground-based observation in 40 years.  Observations  The first orbital elements using an assumed parabolic trajectory were published by Gareth Williams of the Minor Planet Center on 2 December, with an estimated perihelion of 0.0059 AU occurring near midnight UTC of 15/16 December. Further refinements were published during subsequent days, including one on 5 December, estimating perihelion at 0.0056 AU just before midnight on 15 December. On 11 December the first elliptical orbit was published, estimating perihelion at 0.0055 AU just after midnight on 16 December. In space, the comet first became visible to the STEREO-A spacecraft on 3 December, and to the SOHO spacecraft on 14 December. As the comet approached the Sun it was observed by eighteen instruments on six satellites: STEREO-A and -B, SOHO, SDO, Hinode and PROBA2. A small companion comet was detected in SOHO images on 14 December by Zhijian Xu, and later spotted by the twin STEREO spacecraft. It is believed to be a fragment of Comet Lovejoy that broke away several decades ago. This discovery was not unexpected, as Kreutz-group comets are often found with smaller companions. At its brightest, Comet Lovejoy had an apparent magnitude of between and , which is about as bright as the planet Venus. It is the brightest sungrazing comet ever observed by SOHO, and the brightest comet to appear since Comet McNaught of 2007, which shone at visual magnitude . Nevertheless, Lovejoy was largely invisible to the naked eye during its peak brightness due to its proximity to the Sun.  Perihelion  Comet Lovejoy reached perihelion on 16 December 2011 at 00:17 UTC, as it passed approximately above the Sun's surface at a speed of , or 0.18% the speed of light. It was not expected to survive the encounter due to extreme conditions in the corona, such as temperatures reaching more than one million kelvins and the exposure time of nearly an hour. However, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), as well as other Sun-monitoring spacecraft, observed the comet emerge from the corona intact. The STEREO and SOHO spacecraft continued to observe the comet as it moved away from the Sun. Before perihelion, the nucleus of Comet Lovejoy had been estimated to be between in diameter. Since the comet survived perihelion, it is thought that the nucleus must have been larger, perhaps up to . During the coronal passage, it is believed that a significant fraction of the comet's mass was burned off.  Outbound flight  The first ground-based observation of Comet Lovejoy post-perihelion occurred on 16 December at 19:55 UTC, when it was seen by Rick Baldridge and Brian Day of the Foothill Observatory. Baldridge estimated the comet at . The comet's discoverer, Terry Lovejoy, made a pair of observations on 17 December at 01:12 and 20:24 UTC, with apparent magnitudes estimated , respectively. Images taken on 20 December around 08:00 UTC suggested that the comet had undergone significant changes. Taken by Czech astronomer Jakub ƒåern√Ω using the robotic FRAM telescope at Pierre Auger Observatory, the images indicated that \\"the nucleus had apparently become bar-shaped and was accompanied by a bright tail ray.\\" Comet Lovejoy re-emerged as a naked eye object in the Southern Hemisphere around 21‚Äì22 December, when astronaut Dan Burbank photographed it from the International Space Station. Ground-based photographers continued to capture images of the comet, which had dimmed to around 4th magnitude. While Lovejoy would have continued to be visible to Southern Hemisphere observers into early 2012, large telescopes would have been required to see the comet by the time it crossed into the Northern Hemisphere in February. Some concern was expressed after perihelion that the stresses induced in the comet by its close approach to the Sun might result in its disintegration. That observers were unable to locate a distinct nucleus amidst the more visible tail furthered this idea; using observations from the Pierre Auger Observatory, Zdenƒõk Sekanina and Paul Chodas determined that, while the nucleus did survive perihelion for several days, following a significant outburst of dust on 19 December, the nucleus underwent a \\"cataclysmic fragmentation\\" event on 20 December and completely disappeared. In the event that some portion of the nucleus did survive, the eccentricity and inclination of Comet Lovejoy's orbit avoids significant perturbation from planets, which leaves the possibility that the comet may return for another perihelion. Using an epoch 2050 solution, Comet Lovejoy is estimated to have about a 622-year orbit and a return to perihelion around the year 2633.  Possible fragmentation history  An elliptical orbit calculated by Sekanina and Chodas in 2012 indicates that Comet Lovejoy is a fragment of an unrecorded sungrazer that reached perihelion around 1329. The fragmentation history suggested by these authors is that a parent sungrazer, likely the comet observed in 467 CE, split near the Sun due to tidal forces during its pass. The principal fragmentor a non- tidally fragmented portion of itreturned as the Great Comet of 1106, but a secondary fragment was imparted a longer orbital period and returned about 1329. This secondary also split at perihelion and its principal fragment will return around 2200, likely as a cluster of further fragments. A secondary fragment of this event left on a shorter period that theoretically should bring it back to the inner solar system during the early years of the 21st century. At some point after perihelion, this secondary fragment broke apart due to non-tidal forces and one of the resulting fragments became Comet Lovejoy. Other similar fragments may also exist and might return as sungrazers in the near future.

He is currently a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from the 8th District, which covers parts of Cheyenne near Interstate 25 and north of Pershing Boulevard to Four Mile Road. A lawyer by profession, Nicholas was elected in November 2010, then taking office early the next year. He was a candidate for re-nomination in the August 2012 Republican primary. Early life and career Born in Lander, Wyoming, Nicholas graduated from the University of Wyoming with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1982, followed three years later with a degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Political career Nicholas first ran for the 8th district in 2008 and lost to the incumbent Lori Millin, 2,438 votes to 2,271, but he succeeded two years later. He was unopposed in the 2010 primary and beat Democrat Ken McCauley 1,950 votes to 1,635. He is a member of the House Judiciary Committee. During his campaign, he emphasized economic growth, smaller government and environmental protections as his priorities, and he also wanted to push for a pilot charter school in Laramie County. On November 23, 2011, Nicholas was arrested in Boca Grande, Florida on the felony charge that he had assaulted his 19-year-old, mentally disabled son outside a restaurant. The charges were subsequently dropped upon review by the Florida State Attorney's office because of \\"insufficient evidence\\". Nicholas considers himself a fiscal conservative who supports cuts in the state bureaucracy and increases in the rainy day fund to an amount equal to two years of current state spending. \\"There is no government agency that will not spend all that you give it, and it's hard as a legislator, if you see a pot of money there, not to spend it. So I'm a strong advocate of saving any monies that we possibly can,\\" Nicholas told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. Nevertheless, he indicated that he could support a small increase in the gasoline tax to fund highway projects. In 2012, Nicholas worked on a juvenile justice bill that would increase the confidentiality for young persons charged in criminal cases. He was reported as supporting changes in the educational system with less reliance on standardized testing: \\"We just have to do more than test- based criteria. It has to be more comprehensive than that.\\" Nicholas was opposed in the August 2012 Republican primary by Keith Eldred and Margaret Wall. In the general election Nicholas faced Kathleen Peterson.

Childhood Prem Ram was the eldest of four sons born to Shri Malik Ram Dubey, the Gauntia (chief village headman) family of Anterdol Dandapat (chief village of a collection of 18 villages) presently Budhianchal, submerged in the Hirakud. His happy childhood was spent playing with his younger brothers in the jungles of the Guja mountains (a peak of which is now seen in the middle of the Hirakud dam's reservoir), racing horses, feeding on sweet tasting Char fruits and underwater hide and seek. Early education Shri PR Dubey had his education at Guhalpada for initial three years at Anterdol. Thereafter, he used to travel 1.5 miles on foot everyday to Balanda village till he was 7 years old. Thereafter, he was sent to Sambalpur to join Class IV at Zilla School. He continued his education till Matriculation at the Zilla School. At this time, the Hirakud dam was proposed to be constructed. if the Hirakud were to be constructed, Antardol Dandapat and several other villages will be submerged completely in its backwaters. Shri Harekrushna Mahatab, the first Chief Minister of Orissa pressurised Shri Bodhram Dubey, who was an uncle to Shri Prem Ram, and the first Education Minister of Orissa to allow the Hirakud dam to be constructed. Though Shri Bodhram did not budge initially, circumstances and pressure from Government made Shri Bodhram Dubey to remain absent from Sambalpur, while the Government officials captured the lands of Antardol Dandapat and other villages. All this while young Prem Ram's perceptive mind was a witness to the deceit and chicanery perpetrated by the Government to construct the Hirakud by depriving several thousand people of their land and subsistence. Meanwhile, Prem Ram had to shift to East Hostel, Ravenshaw College for B.A, Hons. His performance at Ravenshaw College gave him the reference of his Philosophy Professor, Dr. Rajendra Ratha from Patna and he was admitted to Banaras Hindu University, Banaras. Prem Ram Dubey in BHU He simultaneously pursued Masters in Law, Philosophy, Music and Fine Arts. He secured First position in Masters in Law and won the Benaras Hindu University's Gold Medal. However, Shri PR Dubey could never collect the Medal as he was called home as construction of the Hirakud dam had started and evacuation orders had been issued. These happenings and injustice meted out to the people of Antardol Dandapat and other villages which were submerged in the Hirakud had a great impact on the young mind of Prem Ram and sowed the seeds of revolution. In 1955, he was married to Shashikala, the daughter of eminent Freedom Fighter and close associate of Gandhiji, Late Dr Jwala Prasad Mishra and Smt Vedvati Mishra. Professional career \\"FARMER, TEACHER, LEADER, LAWYER, SCHOLAR\\" Shri PR Dubey, was initially, forced by his father to follow the family occupation of cultivating paddy and he got a copious harvest in his very first attempt. But an ambitious law student like him could never spend his life tilling the land, his destiny was to become the flag bearer of the greatest movement of the people of Western Orissa for their rights. In 1967, he joined Sambalpur Law College as a part-time Lecturer. Because of internal politics, he resigned the post, but returned shortly thereafter having been elected as the Senior Senate Member and Syndicate of the Sambalpur University. After a short tenure in this position, he became the Dean of Law at Sambalpur University. He also accepted the position of Principal of the very same Sambalpur Law College from where he had to resign following college politics; such was the fighter spirit of the great Shri Prem Ram Dubey.Principal http://www.pucl.org/from-archives/Academia/orissa-repression.htm The urge to reach out to the society made him to join the Congress Party. Shri PR Dubey's main source of inspiration for this was Late Shri Bodhram Dubey, who was the regional President of Congress then. With Shri Bodhram Dubey, he got an opportunity to attend the Simla National Summit of Congress. At Simla, he met with former Prime Minister Shri Chandrashekhar and shared his vision with him. But his tenure with the Congress also revealed to him that he had been sadly disillusioned about the Congress and that most of the Congress workers were just puppets in the larger power game. Most of the leaders and politicians were not dedicated towards the upliftment of the masses or the people of Kosal but were just interested in filling their pockets. This made him to start his own political party in 1988, by the name of Western Orissa Peoples' Front and finally known as the Kosal Party in 1992.http://odishaportal.com/Politics/index Whatever time remained from his larger goals in life was devoted to the practice and study of law. Shri PR Dubey fought some historic cases of Sambalpur. The Siddheswar Berna (Mandir) case related to the capture of Temple's land by some Muslims, with aid of the able advice and loquacious arguments of Shri PR Dubey, the case was adjudicated in favour of Shri PR Dubey and this victory had excited the masses to such an extent that as an honour to Shri PR Dubey, he was made to sit on an elephant's back and the procession was taken around the town. An avid scholar of History, Shri Dubey's historical researches find mention in several historical books and treatises like \\"Dakshin Kosal Ka Prachin Itihas\\"PREVIEW by Dr. P.L.Diwan. His article \\"The politics of Language\\" traces the history of the Oriya language that Oriya was planted as spoken language of Sambalpur and Kalahandi districts in the Records of British Government. Subsequently, Sambalpuri speaking regions were claimed as Oriya speaking regions. This sounded the death knell for the centuries-old Kosal state being eclipsed and ruled by the Oriya speaking people. Later political activities Shri. Prem Ram Dubey was first person to feel the Need of Kosal and submitted a memorandum to President of India. Jharkhand party's claimed over Sambalpur and Sundergarh for inclusion into Jharkhand. The Kosal Sammelani(Earlier group formed by Sri.Prem Ram Dubey) urged,the state government and union government not to enter into any negotiation with any claimant for the transfer of any part of proposed Kosal state Mr Prem asserted that while Punjab has only 46,000 km2, Kosal region having 75,000 sq. km and a population of one crore has not been made into a state. He had also published the first newspaper for the Kosal state \\"Kosal Khabar\\". He also constituted the \\"Kosal Sena\\". He authored a book Hame Kosli Hamar Bhasa Kosli. and \\"Why Kosal State\\". His work for the upliftment of hundreds of bidi workers in the Kosal region is noteworthy. This was a part of work done by Shri PR Dubey's Kosal Party for civil welfare. All bidi workers were given separate identity cards at the cost of the Kosal Party and a meeting was held on each Saturday for solving and addressing their grievances. Many political parties with rowdy approach to the movement entered the kosal movement in recent decades. But none of them could gain national interest and kept blaming the forerunners of the movement for their failure. Death Prem Ram Dubey died on 17 September 2012 after prolonged illness. Courts in Sambalpur were suspended for a day in his honour and condolence meetings were held at the Sambalpur Bar Association and at many places of Shri Prem Ram Dubey used to frequent.

It was founded by Ma Weidu in 18th 1997,http://www.guanfumuseum.org.cn/ and it was among the first private museums in the People's Republic of China. The Guanfu Museum is a non- profit organization and it has a qualification of Independent Legal Entity.  History  The museum was previously located on the Liulichang Street, with mostly exhibits of ceramic, domestic furniture, jade, lacquer, metalwork, closionner enamel, classical window and door, and contemporary oil painting. The museum was then moved to Nanxiaojie Street and again to Dashanzi in 2004, where the museum is currently located.  Exhibition Halls  Ceramics Hall Inside the Ceramics Hall The Ceramics Hall exhibits are masterpieces of antique Chinese ceramics that span more than 1,000 years, between the Tang and Qing dynasties. Many of the porcelain items on display represent the most typical features of the fine ceramic of the Song dynasty, especially highlights the Five Famous Kilns, namely Ru kiln, Jun kiln, Guan kiln, Ge kiln and Ding kiln. Within this exhibition, the categories include celadon, monochrome glaze and polychrome glaze, tri-colored pottery; under glaze cobalt-blue and under glaze copper red; famille-rose. Furniture Hall Chinese ancient study room China has a long history of furniture-making. Furniture from the Ming and Qing periods in many ways represent the culmination of Chinese furniture-making skills, and they have various different features. Ming furniture features simple, smooth, and flowing lines, and plain and elegant ornamentation, fully bringing out the special qualities of frame-structure furniture. Influenced by China's burgeoning foreign trade and advanced craftsmanship techniques, furniture of the Qing Dynasty period turned to rich and intricate ornamentation, along with coordinated engraved designs. Because of the high level of development of Chinese furniture in the Ming and Qing dynasties, most Chinese furniture design today follows in the tradition from these two periods. The Furniture gallery in Guanfu Museum contains 6 smaller exhibiting halls and a special Chinese ancient study room, displaying over 500 pieces of furniture designed during the Ming and Qing periods. Craftsmanship Hall The traditional craftsmanship exhibition includes jade, gold and silver and copper artworks, cloisonne enamel, lacquer, and precious wood with the ancient technique of the 'hundred treasures inlay'. The room \\"Song Xi Cao Tang\\" restores the ancient scholar's studio. Doors and Windows Hall On the second floor there is an exhibition of finely carved doors and window frames. There is also new addition of a collection of oil paintings and sculptures by contemporary Chinese artists. Ticketing An adult ticket to this museum costs 100 RMB (available on the day of issue). Half-price ticket:50 RMB per person includes seniors (60 and over), students (except for postgraduate and PhD students), teachers, soldiers, the disabled and the staff in museum and heritage institution (Valid ID or certification is required).

Completed in 1942 as part of World War II, it is located on on the oceanside area of the island, formerly part of the Peaks Island Military Reservation. It is named for Harry Lee Steele, who was a Coast Artillery officer during World War I. It was armed with two 16-inch MkIIMI guns and, with a 12-inch gun battery at Fort Levett on Cushing Island, replaced all previous heavy guns in the Harbor Defenses of Portland.Berhow, p. 202 It was built to protect Casco Bay, particularly Portland harbor, from Kennebunk to Popham Beach in Phippsburg. According to Kim MacIsaac and historian Joel Eastman in An Island at War, ‚ÄúBattery Steele is not only the largest gun battery built on Peaks Island, but also an example of the largest battery ever built anywhere in the United States.‚Äù In 1995, after decades of non-use, the Peaks Island Land Preserve, a community land preservation group, formed to purchase the area and forever preserve it as a public space. On October 20, 2005, the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other coast defense structures on the island include fire control towers and the counterweight for a disappearing searchlight tower (it \\"disappeared\\" when folded down). Associated batteries Battery Steele was part of a comprehensive program begun in 1940 to replace obsolete coast defenses, many of which dated from the Endicott Program of 1885-1905. In the Harbor Defenses of Portland, the only large-caliber (8-inch or larger) pre-war battery still in use by 1944 was Battery Foote at Fort Levett, Cushing Island, casemated like Battery Steele to resist air attack and armed with two 12-inch guns on long-range carriages.Berhow, p. 224 Another two-gun 16-inch battery, Battery Construction Number (BCN) 101, was planned for the Cape Elizabeth Military Reservation near Two Lights State Park, but was cancelled as the threat to the US East Coast from surface ships was nearly non-existent by 1943. Smaller batteries were also built during World War II. Three two-gun 6-inch batteries were built in Casco Bay, but only one of these was armed. The armed battery was Battery Cravens (BCN 203), also on Peaks Island, now part of a private residence. The other two were BCN 201 in Two Lights State Park and BCN 202 on Jewell Island.Berhow, pp. 202-203, 224-228FortWiki article on Peaks Island Military Reservation Older 6-inch gun batteries retained in service in Casco Bay included two two-gun batteries at Fort McKinley on Great Diamond Island and Fort Levett on Cushing Island. Three older 3-inch gun batteries were retained at Fort Williams near Portland Head Light, Fort Preble in South Portland, and Fort Lyon on Cow Island. Three new two-gun 3-inch batteries were constructed during World War II, on Peaks Island, Long Island, and Great Chebeague Island. Positions for a total of ten Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries with 90 mm guns were constructed in Casco Bay. Each battery was authorized four 90 mm guns, two on fixed mounts and two on towed mounts; the actual number of guns on hand for each battery may have varied. The guns were dual-purpose, able to fire against air or surface targets. The batteries were at Long Island (2), Great Chebeague Island (1), Bailey Island (1), Peaks Island (2), Jewell Island (2), Fort Levett (1), and Fort Williams (1). All US coast defenses were abandoned and most of the guns scrapped shortly after World War II.

Colonial liberalism was a unique movement that was unlike anything in any other country. This movement led to particular approaches to education, trade, industrial relations and economic management being developed which were used by the Australian colonies and later the federated Commonwealth of Australia. This radical movement helped give birth to the foundations of the Australian ideals of democracy, egalitarianism and the 'Fair Go' in life. Colonial liberalism had a major impact in the Australian colonies until the labour strikes of the 1890s led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian labour movement. The Australian gold rush (starting in 1851) led to a huge influx of emigrants to the colonies, including a significant number of Chartists and Liberals. The liberals were used to fighting the conservative forces of society, and demanding political reform such as the Reform Acts 1832. The chartists in Britain were unable to obtain the same rights. In Australia, there were very few conservative forces to rail against. Because of the semi-universal suffrage obtained by the colonies in the 1850s, the liberal and chartists were able to effect widespread change and gain seats in parliament. Colonial liberals had majorities in the governments of NSW, Victoria and South Australia by 1860. These governments instituted compulsory, secular state schools, built railways, and promoted prosperity for the middle and working classes; the vast majority of the population. Alfred Deakin, who identified as a liberal, wrote in December 1900: > A Colonial Liberal is one who favours State interference with liberty and > industry at the pleasure and in the interest of the majority, while those > who stand for the free play of individual choice and energy are classed as > Conservatives.

In this period conflict developed from minor raids to major conflicts, incorporating many of the innovations of continental warfare. In the Early Middle Ages war on land was characterised by the use of small war- bands of household troops often engaging in raids and low level warfare. The arrival of the Vikings brought a new scale of naval warfare, with rapid movement based around the Viking longship. The birlinn, which developed from the longship, became a major factor in warfare in the Highlands and Islands. By the High Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of the \\"common army\\", mainly of poorly armoured spearmen and bowmen. After the \\"Davidian Revolution\\" of the twelfth century, which introduced elements of feudalism to Scotland, these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights. Feudalism also introduced castles into the country, originally simple wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but these were replaced in the thirteenth century with more formidable stone \\"enceinte\\" castles, with high encircling walls. In the thirteenth century the threat of Scandinavian naval power subsided and the kings of Scotland were able to use naval forces to help subdue the Highlands and Islands. Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by Robert I of Scotland at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence. He adopted a policy of slighting castles and made use of naval power to support his forces, beginning to develop a royal Scottish naval force. In the Late Middle Ages under the Stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly men-at-arms and archers, hired by bonds of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period. New \\"livery and maintenance\\" castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons. The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes, the extensive use of artillery, and they built up a formidable navy. However, one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and King James IV. Early Middle Ages The battle scene from the Aberlemno Pictish stone, generally presumed to show the Battle of Dunnichen in 865 Warriors In the politically divided world of early medieval Scotland the nucleus of most armed forces was a leader's bodyguard or war-band. In the Brittonic languages, this was called the teulu, as in teulu Dewr (the \\"War- band of Deira\\"). In Latin the most common word in this period is tutores, and derives from the Latin verb tueor, meaning \\"defend, preserve from danger\\".L. Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550‚Äì850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), , p. 56. In peace-time, the war-band's activity was centred around the \\"Great Hall\\". Here, in both Germanic and Celtic cultures, the feasting, drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war-band's integrity would take place. In the contemporaneous Old English epic poem Beowulf, the war-band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber.L. Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550‚Äì850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), , pp. 248‚Äì9. It is not likely that any war-band in the period exceeded 120‚Äì150 men, as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain.L. Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550‚Äì850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), , p. 157. The war-band was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size. These wider forces depended on the obligations to defend a province or kingdom by land and sea. Early sources from D√°l Riata indicate an attempt to define this as an obligation based on landholding, with obligations to provide a specified number of men or ships based on the amount of land held by an individual.A. A. M. Duncan, \\"The Making of the Kingdom\\" in, R. Mitchison, ed., Why Scottish History Matters (Edinburgh: Saltire Society, 1997), , p. 13.

These images may show infantry in formation, or gathered together for protection, and they show mounted troops, sometimes heavily armoured, suggesting a mounted warrior elite.D. Mersey, Warriors (Conway: Maritime Press, 2007), , p. 240. Hill forts Early fortifications in Scotland, particularly in the north and west, included modest stone built towers known as brochs and duns and, particularly in the south and east larger hill forts,S.

Laing, The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, C. AD 400‚Äì1200 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 2006), , p. 34. The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than it was in contemporaneous Anglo-Saxon England, and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires, suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain. Ships Modern replica of a Viking Knarr Sea power may also have been important. Irish annals record an attack by the Picts on Orkney in 682, which must have necessitated a large naval force,J. N. G.

Ships were also vital in the amphibious warfare in the Highlands and Islands and from the seventh century the Senchus fer n-Alban indicates that D√°l Riata had a ship-muster system that obliged groups of households to produce a total of 177 ships and 2,478 men.

The Viking raids and invasions of the British Isles were based on superior sea-power, which enabled the creation of the thalassocracies (sea-based lordships) of the north and west. The long-ship, the key to their success, was a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around.\\"Skuldelev 2 ‚Äì The great longship\\", Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde, retrieved 25 February 2012.N.

In this period it continued to be mustered by the earls and they often led their men in battle, as was the case in the Battle of the Standard in 1138. It would continue to provide the vast majority of Scottish national armies, potentially producing tens of thousands of men for short periods of conflict, into the early modern era.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 23. There also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of feudal troops. The introduction of feudalism to Scotland is usually attributed to the Davidian Revolution of the twelfth century. When David I acceded to the Scottish throne in 1124 after spending much of his life living as a baron in England, he brought with him a number of Anglo-Norman vassals, to whom he distributed lands and titles, first in the lowlands and borders and then later in buffer zones in the North and West. Geoffrey Barrow wrote that among other changes this brought \\"fundamental innovations in military organization\\". These included the knight's fee, homage and fealty, as well as castle-building and the regular use of professional cavalry,G. W. S. Barrow, \\"David I of Scotland: The Balance of New and Old\\", in G. W. S. Barrow (ed.), Scotland and Its Neighbours in the Middle Ages (London: Continuum, 1992), , pp. 9‚Äì11. as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis. David's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights, but the vast majority of his forces were the \\"common army\\" of poorly armed infantry, capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare, but only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field, as they managed to do critically in the wars of independence at Stirling Bridge in 1297 and Bannockburn in 1314. Castles Castles, in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands.G. G. Simpson and B. Webster, \\"Charter Evidence and the Distribution of Mottes in Scotland,\\" in R. Liddiard, ed., Anglo-Norman Castles (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2003), , p. 225.C. J. Tabraham, Scotland's Castles (London: Batsford, 2005), , p. 11.L. E. Hull, Britain's Medieval Castles (Westport: Praeger, 2006), , p. xxiv. These were primarily wooden motte-and- bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 21. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.C. J. Tabraham, Scotland's Castles (London: Batsford, 2005), , p. 16. Dunstaffnage Castle, one of the oldest surviving \\"castles of enceinte\\", mostly dating from the thirteenth century In England many of these constructions were converted into stone \\"keep-and-bailey\\" castles in the twelfth century, but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of \\"enceinte\\", with a high embattled curtain wall. In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles, often larger and providing defence, lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre. By 1200 these included fortifications at Ayr and Berwick.C. J. Tabraham, Scotland's Castles (London: Batsford, 2005), , p. 12. In the wars of Scottish Independence Robert I adopted a policy of castle destruction, rather than allow fortresses to be easily taken or retaken by the English and held against him, beginning with his own castles at Ayr and Dumfries,J. S. Hamilton, The Plantagenets: History of a Dynasty (London: Continuum, 2010), , p. 116. and including Roxburgh and Edinburgh.D. Cornell, Bannockburn: the Triumph of Robert the Bruce (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009), , p. 124. Marine forces In the Highlands and Islands, the longship was gradually succeeded by (in ascending order of size) the birlinn, highland galley and lymphad,S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 2‚Äì3. which, were clinker-built ships, usually with a centrally-stepped mast, but also with oars that allowed them to be rowed. Like the longship, they had a high stem and stern, and were still small and light enough to be dragged across portages, but they replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century.\\"Highland Galleys\\" Mallaig Heritage Centre, retrieved 25 February 2012. They could fight at sea, but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies. However, they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape.J. E. A. Dawson, The Politics of Religion in the Age of Mary, Queen of Scots: The Earl of Argyll and the Struggle for Britain and Ireland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 54. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of D√°l Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers.G. Williams, \\"Land assessment and the silver economy of Norse Scotland\\", in G. Williams and P. Bibire, eds, Sagas, Saints and Settlements (Leiden: Brill, 2004), , pp. 66‚Äì8. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to feudal obligations, with Celtic-Scandinavian lords, who had previously contributed as a result of a general levy on landholding, coming to hold their lands in exchange for specified numbers and sizes of ships supplied to the king. This process probably began in the thirteenth century, but would be intensified under Robert I.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), , p. 375. The importance of these ships was underlined by their becoming common in depictions on grave markers and in heraldry throughout the Highlands and Islands.D. Goudsward, The Westford Knight and Henry Sinclair: Evidence of a fourteenth Century Scottish Voyage to North America (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010), , p. 112.

The latter took personal command of a large naval force which sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera in 1249, intended to transport his army in a campaign against the Kingdom of the Isles, but he died before the campaign could begin.J. Hunter, Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (London: Random House, 2011), , pp. 106‚Äì111.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 147. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the thirteenth century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters. These included king Hakon Hakonsson's Krists√∫√∞in, built at Bergen from 1262‚Äì3, which was long, of 37 rooms.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660‚Äì1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , pp. 74‚Äì5. In 1263 Hakon responded to Alexander III's designs on the Hebrides by personally leading a major fleet of forty vessels, including the Krists√∫√∞in, to the islands, where they were swelled by local allies to as many as 200 ships.P. J. Potter, Gothic Kings of Britain: the Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016‚Äì1399 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008), , p. 157. Records indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr, but he avoided a sea battle. Defeat on land at the Battle of Largs and winter storms forced the Norwegian fleet to return home, leaving the Scottish crown as the major power in the region and leading to the ceding of the Western Isles to Alexander in 1266.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 153. Late Middle Ages Armies The Battle of Otterburn (1388) in a miniature from Jean Froissart, Chroniques Scottish victories in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries have been seen as part of a wider \\"infantry revolution\\", that saw a decline in the primacy of the mounted knight on the battlefield. However, it has been pointed out that Scottish medieval armies had probably always been dependent on infantry forces.R. W. Kaeuper, Violence in Medieval Society (Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2000), , p. 42. In the late medieval period Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years' War.H.-Henning Kort√ºm, Transcultural Wars from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2006), , p. 51. Like the English, the Scots deployed mounted archers, and even spearmen, who were particularly useful in the mobile raids that characterised border warfare, but like the English they fought on foot.P. Armstrong, Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , p. 24. By the second half of the fourteenth century, in addition to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12‚Äì14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.P. Armstrong, Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , p. 85.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 108. There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of to in the later fifteenth century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, but this does not appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early sixteenth century.J. Cooper, Scottish Renaissance Armies 1513‚Äì1550 (Botley: Osprey, 2008), , p. 23. There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield. Scottish archers were mainly drawn from the border regions, with those from Selkirk Forest gaining a particularly reputation. They became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the fifteenth century, in order to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the Garde √âcossaise.P. Contamine, \\"Scottish soldiers in France in the second half of the fifteenth century: mercenaries, immigrants, or Frenchmen in the making?\\" in G. G. Simpson, ed., The Scottish Soldier Abroad, 1247‚Äì1967 (Edinburgh: Rowman & Littlefield, 1992), , pp. 16‚Äì30. Fortification Ravenscraig Castle, perhaps the first fortification in the British Isles to take account of gunpowder artillery: the large D-plan bastion towers can be seen on either wing After the Wars of Independence, new castles began to be built, often on a grander scale as \\"livery and maintenance\\" castles, to house retained troops, like Tantallon, Lothian and Doune near Stirling, rebuilt for Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany in the fourteenth century. The largest number of Late Medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles, about 800,A. Emery, Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300‚Äì1500: Northern England (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), , p. 26. were of the tower house design.G.

Toy, Castles: Their Construction and History (New York: Dover Publications, 1985), , p. 225. The defences of tower houses were primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties and were not intended to put up significant opposition to an organised military assault, leading historian Stuart Reid to characterise them as \\"defensible rather than defensive\\".S.

They were typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn, a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely, but not necessarily intended for serious defence.S.

They were built extensively on both sides of the border with England, and James IV's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region.I. D. Whyte, and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Routledge, 1991) , p. 76.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 6. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture, with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of \\"keyhole\\" gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls being adapted to resist bombardment. Ravenscraig, Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating \\"D-shape\\" bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 27. Towards the end of the period royal builders in Scotland adopted European Renaissance styles in castle design. The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at Linlithgow, Holyrood, Falkland and the remodelled Stirling Castle, begun by James IV.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald and A. J. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450‚Äì1650, Volume 1 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), , p. 166. A strong influence from France and the Low Countries can be seen in the fashionable design of a quadrangular court with stair-turrets on each corner.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 34. However, these were adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl).D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600‚Äì1540, Volume 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 391‚Äì2. Siege engines and artillery The Wars of Independence brought the first recorded instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland. Edward I used a range of siege engines, which were carefully constructed, transported, deployed, dismantled and stored for reuse. This began with the siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300. Here, after the failure of an initial assault, a small rock-throwing engine was employed, while three large engines (probably trebuchet, using a counter-weight mechanism), were constructed. Their destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender. Edward's armies deployed several such engines, often named, with \\"Warwolf\\", one of 17 used in the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304, being the best known (currently considered the largest trebuchet ever built). They also deployed lighter bolt-shooting balistas, belfry siege towers and on one occasion a covered sow. Some of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick, the future Robert I, who was present on the English side.D. Cornell, Bannockburn: The Triumph of Robert the Bruce (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009), , pp. 15‚Äì16. Scottish armies, with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault, blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics. Robert I is known to have employed siege engines against the English, but often with little success, as at Carlisle in 1315 where his siege tower floundered in mud.M. Brown, Scottish Baronial Castles 1250‚Äì1450 (Botley: Osprey, 2009), , pp. 33‚Äì6. The disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I. Mons Meg at Edinburgh Castle, with its 20\\" (50 cm) calibre cannonballs Edward I had the major ingredients for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably to produce a form of Greek fire, to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines.M. Prestwich, Edward I (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1988), , p. 501. The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade. The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines.J. A. Wagner, Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years War (London: Greenwood, 2006), , p. 144. The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341. Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century.P. Purton, A History of the Late Medieval Siege, 1200‚Äì1500 (Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2009), , p. 402. The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery.D. H. Caldwell, \\"The Scots and guns\\", in A. King and M. A. Penman, eds, England and Scotland in the Fourteenth Century: New Perspectives (Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2007), , pp. 60‚Äì72. James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland.J. Kinard, Artillery: An Illustrated History of its Impact (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2007), , p. 47. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some of the dangers of early artillery, when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460.C. T. Allmand, The Hundred Years War: England and France at War, c. 1300-c. 1450 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), , p. 100. James III also experienced ill-fortune, when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 19. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 76. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.S. Tucker, Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010), , p. 156. Navy the Great Michael, the largest ship in the world when launched in 1511 English naval power was vital to Edward I's successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660‚Äì1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 74‚Äì90. Part of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318. After the establishment of Scottish independence, Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i‚Äìxii. James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424, he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429. The office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel. James IV put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven in May 1504, and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie.N. Macdougall, James IV (East Lothian: Tuckwell, 1997), p. 235. The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the Royal Scottish Navy, including the Margaret, and the carrack Michael or Great Michael.T. C. Smout, Scotland and the Sea (Edinburgh: Rowman and Littlefield, 1992), , p. 45. The latter, built at great expense at Newhaven and launched in 1511, was in length, weighed 1,000 tons, had 24 cannon, and was, at that time, the largest ship in Europe.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 33‚Äì4. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king in his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts Scandinavia and the Baltic. In the Flodden campaign the fleet consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft. After a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war. After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael, and perhaps other ships, were sold to the French and the king's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516.

He had represened Zimbabwe at Under-19 level. ESPNCricinfo Profile:Kevin Kasuza ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 11 December 2011 Early life Kevin is the first from his family to play cricket, and he first encountered the game at Chirowakamwe Primary School in Mutare, where the coach was Foster Mupita. Mupita, first impressed upon Kevin the need to work really hard to succeed in cricket. He progressed to Mutare Boys High School, Farai Chari being the coach here. Both men played a vital part in developing Kevin's skills. He progressed very quickly, and at Under-13 level was already representing the Manicaland age-group team. He continued to represent them from Under-13 to Under-19 level ‚Äì and he still qualifies for their Under-19 team. He scored centuries for their Under-14 and Under-19 teams. Kevin started playing club cricket in Mutare when he was in Form Two, playing his first club match at Mutare Sports Club, but for Titans against the home side. In his early years with school and club he used to keep wicket as well, but over the years he probably wisely decided to concentrate on batting.

Retrieved 1 January 2012 On his first-class cricket debut for Mountaineers on 7 February 2011, Kasuza missed a hundred by only 8 runs and scored a fine 92 on debut. He and Tendai Chatara's five-for gave Mountaineers a point over Matabeleland Tuskers. Chatara's five give Mountaineers a point over Tuskers ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 11 December 2011 The first of his twin tons within two weeks that brought him into the limelight was a 132* in a Logan Cup match for Mountaineers. Against Mid-West Rhinos, in Kwekwe, the opposition scored 309, with a century for Gary Ballance ‚Äì and Kevin admitted to dropping him before he had scored. In reply, Mountaineers had six wickets down for 77, although Kevin, who had gone in at number three, was still there. Shingi Masakadza stayed with him for a while, but otherwise his only real support came from the last man, Tapiwa Mufudza, with whom he added 92. Kevin finished with 132 not out, out of 224. A poor batting performance in the second innings allowed Mountaineers to come through on the final day and win by three wickets. Although Kevin made only 27 this time, it is quite clear that without his first-innings century Mountaineers would have lost the match. That Kevin considered the finest performance of his career. He feels that having dropped Gary Ballance put him under pressure, but it spurred him on to put the matter right and score a century himself. Querl stars in big Tuskers win ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 11 December 2011 The second ton came within two-week of each other, this time in a Pro40 match against the Southern Rocks. This time the score was 129*. He scored 129 out of a total of 229, which was enough to win the match for his team. Again, had Kevin gone cheaply, it is highly unlikely Mountaineers could have won that match. He had done it again for his team, showing not only tremendous talent but also a magnificent temperament in a crisis. Kasuza stars in extraordinary victory ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 11 December 2011 Kasuza said that his sudden burst in batting form was due to his vying for fitness more than before, and that his coach Gary Brent had always told him that if he had to get to hundreds, then he would have to stay fit. Youthful sensation from Manicaland: Kevin Kasuza Zimbabwe Cricket Official Website. Retrieved 11 December 2011 In December 2011, he further made a case for his consideration for selection with another fine century for Mountaineers in the Coca-Cola Pro50 Championship. His 110* was the main architect behind a total of 199. The ton was scored off only 91 balls and just stunned the opposing Matabeleland Tuskers' bowlers.

The pass itself is a famous pass in the Great Wall known as the ninth pass under the heaven. The Village of Niangziguan is also known as \\"Village of Weize\\" () because it is located next to Mianshui River () and the bank of the river is covered with reeds. File:Niangziguan(Â®òÂ≠êÂÖ≥).jpg  Layout  Niangziguan is made up of Big Mouth Village (Â§ßÂè£Êùë), Small Mouth Village (Â∞èÂè£Êùë) and Village of Niangziguan. These three villages are located end-to-end in either bank of the 2000-meter-long Mianshui River. Most of the villagers are the generations of the soldiers who migrated to guard the pass in Qing Dynasty. There is an old street in the village that begins with the eastern Wenchang Ge (ÊñáÊòåÈòÅ) and ends with the western Wuying Ge (Ê≠¶Ëã±ÈòÅ) and all the street is covered with slabstones. Most of the houses are old here and one of them is conspicuous with stone lions and flagpoles etc. Local people call it Flagpole (ÊóóÊùÜÈô¢) and the ancestor is the Xianfeng Emperor's imperial guards and all the things are given by the emperor.  Legend  There are two legends about the background of Niangziguan. The first is that Envy girls Temple(Â¶íÂ•≥Á•†) is built here to commemorate Jiezitui's (‰ªãÂ≠êÊé®) sister. The other is that Li Shimin's sister-the Princess Pingyang once led niangzijun to guard the pass, so later generations called it Niangziguan. The latter is accepted by most people and now it has become a conclusion. The vicinity of niangziguan now also remains some legends and cites about Princess Ping Yang.http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/49146738.html?fr=qrl&cid;=976&index;=2&fr2;=query  Customs  Levigation Because the village is located alongside the bank of Mianshui River, the levigation is flourished there. The function of the levigation is to make fragrant but it does great harm to the environment so the levigation is banned by the government. It will disappear in the history. Niangziguan is the key point to Shanxi so there is a special custom called Horse Race (Ë∑ëÈ©¨). On 16 January every year, local people take their horses, asses and mules to gather in Dongzhai Village (Ëë£ÂØ®Êùë) to circle in a 400-meter- long alley. There is no saddle on the horse and the man who rides the horse raises his hands over his head with his legs clamp the horse. People put a lot of ashes on the street to avoid slipping as well as make the atmosphere active. The aim of the activity is to avoid disease and disaster as well as best wishes for the future.http://dcbbs.zol.com.cn/57/17_566198.html###  Gallery  File:ÂÆøÂ∞ÜÊ•ºÊ™êÂªä.jpg File:Gravel roadÔºàÂçµÁü≥Ë∑ØÔºâ.jpg File:WaterfallÔºàÁÄëÂ∏ÉÔºâ.jpg File:The Great Wall and Guanmen Lou(ÈïøÂüéÂèäÂÖ≥Èó®Ê•º).jpg  References  Category:Township-level divisions of Shanxi Category:Yangquan ","title":"Niangziguan Town"},{"id":"34024476","title":"1902 Greek legislative election"},{"id":"34024494","title":"1905 Greek legislative election"},{"id":"34024499","text":"The Kaso River (Sungai Kaso or Kacu) is a stream in the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, about 1100 km northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.Sungai Kaso at Geonames.org (cc-by); Last updated 2013-06-04; Database dump downloaded 2015-11-27 One of its tributaries is the Seputan River.

Monuments of the Leyla-Tepe were first located in the 1980s by I. G. Narimanov, a Soviet archaeologist. Recent attention to the monuments has been inspired by the risk of their damage due to the construction of the Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus pipeline.

Problems of Early Metal Age Archaeology of Caucasus and Anatolia. Proceedings of International Conference. Tbilisi, 2014 Recent research indicates the connections rather to the pre-Uruk traditions, such as the late Ubaid period, and Ubaid-Uruk phases.

( means \\"uncompounded\\".)Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996). . Aristoxenus (fl. 335 BCE) defines melodically incomposite intervals in the following context: In another place, Aristoxenus clarifies that It is thus not an issue of the voice being physically incapable of singing a note within an incomposite interval. For example, in the enharmonic genus the distance from the neighbouring scale degrees lichanos () to mesƒì () is a ditone‚Äîa gap equivalent to the major-third interval between F and A in the modern scale. In such a case the function of the note ŒªŒπœáŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ is such that \\"the 'nature of ŒºŒµŒª·ø≥Œ¥ŒØŒ±' somehow requires that it should leap forward at least as far as ŒºŒ≠œÉŒ∑, without touching down anywhere in between.

In other words, \\"being composite\\" and \\"being incomposite\\" are attributes of the dynamic character of melodic motion. \\"None of these consists in the voice's coming to rest at points separated by distances of specific and determinate sizes\\".Andrew Barker, \\"The Journeying Voice: Melody and Metaphysics in Aristoxenian Science\\", Apeiron: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy and Science 38, no. 3 (September 2005): 161‚Äì84.

An incomposite interval is \\"bounded by successive notes\\" in a scale: \\"If the bounding notes are successive, no note has been left out; if none has been left out, none will intervene; if none intervenes, none will divide the interval; and what does not admit of division will not be composite\\".Aristoxenus, Harmonic Introduction III:2, translated in Andrew Barker, Greek Musical Writings: Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge Readings in the Literature of Music 2 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989): 172. . Gaudentius (before the 6th century CE) explains incomposite intervals as scale-building elements: Aristides Quintilianus (writing probably in the 3rd century AD) enumerates the incomposite intervals: \\"the smallest, so far as their use in melody is concerned, is the enharmonic diesis, followed‚Äîto speak rather roughly‚Äîby the semitone, which is twice the diesis, the tone, which is twice the semitone, and finally the ditone, which is twice the tone\\".Aristides Quintilianus, De musica, translation from Andrew Barker, Greek Musical Writings: Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge Readings in the Literature of Music 2 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989): 410. . These various sizes of incomposite interval depend on the genus of the tetrachord, as explained by Nicomachus in the first century AD: Thus whether an interval is composite or incomposite is a matter of context (that is, the genus in effect at that point in the melody). A semitone is an incomposite interval in the diatonic or chromatic genera, but not because quarter tone intervals may be difficult to sing in tune. It is a composite interval in the enharmonic genus, where the semitone occurs only as the outer interval of the pyknon, made of two quarter tones. Following the strict definition found in Nicola Vicentino's L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica (1555), all intervals larger than the major third (or ditone) are necessarily composite. However, for the purpose of his discussion of the \\"modern practice\\" of the 16th century, he extended the definition to include larger intervals within the octave. Accordingly, a perfect fourth is \\"composite\\" if it is filled in stepwise in a composition (C-D-E-F), but is \\"incomposite\\" when it occurs as a melodic leap or harmonic interval, without any intermediary tones.Henry W. Kaufmann, \\"Vicentino and the Greek Genera\\", Journal of the American Musicological Society 16, no. 3 (Autumn 1963): 325‚Äì46. Citation on 331. A harmonic minor scale.

Its creation mirrored the reform of the courts of England and Wales five years earlier under the Judicature Acts. The Act created a Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal.  Establishment  The High Court was created by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act 1877, through the amalgamation of a number of courts. Most importantly, the three superior common-law courts (the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of Exchequer) and the Court of Chancery were merged into the new court. Also merged into it were the courts of Landed Estates, Probate, Matrimonial Causes, Admiralty, and Bankruptcy.Delaney, V.T.H. Christopher Palles Alan Figgis and Co. 1960, p. 94 However, the right of appeal from Ireland to the House of Lords in England was preserved. An important consequence of the amalgamation of the superior common-law courts with the court of equity (Chancery) was that, for the first time, the previously separate systems of common law and equity were merged. The structure of the abolished courts was reflected in the divisions created for the new High Court. These proved to be unnecessarily complex, and the opportunity presented by the death, retirement, and transfer of a number of the judges was taken in order to simplify the organisation of the divisions, so that by 1897 there were only two: Chancery, and the Queen's Bench.Delaney, p. 94 Of the existing office holders, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland presided in the new Court of Appeal. The Master of the Rolls in Ireland and the Vice-Chancellor moved to the Chancery Division; the latter office was abolished in 1904. The Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas retained his rank until 1887 when the incumbent became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Christopher Palles, the last Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer remained in office until 1916, acting as a judge both of the King's Bench Division and of the Court of Appeal.Delaney p. 95  Partition  The Government of Ireland Act 1920 abolished the Supreme Court of Judicature created by the 1877 Act.Government of Ireland Act 1920 s.38 It split the High Court into separate courts for Northern and Southern Ireland; judges of the former court became judges in Southern Ireland unless they chose otherwise. The Court of Appeal was also split into separate courts with a new overarching High Court of Appeal for Ireland; the latter court sat a few times but was abolished in 1922 in consequence of the establishment of the Irish Free State.Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 Subsequent developments Following the establishment of the Irish Free State in December 1922, the High Court of Justice in Southern Ireland (now the High Court of the Irish Free State) remained in existence for two years, in accordance with the \\"carry-over\\" provisions in Article 75 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. It was abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924, which replaced it with a new High Court. With only two exceptions, the judges of the old High Court were retired on a generous pension.Hogan, G.W.

The ship was launched in 1930 by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. at Nagasaki, on the southern island of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, entering service in 1930. The ship was named for the Yasukuni Shrine, a famous Shinto shrine dedicated to the war dead of Japan, located in Tokyo.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1935). The Nomenclature of the N.Y.K. Fleet, p. 50. Background The Yasukuni Maru and her sister ship Terukuni Maru were built for NYK‚Äôs fortnightly scheduled high- speed European service, coming into operation from the autumn of 1930. Both ships were specially designed for tropical conditions, with state-of-the-art air conditioning and fresh air circulation systems, as their routing was south from Japan, through the Indian Ocean, Suez Canal and Mediterranean Sea.Arthur de Carle Sowerby, John Calvin Ferguson, China Society of Arts and Science The China journal, Volume 13. Page 136 Both ships were initially designed for use with geared turbine engines for projected cruising speed of 18 knots. However, under increasing pressure from the Japanese government to use only equipment and technologies available domestically, the design was changed to use standard Mitsubishi-Sulzer marine diesel engines, which reduced cruising speed to 15 knots.Yasukuni Maru 1930-1944 The 11,933-ton steel-hulled vessel had a length of , and a beam of , with a single funnel, two masts, and double screws. Yasukuni Maru provided accommodation for 121 first-class passengers and 68 second class passengers. There was also room for up to 60 third-class passengers. The ship and passengers were served by a crew of 177.Kawata, T.Glimpses of East Asia (1936) Nihon Y≈´sen Kabushiki Kaisha, page 20 Civilian career Yasukuni Maru departed Yokohama on her maiden voyage on 22 September 1930 for London, with ports of call in between at Yokkaichi, Osaka, Kobe, Moji, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Colombo, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Marseilles, and Gibraltar. On her return to Yokohama, she substituted Naples for Marseilles and arrived back at Yokohama on 18 October 1930. Thereafter, she entered regular service with NYK, following the same routing. Yasukuni Maru - NYK postcard, 1930s. On 23 June 1933, Yasukuni Maru rescued five crewmen from a sinking Chinese junk near Hong Kong. On 5 April 1934, Yasukuni Maru responded to a distress call from the Imperial Japanese Navy training cruiser at Port Said, Egypt, and took off several ill sailors including an appendicitis patient. On 12 March 1935, when Yasukuni Maru docked at London, it was reported that a 75 lb silver ingot had been stolen from her treasury. Yasukuni Maru carried the Japanese Olympic team back from Germany after the 1936 Berlin Olympics. On 16 November 1937, Yasukuni Maru became the first ship on the Europe-Japan route to be equipped with a two-way ship-to- shore wireless telephone for passengers to make telephone calls. On 2 October 1938, Yasukuni Maru transported an art mission consisting of 30 Takarasiennes from the Takarazuka Revue, together with 18 managers, orchestra members and support staff from Kobe to Naples for an art mission to Germany and Italy commemorating the first anniversary of the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact.National Diet Library newsletter, No.205, April 2016 In September ‚Äì October 1939, at the request of the Foreign Ministry, Yasukuni Maru evacuated 240 Japanese civilians, members of the diplomatic staff and some German nationals from Germany on the verge of World War II. She returned to Yokohama on 18 October and was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy on 25 October to 11 December for use as an auxiliary transport, and was briefly used to transport troops and war materials from Japan to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, as the war situation stabilized, she was returned to NYK. With the situation in Europe regarded as unsafe following the sinking of Terukuni Maru off the coast of Great Britain by a naval mine, Yasukuni Maru was rescheduled for use on NYK‚Äôs route from Kobe to South America via Honolulu, Hilo, San Francisco and Los Angeles. On 8 August 1940 Yasukuni Maru embarked 30 German pilots previously employed in Colombia for return to Germany. Military career Yasukuni Maru in the background and the battleship at sea, 1941. On 29 October 1940, Yasukuni Maru was again requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was classified this time as an auxiliary submarine tender. She was taken to Kure Naval Arsenal, where her luxurious internal fittings were torn out, and she was repainted gunmetal grey. On 11 January 1941 she was assigned to the 1st Submarine Division of the IJN 6th Fleet. During the conversion, she was armed with six obsolete 152-mm/50 cal. (6-inch) guns in single mounts and two dual mount Type 93 13.2-mm machine guns and fitted with one 1110-mm and one 900-mm searchlight. During most of the remainder of 1941, Yasukuni Maru was based at Takao in Taiwan for patrols of Ryukyu Islands and the coast of China. However, at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, she was based at Kwajalein. On 20 December 1941, she was assigned to the 3rd Submarine Division, still with the IJN 6th Fleet. Kwajalein was attacked on 1 February 1942 by aircraft from United States Navy Task Force 8 (), with Yasukuni Maru hit by one bomb in her aft turret and damage to her stern. She returned to Kure on 1 March for repairs lasting to 23 April. She returned to Kure again on 23 November for repairs and regular maintenance. In early 1943, Yasukuni Maru was assigned to ‚ÄúOperation C‚Äù, the reinforcement of the Japanese landing on New Guinea. Yasukuni Maru, with 1448 men and 11 tanks of the IJA 20th Infantry Division departed Pusan for Wewak on 8 January 1943 together with transports Hakozaki Maru and Aratama Maru and the destroyer . The convoy successfully delivers to reinforcements to Rabaul and Wewak. On 4 February 1943, Yasukuni Maru took on troops and supplies of the IJA 41st Infantry Division at Tsingtao, China, disembarking the troops at Wewak at the end of the month, and returning to Kure in early March. She was based at Truk in April, and was part of another troop convoy to Balikpapan in May. In October, she was part of the convoyed evacuating surviving Japanese troops from Wewak to Palau, and returned to Japan at the end of December 1943. On 24 January 1944, Yasukuni Maru was assigned to a troop convoy departing Tateyama, Chiba for Truk. On 31 January, approximately northwest of Truk, the convoy was attacked by the US submarine and Yasukuni Maru was hit by two torpedoes. She took on water rapidly, and sank within five minutes at with loss of 300 crewmen and 888 technicians. Escorting destroyer recovered only 43 survivors.

A p‚Äìn diode is a type of semiconductor diode based upon the p‚Äìn junction. The diode conducts current in only one direction, and it is made by joining a p-type semiconducting layer to an n-type semiconducting layer. Semiconductor diodes have multiple uses including rectification of alternating current to direct current, detection of radio signals, emitting light and detecting light. Structure The figure shows two of the many possible structures used for p‚Äìn semiconductor diodes, both adapted to increase the voltage the devices can withstand in reverse bias. The top structure uses a mesa to avoid a sharp curvature of the p+-region next to the adjoining n-layer. The bottom structure uses a lightly doped p-guard-ring at the edge of the sharp corner of the p+-layer to spread the voltage out over a larger distance and reduce the electric field. (Superscripts like n+ or n‚àí refer to heavier or lighter impurity doping levels.) Mesa diode structure (top) and planar diode structure with guard-ring (bottom). Electrical behavior Nonideal p‚Äìn diode current-voltage characteristics. The ideal diode has zero resistance for the forward bias polarity, and infinite resistance (conducts zero current) for the reverse voltage polarity; if connected in an alternating current circuit, the semiconductor diode acts as an electrical rectifier. The semiconductor diode is not ideal. As shown in the figure, the diode does not conduct appreciably until a nonzero knee voltage (also called the turn-on voltage or the cut-in voltage) is reached. Above this voltage the slope of the current-voltage curve is not infinite (on-resistance is not zero). In the reverse direction the diode conducts a nonzero leakage current (exaggerated by a smaller scale in the figure) and at a sufficiently large reverse voltage below the breakdown voltage the current increases very rapidly with more negative reverse voltages. As shown in the figure, the on and off resistances are the reciprocal slopes of the current-voltage characteristic at a selected bias point: : r_D = \\\\left . \\\\frac {\\\\Delta v_D}{\\\\Delta i_D} \\\\right _{v_D=V_{BIAS}} \\\\ , where rD is the resistance and ŒîiD is the current change corresponding to the diode voltage change ŒîvD at the bias Operation An abrupt p‚Äìn diode made by doping silicon. Here, the operation of the abrupt p‚Äìn diode is considered. By \\"abrupt\\" is meant that the p- and n-type doping exhibit a step function discontinuity at the plane where they encounter each other. The objective is to explain the various bias regimes in the figure displaying current-voltage characteristics. Operation is described using band-bending diagrams that show how the lowest conduction band energy and the highest valence band energy vary with position inside the diode under various bias conditions. For additional discussion, see the articles Semiconductor and Band diagram. Zero bias Band-bending diagram for p‚Äìn diode at zero applied voltage. The depletion region is shaded. The figure shows a band bending diagram for a p‚Äìn diode; that is, the band edges for the conduction band (upper line) and the valence band (lower line) are shown as a function of position on both sides of the junction between the p-type material (left side) and the n-type material (right side). When a p-type and an n-type region of the same semiconductor are brought together and the two diode contacts are short-circuited, the Fermi half-occupancy level (dashed horizontal straight line) is situated at a constant level. This level ensures that in the field- free bulk on both sides of the junction the hole and electron occupancies are correct. (So, for example, it is not necessary for an electron to leave the n-side and travel to the p-side through the short circuit to adjust the occupancies.) However, a flat Fermi level requires the bands on the p-type side to move higher than the corresponding bands on the n-type side, forming a step or barrier in the band edges, labeled œÜB. This step forces the electron density on the p-side to be a Boltzmann factor exp(‚àíœÜB/Vth) smaller than on the n-side, corresponding to the lower electron density in p-region. The symbol Vth denotes the thermal voltage, defined as Vth = kBT/q. At T = 290 kelvins (room temperature), the thermal voltage is approximately 25 mV. Similarly, hole density on the n-side is a Boltzmann factor smaller than on the p-side. This reciprocal reduction in minority carrier density across the junction forces the pn-product of carrier densities to be :pn=p_B n_B\\\\, e^{-\\\\varphi_\\\\mathrm{B}/V_\\\\mathrm{th}} at any position within the diode at equilibrium. Where pB and nB are the bulk majority carrier densities on the p-side and the n-side, respectively. As a result of this step in band edges, a depletion region near the junction becomes depleted of both holes and electrons, forming an insulating region with almost no mobile charges. There are, however, fixed, immobile charges due to dopant ions. The near absence of mobile charge in the depletion layer means that the mobile charges present are insufficient to balance the immobile charge contributed by the dopant ions: a negative charge on the p-type side due to acceptor dopant and as a positive charge on the n-type side due to donor dopant. Because of this charge there is an electric field in this region, as determined by Poisson's equation. The width of the depletion region adjusts so the negative acceptor charge on the p-side exactly balances the positive donor charge on the n-side, so there is no electric field outside the depletion region on either side. In this band configuration no voltage is applied and no current flows through the diode. To force current through the diode a forward bias must be applied, as described next. Forward bias Band-bending diagram for p‚Äìn diode in forward bias. Diffusion drives carriers across the junction. Quasi-Fermi levels and carrier densities in forward biased p‚Äìn- diode. The figure assumes recombination is confined to the regions where majority carrier concentration is near the bulk values, which is not accurate when recombination-generation centers in the field region play a role. In forward bias, the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the p-type material and the negative terminal is connected to the n-type material so that holes are injected into the p-type material and electrons into the n-type material. The electrons in the n-type material are called majority carriers on that side, but electrons that make it to the p-type side are called minority carriers. The same descriptors apply to holes: they are majority carriers on the p-type side, and minority carriers on the n-type side. A forward bias separates the two bulk half-occupancy levels by the amount of the applied voltage, which lowers the separation of the p-type bulk band edges to be closer in energy to those of the n-type. As shown in the diagram, the step in band edges is reduced by the applied voltage to œÜB‚àívD. (The band bending diagram is made in units of volts, so no electron charge appears to convert vD to energy.) Under forward bias, a diffusion current flows (that is a current driven by a concentration gradient) of holes from the p-side into the n-side, and of electrons in the opposite direction from the n-side to the p-side. The gradient driving this transfer is set up as follows: in the bulk distant from the interface, minority carriers have a very low concentration compared to majority carriers, for example, electron density on the p-side (where they are minority carriers) is a factor lower than on the n-side (where they are majority carriers). On the other hand, near the interface, application of voltage vD reduces the step in band edges and increases minority carrier densities by a Boltzmann factor exp(vD/Vth) above the bulk values. Within the junction, the pn-product is increased above the equilibrium value to: :pn=\\\\left(p_B n_B \\\\ e^{-\\\\varphi_B/V_{th}}\\\\right)\\\\ e^{v_D/V_{th}} \\\\ . The gradient driving the diffusion is then the difference between the large excess minority carrier densities at the barrier and the low densities in the bulk, and that gradient drives diffusion of minority carriers from the interface into the bulk. The injected minority carriers are reduced in number as they travel into the bulk by recombination mechanisms that drive the excess concentrations toward the bulk values. Recombination can occur by direct encounter with a majority carrier, annihilating both carriers, or through a recombination-generation center, a defect that alternately traps holes and electrons, assisting recombination. The minority carriers have a limited lifetime, and this lifetime in turn limits how far they can diffuse from the majority carrier side into the minority carrier side, the so-called diffusion length. In the LED recombination of electrons and holes is accompanied by emission of light of a wavelength related to the energy gap between valence and conduction bands, so the diode converts a portion of the forward current into light. Under forward bias, the half-occupancy lines for holes and electrons cannot remain flat throughout the device as they are when in equilibrium, but become quasi-Fermi levels that vary with position. As shown in the figure, the electron quasi-Fermi level shifts with position, from the half-occupancy equilibrium Fermi level in the n-bulk, to the half- occupancy equilibrium level for holes deep in the p-bulk. The hole quasi-Fermi level does the reverse. The two quasi-Fermi levels do not coincide except deep in the bulk materials. The figure shows the majority carrier densities drop from the majority carrier density levels nB, pB in their respective bulk materials, to a level a factor exp(‚àí(œÜB‚àívD)/Vth) smaller at the top of the barrier, which is reduced from the equilibrium value œÜB by the amount of the forward diode bias vD. Because this barrier is located in the oppositely doped material, the injected carriers at the barrier position are now minority carriers. As recombination takes hold, the minority carrier densities drop with depth to their equilibrium values for bulk minority carriers, a factor exp(‚àíœÜB/Vth) smaller than their bulk densities nB, pB as majority carriers before injection. At this point the quasi-Fermi levels rejoin the bulk Fermi level positions. The reduced step in band edges also means that under forward bias the depletion region narrows as holes are pushed into it from the p-side and electrons from the n-side. In the simple p‚Äìn diode the forward current increases exponentially with forward bias voltage due to the exponential increase in carrier densities, so there is always some current at even very small values of applied voltage. However, if one is interested in some particular current level, it will require a \\"knee\\" voltage before that current level is reached. For example, a very common choice in texts about circuits using silicon diodes is VKnee = 0.7 V. Above the knee, the current continues to increase exponentially. Some special diodes, such as some varactors, are designed deliberately to maintain a low current level up to some knee voltage in the forward direction. Reverse bias Band-bending for p‚Äìn diode in reverse bias Quasi-Fermi levels in reverse-biased p‚Äìn diode. In reverse bias the occupancy level for holes again tends to stay at the level of the bulk p-type semiconductor while the occupancy level for electrons follows that for the bulk n-type. In this case, the p-type bulk band edges are raised relative to the n-type bulk by the reverse bias vR, so the two bulk occupancy levels are separated again by an energy determined by the applied voltage. As shown in the diagram, this behavior means the step in band edges is increased to , and the depletion region widens as holes are pulled away from it on the p-side and electrons on the n-side. When the reverse bias is applied, the electric field in the depletion region is increased, pulling the electrons and holes further apart than in the zero bias case. Thus, any current that flows is due to the very weak process of carrier generation inside the depletion region due to generation-recombination defects in this region. That very small current is the source of the leakage current under reverse bias. In the photodiode, reverse current is introduced using creation of holes and electrons in the depletion region by incident light, thus converting a portion of the incident light into an electric current. When the reverse bias becomes very large, reaching the breakdown voltage, the generation process in the depletion region accelerates leading to an avalanche condition which can cause runaway and destroy the diode. Diode law The DC current-voltage behavior of the ideal p‚Äìn diode is governed by the Shockley diode equation: :i_\\\\mathrm{D} = I_\\\\mathrm{R} \\\\left(e^{v_\\\\mathrm{D}/V_\\\\mathrm{th}}-1\\\\right), where vD is the DC voltage across the diode and IR is the reverse saturation current, the current that flows when the diode is reverse biased (that is, vD is large and negative). The quantity Vth is the thermal voltage defined as Vth = kBT/q. This is approximately equal to 25 mV at T = 290 kelvins. This equation does not model the non-ideal behavior such as excess reverse leakage or breakdown phenomena. In many practical diodes this equation must be modified to read :i_D=I_R \\\\left(e^{v_\\\\mathrm{D}/(n V_\\\\mathrm{th})}-1\\\\right), where n is an ideality factor introduced to model a slower rate of increase than predicted by the ideal diode law. Using this equation, the diode on-resistance is :r_\\\\mathrm{D} = \\\\frac{1}{di_\\\\mathrm{D}/dv_\\\\mathrm{D}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{nV_\\\\mathrm{th}}{i_\\\\mathrm{D}} , exhibiting a lower resistance the higher the current. Capacitance The depletion layer between the n- and p-sides of a p‚Äìn-diode serves as an insulating region that separates the two diode contacts. Thus, the diode in reverse bias exhibits a depletion-layer capacitance, sometimes more vaguely called a junction capacitance, analogous to a parallel plate capacitor with a dielectric spacer between the contacts. In reverse bias the width of the depletion layer is widened with increasing reverse bias vR, and the capacitance is accordingly decreased. Thus, the junction serves as a voltage-controllable capacitor. In a simplified one- dimensional model, the junction capacitance is: :C_J = \\\\kappa \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{A}{w(v_R)} \\\\ , with A the device area, Œ∫ the relative semiconductor dielectric permittivity, Œµ0 the electric constant, and w the depletion width (thickness of the region where mobile carrier density is negligible). In forward bias, besides the above depletion-layer capacitance, minority carrier charge injection and diffusion occurs. A diffusion capacitance exists expressing the change in minority carrier charge that occurs with a change in forward bias. In terms of the stored minority carrier charge, the diode current iD is: :i_D = \\\\frac{Q_D}{\\\\tau_T} \\\\ , where QD is the charge associated with diffusion of minority carriers, and œÑT is the transit time, the time taken for the minority charge to transit the injection region. Typical values for transit time are 0.1‚Äì100 ns. On this basis, the diffusion capacitance is calculated to be: :C_D = \\\\frac {dQ_D}{dv_D} = \\\\tau_T \\\\frac {d i_D}{dv_D} = \\\\frac{i_D \\\\tau_T}{V_{th}} \\\\ . Generally speaking, for usual current levels in forward bias, this capacitance far exceeds the depletion- layer capacitance. Transient response Norton source. The diode is a highly non-linear device, but for small-signal variations its response can be analyzed using a small-signal circuit based upon the DC bias about which the signal is imagined to vary. The equivalent circuit is shown at the right for a diode driven by a Norton source. Using Kirchhoff's current law at the output node: :I_S=\\\\left(j\\\\omega (C_J+C_D) + \\\\frac{1}{r_D} +\\\\frac{1}{R_S} \\\\right) V_O \\\\ , with CD the diode diffusion capacitance, CJ the diode junction capacitance (the depletion layer capacitance) and rD the diode resistance, all at the selected quiescent bias point or Q-point. The output voltage provided by this circuit is then: :\\\\frac{V_O}{I_S} =\\\\frac{(R_S \\\\mathit{\\\\parallel} r_D)}{1+j\\\\omega (C_D+C_J)(R_S \\\\mathit{\\\\parallel}r_D)} \\\\ , with (RSrD) the parallel combination of RS and rD. This transresistance amplifier exhibits a corner frequency, denoted fC: :f_C = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi (C_D+C_J)(R_S \\\\mathit{\\\\parallel}r_D)} \\\\ , and for frequencies f >> fC the gain rolls off with frequency as the capacitors short-circuit the resistor rD. Assuming, as is the case when the diode is turned on, that CD>>CJ and RS>>rD, the expressions found above for the diode resistance and capacitance provide: :f_C = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi n\\\\tau_T} \\\\ , which relates the corner frequency to the diode transit time œÑT. For diodes operated in reverse bias, CD is zero and the term corner frequency often is replaced by cutoff frequency. In any event, in reverse bias the diode resistance becomes quite large, although not infinite as the ideal diode law suggests, and the assumption that it is less than the Norton resistance of the driver may not be accurate. The junction capacitance is small and depends upon the reverse bias vR. The cutoff frequency is then: :f_C = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi C_J(R_S \\\\mathit{\\\\parallel}r_D)} \\\\ , and varies with reverse bias because the width w(vR) of the insulating region depleted of mobile carriers increases with increasing diode reverse bias, reducing the capacitance.

Background Garrard, christened Hector Lewis Garrard, was the son of a prominent family in Cincinnati, Ohio On 1 Sept 1846, Garrard, 17 years old, joined a caravan in Westport Landing, Missouri to travel along the Santa Fe Trail to New Mexico. He stopped off at Bent's Fort for two months and continued on to Taos with a company of Mountain Men to avenge the death of Charles Bent in the Taos Revolt. While in Taos, Garrard attended the trial of some of the Mexicans and Pueblos who had revolted against U.S. rule of New Mexico, newly captured in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Garrard wrote the only eye witness account of the trial and hanging of six convicted men. Wah-to-Yah is the only well-known book written by Garrard. It has won a secure place in the literature of the American West. Garrard returned home after his 10-month trip and apparently never visited the West again. Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail The full title of Garrard's book is Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail: or Prairie and Scalp Dances, with a Look at Los Rancheros from Muleback and the Rocky Mountain Campfire. The book is \\"fresh and vigorous\\" and contains in its pages authentic descriptions of \\"the Indian, the trader, the mountain man, their dress, and behavior and speech and the country and climate they lived in.\\" The pages of the book contain a wealth of characters, including Kit Carson, Jim Beckwourth, Ceran St. Vrain, George F. Ruxton, William Bent, and others. The book contains an \\"anthropologically accurate\\" description of the Cheyenne Indians. Garrard condemns the U.S. war against Mexico and hanging of the rebels in Taos as unjust. Wah-to-Yah, the title, is the Indian name for the Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado. The book is often compared with Francis Parkman's, The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life.

CIMAvax-EGF is composed of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) conjugated to a protein carrier. The vaccine was developed by the Center of Molecular Immunology, Havana, Cuba There are agreements in place to test it in the United States, Japan, and some European countries. It is currently available in Cuba, Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Peru and Paraguay. In October 2015 Serbia's Institute of Virology, Vaccines and Sera (AKA Torlak Institute) signed a memorandum for use in 30 patients as part of a study. CimaVax is relatively cheap to produce and store, and has low toxicity. Side effects of the vaccine appear to be mild, and include chills, fever, and feeling sick.  Mechanism  CimaVax is an active vaccine with which patients are immunized with epidermal growth factor (EGF), thus raising antibodies targeting EGF itself. The product is also formulated with the Neisseria meningitidis outer protein P64k and Montanide ISA 51 as adjuvants to potentiate the immune response. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is hijacked by many types of cancer, including cancers of the lung, colon, kidney, and head and neck. By raising antibodies against EGF, which is EGFR's major ligand, the concentrations of EGF in the blood are reduced. Thus CimaVax does not target the cancer cells directly, but is expected to work against these cancers by denying the cancers the growth stimulus they require. For this reason, the Roswell Park Cancer Institute group thinks that it may prove most useful as a preventive vaccine rather than as a cancer therapy per se. Research  Cuba Early trials showed a trend towards improved survival among vaccinated test subjects. A direct correlation between the level of antibodies that a vaccinated patient raises against EGF and survival has been observed in several trials, and in one of the largest trials there was also an age-dependence, with only subjects under the age of 60 benefiting in terms of survival. More antibodies are raised when the vaccine is formulated with Montanide ISA 51 rather than aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, and when patients receive a low dose of cyclophosphamide three days before vaccine administration. Cyclophosphamide is thought to temporarily block the body's natural immune tolerance to EGF, thereby increasing antibody titers. Researchers caution that the early results to date have been in relatively small, early-stage trials with patients that were carefully selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and given specialized oncology care; they may therefore not be representative of most patients who might benefit from the vaccine. It has been urged that CimaVax be tested in patients with earlier-stage NSCLC cancer and in patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy, and that research be conducted to determine which subgroups of NSCLC patients do and don't respond to the vaccine. It has been suggested that CimaVax may also be effective in other types of cancer that are dependent on EGF/EGFR, including many cases of prostate cancer. International  Trials are being organized in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Serbia. In late October 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration authorized the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to conduct a PhaseI/II clinical trial of CimaVAX in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. By the middle of the following month, nearly 200 people had volunteered to be subjects in the trial. In September 2018, Principal Investigator Grace Dy shared the initial results of the first Roswell Park trial. They found that the combination of CIMAvax with the PD-1 inhibitor checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was safe and well tolerated in 13 people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when administered at the doses normally recommended for each agent individually. Notably, they observed durable responses to the combination treatment in patients who were unlikely to benefit from nivolumab alone due to low tumor levels of PD-L1, suggesting that the combination may work better than either agent individually. The final results of this early trial were released in March 2019. The results were in line with the September 2018 report, with the additional finding that patients receiving combination therapy in this trial were more likely to develop robust early antibody responses to CIMAvax as compared with what had been observed in earlier studies with CIMAvax alone. An ongoing Phase II clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02955290) has been expanded to include patients with advanced, recurrent head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma, as well as patients with advanced NSCLC but with high PD-L1 levels, who will be treated with pembrolizumab in combination with CIMAvax instead of nivolumab.

Daugherty Company Building, is a former store located in Clinton, Tennessee. It sold furniture, appliances, hardware, flooring, and other household items, until its closure in 1985. The building was designed by architect Clem H. Meyers, and was constructed between the years 1938 and 1942. In 2010, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The furniture store was originally located in Fork Mountain, Tennessee, but was moved to Clinton in the late 1930s because of the population growth of Anderson County. More than 75,000 individuals had moved to the area in a two-year period, and the demand for household items was high. Daugherty Furniture Store served as the only \\"one-stop shop\\" for Anderson County residents. The store offered home delivery, with a fleet of delivery trucks. The third and fourth floors of the building served as apartments, which housed Oak Ridge workers and scientists in need of housing in a region running out of housing options. The business expanded into the nearby regions, and the main location served as a meeting place for local businessmen. The attention and popularity of the main location helped to develop the neighborhood of Market and Main Streets in Clinton. The store was owned and operated by the family, and most of the employees were family members. Daugherty's brothers, Leonard, Emmitt, and Laford, worked for the shop, with Leonard serving as a manager overseeing deliveries and purchases. Their sons, along with Daugherty's sons, all worked at the store and remained working there until its closing in 1985. All employees were trained to be familiar with the store's merchandise, including demonstrating Singer sewing machines. Employees also provided repair services, both in-store and in the homes of customers. Many employees lived in the upstairs apartments, and Daugherty lived in the corner unit and oversaw the company until his death in 1985. Architecture The original building was located in Fork Mountain, Tennessee, and was a simple one-story building. When Daugherty moved to Clinton in 1935, he rented two buildings across the street from where the current building stands. While planning to build a new location, he found inspiration in a building in Oak Ridge owned by Elza Gate. Gate's home, known as the Glenn Copeland House, was entirely faced in stone (except the roof). Daugherty would use Frank Gilbreath as an advisor on building his store; Gilbreath served as stonemason on the Glenn Copeland House. When Daugherty began exploring options for building his store, his friends and colleagues advised him to avoid building a multi-story building. He hired architect Clem H. Meyer, who had designed Huntsville High School in Scott County, Tennessee. Oba Hill was also hired, who worked alongside Gilbreath on the stone work. About 99,000 pounds of locally quarried stone was used on the buildings exterior, most which came from areas near the New River region of Morgan County and Scruggs Farm in Bethel. All of the stone was hand-chiseled and laid by Gilbreath and Sebastian Marie, another local stone cutter. When the building was complete, in 1942, it was the largest commercial building in Clinton, along with Magnet Mills, Inc. The Daugherty Furniture Building doesn't touch on traditional architectural styles, but serves as an example of vernacular architecture, by using local construction methods and materials. The buildings interior, from the fourth floor to the basement, looks like an inverted step pyramid. The load bearing walls are stair-stepped, therefore the fifth floor walls are thinner than those in the basement; the basement walls are 26 inches thick, with the fifth floor being 12 inches. The architecture of the building was also influenced by Meyer's work on Huntsville High School, using techniques found in that project. Examples include the rectangular shape, stone exterior, and rectangular steel windows. The design is also minimalistic, reflecting the wartime emphasis on simplicity seen in design during the period.

However, the armies of the new khan of the Golden Horde Toqta entered Bulgaria in pursuit of his enemy Chaka, and Theodore Svetoslav promptly organized a plot, deposing Chaka and having him strangled in prison in 1300. Theodore Svetoslav now became emperor of Bulgaria and sent Chaka's severed head as a present to Toqta, who withdrew his armies from the country.

In addition, Orff learned about architecture school and enrolled in Reuben Rainey's class who is a well-known teacher of landscape architecture history at the school. During his class, Orff realized that landscape architecture was a combination of many things that she was passionate about; it integrated her interests in science and politics as well as her talent in art and design.Admin.

Retrieved May 1, 2020 Before returning to school in a Master in Landscape Architecture program from the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University, Orff Off traveled to Chile and worked on a women's health magazine.  Design philosophy  Orff's passion for the role that landscape architecture takes in cities has led her to the belief that landscape architects must do more than \\"beautify\\"; instead, they must assist in resetting the ecosystems to reconnect people to each other through social spaces that also implement ecological services.Kate Orff. MacArthur Foundation. Retrieved April 29, 2020 She states that, since the formation of the discipline, landscape architects had been working closely with the carbon- centric world; people have been creating wonderful gardens as a focus for the field but has been letting the Earth decay in the back-drop.Roth, K. (2020, February 19). Landscape architects shift emphasis to the ecosystem. AP News. Retrieved April 29, 2020 To redirect the attention to the planet's ecological systems as well as link them to policy ideas and infrastructure, Orff constructs a framework of engagement for her designs to create a resilient landscape that can handle future threats of the environment in the future sea- level rise and increase wave action. Orff's studio, SCAPE, which she established in 2007, is well known for its ecologically driven projects throughout the world and takes on many projects that emphasize sustainability due to her feelings of responsibility for the environment. In her studio, Orff and her team produce a design that is based on science and research as well as an activist approach.  Career  In 2004, Orff moved to New York and started her practice out of her studio apartment near Union Square. She started taking on employees in 2007 and thus formally established her firm, SCAPE. Orff and her firm, SCAPE, have developed a design called \\"Oyster-lecture,\\" which serves as ecological infrastructure to filter polluted water and mitigate the effects of storm surge and sea-level rise through the construction of oyster reefs. Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Orff and SCAPE were selected to join an interdisciplinary team for Mayor Bloomberg's Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR). SCAPE's role in the harbor-wide study was to integrate natural systems as risk-reduction infrastructure, and layering strategies for enhanced coastal protection and ecosystem health. The project was awarded an ASLA-NY honor award in 2014. In 2014, SCAPE was recognized as the winner of the Rebuild By Design competition in order to preserve communities after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. SCAPE's winning project was a play off of Oyster- tecture called \\"Living Breakwaters\\" and was meant to reduce erosion on the shoreline of Brooklyn, New York. Living Breakwaters serves as an environmentally-friendly, natural oyster reef that should be able to \\"clean up to millions of liters of harbor water each day.\\" Living Breakwaters has won not only the Rebuild by Design competition, but also the Buckminster Fuller Challenge in 2014, the ACEC NY Engineering Excellence Award in 2015, and the National Achievement Award also in 2015. According to the SCAPE website, the project was due for construction in 2019. Orff was one of presenters at the Landscape Architecture Foundation's The New Landscape Declaration: A Summit on Landscape Architecture and the Future held in Philadelphia on June 10‚Äì11, 2016. This summit brought together the leading minds in the field of landscape architecture to create a declaration on how we need to move forward in a challenging future. The subsequent book that followed this summit published an essay by Orff entitled, ‚ÄúUrban Ecology as Activism‚Äù. In 2017, Orff was the recipient of a \\"Genius Grant\\" from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Orff received the grant for her designs in \\"...adaptive and resilient habitats...\\" and for reviving ecological systems. In 2018, Orff was a keynote speaker at United States Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's ninth annual Rhode Island Energy, Environment and Oceans Leaders Day, held at the Rhode Island Convention Center. The event was attended by approximately 200 attendees from federal and state agencies, municipalities, environmental groups, and the energy industry. In 2019, Orff was elevated to the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Council of Fellows ‚Äì one of the highest honors bestowed on landscape architects practicing in the U.S. Also in 2019, Orff was honored as Waterfront Alliance‚Äôs Heros of the Harbor.  Credentials  As a landscape architect, Orff is accredited in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Arkansas. She is also CLARB Certified.  Major works  In 2011, Princeton University published Gateway, Visions for an Urban National Park by Kate Orff. In 2012, the Aperture Foundation published Petrochemical America, a book by Orff which won the National ALSA award in the communications category in 2013. Petrochemical America featured Richard Misrach's photography of the industrialized Mississippi River and visual narratives by Orff and SCAPE. In 2014, Orff was recognized for her work designing the 103rd Street Community Garden, a winning site of Built by Women New York City, a competition launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation during the fall of 2014 to identify outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered and built by women. Orff's Toward an Urban Ecology, which is part monograph, part manual, part manifesto, reconsiders urban landscape design as a form of activism, demonstrating how to move beyond familiar and increasingly outmoded ways of thinking about environmental, urban, and social issues as separate domains; and advocating for the synthesis of practice to create a truly urban ecology. The book has been lauded for its forward-thinking design provocations that catalyze the reader with a way of thinking and acting ecologically across systems. The book was awarded a National ASLA Honor Award in 2017.

It was first described in 1877 by Italian naturalist Odoardo Beccari and contains 25 species, all of which lack chlorophyll and parasitize fungi for nutrition. All 25 species are distributed through New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands and Queensland, Australia. Description In terms of appearance, the species of Corsia are quite uniform except for the flowers.Paul Kores, David A. White, Leonard B. Thien: Chromosomes of Corsia (Corsiaceae), American Journal of Botany, Vol. 65, No. 5 (May - Jun., 1978), Page. 584-585, Chromosome counts are known only from two species: Corsia cornuta and C. clypeata. Both have a diploid number (2n) of 18. Habit Corsia exist largely underground; only the seldom-formed flower stems develop above ground. The fine, thread-like and hairless root system is weakly branched and whitish, spreading widely just beneath the surface. Several hairless, unbranched and upright flowering stems sprout from a rhizome and are visible above ground. They are usually reddish in color and are high. The xylem is woody and not perforated. Leaves Leaf on a flowering stem of Corsia sp. The foliage along the stem is evenly distributed, and consists of three to seven broadly ovate pointed leaves. Those on the rhizomes are less developed than the reddish leaves on the flowering stems. Along the stem the leaves grow alternately, at their bases they sheath the stem almost entirely. Corsia sp. flower  Flowers  The growth of Corsia flowers appears to be triggered by combination of rain and drought, usually by a prolonged rainy season followed by several dry days. The zygomorphic, trimerous, nodding flowers grow singly and are terminal on the stems. The tepals are colored pale red to brownish red, sometimes with a bit of pale yellow and rarely brownish-green. The six tepals are approximately of the same shape and size, with the exception of the uppermost tepal, termed the labellum, which is considerably larger and usually heart-shaped. The tepals of the species of section Sessilis are long and wide. The tepals of the section Unguiculatis are long and wide. The labellum is about long and wide. The labellum encloses the floral bud until its opening, thereby protecting immature floral parts. The labellum is usually simple, but is occasionally bifurcated at the tip of the midrib. The labellum of Corsia is similar in appearance to the labellum of some orchids, but is not homologous to them; in orchids the labellum is formed from an inner tepal (petal), but in Corsiaceae it forms from an outer tepal (sepal). In Corsia, unlike the orchids, all six stamens are fertile. Fruit and seeds Fruits of Corsia ornata Seeds of Corsia ornata After pollination (possibly by flies), the peduncles extend and a long and slender cylindrical yellowish brown capsule fruit forms. The small dust-like seeds are about long, thick and colored pale to dark brown. The seed coat tightly encloses the endosperm and its surface is finely grooved longitudinally.J.H. Kirkbride, Jr., C.R. Gunn, and M.J. Dallwitz: Family Guide for Fruits and Seeds, Vers. 1.0, 2006, Retrieved 26 March 2007, Online version Although the native habitat of Corsia is relatively calm, seed dispersal is presumed to be facilitated by wind (anemochory).C. Neinhuis, P. Ibisch: Corsiaceae, in: K. Kubitzki (Hrsg.): The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants, Vol. 3, Lilianae, p. 200, 1998, Distribution and habitat Species of Corsia are generally found in floodplains and mountain forests at altitudes of above sea level. They grow in humus-rich soils in shaded areas of high humidity among decaying leaves. The center of diversity for the genus is New Guinea. All species are endemic to New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago), the Solomon Islands, and Australia. Ecology Like other members of Corsiaceae, Corsia species lack chlorophyll and are thus incapable of photosynthesis. Instead, they are myco-heterotrophs, relying exclusively on parasitizing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. Myco-heterotrophs were once mistakenly thought to be saprotrophic plants. It is now known that they do not obtain nourishment directly from decaying organic matter, instead they digest the hyphae of saprotrophic fungi with enzymes and absorb the resulting nutrients. The host species of Corsia, and whether Corsia are even host specific, remains unknown. Corsia are sometimes found growing in association with other myco-heterotrophic plants like Burmannia, Sciaphila, and Cotylanthera tenuis. Taxonomy Corsia sp. from the Mount Hagen area of Papua New Guinea Corsia is classified under the family Corsiaceae of the order Liliales. It is one of the three genera currently classified under Corsiaceae, the other two being Corsiopsis of China and Arachnitis of South America. It differs from the latter two in having several shoots arising from creeping rhizomes. Corsia was first described in 1877 by the Italian naturalist Odoardo Beccari from specimens from New Guinea. He named it after the Marquis Bardo Corsi Salviati. It was classified under Burmanniaceae by the English botanist George Bentham in 1883 and grouped together with orchids (family Orchidaceae). In 1938, Fredrik Pieter Jonker separated Arachnitis and Corsia from Burmanniaceae based on their strongly zygomorphic floral characteristics. Kores et al. (1978) also separated Corsia from Burmanniaceae after comparing the chromosome numbers of C. cornuta and C. clypeata (2n = 18) with the rest of Burmanniaceae (2n=32 to 136). Dahlgren & Clifford (1982) tentatively reclassified Corsiaceae as closer to lilies (order Liliales) than to orchids. Cribb et al. (1995) noted the significant differences between Corsia and the only other member of Corsiaceae then - Arachnitis. In 1996, Ibisch et al. challenged the monophyly of Corsiaceae, positing that Arachnitis may actually be more closely related to Orchidaceae than Corsia and recommended the separation of the former into its own family, Arachnitaceae. Corsiopsis was discovered in 1999 by Zhang et al. and became the third genus included in the family Corsiaceae. Zhang also remarked that Corsiopsis seem to be more closely related to Corsia than to Arachnitis. Based on phylogenetic studies and reexamination of previous morphological studies, Neyland & Hennigan (2003) concluded that Corsia is not closely related to Arachnitis. The former probably has closer affinities with Campynemataceae of Liliales, while the latter may be more closely related to Thismia and/or Burmannia of Dioscoreales.P. F. Stevens (2001 onwards). \\"Liliales\\". Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, June 2008. Retrieved 30 December 2011. However, Chase et al. (2006) concluded that Arachnitis falls within Liliales while Rudall & Eastman (2002) puts Corsia closer to either Campynemataceae or Thismia. As such, the taxonomic placement of Corsia and Corsiaceae remains problematic though they have been tentatively included in Liliales. Corsia contains two sections, Unguiculatis and Sessilis, with 25 species.

These objects may be complex industrial landscapes, such as buildings, small indoor objects or theatrical stages. By using specialized software, a two- or three- dimensional object is spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the real environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object. This technique is used by artists and advertisers alike who can add extra dimensions, optical illusions, and notions of movement onto previously static objects. The video is commonly combined with, or triggered by, audio to create an audio-visual narrative. In recent years this technique has also been widely used in the context of cultural heritage as it has proved to be an excellent edutainment tool thanks to the combined use of a digital dramaturgy. History Although the term \\"projection mapping\\" is relatively new, the technique dates back to the late 1960s, where it was referred to as the Madame Leota effect, video mapping, spatial augmented reality, or shader lamps. One of the first public displays of projections onto 3D objects was debuted in 1969, when Disneyland opened their Haunted Mansion ride, which featured singing busts. Head shots of the singers were filmed on 16mm film and then projected onto busts of their faces to make them appear animated. Another early example of projection mapping was in the 1967 TV movie Magical Mystery Tour during the Blue Jay Way scene, where images were projected onto George Harrison, including a cat's face and a headless male torso with the words \\"Magical Mystical Boy\\" written on its chest. The next record of projection mapping is from 1980, when installation artist Michael Naimark filmed people interacting with objects in a living room and then projected it in the room, creating illusions as if the people interacting with the objects were really there. In 1984 the Stephen Sondheim original Broadway production of Sunday in the Park With George, written and directed by James LaPine, was the first known use of projection mapping in a Broadway musical or play. Projection mapping was used at the end of Act II, in the Chromolume #7 special effects sequence designed by Bran Ferren to project geometrically-correct moving cinematic images onto the surface of the 4' diameter sphere topping the Chromolume device. Note; due to the brightness limitations of available video projection technology of the time, the images were projected using 7000w xenon illuminated, 35mm motion picture film (projected at 48 frames per second). The images on the film were digitally pre-distorted, to provide the necessary warping, to map correctly onto the sphere from the high projection angle in the Booth theater. The first time the concept of projection mapping was investigated academically was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the late 1990s, where a team led by Ramesh Raskar worked on a project called Office of the Future to connect offices from different locations by projecting people into the office space as if they were really there. By 2001, more artists began using projection mapping in artwork, and groups such as Microsoft began experimenting with it as a means of technological advancement. Methods The Sydney Opera House during the 2013 Vivid Sydney projection display After the object which will be projected on is chosen or created, software is used to map the corners of the video to the surfaces. First, one must choose the images or video to project. Then, place each video on to its designated surface. Alternatively, one may choose to map the entire scene in 3D and attempt to project and mask the image back onto its framework. The next step is defined as \\"masking,\\" which means using opacity templates to actually \\"mask\\" the exact shapes and positions of the different elements of the building or space of projection. In 3D Mapping, coordinates need to be defined for where the object is placed in relation to the projector, the XYZ orientation, position, and lens specification of the projector have to result to a determined virtual scene. One such tool to help achieve this end is BLAM! add-on for Blender's open source 3D animation suite. Adjustments are commonly needed and made by manually tweaking either the physical or virtual scene for best results. Large projectors with 20,000 lumens output or greater are used for large-scale projections such as on city skyscrapers. Due to the sheer scale and brightness required for some projects, often large arrays of powerful projectors will combine into a single image through a method known as \\"edge blending\\" or \\"stacking\\". The result is a much brighter projection that maintains its seamless look. This is at the root of most large projection mapping shows, and requires skill and patience to set up in specialised software. Otherwise, for smaller productions, smaller projectors with less output will work. A 2200 lumen projector is adequate for projections under indoor light or theatrical lighting in most cases. Video mapping software such as MadMapper, HeavyM, Qlab, Troixatronix's Isadora, Fa√ßadeSignage, ArKaos MediaMaster and GrandVJ and VPT 6.0 are all downloadable for use in projects like these, though Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Blender Blam!, and other packages can also be used by a creative artist. Also, extensible open- source software frameworks such as MPM (Multi-Projector-Mapper) are available among others. Projection mapping can be separated into four categories: * VJ'ing or VeeJay-ing (video Jockeying) used where live events are augmented by (often interactive to music) projections which are fully dynamic, controlled live, and consist of pre-programmed videos and combinations of effects and effect overlays. * Theatrical: where projections are preset and scenes are \\"cued\\" on demand, usually in a set order, in conjunction with dance or onstage performance, often interactive. * Static/Interactive: where a display is set up and loops or interacts with the environment and viewers via programming. * Video: where a generally long segmented show is present as a single fluid video that is not interactive and plays from beginning to end. Productions, advertisement and art Projection mapping at F√™te des Lumi√®res by P. Warrener in Lyon (2008) Projection mapping on Cinderella Castle Projection mapping first came to prominence through guerrilla advertising campaigns and video jockeys for electronic musicians. Large companies such as Nokia, Samsung, Unilever Pakistan, Pakistan Tobacco company, Bank Alfalah, Brighto Paints, Benson & Hedges, John Players Gold Leaf and BMW have since used video projections to create campaigns for their products in major cities across the world. These advertising campaigns commonly use mapping techniques to project scenes onto the sides of buildings and churches. Projection mapping can also be interactive, as Nokia Ovi Maps did a project in which the projections would mimic people's movements. Projection mapping has been used at conferences as a means of decoration or immersing audience members in an experienced-based theme. This can be as elaborate as projecting onto a flat surface, or projecting onto an unusual object such as a car or a chair. The festival F√™te des Lumi√®res in Lyon, a festival to honour the Virgin Mary, has recently also started incorporating 3D mapping into their productions, creating the illusion of a giant pinball machine on the side of a building. Common techniques for these performances included both 3-D mapping techniques and 3D projection to create the illusion of depth, as well as motion such as crumbling buildings. It is also being used in technology such as Domes where it is combined with Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to create 360 degree projections for a more immersive experience. The use of projection mapping in TV and films is becoming more popular. For the sci-fi flick Oblivion, the directors used projection mapping to create an immersive environment. For a 2016 TV commercial, Audi used projection mapping to showcase the technology of the Audi Q7 model. The ad, titled Projection of Greatness, was filmed with no CGI and used only content that was caught live in camera. In the electronic dance music (EDM) community, it is becoming increasingly common for DJs to accompany their music with synced visuals. It can either be pre-recorded, or played live by a Video Jockey(VJ). Though normal projection screens are commonly used, some visual artists are beginning to create custom made, 3D installations to project onto. Many EDM artists employ projection mapping techniques at many of their shows. Artists who are solely visual also use projection mapping as a means of creative expression, believing that it can enhance existing creative mediums such as painting and drawing. Artists may use it as an avant garde form of expression as it is new technology that can turn their creative ideas into 3D projections, connecting with audiences in a new way. Video projections have appeared in urban centres such as New York City and London, where artists have used guerilla projections in public without any necessary approval. This way, artists can show their work in any location as anything and anywhere can be a canvas. Often people also use it as a means of activism; the group Occupy Wall Street has used it to project onto the Verizon Wireless building in New York City as a means to visually spread the word that Occupy Wall Street is still alive. The Japanese theatre play Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&II; (2012-14) is notable for the first major use of projection mapping in Japanese theatre stage play. Recently, projection mapping has been used more and more frequently by Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Creative Entertainment in the Disney Parks. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, The Magic, the Memories and You, Disney Dreams!, Celebrate the Magic, Once Upon a Time, Disneyland Forever, Halloween Screams, Believe... In Holiday Magic, Remember... Dreams Come True, Happily Ever After and most recently Sunset Seasons Greetings at Disney's Hollywood Studios. When Paul Oakenfold became the first DJ to perform live at Stonehenge, projection mapping was used to transform the prehistoric monument into a spectacular light show. In order to avoid causing damage to the ancient stones, only 50 of Oakenfold's close friends were invited, and they all had to wear noise-cancelling headphones in order to hear the music above the nearby A303 road.

Developed by Robomodo and published by Activision, Pro Skater HD is a high-definition remake of classic levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Pro Skater 2, and, via download, Pro Skater 3. It was released for Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade on July 18, 2012, for PlayStation 3 through PlayStation Network on August 28, 2012, and Steam on September 18, 2012. The game was delisted from Steam and all other digital marketplaces on July 17, 2017. Gameplay Developer Robomodo worked closely with Tony Hawk to recreate both gameplay and visuals in a new, high-definition environment. Top: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD; bottom: The original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding video game, with an arcade-style emphasis with regard to realism. The objective is to score points by successfully completing various skateboarding tricks such as grinds, flip tricks, and aerials. Performing several moves in succession without any pause results in a combo. The player's score is multiplied by the number of tricks in the combo. If the player successfully lands the final trick the score is then banked, otherwise all points in that combo are lost. Pro Skater HD is an amalgam of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and as such the game does not feature any additional tricks or moves added to later games in the series. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 downloadable content (DLC) was announced on July 3, 2012. Included in the content is the ability to perform a revert, a trick which involves changing the direction of the board while keeping forward momentum. Originally this ability was only going to be limited for use in the levels that came with the DLC but due to the protracted release schedule, Robomodo released an update for the game that added the revert in all levels. Players are also tasked with completing objectives in each level. In exchange for completion of these objectives players are rewarded with points that can be spent to upgrade a character's attributes. These include achieving a set high score, collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, and finding a hidden DVD (in the same vein of the \\"Secret Tapes\\" from the first three games) within each level. In addition to the main gameplay mode other single and multiplayer modes are included. Big Head Survival is a new game mode in which the player character skates with their head becoming gradually inflated. In the case of Xbox 360 avatars the head is represented by a balloon in tow. If the player's head or balloon becomes too large it pops, ending the game. To keep the size down players must complete combos. Higher scores have a greater impact on decreasing the player character's head or balloon size. Returning from Tony Hawk's Project 8 is Hawkman, where the player must skate around the level collecting colored pellets with specific moves: yellow pellets must be collected during grinds, red during jumps, green during manuals, and blue while wallriding. When the player collects all pellets, or fails to collect them within the time limit for a high score, the game ends. Graffiti mode returns, and involves performing tricks on a series of objects. If a player successfully lands their trick(s), all objects the player touched will change to the player's designated color. If a second player achieves a higher score any objects that the second player touched, including any claimed by the first player, will change to the second player's color. The object is to claim the most objects by the end of the game. Online leaderboards are included for all modes, but online play is limited to the console versions. Seven levels were selected from the original Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2, and include series staples such as Warehouse and School II. Mall, Hangar, Marseille, Downhill Jam, and Venice Beach are also included. The selection of skaters consist of classic skaters such as Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen, as well as other professional skaters Eric Koston, Nyjah Huston, Andrew Reynolds, Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Chris Cole and Riley Hawk, son of Tony Hawk. The first update of the game also adds Jake Harrison and Emily Westlund to the initial roster. Two fictional bonus characters return, Officer Dick and Ollie the Magic Bum, who have appeared several times in the series. A new bonus character, a robot named Roberta, is also included. The Xbox 360 version also allows players to play with their avatars. Downloadable content has been released featuring three levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (Airport, Canada, and Los Angeles) with extra playable characters including pros Geoff Rowley and Steve Caballero along with James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo from Metallica. The pack also includes one new song from the band, \\"All Nightmare Long\\". Development The game was first announced at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards show (VGAs) with a trailer demonstrating Tony Hawk skating around the Woodland Hills Warehouse (the first stage of the original game). It is the first Tony Hawk's game on consoles that was offered exclusively as a downloadable game. It is a return to the gameplay of the original games in the series, predating Tony Hawk: Ride, and as such could only be played using a standard controller. The game is not a high-definition port of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but rather an amalgamation of levels collected from the first two installments, remade using Unreal Engine 3 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Downloadable content from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was announced on July 3, 2012. The levels Airport, Los Angeles, and Canada have been confirmed, and players are able to perform reverts on those levels. Professional skater Steve Caballero was also confirmed via screenshot on July 20, 2012. Geoff Rowley was later confirmed as a second skater for the pack. Soundtrack On March 8, 2012 Tony Hawk mentioned in an interview with Destructoid that half of the soundtrack would contain songs from the first two Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games with the other half containing new songs. The soundtrack was announced on May 23, 2012. As Hawk stated, seven songs are new, while seven are taken from the first two Pro Skater games; one from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and six from Pro Skater 2. Developer Robomodo was given charge of the soundtrack. In regards to the choice of new songs, lead designer Patrick Dwyer stated \\"We wanted to pick new songs that had that potential where, five years from now, people hear the songs and they think of this game.\\" Reception Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD has received mixed reviews upon release. It currently holds aggregates scores of 67.61% at GameRankings and 66 out of 100 at Metacritic. Review scores range from a 40% approval ratio from Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar to a 90% approval from Alex Rubens of G4TV. The majority of scores at both GameRankings and Metacritic were at or above a 60% approval ratio. IGN's Nic Vargas gave the game a score of 8/10, praising its purist gameplay whilst lamenting the lack of certain modes such as park creator and split screen multiplayer. The reviewer from GameTrailers gave the game a score of 7.4 and stated that Pro Skater HD \\"isn't flawless, but... it at least gets off on the right foot.\\" Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar felt that \\"old-school fans of the franchise will be disappointed by what the game lacks, and gamers who‚Äôve never laid eyes on a PS1 will find the mechanics and level design sparse.\\" Destructoid gave the game 4.5/10, stating that the execution isn't handled as well as the original titles, as well as some of the design choices the developer made. G4TV gave the game a 4.5/5 and praised the console versions' online multiplayer and soundtrack. Official Xbox Magazine gave Pro Skater HD an 8/10. They praised the game's new big head mode.

Kean ceased his playing career after the 1948‚Äì49 season and then worked for Hibs as an assistant trainer. He moved to Dundee in the late 1950s, assisting Bob Shankly with their league championship winning team in 1962. Kean was credited with the signing of Gordon Smith, as the pair had a working relationship dating back to shifts in the Leith shipyards during the war. Kean also coached Falkirk and Partick Thistle. Kean worked for the Gas Board for the rest of his working life. Besides football, he was also a keen golfer and lawn bowls player.

She gave various accounts of her background and age, suggesting connections with Yorkshire and Scottish Highland gentry. Society for Psychical Research Freer joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1888 with the support of F. W. H. Myers. After criticism of her work on the Ballechin House case in 1897, her work was repudiated by the SPR and she abandoned psychical research. W. T. Stead and Borderland Campaigning journalist William Thomas Stead had become increasingly interested in spiritualism in the 1890s. In 1893 he founded a spiritualist quarterly, called Borderland, in which he gave full play to his interest in psychical research. The focus of the publication was on spiritualism and psychical research, mainly from a supportive point of view. The magazine appeared quarterly, priced 1/6.Brake & Demoor (2009) p.65 As with the Review of Reviews, Stead was both proprietor and editor. He employed Freer as assistant editor: she was also a substantial contributor under her usual pseudonym \\"Miss X\\".Hall (1980) pp.45‚Äì52 Stead claimed that he was in the habit of communicating with Freer by telepathy and automatic writing. The magazine ceased publication in October 1897. Clandon House Freer was involved in the investigation of the Clandon House haunting in 1895, funded by the Marquess of Bute. It was alleged that she reported the stories of the domestic staff rather than her own observations. Second sight Freer was commissioned by the SPR in 1894, on the recommendation of F.W.H. Myers, to conduct an enquiry into second sight in the Hebrides in 1894-5, again funded by the Marquess of Bute.Chapman (1978) Much of her report was taken from the work of Father Allan MacDonald of Eriskay, whom she met on her second visit in 1895. She published reports under own name, in the journal Folklore and elsewhere, but concealed the extent of her dependence on MacDonald's material. Ballechin House Freer was involved in the investigation of Ballechin House by the Society for Psychical Research, her report being published jointly by herself and the Marquess of Bute. Her work was strongly criticised by J. Callendar Ross in The Times in 1897, and led to a controversy over the bona fides of the investigators. Personal life Historian Trevor H. Hall has argued that Freer was having an affair with F.W.H. Myers at the time that he introduced her to psychic research and the SPR.Hall (1980) pp.35‚Äì37 Trevor Hamilton dismisses this and suggests that Freer was simply using her acquaintance with Myers to gain status in the psychical research movement.Hamilton (2009) p.231 Myers supported her socially and possibly financially. Author John Grant has suggested that Myers was a womanizer who was easily duped and \\"probably seduced\\" by Freer.\\" According to Grant, Freer made false claims about herself: :Right at the outset, she deceived [Myers] and many others within the SPR ‚Äî as to her antecedents: She said she was a descendant of a noble Scottish family; she was, in fact the daughter of a Leicestershire vet. Neither was she, as she asserted, the first female fellow of the Royal Society. And she was not a teenager when Myers met her, as she told everyone, but a thirty-year old woman, having been born in 1857. Freer lived with Constance Moore, daughter of Canon Daniel Moore (1809‚Äì1899) and sister of Aubrey Lackington Moore, from 1880 to 1901.Hall (1980) p.30 Freer initially lived with the Moore family at Holy Trinity Vicarage, Paddington, and later shared a house with Constance in Bushey Heath.Hall (1980) p.112 There is evidence that their relationship was sado- masochistic.Hall (1980) p.116 She worked as a medium in London, until she was caught cheating at a s√©ance. In December 1901 Freer went to Jerusalem, where in 1905 she married Dr Hans Henry Spoer, an American scholar of ancient languages: he believed her to be some 17 years younger than her true age. She returned to Britain from 1909‚Äì11 while her husband was training for ordination at Lichfield Theological College and they then moved to Cairo. In 1923 they moved to Detroit; in 1926 to Sycamore, Illinois and then to New York where her husband was chaplain to the New York Mission Society.Campbell (2004)Hall (1980) pp.124‚Äì126 Freer died in St Luke's Hospital, New York, on 24 February 1931.

It can be reached along a cliff top path, 11 kilometres long in total, that runs from Sassnitz to Lohme, or from the large car park in Hagen (in the municipality of Lohme) 3 km away. Since 2004, entry to the National Park Centre, and hence access to K√∂nigsstuhl, has been subject to a charge. The narrow yet massive granite steps that lead to the plateau on K√∂nigsstuhl, 200 m¬≤ in area, lie over the site of what is suspected to be a Bronze Age barrow. From the plateau there is a sweeping view of the Baltic Sea. K√∂nigsstuhl itself is best seen from the viewing point of Victoria View (Victoria-Sicht) to the south. There is a legend that the name K√∂nigsstuhl (\\"King's Chair\\") goes back to an event in 1715 when the Swedish king, Charles XII is supposed to have commanded a sea battle against the Danes from this spot. The battle tired the ruler so much that he needed to take a chair. However, the name K√∂nigsstuhl was used in a travel report by the vicar, Rhenan, in 1586, who had been tasked by the Pomeranian duke to find mineral springs; thus it is clear that it had been named much earlier. According to a legend, the name is actually derived from a custom whereby in ancient times the person elected king was the first to climb the cliffs from the sea and sit in the chair on the top.

A prank results in Violet being chosen to lead the team's research project, studying people choosing to eat stale donuts. Tom and Violet's nuptials are further delayed when Winton receives NIH funding with Violet's help and extends her program a few more years. Tom is upset by the news, and he and Violet fight over his unhappiness with their new lives. As years pass, Tom becomes disillusioned and obsessed with hunting. Alex, Suzie, and their daughter Vanessa visit, and reveal Suzie is pregnant again. Tom responds that he no longer wants to have a child, surprising Violet, who offers to look after Vanessa with Tom, but the night turns into a disaster after Vanessa shoots Violet with Tom's crossbow. Tom's downward spiral becomes evident when Violet sees him eat a stale donut. At a bar with colleagues, a drunken Violet and Winton kiss, which Violet instantly regrets. She tells Tom that she wants to plan their wedding immediately, and he happily agrees. When Violet confesses to kissing Winton, Tom loses faith in their relationship, which reaches a climax when Winton comes to their rehearsal dinner to apologize. Tom chases Winton away, and leaves to get drunk alone. He runs into Margaret, an amorous co-worker, but opts not to have sex with her, and wakes up half-naked in the snow with a frostbitten toe, which is amputated. Violet visits Tom at the hospital, and they call off their engagement once they arrive home. Violet starts a relationship with Winton but often reminisces about Tom, who wishes her a happy birthday via email, including a video of Ming's ridiculous experiment on his friend Tarquin. Violet calls Tom, who has returned to San Francisco, working as a sous-chef under Alex and dating the hostess, Audrey. Their friendly-but-awkward conversation takes a turn as they argue over Violet's stale donuts experiment as a metaphor for their relationship, and both end the call upset. Realizing Tom's unhappiness, Alex fires him, telling him that he is the better chef and should open his own franchise, and Tom launches a popular taco truck. Violet receives an assistant professorship, but learns she was hired because she is dating Winton, and breaks up with him. After lunch with his parents, Tom decides to win Violet back, and breaks up with Audrey. He surprises Violet at her grandparent's funeral in England, and they agree to spend the remainder of the summer together in San Francisco, rekindling their relationship while sharing an apartment and working side by side in the taco truck. Driving Violet to the airport, Tom offers to take his truck to Michigan and continue their relationship. Violet proposes to Tom at the side of the road, just as he did five years before, and Tom reveals the ring he originally gave her, explaining that he was planning to re-propose at the airport. They head to Alamo Square Park where Violet has organized their family and friends for an impromptu wedding. Tom chooses between Violet's various options for the officiant, clothing, and music, and they finally marry. Tom and Violet share their first kiss as a married couple, and the film flashes back to their first kiss when they first met at a New Year's Eve party. The film ends as Alex and Suzie sing ‚ÄúCucurrucuc√∫ paloma‚Äù on a carriage ride with the newly-wedded couple.

Habitat and behaviour Starfishes of genus Astropecten live on mobile seabed (sandy, muddy or gravel seabed) and they remain largely buried under sediment during the day. During the late afternoon and during the night starfishes go out to hunt mainly bivalve molluscs, which are their favourite preys. This species lives only in the Mediterranean Sea and it prefers sandy seabed near meadows of Cymodocea nodosa and it lives at depths between 2 and 100 m. This species is active and easy to find especially in the late afternoon, but sometimes it is possible to find it during the day or during the night. Description This sea star has very narrow and high superomarginal plates with a bare area on vertical face of them (visible in the lateral side of arms between inferomarginal spines and superomarginal spines). Every superomarginal plate is equipped with 1 very long, sharp, clean conical spine usually white colour but sometime yellow or orange. The superomarginal spine is always placed on the top internal edge of plates so there aren‚Äôt any bare area on top of superomarginal plates. The maximum number of superomarginal plates, observed on each arm, is 77; normally the number is between 40 and 60, depending on the size of the starfish. The pair of superomarginal spines between the arms is often longer than the other. The inferomarginal spines are long, flat, not pointed, usually kept parallel and well separated. Feature shape of this Astropecten has a very small disc and very long and thin arms. The aboral side has uniform colour and can be dark green, dark brown or rarely light brown-pink. The oral side is light coloured, usually white but it can be also yellow or orange. It has size quite large and may reach about 21 cm in diameter. This is a kind of starfish that can be distinguished by feature‚Äôs shape, the high number of superomarginal plates, the bare area on vertical face of superomarginal plates, the conical superomarginal spines and by the colour. This species may be confused with Astropecten platyacanthus. Feeding Astropecten bispinosus This sea star is a carnivore and feeds on molluscs, which it catches with its arms and then takes to the mouth. The prey is then trapped by the long, moving prickles around the mouth cavity. References * Roberto Pillon (2009). Astropecten of the Mediterranean Sea * Koehler, R√©n√©. 1921. Faune de France.

The game took place on December 10, 2011 at Xavier's home arena, the Cintas Center in Norwood. Background The Crosstown Shootout has always been one of the more intense rivalries in college basketball, all the more so because Xavier and UC are only two miles () apart. There has always been a fair amount of trash talk between the two schools, and the 2011 game was no different. On December 8, UC guard Sean Kilpatrick told Andy Furman of WQRT that Xavier's All-American guard Tu Holloway probably wouldn't start for the Bearcats \\"with the players that we have now.\\"Russell, Shannon. Kilpatrick: Holloway wouldn't start at UC. The Cincinnati Enquirer, 2011-12-08. The series had developed a history of bad blood in the years leading up to the 2011 Crosstown Shootout. In 2008, a total of six technicals were called in a 76-66 XU win. XU's Derrick Brown was ejected, and two freshman post players were involved in an altercation that included a heavy dose of foreshadowing: XU's Kenny Frease head-butted UC's Yancy Gates (both players received technicals). The altercation between Frease and Gates in 2008 set the tone for bad blood between the two, and may have motivated Gates to seek revenge in 2011. In 2009, multiple verbal exchanges resulting in UC clearing their bench as well as technicals called on XU's Jordan Crawford and UC's Rashad Bishop in XU's double overtime win. In 2010, Xavier's Tu Holloway received a technical foul for throwing an elbow late in UC's 66-46 win. The brawl The game was close at first, with eight ties and six lead changes in the first half. Xavier led 34-25 at halftime.Russell, Shannon. Brouhaha mars Xavier's 76-53 win against UC at Cintas Center. The Cincinnati Enquirer, 2011-12-11. The first sign of trouble occurred in the closing seconds of the first half, when Bearcat backup Octavius Ellis began exchanging some words with Xavier player Mark Lyons from the bench. Ellis jumped up from the bench to confront Lyons, and the two players had to be separated. Before the start of the second half, according to Xavier coach Chris Mack, both teams were warned that any further incident would result in technical fouls.Jackson, Zac. Xavier-UC rivalry hits rock bottom. Fox Sports Ohio, 2011-12-11. The Musketeers started the second half on a 9-2 run and were never seriously threatened afterward.Bench-clearing melee halts end of Xavier's rout of Cincinnati. Associated Press via ESPN, 2011-12-10. Ultimately, the Musketeers outscored the Bearcats 42-28 in the second half. With 18.6 seconds remaining, Tu Holloway scored a layup to give the Musketeers the 76-53 lead. As Holloway walked to the other end of the court, he began shouting at the Bearcat bench, bringing UC's Ge'Lawn Guyn over to confront him, leading to an argument between both men. As Guyn reached for Holloway's throat, Xavier's Dezmine Wells intervened by pushing Guyn to the ground, causing UC's Yancy Gates to throw the ball at Holloway's head, and both benches to empty. In the ensuing fight, Gates punched Xavier's Kenny Frease in the face, opening up a large cut under Frease's left eye and knocking him to the ground. As Frease tried to crawl away from the crowd, UC's Cheikh Mbodj stomped on the back of his head. Ellis threw a punch at Lyons, causing him and Wells to throw several back, before coaches got in between them. This brought Gates over, who began shouting and throwing more punches at a Xavier backup, until Xavier assistant Aaron Williams and Lyons calmed him down.ESPN highlights of game Referees Michael Roberts, Jeff Anderson, and Tony Crisp ended the game with 9.4 seconds remaining, giving Xavier the 76-53 win. UC's Gates and Mbodj, and Xavier's Wells were retroactively ejected from the game for fighting. Under NCAA rules, they were suspended for their next game, a sanction that cannot be appealed. Immediately following the incident, both sides were escorted to the tunnels at either end of the court so that they would enter their respective locker rooms. However, due to the chaos of the brawl, both teams entered through the tunnels opposite from where they were supposed to go. This would have resulted in another confrontation in the hallways beneath the Cintas Center stands as both teams would have had to cross each other in the narrow hallway leading to their locker rooms. To avoid this, the Xavier team was corralled into the south tunnel leading out of the main arena. Once the UC players were off the court and had filed through the north tunnel to their locker room, the Xavier players were brought back out and began celebrating with the remaining fans and students still in the stands. This however resulted in an incident between the Xavier players and the Cincinnati fans who began yelling obscenities at one another. Security again had to get involved to keep the two groups away from each other. Aftermath UC coach Mick Cronin, angry at how his players behaved, ordered them to take off their jerseys in the locker room, and in some cases physically took them off. In his postgame comments, a visibly angry Cronin said that he told his players not to put them on again \\"until they have a full understanding of where they go to school and what the university stands for and how lucky they are to even be there, let alone have a scholarship.\\" He also hinted that several players could face suspensions, and possibly dismissal from the team, saying that he was going to review the tape with school president Gregory H. Williams and athletic director Whit Babcock \\"and decide who's going to be on my team going forward.\\" He also appeared to blame the referees for not taking control of the situation sooner (threats of technicals after the first-half incident notwithstanding), saying that Musketeer players were yelling at his bench for the whole game and even cursing at his coaches. Cronin said he tried to call a time out before the brawl broke out so the players could go to their respective benches, but couldn't get the officials' attention.Mick Cronin postgame comments In the postgame interview, Holloway claimed the Bearcats had \\"disrespected\\" his teammates in the run-up to the game. He also said, \\"We went out there and zipped them up at the end of the game.\\" He also added that he and his teammates considered themselves \\"gangsters, not thugs, but tough guys on the court.\\" Lyons added, \\"If somebody puts their hand in your face or tries to do something to you, where we're from you're gonna do something back.\\" Later that night, Cronin spoke with ESPN's Andy Katz and reiterated that there would be additional suspensions coming. \\"Nobody is going to walk on our side,\\" he said. He also said this was the most embarrassing moment of his coaching career. Mack was somewhat more restrained in his remarks, saying he wasn't \\"in a position to be a decision maker,\\" but that his players needed to learn \\"how to handle themselves and not let that happen again.\\" Earlier, Mack had tweeted, \\"If my players say they've been taught to be tough their whole life, they mean ON THE FLOOR. Nothing else is condoned.\\"Katz, Andy. Penalties pending after Cincinnati brawl. ESPN, 2011-12-11. Both schools' presidents issued statements condemning the brawl. UC's Williams strongly supported Cronin's postgame remarks, saying that the brawl was \\"not what we expect of representatives of the University of Cincinnati\\" and that school officials would \\"act swiftly and firmly\\" to ensure it never happened again.Statement on brawl from UC president Gregory Williams Xavier's Michael J. Graham called the brawl \\"unsportsmanlike\\" and apologized to Xavier's fans and \\"the entire Cincinnati community.\\"Statement from Xavier president Michael J. Graham The Big East Conference and Atlantic 10 Conference, the home conferences for UC and Xavier respectively at the time, also condemned the brawl and promised to hand down additional suspensions if they felt the schools haven't acted harshly enough. On December 11, both schools announced suspensions for the players involved. UC suspended Gates, Mbodj and Ellis for six games each, and Guyn for one game. Cronin said that the four players would still have to earn their way back onto the team even after they serve out their suspensions. At the very least, Cronin said, they would have to sincerely apologize on camera and complete several other unspecified tasks. Xavier suspended Wells and Landen Amos for four games, Lyons for two and Holloway for one. Xavier athletic director Mike Bobinski also apologized for Holloway and Lyons' postgame remarks. Mack said that Holloway was suspended specifically for his postgame comments, and admitted that neither he nor Lyons should have been before the media.Cincinnati, Xavier reveal suspensions. ESPN, 2011-12-11. On December 11, Mack, Holloway, Lyons and Xavier Athletic Director Mike Bobinski all apologized for what occurred. Mike Bobinski said, \\"It was an embarrassment. It was a disappointment at every level. We take full responsibility for the role that we played in those events and are resolved to whatever is necessary to see to it that it never happens again.\\" Tu Holloway also apologized for post game comments saying, \\"Myself, I used the wrong choice of words. I represent Xavier University, my family and myself and I really apologize for what took place.\\" On December 12, an emotional Gates apologized for his actions, saying they were \\"not what my family is about.\\" Guyn, Ellis and Mbodj also apologized.Koch, Bill. Tearful Yancy Gates, UC apologize for role in Xavier game. The Cincinnati Enquirer, 2011-12-12. On the same day, Hamilton County, Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters said he was considering filing criminal charges related to the brawl. Under Ohio law, Deters' office would handle the case if the charges rose to the level of felonies; Cincinnati city solicitor John Curp would prosecute if they are only misdemeanors. There is no known instance of criminal charges being filed as a result of a brawl at an NCAA game.Perry, Kimball.Prosecutors explore possible criminal charges for UC, Xavier. The Cincinnati Enquirer, 2011-12-12. Two days later, Deters announced he would not file charges. He also indicated that Gates and Frease had \\"reached out to each other privately\\", and that Frease was satisfied with a personal apology from Gates. On that same day XU athletic Director Mike Bobinski used head coach Chris Mack's radio show to again apologize and take questions from fans concerning the incident. On December 18, prior to Xavier's game against Oral Roberts, Mack took the floor again to apologize for the incident that had occurred in the previous game. Mack said, \\"We were all embarrassed by our behavior last weekend,\\" and added, \\"It's extremely disappointing and in no way was a representation of what our university and our basketball program is all about.\\" Partly due to the incident, Xavier and UC officials decided to move the game to U.S. Bank Arena for at least the next two seasons and rename it the Crosstown Classic. Player and fan behavior was extensively reevaluated after the 2013 game, and was said to be a major factor in the decision to continue the series beyond the 2013‚Äì14 season. On May 12, 2014, the two schools announced a 10-year agreement to continue the series, alternating between campuses, and to revert the name of the series back to the Crosstown Shootout.

Episodes Episode One: The Age of Invasions The series aims to explore Irish history using the historical facts and evidence while charting the origin and impact of the numerous myths that have been passed off as history in the past. Key to this approach is relating developments in Ireland to events and changes in Europe and the world at large as the centuries progress. Areas discussed in the opening episode include the impact of early Christianity and monasticism in Ireland; the birth of Ireland's potent literary culture; the unique law tracts created by Irish lawyers that afford us remarkable insights into the day-to-day lives and habits of ordinary people nearly 1500 years ago. Episode Two: The Age of Conquest As the English set foot in Ireland, there begins 800 years of British rule. This episode examines the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland and the huge upheavals and changes taking place across Europe at the time. Episode Three: The Age of Revolution Spanning the Ulster Plantation to the Act of Union, this is an era that sees Ireland take centre stage in a much wider European conflict. This episode will also investigate Gaelic life and culture during the eighteenth century through poetry, music and the rise of a Roman Catholic middle class. Episode Four: The Age of Union A new area for exploration is Ireland's role in the British Empire - both in terms of military service - Irish regiments holding the Punjab for example, and in terms of intriguing Irish governors and political men posted in various corners of the British Empire. Episode Five: The Age of Nations The Boer War is of much forgotten significance to the Irish story in the early 20th century. A strong theme in the programme is the exploration of Irish nationalism, the welding together of culture, physical force and blood sacrifice, from Patrick Pearse, Connolly and Larkin right through to the beginning of the period known as 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland. And also the opening up of the 60s under Se√°n Lemass brought in a new era of economic openness in the south and its eventual membership of the EEC. There is a look at some key moments in The Troubles.

Journal of Global Optimization 16, no. 1: 23-32. https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1008324625522. Tseng, P. 2000. Nearest q-flat to m points. Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 105, no. 1: 249‚Äì252. is an iterative method which aims to partition m observations into k clusters where each cluster is close to a q-flat, where q is a given integer. It is a generalization of the k-means algorithm. In k-means algorithm, clusters are formed in the way that each cluster is close to one point, which is a 0-flat. k q-flats algorithm gives better clustering result than k-means algorithm for some data set. Description Problem formulation Given a set A of m observations (a_1,a_2,\\\\dots, a_m) where each observation a_i is an n-dimensional real vector, k q-flats algorithm aims to partition m observation points by generating k q-flats that minimize the sum of the squares of distances of each observation to a nearest q-flat. A q-flat is a subset of R^n that is congruent to R^q. For example, a 0-flat is a point; a 1-flat is a line; a 2-flat is a plane; a n-1-flat is a hyperplane. q-flat can be characterized by the solution set of a linear system of equations: F = \\\\\\\\{ x x\\\\in R^n, W'x = \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\}, where W\\\\in R^{n\\\\times (n-q)}, \\\\gamma \\\\in R^{1\\\\times (n-q)}. Denote a partition of \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots, n\\\\\\\\} as S = (S_1,S_2,\\\\dots,S_k). The problem can be formulated as (P1) \\\\min_{F_l,l=1,\\\\dots,k \\\\text{ are q-flats}} \\\\min_S \\\\sum_{l=1}^k \\\\sum_{a_j \\\\in S_i} \\\\a_j - P_{F_i}(a_j) \\\\^2, where P_{F_i}(a_j) is the projection of a_j onto F_i. Note that \\\\a_j - P_{F_i}(a_j) \\\\ = dist(a_j,F_l) is the distance from a_j to F_l. Algorithm The algorithm is similar to the k-means algorithm (i.e. Lloyd's algorithm) in that it alternates between cluster assignment and cluster update. In specific, the algorithm starts with an initial set of q-flats F_l^{(0)} = \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in R^n (W_l^{(0)})'x=\\\\gamma_l^{(0)} \\\\\\\\},l=1,\\\\dots, k , and proceeds by alternating between the following two steps: : Cluster Assignment (given q-flats, assign each point to closest q-flat): the i'th cluster is updated as S_i^{(t)} = \\\\\\\\{a_j  \\\\(W_i^{(t)})'a_j - \\\\gamma_i^{(t)} \\\\_F = \\\\min_{l=1,\\\\dots,k} \\\\(W_l^{(t)})'a_j -\\\\gamma_l^{(t)} \\\\_F \\\\\\\\}. : Cluster Update (given cluster assignment, update the q-flats): For l=1,\\\\dots, k, let A(l)\\\\in R^{m(l)\\\\times n} with rows corresponding to all a_i assigned to cluster l. Set W_l^{(t+1)} to be the matrix whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to the (n-q) least eigenvalues of A(l)'(I-\\\\frac{ee'}{m})A(l) and \\\\gamma_l^{(t+1)} = \\\\frac{e'A(l)W_l^{(t+1)}}{m}. Stop whenever the assignments no longer change. The cluster assignment step uses the following fact: given a q-flat F_l = \\\\\\\\{x W'x=\\\\gamma \\\\\\\\} and a vector a, where W^{\\\\prime} W=I, the distance from a to the q-flat F_l is dist(a,F_l) = min_{x:W^{\\\\prime}x = \\\\gamma}\\\\x-a \\\\_F^2 = \\\\W(W'W)^{-1}(W^{\\\\prime}x - \\\\gamma) \\\\_F^2 = \\\\W^{\\\\prime}x-\\\\gamma \\\\_F^2. The key part of this algorithm is how to update the cluster, i.e. given m points, how to find a q-flat that minimizes the sum of squares of distances of each point to the q-flat. Mathematically, this problem is: given A\\\\in R^{m\\\\times n}, solve the quadratic optimization problem (P2) \\\\min_{W\\\\in R^{n\\\\times (n-q)},\\\\gamma \\\\in R^{1\\\\times (n-q)}} \\\\AW - e\\\\gamma \\\\_F^2, subject to W^{\\\\prime}W=I, where A\\\\in R^{m \\\\times n} is given, and e = (1,\\\\dots, 1)' \\\\in R^{m \\\\times 1}. The problem can be solved using Lagrangian multiplier method and the solution is as given in the cluster update step. It can be shown that the algorithm will terminate in a finite number of iterations (no more than the total number of possible assignments, which is bounded by k^m). In addition, the algorithm will terminate at a point that the overall objective cannot be decreased either by a different assignment or by defining new cluster planes for these clusters (such point is called \\"locally optimal\\" in the references). This convergence result is a consequence of the fact that problem (P2) can be solved exactly. The same convergence result holds for k-means algorithm because the cluster update problem can be solved exactly. Relation to other machine learning methods k-means algorithm k q-flats algorithm is a generalization of k-means algorithm. In fact, k-means algorithm is k 0-flats algorithm since a point is a 0-flat. Despite their connection, they should be used in different scenarios. k q-flats algorithm for the case that data lie in a few low-dimensional spaces.k-means algorithm is desirable for the case the clusters are of the ambient dimension, . For example, if all observations lie in two lines, k q-flats algorithm with q=1 may be used; if the observations are two Gaussian clouds, k-means algorithm may be used.  Sparse Dictionary Learning Natural signals lie in a high- dimensional space. For example, the dimension of a 1024 by 1024 image is about 106, which is far too high for most signal processing algorithms. One way to get rid of the high dimensionality is to find a set of basis functions, such that the high-dimensional signal can be represented by only a few basis functions. In other words, the coefficients of the signal representation lies in a low-dimensional space, which is easier to apply signal processing algorithms. In the literature, wavelet transform is usually used in image processing, and fourier transform is usually used in audio processing. The set of basis functions is usually called a dictionary. However, it is not clear what is the best dictionary to use once given a signal data set. One popular approach is to find a dictionary when given a data set using the idea of Sparse Dictionary Learning. It aims to find a dictionary, such that the signal can be sparsely represented by the dictionary. The optimization problem can be written as follows. \\\\min_{B,R} \\\\X - BR\\\\_{F}^{2} subject to \\\\R_i\\\\_0 \\\\leq q where * X is a d by N matrix. Each columns of X represent a signal, and there are total N signals. * B is a d by l matrix. Each columns of B represent a basis function, and there are total l basis functions in the dictionary. * R is a l by N matrix. R_i (ith columns of R) represent the coefficients when we use the dictionary B to represent the ith columns of X. * \\\\v\\\\_0 denotes the zero-norm of the vector v. * \\\\V\\\\_{F} denotes the Frobenious norm of matrix V. The idea of k q-flats algorithm is similar to sparse dictionary learning in nature. If we restrict the q-flat to q-dimensional subspace, then the k q-flats algorithm is simply finding the closed q-dimensional subspace to a given signal. Sparse dictionary learning is also doing the same thing, except for an additional constraints on the sparsity of the representation. Mathematically, it is possible to show that k q-flats algorithm is of the form of sparse dictionary learning with an additional block structure on R. Let B_k be a d \\\\times q matrix, where columns of B_k are basis of the k^{th} flat. Then the projection of the signal x to the k^{th} flat is B_k r_k , where r_k is a q-dimensional coefficient. Let B = [B_1, \\\\cdots, B_K] denote concatenation of basis of K flats, it is easy to show that the k -q-flat algorithm is the same as the following. \\\\min_{B,R} \\\\X - BR\\\\_{F}^{2} subject to \\\\R_i\\\\_0 \\\\leq q and R has a block structure. The block structure of R refers the fact that each signal is labeled to only one flat. Comparing the two formulations, k q-flat is the same as sparse dictionary modeling when l = K \\\\times q and with an additional block structure on R.

Processing (1) 744615-744615-10 for more discussion about the relationship between the two concept. Applications and variations Classification Classification is a procedure that classifies an input signal into different classes. One example is to classify an email into spam or non-spam classes. Classification algorithms usually require a supervised learning stage. In the supervised learning stage, training data for each class is used for the algorithm to learn the characteristics of the class. In the classification stage, a new observation is classified into a class by using the characteristics that were already trained. k q-flat algorithm can be used for classification. Suppose there are total of m classes. For each class, k flats are trained a priori via training data set. When a new data comes, find the flat that is closest to the new data. Then the new data is associate to class of the closest flat. However, the classification performance can be further improved if we impose some structure on the flats. One possible choice is to require different flats from different class be sufficiently far apart. Some researchers Szlam, A, and G Sapiro. \\"Supervised Learning via Discriminative k q-Flats\\" use this idea and develop a discriminative k q-flat algorithm. K-metrics  In k q-flats algorithm, \\\\x - P_{F} (x)\\\\^2 is used to measure the representation error. P_{F} (x) denotes the projection of x to the flat F. If data lies in a q-dimension flat, then a single q-flat can represent the data very well. On the contrary, if data lies in a very high dimension space but near a common center, then k-means algorithm is a better way than k q-flat algorithm to represent the data. It is because k-means algorithm use \\\\x - x_c\\\\^2 to measure the error, where x_c denotes the center. K-metrics is a generalization that use both the idea of flat and mean. In k-metrics, error is measured by the following Mahalanobis metric. \\\\x - y\\\\_{A}^2 = (x-y)^{T}A(x-y) where A is a positive semi-definite matrix. If A is the identity matrix, then the Mahalanobis metric is exactly the same as the error measure used in k-means. If A is not the identity matrix, then \\\\x-y\\\\_{A}^{2} will favor certain directions as the k q-flat error measure.

Habitat and behaviour Starfishes of genus Astropecten live on mobile seabed (sandy, muddy or gravel seabed) and they remain largely buried under sediment during the day. During the late afternoon and the night starfishes go out to hunt mainly bivalve molluscs, which are their favourite preys. This species lives only in the Mediterranean Sea and it lives on all mobile seabed at depths between 1 and 60 m, but it is more frequently in seabed of mixed coarse sand and mud at 1‚Äì4 m depth. This species is active and easy to find during the night but also during the day, especially in early morning and late afternoon. Description It has narrow and high superomarginal plates, laterally covered with scales and small spines (on vertical face). Every superomarginal plates is equipped with one strong spine, usually sharp but irregularly shaped, slightly flattened laterally, often yellow or orange but rarely off white. Sometimes, especially in young specimen, only superomarginal plates between the arms are equipped with one strong spine while others are not (in some rare specimens all the superomarginal plates are totally devoid of spines). In populations of certain areas of the Mediterranean (for example, the South of Corsica) this feature is very frequent. The superomarginal spines are (more or less) far from the inside edge of plates and they leave on top, on the base of them, a small bare area that it is white if there is a strong spine in the plate (usually in the plates near the disc) or blue-violet if the plate has very small spine or no spine (usually towards the tip of arms). The maximum number of superomarginal plates, observed on each arm, is 48; normally the number is between 29 and 43, depending on the size of the starfish. The inferomarginal spines are long, flat and quite pointed. It is an Astropecten with very variables features and it can have wide or narrow arms. The aboral side has very variables colours and it can be more or less dark brown, olive green, pink-brown, bluish-grey. The oral side usually is yellow-brown. Normally it reaches a diameter of 9‚Äì12 cm and exceptionally it can measure up to 18 cm. It is the Mediterranean Astropecten hardest to identify both for the variability of features of the species, both for the resemblance to some other species. It is distinguished from Astropecten bispinosus mainly for the superomarginal spines far from the inside edge of plates and they leave on top, on the base of them, a small bare area. Another important Astropecten platyacanthus‚Äôs feature is that the superomarginal plates are laterally, on vertical face, covered with scales and small spines rather than nude. Moreover, it is different because it has smaller, irregularly shaped, laterally flattened (rather than clean conical spine) superomarginal spines and because it has average less superomarginal plates on each arm. In addition, on average Astropecten platyacanthus has a central disc larger, a darker oral side and a small red point in the point of arms have. Astropecten bispinosus vs. Astropecten platyacanthus A = Astropecten platyacanthus is distinguished from Astropecten bispinosus for the superomarginal spines far from the inside edge of plates. They leave on top, on the base of them, a small bare area. B = Astropecten platyacanthus is a bit different from Astropecten bispinosus for the superomarginal spines smaller, irregularly shaped, laterally flattened (rather than clean conical spine). C = Astropecten platyacanthus is distinguished from Astropecten bispinosus for the vertical face of superomarginal plates, that are laterally covered with scales and small spines rather than nude D = Astropecten platyacanthus is a bit different from Astropecten bispinosus for the inferomarginal spines, sometime less pointed. Detail of Astropecten platyacanthus‚Äôs superomarginal spines far from the inside edge of plates Specimen large 17 cm with 35 superomarginal plates on the arm It is distinguished from Astropecten spinulosus by very different superomarginal plates: highest, defined and equipped with very big and strong superomarginal spines and they have very different plates. Secondly, the general appearance of the starfish and the colour are usually different: Astropecten spinulosus is always slenderer and dark brown with superomarginal spines brown and inferomarginal spines blue-purple. Astropecten platyacanthus reaches or exceeds 10 cm in diameter, while Astropecten spinulosus reaches at maximum just under 10 cm in diameter. Young specimens of Astropecten platyacanthus sometimes can be confused with Astropecten jonstoni for the appearance and the colour, but it is always easy to distinguish them by very different superomarginal plates and superomarginal spines.

Habitat and behaviour Starfishes of genus Astropecten live on mobile seabed (sandy, muddy or gravel seabed) and they remain largely buried under sediment during the day. During the late afternoon and the night starfishes go out to hunt mainly bivalve molluscs, which are their favourite preys. Unlike other Astropecten, this species is active and easy to find during day, especially in early morning and late afternoon. This species lives only in the Mediterranean Sea and it prefers sandy seabed at low depths as between 1 and 12 m. Description This sea star has superomarginal plates with a very short spines or without spines (usually the plates between the arms are devoid of spines). The inferomarginal plate has a short and pot external spine, arranged with great regularity, normally kept parallel to one another and rather rigid. The inferomarginal spines have dark orange colour at the base and white- yellowish towards the tip on going to draw a sort of orange outline at the base of the sea star. The overall shape is very peculiar with bigger disc than other species and arms rather court, triangular and very pointed that accentuates the classic shape of the star. The colour of aboral side is pretty clear with various nuances that can be tending towards beige, turquoise-green or grey-brown. It is the smallest species of Astropecten in the Mediterranean Sea with a maximum diameter of about 7‚Äì8 cm. This starfish has a lot of features and can be distinguished easily by its overall shape, size and colour. Rarely it is confused with very young specimens of Astropecten platyacanthus. Feeding Astropecten jonstoni This sea star is a carnivore and feeds on molluscs, which it catches with its arms and then takes to the mouth. The prey is then trapped by the long, moving prickles around the mouth cavity. References * Roberto Pillon (2009). Astropecten of the Mediterranean Sea * Koehler, R√©n√©. 1921. Faune de France.

This article therefore begins by offering a definition of the term and a brief discussion of its origins. The article thereafter is structured as a series of examples which demonstrate some of the key characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of hybrid institutions. These examples are mostly limited to environmental issues, and have been selected for their value in introducing the concept of hybrid institutions, in that they encapsulate key themes. There remains a multitude of other examples, and contributions from both environmental and other fields are welcomed and encouraged. Definition and Origins Definition The term ‚Äòinstitution‚Äô eludes precise definition, and its interpretation in academic literature varies. The dictionary definition: ‚Äòan established law, custom, or practice‚Äô is an oft-used and useful starting point. Theoretical discussions have highlighted a distinction between formal (laws, official rules, contracts, standards, procedures) and informal (shared values, behavioural norms, belief systems, codes of conduct, discourses) institutions. This distinction has emerged from what has been termed the ‚Äònew institutionalism‚Äô, which adopts a more critical approach to the study of institutions. Institutions are seen as key actors in guiding the political process, and are shaped by historical struggles, rules and procedures; rather than being merely the aggregation of individual motives. The apparent paradox at play here, that institutions both shape political processes and are themselves the product of political processes, is explored further in the examples below. The ‚Äònew institutionalism‚Äô is of value in defining what constitutes a ‚Äòhybrid institution‚Äô, as it demonstrates ‚Äúa concern with new arrangements for policy- making rather than a new look at old institutions‚Äù. Lowdnes‚Äô concept of the ‚Äòdisaggregated institution‚Äô theorises the institutionalisation of relations between governmental and non-governmental actors, providing a useful starting point for conceptualising hybrid institutions. A hybrid institution is as an institution which exists between or across the boundaries of sectors, government departments, geographic units, or combines the governance regimes of ‚Äútraditional dichotomies‚Äù such as the state and the market. They represent a new institutional pluralism, blurring the boundaries between previously distinct policy entities by creating new formal and informal institutions. A definition which includes both formal and informal institutions may be considered problematic in that almost any dialogue or cooperation could be considered an informal hybrid institution. North‚Äôs distinction between ‚Äòloosely‚Äô and ‚Äòthickly‚Äô institutionalised policy environments is of use here. Where cooperation is limited, and not enshrined within official documents or a specific policy or contract (loose, informal institutionalisation), the hybrid can be said to be weak. Within ‚Äòthickly‚Äô institutionalised environments, with contracts, rules, joint appointments etc. the hybrid is strong. This distinction is examined further in examples below. Depending on the specific context, a strong or weak hybridisation may determine the legitimacy of the institution. Institutional theorists stress the need to distinguish between institutions and organisations. Organisations are defined as ‚Äúpurposive entities‚Äù, and are ‚Äútangible ‚Äòthings‚Äô‚Äù which have remits, offices and staff‚Äù. Institutions on the other hand provide the rules, norms and settings within which organisations emerged. With hybrid institutions, such a distinction may be more difficult to draw, or perhaps not so necessary. If two existing organisations collaborate to form a joint department, bureau or agency, this new ‚Äòtangible‚Äô entity may meet the criteria of an organisation, but given its novelty and the specific conditions of its formation (being the result of an explicitly collaborative or ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô approach), it may be considered a hybrid institution. Treating ‚Äòorganisation‚Äô and ‚Äòinstitution‚Äô synonymously is perhaps less problematic within the context of hybrid institutions. While institutionalism relaxes the distinction between organizations and institutions, it is customary to see hybridity in terms of organisations. In practice, many hybrid arrangements exist on meso level as industries or organizational fields such as cleantech industry or innovations systems, as well as on system level (e.g. health policy). Further, in relational terms hybrids can be analysed in terms of single entities, dyads (group of two) or as triads (group of three). For instance global air travel consists of public, private and hybrid airline operators (single entity). The global airtravel is organized according to bilateral agreements (dyad) among public authorities, and global alliances consist of hybrid contracting among the partners in the alliances (triad)> Origins Hybrid institutions, although rarely discussed explicitly in the literature, have existed since the 1980s. The quangos established under the Thatcher Government, for instance, represent state-market institutional hybrids. Quangos also serve to demonstrate the neoliberal context within which the changes in institutional configurations are taking place (the ‚Äòrolling back‚Äô of the state and a more prominent role for the market). Moreover, the IPCC and its predecessor the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (considered below), hybrids operating between science and politics, were first established over two decades ago. The term itself was coined by administrative economist Oliver Williamson. His original use of the term to analyse modes of governance in the private sector conflates nicely with ideas of hybrid governance more generally. Williamson explored hierarchal governance within the firm, and (self)governance of single transaction markets. Williamson‚Äôs examination of the efficacy of hybrid modes of governance which combine the responsiveness, efficiency and low transaction costs of markets with the administrative and cooperative capacity within the firm resembles state-market hybrids to some extent. Type II Partnerships - An example of Public-Private Hybrid Institutions? Type II Partnerships were developed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. These partnerships exemplify a more general shift in governance practice that has been termed ‚ÄòThe Partnership Movement‚Äô, whereby ‚Äútransnational governance networks [...] bring together public, private and societal actors in an effort to institutionalise a set of ideas, practices, and norms‚Äù (emphasis added). There are clear links with network governance here, which studies the relationships between different (usually non-state) actors that work together on a particular issue or policy. The Type II Partnerships can be seen as an attempt to promote hybrid institutions between public and private actors. Whether or not these policy networks and partnerships were institutionalised, or were genuine hybrids, is debated within the literature. This debate provides a useful indirect critique of hybrid institutions. Genuine Hybridity? Although Type II Partnerships were conceived as public-private hybrids, the private sector is involved in just 20% of partnerships, and takes the lead in only 2%. Most partnerships are led by government agencies, NGOs, or existing international organisations, and the vast majority of funding comes from governments. Moreover, only 6% of partnerships involve actors from all the major categories set out: rich countries, poor countries, international organisations, NGOs, and industry. Thus, Type IIs should perhaps be considered state-non-state, rather than public-private hybrid institutions, if they can be considered hybrid institutions at all. Can Hybrid Institutions Produce Significant Changes? Because they develop out of existing institutional arrangements, hybrid institutions may be seen as reinforcing existing power structures, serving as a ‚Äúreinvention of existing institutions‚Äù, which do not help address key institutional deficits in areas with the greatest need. This is another prominent criticism in literature on partnerships. Existing organisations seek legitimacy through successful initiatives and thus target areas which already enjoy a reasonable level of institutional capacity to boost their chances of success, meaning that weaker states and marginalised areas where the need for governance solutions is greatest are left out of the process. This is rather perverse for an initiative geared toward sustainable development. The Need for Strong Hybrid Institutions Although the partnerships have been criticised, a common criticism both of the Type IIs and multilateral policy more generally is the ‚Äúminimal degree of institutionalisation‚Äù seen. This serves to promote strong hybrid institutions as a potential solution to the low ‚Äúimplementation record of [...] multilateral partnerships‚Äù. One of the more successful partnerships, The Andean Biotrade Programme, demonstrates both genuine hybridity and strongly institutionalised outcomes. The governments of 5 Andean countries, rich donor states, local and international organisations, research institutions and local communities all came together to form a Regional Biodiversity Strategy. The Strategy contains agreements on biotrade, technological development for conservation and eco-finance, a ‚Äúset of intersected [issues] that have been deadlocked at the governmental level by competing interests and power inequalities‚Äù. In the context of the Type II Partnerships, strong hybrid institutionalisation is indicative of, indeed a ‚Äúprecondition‚Äù for success. By the same token, weak, informal institutionalism which demonstrates only ‚Äúcosmetic or symbolic‚Äù arrangements does not bear positive results. Accountability Strong institutionalisation of partnerships in the form of monitoring procedures or implementation reviews, as well as helping ensure positive outcomes (legitimacy), also helps address a key requirement for institutions, accountability. New hybrid forms of governance make achieving accountability more difficult. Traditionally, (democratic) states are accountable to their voters, and private organisations to their members and shareholders. However, when numerous organisations act together, the picture is more complex. States are still ultimately acting on behalf of their citizens, but when acting in tandem with other sectors, or at the global level, the traditional ‚Äúlines of accountability‚Äù lengthen. Moreover, there is often ‚Äòexternal‚Äô accountability as well as internal, in that actors are accountable to the people in areas they affect as well as their own constituents and members. By having clear and transparent strategies, policy documents, and reporting procedures, hybrid institutions can ensure their legitimacy and accountability. Bridging Science and Politics ‚Äì The IPCC The IPCC is both a scientific and a political institution. It consists of over 2000 scientists representing 154 countries, and was ‚Äúconceived as an explicitly hybrid institution capable of producing a political consensus around scientific knowledge concerning the global climate‚Äù (emphasis added). The success of the IPCC in establishing political consensus over a very complex issue, and the failings of its predecessor, the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases, again serve as a useful indication of the principles for success in hybrid institutions. The IPCC, in its present form, is in many ways an exemplar hybrid institution. The institutional set-up is designed to achieve consensus and buy-in on a very complex issue. Each chapter must have a lead author from both the global north and south, to help ensure the report reflects the perspectives of both developed and developing countries. The final report must be unanimously agreed upon by both scientists and government representatives, resulting in a document which is ‚Äúpolicy relevant but not policy prescriptive‚Äù. As with the partnerships discussed previously, the importance of achieving both a balance of input from different sectors, and rules which shape outcomes is evident; demonstrating need for strong, genuinely hybrid institutions. Equally, some of the failings of the IPCC in its early forms, and its predecessor, demonstrate the failings of imbalanced hybrids. The quota rule which requires both north and south inputs for each chapter was introduced in response to criticism that the reports were western-centric. Moreover, Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases failed because it was too far removed from policy-making process. Without sufficient dialogue with policy-makers, the Advisory Group was viewed with suspicion for its lack of transparency and openness. In this instance the Group failed to balance between scientific and political process and thus failed as a hybrid. Some critics have argued that the IPCC produces ‚Äòwatered-down‚Äô recommendations, because of the extent of political consultation. However, as illustrated, the political dialogue is necessary and has seen remarkable success in establishing consensus. A further criticism of the IPCC is that its formation was shaped by a northern political agenda, and by framing climate change in terms of ‚Äòtolerable levels‚Äô, the moral and political issues over differential historical uses of the world‚Äôs resources were avoided. This argument reflects a wider critique of institutions as being the product of traditional power structures that perpetuate existing inequalities. Solutions that rest on hybrid institutions would be rejected by scholars such as Jordan & O‚ÄôRiordan who argue for a ‚Äúuniversal shift‚Äù in the institutional arrangements for tackling climate change, as they serve to promote western interests at the expense of the developing world at present. The Designing of Dolly - A Clone and a Hybrid? Dolly the sheep was born on 7 February 1997 as the first animal cloned from adult cells. The institutional arrangements behind this scientific feat demonstrate the increasing ‚Äúembeddedness‚Äù of political, scientific, and economic processes at work in the production of knowledge. Dolly was a product of three intimately linked institutions: The Roslin Research Institute (government funded), PPL Therapeutics (private firm), and Edinburgh University. Formally, these are all separate entities, but in reality they are intertwined and should be considered hybrid institutions. PPL, whose involvement in funding the Dolly project was driven by potential commercial applications, was originally a ‚Äòspin-off‚Äô from the Roslin Institute. The Roslin institute was initially formed to take advantage of the strong biomedical department at Edinburgh University, and over 50 PhD students from the University were involved in the Dolly project. Such hybrid arrangements are increasingly important, ‚Äúthe hybridity that these institutes represent‚Äù subverts views of a linear relationship between science and policy and demonstrates the required ‚Äúintellectual pluralism and flexibility‚Äù in public science systems . Again, the neoliberal context is evident here, with state-funded entities having to engage with the private sector and demonstrate economic worthiness to maintain legitimacy. Between Stockholm and Lima In previous examples, successful institutions are defined by strong hybridity. However, hybridity which is too strong can challenge the legitimacy of academic-scientific-private hybrids. Gulbrandsen highlights the dilemma faced by Research Institutions in their engagement with the private sector and universities. Stockholm syndrome, whereby hostages develop loyalty to their captors, is used to describe a scenario where the need for private funding jeopardises the neutrality of the research process in favour of a particular clients‚Äô perspective. Lima syndrome, whereby the captors develop an attachment to their hostages, applies where research bodies lose sight of their role in contributing to society and becoming preoccupied with esoteric academic debates. This example shows that an implied relationship between success and strong hybridity does not apply in all contexts. Indeed, weak and informally institutionalised hybrids may be necessary to retain legitimacy in some cases. Hybrid Institutions and Resource Governance One of the few uses of the term hybrid institutions in academic literature which relates explicitly to governance is German & Keeler‚Äôs discussion of hybridising governance of property regimes. Ostrom‚Äôs theory of common pool resource management highlights the value of community-created institutions in the governing of a common resource (communication, rule-making, sanctions, conflict resolution etc.). German & Keeler‚Äôs proposal is to extrapolate these successful principles and apply them across ‚Äúdiverse property regimes‚Äù, for state-owned, private and communal resources, creating hybrid institutions that combine usually distinct governance regimes. The proposal is that the combining technical and enforcement capacity of the state, the legal certainty of ownership, and the successful principles of self-organisation may help govern responses where property regimes are contentious or overlap, or where issues exist that do not respect discrete regimes of resource tenure (for example pests, weeds, or watercourse pollution). This proposal argues for hybridity not between two sectors or organisations, but between previously distinct institutional configurations associated with separate modes of governance: \\"[T]he functioning of [these] hybrid institutions depends upon the creative combination of autonomous (market), self-organising (contractual) and state regulatory (hierarchical) approaches to governance‚Äù (emphasis added) A Hybrid Future As outlined previously, hybrid institutions are becoming more prominent amid moves away from traditional government towards modes of governance more appropriate for complex issues. For instance, a great deal of political faith is being placed on hybrid institutions for tackling climate change in the form of carbon markets. Carbon markets are very much hybrid institutions in that they rely on governments to set the ‚Äúrules for participation‚Äù, such as setting the cap or baseline, monitoring, verification and, as seen in the recently announced Australian carbon tax, setting a minimum price for carbon. Only once carbon markets have been ‚Äúcrafted‚Äù by political decisions does the market aspect enter into play. The complexity and hybridity of the institutional set-up of carbon markers will be further increased if proposals to link carbon markets from different regions of the world come to fruition. Another proposal concerns the creation of a new, hybrid institution to better manage the overlaps between the UN Climate Regime and the WTO in areas such as border taxes on environmentally damaging goods, transfer of clean technologies, and trade liberalisation; institutionalising joint consideration of climate change and development. Currently these issues are addressed by the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), however there are questions as to whether this is sufficient. Even the IPCC (which avoids prescriptive policy advice) has questioned whether the CTE is ‚Äúan appropriate forum‚Äù for such discussions. Hybrid institutions then, have the potential to ‚Äúbring together expertise, [...] and broaden dialogues to overcome negotiation deadlocks‚Äù. Legitimacy and accountability of these relatively novel arrangements rests upon establishing the right degree of institutionalisation and balanced hybridity, both of which vary within different contexts.

The song was co-written by Gaye and Forest Hairston and was released on a posthumous Marvin compilation titled, The Marvin Gaye Collection 18 years later. Overview Recording The idea of the song came to Forest Hairston after seeing pictures of people tying yellow ribbons around trees for Vietnam War troops who were forced to be prisoners of war or P.O.W. Hairston hadn't finished writing the song when Marvin Gaye, who he had become friends with, happened to stop by his house. When Gaye asked Hairston what he was working on, he said he was \\"messing with a song\\" in tribute to the Vietnam troops. Gaye had mentioned to Hairston that he wanted to have a holiday song of his own and asked Hairston to play him a bit of it. Gaye stopped him mid- track and began to work more on the track with him, adding in melody and harmony parts. Gaye later took Hairston's track and went to the Motown Recording Studios in Los Angeles, otherwise known as Hitsville West, and produced the track himself. Gaye finished the recording in one take and after it was recorded on tape, returned to Hairston's apartment and slipped the tape in Hairston's recorder. When Hairston heard it, he immediately hugged Gaye complimenting his talents, to which Gaye laughed. Issues with Motown and later releases The song was supposed to be part of a Christmas-themed album by Gaye, and was given the Tamla number T-323L and scheduled for release in late 1972. But the album was never released. Gaye struggled to get the song released as a single for Vietnam troops with Motown. Eighteen years after its recording and six years after Gaye's untimely death, the song was reissued on The Marvin Gaye Collection. It also appeared as a bonus track on a later reissue of the compilation A Motown Christmas. Hairston would recall he received a royalty check from the song a few years later after the album's release. Later evaluation of the song by critics labeled it as a \\"masterpiece\\". Ever since 1990, especially during the Iraq War, Gaye's song has been played on R&B; radio stations during the Christmas season. The song was featured on the 2019 release of the posthumous Gaye album You‚Äôre The Man.

Design and development Raoul Hoffman worked to engineer the Arup S-2 with Dr. Snyder. Around 1933 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and left the company for the warmer climate of Florida where he developed his own variation, the Hoffman Flying Wing. He was replaced by Ralph Graigen to develop the next generation of the aircraft. The S-3 featured a straight leading edge with the trailing edge tapering back to the rear of the aircraft, giving it a thumbnail like appearance from the top. The aircraft featured a tall tricycle landing gear with a small tailwheel in case of over-rotation on takeoff. The fabric covered fuselage was made of welded steel tube with wooden wing ribs. The S-3 differed from the S-2 in that it included a small rudder and elevator at the rear of the fuselage, rather than placing all of the controls on the low aspect ratio wing. The fuselage was sharp-edged with a less streamlined windshield. The dihedral was inadvertently increased compared to the S-2 due to errors in the wing jigs. Operational history The S-3 was assigned the number 14147. It flew only once at St.Joe county airport with Glen Doolittle as the test pilot; the aircraft displayed poor performance. Before the second flight signs of sabotage were discovered and the aircraft was put under day and night guard by the backers. The S-3 was destroyed by arson in a hangar fire shortly afterward. Gaighen was fired and Raoul Hoffman was brought back as lead engineer for Arup for the follow-on Arup S-4 which flew successfully with the reused engine from the fire damaged S-3.

She and her team have been working since 2003 to combat Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates, and the Bumi Sehat birth centers serve many at- risk mothers. She was awarded the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year award by the CNN news network for helping thousands of low-income women in Indonesia with healthy pregnancy and birth services. Bumi Sehat In 2012, the Bumi Sehat Foundation provided 50,050 recorded incidences of patient care, educational and human services. From its beginnings as a community health and childbirth clinic in Bali, Lim took the Bumi Sehat Foundation to Aceh following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Combined, the two clinics have facilitated the birth of more than 5,000 babies. And when earthquakes struck, Lim took the project to Yogyakarta in 2006, Padang in 2008 and Haiti in 2010. Lim and the Bumi Sehat midwives are prepared to provide maternal and infant care in the middle of devastated areas with limited materials. Instead of cutting the umbilical cord, for instance, she burns it‚Äîespecially in disaster zones, because it's something she can teach midwives and doctors who have lost their instruments. Using scissors to sever the umbilical cord carries a risk of tetanus, while burning the cord mitigates risk of infection. In addition to knowing how to safely respond medically, Robin Lim and the Bumi Sehat Foundation don't have any particular religion, and honor all requests and faith traditions, aiming to help mothers feel safe and supported. Lim is an advocate for parental rights. Babies are often held by hospitals in Indonesia, until payment is made for birthing services. Parents sometimes in desperation relinquish their rights and place their babies up for adoption. Lim's Yayasan Bumi Sehat birthing sanctuaries offer free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid to anyone who needs it in Indonesia, where the average family earns the equivalent of $8 a day, and a normal hospital delivery without complications costs around $150. A Caesarean section can cost more than $1,000. Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. In turn, their lives and the lives of their babies are at risk. While some Indonesian celebrities and expatriates choose Bumi Sehat to birth their children, and they often give donations, 80% of the families served by the clinics can barely pay anything, and are helped for free. Personal life William Hemmerle and Robin Lim Lim is a U.S. citizen, with deep roots in the Philippines, the homeland of her mother. Lim is a mother of eight children of her own, and author of many books related to infant and maternal health. She became a midwife after several personal tragedies, including the death of her sister (and her baby) from complications during pregnancy, and the loss of her best friend and one of the midwives who delivered one of her own children. Lim was raised in the USA and Philippines while her father was stationed in Vietnam with the U.S. military. She studied at Santa Barbara City College. Lim and her husband, William Hemmerle, sold their home in Hawaii and moved the family to Bali. Once in Bali, Lim volunteered to help local women birth their babies in various homes. As the demand for her services grew, she decided to obtain formal midwife certification. Lim is a Certified Professional Midwife with the North American Registry of Midwives. In 2003, with help from the Balinese community and donations from friends across the globe, Lim and fellow midwife Brenda Ritchmond as well as board members; Eka Yuliani, Made Wena, and Made Sandiyasa opened the first Yayasan Bumi Sehat clinic.

Twenty more people on the ground were injured. The subsequent investigation found that an engine failure at take-off was not properly handled by the crew, which lost control of the aircraft at low altitude, without the possibility to recover before striking the ground. Accident The twin-engine Queen Air took off at around 14:10 local time from runway 13 of Manila International Airport for a flight to San Jose Airport, on the island of Mindoro. Soon after take-off, the air traffic control (ATC) instructed the crew to turn right onto a southerly heading. Moments later, the crew requested permission to land back at the airport, which was granted, but when ATC asked whether they were experiencing difficulties, there was no response from the crew. The Queen Air was observed by eyewitnesses flying at just 200 ft above the ground while making sputtering noises. It then banked left and suddenly rolled inverted, crashing into shanty houses next to the Felixberto Serrano Elementary School in the Don Bosco neighbourhood of Para√±aque. All three occupants of the Queen Air were instantly killed, along with eleven people on the ground. Twenty more people were injured. An intense post-crash fire developed, burning several houses and destroying most of the elementary school, which was unoccupied at the time. Aftermath After the crash, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) decided to ground all of Aviation Technology Innovator's aircraft. At a press conference two weeks after the crash, CAAP officials stated that poor flying technique by the pilot was a possible cause of the crash. After the engine failure the aircraft was seen to turn left towards the dead engine, when the proper procedure in these circumstances would have been for the pilot to turn the aircraft to the right instead. Investigation The investigation carried out by the Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines found that the aircraft's left engine failed at take-off due to oil starvation. The crew's \\"lack of event proficiency\\" and their failure to maintain control of the aircraft was cited as the immediate cause of the accident. Various contributing factors were listed, including inadequate training, inadequate maintenance procedures and lack of oversight by the regulating authority. The air traffic control's instruction to the crew to turn right immediately after take-off was also criticised for deviating from the airport's standard departure procedure, which would have reduced the risk of loss of control during low-altitude manoeuvres.

Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu film industries, as a single entity. They are based in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Bangalore and Mangalore, respectively. Although developed independently for a long period of time, gross exchange of film performers and technicians as well as globalisation helped to shape this new identity in Indian Cinema. The industry is regulated by the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce. The combined Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada cinema industries revenues represent 50% of Indian cinema.  History   Early beginnings during the Madras Presidency  In 1897, a European exhibitor first screened a selection of silent short films at the Victoria Public Hall in Madras. The films all featured non-fictional subjects; they were mostly photographed records of day- to-day events. In Madras (present-day Chennai), the Electric Theatre was established for the screening of silent films. It was a favourite haunt of the British community in Madras. The theatre was shut down after a few years. This building is now part of a post office complex on Anna Salai (Mount Road). The Lyric Theatre was also built in the Mount Road area. This venue boasted a variety of events, including plays in English, Western classical music concerts, and ballroom dances. Silent films were also screened as an additional attraction. Swamikannu Vincent, an employee of the South Indian Railways in Coimbatore, purchased a film projector and silent films from the Frenchman Du Pont and set up a business as film exhibitor.Pioneers In Indian Cinema ‚Äì Swamikannu Vincent . Indiaheritage.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-29. He erected tents for screening films. His tent cinema became popular and he travelled throughout the state with his mobile unit. In later years, he produced talkies and also built a cinema in Coimbatore. To celebrate the event of King George V's visit in 1909, a grand exhibition was organised in Madras. Its major attraction was the screening of short films accompanied by sound. A British company imported a Crone megaphone, made up of a film projector to which a gramophone with a disc containing prerecorded sound was linked, and both were run in unison, producing picture and sound simultaneously. However, there was no synched dialogue. Raghupathy Venkaiah Naidu, a successful photographer, took over the equipment after the exhibition and set up a tent cinema near the Madras High Court. R. Venkaiah, flush with funds, in 1912 built a permanent cinema in the Mount Road area named Gaiety Theatre. It was the first in Madras to screen films on a full-time basis. The theatre later closed for commercial developments. Swamikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of South India in Coimbatore, introduced the concept of \\"Tent Cinema\\" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first of its kind was established in Madras, called \\"Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone\\". This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors. Full-fledged film studios were built in Salem (Modern Theatres Studio) and Coimbatore (Central Studios, Neptune, and Pakshiraja). Chennai became the hub of studio activity with two more movie studios built in Chennai, Vijaya Vauhini Studios and Gemini Studios. Thus, with the undivided Madras Presidency, being the Capital to most of South India, Chennai became the center for South Indian language films. AVM studios in Chennai, the oldest surviving studio in India  First South Indian films  The first Madras production was Keechaka Vadham (The Destruction of Keechaka), produced and directed by R. Nataraja, who established the India Film Company Limited. During the 1920s, silent Tamil language films were shot at makeshift locations in and around Chennai, and for technical processing, they were sent to Pune or Calcutta. Later, some films featuring M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar were shot in those cities as well. Telugu artists became active with the production of Bhisma Pratighna, a silent film, in 1921. The film was directed by Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu and his son R. S. Prakash. The two, along with Yaragudipati Varada Rao, would go on to produce and direct dozens of films throughout the decade, casting theater actors in major roles. They established a long-lasting precedent of focusing exclusively on religious themes; Nandanar,Land Marks in Tamil Cinema Gajendra Moksham, and Matsyavatar, three of their most famous productions, centered on religious figures, parables, and morals.1916‚Äì1936 Bhakta Prahlada, a 1932 Telugu talkie film directed by H. M. Reddy In 1931, the first Tamil silent film, Keechaka Vadham, was made by R. Nataraja Mudaliar in 1918. The first talking motion picture, Kalidas, was a multilingual and was released on 31 October 1931, less than seven months after India's first talking motion picture Alam Ara. Popularly known as talkies, films with sound quickly grew in number and popularity. In 1934, the industry saw its first major commercial success with Lavakusa. Directed by C. Pullaiah and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani in lead roles, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theaters and thrust the young film industry into mainstream culture. During the same time, the first Kannada talkie, Sati Sulochana,\\"First film to talk in Kannada\\" article in The Hindu appeared in theatres, followed by Bhakta Dhruva (aka Dhruva Kumar). Both Sati Sulochana and Bhakta Dhruva were major successes. But prospective filmmakers in Karnataka were handicapped by the lack of studios and technical crews. Sati Sulochana was shot in Kolhapur at the Chatrapathi studio; most filming, sound recording, and post- production was done in Madras. It was difficult, as well, to find financial backing for new film projects in the region; thus, very few movies in Kannada were released during the early years of Indian sound cinema. The first talkie in Malayalam was Balan, released in 1938. It was directed by S. Nottani with a screenplay and songs written by Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai. Malayalam films continued to be made mainly by Tamil producers until 1947, when the first major film studio, Udaya, was established in Alleppey, Kerala by Kunchacko, who earned fame as a film producer and director.  Social influences and superstars  The Madras presidency was divided into linguistic States, known today as Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The division marked the beginning of a new era in South Indian cinema. Cinema was celebrated regionally and exclusively in the language of the respective State. By 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes. One such film, Jeevitha Nouka (1951), was a musical drama which spoke about the problems in a joint family. Earlier, dozens of 'social films', notably Prema Vijayam, Vandemataram and Maala Pilla, have been released in Telugu. Touching on societal problems like the status of Untouchables and the practice of giving dowry, Telugu films increasingly focused on contemporary living: 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 had social themes. Attempts made by some Congress leaders in Tamil Nadu to use stars of Tamil cinema were limited since this media remained inaccessible to the rural population, who were in the majority. The politicizing of movies by the Congress virtually stopped soon after Indian Independence in 1947.Sarah, Dickey (1993). \\"The Politics of Adulation: Cinema and the Production of Politicians in South India\\". The Journal of Asian Studies 52 (2): 340‚Äì372. With the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1950s Dravidian politicians could implement movies as a major political organ. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was the first ‚Äî and at the time the only ‚Äî party to take advantage of visual movie media. Actors and writers of guerrilla theater, who were inspired by the ideologies of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, brought the philosophies of Tamil nationalism and anti-Brahminism to celluloid media.Hardgrave, Jr, Robert L (March 1973). \\"Politics and the Film in Tamilnadu: The Stars and the DMK\\". Asian Survey (JSTOR) 13 (3): 288‚Äì305 The movies not only made direct references to the independent Dravida Nadu that its leaders preached for but also at many times displayed party symbols within the movie. When the DMK began using cinema for political purposes and actors like MGR and S. S. Rajendran rode into politics on their popularity as actors, Tamil cinema began to be noticed by academics, S.S.Rajendran, as a film actor, became the first elected 'Member of legislative assembly in the industry from Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, Tamil film Chandralekha crossed all language borders. It was the time, when M. G. Ramachandran became one of the most remembered actors of India. His popularity enabled him to found a political party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which is regularly part of the Government of Tamil Nadu. He posthumously won Bharat Ratna. The time was hailed as \\"the period of giants\\" in Malayalam film industry, due to the work of film stars Sathyan and Prem Nazir. Nazir catapulted to the row of the finest actors of India with the film Iruttinte Athmavu (1967). Playing a demented youth ‚Äî Velayadhan, Nazir discovered his prowess as a dramatic actor of great intensity. Many critics have evaluated this role as his masterpiece, and as one of the finest onscreen performances ever. He holds the record for having acted in the most leading roles ‚Äì about 700 films. Another record is for the most enduring screen team along with actress Sheela. They played opposite each other in 130 movies. It was also the time when Rajkumar shot to fame. Rajkumar acted in more than 200 movies who also won National Awards for singing songs like \\"Naadamaya Ee Lokavella\\" from the movie Jeevana Chaitra. His film Bangaaradha Manushya created a record at the box office for successfully running in the main theaters for more than two continuous years. He later spearheaded the Kannada language movement, followed by millions of his fans, however the star remained away from politics.

The 2001 Census recorded the parish's population as 100. Crowell village is a spring line settlement at the source of a stream called the Pleck at the foot of the Chiltern Hills escarpment. The toponym \\"Crowell\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"crow's spring\\" or \\"crow's stream\\". Crowell is a strip parish about long on a northwest ‚Äì southeast axis and less than wide at its widest point. The northwest part of the strip is low-lying land in the Vale of Oxford about above sea level; the southeast part of the strip is in the Chilterns and rises to above sea level. The southeastern part of the parish is bounded on three sides by Buckinghamshire. Archaeology The Lower Icknield Way forms the low-lying northwestern boundary of the parish and The Ridgeway traverses the upland southeastern part. An earthwork about long on a north ‚Äì south axis ascends the Chiltern escarpment in Crowellhill Wood. Manor The Domesday Book records that before the Norman conquest of England one Alwin held the manors of Crowell and Emmington but by 1086 the Norman knight William Peverel held both estates. Crowell passed to Peverel's son-in-law Richard de Redvers (d. 1107) and then descended with his heirs the Earls of Devon until at least 1375. By 1376 it was effectively part of the Honour of Wallingford, which in 1540 became part of the Honour of Ewelme. Crowell remained part of the latter honour until the 18th century. Parish church The Church of England parish church of the Nativity of the Bless√©d Virgin Mary is a small flint building. The church existed by the middle of the 12th century and the blocked-up Norman north doorway survives from this time. In the 13th century the chancel arch was rebuilt and the present south doorway was added. In the 14th century the chancel was rebuilt, made taller than the nave and given Decorated Gothic windows. The internal and external fabric of the building were repaired and renewed several times in the 17th and 18th centuries and notably in 1835‚Äì39 by one Richard Clark of Wallingford, whose work included renewal of the box pews and three-decker pulpit. In 1878 the church was largely rebuilt to designs by the architects H.J. Tollit and Edwin Dolby. They re-used the Norman north doorway, 13th-century south doorway, 14th-century piscina, sedilia and chancel arch responds and a low-side window in the chancel. There had been a wooden west tower but Tollit and Dolby replaced this with a stone bellcote. They also added a vestry on the north side of the church. The church is now part of the Benefice of Chinnor, Sydenham, Aston Rowant & Crowell.

Economic and social history Flint cottages in Crowell The parish originally farmed under an open field system. There had been several enclosures by agreement by the middle of the 17th century, including most of the land on Crowell Hill. The Reverend John Stopes, Rector of Crowell (d. 1668), bequeathed 4 acres of land whose income would be used to assist the poor of the parish. By the 1880s 64 percent of Crowell's land had been enclosed: . In 1844 Crowell's remaining open fields were called Great Lob, Little Lob, Great Berrylands and Little Berrylands. Crowell's inclosure act was not passed until the 1880s and the award was made in 1882, making it the last inclosure act for Oxfordshire. This may be because so little land remained to be enclosed: a total of only of arable land and meadow. Ellwood House is a mid-16th-century timber-framed farmhouse with a 17th-century extension and facade and some 18th-century features. Thomas Ellwood (1639‚Äì1713), who became a Quaker religious writer and a friend of John Milton, was born here. Crowell had a public house by 1753 and a map of 1797 shows one on the same site as the current village pub. In 1859 a fire destroyed several houses in the village and made eight families homeless. The present pub, originally called the Catherine Wheel, seems to have been built shortly after this fire. In 1869‚Äì72 the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway was built through the parish, passing southeast of the village. In 1883 the Great Western Railway took over the line and in 1906 the company opened , south of Crowell. In 1957 British Railways withdrew passenger services from the line and closed the section between and that included Kingston.

Recording For the duration of Motown Records' tenure in its native Detroit, Berry Gordy's father, Berry Gordy, Sr., otherwise known as \\"Pops\\", was one of the overseers of his son's label and was one of many to guide its many artists, most of which became famous following the release of successful records. Among those who he helped mentor were Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder. At one point, Gaye was Gordy's son-in-law after he married his daughter Anna. When Gordy Sr. died that October, his son asked longtime Motown songwriters Marilyn McLeod and Pam Sawyer to compose a song in tribute to him and also began to produce a full-length album with other artists. For the title track, Ross, Gaye, Robinson and Wonder were called in to record the song. Ross, Gaye and Robinson recorded the track together in Motown's L.A. studios, but Wonder, who was busy at work on a mostly instrumental piece to a soundtrack for the movie, later called Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants, recorded his part separate from the rest of the trio. His voice was later dubbed. Ross and Gaye were sparked from the recording of the song that they agreed to add vocals to another McLeod/Sawyer composition, the lite funk- laden, socially conscious \\"I'll Keep My Light in My Window\\", marking their first studio duet since the Diana & Marvin sessions of 1972. Unlike the 1972 sessions, Gaye and Ross recorded the duet together. Reception Billboard listed the single in its Top Single Picks, meaning that the magazine predicted that the single would reach the top 30 on the Hot 100. The reviewer wrote, \\"Outstanding vocal performances by these four premiere singers highlights this song written for Berry Gordy Sr.'s 90th birthday. However, rather the lyric content leaves something to be desired and takes away from the glittering vocals, especially Stevie Wonder's.\\" J. Randy Taraborrelli, writing in Diana Ross: A Biography, commented, \\"It would seem that a song such as 'Pops, We Love You,' featuring Motown's biggest superstars, couldn't miss. But, while Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder all turned in strong performances, this tribute to Berry Gordy's father was just too much of a novelty to be taken seriously.\\" David Ritz, writing in Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, said that Gaye, Wonder, Robinson, and Ross formed \\"a spirited quartet\\" and that the song was \\"infectious\\", noting that Gaye had \\"boundless love\\" for Pops Gordy. Gaye was quoted as saying, \\"'If Pops had been my father instead of Berry's, ... maybe I could have achieved as much as Berry.'\\" Release The song was issued as a single in December 1978, just before the Christmas season. The 7-inch and 12-inch releases of the single had the song's 45rpm shaped around a red heart. The song was a mild hit upon its release reaching as high as number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979, while reaching number 66 on the UK Singles chart. It fared better on the U.S. R&B; charts, peaking at number 26. The disco version and the single version of the song were placed on the final track listing of the Pops, We Love You album. Later in 1979, several department stores in Los Angeles used \\"Pops, We Love You\\" as the theme song of their promotional campaign for Father's Day.

The trophy winners at a local rose show (ARS affiliated rose society) History United Kingdom Initially in the UK roses were exhibited in general flower shows such as those run by the Royal Horticultural Society. Judges were appointed by whoever sponsored the show, and were not necessarily rosarians themselves. The first Grand National specialty rose show was held July 1, 1858, in St. James Hall, London. It was organized by S. Reynolds Hole, Dean of Rochester Cathedral and a prominent rosarian, Thomas Rivers, a nurseryman and publisher of the first catalog of roses (1834) in the UK, Charles Turner, a rosarian, and William Paul, a writer and nurseryman. Exhibitors were divided into three classes: nurserymen, amateur rosarians with hired gardeners, and amateur rosarians without hired gardeners (avid exhibitors included many working-class men and farmers). Prizes were 36 silver cups engraved with roses. John Edwards was in charge of setting up the show, which entailed clearing away the chairs and benches from the previous night‚Äôs concert, and constructing tables for the exhibits. Subscription fee for exhibitors was 5 pounds, admission for the general public was 1 shilling. More than 2000 people attended the first Grand National Rose-Show. Music was provided by a brass band, which proved to be too loud for the venue. Exhibition-form roses were exhibited as cut specimens grouped in a box, and the entire collection was judged on the quality of the individual specimens and on the composition of the whole. Duplicate cultivars were not allowed. Collections were to be in multiples of 6, up to 72 for nurserymen. Most exhibitors put their rose stems in vases or bottles nestled in moss inside a box of some kind, but some exhibitors inserted their cut stems into potatoes in straw to keep the roses hydrated. Wiring of stems and flowers was allowed ‚Äì Tea roses were popular at that time, and the flowers of many Tea roses do not stand upright on their own. Garden roses, those not possessing exhibition form, were exhibited in bouquets. Judges worked in teams of three. The second Grand National Rose-Show was held June 23, 1859, in the Hanover Square Rooms. In addition to cut roses in boxes, bouquets, and baskets, potted roses were exhibited. Boxes for the cut rose collections were required to be standardized, with metal vases embedded in moss ‚Äì no potatoes or straw or beer bottles. The boxes were required to have a cover for transporting the roses to the show. Exhibitors travelled by either train or horse-drawn vans at the time, and roses needed a sturdy box in transportation. Box with cover was only 14\\" tall, so the specimens inside the box had to be shorter than that. Music was provided by a strings and reeds band instead of brass. After this second show, it was decided that London did not provide rooms big enough for the crowds attending the rose show. Accordingly, the third Grand National Rose-Show was held July 12, 1860, in the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. 16,000 people attended. In 1861, the Royal Horticultural Society hosted the Fourth Grand National Rose-Show in Kensington on July 10. The rose show was held here every year through 1877. At that time the newly formed National Rose Society (founded 1876) took over the Grand National Rose-Show. The Very Reverend Reynolds Hole was the first president of the (Royal) National Rose Society. The (Royal) National Rose Society set the standards for exhibition and judging of roses for the Grand National Rose-Show and for rose shows sponsored by affiliated local rose societies. United States The American Rose Society was founded in 1892. Initially, in contrast to the (Royal) National Rose Society in Great Britain, ARS membership was limited to professional nurserymen and florists. Amateur rosarians formed local rose societies, such as Portland (Oregon) in 1889, and Tacoma (Washington State) and Syracuse (New York State) in 1911. Tacoma had hosted rose shows as early as 1895. The first ARS sponsored rose show was held in March 1900, in New York City. At that time the ARS was a trade organization of professional nurserymen and florists. A second show, allowing amateurs, was held that June. Roses were displayed as 25 stems or more of the same variety. Single-stem exhibits became standard by about 1938. Show classes were divided by color. Judging was left to the tastes and inclinations of individual judges up until standards started to be developed in the 1940s. The first ARS judging school was held in 1950, and the first published judging standards appeared in 1959. The first edition of the current Guidelines for Judging Roses was published in 1971. The ARS first allowed amateur rosarians and local societies to join as affiliates in 1914. The Syracuse Rose Society, with 300 members, was the first local rose society to join the ARS, in May 1914. Since 1974, the American Rose Society's headquarters and gardens have been located at the American Rose Center in Shreveport, Louisiana. World Federation of Rose Societies The World Federation of Rose Societies is an organization of national rose societies. It facilitates a world conference with a rose exhibition every three years, sponsored by a national society. It was founded in 1968. Founding member national societies were Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Romania, South Africa, Great Britain and the US. Canada, India, Japan and Switzerland joined at the first conference in 1971 in New Zealand. Exhibitors bring roses from all over the world to exhibit at the World Conferences. Exhibition and judging standards The American Rose Society sets guidelines and standards for rose shows in the US (and for Canadian rose societies affiliated with the ARS) and is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for Roses by appointment of the International Society for Horticultural Science. The Rose Society UK sets the guidelines and standards and organises rose shows in the UK. Many Canadian and Australian rose societies were affiliated with the RNRS in addition to their own national societies. Rose shows using ARS guidelines use cultivar classifications assigned by the ARS, for instance Hybrid Tea or Gallica. The ARS also assigns one of 18 official color classes to cultivars, for instance Light Yellow, Medium Yellow, Deep Yellow, and Yellow Blend. There is no color class for blue. Rose shows are hosted by local societies and may be organized as a local show, an ARS District show, or an ARS National show. Local shows generally require no registration or entry fees, while District and National shows do. All three levels of rose show generally offer three divisions: Challenge Classes, Horticulture, and Arrangements. Other divisions may be offered, for instance Rose Photography or Rose Crafts. Rose-themed Quilts have been included at rose shows. The Challenge Classes available vary between the local, District, and National levels. The Horticulture division of a rose show consists of (usually) single specimens of roses ‚Äì one 'Peace' rose in a vase, for instance. A few Horticulture classes call for multiple specimens, for instance 3 Stems Hybrid Tea, One Variety. In US shows, the Horticulture classes can be organized either alphabetically by name, i.e. 'Peace' would be exhibited under Hybrid Teas N-R; or by ARS color classes, i.e. 'Peace' would be exhibited under Hybrid Tea Yellow Blends. In some larger shows, popular varieties with many entries, such as 'Peace', may get their own class. The Challenge Classes division imposes special criteria on the exhibit, for instance Five Floribunda Sprays, Five Varieties, judged on both individual bloom quality and composition of the whole. There are five kinds of Challenge classes: multiple stems of multiple varieties of the same class; multiple stems of one variety; multiple stems of multiple classes; bloom progression (3 stems: bud, exhibition bloom, and open bloom with stamens showing); and English-style box (6 roses). Other popular Challenge classes include Most Fragrant, Rose in a Photo Frame, Rose in a Bowl, and Artist's Palette (5 roses, different colors). The Arrangements division consists of floral arrangements in which roses predominate. The ARS offers a series of named Challenge classes, ranging in size from a single Grandiflora in an \\"appropriate\\" container, to 5 Old Garden roses in separate containers, to 6 All-American Rose Selection winners in separate containers, to 12 Miniature roses in a clear container. Rose shows using ARS guidelines and standards are judged by ARS-accredited judges working in teams of three. Accreditation requires experience exhibiting, working as a show clerk, attending a judging school, and passing an exam and an apprenticeship. Judging schools in the US are held by the ARS Districts and are required to use the ARS-published Guidelines for Judging Roses as the text. The exam is a standardized national exam. Judges are required to audit the judging school every three years. The ARS has established standard certificates for awards at local society rose shows, for instance Queen, King, Princess; Classic Shrub, Modern Shrub. Local societies are free to use any or all of these certificates, plus other categories as desired. Various publications are used by exhibitors to enter their roses in the right show category. The ARS publishes the Handbook for Selecting Roses, mailed to members annually, which lists most roses in commerce in North America and gives the official Exhibition Name, color class, petal count, year of introduction, and classification. The Combined Rose List is published annually and is used by exhibitors and judges as a reference for official cultivar names and unofficial synonyms, color category and classification, and year of introduction. It includes all roses known to be in commerce worldwide. The Guidelines for Judging Roses is published by the ARS and gives the standards by which roses are to be judged: Form, Color, Substance, Stem and Foliage, Balance and Proportion, and Size. Exhibition form Rose flowers come in different forms. Flowers may be cupped, globular, flat, imbricated (like a camellia) or high-centered. Exhibition flower form is defined by the ARS as a high-centered flower with a circular outline and petals that spiral outwards from the center in a symmetrical manner. In profile, the flower should form a cone. Most cultivars are exhibited at a stage from one half to three quarters open ‚Äì enough to show the pointed center, with no stamens showing. Exhibition form roses must also produce long stems. Some rose cultivars are capable of producing flowers of exhibition form, while many others are not. These latter cultivars may be referred to as ‚Äògarden‚Äô or ‚Äòdecorative‚Äô roses. A few cultivars may produce exhibition form flowers under certain weather conditions but not others. Rose shows may have special classes for the decorative roses separate from the exhibition roses. Queen of Show, the highest award, is generally reserved for roses of exhibition form. In 19th century rose shows, exhibition cultivars were mostly Hybrid Perpetuals and Teas. These have now fallen out of favor as exhibition roses and are relegated to separate classes for Old Garden Roses, not eligible for Queen of Show. Hybrid tea roses were developed early in the 20th century, with even higher-centered flowers and more symmetrical spiralling than the Hybrid Perpetuals were capable of producing, and quickly became the favored exhibition roses. Other exhibition types Roses in the US are also shown at garden club shows and county fairs. These shows are generally not judged by ARS-accredited judges or by ARS judging standards. The National Council of State Garden Clubs trains and certifies judges for these shows, including sections on the judging of roses. ARS-affiliated local rose societies may host rose shows that do not use the ARS guidelines or standards; these are often called Rose Displays and often are not judged at all, merely admired. Heritage rose groups, independent of the ARS, host non-judged Celebrations of Old Roses, as well as garden tours.

He won a reputation as a strong player based on his performance in the 1908 Penn game.(\\"Word was received in Ann Arbor Wednesday that Riley, the big guard who performed so well for Michigan in the 1908 Pennsy game, expected to report for preliminary training next week.\\") He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1910, was admitted to the Michigan Bar in September 1910, and became associated with the firm of Rushton & Riley in Escanaba, Michigan. Coaching career Riley was the assistant coach of the University of Maine's football team in 1910. That year, Maine tied for the Maine Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) championship. In November 1911, Maine head coach Edgar Wingard announced that he would not act as head coach of the football any longer and would instead give all of his time to the general direction of athletics. On November 21, 1911, the University of Maine Athletic Association announced that Riley had been hired as the new head football coach.(\\"The University of Maine Athletic Association has obtained the services of Thomas J.

However, once Spaniards arrived and claimed the area for Spain, a process known as mestizaje occurred, in which Spaniards and Native Americans had mestizo children who had both Spanish and indigenous blood. Texas was ruled by Spain as part of its New Spain territory from 1520, when Spaniards first arrived in Mexico in 1520, until Texas won independence from Mexico in 1836, which led to the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848). In 1830, the Mexican population fell to 20 percent and in 1840 down to 10 percent. When Spanish rule in Texas ended, Mexicans in Texas numbered 5,000. In 1850 over 14,000 Texas residents had Mexican origin.\\"Mexican Americans.\\" Handbook of Texas. Retrieved on December 11, 2011. John E. Farley. 2010. Majority-Minority Relations.

The Hispanic population contributes to Texas having a younger population than the American average, because Hispanic births have outnumbered non-Hispanic white births since the early 1990s. In 2007, for the first time since the early nineteenth century, Hispanics accounted for more than half of all births (50.2%), while non-Hispanic whites accounted for just 34%. Lynching of Mexican-Americans in Texas From 1848 to 1928 there were hundreds of lynchings of Mexican-Americans across the American West. Many of these lynchings occurred in Texas against people of Mexican descent. One such case was the case of Paulino Serda of Edinburg,Texas, a city in south Texas. Paulino Serda was killed by Texas Rangers on his ranch in 1915 during questioning. In September of that same year, Texas Rangers encountered Jesus Bazan and Antonio Longoria riding their horses near their ranch in Edinburg, Texas. Even though they had committed no crimes, the Texas Rangers shot and killed the two men on the assumption that were Mexican bandit sympathizers; they left their bodies where they were shot to be found by locals two days later. Many more Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans living in the Texas- Mexico border were killed during this period, now designated as La Matanza.

The first film to be produced by actress Neetu Chandra. The film introduces new actors Ajay Kumar, Deepak Singh and Kranti Prakash Jha in lead roles along with critically acclaimed actor Pankaj Jha and Ashish Vidyarthi. In 2010 Neetu Chandra had expressed a hope that it would move beyond the limited release that is common for Bhojpuri films and instead be seen throughout India and perhaps also abroad. She intends that the film would employ multilingual dialogue - Bhojpuri, English, Telugu and Hindi - as well as being dubbed into Tamil and Marathi in order to extend its appeal. She believ that \\"With Deswa, we would be redefining the very face of Bhojpuri cinema.\\" Deswa is the first Bhojpuri film in 50 years to get selected at Indian Panorama section of International Film Festival of India, which was enough to support the vision of Neetu Chandra. Deswa was also invited by IIM - A and had selection at South Asian Film Festival, Habitat World Film Festival, Montage Film Festival, International Film Festival of Fiji, Bhojpuri Film Festival and latest was International Film Festival of South Asia (IFFSA), Toronto, Canada and it is still being invited at several National and International Film Festivals. This film is a part of inaugural Bhojpuri Film Festival 2017 at Ahiri Fort Auditorium Delhi. Director Nitin Chandra is also taking part in this festival. The film was screened in Patna, Bihar on 20 November 2011. This was attended by the cast and by state luminaries such as Nitish Kumar, the Chief Minister of the state. It received favourable reviews from critics at film festivals, such as the International Film Festival of India in Goa. It was also screened in South Asian Film Festival of India, Montage Film Festival, Habitat World Film Festival and International Film Festival of Fiji. The Hindi-language variant of this film was released in October 2015 under the name Once Upon A Time In Bihar. Plot  The film deals with contemporary issues affecting youths. It begins in 2005 with a student protest during the corrupt administration, intended to free the characters played by Ajay Kumar and Deepak Singh. The film goes in a flashback of these two prisoners. Singh is a temporary Government teacher who twice passed the written entrance examination for the Indian Police Service but was not selected for employment. Kumar is a brilliant student but from a poor family, which meant that he could not afford the 200,000 bribe that was necessary in order to secure a job. He has a friend who is of a lower caste, which adds to his woes because the relationship caused friction with both his older brother and society generally. While Kumar needs money for the bribe and to pay a dowry on the marriage of his sister, his friend needs finance to start a roadside tea stall and so escape the need to continue working for his cruel employer. The young men plan the most unusual idea and, as the destiny would have, fail. Deswa is a 2-hour 10-minute film which will engage you through its picturesque cinematography, songs by the great Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan, Sharda Sinha, Bharat Sharma Vyas, Mika, Swanand Kirkire and a new singer from Bihar, Prabhakar Pandey and edge-of-the-seat thrilling scenes. Cast *Ajay Kumar *Deepak Singh *Kranti Prakash Jha *Arti Puri *Neetu Chandra (Special Appearance in a folk dance choreographed by Ganesh Acharya.) Soundtrack  The soundtrack was released on the T-Series label and includes songs performed by singers such as Sonu Nigam, Sharda Sinha, Shreya Ghoshal, Mika and Sunidhi Chauhan. The music director is Ashutosh Singh. Production The film was filmed mostly in Bihar. Locations included Buxar district, Patna and Andhra Pradesh. Reception The film received good response at the time of token release in 5 theatres. It was mainly released to make the film eligible for National Film Awards. A change in the screening times caused the audience numbers to rise. Nitin Chandra commented that \\"she is confident that the film would pick up gradually, although, apart from Neetu's dance number, it does not have any popular star, but great actors. The first day response during the trial screening was not that great probably because people prefer not too catch the morning show during winter\\". The whole idea is to release the film in both Hindi and Bhojpuri versions was taken later. The film also screened at the International Film Festival of India in Goa where it received favourable reviews from critics. Despite an international presence of a Bhojpuri film, no one from the Bihar or film fraternity has come forward to get this film released.

Oriani (July 19, 1920 ‚Äì August 11, 2015) was an El Salvador-born American chemical engineer and metallurgist who was instrumental in the study of the effects of hydrogen in metal. He also made significant contributions to the field of cold fusion. Biography Oriani was born in El Salvador in 1920, to a mother of Spanish descent and a father of Italian descent. The family emigrated to the US when he was 9 years old, and lived in Brooklyn, New York with his parents, brother Ernest and sister Elena. In 1943, Oriani graduated from the College of the City of New York with a degree in chemical engineering. Although he was at the top of his class, Oriani had difficulty finding work because although his father had lived in Salvador for a number of years, he never pursued Salvadoran citizenship. Because of this, Oriani‚Äôs passport was Italian, marking him as an \\"enemy alien.\\" However, one of Oriani‚Äôs professors helped him secure a position at the Bakelite Corporation Research Laboratory, where he worked on the study of adhesion and on the development of a military adhesive, for which he was granted a patent. This work kept him from induction into the Army, and in 1948 he earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Princeton University. Oriani then went to the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, where as a Research Associate he studied, among other topics, the thermodynamics of solid metallic solutions, the order-disorder reaction in superlattice systems, nuclear magnetic measurements of hydrogen in metals, and Knight Shift measurements in liquid alloys. As a sideline, Oriani independently verified the high pressure technique developed at the GE Laboratory for the synthesis of a diamond. After ten years at GE, Oriani moved on to U.S. Steel's Bain Laboratory for Fundamental Research in which he served as Assistant Director and researcher on irreversible thermodynamics applied to metallurgy, nucleation, thermomigration, electromigration, impact adhesion, and hydrogen embrittlement of steel. In 1980 he retired from U.S. Steel and was invited to serve at the University of Minnesota as Professor and Director of a newly established Corrosion Research Center. He retired in 1999, but maintained an office and conducted research experiments there until 2014. Oriani published over 200 articles in peer-reviewed journals during his long career. His early work focused on the thermodynamics of phase changes in metals and metal solutions, while his later work at U.S. Steel gained him worldwide respect for his advancements in the field of hydrogen embrittlement. Oriani's theory on the diffusion of hydrogen through metal and its tendency to embrittle metals by concentrating at certain defects became the first to reconcile the widely scattered observations and interpretations of hydrogen embrittlement. The work served as a foundation for subsequent researchers who expanded and refined Oriani's original theory, leading to a deep understanding of how one of the mankind's most important structural materials can fail catastrophically. While serving as the director for the Corrosion Institute at the University of Minnesota, Oriani pioneered the use of the Kelvin probe to study corrosion of metals in a wide range of environments, including corrosion induced by humidity. In 1989, Oriani‚Äôs work expanded to include the growing and controversial field of cold fusion. In 1990, barely a year after the original announcement of excess energy in an electrochemical cell by Pons and Fleischmann, Oriani corroborated this finding using a sophisticated calorimetric technique. Oriani then focused on the nuclear origins of the excess energy, detecting and quantifying the emission of nuclear particles by electrochemical reactions. Oriani has conducted meaningful and successful collaborations with many researchers and theorists in the field, including John Fisher and Japan‚Äôs Tadahiko Mizuno. He has published at least nine papers describing nuclear reactions unexplained by the present state of scientific knowledge, in spite of editorial bias against such revolutionary findings. If cold fusion becomes a reality, Oriani says, \\"It would open up a new area of nuclear physics entirely. It would augment nuclear physics as we understand it today.\\" (November/December 2010, Issue 94, Infinite Energy) An avid and self- taught musician, playing the viola and piano, he met his wife Constance at a musical group in New York.

Description and history The former Emery School building is located south of Biddeford's main business district, on a lot bounded by Hill, Birch, and Summer Streets. It is a two-story brick structure, trimmed in cast stone and granite, facing south toward Birch Street, separated by a paved parking area. The main facade is symmetrically arranged, nine bays wide, with two slightly-projecting entrance pavilions set one bay in from the ends. These pavilions are framed by rusticated brick pilasters with a stone cartouche at the top of the second floor. The entrances are set in cast stone surrounds consisting of pilasters supporting a modillioned cornice supported by scrolled brackets. Belt courses of stone demarcate the floors, and the cornice of the main hipped roof is of pressed metal.Beard, Christine (2011); NRHP nomination for Emery School (available by requested from the Maine SHPO) The Emery School was built in 1912-13 as part of a drive by the city to modernize its school facilities. Designed in the Colonial Revival style by the Portland firm of Miller & Mayo, it adhered to guidelines published by the state in 1904 for the required properties of elementary school buildings, which included detailed prescriptions for the use of materials and layout and size of classrooms, and replaced four smaller elementary schools. The school was used by the city until 1993, and served until 2007 as a childhood development center operated by a local Catholic church. The building has since been converted into residences.

Thought Islamists Sidaoui draws attention to the notion that many fanatical Islamists have degrees in sciences; in fact, the September 11, 2001 attacks were committed by men who had completed studies in natural sciences. He explains: \\"Despite the lack of a comprehensive study on the occupational origin of the leadership of Islamist movements in the Arab world, we can see an almost total domination of scientific careers. It seems that the number of engineers, doctors, physicists, etc., acting on behalf of Islam, is considerable. This thesis is confirmed by the success of Islamists in the elections of scientific advice in the faculties of sciences. This same success is difficult if not impossible in the faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences.\\". After the fall of Arab dictators in the Arab Spring, Sidaoui said that the first winners of the revolutions are Islamists in view of their capacity of mobilization and organization. In addition, he noted that the Islamists have the overwhelming support of the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf, the petrodollars, but also the United States, that accept a moderate Islam in the Arab world (as in Turkey). Saudi Wahhabism According to Riadh Sidaoui, habitual use of the term Wahhabism is scientifically false, and it should be substituted with the concept of Saudi Wahhabism,[Le wahhabisme saoudien est le plus dangereux des courants religieux (ÿßŸÑŸàŸáÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸäÿ© ÿ£ÿÆÿ∑ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜŸäÿ©), Alkhabar al ousboui, Alg√©ria, 30 August 2010] an Islamic doctrine which is based on the historical alliance between the political and financial power represented by Ibn Saud and the religious authority represented by Abdul Al-Wahhab.

The new regime became known for its brutality, and today Idi Amin is one of history's most notorious dictators. As violence spread through the country and civil war erupted, Kayongo and his family became refugees in Kenya. He later immigrated to America to attend university. Today, he is a successful entrepreneur and human rights innovator.''

He had never seen so much soap for one person. After a few days, he began to wonder what happened to the partially used soap that disappeared from his room each day and discovered that it was just thrown away.TEDxTalks. \\"Simple Solutions for Colossal Problems  Derreck Kayongo.\\" YouTube.

Inspired by his experiences as a refugee in Kenya, and knowing that in-crisis communities are often without any soap at all, Kayongo and his wife Sarah eventually formed Global Soap, a life-changing international aid organization that collected discarded soap from hotels, reprocessed it and distributed it to vulnerable populations worldwide. In 2015, Kayongo stepped down when Global Soap joined forces with Clean the World, a global health leader in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and sustainability. Although Global Soap has ceased operations, Clean the World's foundation continues to develop programs to support children and their families in at-risk communities around the world and has contributed towards a 60% reduction in the death rate of children under the age of 5 due to hygiene-related illnesses.

It was designed and is produced in the Czech Republic. Design and development The Sirius programme was announced early in 2007 and an unflown prototype or mock- up appeared at Aero '07 that year. Development continued into 2010 before it was ready for production. The TL-3000 is a mostly composite aircraft with a carbon fibre wing and glass- and carbon-fibre fuselage. It shares many components with its TL-2000 Sting low wing stablemate. The high wing has a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels with downturned tips and is braced to the lower fuselage with a pair of forward-leaning lift struts. The fin is swept, with a wide dorsal fillet, and carries a horn- balanced rudder. The tapered, mass-balanced elevators are set at mid-fuselage. The underwing cabin of the Sirius has a single piece windscreen, glazed side doors, rear side windows and an upper rear transparency. A choice of flat four engines offers either the 59.6 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912UL or the 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912 ULS. The Sirius is fitted with a fixed tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels fuselage mounted on composite cantilever spring legs. The nosewheel is steerable and the mainwheels have brakes; all wheels are almost completely enclosed in spats. The company has also developed a float installation for the TL-3000 to allow water operations. The Sirus first flew on 21 May 2008 but the prototype was lost in a fatal accident in July. The design has been accepted by the US Federal Aviation Administration as an approved special light-sport aircraft. Operational history The Sirius was designed to fit into both the European ultralight and U.S. LSA categories. Twenty-two aircraft had been sold by September 2010 to customers in Angola, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United States. Only four appeared on the European (Russia excluded) civil aircraft registers in mid-2010, three in the Czech Republic and one in Norway.

The fjord lies along the border between Sortland Municipality and And√∏y Municipality. The Norwegian County Road 82 follows the shoreline around the whole fjord. The coast around the Forfjorden has about 70 inhabitants. The fjord is located about northeast of the town of Sortland and about south of Andenes. The name is derived from its surrounding pine forest, as \\"Furu\\" and \\"Forra\\" translates to pine tree. The long fjord flows to the west and joins the Gavlfjorden along with the Ris√∏ysundet and Sortlandssundet straits. The area around the fjord has rich resources for small and large game hunters, rivers and mountain lakes attracting sports fishermen from near and afar, and a nature reserve with the oldest living pine trees on record in Northern Europe. Among 1000-year-old living trees, trees still standing have been dated to 830 AD. It is assumed that this forest served as source of timber and tar for viking ships, and there are settlements and burial sites that have not yet been excavated. History The Forfjord valley The home of Hans J√∏rgen Furfjord (also known as Hans J√∏rgensen, Hans J√∏rnsa), who led the first expedition to stay the winter on Svalbard, to hunt for silver foxes, walruses, seals and polar bears was located along the Forfjorden. Skins (from silver foxes in particular), salted meat and animal oils were precious commodities at the time. Items from his expeditions are stored in museums in Troms√∏ and on Svalbard and he wrote diaries so far only available in Norwegian. Among weather descriptions and catch reports, they contain well-written stories of adventurous European monarchs visiting, him being imprisoned by British soldiers for not supplying them for free, barely surviving polar bear encounters, and nearly freezing to death in then barren Svalbard during the frozen Artic winters. He was known to be an excellent marksman, but also for his expedition bravery, leadership, determination, blacksmith skills and medical know-how. He died at the age of 81 at home in Forfjord. Hans Michael left behind his second wife Else (Antonsen) and 15 children, most who stayed in Forfjorden and Nordland, including 2 from his first marriage to Elis√© (Lise) Jakobsdatter of Hadsel, who emigrated: Jenny (Furfjord) Sutherland to Canada and Elise (Hansdatter/Hanssen) Hermanson to McGregor, North Dakota, United States.

It is the first feature film that they made together and was developed from an award-winning 2004 short of the same name. Plot summary Strangers opens in Berlin during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Rana Sweid (Lubna Azabal), a Palestinian from Ramallah currently living in Paris, meets Eyal Goldman (Liron Levo), an Israeli who grew up on a kibbutz, after they accidentally switch bags on a train. They eventually strike up a friendship and decide to watch the World Cup together. Their budding romance is cut short when Rana is mysteriously called back to France and asks Eyal to stop seeing her. Despite her request, he seeks her in France. They are then faced with the 2006 Lebanon War as Eyal is drafted by the Israel Defense Forces. Cast *Lubna Azabal - Rana Sweid *Liron Levo - Eyal Goldman *Abdallah El Akal - Rashid Sweid *Patrick Albenque - Semi Jan *Mila Dekker - Simon *Dominique Lollia - Samira Shalach Production In 2004, directors Erez Tadmor and Guy Nattiv submitted a short called Strangers to the Sundance Film Festival. It won the Online Film Festival Viewers Award which led to funding a full length version of the film. They envisioned the feature version as experimental in form, largely improvised and centered around the World Cup in Berlin. Production began in Berlin with one actor (Levo), photographer and producer. They then met with actress Lubna Azabal whom they convinced to join the production via phone by telling her: \\"two actors, one camera and the World Cup Soccer Championships. That's all. No screenplay, only a synopsis, and we want to flow with it.\\" According to the directors, they wanted \\"the actors to improvise their lines without being bound by an official screenplay, and to let the relationship that would develop between the characteristics dictate the flow of the plot.\\" The war broke out two weeks into the Berlin shoot, prompting production to shut down. Tadmor noted that, \\"We immediately made the decision to stop shooting and return home to be with our families. When we continued shooting later in Paris, it was a different movie.\\" The basic premise of the film, a love story, was thus further complicated by the introduction of the war when filming resumed: \\" 'We didn't want to do a war movie or a political movie, but it's there in the background, on the TV and radios - it's all over the place. The characters really continued their relationship while the war was all around them. We tried to avoid the clich√©s of the Arab-Israeli conflict, but you saw how these two characters dealt with it,' said Tadmor.\\" Release After an initial showing at the Jerusalem Film Festival on June 8, 2007, Strangers was released nationwide in Israel on May 29, 2008. It was one of two films shown at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival on the 2006 Lebanon War. The other was Philippe Aractingi's Under the Bombs. IFC Films bought the U.S. rights to Strangers in 2008 after it was screened at Sundance and the Tribeca Film Festival. The DVD was released by Zeitgeist Films on October 18, 2011. Reception Critical response John Anderson of Variety praised the acting as a key factor in making the film a \\"winner\\" with \\"first-rate\\" production values. Emily Wilson of KQED states that: \\"Exploring whether love can overcome political and social barriers is a familiar premise, but Strangers covers the territory in a fresh way. The actors, working mostly without a script, improvised their dialogue, which makes the characters feel less like pawns the filmmakers are moving around to make a point.\\" Accolades Strangers was an Official Selection at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, and the 2008 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival. *Winner: 2007 Jerusalem Film Festival - Most Promising Actress- Lubna Azabal *Nominated: 2008 Sundance Film Festival - Grand Jury Prize, World Cinema-Dramatic *Nominated: 2008 Ophir Award - Best Actor, Liron Levo *Nominated: 2008 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival - International Jury Award See also *Cup Final (film) *Under the Bombs References External links * Category:2006 FIFA World Cup Category:2007 films Category:Arabic-language films Category:Israeli avant-garde and experimental films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 2006 Category:French-language films Category:Hebrew-language films Category:Israeli independent films Category:Israeli films Category:Israeli‚ÄìLebanese conflict films Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict films ","title":"Strangers (2007 Israeli film)"},{"id":"34026331","text":"Richard St. Denis is an attorney from Colorado, a Top 10 CNN Hero of 2011, and a founder of World Access Project, which since 2008 has provided hundreds of wheelchairs and mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural Mexico.

BloomBars is \\"a community-based venture, rooted in the arts, that could serve as an incubator for individual and community growth.\\" Explaining the organization's structure, Chambers has said, \\"cultural shifts in behavior can happen over time if we effectively communicate our value, and help folks understand that a donation is an investment in their growth, and the community‚Äôs growth‚Äîlike our tag, 'You Bloom.

They are one of the most popular rock bands in Bangladesh. The band rose to mainstream fame in the late 2000s and early 2010s with their hit songs like \\"Obocheton\\", \\"Dhushor Bhabna\\", \\"Bir\\" and \\"Kobe\\". They are considered to be one of the pioneers of alternative rock music in Bangladesh. Since 1999, they have released three studio albums. The current line-up includes vocalist Zohad Reza Chowdhury, guitarists Sultan Rafsan Khan and Zafir Huq, bassist Raquibun Nabi Ratul and drummer Dio Haque. History 1999-2003: Formation and Early Days Nemesis was formed in the summer of 1999. Most of the band members had just finished high school and had a lot of spare time in their hands. Saber & Reeshad brought Maher Khan and Yawar Mehboob together to form a band that he wanted to manage. Maher asked his brother Sabin Todamol to play bass setting up as a three piece band. They first performed at New Year's Eve at a rooftop party that Saber arranged. This is where they met Zohad, a school friend of Reeshad & Maher. Zohad joined the band early 2000. Sabin left the band early 2000, when Yawar brought in his school friend Nandito and his cousin Ratul to play rhythm and bass for the band. Nemesis was officially formed then. The band gigged the local underground scene, building a fan base and recognition as a cover band. Zohad brought Dio and Omayr to keep the band going when Yawar and Nandito decided to go abroad for their studies in 2002. The band started work on their first album in 2001 and recorded every summer when Yawar and Nandtio were in town. In 2003, Nemesis first single ‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶§‡¶® was released on the mixed compilation ‡¶Ü‡¶ó‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶ï II (Agontuk II). This was a massive success for the band and brought Nemesis into the light securing them a record deal with G-Series for their first album. 2004-2005: Onneshon (Explore) Onneshon () was recorded partly at Art of Noise studio and at the home studio of Saidus Sumon. The debut album was released in 2005. Yawar left the band in mid 2005 settling in the UK and Nandito settled in Canada shortly after the album was released. Subsequently, Dio and Omayr joined as permanent members. With the release of \\"‡¶ß‡ßÇ‡¶∏‡¶∞ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶®‡¶æ (Gray Idea)\\" (2006) and \\"‡¶ú‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶®‡¶ø (Peals of Victory)\\" the following year, Nemesis also earned mainstream recognition as the singles went on to be included in the Radio Foorti Top 100 Singles of 2006, 2007 & 2008.TOP-100 (Radio) Hits of 2008 The track \\"‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ (Shadow of Death)\\" also got listed in Radio Foorti's Top Songs of 2010.RADIO FOORTI TOP 100 SONGS OF 2010 [By SHEAUM] \\\\- 21 April 2011 - Free4All BD Collection During the years following their debut in 2005, Nemesis went on performing in numerous concerts and events that largely promoted social awareness and issues amongst other relevant affairs. Of these, the events well worth a mention: \\"Say No To Drugs\\" concert in Gulshan Youth Club (2008), \\"Save the Children\\" and \\"Stand up Against Poverty\\" concerts in the Dhanmondi Amphitheater (2009), \\"Vote for Sundarban\\" concert at the Army Stadium organized by BAMBA (2010).BAMBA presents: Concert for Sundarbans The band has also appeared in several corporate-sponsored events which include the \\"Banglalink Music Festival\\", the series of Tribute shows sponsored by BAT as well as many other shows promoting different brands and products. In addition, the group has also performed at the International Club, the American Club and Aurum's New Years event at The Radisson, December 2009. 2006-2011: Tritio Jatra  The band recorded their second album Tritio Jatra () six years later. The first single from the album, \\"Kobe\\" (pronounced k√¥be) was released in Radio stations earlier in the 2011. They recorded the album in Bengal Studio. In June,2011 they finished recording and mastering the whole album. They managed a record deal with Deadline music (DLM).In late 2011, they released the music video of \\"Kobe\\". The music video was produced by Studio Bangi and was premiered at \\"The Bench\\" on 4 November 2011.The album was launched at Caf√© 33 in Bailey Road on 23 November. In mid 2012, crucial members Maher Khan and Omayr Khan left Nemesis, for personal reasons. The fans were shocked to hear the news. Zerif Ahmed and Zeheen Ahmed, sons of Manam Ahmed of band Miles, were brought in to replace them. Tritio Jatra got nominated for The Best Band Award of 2011 (Popular Choice and Critic), for The Best Sounding Album Award and For Best Music Video Award (Song: kobe. Under Studio Bangi) in Citycell Channel I Music Awards. On 27 February 2013, Nemesis won The Best Band Award of 2011 under Critic choice. 2012-2015: Social activism Nemesis have participated in different charity shows. Recently they have performed in a charity concert arranged by Bangladesh International Recovery Developments(BIRD) for street children. Half of the money was donated to Savar victims. In the year 2013, Nemesis played their new song \\"Ghuri\\" at RockNation III. The rave response they received led them to recording the song and releasing it as their single. They also released a video for it in which they played live. It has over a hundred and fifty thousand views as of 2016. In 2015, they played another song at Rocknation VI called \\"Ke Jane Ke Bojhey\\". In 2016, they released it as a single via the Robi Yonder Music App. It was different from their previous singles as it had a more bluesy vibe than its predecessors. Before the recording, Zerif left the band to study in Malaysia. To fill his position, Nemesis brought in a suitable replacement, Sultan Rafsan Khan from the young and brilliant Groove/Thrash metal band Minerva. They told their fans via Instagram and Facebook that they had started recording a new album. They released snippets from the album and its title via Zohad's Instagram. 2016-2017: Gonojowar  The new album is called Gonojowar (). It was released on 10 May 2017 after long 6 years.

He is an X Games gold medalist for skysurfing and accomplished television host for many shows, most notably the MTV series \\"Senseless Acts of Video\\". He was the face of the award-winning 1998 Pepsi Super Bowl commercial. Most recently, Troy built a jet-powered personal backpack and used it on skis and in flight. With the device he was capable of skiing uphill and attaining speeds of up to 47 mph. It can take off from the ground. He is currently developing a jet wing similar to that used by Yves Rossy.  Life and works  Hartman began his work in aviation as a cadet at the United States Air Force Academy, where he developed his skills as a pilot and skydiver. He took up skysurfing in 1993 and competed professionally in the sport alongside Rob Harris (skysurfer) and Patrick de Gayardon. Upon winning the 1997 X Games, he was chosen for the 1998 Pepsi \\"Goose\\" Super Bowl commercial, which was voted the #1 ad by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter. In 1999, Troy was selected as the host and stuntman for the MTV show \\"Senseless Acts of Video\\". Over three seasons of the show, he performed multiple first- ever stunts, including the \\"Plane-to-Plane Skydiving Transfer\\" and \\"Parachute on Fire\\". Some of Hartman's other television show appearances include hosting 13 episodes of No Boundaries on The WB Television Network, host of the Discovery Channel series \\"Secrets to Survival\\", and a stint as the weather man for Good Morning America.

An occasion for war: civil conflict in Lebanon and Damascus in 1860. p.63.Goren, Haim. Dead Sea Level: Science, Exploration and Imperial Interests in the Near East. p.95-96. was a Druze uprising in Syria against the authority of Ibrahim Pasha and effectively against the Egypt Eyalet, ruled by Muhammad Ali. The rebellion was led by Druze clans of Mount Lebanon, with an aim to expel the Egyptian forces, under Ibrahim Pasha considering them as infidels. The revolt was suppressed with a bitter campaign by Pasha, after a major Druze defeat in the Wadi al-Taym, and the Egyptian rule effectively restored in Galilee and Mount Lebanon with a peace agreement signed between the Egyptians and Druze leaders on July 23, 1838. Among the major sites of violence was the city of Safed, where the Jewish community was attacked by Druze rebels in early July 1838. Background The tensions between the Druze and the Egyptians had been mounting since the 1834 Syrian Peasant Revolt (1834).One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries, p. 168, Abraham P. Bloch - 1987 The ruling classes of the region resented Egyptian authority and the Druze in particular resisted the rule of Ibrahim Pasha, who personally considered the Druze as heretics and oppressed them. What sparked the revolt itself, however, was the conscription decree of the Egyptian army. Revolt The first reports of the Druze uprising came in January 1838.Firro, Kais. A history of the Druzes, Volume 1. pp.70-75 Some 400 troops, led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, governor of Hauran, attacked the Druzes in Tha'la, and suffered the first defeat, as Ali and a large number of his troops were killed. The Egyptian troops, dispatched from Damascus were slaughtered by Druze peasants during the night. Later, a second force of 6,000 regulars was sent, requiring the Druze to reorganize for more serious fighting. The Egyptian army, led by Muhammad Pasha forced the Druze to withdraw but, exhausted from traversing the mountainous terrain, were repelled by the Druze fighters near Smaid. A new Egyptian force, led by Minikly Pasha, Egyptian Minister of War, and Sharif Pasha was again defeated by some 2,000 Druze insurgents. The successive defeats prompted Ibrahim Pasha to arrive from Aleppo by himself. Ibrahim recruited loyal Albanians and recalled reinforcements from Hama, Acre and Aleppo, creating an army which according to British officials counted some 15,000 men. The force blockaded the Lajat field north of Hauran, while Sharif Pasha began negotiations with the insurgents. The Druze refused to lay down their weapons, but concerned with the size of the amounting armies, tried to enlist additional forces to support the revolt from across Syria and Lebanon. The attempt was largely unsuccessful, and effectively failed. In early April, Shibli al-Aryan attempted to secure more fighters from the supportive villages and succeeded in raising some 8,000 fighters. Soon, the Druze of Mount Lebanon began streaming to join the rebel ranks, and from April it seemed the rebellion incorporated the entire Druze community. The main roads were cut by the Druze, disrupting the Egyptian army supplies. At this point, Ibrahim Pasha ordered Emir Bashir Shihab II, his ally, to send 1,000 men to Wadi al-Taym, where the clashes erupted on April 7. The Egyptian army was commanded by Ahmad Bek, consisting of an infantry regiment, 300 Bedouins and 500 irregulars, which succeeded to overwhelm the Druzes with 33 dead, scores wounded and four taken prisoner. Egyptian losses were 13 killed, 65 wounded. Following the defeat by Ahmad Bek, Shibli occupied Rashayya and killed its governor, while Druze volunteers kept flowing in to join his forces. Another reinforcement of 4,000 men was requested by Ibrahim Pasha from Bashir Shihab II, and arrived under the command of Bashir's son. Joined by two sheikhs from Mount Lebanon‚ÄîHasan Junbalat and Nasir ad-Din al-Imad‚Äîthe Druze fighters were led into Wadi Bakka, where on July 4 they suffered a decisive defeat, losing some 640 men including al-Imad. In early July, tensions still mounted as the Druze captured an Egyptian garrison outside of Safed.Rossoff, David. Safed: the mystical city. p.162-165. The local Safed militia of several hundred was heavily outnumbered by the Druze, and the city was gripped in despair as the militia eventually abandoned the city and the Druze rebels entered the city on July 5. The resulting plunder by the Druze rebels, which targeted the Jewish community, lasted for three days.p. 189 Much of the local population sought refuge in Acre. Subsequently, Shibli moved to southern Wadi al-Taym, where he was attacked by the Christian fighters of Emir Bashir, led by his son Emir Khalil. The attack was unsuccessful, and the Druze succeeded in withstanding the pressure until July 17, when Egyptian reinforcements crushed them at Shebaa. Shibli and 1,500 of his men fled to Mount Hermon, while most of the insurgents in Hauran surrendered and were granted amnesty. Agreement The critical points to end the rebellion were the water war, engaged by Egyptian forces upon the Druze population and the effective defeat of the main insurgent force in Wadi al-Taym. It persuaded Druze leaders to negotiate peace with Ibrahim Pasha. Sheikh Hasan al-Bitar of Rashaya and the Christian Jiris Abu ad-Dibs mediated the agreement, whereby Ibrahim Pasha agreed to give amnesty to insurgents and to put the Druze into forced labor in lieu of exemption from conscription, in return for the surrender of Druze arms and those seized from Egyptians. The agreement was signed on July 23, 1838. At first, the Druze willingly surrendered their arms, but it soon became clear, that those were not the arms that had been used in the fighting, prompting Ibrahim Pasha to send his officers with a demand for an immediate surrender of the entire Druze arsenal. The process continued slowly, and lasted until August. Aftermath Small groups of insurgents still refused to lay their weapons, including Shibli in Mount Hermon and sheikh Husain Abu Asaf in Lajat. Shibli eventually fled to Baalbek, but forced into hiding, he finally surrendered to the Egyptians. When Shibli met Ibrahim Pasha, he proposed his services as an irregular, and was accepted into Egyptian service. Shibli was later sent out of the country, appointed to Sinar. Apparently, Shibli was still in service of Ibrahim by late 1840, when Egyptians began evacuating Syria and Lebanon. The last 100 Druze rebels in Lajat were joined by another 400 Druze insurgents by 1839, and were reportedly devastated a village near Hasbaya. The dominance of Ibrahim Pasha over Ottoman Syria diminished with the 1840 agreement, which was signed during the Second Egyptian-Ottoman War (1839-1841).

A circus once wintered on the grounds of the home. Edward Fairfax Neild Sr. (December 3, 1884 - July 6, 1955), was an American architect originally from Shreveport, Louisiana, who designed the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri. He was selected for the task by U.S. President Harry Truman. Biography The son of George Frederick Neild (1855-1933) and the former Elizabeth Moss, Neild graduated in 1906 from the School of Engineering at Tulane University in New Orleans. He then traveled in Europe to study architecture and applied arts. He worked alone from 1908 to 1934. He was in partnerships Neild, Somdal and Neild, Somdal, Neild, with Dewey A.

Nield Jr., in 1951.Past Presidents, AIA Shreveport In 1948, Neild was among twenty distinguished architects made fellows of the American Institute of Architects. During World War II, Neild designed for the United States Army Corps of Engineers the Japanese American concentration camps in southeastern Arkansas at Rohwer and Jerome in Desha and Drew counties, respectively. Other Neild-designed buildings in Shreveport include: the Louisiana State Exhibit Building at the Louisiana State Fairgrounds, Schumpert Hospital, Barret Elementary School, C. E. Byrd High School, the Scottish Rite Cathedral, the Calanthean Temple, Cathedral of St. John Berchmans (Shreveport, Louisiana), and the Overton Brooks Veterans Administration Medical Center. When Truman toured Louisiana, he was so impressed with Neild's design of the Caddo Parish Courthouse that he contacted him to design the courthouse for his own Jackson County, Missouri. Neild was a consulting architect for the rehabilitation of the White House during the Truman years as well as the lead architect of the Truman Presidential Library. He also designed many campus buildings for Louisiana Tech University in Ruston.The Louisiana Historical Association used the Kansas City Star, July 6, 1955, and The New York Times and New Orleans Times-Picayune, both July 7, 1955, in its biographical sketch of Edward F. Neild. A number of Neild's works have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as significant buildings for their architecture. Nield's son, Edward F. Neild Jr. (1908 - 1958), was also an architect who designed the Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport. From 1937 to 1938, the two men worked together on the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum in Shreveport, which opened in 1939. In addition to their son, Neild and his wife, the former Ethel Land (1887-1970), who married on December 17, 1907, had a daughter, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Neild Van Hook (1915-2010), the wife of the late James A.

Overview Gaye originally recorded the song in 1972 as he was working on a wide variety of projects. The song had two distinct versions. The initial recording was later issued as a single to promote a compilation album in 1986, while an alternate vocal version would later be included in the Deluxe Edition reissue of Let's Get It On in 2001. Gaye had originally planned to release the song on the album You're the Man, but due to Motown's mild response to that album's title track, it was never released, and Gaye later released Let's Get It On instead. In 1986, Motown, having helped Columbia Records feature songs on two posthumous studio albums, decided to release more Gaye recordings from the singer's Motown archives. This song was included along with other songs, including Gaye's original recording of the Ashford & Simpson composition, \\"Dark Side of the World\\", later recorded by Diana Ross on her self titled debut solo album. While Gaye's 1960s recordings were overdubbed with 1980s production, the singer's 1970s recordings, including this song, were left in their original versions. The song was produced by longtime Motown producer Hal Davis, who was to be the second producer on You're the Man, as he had helped produce other Gaye songs from the sessions, including \\"Piece of Clay\\" and \\"Where Are We Going?\\" Recorded in a funk style, it was a biting diatribe of the inner city, much like a previous Gaye track, \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\". in which Gaye delivered in a gospel sermon-inspired vocal, with backup from strings, horns, a solo saxophone riff, and a rhythm section. To promote the compilation, Motown issued \\"The World Is Rated X\\" as a promotional single. It failed to make any chart. It was then issued on Gaye's Anthology set in 1995. The alternate vocal version of the song was released on the Deluxe Edition reissue of Let's Get It On six years later. Chart performance The song peaked at number 95 on the UK singles chart.

The Diamondbacks (often shortened as the D-Backs), an American professional baseball team based in Phoenix, Arizona, were formed in 1998, based at Bank One Ballpark. This followed five years of preparation under the leadership of Jerry Colangelo. The Diamondbacks won the World Series championship in 2001, becoming the fastest expansion team in the Major Leagues to win a championship, doing so in only the fourth season since inception in 1998. Financial difficulties were then encountered and the home field was renamed to Chase Field in 2005, as a result of Bank One Corporation's merger with JPMorgan Chase & Co. After a lean period the team won the National League West division in 2011. Franchise history The desire for baseball in the desert Between 1940 and 1990, Phoenix jumped from the 99th largest city in the nation to the 9th largest (it is currently the 5th largest). As such, it was frequently mentioned as a possible location for either a new or relocated MLB franchise. Baseball had a rich tradition in Arizona long before talk of bringing a big-league team even started. The state has been a frequent spring training site since 1946. With a large number of people relocating to the state from the Midwest and the Northeast, as well as from California, many teams (most notably the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers) have normally had large followings in Arizona. The first serious attempt to land an expansion team for the Phoenix area was mounted by Elyse Doherty and Martin Stone, owner of the Phoenix Firebirds, the city's triple-A minor league baseball team and the top affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. In the late 1980s Stone approached St. Louis (football) Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill about sharing a proposed 70,000 seat domed stadium in Phoenix. It was taken for granted that a domed stadium was a must for a major-league team to be a viable venture in the Phoenix area. Phoenix is by far the hottest major city in North America; the average high temperature during baseball's regular season is , and game-time temperatures well above are very common during the summer. Bidwill, with plans already in the works to leave St. Louis, opted instead to sign a long-term lease with Arizona State University to use its Sun Devil Stadium as the home of his soon-to-be Arizona-based NFL franchise. Since baseball-only stadiums were not seen as fiscally viable during that era, this effectively ended Stone's bid. In the fall of 1993, Jerry Colangelo, majority owner of the Phoenix Suns, the area's NBA franchise, announced he was assembling an ownership group, \\"Arizona Baseball, Inc.\\", to apply for a Major League Baseball expansion team. This was after a great deal of lobbying by the Maricopa County Sports Authority, a local group formed to preserve Cactus League spring training in Arizona and eventually secure a Major League franchise for the state. Colangelo's group was so certain that they would be awarded a franchise that they held a name-the-team contest for it; they took out a full-page ad in the sports section of the February 13, 1995 edition of the state's leading newspaper, the Arizona Republic. First prize was a pair of lifetime season tickets awarded to the person who submitted the winning entry. The winning choice was \\"Diamondbacks\\", after the Western diamondback, a rattlesnake native to the region known for injecting a large amount of venom when it strikes. Bank One Ballpark (now Chase Field) in April, 2005. Colangelo's bid received strong support from one of his friends, Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and media reports say that then- acting Commissioner of Baseball and Milwaukee Brewers founder Bud Selig was also a strong supporter of Colangelo's bid.AZStarNet.com Plans were also made for a new retractable-roof ballpark, Bank One Ballpark, nicknamed the BOB, (renamed in 2005 to Chase Field) to be built in an industrial/warehouse district on the southeast edge of downtown Phoenix, one block from the Suns' America West Arena (now Talking Stick Resort Arena). On March 9, 1995, Colangelo's group was awarded a franchise to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball. The Tampa Bay Area was also granted a franchise, the Devil Rays (to be based in St. Petersburg), at the same time. Arizona had originally been intended to join Tampa Bay in the American League. However, five American League teams had threatened to block the league assignments because of concerns that they would have additional games out of their time zone, causing early starts that would decrease revenue and TV ratings. Thus, on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League while their expansion counterparts in Tampa Bay were voted into the American League. MLB reserved the right to unilaterally move either the Diamondbacks or Devil Rays to another league within the first five years of existence. After the 2001 season, with the possibility of the Twins and Expos being eliminated, it was possible the Diamondbacks would move to the American League. However, MLB's franchise contraction plans never materialized. According to the original press release from Colangelo's group (which remained posted on the team website during the first few seasons) the chosen team colors were Arizona turquoise, copper, black and purple. \\"... Turquoise was chosen because the greenish-blue stone is indigenous to Arizona, copper because Arizona is one the nation's top copper-producing states and purple because it has become a favorite color for Arizona sports fans, thanks to the success of the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns.\\" The distinctive \\"A\\" logo and color scheme was developed by Campbell Fisher Ditko, a Phoenix-based graphic design firm (which also designed the now-iconic \\"Streaking Sun\\" logo for the Suns for the 1992 season). In the earliest days, the Diamondbacks operated as a subsidiary of the Suns; several executives and managers with the Suns and America West Arena were brought over to the Diamondbacks in similar roles. Members of the Suns team, including Kevin Johnson, Danny Ainge (who actually briefly played baseball at the beginning of his career for the Toronto Blue Jays), Danny Manning and coach Paul Westphal, joined Colangelo and modeled the first prototype Diamonbacks uniforms at a publicity event in November 1995. A regional team From the beginning, Colangelo wanted to market the Diamondbacks to a statewide fan base and not limit fan appeal to Phoenix and its suburbs. Colangelo decided to call the team the \\"Arizona Diamondbacks\\" rather than the \\"Phoenix Diamondbacks\\". Although every Major League Baseball team does cultivate fans from outside its immediate metropolitan area, and even though the greater Phoenix area has 2/3 of the statewide population, there are long-standing historic rivalries between Phoenix and Arizona's other cities, such as Tucson, which at times diminish statewide appeal and enthusiasm for a Phoenix-based team. A series of team-sponsored fan motor coach trips from Tucson to Bank One Ballpark were inaugurated for the opening season and are still in operation to this day (it is now known as the \\"D-backs Express\\"). The Diamondbacks are also known for the \\"Hometown Tour\\", held in January, where selected players, management and broadcasters make public appearances, hold autograph signings, etc., in various locations around Phoenix and Tucson, as well as many small and mid-sized towns in other areas of Arizona. Despite their early efforts to appeal to the entire state, in 2009 the Diamondbacks moved their Triple-A Pacific Coast League farm team, the Tucson Sidewinders, to Reno, where they are now known as the Aces. In 2011, they also moved their spring training base from Tucson to a new stadium near the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. Further preparations Two years before their first opening day, Colangelo hired the then-recently fired Buck Showalter, the American League Manager of the Year in 1994 with the New York Yankees, as the D-Backs' first manager. Their lower level Minor League Baseball teams began play in 1996; the expansion draft was held in November 1997. 1998‚Äì2002: Early success and a World Series championship The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the Colorado Rockies on March 31, 1998, at Bank One Ballpark before a standing-room only crowd of 50,179. Tickets had gone on sale on January 10 and sold out before lunch. The Rockies won, 9‚Äì2, with Andy Benes on the mound for the Diamondbacks, and Travis Lee being the first Diamondbacks player to get a hit (a single in his first MLB at bat), then became the first Diamondback to score, homer and drive in a run in his second MLB plate appearance. In their first five seasons of existence, the Diamondbacks won three division titles (1999, 2001, 2002) a National League pennant (2001) and a World Series championship (2001). In 1999, Arizona won 100 games in only its second season to win the NL West title. They lost to the New York Mets in four games in the NLDS. Colangelo fired Showalter after a relatively disappointing 2000 season, and replaced him with Bob Brenly, the former Giants catcher and coach, who had up to that point been working as a color analyst on Diamondbacks television broadcasts. In 2001, the team was led by two of the most dominant pitchers in all of baseball: Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. Arizona had postseason victories over the St. Louis Cardinals (3‚Äì2 in the NLDS) and the Atlanta Braves (4‚Äì1 in the NLCS) to advance to the World Series where, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City, they beat the three-time reigning champions, the New York Yankees, 4‚Äì3, to become the youngest expansion franchise to win the World Series (in just their fourth season of play). The previous mark was held by the Florida Marlins. This was the first time since that the home team won all seven games of a World Series, and the Diamondbacks were the first National League team to do so. An estimated orderly crowd of over 300,000 celebrated at the Diamondbacks victory parade, held at Bank One Ballpark and the surrounding downtown Phoenix streets on November 7, 2001. This was the first men's major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona and the first for a team (in the four major North American professional sports leagues) owned or controlled by Colangelo, whose basketball Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA Finals in 1976 and 1993 but lost both times. The team finished the 2002 season with a 98‚Äì64 record and won their third NL West title in five years, but were swept out in the NLDS by the St. Louis Cardinals. Randy Johnson was awarded with his fourth consecutive Cy Young Award as well the Major League Baseball Triple Crown. 2003‚Äì2005: Tough times and the end of the Colangelo era Arizona ended the 2003 season with an 84‚Äì78 record, in 3rd place in the NL West. Both Johnson and Schilling had suffered injuries during the season and Schilling was traded in the off season to the Boston Red Sox where he contributed to that team's 2004 World Series victory. By this time, Colangelo and the other partners were embroiled in a dispute over the financial health and direction of the Diamondbacks. Nootably, Colangelo had asked several key players on the 2001 World Series champions to defer their salaries; by 2004, they and others were owed $150 million. Colangelo's willingness to go into debt and acquire players through free agency had led to one of the quickest free falls in major sports history. In 2004, the Diamondbacks were only above .500 once all season, and by the end of June they were 28‚Äì50, their season all but finished. Just three years after winning the World Series and two years after winning their third division title in four years, the Diamondbacks had dropped to a dismal 51‚Äì111 record, the worst in Major League Baseball and one of the 10 worst records (in terms of losses) in the modern era. This came despite Johnson pitching a perfect game on May 18 of that season. Brenly was fired partway through the season and was replaced on an interim basis by third base coach Al Pedrique. The .315 winning percentage is still the worst in franchise history. Colangelo also did not finish out the season. He was forced to resign as managing general partner in the late summer of 2004. In a 2004 interview with columnist Hal Bodley of USA TODAY, Colangelo defended his actions: Colangelo sold his general partnership shares to a group of investors who were all involved as partners in the founding of the team in 1995. The investors include equal partners Ken Kendrick, Mike Chipman, and Jeffrey Royer. Kendrick became managing general partner. Jeff Moorad, a former sports agent, joined the partnership, and was named the team's CEO; becoming its primary public face. Following the 2004 season, the Diamondbacks hired Wally Backman to be the team's manager. Backman was formerly manager of the Class A California League Lancaster JetHawks, one of the Diamondbacks' minor-league affiliates. In a turn of events that proved to be a minor embarrassment for the reorganized ownership group, Backman was almost immediately fired after management learned, after the fact, of legal troubles and improprieties in Backman's past. Former Seattle Mariners manager and Diamondbacks bench coach Bob Melvin became the new manager after only a ten-day tenure for Backman. Following the Backman incident, the Diamondbacks spent heavily on free agents in order to re-build. The club signed 3B Troy Glaus, P Russ Ortiz, SS Royce Clayton, and 2B Craig Counsell, among others. They then entered into a three-way deal with the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers: Randy Johnson was sent to the New York Yankees, for Javier V√°zquez, Brad Halsey, and Dioner Navarro who was then dealt to the Dodgers for Shawn Green. Finally, they traded Casey Fossum to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Jos√© Cruz, Jr. The Diamondbacks were considered by some to be the favorite to win the division after spending on the aforementioned free agents; however, injuries hurt the team's chances of reaching its expected potential. The Diamondbacks, led by Melvin, finished the 2005 season with a record of 77 wins and 85 losses. Though a losing season, this was a 26-game improvement over 2004, and sufficient for second place in a woefully weak NL West, five games behind the San Diego Padres. In May 2005, the Diamondbacks hired Derrick Hall from the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was named President of the club in September of the next year. In October 2005 the Diamondbacks hired 35-year-old Josh Byrnes, assistant general manager of the Boston Red Sox, to replace the outgoing Joe Garagiola, Jr. as Diamondbacks General Manager. Garagiola took a position in Major League Baseball's main offices in New York City. 2006: Rebuilt and reloaded In a weak NL West division, the Diamondbacks failed to improve on their 2005 performance, finishing fourth with a slightly worse record than the year before. The season did include two excellent individual performances, however. 2B Orlando Hudson became the recipient of his second career Gold Glove Award, as announced on November 3 becoming only the sixth infielder in major league history to win a Gold Glove award in both the American and National Leagues. On November 14, it was announced that RHP Brandon Webb was the recipient of the Cy Young Award for the National League. Webb, a specialist in throwing the sinkerball, received 15 of 32 first-place votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Webb went 16‚Äì8 with a 3.10 ERA and in the 2006 season was named to his first All-Star team. Several significant trades were made during the off season. The Diamondbacks and Brewers made a trade on November 25, 2006. Johnny Estrada, Greg Aquino, and Claudio Vargas were dealt to the Milwaukee Brewers for Doug Davis, Dana Eveland, and Dave Krynzel. On Sunday January 7, it was announced that Randy Johnson would return to the Diamondbacks on a two-year contract, pending a physical. He was obtained from the Yankees in exchange for Luis Vizca√≠no, Ross Ohlendorf, Alberto Gonz√°lez and Steven Jackson, with the Yankees paying $2 million of Johnson's $26 million salary. The Diamondbacks and Florida Marlins made a deal March 26 to acquire RHP Yusmeiro Petit in exchange for Jorge Julio and cash. 2007: A new look and a return to the playoffs The Diamondbacks announced in early September 2006 that their uniforms, which remained largely unchanged since the team's first season, would be completely redesigned for the 2007 season. Details were supposed to be kept from the public until after the 2006 postseason as per MLB rules, but the Diamondback page from the 2007 MLB Official Style Guide was somehow leaked around September 25, and local media broadcast printed the new design for all to see. Of great surprise to many fans was a brand new color scheme; apparently the original colors used by the franchise since Major League Baseball awarded it to Jerry Colangelo's ownership group in 1995 were to be discontinued. While some fans applauded the redesign, most of the reaction to the new color scheme, which included the changing of the historical purple and traditional Arizonan colors of copper and turquoise to a reddish color known as \\"Sedona Red\\" similar to those of the Coyotes and Cardinals color schemes, was pointedly negative. The official unveiling of the uniforms came at a charity event on November 8 in nearby Scottsdale, where several of the players modeled the uniforms on a runway, and posed for publicity photos. The distinctive \\"A\\" design remained unchanged save for the colors. The stylized snake-like \\"D\\" logo, also used since the early days for the road uniforms, was slightly redesigned and a completely new shoulder patch introduced. The lettering on the jerseys was completely redesigned. \\"Sedona Red\\" became the dominant color scheme used throughout Chase Field and in all marketing and promotional materials for the Diamondback ball club. Not only did the Diamondbacks uniforms change, but many faces of the organization changed as well. Fan favorite and Diamondbacks stalwart Luis Gonzalez did not return as the left fielder for the Diamondbacks. The most popular player in franchise history, \\"Gonzo\\" signed a one-year contract worth just under $7 million on December 7 to play for the rival Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2007 season. Craig Counsell, Miguel Batista and Jay Bell, also signed with other teams, as did Thom Brennaman, the original Diamondbacks play-by-play man. In the 2007 regular season, the Diamondbacks enjoyed success with a young team including Brandon Webb, Conor Jackson, Stephen Drew, Carlos Quentin, Chad Tracy, Chris Young, Miguel Montero, Mark Reynolds (called up from Double-A in May) and Justin Upton (called up from Double-A in August). Despite being outscored over the season, the Diamondbacks posted the best record in the NL with 90 wins and 72 losses. Their unorthodox style led to the team adopting an unofficial motto coined by 1st baseman Tony Clark; \\"Anybody, Anytime.\\" On September 28, the Diamondbacks defeated the Colorado Rockies to secure a position in the 2007 playoffs. After the Padres' defeat at the hands of the Milwaukee Brewers on September 29, the Diamondbacks secured both the NL West title and home field advantage throughout the NL playoffs. After taking the first two games at home against the Cubs, in the National League Division Series, they took the series to Wrigley Field, where they completed their sweep, earning their first berth in the National League Championship Series since 2001. In the NLCS, they faced the Colorado Rockies again. The Rockies had been on an incredible winning pace since the All Star break, and they swept the Diamondbacks in four games. ;2007 off season On December 3, 2007 the Diamondbacks traded Carlos Quentin, who had failed to perform to expectation, to the Chicago White Sox for first base prospect Chris Carter. On December 14, in a blockbuster trade, the Diamondbacks acquired starting RHP Dan Haren from the Oakland Athletics for six players: LHP Brett Anderson, LHP Dana Eveland and LHP Greg Smith; the above-mentioned just-acquired infielder Chris Carter; and outfielders Aaron Cunningham and Carlos Gonz√°lez. The team also traded relief pitcher Jos√© Valverde, who led the major leagues in saves in 2007 with 47, to the Houston Astros for reliever Chad Qualls, RHP Juan Guti√©rrez and IF/OF Chris Burke. Haren was 15‚Äì9 with a 3.07 ERA for Oakland in 2007. On August 5, 2008 Dan Haren signed a four-year, $44.75 million deal with the Diamondbacks worth a guaranteed $41.25 million through 2012 and including a $15.5 million club option for 2013 with a $3.5 million buyout. 2008‚Äì2010: Under performance and management changes =2008= Randy Johnson pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks. After winning the opening game of the season on March 31 on the road against the Cincinnati Reds, the Diamondbacks found themselves with the best record in Major League Baseball, 20‚Äì8, by the start of May. At that time, they also led the NL West by 6.5 games. Despite the strong start, the team played poorly in May and June and entered the All Star break at 47‚Äì48, still leading the NL West. Orlando Hudson underwent season-ending surgery on his left wrist August 9 in the wake of a collision with catcher Brian McCann of the Atlanta Braves. Hudson was due to become a free agent at the end of the season and would not be re-signed. LF Eric Byrnes was on the 60-day disabled list from late June, with a torn left hamstring, and was out for the remainder of the season. On August 11, 2008, Dallas Buck, RHP Micah Owings, and C Wilkin Castillo were traded to the Reds (in last place in the NL Central at the time) in exchange for OF Adam Dunn. Dunn, who was tied for the major league lead with 32 home runs, was expected to provide a significant boost to an offense that has struggled to score runs for most of the season. Dunn seemed quite positive about being traded to a ball club in first place in its division in August. The move was seen by some fans as a belated attempt by the D-backs to counter the trade by their division rival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for Boston Red Sox power-hitting OF Manny Ramirez on July 31 and also to compensate for the injuries to Hudson and Byrnes, generally considered two of the more \\"power-hitting\\" Diamondbacks on a team which has relied heavily on pitching and defense in recent years. A free agent at the end of the season, on February 11, 2009, Dunn agreed to a two-year $20 million contract with the Washington Nationals. On August 31, the Diamondbacks acquired former World Series MVP David Eckstein to fill the hole at second base which was opened after Orlando Hudson was placed on the disabled list. Eckstein was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays for Minor League pitcher Chad Beck. Despite the acquisitions, the team failed to improve and finished with a record of 82‚Äì80, in second place behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. =2009= In January 2009, team President Derrick Hall was named CEO as Jeff Moorad left the Diamondbacks to pursue an ownership bid with the San Diego Padres. Managing general partner Kendrick now became the public face of the ownership group and the operating head of the franchise. On May 8, after going 12‚Äì17 in 29 games, the Diamondbacks released manager Bob Melvin and hired A. J. Hinch. The season ended with the Diamondbacks in last place and a record of 70 wins and 92 losses. The Diamondbacks' tough year was blamed on a struggling offense, and an inadequate pitching staff which had a collective ERA of 4.18. =2010= The Diamondbacks ended the 2010 season with a 65‚Äì97 record. This poor performance was blamed on an extremely weak bullpen, which finished with a collective 5.47 ERA, and a lack of offense which was punctuated by the team setting the single season strikeout record.Big Whiffas!D'Backs set season strikeout record with 1,403 Ks and ending the season with 1,529.2010 Team Stats On July 1, general manager Josh Byrnes and manager A. J. Hinch were fired and replaced on an interim basis by Jerry Dipoto and Kirk Gibson respectively. (Gibson was later named the manager on a permanent basis, but Dipoto was replaced by Kevin Towers) 2011: Worst to first In a season projected by many to be a last place finish, the Arizona Diamondbacks bucked expectations maintaining playoff contention at the All Star break with a 49‚Äì43 record, only 3 games behind the 1st place San Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks' success has been credited to the approach of manager Kirk Gibson as well as strong starting pitching behind Ian Kennedy, Daniel Hudson, Joe Saunders, and rookie Josh Collmenter as well as a much improved bullpen led by closer J. J. Putz. The franchise opened Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, their new Spring training home in Scottsdale to rave reviews. The D-backs share the complex with the Colorado Rockies. The Diamondbacks' ballpark, Chase Field played host to the 2011 All-Star game on July 12. This was highlighted by the first use of the designated hitter rule in a National League ballpark. Toward the end of the trade deadline on July 31, 2011, the Diamondbacks acquired Washington Nationals right-handed pitcher Jason Marquis to strengthen their starting rotation, in exchange for Minor League shortstop Zach Walters. The day after, in a move to boost their bullpen strength, consistency and depth, the Diamondbacks acquired reliever Brad Ziegler from the Oakland Athletics in exchange for first baseman Brandon Allen and reliever Jordan Norberto. On August 23, the Diamondbacks traded struggling second baseman Kelly Johnson to the Toronto Blue Jays for second baseman Aaron Hill and shortstop John McDonald. The Diamondbacks surged after the All Star Break, posting a 45‚Äì25 record. On September 23, the Diamondbacks defeated the San Francisco Giants 3‚Äì1 to clinch the National League West division title. They ended the season with a 94‚Äì68 record, a 29-game reversal over the prior year's performance. The Arizona Diamondbacks faced the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2011 National League Division Series, but lost 3‚Äì2 in the decisive game 5 in 10 innings. 2012 The Diamondbacks' 2012 season was less fruitful. The team did not have as much from team stars such as Ian Kennedy, Chris Young, Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, successor Daniel Hudson. Hudson had season-ending Tommy John surgery, and Drew was traded to the Oakland A's for a couple of minor leaguers. On October 21, the D-backs traded Star Chris Young to the A's for a shortstop and used his salary and a minor league reliever to acquire closer Heath Bell from the Miami Marlins. The season did introduce new stars such as Wade Miley and Chris Johnson. Wade Miley was a rookie who led the team in wins and strike outs. He also broke the franchise record for most wins by a rookie. Chris Johnson was acquired in a trade with the Houston Astros. He hit 5 home runs including a grand slam in his first 10 games. Also, at the trade deadline, the D-backs tried to complete a \\"monster\\" trade with the Chicago Cubs that would include at the time, the league leader in E.R.A, Ryan Dempster. They didn't get the trade in time and lost Dempster to the Texas Rangers. The Aaron Hill Era Aaron Hill was a lesser known second baseman that the D-backs received from the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Kelly Johnson a few years before. In July 2012, Aaron Hill made history by becoming the first player to hit two cycles in one year during the modern era. He was the fourth to do so all time, joining the ranks of John Reilly, Babe Herman, and Tip O'Neill . He was also the fastest to do so, accomplishing this feat within of 2 weeks. 2013‚Äì2019 In 2013, the Diamondbacks could not improve on their 81‚Äì81 season of 2012. They remained the same yet finished 2nd in the NL West. It marked the 3rd straight non-losing season which was their best streak since their early days of 1999‚Äì2003. Despite having some form of relevance, they managed to have a down year in 2014 with a Major League worst 64‚Äì98 record. 2015 marked the last season of Arizona's uniforms that were released prior to the 2007 season which resulted in an underwhelming but improved 79‚Äì83 record. 2016 saw a new change not only in uniforms but bringing back the teal color on the team colors as well. Star pitcher Zack Greinke from the Los Angeles Dodgers signed a 6-year, $206 million contract with the Diamondbacks and while his first year saw the team at 69‚Äì93, 10 games worse than last season, he helped with being a part of a growing team. 2017 marked the first playoff berth since 2011 and the first ever wild card berth for Arizona. The Diamondbacks finished 93‚Äì69, a 24-game reversal of 2016. They faced the division rival Colorado Rockies in a thrilling wild card playoff which resulted in an 11‚Äì8 win to face the Dodgers in the NLDS. However their season came down to an end in a 3‚Äì0 sweep. 2018 marked another winning season at 82‚Äì80, a feat not achieved since 2007-08 but failed to qualify for consecutive playoff berths, finishing 3rd in the NL West. The Diamondbacks had a mediocre start to 2019, reaching the end of July with a 54‚Äì55 record. They traded Greinke to the Houston Astros on July 31, but improved the following two months to finish second in the NL West at 85‚Äì77. 2020 References Category:Arizona Diamondbacks Arizona Diamondbacks ","title":"History of the Arizona Diamondbacks"},{"id":"34026674","text":"Illens Castle is a castle in the municipality of Rossens of the Canton of Fribourg in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The ruins of Illens castle stand on a rock wall above a loop of the Saane/Sarine river. The castle stands on the opposite side of the river from the fortified town of Arconciel. The two castles secured both sides of a crossing (either a ford or a bridge) over the river. The castle is first mentioned between 1150 and 1276. In 1366, the notoriously violent Count Peter of Aarberg moved into the castle and remained there for a short while. The chamberlain of Charles the Bold, Guillaume de la Baume, expanded the castle and when he left in 1470, it was an elegant and comfortable palace. During the conflicts leading up to the Burgundian Wars, Fribourg and Bernese troops stormed and damaged the building on 3 January 1475. In 1900, it was partly repaired and expanded and served a community of Trappist monks.

Here she wrote a textbook and discovered her interest in aging. In 1973, Riley became the first woman full professor at Bowdoin College, where she worked until 1981. She spent much of her career as a sociologist specializing in aging at the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, Riley worked with the Russell Sage Foundation from 1974 to 1977 where she wrote works on the age-stratification paradigm and aging society perspective. Life and education Matilda White Riley was born on April 19, 1911 in Boston, Massachusetts. She was raised by her grandmother in Brunswick, Maine. Riley attended Brunswick High School; there she met her husband John (Jack) W. Riley Jr. In 1931, she earned her bachelor's (and later her master's degree) from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Later that same year, she and John married. They were married for sixty-nine years until John's death in 2002. Together, the couple would have two children, John W. Riley III and Lucy Sallick. Riley and her husband often worked side by side, recurrently co- authoring papers together. Their first joint scientific paper was published in the 1930s and concerned contraceptive behavior. Riley worked as a research assistant at Harvard from 1932‚Äì1933 while John was a graduate student. From 1942 to 1944, Riley worked as a market researcher and an economist for the War Production Board during World War II. Along with her father, Riley established the Market Research Company of America from 1939 to 1949. Later she began a career in the Sociology of Aging at Rutgers University in New Jersey and then at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. In 1972, Riley earned her Doctor of Science degree from Bowdoin College and then in 1973 earned her Doctor in Humane Letters from Rutgers University.

She was also the co-chair of the joint Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA, now SAMSHA)and NIH Steering Committee for the Institute of Medicine's Project on Health and Behavior (1979‚Äì1982). She served as a spokesperson for the National Institute of Health (NIH) for behavioral and social science research, coordinating research programs and giving presentations for the institute. She is credited with founding the Behavioral and Social Research Program at the National Institute on Aging. She and her husband were co-Presidents of the District of Columbia Sociological Society. From 1949 to 1960 she served as the Executive Officer of the American Sociological Association (ASA), and later became the 77th President of the Association. Matilda White Riley had a total of 16 books that she wrote by herself or edited with other authors.

Some of her significant site-specific works are: 5 tables, 1989-2004, which include sculptures from stone and plants located in Germany (Table of Thinking), Spain (Table of the Desert), Sweden (Table of the Sea), Switzerland (The Mountain- Table), Romania (Table for two couples and a dog),http://www.recenseo.de/index.php?id=134&kategorie;=artikel&nav;=Inhalt the sculpture POL-Stein (made of stone) which is located in Bad Oeynhausen, Germany opposite an architectural work of Frank Gehry and set to be a contrast to it, and more recently the chapel of the Johannes Wesling Hospital at Minden (2004-2008), which is recognized as the first hospital chapel in Germany completely developed and built by a contemporary artist.http://www.theomag.de/54/am252.htm Her concern is more and more the conception and development of sculptural systems including material, form and site. She has published books about several of her pieces of art. Being of extraordinary high quality aesthetically (the book Im Inneren des Baumes, 1990, was awarded by the German Stiftung Buchkunst) these books can be considered as a literary expansion of her sculptural work.

On 8 July 2010, Payerne Air Base was the location from which the long-range experimental solar-powered aircraft Solar Impulse 1 achieved the world's first manned 26-hour solar-powered flight. Payerne also became the home base for the successor Solar Impulse 2 (HB-SIB) aircraft, with the aircraft's first flight made from Payerne on 2 June 2014. From 30 August 2014 to 7 September 2014 the International Airshow Air14 took place at Payerne AFB. Today Payerne AFB is the home of the F/A-18 Fighter squadrons Sqd17 Falcons and Sqd18 Panthers, the militia F-5E Tiger II Squadron 6 Ducks, and of the Transport squadron LT1. Every aircraft type of the Swiss Air Force can be seen operating from Payerne.

Air Traffic Control is made by the military branch of Skyguide, Skyguide National. Payerne is responsible for the education of ground crews (aircraft Mechanic,Airport Fire Fighter,..) of the Air Force. Therefore, Payerne is also the main base of the F/A-18C Mock-up X-5098. The F/A-18 flight simulators are also located in Payerne. The A1 motorway (Switzerland) is connected via a taxiway at the hangar 5 with the airfield and can, if necessary, be used as runway for take off - and landing. However, this possibility has never been exploited since the construction of the highway.Book Uno Zero Zero Seite 230 The air base is, at both end of the runway, equipped with retractable Arresting gear devices (used by the F/A-18 and in case of a problem by the F-5).

Description Actinia bermudensis attaches itself to a rock surface by its pedal disc, which can reach 2.5 centimetres (1 in) in width. The column is narrower at the top than the base and can reach 5 centimetres (2 in) in height. Near the top is a ring of bulges called acrorhagi which contain many cnidocytes. The oral disc has a central mouth and two irregular whorls of 96 to 140 short, retractable, tapering tentacles which are armed with cnidocytes. The general colour of the anemone is dark red or maroon. In most of the range, the acrorhagi are blue, but in the waters off northern Florida, they are pink.Red Anemone (Actinia bermudensis) Marine Invertebrates of Bermuda. Retrieved 2011-12-11. Distribution and habitat Actinia bermudensis occurs in the West Indies, Bermuda and northern Florida, and there is a further, isolated population off Brazil. It is found in the intertidal and the sublittoral zone. It is usually found near the base of rock walls, under overhangs, in caves, in crevices and under boulders. Biology The acrorhagi of Actinia bermudensis are used to discourage other individuals from moving into the anemone's territory. Intruding anemones are not normally killed but usually retire to a safer place. Actinia bermudensis is an omnivore. The main items of prey are gastropods, isopods and small bivalves. Other food items may include other marine invertebrates and algae. Many sea anemones form a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae. Actinia bermudensis often contains these flagellate protozoa living within its tissues but they are of a non-photosynthetic species. It is doubtful whether this should be called symbiosis as the anemone does not seem to derive any benefit from the arrangement. At times of food scarcity, however, the anemone may consume the zooxanthellae. Reproduction can take place by fission, the anemone splitting in half longitudinally. The offspring are clones of the parent and genetically identical. Alternatively, sexual reproduction occurs, with internal fertilisation. In this case the juvenile sea anemones are brooded by the parent in the gastrovascular cavity until they have grown sufficiently large to be liberated into the water column. There are ten times as many females among these brooded young as there are males. Another method of reproduction is a form of parthenogenesis with the young being brooded internally. This has been established by examining the degree of genetic similarity between the offspring in the gastrovascular cavity and their parent.Monteiro, F.A., C.M. Russo, A.M. Sole-Cava, 1998.

Early life  Markham was born in London in 1916. His family relocated to Bridge of Allan in Scotland while he was young and returned to London in 1925. He attended several schools in England and in Magdeburg, Germany, but he disliked all of these until he started at St Paul's School in London, aged 15. During his years at St Paul's, he enjoyed his annual summer holidays at his family's house in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. It was there that he met Margaret Mullen, whom he later married.  Research career  He joined Christ's College, Cambridge in 1935, specialising in biochemistry for the second part of his degree. He graduated in 1938 with an upper second class degree and became a PhD student in the laboratory of Norman Pirie, with whom he had worked as an undergraduate. For his thesis, which he completed in 1944, he worked on the isolation of plant viruses, including tomato bushy stunt virus and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Markham continued working in Cambridge following his PhD, joining the Molteno Institute to work on the biochemistry of RNAs. One of his contemporaries at Cambridge was James Watson, who in his book, The Double Helix, recalls seeking TMV for an experiment: He returned to work on the structure of plant viruses at the end of the 1950s. He was particularly interested in using electron microscopy to look at virus architecture.  Virus Research Unit  In 1960, Markham became director of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Virus Research Unit in Cambridge, succeeding Kenneth Smith. The research station was first opened in 1927 and became a research unit of the ARC in 1948.  John Innes Institute  The John Innes Institute moved from Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire to Norwich, Norfolk in 1967, following its association with the newly-formed University of East Anglia (UEA). Before the institute's move was completed, its director, Kenneth S Doods, resigned to take up a position with the Food and Agriculture Organization in Turkey. Roy Markham was appointed as his successor, and he, along with the Virus Research Unit, moved to Norwich in October 1967. Markham played an important role in establishing the institute at its new location. Its move from Bayfordbury had led the majority of the institute's staff to find employment elsewhere, and only 17 staff members moved to Norwich in 1967. However, under Markham's directorship, the institute grew and was reorganised into four new departments: Cell Biology, Genetics, Applied Genetics and Ultrastructural Studies. Markham also persuaded the trustees of the John Innes Foundation, which owned the land on which the institute was built, to provide a large lecture hall and recreational facilities, including a swimming pool, for the staff. He took great interest in developing much of the technology at the new institute and listed himself under the 'Electronics Section' in the institute's annual reports.  Death  Roy Markham suffered a heart attack in 1978, from which he recovered. However, he later developed bowel cancer and died on 16 November 1979.

He is credited as both Daniel and Donald, both acceptable translations for the Gaelic name of 'Domhnull'. Life Dow was born 1732 in Kirkmichael, Perthshire, Scotland and became a music teacher in Edinburgh where he taught, among other instruments, the guitar. In December 1774 at Kirmichael, Perthshire he married Susanna Small of Dirnanean. The couple had four children. Dow died of a fever on 20 January 1783 and is buried in Canongate Church, Edinburgh, Scotland. A concert to benefit his widow and children was given shortly after his death in St. Mary's Hall, Niddry's Wynd, where Dow had often given his own concerts over the years. His son John also became a fiddler. Works About 1775 he issued a collection of \\"Twenty Minuets and Sixteen Reels\\". In 1776 in Edinburgh, Dow published \\"Daniel Dow, A Collection of Ancient Scots Music\\", a collection of 16 songs for the violin, harpsichord or German Flute. This collection included never before printed historical compositions consisting of ports, salutations, marches or piobrachs, making it one of the first publications to include music specifically for the bagpipes. It is one of the important sources of traditional Scottish music. Also in 1776, Dow published Thirty Seven New Reels & Strathspeys for the Violin, Harpsichord, Piano Forte or German Flute. This is the first collection of music to include the word \\"Strathspey\\" in its title. Dow's most famous composition is Monymusk, a contra dance originally published in 1776 under the title of Sir Archibald Grant of Monymusk's Reel. The tune was likely named after Sir Grant's estate near Monymusk, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The composition is considered one of the great Scottish strathspeys. The piece has become ubiquitous in Scotland, Ireland, and North America. Many of Dow's compositions were renamed by Nathaniel Gow and others when including them in their own collections.

Ken's wife, Nancy, is shocked and uncomfortable with Ken's sudden loss of faith and initiates a meeting between Ken and their pastor. During his discussion with Ken, the Reverend learns that Ken's life is going fairly well, except for his mother's declining mental and physical health, and he hasn't taken a vacation in decades. The Reverend suggests that Ken should get out of Lincoln, and after some coaxing, Ken accepts the idea of going on a vacation by himself. While travelling to London the woman seated next to him, Pat, asks about Ken's marriage. She explains to Ken that she is divorced, but that ‚ÄúI get laid whenever I want‚Äù. She then describes how she caught her ex-husband in the act of cheating on her. In spite of his apparent lack of interest, Pat mentions that she might stop by Ken's hotel some time to see him. In London, Ken meets a woman named Tamyra, who is the bartender at his hotel. They talk and become fairly well acquainted with one another. She also manages to get Ken to drink some alcohol, although he previously didn't drink. Act two begins with Ken in the bar talking with Tamyra, when Pat walks into the bar. Later, Ken and Pat are at her place, kissing and moving towards her bed. After she gets him to the bed and sets up a pair of handcuffs, he starts having second thoughts, and tries to get up. Pat continues to try to seduce him. She then tells him he needs to tie her down, and take control of her with leather straps. He is incredibly reluctant, and again tries to leave. By the end of the scene it is suggested that Pat gets what she wants. Pat and Ken never make contact again. While Ken is in London, Nancy remains at home in Nebraska. Ken's daughter, Ashley, is extremely angry at her father and tells Nancy that if her husband ran off, she would have divorced him instantly. Although she continues to be shocked and hurt, Nancy explains that she will try to work things out with Ken when he returns. In London, Ken continues his acquaintance with Tamyra and her flatmate, Harry. Harry and Ken get off to a rocky start, but he two work out their differences and Ken begins taking sculpture lessons from Harry. Both begin work on sculptures of Tamyra, who poses as their model. After Ken learns from his daughter, Ashley, that his mother has died, Ken finds himself at Harry and Tamyra's flat, urgently wishing to speak with Tamyra. Harry informs Ken that she is out of town with a friend. Ken explains that his mother has died, and doesn't know what to do, or where to go. Harry suggests that they work on their sculptures. Ken makes an attempt at working on his sculpture, but finds himself smashing it into a new form, twisting it and making it entirely different than it was before. Ken quickly finishes what he was doing, and gives Harry a nod as he grabs his coat, and leaves. Back in Nebraska for his mother's funeral, Ken speaks with Ashley, who is incredibly displeased with her father. She tells him that she and her husband both think he is going to go to hell. Nancy then comes over to him, hesitantly. She is confused about how to act, and how to feel. She is conflicted with joy to see her husband after many weeks, but also irate that he has been gone for so long, and not spoken to her once. Ken explains to Nancy that he has found his love and faith in God once again, and tries to persuade her that he is better and wants to be with her again. With reluctance, she finally accepts his hand as they walk off stage. Critical reception Reviews were mixed. The TheatreMania reviewer wrote: \\"Letts has created two very intriguing characters in Ken and Nancy, but though he has provided a believable shock to their complacency, his follow- through is a letdown.\\" The Variety reviewer noted \\"[Letts] succeeds quite well at expressing the empty feelings of a man experiencing a crisis of faith, but is far less successful at finding drama or meaning ‚Äî or just raw, abstract emotional power ‚Äî in his search to fill this emptiness.\\" The Chicago Tribune reviewer noted, in a review of a local Chicago production in 2011 that the play is \\"... a bridge between the violent working-class gothic antics of Killer Joe and Bug and the epic angst-with-verbal-fireworks of the now- legendary \\"August: Osage County.\\" Man from Nebraska suggests that being lost and uncertain is our destiny. The best you can hope for is another person groping their way in the dark beside you.\\"Reid, Kerry. \\" 'Man From Nebraska' is Letts' underrated play\\" Chicago Tribune, April 7, 2011  References  External links *Internet Off-Broadway Database Category:American plays Category:2003 plays Category:Plays by Tracy Letts ","title":"Man from Nebraska"},{"id":"34027858","text":"The Townsend Hotel is a luxury boutique hotel located in the Metro Detroit city of Birmingham, Michigan.

Life In the summer of 1820, while still a student, he went as a surgeon in a whaling ship to the Arctic seas. Obtaining the Apothecaries' Hall qualification in 1823, it was not till twenty years later that he became a member of the College of Surgeons. In 1862 he graduated M.D. at the University of St Andrews. He early settled at Albion Street Shelton, Staffordshire (now Hanley), and was a medical practitioner till his death on 19th May 1881. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1868. He was active in local life and was an important member of the Athenaeum, Stoke-upon-Trent. As such he played a part in establishing the first Museum of the Natural History, Pottery and Antiquities. Collection and works In 1836 he published a Popular Manual of the Art of Preserving Health. Davis collected a museum of skulls and skeletons of various races, nearly all with histories; it was larger than all the collections in British public museums put together, numbering 1474 in 1867.Helen Patricia MacDonald, Human Remains: dissection and its histories (2006), p. 96; Google Books.

He corresponded with travellers, collectors, and residents in foreign countries. In 1856 he began with John Thurnam, the publication of Crania Britannica: delineations and descriptions of the skulls of the aboriginal and early inhabitants of the British islands, with text, plates and an accompanying atlas. The work was completed in 1865. In 1867 he published a catalogue of the collection called Thesaurus Craniorum, describing and figuring many specimens, and giving 25,000 measurements. In 1875 a supplement to the Thesaurus was published. In 1879 or 1880 the Royal College of Surgeons purchased the collection, then numbering 1800 crania and some skeletons.Christine Quigley, Skulls and Skeletons: human bone collections and accumulations (2001), p. 141; Google Books. As well as his collection of human remains, Davis was an avid collector of books, photographs, prints, drawings and artefacts relating to many cultural groups. Amongst his collection were works of art and artefacts collected originally by George Augustus Robinson from Tasmania and from the state of Victoria, Australia. The Australian works were mainly purchased by Davis after Robinson‚Äôs death from Robinson‚Äôs widow.Numbloote (aka Jenny). British Museum. Davis also bought art works relating to Tasmanian Aborigines directly from the artist John Skinner Prout.Hohepa Teumuroa (Hohepa Te Umuroa), New Zealand. British Museum.

According to others, she was the daughter of a doctor, and was born in Nogent-le-Rotrou, or that she was the daughter of a businesswoman. There is no evidence to support these allegations. In 1640 she sailed from France to Port Royal to marry de la Tour. They settled at Fort la Tour at the mouth of the Saint John River. Jacquelin quickly became involved in the Acadian Civil War, her husband's struggle with Charles de Menou d'Aulnay for control of Acadia. She evaded a blockade d'Aulnay had established and returned to France to plead her husband's case to the king. She returned to Acadia with a warship laden with supplies for Fort la Tour. In 1645, while la Tour was in Boston, d'Aulnay attacked the fort. Jacquelin assumed command of the garrison there, refused to surrender, and led a pitched three-day battle to defend the fort. On the fourth day, with the walls of the fort breached and having taken heavy casualties, Jacquelin surrendered. D'Aulnay executed the surviving soldiers. Madame de La Tour was forced to watch the hangings. She died three weeks later.

He previously played for the Tampa Bay Rays, Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, and San Francisco Giants, and was an MLB All-Star in 2015 and 2016. He was selected by Tampa Bay in the 12th round of the 2007 MLB draft. Vogt spent six years in minor leagues in Tampa Bay, and was named the franchise's Minor League Player of the Year in 2011, before debuting with the Rays in 2012 at age 27. He started his major league career with a streak of 32 consecutive at-bats without a hit, which set a Tampa Bay record and lasted into his debut with Oakland in 2013. That year, he started all three games of the 2013 American League Division Series, and hit a game-winning single in Game 2. Vogt led American League catchers in most offensive categories for the first half of his 2015 season, and his .277 batting average in 2016 was ranked in the top five among catchers heading into the All-Star break that year. Vogt left Oakland in 2017 with a batting average of .255 with 49 home runs and 198 runs batted in over 458 games. Vogt joined the Brewers in 2017, playing one injury- shortened season with the team and finishing with a .254 batting average, his highest since 2015. After missing more than a year due to a 2018 shoulder injury, he joined the Giants, his childhood favorite team. His finished 2019 in San Francisco with some of the best offensive numbers of his career, including a .263 batting average, his highest since 2014. Vogt signed a one- year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks in November 2019. In 2014, Oakland fans coined for him the chant \\"I believe in Stephen Vogt!\\" Vogt won the Catfish Hunter Award for being the Athletics's most inspirational player for three consecutive years, and the Dave Stewart Community Service Award for two straight years. Vogt played college baseball at Azusa Pacific University, where he was a two-time All-American selection and set multiple school records. Early life Stephen Vogt was born on November 1, 1984, in Visalia, California. He was one of two boys born to Randy and Toni Vogt, along with his older brother Danny. Randy Vogt was an accountant, and Toni Vogt was the owner and president of the PRISM Weight Loss Program. Stephen Vogt was born into a baseball family: his father had been a pitcher at Fresno State, and two of his uncles played at University of California, Davis, including Mike Vogt, a member of the UC Davis Aggies All-Time Century Team. Stephen began playing tee-ball at age four, and Randy coached both Stephen and Danny through Little League and Babe Ruth League. Randy said his son displayed an aptitude for athletics from an unusually early age: \\"I don't know if it was a developmental aspect with him, but Stephen's been playing sports since he can walk.\\" Vogt first became a catcher at age nine, when his coach told the kids to run to whichever position they wanted to play; he originally ran for middle infield, but switched to the catcher position after seeing that none of his teammates had taken it. Vogt's father made his sons participate in at least two sports and two non-athletic activities in school. Vogt played baseball and basketball, joined Associated Student Body, sung in choir, played trumpet and baritone horn through his sophomore year of high school, and participated in plays and musicals all throughout high school. He also performed in church musicals since his youth, and dreamed of performing on Broadway if he could not have a career in baseball. Vogt grew up a fan of the San Francisco Giants, the favorite team of his father and grandfather; Vogt's favorite players as a child were Will Clark and Barry Bonds, and he also admired Marvin Benard and his underdog story. His family would drive to San Francisco several times a year for Giants games, and they attended the final game at Candlestick Park in 2000, the franchise's first game at Pacific Bell Park, and every game of the 2002 World Series at Pac Bell Park. Vogt attended Central Valley Christian Schools (CVC), where his father Randy was the coach of the school's baseball team, the Cavaliers. Randy had been coach of the team since 1998, when Vogt was in seventh grade and was the team's batboy. When Vogt reached high school, he played for the team himself, and during his four years there set CIF Central Section records for career walks (79) and consecutive steals (65), and second-best career marks for hits (160) and runs (147). In 2003 he was named the East Sierra League Most Valuable Player. Vogt graduated CVC in 2003, and as his senior year was concluding he received little interest from prospective college baseball teams, which he attributed in part to the small size of his school. He dreamed of playing baseball at Fresno State, where his father played, but the school did not recruit him. Vogt took part in showcases being put on by Baseball Factory, Inc., a specialist company in player development and college placement for baseball players, and during one of those showcases he was noticed by a recruiting coach from Azusa Pacific University, a small college in Azusa, California. The recruiting coach provided Azusa Pacific coach Paul Svagdis a tape of Vogt, and after watching Vogt take just three swings, Svagdis knew he wanted him on the team and contacted Vogt to recruit him. Collegiate career Vogt played as catcher for the Azusa Pacific Cougars baseball team for four years. During his time there, his brother Danny was playing baseball for Westmont College, which meant the two occasionally played against each other. In Vogt's freshman season, Vogt had a .431 batting average with six home runs, 20 doubles, 41 runs, and 49 runs batted in (RBIs), and had a 30-game hitting streak, which fell just two games short of the school record. Vogt was selected for an National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) All-American Honorable Mention for the season. In his sophomore year, through April 1, 2005, he was leading the Golden State Athletic Conference with a .422 batting average, and had a team- best 11 doubles, one home run, and 20 RBIs. In May 2005, Vogt was named the Golden State Athletic Conference Player of the Year, the first Cougar to receive the honor. He batted .453 on the season with 67 hits, and finished in the top five in the conference RBIs, doubles, triples, and total bases. He also had 46 walks against 15 strikeouts and an on-base percentage of .582, with a 84-game streak of reaching base safely. Vogt ranked third on the team with a .975 fielding percentage for the season, and threw out 14 of 39 base- stealers. In his junior year, Vogt had a .404 batting average by April 14, 2006, that ranked fourth in the Golden State Athletic Conference. In his senior year, Vogt had 14 home runs, 70 RBIs, 108 hits, 26 doubles, and a .476 batting average, which was one point short of the school record set by Jim Phillips in 1962. Vogt's senior year performance helped the Cougars achieve a No. 2 national ranking in baseball and the No. 1 seed in the NAIA World Series. Vogt hit higher than .400 each of his four seasons at Azusa Pacific. and had an average batting record of .448 across all four seasons. By the end of his collegiate baseball career, Vogt had been a two-time NAIA All-American selection, and set 10 school records, including single-season school records for hits (108) and doubles (26), as well as career school records for hits (294), doubles (74), total bases (471), RBIs (199), walks (163), and batting average (.448). Tampa Bay Rays Minor leagues The Tampa Bay Rays selected Vogt in the 12th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft, with the 365th overall selection. He spent the first few years of his minor league career in the Class A divisions of the Rays organization, starting with the Hudson Valley Renegades of the short-season New York‚ÄìPenn League. He recorded his first professional hit during his 14th at-bat for the team, playing against the Brooklyn Cyclones. Vogt initially struggled in his transition to the pros, hitting .173 through 17 games as of July 13, 2007, with one home run and a team second-best nine RBIs. However, by the end of the season, Vogt had a batting average higher than .300. In 2008, Vogt played for the Columbus Catfish of the South Atlantic League, where he hit .383 in 42 games from June 27 to August 22, with 31 RBIs and a .427 on-base percentage. By the end of the season, he had a .291 batting average, with 22 doubles and four home runs. Vogt joined the Charlotte Stone Crabs of the Florida State League (FSL) in 2009 as a catcher and designated hitter, but appeared in only 10 games before seriously injuring his shoulder. While running to home plate during a game, he slid headfirst and tore the labrum in his left shoulder, which required season-ending surgery in May 2009. Vogt never played in the catcher position during the season, and was unable to throw or hit for eight months after the injury, which many feared could be a career-ender. Vogt requested to stay on with the team for the rest of the season, providing encouragement and support without playing as Charlotte advanced to the FSL championship series in September. As Vogt worked to rehabilitate his shoulder at his home near Seattle during his offseason, Vogt repeatedly questioned whether he should continue pursuing a baseball career, particularly when his recovery suffered a setback in January 2010. He considered retiring as a player and asking the Tampa Bay scouting director for a job in coaching, but on multiple occasions, his wife Alyssa encouraged him not to quit. Vogt made it onto Charlotte's opening day roster in 2010, but the team staff did not believe he was fully ready to return, so he was assigned to be a third-string catcher. Despite getting limited playing time due to his spot on the depth chart, Vogt was named Player of the Month for the entire Rays organization after a May that included a .404 batting average and 10 RBIs. Vogt still recorded a 17-game hitting streak, which was a franchise high, and made the Class A Florida State League All-Star team, despite having only 80 at-bats. Vogt played in 106 games as a catcher, first baseman, and outfielder for Charlotte in 2010. He finished the season with a career-high .345 batting average, the third-highest all-time by a Rays minor league player. Vogt led the league with a .511 slugging percentage and .910 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS), ranked second for on-base percentage (.399), and ranked sixth in doubles (31), and won the Florida State League batting title. He also won the Rays' 2010 Erik Walker Community Champion Award, which honors a minor league player who exemplifies teamwork, sportsmanship, and community involvement. During the off-season, Vogt played winter baseball to help return to hitting form after his limited at-bats with Charlotte. He could not find a spot in one of the premier winter leagues, however, so he played in the Colombian Professional Baseball League, an unusual move for an American player. Vogt enjoyed the experience, but the league ran out of money and Vogt concluded the season a month earlier than expected. Heading into the 2011 minor league season, Baseball America ranked Vogt #30 on its list of the Rays top 30 prospects, prior to a trade that brought Chris Archer, Hak-Ju Lee, Brandon Guyer and Robinson Chirinos to the Rays; after that trade, Vogt dropped off Baseball Americas ranking altogether. Vogt was invited to take part in major league spring training for the Rays, marking his first major league invite to camp, at age 26. He was cut and sent down to the minor leagues in March, starting off with the Double-A Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League, marking Vogt's first time playing above the Class A level. By May 19, Vogt was on an eight-game hitting streak and was batting .325, with seven homers and 33 RBIs, the third-best in the league. He also ranked second in the league in total bases, and third in slugging percentage. Vogt received midseason and postseason Southern League All-Star honors for his play in Montgomery. On July 28, 2011, Vogt was called up to the Durham Bulls, a Triple-A team in the International League, after having recorded 85 RBIs in 97 games for Montgomery, the second-highest of any Southern League player. Vogt played in his first Triple-A game on July 29, batting 2 for 4 against the Gwinnett Braves, during which he was the only Durham player with more than one hit. On August 19, Vogt made his 15th RBI with Durham, which combined with his 85 from Montgomery to bring him to a 100-RBI season for the first time in his career. Vogt batted .301 at Montgomery in 2011, and .290 at Durham. In total between the two teams, Vogt finished the season with a .298 batting average, 35 doubles, 152 hits, seven triples, and 17 home runs, which was just one short of his total of 18 homers across Vogt's previous four seasons combined. He also had 105 RBIs, which led the Rays organization for the season, was the 11th highest total in the minor leagues, and ranked fourth all-time in Rays farm history. Vogt lacked a consistent position in 2011: in 128 total games, he was a catcher in 50, playing other games as a first baseman or outfielder. Vogt was named Tampa Bay's Minor League Player of the Year for 2011. Following the season, Vogt again played winter baseball, this time at the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. During one game while playing left field, a large firecracker was thrown behind him and he was forced to flee. The resulting explosion blew a hole in the ground and singeing his neck, resulting in a suspended game as the police were called. 2012 During spring training for the Rays, Vogt was batting .323 through April 3, and was awarded the Al Lopez Award, given to the team's top rookie in spring training. Due to his lack of experience at the catcher position, Vogt was initially planned to be sent back to the minor leagues, but was a last-minute addition to Tampa Bay's opening day roster, in part due to injuries to Rays players B. J. Upton and Sam Fuld. Vogt was 27 when he was first called up to the major leagues. He was the third catcher on the roster behind Jos√© Molina and Jos√© Lobat√≥n, and the team planned to use Vogt as a pinch hitter and utility player, primarily in left field but also occasionally at first base and catcher. Vogt made his major league debut on April 6, 2012, against the New York Yankees, and struck out in his first at- bat against Yankees pitcher David Robertson. Vogt failed to record a hit in his first 13 at-bats, a franchise record for a Rays player at the start of his career; the previous record was 12, held by pitcher Jeff Niemann. Vogt was sent back down to the Durham Bulls on April 20, in part because Upton had returned from his injury. Vogt was briefly recalled on May 14 due to a knee injury to Desmond Jennings, and Vogt's major league hitless streak stretched to 17 total at-bats, extending the franchise record. He was sent down to Durham again on May 29 to make room on the Rays roster for Hideki Matsui. Vogt initially struggled in his return to Durham, hitting .214 with one home run and 8 RBIs in 19 games through May 13. But his numbers soon improved, including a season-high hitting streak of eight games May 31 to June 7. Vogt recorded a .364 batting average for the month of June, and was named Tampa Bay's top minor league player of the month. Vogt also had a 27-game on-base streak from May 31 to June 30, and then another on-base streak of 12 games from July 13 to 25. Vogt also had doubles in four straight games from August 15 to 18, and collected his 300th career minor league RBI with a single on August 24 against the Norfolk Tides. Vogt finished the 2012 Durham Bulls season with a .272 batting average, 43 RBIs, and nine home runs. Vogt played 37 Durham games in 2012 as a catcher and 35 as an outfielder, as well as games at other positions like first base. By the end of 2012, his minor league career batting average was .299, in nearly 1,900 at-bats. Vogt was called back up to the Tampa Bay Rays on September 5 after Durham's season ended. He played in his first major league game at the catcher position on September 23 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Vogt recorded zero hits in 25 total at-bats for the Rays in 2012, making him the first American League position player, and one of four players overall, to go hitless for the season with at least 25 at-bats. Across three separate stints with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2012, Vogt played in 18 games, as an outfielder, catcher, and first baseman. Rays scouts and coaching staff believed Vogt needed some work defensively, so he lifted weights and began practicing yoga to improve in this area. Oakland Athletics 2013 The Tampa Bay Rays designated Vogt for assignment on March 31, 2013; he and his family were driving to Durham in anticipation of Vogt playing for the Bulls when he was called with the news. On April 5, he was traded for cash to the Oakland Athletics, who bought his contract for $150,000. Oakland assigned Vogt to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League, where Vogt debuted on April 7, going 3 for 4 in hits including a home run and two doubles. He embarked on a 13-game hit streak, which was a team-high, highlighted by an April 14 game against the Reno Aces in which Vogt hit 5 for 6 and recorded four runs, six RBIs, and two home runs, one of which was a grand slam. Through April 20, Vogt led the Pacific Coast League in hitting (.529), on-base percentage (.579) and slugging percentage (1.000), and he had multiple hits in 10 of his first 14 games with Sacramento. By April 28, Vogt had a league-leading batting average of .457, as well as five home runs and 18 RBIs. Unlike the previous season, Vogt was an everyday catcher for the River Cats, starting in the position six out of every seven games, and as of May 7, the team was 15‚Äì5 when Vogt played as catcher, and 2‚Äì9 when he did not. Vogt was called up to the Oakland A's on June 25. The team was in need of backup because catcher John Jaso suffered an abrasion on his hand, and Derek Norris, also a catcher, was in a hitting slump. At the time of his recall, Vogt was hitting .324 in 58 games with the River Cats, with 13 home runs and 58 RBI, and having thrown out 19 of 47 (40.4%) base-stealers, the third-best ratio in the Pacific Coast League. Having spent six years almost entirely in the minor leagues, Vogt was a rookie at age 28 for the Athletics. In his debut game with Oakland on June 25, Vogt failed to get a hit but did record his first major league RBI, when a fly ball was caught for an out was deep enough to score Josh Donaldson from third base. Vogt started off 0 for 7 in hits for the A's, extending his hitless streak to his first 32 at- bats. though he only struck out twice over that span. It marked the longest hitless streak to start a career by a non-pitcher since Chris Carter went 0 for 33 with the A's in 2010. Vogt got his first hit in the major leagues in his third game with Oakland, on June 28, a home run off a pitch from Joe Kelly of the St. Louis Cardinals, breaking Vogt's 0 for 32 hitless streak. Vogt was returned to Sacramento after about a week at Oakland in the catcher position, during which time the Athletics won all four games, and Vogt recorded 2 hits in 13 at-bats. Vogt before a game for the Oakland Athletics on August 21, 2013, against the Seattle Mariners. Through July 22, Vogt was batting .325 with 12 home runs and 57 RBI in Sacramento, having played a career-high 71 games as catcher. He was named the Pacific Coast League player of the week on July 23, which capped a week in which he had four home runs in six games. Vogt was called back up to Oakland again on July 25 after Juso was placed on the disabled list due to a concussion. Jaso did not return for the season, leaving Vogt the sole left-handed-hitting catcher on the roster, sharing playing time with right-handed Derek Norris and Kurt Suzuki. The A's won the next four games with Vogt catching, making a total of eight consecutive wins in the first games with Vogt as catcher. Vogt hit his first career major league triple on August 31 in a 2‚Äì1 win over his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays.h In the month of August, Vogt batted .328 over 56 at-bats. He finished September hitting 4 for 26 in his final 10 regular season games in September. In total, Vogt had a .252 batting average with four home runs in the 2013 regular season, as well as 16 RBIs, having appeared in 45 regular season games, and 135 at-bats. The Athletics were 27‚Äì13 in games that Vogt started. Vogt started in all five games of the 2013 American League Division Series, catching all but two postseason innings for the A's in their series with the Detroit Tigers. Although Vogt finished the regular season with a hitting slump, Oakland manager Bob Melvin started him in the ALDS because Vogt played well against Detroit during their series in August, when he played three of the four games and batted 4 for 11, with at least one hit in each game. Vogt led the Athletics to a win in Game 2 of the ALDS with a bases-loaded walk-off single in the ninth inning, off pitcher Rick Porcello.> It was Vogt's first career game-winning hit in the major leagues, and the first walk-off RBI in Major League Baseball postseason history by a rookie catcher. In Game 3 of the series, Vogt hit a triple off An√≠bal S√°nchez, and scored on Coco Crisp's sacrifice fly ball. Detroit ultimately won the series in five games. 2014 Vogt posted strong numbers during the 2014 spring training, with a .357 batting average through March 25, as well as three home runs and 12 RBIs, both of which were tied for the team lead. However, he did not make the opening day roster, as the presence of Jaso and Norris meant the team did not need another catcher. Melvin called one of the decision one of the hardest cuts he ever had to make. Vogt returned to the Sacramento River Cats, where he was considered a leader on the team. On April 8, Vogt suffered a strained oblique muscle and missed several weeks; he was re-activated on May 12, after missing 30 games. Vogt had a 10-game hitting streak through May 28, over which he had seven multi-hit games. Vogt was recalled to Oakland on June 1, after having hit .364 in Sacramento in 2014, with three home runs and 19 RBIs in 21 games. Vogt hit his first home run of the season on June 11, a two-run homer against Jered Weaver of the Los Angeles Angels./ On June 22, Vogt made his first career appearance at first base in the major leagues when he was moved to the position in the top of the ninth inning against the Boston Red Sox. Vogt started 13 games in right field in 2014, and fans in the stands near him during those games began a \\"I believe in Stephen Vogt!\\" chant, which was modeled after the United States men's national soccer team chant \\"I believe that we will win!\\". The chant became widespread, with the Athletics even selling T-shirts and merchandise with the catchphrase in team stores throughout O.co Coliseum. After suffering a bad bone bruise on his right foot, Vogt was unable to play in the catcher position in any games after July 7./ As of that date, Vogt had appeared in 31 games for the Athletics, with a hit in 24 of them. He had a career-best 12-game hitting streak from June 30 to July 12, which included six multi-hit games. As of July 31, Vogt was batting .351, and had played nearly every day in June and July, appearing in a variety of positions including catcher, outfield, and first base. Vogt entered into a hitting slump, recording 0 hits on 23 at-bats from July 29 to August 6, but he ended the drought with a home run on August 7, after which he had five hits in four games. After already having played with a right foot injury for about two months, Vogt sprained his left ankle during a September 3 game when he slid into second base, breaking up a double play. Vogt was out from September 3 to 17, and was limited to first base upon his return. Vogt ultimately only caught 15 games in 2014. By September 20, Vogt was leading the team in batting average with .298. By the end of the season, Vogt played in a career-high 84 games, marking the first time Vogt had played more than 47 games in a major league season. He ended the year with a .279 batting average, 35 RBIs, nine home runs, and 75 hits Vogt was the 2014 recipient of Oakland's annual Catfish Hunter Award, presented to the team's most inspirational player in recognition of contributions on and off the field. The award is voted on by A's players. Vogt required foot surgery after the season concluded, to repair a ruptured plantar plate, which took about five months to heal. 2015 With Oakland trading John Jaso and Derek Norris during the offseason, Vogt became the starting catcher for the Athletics heading into 2015. The team traded for catcher Josh Phegley, and initially planned for Vogt and Phegley to be in a platoon together, but Vogt quickly earned the clear starting role, marking his first full-time opportunity at the catcher position. During the offseason, Vogt made an adjusment to his hitting approach at the direction of hitting coach Darren Bush, placing a greater emphasis on making low, hard contact; Vogt credited this with helping make him a better big-league player. Having recovered from offseason foot surgery, Vogt started on opening day with no restrictions. Vogt hit a three-run home run against the Texas Rangers during the Athletics' season opener on April 6. On April 17, Vogt hit two home runs against the Kansas City Royals, his first multi-homer game.

He hit his first career grand slam on May 4 against Minnesota Twins pitcher Phil Hughes, which also marked his third home run in three consecutive at-bats. Through May 13, Vogt was leading the American League in RBIs (30), was ranked second in OPS (1.098), and had nine home runs, which matched both his career-high and his season total from the previous year. He also had only 5 fewer RBIs than he had in 84 games in 2014. By May 16, he had the America League's ninth-highest batting average at .337, and his slugging percentage of .598 was the league's third-highest as of May 26.

He also led all catchers with 18 doubles. Vogt was selected for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, marking his second consecutive appearance. He was Oakland's sole All-Star representative for 2016, and he was the first Athletics non-pitcher named to consecutive All-Star teams since Jason Giambi in 2000 and 2001.

On June 22, Oafkland designated Vogt for assignment. He was the second-longest-tenured Athletic at the time he was cut. During his five seasons with the Oakland A's, Vogt had a slash line of .255/.316/.416, with 49 home runs, and 198 RBIs, in 458 games. In his combined time with Oakland and the Tampa Bay Rays over six seasons, had a career .251/.312/.409 slash line. There was a great deal of disappointment on the Oakland roster after Vogt was cut; pitcher Sean Doolittle called him \\"the unquestioned captain of the team\\", and Josh Reddick said it was \\"hard to imagine a clubhouse without him\\". Milwaukee Brewers 2017 On June 25, 2017, Vogt was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers, where he was planned to play in a timeshare with catcher Manny Pi√±a. Through his first 12 games for Milwaukee, he was hitting .250 with four home runs and nine RBIs, which combined with his 2007 games in Oakland brought his numbers to a .222 batting average, eight home runs, and 29 RBIs. On July 17, Vogt was injured when Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Chad Kuhl collided with him while running for home. Vogt's left leg bent backwards during the collision, and he suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in his knee, forcing him to miss about a month. Vogt had a rehabilitation assignment with Milwaukee's Triple-A affiliate Colorado Springs Sky Sox in August before rejoining the Brewers. He returned to the team on August 18, where he played wearing a protective brace on his knee and doubled in his only at-bat. By September 4, Vogt was batting .317 with five home runs and 11 RBI over 23 games, including a .412 average in the last week of that span. On September 29, Vogt had a home run and three RBIs in a 5‚Äì3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals that helped keep Milwaukee's playoff hopes alive. Vogt's game on September 30 would be his last in the major leagues for more than a year. He finished 2017 with a .254 batting average for the Brewers, his highest since his 2015 All-Star season. Vogt also had eight home runs, 20 RBIs, and a .508 slugging percentage, in 45 games for Milwaukee, over 129 at-bats. Including his time in both Oakland and Milwaukee, Vogt had a 2017 batting average of .233, with 12 home runs, 40 RBIs, and a .285 on-base percentage, his lowest since his major league debut season in 2012. Vogt threw out just three of 66 runners in stolen base attempts in total during his time in Oakland and Milwaukee in 2017, including just one of 28 during his time with the Brewers. 2018 The Brewers re- signed Vogt in 2018, again planning for him to split time with Pi√±a. Vogt agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract of $3,065,000, which he signed to avoid salary arbitration and a possible non-tender. During the offseason, Vogt worked on improving his throwing motion, adjusting his arm slot, and further strengthening his arm to improve his defense behind the plate. However, Vogt ended up playing in only three spring training games for the Brewers for the entire year. He hurt his right shoulder during a spring training workout, and when the discomfort lingered, it was later discovered to be a strained capsule. After being sidelined for several months, Vogt began a rehabilitation assignment with Milwaukee's Double-A affiliate Biloxi Shuckers on May 2, hitting a solo home run in his first game. On May 5, when he was one day away from returning to the Brewers, Vogt reinjured the shoulder making a throw to third base, while trying to throw out Cade Gotta of the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp during a stolen base attempt. Vogt damaged his rotator cuff, labrum, and capsule, which required season-ending surgery. The surgery took place on May 17. and due in part to his age of 33 at the time of the surgery, doubts were raised as to whether he would ever play again. Though Vogt never played a major league game in 2018, he opted to travel with the Brewers, supporting the players and assisting the coaching staff, in what Vogt described his as a \\"weird hybrid of player-coach\\". On November 1, Vogt elected to enter free agency, and departed from the Brewers after clearing waivers. San Francisco Giants (2019) Vogt held a workout for interested teams on January 31, 2019, which was attended by five teams, including the San Francisco Giants. On February 10, Vogt agreed to a minor-league deal with the Giants, his favorite team during his childhood. Vogt said: \\"It's been a lifelong dream of mine to play for the Giants. It's going to come true this year.\\" The Giants wanted Vogt to take pressure off catcher Buster Posey as he recovered from right hip surgery; the team also wanted Vogt to provide some competition for young Giants backup option Aramis Garcia. Vogt did not make the opening day roster, instead starting in the minor leagues to get more repetitions and help rebuild his arm strength. This marked Vogt's third tour with the Sacramento River Cats (which had been Oakland's Triple-A affiliate until 2015), and his first since 2014. In 72 at-bats for Sacramento in 2019, Vogt had a slash line of .241/.389/.500, with three doubles, four home runs, and seven RBI. as well as an .889 on-base plus slugging (OPS). Vogt was called up to San Francisco on May 1, making his return to the major leagues less than a year after his shoulder surgery. On May 3, Vogt appeared in his first major league game since the shoulder injury, in which he pinch hit against the Cincinnati Reds. He recorded three hits, two RBIs, and a game-tying home run, marking his first three-hit game since September 26, 2017, and his first major league home run since September 29, 2017. Vogt batted .467 in his first six games with San Francisco from May 3 to 10. He hit two triples against the Brewers on June 15, his only triples of the season. He was the first Giants catcher to record two triples in one game since Steve Nicosia in 1984, and just the third catcher from any team to do so in the previous eight years; it also marked the first two-triple game from any Giants player in three years. By June 17, Vogt was hitting .264 with a .783 OPS, which was among the best offense numbers for catchers on the season. Those numbers improved even further following the All- Star break, when Vogt was hitting .357 with a 1.223 OPS in 14 games between July 13 and 27. In his first 53 games of the season through July 22, Vogt had a .262 batting average, his highest since 2014, as well as career-highs in OPS (.844) and slugging percentage (.508). On August 9, Vogt hit a two-run home run 423 feet out of Oracle Park into McCovey Cove, the 79th \\"splash hit\\" by a Giant in the history of the park; he was the first Giant to hit one since Brandon Belt on May 15, 2018. Vogt hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning in a game against the Oakland A's on August 24, his first game played at Oakland Coliseum since leaving the team. By the end of August, Vogt was considered a front-runner for the Willie Mac Award, which is presented annually to the most inspirational player on the Giants. Late in the season, with Posey still struggling, Vogt was called to play more often than originally planned, with his backup position turning into more of a timeshare. On September 17, Vogt caught all 294 pitches thrown in a 5-hour 54-minute game that lasted 15 innings against the Boston Red Sox, during which a franchise- record 13 pitchers were used. Vogt finished the season with some of his best offensive numbers of his career, posting a .263/.314/.490 slash line, with 10 home runs and 40 RBI, across 99 games and 255 at-bats. Vogt's batting average was his highest since 2014, and he posted new career highs in slugging percentage (.490) and OPS (.804). However, he threw out only six of 35 base- stealers (17%) for the year, and had the slowest poptime (2.14) among the year's major league catchers, meaning the amount of time between when a pitch hits a catcher's glove to when it reaches the glove of the middle infielder at second base. During the off-season, Vogt said he wanted to play for a team that could compete for the World Series, which was interpreted as a sign he would not remain with the Giants. Vogt entered into free agency in November. Arizona Diamondbacks (2019‚Äì) On November 26, 2019, Vogt signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Personal life Vogt is married to Alyssa Vogt (n√©e Ferdaszewski). They met when both were attending Azusa Pacific University, where Alyssa was a standout on the college basketball team, playing in all five positions and scoring more than 1,000 points from 2004 to 2007. A 2003 graduate of Capital High School in Olympia, Washington, Alyssa has coached girls' basketball at Evergreen State College in Olympia, and the Tumwater High School in Tumwater, Washington. Stephen and Alyssa Vogt have three children: a daughter named Payton and two sons named Clark and Bennett. Payton was born in 2011, Clark in 2014, and Bennett in 2016. The family has previously lived in Olympia, Tumwater, and Oakland. Vogt's mother Toni died in July 2016. Stephen and Alyssa Vogt support the School of Imagination in Dublin, California, which offers services and support systems to children, including those with special needs, disabilities, and developmental disorders like autism. The couple have made multiple visits to work with autistic and special needs children there. In November 2016, Vogt received a 2016 Threads of Hope Award from Diablo Magazine for his work with the School of Imagination; the magazine described Vogt and the other winners as \\"exceptional volunteers who give their time to charitable causes in the East Bay\\". Vogt has been considered a favorite among both fans, who saw him as an underdog and everyman. He was also popular among teammates on each team with which he has played, and is well known for his sense of humor. He won the Tampa Bay Rays talent show in both 2009 and 2010, eventually becoming emcee of the shows, and in March 2019 he was voted one of the funniest teammates on the San Francisco Giants in a poll of players. He is well known for his impressions of various people, including baseball manager Joe Maddon, a basketball referee, and Matt Foley, the motivational speaker character portrayed by Chris Farley on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live. Farley was Vogt's favorite actor and the person who inspired him to start doing impressions, and Vogt delivered a speech to the Oakland players at the start of the 2015 season as Matt Foley. An interview Vogt delivered as Matt Foley interview in 2015 won him an Esurance MLB Award for Best Interview, and he also performed his basketball referee impression on the MLB Network talk show Intentional Talk, which generated a great deal of viral Internet attention, and led to the creation of a Vogt referee bobblehead with sound. Vogt has aspirations to be a manager in major league baseball one day. He has a superstitious habit of getting dressed in a specific sequence each day, including how he pulls on his socks and in what order. Vogt enjoys musicals, and his favorite is The Phantom of the Opera. He is a fan of the television series Saved by the Bell and the heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine, and has described actress Jessica Biel as his \\"celebrity crush\\". Vogt is afraid of spiders.

It has a period of about 12 years, with the SST anomalies manifesting their most pronounced features around 10‚Äì15 degrees of latitude off of the Equator.Chang et al., A decadal climate variation in the tropical Atlantic Ocean from thermodynamic air-sea interactions, Nature Vol. 385 , 1997 The term Tropical Atlantic SST dipole is only one of the characteristic names used to refer to this mode of variability; other definitions include the interhemispheric SST gradient or the Meridional Atlantic mode. This decadal-scale SST pattern constitutes one of the key features of SST variability in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, with another one being the Atlantic Equatorial Mode or Atlantic Ni√±o, which occurs in the zonal (east-west) direction at interannual timescales, with sea surface temperature and heat content anomalies being observed in the eastern equatorial basin.A.D. Moura and J. Shukla,On the Dynamics of Droughts in Northeast Brazil: Observations, Theory and Numerical Experiments with a General Circulation Model, Journal of the Atmospheric Science, Vol. 38, 1981 Its importance in climate dynamics and decadal-scale climate prediction is evident when investigating its impact on adjacent continental regions such as the Northeast Brazil, the Sahel as well as its influence on North Atlantic cyclogenesis. Structure and key features of the interhemispheric SST dipole Early studies have focused their attention on the connection between the enhancement (decrease) of tropical rainfall in regions such as the Northeast Brazil, the Western Sub-Saharan Africa etc. and perturbations in the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (Moura and Shukla (1981), Nobre and Shukla (1996).) Such research efforts have concentrated on the role of the interhemispheric (meridional) SST mode as a dynamical driver of the tropical Atlantic overlying atmosphere, by analyzing perturbations of this coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere system while examining local as well as remote influences (i.e. the tropical -mid-latitude N. Atlantic connection (Tanimoto and Xie (1999), Tourre et al. (1999)), the tropical Pacific influence via El Nino/La Nina events (Enfield and Mayer (1997)). Other studies, however, such as the ones carried out by Houghton and Tourre (1992) and Enfield and Mayer (1997), have questioned the very existence of this interhemispheric gradient (or SST dipole) as a statistical mode of climate variability. These studies suggest that the principal component analysis used to analyze the tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) and extract these statistical SST modes imposes a constraint on the analysis (due to the requirement of the orthogonality of the principal components that are associated with the different SST modes), without which the connection between the SST anomaly patterns in the Northern and Southern hemispheres appears to be insignificant. Ruiz-Barradas et al. (2001) proposed that the aforementioned controversy potentially exists due to the fact that most of the previously- cited studies have attempted to identify tropical Atlantic SST patterns of variability based solely on ocean data, instead of making use of a combined analysis of observed or modeled perturbations in both the ocean and the atmosphere. Following such an additive approach, Ruiz-Barradas et al.Ruiz- Barradas et al., Structure of Interannual-to-Decadal Climate Variability in the Tropical Atlantic Sector, Journal of Climate, Vol. 13, 2000 noted that a positive Northern Hemisphere (NH) SST anomaly is associated with a northward, wind-stress anomaly and a subsequent cyclonic (counterclockwise) circulation in the subtropics, which interferes with the background flow easterlies; the opposite is true for the southern hemisphere, where the wind stress anomaly acts to enhance the south-easterlies. Such interference with the background flow subsequently leads to a decrease (enhancement) of the heat fluxes from the ocean toward the atmosphere and therefore an intensification of the positive(negative) SST anomalies, in the warm (cool) hemisphere. Other discernible features of the interhemispheric dipole noted in the aforementioned study, include a strengthened, anomalous downwelling in the hemisphere that is characterized by positive SST anomalies and a respective, less prevalent upwelling in the negative SST anomalies-hemisphere. Furthermore, diabatic heating perturbations are also shown to be linked to cross-equatorial SST changes, with positive anomalies being observed over the warmer Northern hemisphere waters and negative ones over the Southern hemisphere. A strong connection is also found between the tropical Atlantic SST dipole and the overlying atmosphere; enhanced convective patterns and anomalous precipitation appear correlated with warm NH SSTs, whereas the opposite phase is observed across the equator, over the cooler SH waters. Finally, a connection is discerned between the surface and sub-surface interhemispheric pattern-related SSTs. Northern SST anomalies appear to permeate vertically below the ocean surface reaching thermocline (THC) depths and inciting in this way THC anomalies of up to 3m.Ruiz-Barradas et al. Structure of Interannual-to-Decadal Climate Variability in the Tropical Atlantic Sector, Journal of Climate, Vol. 13, 2000 This provides additional evidence of the critical role of surface ocean currents in transporting warm waters and heat meridionally, since surface wind-induced Ekman pumping appears to be the key contributor for such THC and heat content anomalies. Seasonal dependence The meridional (interhemispheric) mode demonstrates seasonal changes, arriving to a maximum during the boreal spring, on and north of the equator. The seasonal changes in surface wind forcing, which are closely linked to the seasonal displacement of the ITCZ, incite a response on the ocean surface, affecting current systems in the tropical Atlantic as well as the slope of the underlying thermocline (THC). For example, during the Southern hemisphere spring and summer months (November‚ÄìApril), when the south trade winds are weak and the ITCZ is displaced further to the south, there is enhanced flow to the north along the coast of South America via the North Brazil Current (NBO); this helps transport additional heat further to the north. The Atlantic ITCZ is very sensitive to even small changes in the interhemispheric SST gradient due to the fact that tropical SSTs are very uniform in magnitude throughout the equatorial region between -. Therefore, even a small change in the SST field can cause a significant impact on the position and displacement of the ITCZ. Such shifts, along with the associated development of the equatorial cold tongue, are features of the seasonal climate that are essential to the formation and evolution of the interannual and decadal tropical Atlantic variability (TAV).S.P. Xie and J. Carton, Tropical Atlantic Variability: Patterns, Mechanisms, and Impacts, Geophysical Monograph, AGU, Washington, D.C., 2004 A strong seasonality is also observed with respect to the remote, North Pacific influence in the tropical Atlantic, via ENSO events that induce western equatorial wind stress anomalies (WEA), which in return modulate the tropical Atlantic Ocean-atmosphere dynamics.M. Mu Ãànnich and J. D. Neelin, Seasonal influence of ENSO on the Atlantic ITCZ and equatorial South America, Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 32, 2005 During an ENSO warm event, the sea level pressure is lower than normal over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and greater than normal over the tropical Atlantic. This leads to a diminished, meridional pressure gradient in both basins, consistent with a reduction in the background easterly wind flow. The decrease of meridional pressure gradient is enhanced by a low pressure center that develops during the boreal winter over the southwestern N. Atlantic, resulting, thus, to a lagged (by about one season with respect to the tropical Pacific SST maximum) maximum warming of the northern hemisphere tropical Atlantic during the boreal spring.A. Giannini et al. , The ENSO Teleconnection to the Tropical Atlantic Ocean: Contributions of the Remote and Local SSTs to Rainfall Variability in the Tropical Americas, Journal of Climate, Vol. 14, 2001 Impacts Northeastern Brazil is one of the key regions that are severely affected by the meridional mode of tropical Atlantic SST variability. More specifically, an anomalous displacement of the ITCZ toward the north (south) leads to anomalous rainfall patterns and thus significant drying (wetting) over NE Brazil; this is also associated with a pattern of anomalous warm (cold) SST in the northern tropical Atlantic and with directly opposite conditions across the southern tropical Atlantic.Jacques Servain et al., Modes of climatic variability in the tropical Atlantic ,IAHS Publ. no. 252, 1998. (http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl- doc/pleins_textes/divers09-04/010017928.pdf) Similarly, the Tropical Atlantic SST dipole is shown to impact the climate of West Saharan Africa, causing major droughts, such as the one in 1914 and during the 1968‚Äì1974 time period. Such extreme events have drastic effects on the land use as well as directly on human life. Other consequences of the Tropical Atlantic SST dipole include modulation of the strength and frequency of the Atlantic hurricanes via a series of mechanisms: a. enhancement of easterly wave propagation during the positive phase of the SST dipole (associated with a wetter West Saharan Africa and increased convective activity which in retrospect promotes a greater N. Atlantic hurricane activity), b. influence on moist static stability and vertical wind shear, c. modulation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) by changing the subtropical surface pressure patterns, and thus affecting tropical- extratropical, ocean-atmosphere processes that are vital for the development or the weakening of North Atlantic hurricanes.L.

It was first noted over the central North Atlantic Ocean by the Met Office. It then later reached peak intensity just northwest of Ireland and then crossed the north of Scotland hours later. It hung around the coast of Norway for the next week before being absorbed by another strong windstorm named Joachim. Hergen was not the first storm to strike Western Europe during the last week as Cyclone Friedhelm brought widespread damage and very strong winds on 8 December. Hergen was followed by Joachim a few days later, then Oliver/Patrick (Cato/Dagmar) during the Christmas holiday. Cyclone Ulli then brought major damage and flooding to Northern Europe during the early part of January 2012. Meteorological history On 11 December 2011, the Met Office had noted a complex weather system over the central Atlantic, associated with several warm and cold fronts. An amplified jet stream‚Äîa strong and fast-moving airstream aloft‚Äîadvanced eastward, sparking rapid cyclogenesis along the fronts. By the following day, a low-pressure centre had developed along an occlusion between two of the fronts. The low rapidly deepened as it approached the British Isles, with a developing occluded rainband producing sustained winds of up to 60 mph (95 km/h). It later deepened to a minimum barometric pressure of , centred just northwest of Ireland. A wave was recorded off the coast of County Donegal at 1400 UTC on 13 December. On 14 December, Hergen had moved slightly to the northeast while centred just off the coast of the Shetland Isles. By this time, the system had lost its weather fronts. The storm moved slowly offshore Norway for the next few days before being absorbed by the larger Cyclone Joachim on 19 December.  Preparations and warnings  On 10 December, a low pressure system formed over Labrador. This storm rapidly deepened as it moved towards the United Kingdom, which led to the Met Office issuing severe weather warnings. At the time, the forecast storms were considered to be equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm was only expected to strike parts of England and Wales. Forecasters at multiple meteorological agencies in the United Kingdom said that snow could fall in southern England which would have been the first of the season. They also said that winds could reach , however, there was not much confidence with this prediction.  Impact  The low brought strong winds and rain to Hampshire, flooding streets and felling trees. In some areas, the winds reached speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h), just below hurricane force. A tree crashed down onto a home in Winchester, causing heavy damage and almost killing a resident inside. In Kent, the Port of Dover was shut from 10:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. GMT on 11‚Äì12 December. The Scotland transport minister warned of snow and strong winds which could have led to widespread travel disruption. Icy conditions prevailed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Northern England early on 13 December. In Norway, a ferry was delayed by 17.5 hours by the large waves caused by the storm, leaving some injured.

It was followed by a 2013 sequel titled ThanksKilling 3, the $112,248 budget of which was raised through a Kickstarter campaign.  Plot  At the first Thanksgiving in 1621, a topless Pilgrim is slain with a tomahawk wielded by an evil demonic turkey, which quips, \\"Nice tits, bitch!\\" Centuries later, five college students (good girl Kristen, jock Johnny, ditzy Ali, redneck Billy, and nerdy Darren) head home to Crawl Berg (formerly Crawberg) for Thanksgiving with their families. After Kristen calls her father, the local sheriff, the car overheats, forcing the quintet to camp out for the night. As they are setting up, Darren tells the settler-era folktale of Feathercloud, a Native American shaman who was dishonored by hedonistic pilgrim Chuck Langston, one of Billy's ancestors. The outraged Feathercloud used necromancy to create Turkie, who is said to appear every five-hundred and five years to slaughter all Caucasians he encounters. Elsewhere, a dog owned by a hermit named Oscar urinates on a miniature totem pole, desecrating it, and releasing Turkie prematurely and urinating on him as well. Angry, Turkie kills the dog, prompting Oscar to swear vengeance as Turkie runs off, and scares Kristen. Kristen tells the others about her run-in with Turkie, but they laugh off her story, until a baby rabbit (which appears to have been pecked to death) is thrown into their campfire. The next day, Turkie flags down a vehicle, and when the driver sexually propositions him, Turkie responds by shooting the man in the head and hijacking his car. By nightfall, the students reach their respective homes, and while Johnny tries to reconnect with his estranged father, Turkie attacks him. Johnny's parents are killed, but he escapes, and rejoins his friends with the exception of Ali, who is having sex with her boyfriend, Greg. Turkie walks in on the lovers, slits Greg's throat, and rapes Ali before snapping her neck. After finding Ali's remains, the students decide to go to Kristen's house, to see if her father has any books about Turkie in his library. Turkie beats them there, tricking Kristen's father (who is dressed as a turkey for an upcoming pageant) into letting him in by wearing Groucho glasses. As they wait for Kristen, Turkie and the sheriff share an awkward snack, which ends when Turkie murders the sheriff after he mistakes him for a duck. Kristen and her friends arrive, and are allowed in by Turkie, who has donned the sheriff's severed face as a disguise. Darren finds a book about Turkie, and it mentions he can be killed if his magic talisman is removed, though the rest of the passage about how to destroy him is written in code. Billy stumbles onto Turkie disposing of the sheriff's body, and while he and the others succeed in getting the talisman, Turkie gets away. Billy storms off while Darren cracks the code in the book, discovering that Turkie must be burned at the stake after a demonic prayer is said backwards. Outside, Turkie magically enters Billy's body, and shoots his way out. Billy dies in Darren's arms as they reminisce about all the good times they had together. Darren, Kristen, and Johnny track Turkie to his tipi and say the prayer, but as they prepare to burn him he runs outside, and is shot in the head by Oscar. Oscar leaves, and the others go to Kristen's house, unaware that the dumpster Turkie was blasted into contains radioactive waste, which reanimates him. Believing that Turkie is dead, the surviving teens go back to Kristen's house. While Johnny and Kristen admit their feelings for each other, Darren awkwardly goes to the kitchen to get a snack. There, Turkie rips Darren's tongue and heart out, and stabs Johnny with an electric knife. Kristen slaps Turkie and runs to a house like shack. Turkie has chased her, but Kristen sets Turkie on fire with an aerosol flamethrower, and while he burns to death Johnny dies from the electric carver stab. Kristen grabs a pipe and knocks him into a pile of wood. Oscar congratulates her and she eats Turkie's legs. Later, at a family's Thanksgiving dinner, the cooked turkey comes to life, and in Turkie's voice yells, \\"Do I smell sequel, biotch?!\\"  Cast  * Natasha Cordova as Ali * Lindsey Anderson as Kristen Roud * Lance Predmore as Johnny * Aaron Carlson as Billy Langsten * Ryan Francis as Darren * General Bastard as Oscar * Chuck Lamb as Sheriff Roud * Jordan Downey as Turkie's Voice  Production  ThanksKilling was shot on a budget of $3,500 in the summer of 2007, and released on DVD in 2009. Known for almost purposefully bad horror movies, including Critters: Bounty Hunter, and The Head, director Jordan Downey argues that he sets out in production to make these movies from the start. Downey states that early production and brainstorming for the film began at his local Blockbuster as him and his friends started looking at bad movie covers and were just throwing ideas off of each other. The production and writing of the film was claimed to be tackled by merely himself and his close friends as they tackled the budget and jokes, mainly just focusing on what they thought it would be comical for a killer turkey to do. Downey stated he was able to have his distributor get the movie on Netflix before the streaming services explosion in popularity which he believes greatly contributed to the film's success and cult following. Downey also delved deeper into the film's production, and stated how he and his crew taught themselves photoshop, sculpting, and other visual techniques in order to entirely film and produce the movie themselves.  Reception  ThanksKilling was called \\"cheerily awful\\" by Tom Russo of The Boston Globe. Mark Hughes of Forbes stated, \\"It's a comedy-horror movie, but even the humor is awful. But it's so darn awful that it doesn't even need Mystery Science Theater 3000 voice-over jokes to be entertainingly terrible. If you can enjoy laughing at a bad movie, definitely add this one to your list\\". DVD Verdict's Gordon Sullivan responded well to the film, writing, \\"In some ways there's nothing special about ThanksKilling‚Äîit's a typical slasher-style creature-feature where a group of college kids are menaced by a holiday themed killer who spouts one liners. However, ThanksKilling knows how to tickle the low-budget funny bone in particularly effective ways\\" and \\"The film itself is a campy low-budget horror flick that gets in and out in little over an hour, delivering the goods all the while. The extras are a little slight, but overall, this disc should please genre fans\\". In a negative review from The Badger Herald, Peter Culver writes, \\"Ultimately, there‚Äôs not much else to say about this mountainous pile of garbage. There‚Äôs more entertaining bad movies, there‚Äôs better movies about unlikely murderous animals and there‚Äôs better Thanksgiving movies. For your own sake, please just don‚Äôt\\".  Musical adaptation  A musical adaptation of the film, titled ThanksKilling: The Musical, was created by Jeff Thomson, Jordan Mann and David Eck, premiered in Seattle in 2013, and off off-broadway at The Producers Club as part of the Festival of the Offensive in 2014, with Diana Huey, Gabriel Violett, Abe Goldfarb, Marissa Rosen, Jillian Gottlieb, David Errigo Jr., Mike Daly and Evan Woltz, Dad's Garage (Atlanta, GA 2015), Columbus, OH (2016) with Ryan Francis reprising his on-screen roll of Darren, with an additional showing at the 2017 Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival.

The area is to the west bounded by Kalkbr√¶nderihavnsgade, part of a major thoroughfare, and to the east by Dampf√¶rgevej connected to Kalkbr√¶nderihavnsgade in both ends and separating Amerika Plads from America Quay, the western quay of the Southern Free Port dock. The name of the area, like that of the quay, is a reference to the large passenger ships which used to transport Danish emigrants to New York City during the first half of the 20th century. History Dating from circa 1903, the name Dampf√¶rgevej (English: Steam Ferry Road) refers to the steam ferries to Malm√∂ which used to berth on the north side of the area. The Copenhagen-Malm√∂ link was founded as a joined venture between the Swedish and Danish state railways in 1895 in connection with the opening of the new free port in Copenhagen. The Amerika Plads neighbourhood is located in the former steam ferry terrain. The route was discontinued in 1974. In 1986, the premises were taken over by DanLink which operated a cargo line on the route Copenhagen-Helsingborg until 30 June 2000 when it closed due to the opening of the √òresund Bridge. Redevelopment The street lights Due to the area's attractive location on the border between √òsterbro and the City Centre and near some of the most expensive addresses in Copenhagen, it was decided to redevelop the area in the late 1990s. It happened as a joint venture between Port of Copenhagen (now CPH City & Port Development) and private development companies TK Development and Sj√¶ls√∏ Gruppen. In 2000, Port of Copenhagen commissioned Dutch architects West 8 to draw up a masterplan for the transformation of the area. The aim of the plan is to create a dense and active urban environment with multiple functions and diverse architecture. As part of the masterplan, the new buildings all have interior courtyards that are accessible to the public, unlike those in the older parts of the city, so as to expand the street areas and create life and movement between the buildings. The neighbourhood comprises about 50,000 em2 of renovated buildings and 95,000 em2 of new buildings distributed on 53,000 em2 of offices and buildings and about 42,000 em2 of dwellings. The square The former Free Port Station building The square is dominated by the former Free Port Railway Station which was dismantled in 2002 and rebuilt in 2005 to serve as a caf√© pavilion near its original location. The half-timbered National Romantic building from 1895 was designed by Heinrich Wenck, who also designed Copenhagen Central Station and numerous other railway stations around the country, and served as a hub for the Copenhagen-Malm√∂ ferries. Buildings and residents The Nordisk Fjer building Among the older buildings in the area is the former headquarters of Nordisk Fjer which was built in 1901. It now serves as headquarters for Banedanmark. The Twin Warehouses, also known as Warehouse D and E, were built in the 1920s. Other historic buildings are found along Dampf√¶rgevej. New and old: The Fyrt√•rnet residential tower block and an old building at the southern tip of the area The most prominent modern buildings in the area are the Copper Tower on the north side of the area, next to the Ferry Terminal, and Fyrt√•rnet (en. The Lighthouse) on its south side. The Copper Tower is a 16-storey, copper-clad office building which was designed by Arkitema and built in 2004. It houses the law firm Plesner as well as an Italian supermarket in its ground floor. The Lighthouse is a residential tower block designed by Lundgaard & Tranberg and was completed in 2007. Other modern buildings in the area have been designed by C. F. M√∏ller Architects and Hvidt & M√∏lgaard. Transport Amerika Plads is located between √òsterport station and Nordhavn station on the S-train main railway line through Copenhagen.

Webber, and the next five vessels in the class, , , , , and , are all based in Miami, Florida. First of class On September 26, 2008, Bollinger Shipyards in Louisiana, was awarded US$88 million to build the prototype first vessel in its class. The Sentinel-class design is from the Netherlands-based Damen Group, and is based on that company's Damen Stan 4708 patrol vessel. The first vessel Bollinger built became Bernard C. Webber, which is the first of 58 planned Sentinel-class cutters to be put into the U.S. Coast Guard fleet to replace their old 110 ft patrol boats (and their unseaworthy 123 ft cutters), starting with the first six based in Miami, then six in Key West, then six in Puerto Rico. On July 24, 2014, it was announced that the, U.S. Coast Guard had exercised a $225 million option at Bollinger Shipyards in Louisiana for construction through 2017 of an additional six Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutters (FRC), bringing the total number of FRCs under contract with Bollinger to 30. On May 4, 2016, Bollinger Shipyards announced that the U.S. Coast Guard awarded it a new contract for building the final 26 Sentinel-class fast-response cutters. That brings to 58 the total number of FRCs that the USCG ordered from Bollinger. Acquiring the 58 cutters is expected to cost the federal government $3.8 billion ‚Äî an average of about $65 million per cutter. Operational history Bernard C. Webber was launched in April 2011. She commenced her sea trials on November 27, 2011. She arrived in her homeport of Miami, Florida, on February 6, 2012. She was commissioned on April 14, 2012, at the Port of Miami, Miami, Florida. For a week in August 2015 Bernard C. Webber was tasked to host some VIPs, and demonstrate to them the ability of the Coast Guard to protect the United States' borders. In November 2015 the cutter cooperated with the Netherlands offshore patrol vessel in the interception of a large quantity of illicit drugs, off the coast of the Dominican Republic. On April 10, 2016, Bernard C. Webber rescued ten individuals from a vessel that capsized off Freetown, Bahamas. The ten individuals were adrift for about six hours, but none of them were injured. Since they were assessed to be migrants, trying to make their way to United States, they were transferred to the custody of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. Namesake Like the other ships of her class Bernard C. Webber is named after a heroic enlisted member of the Coast Guard. Bernard C. Webber was coxswain of the wooden Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500 that ventured out in seas to rescue men from the stricken T2 tanker that had broken in two during a Winter storm off Chatham, Massachusetts on February 18, 1952. The rescue of the survivors of the shipwrecked Pendleton is considered one of the most daring rescues of the United States Coast Guard. The story of the Pendleton rescue has been made into a motion picture titled The Finest Hours.

It was a shortlisted nominee for the 2011 Scotiabank Giller Prize. The novel is a coming of age story about an 11-year-old boy's journey on a large ship's three-week voyage. Ondaatje himself went on such a voyage in his childhood, from Sri Lanka to England. Synopsis The central character and narrator named Michael, an unaccompanied 11-year-old boy, boards an ocean liner, the Oronsay, in Colombo en route to England via the Suez canal and the Mediterranean. For meals on board Michael is seated at the \\"cat's table\\" (the one furthest from the Captain's table) with other boys Ramadhin and Cassius and other misfit characters. The book follows the adventures of Michael and these boys while they are aboard the Oronsay, and Michael's later perspective as an older man looking back on this boyhood voyage. Characters Seated at The Cat's Table: * Michael (\\"Mynah\\"): the protagonist, 11 years old. * Ramadhin: a quiet boy, 11 years old. * Cassius: a rowdy daredevil boy, 12 years old. * Max Mazappa (stage name Sunny Meadows): pianist with the ship's orchestra in his 30s. * Miss Perinetta Lasqueti: a wan-looking spinster in her 30s with several unforeseen qualities. * Mr. Nevil: a retired ship dismantler. * Larry Daniels: a botanist conveying a \\"garden\\" of live plants to England. * Mr. Gunesekera: a tailor, an apparent mute. Elsewhere on the ship: * Miss Emily de Saram: a distant cousin of Michael and his long-time confidante, 17 years old. * \\"Aunt\\" Flavia Prins: a distant friend of Michael's family who is his ostensible shipboard guardian. She is in First Class and takes the responsibility to oversee Michael very lightly. * Mr. Hastie: Michael's roommate, keeper of the ship's dog kennel and an ardent bridge player. * Mr. Invernio: Mr. Hastie's assistant kennel keeper and fellow bridge player. * Mr. Fonseka: a schoolteacher who introduces Michael to books. * Sir Hector de Silva: a wealthy man suffering from a likely fatal illness, traveling to England for treatment with his family and several doctors. * Sunil (stage name The Hyderabad Mind) a member of the Jankla Troupe of shipboard circus performers. * Asuntha: a frail, nearly deaf young Sinhalese girl. * Niemeyer: a prisoner in chains being conveyed to England for trial. * Mr. Giggs: an English officer escorting Niemeyer to trial. * Mr. Perera: an undercover Ceylonese police officer overseeing Niemeyer. * The Baron C.: a thief who enlists Michael's aid. * The Captain. Not on the ship: * Massoumeh (\\"Massi\\"): Ramadhin's sister, later Michael's wife. Reception Liesl Schillinger for The New York Times, while noting Ondaatje's appended disclaimer that The Cat's Table is a work of fiction, stated, \\"So convincing is Ondaatje‚Äôs evocation of his narrator‚Äôs experience that the reader could easily mistake it for the author‚Äôs own\\". Philip Hensher for The Telegraph was largely positive, writing, \\"Michael Ondaatje‚Äôs impressive new novel, containing dreams and fantasy between a ship‚Äôs flanks. It is, in the most etymological way, a wonderful novel: one full of wonders.\\" Adam Mars-Jones was less impressed, writing in his review in The Observer, \\"Perhaps The Cat's Table aspires to a ‚Ä¶ doubleness of texture and meaning, the yarn of adventure story backed with the deeper colours of adult experience, but on the level of craftsmanship it doesn't measure up.\\" Jess Row, writing for New York Magazine, describeds The Cat's Table as being unlike Ondaatje's earlier works, as it allows the reader to experience what's going on in the characters' heads, not strictly focusing on the setting of the world.

According to tradition in earlier times, the Skidi were associated with the Arikara before the Arikara moved northward. The Skidi language was less related to the other Pawnee languages than the other three tribes' languages were related to each other. In historic times, the Skidi first lived on the Loup River in Nebraska. The Skidi's main habitations were along the Platte River. Some early explorers referred to this waterway as the Panimaha River, since this was before some of the Skidi migrated south; that name came to be associated with a different group. By the 1770s, a group of the Skidi had broken off and moved towards Texas, where they allied with the Taovayas, the Tonkawa, Yojuanes and other Texas tribes. This group was referred to as the Panimaha.

In 1808 he succeeded his maternal uncle Raphael Walsh (Dean of Dromore) to the estate of Ballykilcavan, and adopted the additional surname of Walsh by Royal Licence of 9 May 1809. In 1783, he married Sackvilla (died 1841), first daughter of Edward Brereton, of Springmount in Queen's County, by his wife Frances, daughter of Philip Rawson.

In signing the agreement, web companies are pledging to identify and prevent the transmission of information that Chinese authorities deem objectionable, including information that ‚Äúbreaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity‚Äù, or that ‚Äúmay jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability‚Äù.  Origins and purpose  The pledge was created in 2002 by the Internet Society of China, a self-governing Chinese internet industry body, and within a month of launch had been signed by more than 100 Chinese web companies such as Baidu, Soseen, Sina, and Sohu, as well as by Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Chinese government offices. The pledge contains four chapters and 31 articles covering four ‚Äúprinciples of self-discipline for the Internet industry‚Äù‚Äîpatriotism, observance of the law, fairness, and trustworthiness. Signing it is officially optional, but without having signed it firms are ineligible to receive a Chinese Internet Content Provider license, which is required to obtain a .cn domain.  Current status  As of 2006, the pledge had been signed by more than 3,000 entities operating websites in China.  Criticism  The pledge has been criticized by human rights and freedom of expression organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and the Committee to Protect Journalists. American firms have been criticized as compromising American values related to freedom of speech in order to make money by signing it.  Non-Chinese web companies  Non-Chinese web companies maintain that in order to do business in China they must comply with local laws and regulations, that access to censored information is better than no information at all, and that their presence in China will support economic development leading to political change. But, critics argue their activities are facilitating and sanctioning government censorship rather than challenging it. In 2002 Yahoo signed the pledge. Two years later, it disclosed to the Chinese government that journalist Shi Tao had sent an e-mail to a New York- based site containing notes from a Chinese government directive on how to handle the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Shi Tao was then arrested, convicted, and given a 10-year prison term on a charge of divulging state secrets. This earned Yahoo! significant criticism from Reporters Without Borders and others, including a statement by the chair of the United States House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos that while Yahoo is technologically and financially ‚Äúgiants‚Äù, ‚Äúmorally you are pygmies‚Äù. In 2005 Microsoft signed the pledge. Later in 2005, it deleted from Windows Live Spaces the blog of Chinese journalist and political blogger Jing Zhao, who was known for his writings about freedom of the press in China. The incident made headlines around the world and contributed to ongoing debates about the role of Western companies in China‚Äôs censorship system. In 2006 Google signed the pledge and then launched a censored version of its search engine, called Google.cn, inside China. Before Google.cn, users in China had only been able to reach Google by going through small sometimes-unreliable local service providers. Establishing Google.cn means that for the first time users in China could reach Google directly, making the user experience faster and more reliable. But the move was controversial inside and outside of Google, and on March 23, 2010, Google shut down Google.cn.

She was a long term member of the Australia women's handball team, and participated in six World Championship campaigns for Australia. Cathy, who hails from Queensland, was first named in the Australian national team in 2001. She has represented Australia in a total of 39 matches, which included international tours, tournaments and six World Championships ‚Äì Croatia in 2003, Russia in 2005, France in 2007, China in 2009, Brazil in 2011 and Serbia in 2013. Cathy captained the Australia team at three World Championships and was named player of the match four times. She relishes as one of her greatest moments playing against Macedonia in the preliminary round at the 2007 World Championship and receiving the ‚ÄòBest Player‚Äô award for the first time. This award is usually given to a player from the winning team but was awarded to Cathy to acknowledge the brilliant saves she made. Cathy was first introduced to handball when she was seventeen years old during a school sporting tour, while she was playing touch football at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Handball was something she had never seen before and straight away she fell in love with this relatively unknown sport to Australians. What made it even more appealing to her besides the fact that handball is incredibly fast and takes a lot of talent to play, was that handball is an Olympic sport and that it is a Professional sport for women in many European countries. Before getting involved in handball, Cathy also represented Australia in Ju- Jitsu and was involved in other sports ‚Äì enjoyed a stint in Queensland Rugby, was Captain of u16 Brisbane Basketball, MSN Cricket Captain, Regional Touch Football and Brisbane Futsal. Cathy has two older sisters and one younger brother who have represented Australia in Ju-Jitsu. It was after an Australia Women‚Äôs Handball team tour of Hungary in 2002 that Cathy was given the opportunity to stay on and play with the u21 Junior Cornexi team in Szekesfehervar. After only four months, she returned to Australia to play in the Oceania World Championship Qualifying Tournament which Australia won to compete in the 2003 World Championship held in Croatia. She was then contacted by a Hungarian/Danish lady, Hanna Menzi, and asked if she would like to play in Denmark. Cathy played handball in Denmark in 2003-2004 for GOG Gudme. When she was not training nor playing, she was studying Coaching at the Sports School, Oure, and was Assistant Coach to an U15 junior Danish girls team. After difficulties with getting a Danish visa for her second year, Cathy contacted a past Australian trainer, Niklas Harris who coached and lived in Sweden. He organized a trial for Cathy with a Swedish 1st Division women‚Äôs team called H65, H√∂√∂r. She played in Sweden for three years [2004 ‚Äì 2007], part of that time was with two other Australian players, Raelene Boulton and Katia Boyd. She worked for the club as a cleaner before deciding that she wanted her handball career to take a different direction. Cathy was given the opportunity to trial with a ‚ÄòProfessional Team‚Äô in the French League in La Rochelle. This was where Cathy signed her first fully paid Professional contract. Cathy considers her first year in France [2007-2008] as the best season she had ever had playing in Europe. She was named the Best Keeper with the most number of saves in the Division 2 French League, saving over 304 balls for the season. Then in early 2008, Cathy signed up for a team in Paris called Cergy-Pontoise. Out of a number of clubs which offered her a contract, she accepted Cergy-Pontoise‚Äôs offer as she felt it is a great team with lots of potential and has an experienced Romanian/French Coach to train her and the rest of the team. Cathy also enjoys the excitement and the challenges in playing in the team with four Romanian and three Junior French national team player. Kent was a vital part of French first division team Mios-Biganos- Bassin d'Arcachon claiming of the 2011 European Challenge Cup. While she described the victory as the highlight of her nine-year European career, Kent had quickly switched her focus to Australia's World Championship assault in Brazil. Cathy had dreamt of playing professional handball since she was 17 and was ecstatic that this dream came true. She is also grateful that all her hard work and determination got her to the level she reached. During her playing career she loved the fact that when she woke up in the morning, her job was to train and to play handball. When asked where she sees herself in the next 5 years or so, Cathy said she sees herself still playing handball overseas. She thinks that she may stay overseas and be a goalkeeper trainer for a European team after her handball career. She also has a desire to come back to Australia and help develop handball further as she dreams that one day Australia would have a really strong handball league.

It has been frequently quoted by major news outlets since the beginning of the war about daily numbers of deaths from all sides in the conflict and particularly civilians killed in airstrikes in Syria. The SOHR has been described as being \\"pro-opposition\\" and anti-Assad. Organisation The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is run by \\"Rami Abdulrahman\\" (sometimes referred to as Rami Abdul Rahman), from his home in Coventry. Abdulrahman is a Syrian Sunni who owns a clothing shop. Born Osama Suleiman, he adopted a pseudonym during his years of activism in Syria and has used it publicly ever since. After being imprisoned three times in Syria, Abdulrahman fled to the United Kingdom fearing a fourth jail term and has not returned. In a December 2011 interview with Reuters, Abdulrahman claimed the observatory has a network of more than 200 people and that six of his sources had been killed. In 2012, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung described the organisation as a one-man- operation with Abdulrahman its only permanent member. In April 2013, The New York Times described him as being on the phone all day everyday with contacts in Syria, relying on four individuals inside the country who collate information from more than 230 activists, while cross-checking all information with sources himself. In 2013 the New York Times reported that Rami Abdulrahman had received small subsidies from the European Union and one European country.

Klipper.Benson, copyright page The response is an autonomic reaction elicited by a simple, secular version of Transcendental Meditation (\\"TM\\"), a yogic meditation technique, presented for people in the Western world.Benson, p. 129 Origin Benson writes in his book, \\"We claim no innovation but simply a scientific validation of age-old wisdom\\".Benson, pp. xxxii, 129. People from the Transcendental Meditation movement, who felt they could reduce blood pressure using TM, visited Harvard Medical School in 1968, asking to be studied. The school, which at the time was studying the relationship of monkeys' behavior and blood pressure, told them \\"No, thank you.\\" But when they persisted, Benson told them he would study them. He met with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi first to find out if he could agree in advance to any outcome, which Mahesh did. Benson mentions in his book that independent studies were already underway by then-PhD candidate R. Keith Wallace working with Archie Wilson at the University of California, Los Angeles, but that no published studies of TM existed.Benson, pp. 61‚Äì63. Benson's study found that when the subjects meditated, their metabolic rate markedly decreased in a matter of minutes.Benson, pp. 65‚Äì68. Further studies on subjects with high blood pressure showed that meditation over several weeks lowered blood pressure by a statistically significant amount.Benson, pp. 111-118. Eliciting the response Benson's website and his book describe four essential components of meditation needed to bring about the response: a mental device (a simple word, phrase or activity to repeat to keep the mind from wandering), a passive attitude, a quiet environment, and a comfortable position. From these components, Benson developed a 6-step technique for eliciting the response for study at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. By 1996, only two of the four components were found to be essential: a mental device and a passive attitude. An updated edition of his book divided the 6 steps further into 9 steps, as is taught at the Benson-Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital. The goal is to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which causes humans to relax. Fight-or-flight Benson developed the idea of the response, which counters the fight-or-flight response described during the 1920s by Walter Bradford Cannon at the Harvard Medical School. According to Benson more than 60 percent of all visits to healthcare providers are related to stress. It causes the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine, to secrete into the bloodstream. This incites or exacerbates a number of conditions. They include hypertension, headaches, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic low back pain, as well as heart disease, stroke and cancer.Taking Charge, Massachusetts General Hospital Magazine, 2012 A physician with ABC News adds that the immune system works best when relaxed. He said about twenty deep breaths per day, done \\"with intention\\", can accomplish this. Reception In a 1986 US national survey, reported in The New York Times, this best-seller was the number one self-help book that clinical psychologists recommended to their patients.

He was a founder of Myoma Band, the longest surviving music band in the modern Burmese history. Between 1935 and 1939, he recorded over 40 albums and composed a couple of Myanmar New Year (Thingyan) songs that became iconic, performed on Myoma's Silver Swan parade floats, which became a trademark of Thingyan celebration in Mandalay. Early life and education Nyein was born on 25 January 1909 in Mandalay, British Burma, son of U Nyi, a goldsmith, and mother Daw Chit Oo, a lacquerware merchant. He was educated at Central National School, Mandalay. At the age of ten, he learnt a Burmese classic titled Jambu Kyun Lone (Universal) from Deva Einda Maung Maung Gyi in a single day much to the surprise of the famous harpist. In 1925 he co-founded the Myoma (meaning City Proper) music band or Myoma Amateur Music Association with his teacher artist and musician U Ba Thet and a city burgher Dahdan U Thant. Repertoire Myoma Nyein's greatest love song was Chit Da Phadana (Love is Fundamental), the gramophone recording made circa 1935-38. Myoma Troupe in 1958 One of his earlier songs written in 1939 was Eindawya Paya Zay in support of Mandalay's central Zegyo Market shopkeepers' all out strike against Section 23(7) enacted by the British colonial government when they relocated to the Eindawya Pagoda precincts. During the Second World War, the music troupe along with the townspeople of Mandalay fled to Sagaing Hills across the Ayeyarwady River, and Myoma Nyein came up with the song Sagaing Taung (Sagaing Hills) among others. After the war in 1945, when Mandalay held a major sporting event, Myoma Nyein wrote for the occasion songs titled Olympics and Yin Dago Me (Beauty Contest). His song for the 1947 Burmese New Year Thingyan Shwe Man Taung Yeikkho aka Mya Nandar (In the Shade of Mandalay Hill) has become a perennial classic during the festive season. In 1952 he wrote Lu Chun Lu Gaung (Good and Able) in honour of Prime Minister U Nu's Pyidawtha (Welfare state) Conference in Rangoon. The following year he composed Gaba Nyeinchan Yay (World Peace). He started collaborating with Mandalay Motion Picture Company the next year. Family In 1928 Myoma Nyein married Than May, a school teacher from Meiktila. His oldest daughter Tin Kyi was married to the artist Paw Oo Thet. His oldest son Shoon Myaing has carried on with the band which celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2005. Death It was believed that Myoma Nyein committed suicide in 1955, aged 46, by walking in front of a lorry. He remains an inspiration for the generations that followed in the Burmese music scene.

She reformed the Swedish library policy and introduced the free public libraries in Sweden. Biography Valfrid Palmgren was the daughter of Karl Edvard A H Palmgren (1840-1910) and his wife Ida Teresia Pohl (1853-1937). She was educated at Palmgrenska samskolan, her father's school which was the first co-educational school in Europe, and was herself active there as a teacher from 1896‚Äì1907. She graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Uppsala in 1905 and was employed as a Teaching assistant at the Kungliga biblioteket. She worked for reforms in the policy of the Swedish libraries, demanding that public libraries be open to all; that the loans be free of charge; that there be a public library accessible in each city; and that the libraries be free from political, commercial and religious censorship. During the Conservative government of Prime Minister Arvid Lindman, she was asked to write a government report proposing a new policy on libraries based on her international expertise and on the idea of popular enlightenment. She managed to have all her demands met and introduced to government policy, and is mainly remembered for this. In 1910, Palmgren was elected to the Stockholm City Council as a representative of the Conservative Party. She married Danish hydro-engineer Jon Julius Munch-Petersen (1873-1939) in 1911 and moved to Denmark. The couple had four sons including writer and painter Gustaf Munch-Petersen (1912‚Äì1938). She became a member of the board of the public libraries in Copenhagen in 1918. She served as a member of the board for the Copenhagen municipal library and was a lecturer at Copenhagen University. Honors In 1932, she was awarded the Swedish Royal Medal Illis Quorum. In 1955, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala.

It was designed by architect Albert Held. The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History In 1903, the lot Amman stands on was sold to the Amman Family by the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank. Construction began by March 1904, when Apartment units in the building were advertised in the local paper, The Spokesman-Review. The building was used as housing until 1985, when it underwent a National Park Service certified rehabilitation turning the apartments into office space. The renovation was done by Wells & Company, a company specializing in certified renovations of old and historic buildings. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of a thematic group containing San Marco, Breslin and Knickerbocker Apartment Buildings. Description The two-story building sits on a tree lined street in Browne's Addition, the neighborhood has a uniquely residential feel considering its proximity to the city center. The lot to the west of the building is used for parking. Due to its location, the building offers views of the Spokane River. Of the buildings in the thematic group, the Amman Apartments had the simplest design, with a square footprint rather than the U, H and L shapes of the other apartment buildings built by Held. The building design can most easily be described as classical. The apartment units had clear delineation of living and entertainment spaces by use of narrow hallways in order to separate the design from common \\"railroad\\" plans. Another unique feature is that all rooms had an exterior view, instead of the common light court of the era. The common hallway features a large curved stairway and access to the balcony above the portico on the second story.

In March 1980, Aero Le√≥n received two Douglas DC-8-24 planes and started flights to Central and South America.Flight Global 1993, p.167 In April 1983, Aero Le√≥n had an incident while it was carrying cattle to Brazil. The aircraft (a DC-8) suffered a depressurization problem and had an emergency landing. After landing, the cattle were found dead, due to the temperature descending to subfreezing levels by the depressurization; after an investigation, DGAC found several maintenance failures in the fleet of Aero Le√≥n. The airline was suspended on May 21. However, the airline renewed its papers, gave a massive maintenance to the fleet and returned to fly on June 10, when their AOC was returned. On July 28, the airline suffered another incident after one airplane had an emergency landing at Mexico City. An investigation found more than 36 human corpses in the airplane. The airline was called to meeting with the civil authorities, and although the airline said that a group of people were responsible for a sabotage the previous night and had introduced the corpses into the aircraft, the crew was accused of traffic of corpses. After the session, the directors of the airline were condemned to 26 years of prison and the pilots, people in charge of operations and in-flight personnel were sentenced to 17 years of prison. Finally, the AOC of Aero Le√≥n was removed on September 16 and the airline was closed 2 days later. A particular case was the president of the airline (Eucario Le√≥n), who although was condemned to permanent imprisonment, was released in 1998 due to his advanced age. Later, Le√≥n died in October 2002 in a Mexico City hospital, after spending 13 months there due to a coronary problem.

The vessel served 1959-1976 on a regular route between the UK and South Africa for the Southampton to Las Palmas, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban \\"Cape Mail\\" service. After the vessel's disposal by Union-Castle, she was re-named consecutively Ocean Queen, Sinbad, then Sinbad I, however the ship did not return to commercial service. Design and construction In 1953 Sir George Christopher assumed leadership of Union-Castle. Early in 1955 the company ordered Pendennis Castle from Harland and Wolff to replace the ageing which then had over 30 years of service. The new ship's keel was laid on 8 November 1955. On 31 January 1956 the Union-Castle Mail Steam Ship Co.Ltd merged with Clan Line Steamers Ltd. to form British & Commonwealth Shipping Company. The merger resulted in Clan Line people taking the leading role in the new company's management and they immediately decided to improve and enlarge Pendennis Castle even though she was already under construction. The ship had originally been intended as a third example of the Pretoria Castle class, but the fitting of Denny-Brown stabilizers required lengthening amidships and her overall length was increased by 18ft. Pendennis Castle was to be launched on 10 December 1957 but a shipyard strike caused the launching to be cancelled and she was instead simply christened by the Dowager Lady Rotherwick. On 24 December 1957 she was launched without ceremony. After successful sea trials Pendennis Castle was delivered to Union-Castle by Harland and Wolff on 14 November 1958. Union- Castle service RMS Pendennis Castle embarked on her maiden voyage on 1 January 1959. Commanded by Commodore George Mayhew of the Union-Castle fleet, she set out from Southampton bound for Durban. The shipping press voted Pendennis Castle as the \\"ship of the year\\" In 1964 the vessel's air conditioning was extended into all first class cabins. Private showers were fitted into 21 additional cabins. In July 1965 Union-Castle introduced a faster mail service by reducing the voyage time from 13 to 11 days, allowing service to be operated by seven liners instead of eight. Following the success of the introduction of \\"stewardettes\\" in the one class Transvaal Castle, these female waiting staff were added to the other ships in the fleet. Attempts at improving the voyage experience for younger passengers led to the introduction of improved recreational programmes, leading some to use the term \\"fun ship\\". This, however, did not catch on and is today associated with the vessels of Carnival Cruises. In May 1968 an onboard fire broke out while Pendennis Castle was berthed in Southampton, resulting in limited damage to some forward accommodation. However the vessel managed to sail with Harland & Wolff workers on board performing the repairs. As a result of the fire, one of two first class passenger lifts remained out of service for the remainder of the ship's career. One year later, when diverted to Antwerp due to labor dispute in Southampton, the vessel struck the quayside and had to be taken out of service for a month. Later that year Pendennis Castle set a new Union-Castle record for the fastest passage time from Cape Town to Southampton. Rising oil prices in 1973 forced Union-Castle to add one day to the service and increase fares. By 1976 however the move to containerization of cargo and the rise in air travel made the Union-Castle mail ships unprofitable. On 23 April 1976 Pendennis Castle sailed from Southampton for the final time, bound for South Africa. On her final voyage from South Africa to Southampton, the vessel wore a Paying-off pennant. On 14 June 1976, after arriving in Southampton for the final time, she was withdrawn from service. Post Union-Castle service Pendennis Castle was sold to the Panama registered Ocean Queen Navigation Company and was renamed Ocean Queen. Now displaying a white hull and golden brown funnel, she sailed for what was intended to be a new service life as a cruise ship, in Hong Kong. However, the vessel would not return to commercial service. In 1978 the ship was sold to Kinvara Bay Shipping of Panama and renamed Sinbad, later amended to Sinbad I, but remained idle.Kludas, Great Passenger Ships of the World Vol.6 Finally in April 1980 the ex-Pendennis Castle departed Hong Kong for the final time, bound for scrapping in Kaoshiung, Taiwan.

Homeland Mulbarapa country extends along the Lake Alexandrina shoreline from Poikangk to Pemandang Bluff. The Berndts describe it as follows: > From the Bluff, the boundary skirted a native track to Lalanganggel (Mt > Misery)... The boundary extends south-east to north of Albert Hill, then > north-east of Kutingwar and northwards to a point north by north-east of > Minmulewar. South-east of Minmulewar, passing Trewunang Swamp This stretched > from Trewunang to Punguldulin, with scrubland on its western border. The site at Pemandang was where legend held it that the dreamtime culture hero Ngurunderi, having minced Pondi(Ponde - Murray cod), stepped ashore from his bark canoe. Until relatively modern times, before they were broken, the shape of footprints on stones here were pointed out as those of Ngurunderi. Likewise, two sandhills at Lalangange marked his former campsite there. Punguldulin was the place of the kangaroo rat. Flora and fauna Mulbarapa country was well supplied with game, with great numbers of tulatji (wallaby), wangyumi (kangaroo), pindjuli (emu), wiruringguri (mallee hen) and talkundjeri (wild turkey) available to hunters venturing throuhh the mallee scrub back of Pemandang. The Mulbarapa (ngatji, or totems) were the no≈ãkulauri, the (mountain duck) and the trewari (a black-backed and white-winged shag, which was distinguished from the larger cormorant, yoldi). As their totemic animal these could not be directly hunted, but the Mulbarapa are said to have had people from other clans hunt them, and thus obtained, they could be eaten, a practice some Ramindjeri clans would not indulge in. kandjuri and wiloki yams and the kukindji and moronggoni potatoes were dug, while karangki (currants) and ngalaii (yacca grass honey) were gathered. Poikangk Bay afforded the Mulbarapa excellent fishing. Traditions and ceremonies Mulbarapa are allied to Pinpulalindjara in that these clans call each other brother and sister, irrespective of genealogical ties. Similarity of dialect who had the right to hunt over each other's territories and the obligation to stand together against aggressors in interclan fighting. Berndt wrote that the Pinpulalindjara quite likely hived off from Mulbarapa. In the Mulbarapi clan wild dog ceremony, men danced with plain stripes painted down their legs, but they also had pipeclay stripes on their faces and dots on their chests. This was not regarded as specifically religious, although directly associated with ngatji. Possibly they were originally pre-initiatory songs and dances.

The station's broadcast license is held C. Steve Hegwood, through licensee Core Communicators North LLC. Coverage area WIPK transmits from east-southeast of the city, on the ridge east of Interstate 75. Completing its application, construction permit, and application for broadcast license all within 2011, the station serves several counties in northwest Georgia, including all of Gordon county and parts of surrounding ones. The usable signal usually reaches as far south and southeast as the north and northwestern exurbs of metro Atlanta. Reception in the Etowah/Allatoona basin is typically good in places near Cartersville and Woodstock, but south of the ridge that includes Kennesaw Mountain and Sweat Mountain, signal strength drops off going down toward the Chattahoochee River valley, where it is now overwhelmed by W233BF. History In June 2011, Radio WEBS, Inc., applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on October 31, 2011, with a scheduled expiration date of October 31, 2014. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WIPK\\" on November 8, 2011. After construction and testing were completed in November 2011, the station began broadcasting under program test authority while awaiting its broadcast license. Having gone on the air in November 2011, right around Thanksgiving, it originally broadcast a radio format of all Christmas music, ranging from country to pop, to long-time classics, and even comedy (\\"Leroy the Redneck Reindeer\\", \\"Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy\\", \\"Christmas Don't Be Late\\", \\"The Twelve Pains of Christmas\\"). This DJ-less broadcast automation continued until around 1:00 AM on January 4, when it switched to an equally wide variety of non-Christmas music, ranging from modern country to Lady Gaga. Previously a recorded announcer, the voiceovers for the interim format were done by speech synthesis, and stated that \\"a new station is coming soon to this channel\\", and mentioned cities within the station's broadcast range. The original launch of its regular format, scheduled for 9:45 a.m. on January 3, 2012, did not occur due to technical issues. On January 17, the station switched to a recording of a heartbeat, with announcements every two minutes that the new format would finally begin the next morning. On January 18, the station manager introduced the WEBS/WIPK staff that had made the new station possible, using the moniker \\"Kickin' 94.5\\", and at 9:56 a.m. began playing \\"Gone Country\\". The all-country format mixes current music along with songs from recent decades, back to the 1980s. The FCC granted WIPK its broadcast license on January 27, 2012, after it had already been operating under automatic program test authority for the two months prior. In August 2014, WIPK had been under contract to be sold to the owner of co-channel W233BF \\"Streetz 94.5\\" in Atlanta, which would presumably then simulcast on WIPK, similar to the situation with WTSH-FM and W296BB on 107.1, which also serve northwest Georgia and metro Atlanta respectively. Previously, WIPK had submitted complaints of RF interference caused by W233BF, as had WFDR-FM 94.5 on the other side of Atlanta. The sale closed on January 13, 2015, along with the format change. On January 13, 2015, WIPK changed their format to a simulcast of urban-formatted WSTR-HD3, branded as \\"Streetz 94.5\\".Streetz Expands in North Georgia On October 6, 2015, WIPK broke away from the Streetz simulcast and flipped to Top 40/CHR as \\"i94.5\\".https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/94817/wipk-brings-chr-to- northwest-georgia/ As of February 1, 2019, WIPK went back on the air as Streetz 94.5 hip hop format.

Bogucki and his wife Janina n√©e Godlewska (8 March 1908 ‚Äì 19 June 1992) are known for helping and hiding the Polish Jewish pianist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Szpilman's life inspired the 2002 film The Pianist, and both Bogucki and his wife were portrayed in the film. Although he lived in Warsaw for most of his life, Bogucki also worked in several other cities. He lived in Warsaw's Mariensztat neighborhood from 1947 until the end of his life, and he is buried in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery in the western part of Warsaw. Bogucki was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta for his career and actions during World War II. In 1978 the Yad Vashem institute awarded him and his wife the Righteous Among the Nations award, an award given to non-Jewish people who helped Jews during the Nazi persecution.Andrzej Bogucki ‚Äì his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website Early life Bogucki was born to a family with long-standing traditions in theatre and stage. His parents were the actors Stanis≈Çaw Bogucki and R√≥≈ºa Bogucka-Rapacka. He was the grandson of the famous Polish actor and director Wincenty Rapacki. Bogucki attended and graduated as a cavalry officer from the Officer's Cadet School in GrudziƒÖdz. While at school he participated in equestrian competitions and became an officer in the Polish Army. He served in the 7th Regiment Cavalry in Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki, but was discharged for health reasons in 1929. In the same year he began appearing in stage plays for children. From then on, he focused on his acting career. World War II During World War II, Bogucki and his wife were involved with the anti-Nazi Polish resistance movement, the Armia Krajowa (Home Army). In February 1944 they were contacted through members of the Jewish underground by their friend, the pianist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, who was working as a slave laborer as one of the remaining Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto. Anticipating that the Germans were planning to liquidate even the slave workers (most other Jews had already been deported to Treblinka), Szpilman, with help from Bogucki, escaped the ghetto and hid on the non-Jewish side of Warsaw. With help from Bogucki, Janina and others, Szpilman survived the war. His life was later the basis for the 2002 film The Pianist. After the war, in the 1950s Szpilman composed songs especially for Andrzej and Janina, including the popular Czerwony autobus (Red bus). Work Theatre Bogucki began working onstage on 30 April 1930. He performed at the Polish Theatre in Warsaw for three years between 1930 and 1933 and later worked at the New Comedy Theater between 1933 and 1934. He also worked for theaters in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Krak√≥w. After the end of World War II, he returned to the stage at the Polish Army Theatre in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he performed between 1945 and 1947. He went on to work in several other theaters, including the National Theater, Warsaw, where he played from 1969 until his death in 1978. Career as a singer Bogucki began his singing career in 1931 at the Banda Theater, where he remained for a year until 1932. It was his distinctive singing voice that brought him most of his popularity. After 1945, he continued to write songs and launched a number of hits in the radio. He was a longtime employee of the Polish Radio. In addition, he worked with Radio Theatre of the Imagination (as a presenter, singer and reciter, and as a popularizer of music and literature).

Published in 2012, it is the first book of a prequel trilogy to Ender's Game.-Official Fan site The novel is set before Ender Wiggin is born and tells the story of the first Formic War. Earth Afire, the second book in the trilogy, was released on June 4, 2013, and the conclusion, Earth Awakens, was released June 10, 2014. Plot A family of \\"free miners\\" living on the spaceship El Cavador is working an asteroid far out in the Kuiper Belt when they detect what appears to be an alien ship decelerating from near light speed as it approaches the solar system. Meanwhile, Lem Jukes, son and heir of the hard-driving founder of the largest mining corporation, is also in the remote region, far from the prying eyes of competitors, secretly testing a \\"glaser\\" (gravity laser) that promises to revolutionize mining. Back on Earth, Captain Wit O'Toole goes recruiting among the elite New Zealand Special Air Service for the even more select, multinational Mobile Operations Police (MOPs). Jukes orders his ship to \\"bump\\" El Cavador from the asteroid the family is mining, as it is the only suitable one nearby for his test. During the violent collision, an El Cavador crewman is killed. The miners hack into the corporate ship's network, planting a message for Lem Jukes and downloading confidential files pertaining to the glaser. Jukes, fearful of a scandal involving the death of a free miner and the danger of the miners selling the confidential files to his competitors, sets out for Weigh Station Four, where he intends to plant a hacker to strip El Cavadors files. El Cavadors transmission equipment having been destroyed in the bump, the crew are unable to warn another mining clan about the intruder, and can only watch helplessly as the alien pod destroys them. El Cavador rescues a few survivors. In the meantime, Victor and a few others modify a \\"quickship,\\" an automated vessel normally used to send processed metals to Luna, to carry one person to warn Earth. When the pod attacks El Cavador, the men on the quickship ram and disable the pod using mining equipment. During the attack, the aliens emerge to battle the humans. Their physiology is revealed to be Formic (ant-like). El Cavador heads to Weigh Station Four to use their laserline transmitter. As a backup, Victor volunteers to take a datacube with the evidence of the aliens' hostile intentions to Luna aboard the quickship. The journey is perilous, but their duty is clear. Meanwhile, the Juke ship makes its way to Weigh Station Four, only to come under attack from roughnecks who recognize the crew as despised corporates. Several of the attackers are killed by Chubs, a man seemingly junior to Lem Jukes, but revealed as having been assigned by Ukko Jukes to protect him. The corporates are still able to leave behind a hacker to strip El Cavadors files, but the scheme becomes moot when the Formic ship destroys the station. El Cavador sends a short-range, broad radio call and is able to contact the Juke ship and a Chinese mining vessel. El Cavador sends its women and children aboard the Chinese vessel, which is too small to help in the attack. The plan is to plant mining explosives along the hull of the alien ship. Unfortunately, one of them detonates early, drawing the attention of the Formics, who at first engage the humans wearing space suits, but subsequently attack without any protection. Seeing the battle go against them, Chubs withdraws Lem Jukes and his men and moves the corporate ship away, as the Formic ship destroys El Cavador. Victor arrives at Luna, only to be largely ignored and confined for his illegal arrival. Meanwhile, Wit O'Toole prepares his MOPs for any situation, including what he thinks is a hypothetical alien attack. Victor is eventually assigned a case worker who believes his story and helps him transmit the evidence onto the Nets.

The awards‚Äîfor performance and achievement‚Äîare named for legendary players of Negro Leagues Baseball. The awards were first presented for the 2000 Major League Baseball season. The first Legacy Awards‚Äîin 2000‚Äîwere presented in November at the \\"Legacy 2000 Players‚Äô Reunion and Awards Banquet\\", which was organized to honor the tenth anniversary of the opening of the museum and the eightieth anniversary of the establishment of the Negro National League. For the next nine years (2001‚Äì2009), each year's awards were presented at a banquet in January or February of the following year. In 2010, there was no banquet. Instead, the awards were presented at separate events at the museum and in various major-league ballparks through the spring of 2011. The twelfth annual awards (for 2011) were presented at an awards banquet on January 28, 2012. In January, 2013 Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick announced that the 2013 awards banquet would be the final one held. All further awards will be presented to the 2010 awards, at various MLB ballparks or if the award winner happens to be in Kansas City with his team to play against the Royals. The logistics of off-season travel were the primary reason cited by Kendrick for the permanent change. Indeed, of all those honored for their 2012 season only the Padres Everth Cabrera, traveling from his off-season home in Nicaragua, was able to make it to Kansas City for the January 12th banquet and presentation. Previously, the proceeds from the Legacy Awards annual banquet were used for the benefit of the museum.

Overview Lisa Tuttle has defined feminist theory as asking \\"new questions of old texts\\".Tuttle, Lisa. Encyclopedia of Feminism. Harlow: Longman 1986, p. 184. She cites the goals of feminist criticism as (1) developing and uncovering a female tradition of writing, (2) interpreting symbolism of women's writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view, (3) rediscovering old texts, (4) analyzing women writers and their writings from a female perspective, (5) resisting sexism in literature, and (6) increasing awareness of the sexual politics of language and style. Feminist revisionist mythology tends to fulfill at least one of these goals. Instead of just studying prior works though, it is the revision of old texts to create new ones. Revision Mythmaking is a strategic revisionist use of gender imagery and is a means of exploring and attempting to transform the self and the culture or, in other words, to \\"subvert and transform the life and literature women poets inherit\\".Ostriker, Alicia. Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 211. Alicia Ostriker states in her essay \\"Stealing the Language\\" that \\"we cannot measure the work of women poets, past or present, without a thorough--and if possible demystified-- awareness of the critical context in which they have composed and continued to compose their work. We need to recognize that our customary literary language is systematically gendered in ways that influence what we approve and disapprove of, making it extremely difficult for us to acknowledge certain kinds of originality--of difference--in women poets\\".Ostriker, Alicia, Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 2‚Äì3. \\"The belief that true poetry is genderless‚Äîwhich is a disguised form of believing that true poetry is masculine‚Äîmeans that we have not learned to see women poets generically, to recognize the tradition they belong to, or discuss either the limitation or the strengths of that tradition\\".Ostriker, Alicia, Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 9.  Methods  Authors have used multiple methods of revising myths, including retelling them entirely from the point of view of the main female character, recreating the story in a way that attempts to break down the treatment of women as inactive objects, and telling the story with a feminist narrator who satirically pokes fun at the flawed view of women in the original text. \\"Fables are centuries old and were devised to carry a moral lesson, such as Aesop's Fables. Suniti Namjoshi's eloquent and knowledgeable 'Blue Donkey' stories draw on this classic tradition of having beasts or mythical birds able to speak and act like humans but the 'Blue Donkey' provides ironic comment rather than a moral lesson. Angela Carter has rewritten fairy tales from the point of view of the heroine. In her collection, The Bloody Chamber, she examines the messages about adolescent sexuality in stories like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Snow White' overturning the sexual mythology of simple fairy stories.\\"McNeill, Pearlie. Fairy Tales. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge. 3. New York: Rutledge, 2000. Print. Since the core of revisionist mythmaking for feminist poets lies in the challenging of gender stereotypes embodied in myth, revisionism in its most obvious form consists of hit-and-run attacks on familiar images and the social and literary conventions supporting them. The poems dismantle the literary convention to reveal the social ones and invert both, usually by the simple device of making \\"the Other\\" into the primary subject.Ostriker, Alicia, Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America.

It is found at Cedar Point, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Valleyfair. Riders will get soaked on the ride at all the parks. All of the rides include water falls and water shoots. Information Cedar Point Thunder Canyon is one of two water rides at Cedar Point, the other being Snake River Falls. Thunder Canyon uses water pumped in from Sandusky Bay every morning instead of a closed water system on many other water rides. The ride closes every year in late August to be transformed into Cornstalkers, an attraction for HalloWeekends. Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom Thunder Canyon is located towards the back of the park. It can be found along the back path leading to Wildwater Kingdom while the ride itself is placed on four acres of land within the track of the Cedar Creek Cannonball. The attraction is 1,640 feet long, uses 200 horsepower pumps to generate the river using one million gallons of water at a rate of 112,000 gallons per minute, and was designed by Barr Engineering for the cost of $3.8 Million. This ride is unique compared to other rides of the same type for a few reasons. The ride is known for being one of the wettest version of its type. It is also known for its special use of its water reservoir, which instead of being hidden back stage, is used as a dramatic million gallon backdrop for the ride. Thunder Canyon is one of three water rides at Dorney Park, the other two being White Water Landing and Thunder Creek Mountain.

This husband and wife duohttp://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/USHS_Class&CISOPTR;=1422 dedicated much of their time for collecting and preserving the cultural expressions of the American West and Mormon folklore. The Fifes‚Äô work has influenced not only the generations of folklorists who have tried to follow in their footsteps but also the lives of countless Utahans, who have enjoyed a richer cultural experience because of the many folk festivals and folklore programs inspired by the Fifes‚Äô dedication and service.

Golden Kimball Narratives.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 153‚Äì55. Austin and Alta Fife were dedicated to the future of folkloristics in Utah (153). Barbara Lloyd explains that ‚ÄúAustin and Alta Fife . . . met at Utah State University. . . . [and] as a married couple, they began folklore research together in the late 1930s when they were living in California, where Austin was a graduate student at Stanford University, serving as research assistant to the distinguished professor of Hispanic- American folklore, Aurelio Espinosa, Sr.‚Äù (2004, 230).Lloyd, Barbara. 2004. ‚ÄúLessons of Summer: The Fife Folklore Conference.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 230‚Äì39. Notably, the Fifes worked together as a team, an aspect of their folkloristic efforts that David Stanleyhttp://digitalcommons.usu.edu/do/search/advanced?q=author%3A%22Stanley%22%20AND%20author%3A%22David%22 identifies as one of the two items he finds ‚Äúespecially pertinent and interesting to the study and collection of Utah folklore‚Äù (2004, 1).Stanley, David. 2004. Preface. Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Logan, Utah State University Press. The other interesting item that Stanley mentions is an interview transcript of Alta, who describes her trip with Austin across the country following the ‚ÄúMormon Trail‚Äù from Palmyra, New York, to Salt Lake City, Utah. Stanley explains that ‚Äúthe Fifes‚Äô purpose on this journey was to collect not Mormon folklore but folklore about Mormons from those residents of the Midwest who still recounted tales about ‚Äòwhen the Mormons were here‚Äô‚Äù (1).Stanley, David. 2004. Preface. Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Logan, Utah State University Press. In his essay focused on the Fifes, William A. Wilson describes their profound influence on folklore in Utah: :Austin and Alta Fife devoted much of their lives to interpreting the Mormon and Western culture that had produced them. Just as their parents and grandparents had helped pioneer the West, they broke new ground in American folklore scholarship‚Äîin the study of Mormon folklore, cowboyhttp://library.usu.edu/folklo/folkarchive/cowboypoetry2.php and western folksong, and material folk culture‚Äîand charted a course others were to follow (2004, 41).Wilson, William A. 2004. ‚ÄúAustin and Alta Fife, Pioneer Folklorists.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 41‚Äì48. The Fifes and Folkloristics at USU In 1960, the Fifes returned to Utah so that Austin could teach classes at Utah State University (USU) in French and folklore (Lloyd 230).Lloyd, Barbara. 2004. ‚ÄúLessons of Summer: The Fife Folklore Conference.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 230‚Äì39. When Austin planned to retire in the 1970s, he selected William A. Wilson to run the folklore program at USU because Wilson seemed like ‚Äúsomeone who could provide strong leadership for the new [folklore] archive and who had the right kind of vision for the future, for what the USU folklore program could become‚Äù (Lloyd 231).Lloyd, Barbara. 2004. ‚ÄúLessons of Summer: The Fife Folklore Conference.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 230‚Äì39. As a result of the Fifes folklore research and advocacy, USU now has a folklore program, the Fife Folklore Workshop, the Fife Folklore Archives, the Fife Folklore Conference, and a legacy of folkloristic scholarship worth being proud of. The Fife Folklore Archives According to USU's \\"History\\"webpage, the Fifes donated their collection of folklore research to Utah State University‚Äôs Merrill-Cazier Library in 1966, a collection which was eventually called the Fife Folklore Archives: ‚Äúone of a number of leading research facilities that acquire, preserve and make available the materials in folklore fields.‚Äù‚ÄúHistory: Fife Folklore Archives .‚Äù Utah State University. Web. Accessed 14 November 2011. The Fife Folklore Conferences The Fife Folklore Conference is a five-day workshop that gives USU students a chance to meet folklore scholars from other colleges throughout the United States.Williams, Randy. 2005. ‚ÄúFolk Collection 31.‚Äù The Fife Folklore Conference Collection. Utah State University. In an essay dedicated to this topic, Barbara Lloyd, director of one of the many Fife Folklore Conferences, describes it this way: :The conference was a perfect time for us to gather together people we loved, to talk about ideas we loved, and nothing else really mattered. It was and is a brief and shining moment for folklore. (238)Lloyd, Barbara. 2004. ‚ÄúLessons of Summer: The Fife Folklore Conference.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 230‚Äì39. Lloyd also asserts that ‚Äúsome of the greatest lessons in folklore were available to be learned at the Fife Conference‚Äù each year, where she learned from folklorist William A. Wilson ‚Äúthat the separations between fine art and folk art, between high-brow literature and folk narrative, are so minimal that it would be much more accurate to speak of all literature and not make the separations that we do,‚Äù but from Austin Fife she learned ‚Äúabout the stuff itself‚Äîour folklore‚Äîand how it matters, even how texts can matter apart from context or performance . . . and how any context is magnified and often enriched and nourished by the traditional elements it may contain‚Äù (Lloyd 2004, 236‚Äì37).Lloyd, Barbara. 2004. ‚ÄúLessons of Summer: The Fife Folklore Conference.‚Äù Folklore in Utah: A History and Guide to Resources. Edited by David Stanley. Logan, Utah State University Press. 230‚Äì39. Wilson and the Fife Honor Lecture In his essay, ‚ÄúBuilding Bridges: Folklore in the Academy,‚Äù William A.

Bringing in Ed Przychodzki on drums and Vic Denson on bass guitar the lineup was finished six months later. Following the creation of a demo and extensive touring the band they were approached by a New York label to record their debut album. Following recording in both New York and Minneapolis their debut \\"Consider it Contempt\\" was completed. Shortly before the release of the album Przychodzki left the band citing creative differences. The band then sought out a replacement for the subsequent tour of the album, drafting in Billy Johnson. Reception to both the tour and the album were good but as the band were preparing to enter the studio to record their second album the demands of the label for a \\"pop record\\" forced the band to end their contract and seek out a different label. Distractions got in the way of the search for a new label and the band split ways in 1998 with Denson joining the band Cotton, Johnson playing with Frogpond, Onward Crispin Glover and Shots Fired and McNearney moving to Austin and starting Vegas Amateur and Corruption Is King. However due to demand from the fans the band reunited in 2004 to record their follow-up album Stroke of Genius on Crustacean Records with the album finally released in 2006.

She fabricated 18 replicas of the hotel's menu stands, and used them to display the photographs. David Levi-Strauss wrote that Bien's art piece is a \\"polysemous work of absence, in which what happens between images is the most important.\\" The work was displayed at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1987 and at the Amsterdams Historisch Museum in 1988. Some of Bien's work is concerned with Franz Kafka; one of her photographs has her place her hand on a portrait of Kafka's, in response to a note he wrote in 1924 to Dora Diamant, \\"Place your hand on my forehead for a moment, so I can gain courage.\\" Her 1989 installation Past Perfect asked \\"what would have happened had [Kafka] not died in 1924, but instead had come as a refugee to America in the late '30s.\\" It gained her international recognition, and was also shown in Jerusalem.

The most widely acknowledged type of shifting is heavy NP shift,See Ross (1967). but shifting involving a heavy NP is just one manifestation of the shifting mechanism. Shifting occurs in most if not all European languages, and it may in fact be possible in all natural languages. Shifting is not inversion, and inversion is not shifting, but the two mechanisms are similar insofar as they are both present in languages like English that have relatively strict word order. The theoretical analysis of shifting varies in part depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes relatively flat structures, shifting does not result in a discontinuity.See Osborne (2019:213-216) for an analysis of shifting in terms of flat structures. Shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The weight of a constituent is determined by a number of factors: e.g., number of words, contrastive focus, and semantic content. Basic examples Shifting is illustrated with the following pairs of sentences. The first sentence of each pair shows what can be considered canonical order, whereas the second gives an alternative order that results from shifting: ::I gave the books which my uncle left to me as part of his inheritance to her. :: I gave to her the books which my uncle left to me as part of his inheritance. The first sentence with canonical order, where the object noun phrase (NP) precedes the oblique prepositional phrase (PP), is marginal due to the relative 'heaviness' of the NP compared to the PP. The second sentence, which shows shifting, is better because it has the lighter PP preceding the much heavier NP. The following examples illustrate shifting with particle verbs: ::He picked it up. (compare: *He picked up it.) ::He picked up the flashlight. ::John took him on. (compare: *John took on him.) ::John took on the new player. When the object of the particle verb is a pronoun, the pronoun must precede the particle, whereas when the object is an NP, the particle can precede the NP. Each of the two constituents involved is said to shift, whereby this shifting is motivated by the weight of the two relative to each other. In English verb phrases, heavier constituents tend to follow lighter constituents. The following examples illustrate shifting using pronouns, clauses, and PPs: ::She said that to her friends. ::She said to her friends that she had solved the problem. ::They hid that from me. ::They hid from me that I was going to pass the course. When the pronoun appears, it is much lighter than the PP, so it precedes the PP. But if the full clause appears, it is heavier than the PP and can therefore follow it. Further examples The syntactic category of the constituents involved in shifting is not limited; they can even be of the same type, e.g. ::It happened on Tuesday due to the weather. ::It happened due to the weather on Tuesday. ::Sam considers him a cheater. ::Sam considers a cheater anyone who used Wikipedia. In the first pair, the shifted constituents are PPs, and in the second pair, the shifted constituents are NPs. The second pair illustrates again that shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved; the NP anyone who used Wikipedia is heavier than the NP a cheater. The examples so far have shifting occurring in verb phrases. Shifting is not restricted to verb phrases. It can also occur, for instance, in NPs: ::the book on the shelf about linguistics ::the book about linguistics on the second shelf down from top ::the picture of him that I found ::the picture that I found of that old friend of mine with funny hair These examples again illustrate shifting that is motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The heavier of the two constituents prefers to appear further to the right. The example sentences above all have the shifted constituents appearing after their head (see below). Constituents that precede their head can also shift, e.g. ::Probably Susan left. ::Susan probably left. ::Certainly that happened more than once. ::That certainly happened more than once. Since the finite verb is viewed as the head of the clause in each case, these data allow an analysis in terms of shifting. The subject and modal adverb have swapped positions. In other languages that have many head-final structures, shifting in the pre-head domain is a common occurrence. Theoretical analyses If one assumes relatively flat structures, the analysis of many canonical instances of shifting is straightforward. Shifting occurs among two or more sister constituents that appear on the same side of their head.See Gro√ü and Osborne (2009: 66-71). The following trees illustrate the basic shifting constellation in a phrase structure grammar (= constituency grammar) first and in a dependency grammar second: ::Shifting (particle and object) The two constituency-based trees show a flat VP that allows n-ary branching (as opposed to just binary branching). The two dependency-based trees show the same VP. Regardless of whether one chooses the constituency- or the dependency-based analysis, the important thing about these examples is the relative flatness of the structure. This flatness results in a situation where shifting does not necessitate a discontinuity (i.e. no long distance dependency), for there can be no crossing lines in the trees. The following trees further illustrate the point: ::NP-internal shifting Again due to the flatness of structure, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. In this example, both orders are acceptable because there is little difference in the relative weight between the two constituents that switch positions. An alternative analysis of shifting is necessary in a constituency grammar that posits strictly binary branching structures.See for instance Larson (1988) and Kayne (1981, 1994). The more layered binary branching structures would result in crossing lines in the tree, which means movement (or copying) is necessary to avoid these crossing lines. The following trees are (merely) representative of the type of analysis that one might assume given strictly binary branching structures: ::Movement-analysis The analysis shown with the trees assumes binary branching and leftward movement only. Given these restrictions, two instances of movement might be necessary to accommodate the surface order seen in tree b. The material in light gray represents copies that must be deleted in the phonological component. This sort of analysis of shifting has been criticized by Ray Jackendoff, among others. See Jackendoff (1990) and Culicover and Jackendoff (2005) in this regard. Jackendoff and Culicover argue for an analysis like that shown with the flatter trees above, whereby heavy NP shift does not result from movement, but rather from a degree of optionality in the ordering of a verb's complements. The preferred order in English is for the direct object to follow the indirect object in a double-object construction, and for adjuncts to follow objects of all kinds; but if the direct object is \\"heavy\\", the opposite order may be preferred (since this leads to a more right-branching tree structure which is easier to process). A mystery From a generativist's perspective, a mysterious property of shifting is that in the case of ditransitive verbs, a shifted direct object prevents extraction of the indirect object via wh-movement: :: Who did you give the books written by the venerable Professor Plum to? :: *Who did you give to the books written by the venerable Professor Plum? Some generativists use this example to argue against the hypothesis that shifting merely results from choice between alternative complement orders, a hypothesis that does not imply movement. Their analysis in terms of a strictly binary branching tree resulting from leftward movements would in turn be able to explain this restriction. However, there are at least two ways of countering this argument: 1) in case one wants to explain choice, if choice is assumed to be performed between possible orders, the impossible order is not in the linguistic potential and it cannot be chosen; however, 2) in case one wants to explain generation, that is, to explain how a linguistic potential comes to exist in a situation, one can explain this phenomenon in terms of generation and avoidance rules: for instance, one of the reasons for avoiding a wording in potentiality would be an ordering in which a preposition falls before a nominal group by accident as in the example above. In other words, from a functional perspective, we either recognise that these fake clauses are none of the clauses we can choose from (choice of possible clauses) or we say that they are generated and avoided because they might cause listeners to misunderstand what the speaker is saying (generation and avoidance).

Two additional campaigns were conducted after the official end to the war on July 4, 1902 in connection with the Moro rebellion, which continued until 1913. Some other significant actions occurred outside of organized campaigns, both during the war itself and in the post-war period. During Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War The first battle of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War is the Battle of Manila in February, 1899, a few months after the December 1898 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and in which Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States. (The cession of the Philippines involved a payment of $20 million from the United States to the Spanish Empire.) The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War continued into 1902. Manila campaign (February 4 ‚Äì March 17, 1899) The Manila Campaign was conducted between, February 4 and March 17, 1899. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Emilio Aguinaldo (who had led an unsuccessful insurrection against Spain in 1896‚Äì97) organized a native army in the Philippines and secured control of several islands, including much of Luzon. Cession of the Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 via the Treaty of Paris disappointed many Filipinos, and on February 4, 1899 Aguinaldo's followers clashed with American troops. The Americans, numbering about 12,000 combat troops under Major General Elwell Otis, defeated Aguinaldo's force of some 40,000 men and suppressed an attempted uprising in Manila. American columns pushed north, east, and south from Manila to split the insurgent forces and seize key towns. The column pushing north, commanded by Major General Arthur MacArthur, captured the town of Caloocan.. The column pushing east, commanded by Brigadier General Loyd Wheaton, pushed out of Manila and gained control of the Pasig River, which connects Laguna de Bay to Manila Bay, permanently interrupting communications between insurgent forces in north and south Luzon.. The column pushing south, commanded by Brigadier General Henry Lawton, was tasked with a long raid along Laguna de Bay; its mission assignment was limited because of manpower shortages due to primacy of the northern theater.. The Manila campaign split the Filipino forces in two, one section north and the other south of Manila, joined only by a narrow corridor running through the towns of Pasig, Pateros, Taguig and Muntinlupa between American lines and the shore of Laguna de Bay. This denied Aguinaldo direct control of Filipino forces south of Manila, in the most revolutionary provinces of Batangas, Laguna and Cavite. Antonio Luna continued as commander of the northern section, and Aguinaldo appointed Mariano Tr√≠as commander of the southern section.. =Significant battles: Manila campaign= * Battle of Manila (February 4‚Äì5, 1899): American and Filipino forces clash and the Americans drive the Filipino army out of the Manila area. * Battle of Caloocan (February 10, 1899) American troops under General Arthur MacArthur capture the town of Caloocan north of Manila, securing the southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway (the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan) and capturing a significant amount of rolling stock. * Second Battle of Caloocan (February 22‚Äì24, 1899) Failed Filipino counterattack. Iloilo campaign (February 8‚Äì12, 1899) The Iloilo campaign was conducted between February 8 and 12, 1899. Although control of Luzon was the principal military objective in 1899, measures were also taken to establish American control over other important islands. Iloilo on Panay island was occupied on February 11, Cebu City on the island of Cebu on February 26, Bacolod on Negros on March 10, and Jolo in the Sulu Archipelago on May 19. US forces, consisting of General Marcus P. Miller's brigade and Capt. Frank F. Wilde's naval squadron, took Iloilo from Filipino forces under General Martin Delgado, Panay's Federal State of the Visayas, and Ananias Diokno, leaving the city a \\"blackened ruin\\".. The city was destroyed by a \\"combination of arson, naval bombardment, and street fighting\\".. Brig. Gen. James F. Smith arrived Bacolod on 4 March as the Military Governor of the Sub-district of Negros, after receiving an invitation from the president of the provisional government, Aniceto Lacson.. Commodore George Dewey ordered the Petrel, under the command of Capt. Charles F. Cornwell, into Cebu City's harbor on 21 Feb., followed by Elwell S. Otis assigning on 14 March, troops from the 23rd Infantry, under Maj. Greenleaf A. Goodale, and Lt. Col. Thomas R. Hamer as military governor for the Cebu subdistrict of the Visayas Military District.. Malolos campaign (March 24 ‚Äì August 16, 1899) On March 17, 1899, General Otis reorganized his 8th Corps, breaking it into a defensive force for Manila and an offensive force to pursue operations against Aguinaldo's forces north of Manila.. The Malolos campaign was conducted between March 24 and August 16, 1899. General MacArthur's column advanced along the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan railroad to the north. Malolos the capital of the insurgent First Philippine Republic government, was the first objective. MacArthur's column captured Malolos on March 31, but Aguinaldo had decamped and transferred his capital to San Fernando, Pampanga on the same day.For the date of the transfer of the Philippine Republic capital to San Fernando, see . on May 5, and the stronghold of San Isidro, Nueva Ecija (which was held only temporarily) on May 15. The advantage gained through capture of Malolos was exploited by advancing to Angeles, which was captured on August 16. MacArthur sent one brigade up the Manila‚ÄìDagupan railway line while another brigade forded the Quingua River and moved up a wagon road to the west. Otis intended for Lawton to advance west to Baliuag as a blocking force, but Lawton believed he was to move north to Norzagaray to draw Filipino forces away from a defense of Luna's stronghold at Calumpit.. At Calumpit, where Luna's main force was located, thousands of laborers had strengthened the formidable natural defenses with trenches roofed by steel rails or boilerplate for protection from shrapnel and the construction of breastworks at several points. Some 4,000 soldiers defended Calumpit itself, with another 3,000 guarding the flank at Baliuag., citing , , and . Luna had deployed much of his army along the railway line south of Calumpit, and on the night of April 10‚Äì11 he launched a series of assaults on garrisons along the railroad, driving the Americans back but failing to rout them.. Otis had intended to launch his offensive on April 24, but action began a day early, on April 23, when American scouts examining the approaches to Quingua were pinned down. Battle developed as American forces were committed to support the scouts. American forces overran Quingua in fierce fighting on April 23 and 24, putting them in position to threaten Calumpit.. On April 25, American forces assaulted Luna's stronghold, which fell after a day of heavy fighting. The American advance northwards stopped at Calumpit while negotiations aimed at ending hostilities were conducted. Colonel Manuel Arguelles, representing Aguinaldo, arrived in Lawton's camp to request a three-week armistice for Aguinaldo to call together his scattered government to discuss terms. Lawton sent him on to Otis, who refused a truce but did wire Lawton and MacArthur to hold their positions.. On May 2, Aguinaldo's representatives proposed a three- month cease-fire, couched in language which required Otis to acknowledge the Philippine Republic as a sovereign nation. Otis refused the truce on those terms, but gave the delegate a copy of President McKinley's plan for a Philippine civil government, which would include an advisory council and judiciary selected from Americans and Filipinos.For more information, see History of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946)#First Philippine Commission and Schurman Commission. Aguinaldo's delegates were won over. Aguinaldo's cabinet headed by hard-liner Apolinario Mabini was ousted and replaced with a \\"Peace cabinet\\" headed by Pedro Paterno, which sent the delegates back to Manila to discuss surrender terms with Otis. General Luna, however, arrested the delegates and Paterno's cabinet and restored Mabini and the hardliners. Negotiations collapsed, and Otis resumed his offensive. American forces resumed military action, capturing San Fernando, Pampanga on May 4., but by that time the capitol of the insurgent Philippine Republic had moved to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. Between February 4 and May 4, MacArthur's troops had pushed American lines over 40 miles north. Their supply lines were in shambles and barely half the troops were still fit for active duty. Exhausted American troops recuperated in San Fernando for the rest of May and MacArthur's forces solidified their control of the railroad corridor linking San Fernando to Manila. =Significant battles: Malolos campaign= * Battle of the Tuliahan river (March 25, 1899) ‚Äì an unsupported frontal assault against a well prepared and heavily defended position.. * Battle of the Meycauayan bridge (March 26, 1899) ‚Äì a bloody battle in which MacArthur's forces advancing northwards along the railway line killed over 90 Filipino soldiers.. * Battle of Malinta (March 26, 1899) ‚Äì An American unit entered the town of Malinta and found defensive positions there deserted. Once in the town, they came under a hail of fire. Captain John Ballance rallied the troops and led the battalion in an assault that turned a potential slaughter into a victory.. For that action, Ballance was breveted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. (full text available online. See p.5 of the e-book) * Battle of Marilao River (March 27, 1899) ‚Äì in one of the most celebrated river crossings of the war, American forces crossed the Marilao river (80 yards wide and too deep to ford) while under fire from the opposite bank.. * Battle of the Bocaue river (March 29, 1899) ‚Äì American forces were ambushed in midcrossing at the river northwest of the town of Bocaue, Bulacan, taking 29 casualties in ten minutes.. * Capture of Malolos (March 31, 1899) ‚Äì Malolos, northwest of Bocaoe, was taken by American forces unopposed. As the troops entered the town, buildings on all sides burst into flame, having been ignited by retreating Filipino forces under General Antonio Luna. When the fires were spent, the town was gutted. * Battle of Quingua (April 23, 1899) ‚Äì Filipino General Gregorio del Pilar stops American cavalry scouts on Luzon, but is then routed after an artillery bombardment and infantry ground assault. U.S. Colonel John M. Stotsenburg killed in battle. * Battle of Calumpit, (April 25, 1899) ‚Äì American forces assault the heavily defended stronghold across a wide river, overrunning it after a day of heavy fighting. Laguna de Bay campaign (April 8‚Äì17, 1899) Cascoes being towed by the Laguna de Bay In March, Brig. Gen. Loyd Wheaton's forces had fought its way through Pasig, Pateros and Taguig along the Marikina, Taguig and Pasig Rivers to Laguna de Bay, cutting the Filipino army into northern and southern components and allowing gunboats to patrol the lake.. The Laguna de Bay campaign was conducted between April 8 and 17, 1899. While MacArthur's column had been hammering the insurgents along the railroad to the north, Major General Henry Lawton took his column south, captured Santa Cruz in the Laguna de Bay area on April 10, and returned to Manila on April 17.. Otis recalled Lawton from the Laguna de Bay Campaign despite Lawton's desire to capture the town of Calamba.. As Lawton's forces departed, they could see Filipino troops reoccupying Santa Cruz.. Significant battles: Laguna de Bay campaign * Battle of Santa Cruz (April 9 ‚Äì 10, 1899) ‚Äì U.S. General Henry W. Lawton captures Filipino stronghold of Santa Cruz and pushes into Laguna province on Luzon. * Battle of Pagsanjan (April 11, 1899) ‚Äì American sharpshooters skirmish with Filipinos outside of Pagsanjan, succeeding in driving them out. General Lawton's troops take Pagsanjan in the second action of the Laguna Campaign. * Battle of Paete (April 12, 1899) ‚Äì General Lawton's forces disperse Filipinos blocking route to Paete in a stiff fight, taking Paete. This was the last action of the Laguna Campaign. First San Isidro campaign (April 21 ‚Äì May 30, 1899) The first San Isidro campaign was conducted between April 21 and May 30, 1899. MacArthur's forces, Lawton commanding the 1st Brigade and Irving Hale the 2nd Brigade, captured Calumpit on 25 April and soon crossed the Rio Grande despite Luna's formidable defenses manned by 4,000 soldiers.. Yet, MacArthur's offensive stalled after capturing San Fernando on 5 May.. Lawton's troops captured Norzagaray, Bulacan on April 25 and Angat, Bulacan on 27 April.. After a pause while negotiations were underway in Manila, Lawton resumed his advance, and captured San Rafael, Baliuag and Bustos on 2 May.. At Balawag on May 7, Lawton issued General Field Order No. 8, which authorized the creation of the first local government under the Americans as follows: Waiting to advance until 11 May, Lawton's force took San Miguel on 16 May, and San Isidro on May 17.. Aguinaldo and fragments of the insurgent Philippine Republic government had fled to Tarlac. =Significant battles: First San Isidro campaign= * Battle of San Isidro, on May 16, 1899, American scouts reconnoitering the approaches to San Isidro discovered and engaged large Filipino force burning a bridge. Four of the scouts charged over the bridge and engaged the Filipinos, while the rest forded the river, beat out the flames, and saved the bridge. The next day, American forces crossed the bridge and captured San Isidro, which had been the temporary seat of Aguinaldo's insurgent government. Aguinaldo had already left before the town fell, however, taking with him 13 American captives. Zapote River campaign (June 13, 1899) The Zapote River campaign was completed in a single day, June 13, 1899, and consisted largely of a single battle. Operations in Luzon in mid-1899 had halted for the rainy season.. During this pause the first Philippine Scouts units were organized and large numbers of additional troops began to arrive, bringing the strength of the American force (Eighth Army Corps) to some 47,500 men by the end of the year and 75,000 a year later. Following the murder of Luna, Aguinaldo had about 4,000 soldiers, mostly located along the Manila-Dagupan railroad, under the command of Tomas Mascardo, Servillano Aquino and Luciano San Miguel in Pampanga; Pio del Pilar and Urbano Lacuna in Bulacan, Francisco Macabulos in Tarlac; Gregorio del Pilar in Pangasinan; Manuel Tinio in Ilocano; and Daniel Tirona in the Cagayan Valley.. * Battle of Zapote Bridge (June 13, 1899) ‚Äì In one of the hardest- fought engagements of the war, Lawton's forces routed a large Filipino force under General P√≠o del Pilar, and inflicted heavy casualties in the second largest battle of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Naval Blockade and Treaty Admiral John C. Watson on 19 Aug., initiated a blockade of \\"any vessel flying the Philippine Republic's flag, any vessel trading with closed ports or any vessel laded with contraband of war\\".. The navy used 25 seagoing gunboats, complementary to the army's 10 river steamers, which were armed with cannons and machine guns, and stationed them at Zamboanga, Cebu, Iloilo and Vigan.. On 20 Aug., Brig. Gen. John C. Bates and the Sultan of Sulu signed a treaty in which the Sultan accepted American sovereignty, allowing the U.S. to garrison Jolo, Zamboanga and Siassi.. Cavite campaign (October 7 and 13, 1899) The Cavite campaign was conducted between October 7 and 13, 1899. In October 1899, organized resistance in Cavite and adjacent provinces was destroyed by forces under General Lawton, Col. William Bisbee, and Brig. Gen. Theodore Schwan.. In the same month, General Otis launched a three-pronged offensive in North Luzon directed at Aguinaldo's remaining forces. Perhaps as a diversion, Filipino forces south of Manila had attacked Calamba and Los Ba√±os in Laguna and Imus and Bacoor in Cavite in late 1899. In order to free troops to join the advance north, Otis moved to \\"attack and severely punish these Cavite insurgents\\". Lawton headed south with three columns. One column swept the lines between Imus and Bacoor and along Laguna de Bay, a second moved along the west shore of Manila Bay, with warships providing fire support, and a third advanced down a narrow peninsula from the Cavite naval station to Novaleta. Second San Isidro campaign (October 10 ‚Äì November 20, 1899) A second San Isidro campaign was conducted between October 10 and November 20, 1899. Lawton's column moved up the Pampanga River, recaptured San Isidro on October 20, and entered San Fabian, Pangasinan on the Lingayen Gulf on November 18. The advance was spearheaded on 10 Oct. by a brigade under General Samuel Young, aided by Matthew Batson's Macabebe Scouts and the Lowe Scouts, which entered Arayat on the 12th and reentered San Isidro on October 20.. Young pressed northeast towards Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, a city reputed to hold two dozen American and 4,000 Spanish prisoners of war, advancing slowly over difficult terrain.. After Cabanatuan, Young took a Cavalry Brigade of 1,100 men, including the Macabebes, onwards to San Jose on 12 Nov., Umangan on 13 Nov., and then the passes at Tayug and San Nicholas on 16 Nov.. Young captured San Fernando de la Union on 20 Nov., with the aid of the Samar, while the Oregon occupied Vigan.. Tarlac campaign (November 5‚Äì20, 1899) The Tarlac campaign was conducted between November 5 and 20, 1899. MacArthur's forces advanced through the Central Luzon plain, seized Tarlac on November 12, and reached Dagupan on November 20. On November 5, MacArthur's forces, Col. Jacob H. Smith's 17th Infantry, J. Franklin Bell's 36th, and Joseph Wheeler's 9th and 12th Infantry, began clearing out the countryside between his garrison at Angeles and Arayat, Pampanga in Pampanga, and intending to advance onwards to Bamban, Tarlac.. Though hampered by a typhoon which caused rivers to rise ten feet and washed out roads, the forces entered the town of Tarlac on November 12.. After delaying four days to repair washed-out roads and bring up supplies, a 900-man task force crossed a half-mile washout on November 17 and occupied Bayambang, Pangasinan on November 19 and entered Dagupan the next day.. Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Grant later captured Subic Bay.. San Fabian campaign (November 6‚Äì19, 1899) The San Fabian campaign was conducted between November 6 and 19, 1899. General Wheaton, with Bisbee's 13th Infantry and Luther Hare's 33 Infantry, sailed from Manila on the 6th, landed at San Fabian (November 7), routed insurgents at San Jacinto (November 11),. and linked up with MacArthur's column at Dagupan on November 20. =Significant battles: San Fabian campaign= * Battle of San Jacinto (November 11, 1899) ‚Äì U.S. General Loyd Wheaton drives Filipinos out of San Jacinto, Luzon. Cagayan Valley (Dec. 1899) Comdr. Bowman H. McCalla accepted the surrender of Daniel Tirona's forces at Aparri, Cagayan, on 11 Dec. McCalla then rendezvoused with Capt. Joseph Batchelor's 24th Infantry, Buffalo Soldiers, on 13 Dec.. Following the Battle of Tangadan Pass on 4 Dec.,Westfall, M., 2012, The Devil's Causeway, Guilford: Lyons Press, Col. Luther Hare's 220 men of the 33rd Infantry headed south, while Lt. Col. Robert Lee Howze's 130 men of the 34th Infantry headed north, and succeeded in freeing several hundred Spanish, and 26 American prisoners, including Lt. James Gillmore's men of the Siege of Baler, from Manuel Tinio's Brigade by 18 Dec.Sonnichsen, A., 1901, Ten Months a Captive Among Filipinos, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons Significant actions outside of campaigns =Pursuit of Aguinaldo (1899)= On October 31, 2nd Division scouts intercepted a message from Aguinaldo dated October 5, declaring that he was shifting his capital to Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.. Elements from the Second San Isidro campaign and the San Fabian campaign reacted to this unexpected circumstance in an attempt to capture him. Aguinaldo, retreating before MacArthur's advancing troops, had left his latest temporary capital in Tarlac and moved north up the railroad to Bayombong. At a November 13 conference, he decided to disperse his army and begin guerrilla war, then rode the train north 20 miles and set off across country for Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, 12 miles to the east. Aguinaldo was met en route by General Gregorio del Pilar, swelling his party to over 1,200. Aguinaldo reached Pozorrubio on November 14, but his rear guard had been attacked by pursuing American troops and his mother and son captured. When the American troops entered Pozorrubio the next morning, Aguinaldo had already left. Recognizing that American troops blocked his escape east, Aguinaldo turned north and west on November 15, crossing the mountains into La Union province. Lawton wanted to send Young north to intercept Aguinaldo, but Otis ordered Lawton to advance no further north than San Jose, Nueva Ecija, and to dispatch troops to seal off passes to the east.. With permission from Lawton, Young proceeded north from Cabanatuan on 7 November with an 1,100-man cavalry brigade, towards Tayug, Pangasinan, intending to block Aguinaldo's escape route.. Aguinaldo's escape north from Pozorrubio should have been blocked by a force under General Wheaton which had left Manila by sea on November 6 and arrived in San Fabian, Pangasinan the next day.. Shortly after that force came ashore, however, a typhoon struck, flooded the countryside, and made movement almost impossible. Wheaton was not able to send troops to Pozorrubio until November 16, the day after Aguinaldo had left. Having dispersed his army, Aguinaldo was no longer limited to routes able to accommodate a large force. He could now travel rapidly in small parties, and his destination was more difficult for pursuing American forces to predict.. On November 17, Aguinaldo reached Naguilian, La Union. Young, suspecting that Aguinaldo was moving up the west coast and that he might turn eastwards at Candon, Ilocos Sur, in the direction of the Tirad Pass, sent Peyton C. March's battalion to block the pass.. On December 2, that battalion engaged Aguinaldo's rear guard in the Battle of Tirad Pass, in which General Gregario del Pilar was killed. Aguinaldo had escaped through the pass. At the time of the battle, Aguinaldo and his party were encamped in Cervantes, about 10 km south of the pass. After being notified by a rider of the outcome of the battle and the death of Del Pilar, Aguinaldo ordered that camp be broken, and departed with his party for Cayan settlement.. * Battle of Tirad Pass (December 2, 1899) ‚Äì In Luzon, 60 Filipinos under General Gregorio del Pilar hold off 500 American infantrymen for five hours in a delaying action to ensure General Emilio Aguinaldo's escape.. Nearly all are killed, including del Pilar. Aquinaldo was then on the move in the mountains until Sept. 1900, when he established his headquarters in Palanan.. Maj. Gen. Pantaleon Garcia, revolutionary commander of Central Luzon, was captured in May 1900, while Gen. Servillano Aquino, Francisco Macabulos, and Pio del Pilar surrendered in June.. =Other significant battles, campaign and expedition (1899‚Äì1900)= * Battle of Paye (December 19, 1899) ‚Äì In Luzon Filipino General Licerio Ger√≥nimo's forces kill General Lawton. * Cavite, Batangas, Tayabas, and Laguna campaign (Jan. 1900) ‚Äì Otis' campaign in the southern Tagalog provinces, sent Col.

Escorted by the Helena, Nashville, and Mariveles, steam launches would tow a line of boats loaded with soldiers to shore, capturing Sorsogon City, Calbayog, Catbalogan, Tacloban, and Ormoc.. At the time, Philippine Republic generals controlling the associated provinces were Vicente Lukban on Samar, Ambrosio Moxica on Leyte, and Vito Belarmino on Bicol.. * Siege of Catubig (April 15, 1900) ‚Äì Filipino guerrillas launch a surprise attack against a detachment of American soldiers and after a four-day siege, forced them to evacuate the town of Catubig in Samar. * Battle of Makahambus Hill (June 4, 1900) ‚Äì On Makahambus Hill, in Cagayan de Misamis, Northern Mindanao (present day Cagayan de Oro), Filipinos rout an American regiment and inflict heavy casualties, but take less than five casualties of their own. It is the only known major victory by Filipino forces in Mindanao. * Battle of Pulang Lupa (September 13, 1900) ‚Äì On the island of Marinduque, Filipino forces under Colonel Maximo Abad ambush a force of 52 American infantrymen under Captain Devereux Shields. * Battle of Mabitac (September 17, 1900) ‚Äì Filipino forces outmaneuver and rout American forces in Luzon. =Capture of Aguinaldo (1901)= Several revolutionary leaders surrendered in 1901. On 10 Jan., Mart√≠n Te√≥filo Delgado surrendered on Panay, and on 29 March, Nicolas Capistrano in northern Mindanao and Mariano Trias in Southern Luzon on 13 May.. Manuel Tinio and Jose Alejandrino surrendered on 29 April, Lacuna on 19 May, Juan Cailles on 24 June, Moxica surrendered in Leyte on 18 May, and Belarmino on 4 July.. On March 23, 1901 General Frederick Funston and his troops captured Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, with the help of some Filipinos (called the Macabebe Scouts after their home locale) who had joined the Americans' side. The Americans pretended to be captives of the Scouts, who were dressed in Philippine Army uniforms. Once Funston and his \\"captors\\" entered Aguinaldo's camp, they immediately fell upon the guards and quickly overwhelmed them and the weary Aguinaldo.. On April 1, 1901, at the Malaca√±an Palace in Manila, Aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. On April 19, he issued a Proclamation of Formal Surrender to the United States, telling his followers to lay down their weapons and give up the fight.. \\"Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation,\\" Aguinaldo said. \\"The lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which I realized only recently, leads me to the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well-being of the Philippines.\\". =Other significant battles (1901)= * Lonoy massacre (March 1901) ‚Äì In a reverse ambush, U.S. infantrymen launch a surprise attack on Bohol natives and kill over 400. * Balangiga massacre (September 28, 1901) Townspeople and guerrillas virtually annihilated the American garrison in Balangiga. * March across Samar (November 1901) Ending the war in 1902 Not all of the insurgent leaders had responded to Aguinaldo's acceptance of the United States authority and his call for an end to the fighting, but by July 1901 only Miguel Malvar in Batangas and Vincente Lukban in Samar still led forces capable of resisting American control. Malvar took over as President of the Philippine Republic as designated in Aguinaldo's decreed line of succession. He reorganized Filipino forces in southern Luzon and renamed the combined armed forces, which possessed around 10,000 rifles at the time, \\"Army of Liberation\\". He also reorganized the regional departments of the Republic, which included the Marianas as a separate province. Lukban was captured in February 1902 and Malvar on 16 April.. American President Theodore Roosevelt unilaterally declared the insurrection at an end on July 4, 1902.. His official issuance, however, was a proclamation of general amnesty for persons who had participated in or supported Philippine insurrections against the U.S., and explicitly excluded parts of the territory \\"inhabited by Moro tribes\\". On April 9, 2002, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed that the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War had ended on April 16, 1902 with the surrender of General Malvar. Post-war period Mindanao campaign (July 4, 1902 - December 31, 1904 and October 22, 1905) The Mindanao campaign was conducted between July 4, 1902 and December 31, 1904, and included other action on October 22, 1905. In 1902 serious trouble began with the Moros, Muslim people in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, who had never been completely subjugated by the Spanish. When the Army occupied former Spanish garrison points, the Moros began to raid villages, attack soldiers, and otherwise resist American jurisdiction. Between July 1902 and December 1904, and again late in 1905, the Army dispatched a series of expeditions into the interior of Mindanao to destroy Moro strongholds. Col. Frank D. Baldwin with some 1,000 men (including elements of his own 27th Infantry and a mountain battery) invaded the territory of the Sultan of Bayan near Lake Lanao and defeated the Sultan's forces in the hotly contested Battle of Bayan on May 2, 1902. Capt. John J. Pershing headed a similar expedition into the Lanao country in 1903, and Capt. Frank R. McCoy finally killed the notorious Moro outlaw, Dato Ali, in the Cotabato district in October 1905. =Significant battles: Mindanao campaign= * Battle of Dolores River (December 12, 1904) ‚Äì In Samar, 37 Philippine Constabulary Scouts are ambushed by 1,000 Pulahans and nearly all are killed. Jolo campaign (May 1-24, 1905, 6 -March 8, 1906 and June 11-15, 1913) The Jolo campaign was conducted in three segments, May 1-24, 1905, 6-March 8, 1906 and June 11-15, 1913. In May 1905, March 1906, and June 1913, Regulars had to cope with disorders too extensive to be handled by the local constabulary and Philippine Scouts on the island of Jolo, a Moro stronghold. During May 1905, followers of a Sulu Moro leader named Pala gathered in a volcanic crater and surrendered to American forces. On March 6, 7, and 8, 1906 the battle of Bud Dajo was fought to a successful conclusion by Regulars and in mid-June 1913 Moros at Bagsac were whipped.. =Significant battles: Jolo campaign= * First Battle of Bud Dajo (March 5-7, 1906) ‚Äì One thousand Moros (including women and children) fortify themselves in an extinct volcanic crater on Mindanao and battle several hundred American soldiers, before virtually all are killed. * Second Battle of Bud Dajo (December 1911) ‚Äì In a five-day battle, an estimated 1500 Moros fortified the top of the extinct volcano. General John J. Pershing, through negotiations, succeeded in persuading the majority of the assembled Moros to return home. The remaining Moro forces, led by a chieftain named Jailani, were either killed or captured in the battle.

He began his service in mounted infantry and transferred to a machine gun unit. He was entrusted with a commission while still only 19 years old. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, where his courage won him a Military Cross, awarded him on the day he was killed in action. Early life Kenneth William Junor was the son of Alice E. and William Junor. The younger Junor was born on 3 August 1896 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He served in the 4th Mounted Rifles of the militia prior to enlisting into the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 24 July 1915 to serve in the First World War. At the time of his enlistment as a private into the 75th (Mississauga) Battalion, CEF, he was a third year student at Toronto University serving in the 9th Mounted Horse of the militia. The annotation on his enlistment papers that he was being recruited as an officer seems to indicate he was already being considered for a commission. His physical examination noted that he was 5 feet 8 1/2 inches tall, fair complected, with brown hair and blue eyes. World War I In March 1916, Junor was shipped to England as a lieutenant in the 11th Machine Gun Company of the Canadian Machine Gun Corps. In July 1916, he was forwarded to serve on the Western Front. He served during the Battle of the Somme, and was stricken with fever. After his recovery, he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, on 28 July 1917. In December 1917, after training, he was posted to No. 56 Squadron as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot. Between 29 January and 20 April 1918, using planes he dubbed Bubbly Kid and Bubbly Kid II, he would set two German aircraft afire in midair, destroy three others, and drive down three more down out of control. On 23 April 1918, Junor fell victim to German ace Egon Koepsch of Jagdstaffel 4, who shot him down at Bray- sur-Somme.

Johnston had been claimed for the US in 1858, Palmyra in 1859; both under the Guano Islands Act. Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese navy forces attacked Allied possessions across the Pacific, including Johnston and Palmyra.  Background  Both islands had been obtained through the Guano Islands Act of 1856, although Palmyra was void of guano. The lack of guano caused Palmyra to pass through the ownership of many different groups throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Johnston and Palmyra were placed under US Navy control in 1934 by President Franklin Roosevelt. Both islands were garrisoned and Johnston served as a refueling station for passing US Navy ships. Although an airfield was under construction on Johnston, the only aircraft present on the island were Navy PBY patrol planes, usually anchored offshore. Johnston became noticeable to the Japanese command because of its location. Although it was too close to Hawaii to be amphibiously assaulted, it was near the major Japanese air base in the Marshall Islands. The executive officer of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion, Major Francis B. Loomis Jr., had arrived on Johnston on December 7, 1941. He had been returning by air from an inspection of the American outposts in the Pacific when Pearl Harbor had been attacked. He then took control of the island's garrison. Following news of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the civilian contractors already present on Johnston began to building more emplacements for the Marines' guns and positions. Six US Navy ships were also on Johnston, practicing their use of the Higgins Boat on Johnston's shore. For the next few days, there was very little activity around both islands.  The attacks  The first attack on the islands came on December 12, 1941. A Japanese submarine, 8,000 yards offshore, broke the surface and fired star shells clusters over Johnston. The US Marine crews of 5-inch coastal guns tried to find the submarine with star shells, after which the submarine withdrew. On the night of December 15, a US Navy supply ship, William Ward Burrows, arrived at dusk to drop off supplies destined for Marines stranded on Wake, and to retrieve civilian contractors and return to Pearl Harbor. Crew members of Burrows and Marines on Johnston spotted a flash at sea. The first bracket of shells landed on Johnston and at least one hit the powerhouse, causing a fire that engulfed the building. The Marines returned fire for ten minutes until the submarine ceased firing. An attack by a Japanese submarine on the night of December 21 resembled the events on December 12. A final attack came on the 22nd, when a Japanese submarine fired a star shell cluster and six shells at Johnston knocking down a homing tower and wounding a Marine. Fire from Marine-crewed coastal batteries forced the submarine to submerge. The sole attack on Palmyra (located 900 miles southeast of Johnston) came near dawn on December 24, 1941. A Japanese submarine fired on Palmyra and a US Navy dredge, Sacramento, which sat in the atoll's lagoon. The shells did minor damage to the Sacramento before the submarine was driven back by fire from Marine-crewed 5-inch guns.  Aftermath  Maj. James Masters, USMC on Johnston, 1942Following the Japanese naval attacks on Johnston and Palmyra, both were heavily reinforced. Johnston was given more heavy guns, machine guns, and an infantry company. Similar precautions were taken with Palmyra. Although they were isolated, the Marine, Navy, and civilian garrisons became the front line of Pearl Harbor's defense while it recuperated. Both islands continued to be garrisoned by Marines throughout the war.

Language As of 2002 there were about 15,500 speakers of the Holoholo language. The name \\"Holoholo\\" was given to them by the Belgians. It comes from the sound of their greeting, which outsiders found comical. The alternative name \\"Kalanga\\" simply means people who were there before the current population. History Holoholo statuette of a woman from the 19th century or early 20th century The Holoholo are a matrilineal people. They are descendants of Baguha people who fled from the Luba Empire when it was expanding eastward in the 18th century, settling around Kalemie where the Lukuga River leaves the lake. During the period of Luba dominance that followed the eastward expansion under Luba king Ilunga Sungu around 1800, bambudye secret societies were introduced among the Holoholo and other peoples, propagating oral traditions of the Luba royal family. The Holoholo adopted and adapted the Luba genesis myth, in which they believed there was a mountain called Ilunga Sungu on the west side of the Lualaba towards the Luba heartland, This refers to the location of the court of Ilunga Sungu at Katende. The 1935 book Les peuplades du Congo belge shows the Holoholo living on both sides of the Lukuga. They became middlemen in the Arab and African slave trade. With suppression of this trade the economy collapsed and disease and local warfare decimated the population. Today the economy is mostly agricultural based on sorghum, maize, peanuts, and beans. Fish are caught with nets, dried and sold locally, the main source of cash in the area. Sorghum is used to make beer. The Holoholo who live in Tanzania around Kungwe Mountain have a tradition that their ancestors came from the Congo side by means of a long island that continued Kungwe Mountain into the lake. The lake level is highly variable, so it is conceivable that they crossed at a time when it was much lower than today, when part of the ridge separating the northern and southern basins of the lake would have been exposed. Thousands of Holoholo had settled along the Tanganyikan side of the lake by 1915, having sailed over in canoes. A census in 1948 counted 4,410 Holoholo in Tanganyika. In 1987 the Holoholo people had an estimated population of 12,500 in Tanzania. They traditionally lived in the Mahale Mountains on the east shore of the lake opposite Kalemie. However they were expelled from this area after 1979 to make way for the Mahale Mountains National Park created in 1985.

The fire lasted almost two months and has permanently left two giant craters in the ground leaving \\"Two Mouths\\"  History of oil in Veracruz  Foreign oil extraction which began in 1900 was dominated by American and European powers alike. Each time one of these new powers entered an area, like Veracruz, they would ultimately disrupt the local wildlife, alter the landscape, and affect how society was structured as well. The oil companies would then make their own type of society that would not only affect how people would interact with each other, but how the locals would interact with the environment around them as well. A major factor that changed their society was that the oil companies were able to put a price on the locals land. This made the people uneasy at the time and did not trust the companies at first, but with very high offers on their land, the people could not refuse. Once they acquired the land, they built major infrastructure like wells, refineries, living quarters for the workers, etc.. At first the companies were hesitant in laying down pipelines, until it started to rain oil form the wells. Oil would cover entire areas with this black gold they have found and when they would work on installing the pipelines, oil would still rain down from the wells. These open wells, or pits, as they called them would reach depths as much as seven to thirty feet deep. Having these pits open would be a dangerous move on the oil companies because they could easily catch fire at any moment.  The fire  In 1901 the Pennsylvania Oil Company, of Mexico, bought the land rights and drilled a well into the nearby lagoon called Dos Bocas, with no success in completely drilling the well. The English division of S. Pearsons and Son then acquired the land rights in 1908 and decided to continue drilling the well in the lagoon. During the drilling process, the pressure in the well became powerful enough to burst through the ground, gushing oil out of the well. Pressure in the well was so great that it blew a second hole nearby. The oil was then ignited by the flames that powered the oil derrick that was lifting the drill. The fire was so bright that it could be seen 200 miles away from the ocean. Ultimately, the Dos Bocas blowout ended up being one of the largest oil spills in the history of the oil industry. It was impossible to stop the flow of oil because the well casing had been blown off during the gush. The well itself kept pouring out oil at a rate of 90,000 barrels per day. The fire lasted almost two months from July 4 1908 to August 30 1908 The heat exacerbated the difficulties workers faced when trying to stop the flow of oil. Temperatures were high which caused those working to put out the fire and contain the spill to be unable to go closer than a few hundred feet. The oil coming out was a column and the fire burned at over . away from the fire, town residents said that they were able to read a newspaper at night by the light of the flames. Extinguishing the flames was not an easy task. With the lack of technology to put out this enormous fire, the Mexican government sent 400 soldiers to combat against the fire. Oil was leaking out into the nearby fields and swamps and had to act as fast as they can. The soldiers used a centrifugal pump to suck the oil out and used 3,000 tons of gravel and sand to snuff the fire out. After the fire was extinguished by naturally losing its oil, two billion gallons of oils that was worth twenty five million dollars leaked from the well.

At the time, North Carolina had adopted laws restricting the ability of slaveowners to free their slaves. To get around these laws individual Quakers began entrusting their slaves to their church. The Quaker organization held on to the slaves in conditions of virtual freedom, until it could obtain the legal freedom of the slave. While this method of freeing slaves was initially popular, the practice fell into disuse as a result of demographic and political reasons. Background During the eighteenth century, the North Carolina General Assembly adopted tight restrictions on manumission. In 1723, the Assembly prohibited slave owners from freeing their slaves, unless as a reward for \\"meritorious service\\".Weeks, Stephen Beauregard, Southern Quakers and Slavery: A Study in Institutional History, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, (1896), p.217-244 This restriction was reaffirmed in 1741, 1777 and finally in 1796. By the beginning of the nineteenth century it was the most restrictive law of its kind in the states of the Upper South.Berlin, Ira, Slaves Without Masters: The Free Negro in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, London and New York, (1974) p.29-35; 140-144 As a result of these restrictive policies many North Carolinians interested in emancipation, especially Quakers, made active attempts to circumvent the law by emancipating their slaves. The Quakers of North Carolina committed themselves to rid their community of slave ownership. At the 1782 Yearly Meeting, the leaders of the community required their members to emancipate all their slaves. This policy of manumission ran into direct conflict with the laws of North Carolina. . As a result, the Quakers actively sought a way to emancipate slaves. Using Trusts to Emancipate Adoption of Trustee Device In 1808 many North Carolinians were using trusts as a way to manumit slaves without breaking North Carolina's restrictive laws. A master simply entrusted his or her slave to a trustee, who was responsible for providing the slave with his or her freedom. The trust would specify the manner by which the trustee could fulfill his or her obligations. Some trusts required the trustee to remove the slave to a state with less restrictive manumission laws and where the slave could be formally emancipated. Others required the trustee to free the slave in North Carolina by proving \\"meritorious service\\" in the proper court. Finally, many trusts required the trustee to hold the slave until North Carolina law permitted emancipation. The end goal of all these efforts was to avoid improper manumission and the possibility of re-enslavement.Cover, Robert, Justice Accused: Antislavery and the Judicial Process, Yale University Press, New Haven and New York, (1975), p.75-82 At the 1808 Yearly Meeting the Quakers decided to use trusts to collect slaves. A 1796, statute passed by the General Assembly, permitted religious organizations to appoint trustees to hold for the congregation any real estate and donations \\"of whatever kind\\". The Quakers interpreted this to include the holding of slaves in trust.Franklin, John H, The Free Negro in North Carolina, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill and London, (1971) p. 10-25 To support this conclusion, the North Carolina Friends asked the respected jurist, William Gaston for his legal opinion. According to Gaston, the \\"donations of property such as money, slaves, etc., may be received to any amount ‚Äì such donations can not be set aside by any persons claiming under the donors, nor can they be impaired by anyone.\\" The Quakers, on the basis of this interpretation, appointed a number of trustees to accept donations of slaves from owners seeking to free their slaves. The Results of Quaker Trusteeship Over the next twenty years, the Quakers successfully used trusts to hold and free a number of slaves. By 1814 they held nearly 350 slaves in trust. A decade later the numbers held increased to over 500 slaves. At the apex of this program, in 1826, the Quakers held 600 slaves in trust. Individual Quakers from all over North Carolina gave their slaves to the Quaker established trusts. Some members went further, purchasing slaves from non-Quakers for the Society to hold in trust. Even some non-Quakers sought to assign their slaves to the Quaker trusts. The latter practice so worried the Quaker leadership that they prohibited it at the 1822 Yearly Meeting. Trustees fulfilled their obligations by granting entrusted slaves virtual freedom or transporting them to a state where freedom was available. Slaves held in trust in North Carolina often earned their own wages, ran their own families and owned their own property. Quakers also opened schools for these quasi-freedmen as early as 1816. Trustees sent other slaves to governments where the slave could be freed without violating the law. Popular destinations for entrusted slaves were Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. Board of Trustees v. Dickinson Quakers use of trusts proceeded unimpeded until 1829 when the issue came before the North Carolina Supreme Court. At issue in Trustees of the Quaker Society of Contentnea v. William Dickinson was an 1817 entrustment of a slave owned by William Dickinson to the Quakers of Contentnea. The terms of the conveyance required the Quakers to hold the slave in North Carolina until he could be freed in accordance with the laws of the State. While held, the slave was permitted to earn an income.Bassett, John S., Slavery in the State of North Carolina, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, (1899), p. 65-68 The majority opinion, written by Judge Taylor denied the ability of the Quakers to hold slaves in trust. Taylor narrowly interpreted the 1796 law allowing religious organizations to hold property in trust. The law, he concluded, only allowed a religious organization to hold property for its own benefit, not for the benefit or \\"other persons.\\" The Quakers, Taylor noted, harbored a religious and moral aversion to slavery, and sought slaves only to rid humanity of the sin of slave ownership. He further noted that the slaves held in trust were slaves in name only, and were given extensive freedoms. These facts lead him to conclude that the trust was, in reality, for the benefit of the slaves. He, therefore, rejected the ability of Quakers to hold slaves in trust for the purpose of freeing them in state.Morris, Thomas, Southern Slavery and the Law 1619-1860, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill and London, (1996) p. 400-404 The majority opinion also made note of the consequences of these trusts, if the Court found them valid. While freely admitting the right of individuals to hold slaves and do with them as they wished, the Court rejected the Quakers' actions as \\"fraudulent\\". The Court warned that \\"mischief\\" would ensue if those actions were upheld. According to Judge Taylor, the quasi-emancipated individuals working for their own benefit in sight of the enslaved \\"would naturally excite in the latter discontent with their condition, encourage idleness and disobedience, and lead possibly in the course of human events to the most calamitous of all contests, a bellum servile (slave revolt).\\" As a result, he concluded, the \\"duty of self-preservation\\" required the court overturn the law. In dissent, Judge Hall found that statute and its application clear. All that was required of any person or incorporated society claiming use of some property was a title proclaiming their rights in that property. He argued that nothing in the 1796 law or in Quaker doctrine prohibited the possession of slaves. He countered the majority's self- preservation argument by noting that that consideration was for the legislature to decide. Declining Use The decision prohibited Quaker trusts from holding slaves in North Carolina under conditions of virtual freedom. Subsequent decisions in the North Carolina Supreme Court reinforced this decision. The court did not, however, prohibit the use of trusts for the express purpose of sending slaves to be emancipated in other states; rather its major concern was with the conditions of virtual freedom given to slaves held in trust in the state. As a result, those Quakers still committed to the emancipation of slaves increasingly sent their entrusted slaves to northern states or states with lenient laws against manumission. Nevertheless, the practice of Quaker trusteeships fell into disuse by the 1830s. This decline occurred for a number of reasons. First, significant portions of the Quaker population migrated from North Carolina west to states like Ohio, thereby diminishing the political clout and anti-slavery passions of the community. Second, the prevailing attitude towards slavery in the South generally and North Carolina specifically changed drastically in the half century preceding the Civil War. As a result, there was increased political support for enforcing the restrictive policies against manumission. While some individual North Carolinians and Quakers continued to use trusts as means of freeing their slaves, the organized community has largely abandoned such efforts in the 1830s.

These methods are used primarily for crop growing, but some methods can be applied to homes as well.  Methods   Barriers  Dog control van, Rekong Peo, Himachal Pradesh, India Row covers are useful for keeping insects out of one's plants, typically used for horticultural crops. They are made out of either plastic or polyester. They are made thin and light to allow plants to still absorb sunshine and water from the air.Mahr, D. L., and N. M. Ridgway.\\"The General Approaches To Insect Control: An Overview\\", Entomology, 1993. Web. 20 Jan. 2011 Diatomaceous earth, made from fossilized and pulverized silica shells, can be used in order to damage the protective cuticle layer of insects that have them, such as ants. When this layer is damaged, the insects become vulnerable to drying out. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of Diatomaceous earth decreases if it is wet. Therefore, it must be used often.Green Methods,\\"Products to Physically Control Pests\\".Green Methods. nd. Web. 20 Jan 2011 This method was used back in the 1930s and 1940s when farmers would run dust over their fields. This would have the very same effect as diatomaceous earth.Meyer, John R. \\"Chapter 19: Pest Control Tactics\\" NC State University. 4 Nov. 2003. Web. 20 Jan. 2010  Fire  For farmers, fire has been a powerful technique used to destroy insect breeding grounds. It is used to burn the top of the soil in order to kill the insects that lie there. Unfortunately, this can present some drawbacks. Fire can make the soil much less effective or get rid of the insects that are beneficial to the plants. Also, there is no guarantee that it will actually solve the pest problems since there may be larvae below the surface of the soil.  Firearms  Historically, firearms have been one of the primary methods used for pest control. \\"Garden Guns\\" are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot or 9mm Flobert, and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden Guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past 15 to 20 yards, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure livestock with a ricochet. They are also used for pest control at airports, warehouses, stockyards, etc. The most common shot cartridge is .22 Long Rifle loaded with #12 shot. At a distance of about 10 feet (3 m), which is about the maximum effective range, the pattern is about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter from a standard rifle. Special smoothbore shotguns, such as the Marlin Model 25MG can produce effective patterns out to 15 or 20 yards using .22 WMR shotshells, which hold 1/8 oz. of #12 shot contained in a plastic capsule.  Animals  Dogs, cats, ferrets, mongoose and other animals have been historically used for pest control. The Rat Terrier is an American dog breed with a background as a farm dog and hunting companion.Kane, Alice J. Rat Terrier: a Comprehensive Owner's Guide. Kennel Club Books, 2003. Specifically bred for killing rats, today's Rat Terrier is an intelligent and active small dog that is kept both for pest control and as a family pet. Cats are also valued for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. Ferrets are used for hunting, or ferreting. With their long, lean build, and inquisitive nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. Mongooses have long been celebrated for their ability to handle venomous snakes, as immortalized in the short story Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.  Temperature Control  Placing produce inside of cold storage containers lengthens how long the produce lasts while also hindering the growth of insects inside of them. Another method to use is to heat, as it will kill the insect larvae in certain types of produce. An example would be with mangoes, where they are placed into a hot water bath in order to kill any eggs and larvae.  Traps  Fly paper or sticky boards are devices used in order to capture insects as they land upon the surface of the trap. They are covered in a substance that attracts insects, but are actually very sticky or poisonous. These traps are commonly used for flies or leafhoppers. Trap strips are crops that are grown on fields with the intention of using them to attract insects and not have insects infest the other crops that are being grown. The insects can then be dealt with much more easily than if they were to have been spread throughout an entire field. Trap strips are very useful for dealing with the wheat stem sawfly. The sawflies will go only as far as they need to in order to plant their eggs. If solid stemmed plants are planted around the a crop field, then that's where the sawflies will go and the sawflies‚Äô larvae can't survive in the solid stem.  Large Scale Usage  On a much larger scale, physical control methods become much less effective because of the time that must be invested into it and because it is likely to be less economical. For example, taking care of a single tree is simple, but taking care of 500, like on a farm, would be impossible using physical control.

Additionally, there must be some element of secrecy. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be the subject-matter of a trade secret.  Purpose  Trade secrets are a type of intellectual property that consists of certain information, expertise or knowhow that has been developed or acquired by firms. This knowledge frequently gives firms their competitive edge in the market and it has to be kept as a secret. In Canada any information that a firm or its employees produces or acquires for the purpose of the firm's business can constitute confidential information that courts are willing to protect. All that is required is that the creator of the information ‚Äúhas used his brain and thus produced a result which can be produced by somebody who goes through the same process‚Äù.Salman Engineering Co. Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Co. Ltd. (1948), [1963] 3 All E.R. 413 at 415 (C.A.). According to Seager v. Copydex Ltd,Seager Limited v Copydex Limited, [1967] 2 All ER 415 courts will even act to protect a comparatively underdeveloped idea from misappropriation. However, information may stop being confidential and confident may be released from its obligations of confidence if the information subject to confidence is later publicly disclosed by the confider or a third party.  Trade Secrets vs. Confidential Information  With one exception in the field of employer- employee relations, there is no recognized distinction in Canada between the rights and remedies afforded to trade secrets as opposed to mere confidential information. In the field of employer-employee relationships, the British case Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler, which has been cited with approval by several Canadian courts, has drawn a distinction between the two. Allocation of powers under the Constitution Under the Constitution Act 1867, the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to most areas of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights;Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(2), 91(22) and 91(23). whereas the provincial government has exclusive authority to legislate on matters related to property and civil rights. The federal Parliament also has exclusive jurisdiction to create offences under its criminal law power.Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(29). At one time, the federal Trade-marks Act prohibited anyone from \\"do[ing] any other act or adopt[ing] any other business practice contrary to honest industrial or commercial usage in Canada,\\" (now repealed) which was considered to include the taking of trade secrets. However, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd. that the provisions encroached on the provinces' authority over property and civil rights and could not be upheld under the federal trade and commerce power. Therefore, the regulation of trade secrets as a civil matter falls under provincial jurisdiction. Civil legal framework  Uniform Trade Secrets Act  The Uniform Trade Secrets Act, adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in 1989, would provide civil remedies for the breach of trade secrets. That Uniform Act defines \\"trade secrets\\" as follows: To date, the Uniform Act has not been enacted into law by any of the Legislatures, but the definition has been incorporated in the federal Security of Information Act.  Civil Remedial Relief - Common Law Provinces In all the provinces but Quebec, trade secrets are governed by the common law, ultimately derived from the English common law as interpreted and applied in Canada. The Canadian definition of trade secret is based on Canadian case law and doctrine, and also draws on American and English case law. In Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd., the Supreme Court of Canada held that a breach of confidence action is sui generis and the courts may rely on all three traditional jurisdictional bases for action (contract, equity and property) to enforce the policy of the law that confidences are to be respected. In common law, there are essentially five types of civil action that a trade secret holder can rely on to seek protection of its trade secrets before a court of justice: #breach of contract (expressed or implied provision), #breach of confidence, #breach of fiduciary duty, #unjust enrichment and #wrongful interference with the contractual relations of others. The Supreme Court of Canada stated in Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd. that all these types of actions coexist in the Canadian judicial system and remain available to the trade secret holder.Cadbury Schweppes, at pp. 4048.  Civil Remedial Relief - Quebec  In Quebec, trade secrets are governed by provisions under the Civil Code of Quebec. An action for breach of trade secrets or confidential business information generally arises either from a contractual liability action or, in the absence of a contract, from a civil liability action. The Code deals specifically with trade secrets in one article that provides for a defense where disclosing the secret is in the public interest, and in one that describes how a loss resulting from disclosure is to be calculated. However, none of its provisions define the concept of trade secret. The Quebec Court of Appeal has ruled in Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company that those who own trade secrets (secrets de commerce) are entitled to seek protection and that Quebec courts are competent to grant remedies in the case the plaintiff can evidence its ownership of them.Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company (1967) B.R. 814 at p.819.  Contractual Sanctions  Two important forms of contract used by employers in Canada to protect their trade secrets and confidential information are non-disclosure agreements and non- competition agreements, which are also known as confidentiality agreements and restrictive covenants. According to Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler, ex- employees, post-termination, may use their general skills and knowledge anywhere but they may not use or divulge their former employer's trade secrets. Exceptionally, ex-employers may also be able to enjoin a former employee's use of non-trade secret information where that information has been obtained from records which qualify as trade secrets.Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Flower, [1986] 1 All E.R. 617 (CA). According to International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar, in Canada the length of a permanent injunction to force a defendant to cease using the plaintiff's information should not normally extend beyond the time that the plaintiff's trade secrets remains a secret which is exclusively known to the plaintiff and its confidants. In Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd. Justice Binnie concluded that the form of relief for breach of confidence was ‚Äúdictated by the facts of the case rather than strict jurisdictional or doctrinal considerations‚Äù. He also stated that ‚Äúwhether a breach of contract in a particular case has a contractual, tortuous, proprietary or trust flavour goes to the appropriateness of particular equitable remedy but does not limit the court‚Äôs jurisdiction to grant it‚Äù.  Criminal Sanctions  In R. v. Stewart, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the taking of confidential information cannot form the basis of a charge of theftCriminal Code, RSC 1970, c C‚Äë34, s 283 (now found at Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 322). under the Criminal Code, but it could in certain circumstances form one for fraud:Criminal Code, RSC 1970, c C-34, s 338; now found at Criminal Code, RSC 1984, c C-46, s 380. :* while theft encompasses the taking or conversion of \\"anything whether animate or inanimate,\\" the Court held that \\"anything\\" must still be property of some sort, capable of being \\"taken or converted in a way that deprives the owner of his proprietary interest in some way.\\" Confidential information, by its very nature, \\"cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save very exceptional far‚Äëfetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived of it.\\"R. v. Stewart, par. 41 :* on the other hand, the concept of \\"defraud\\" is established under current jurisprudence by proving a dishonest deprivation \\"of any property, money or valuable security or any service.\\" This is satisfied upon proof of a risk of prejudice to the victim's economic interests; actual economic loss is not essential. Accordingly, deprivation of confidential information falls within the definition of fraud where it is in the nature of a trade secret or copyrighted material that has commercial value.R. v. Stewart, par. 4548 Parliament has since amended the Security of Information Act to provide that it is an offence to: :* communicate a trade secret to another person, group or organization; or :* obtain, retain, alter or destroy a trade secret, for the benefit of a foreign economic entity, and to the detriment of Canada's economic interests, international relations or national defence or national security.

In the UK it is found only at Blue John Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern at Castleton in Derbyshire. During the 19th century, it was mined for its ornamental value, and mining continues on a small scale. Deposits of fluorite have been recently found in China with colouring and banding similar to the classic Blue John stone. Etymology The most common explanation for the name is that it derives from the French , meaning 'blue-yellow'. The story goes that Blue John was exported to France where it was used by ormolu workers during the reign of Louis XVI (1774‚Äì91). However, there is no archival record of any Blue John being exported to France, and the early ormolu ornaments which use Blue John were being manufactured by Matthew Boulton of Birmingham in the 1760s. An alternative origin of the name derives from an old miners' name for the zinc ore sphalerite which they called \\"Black Jack\\". Thus the unique blue stone mined in these caverns could easily have become known as \\"Blue John\\". Another derivation comes from the Cornish miners who began working the Derbyshire lead mines in the 1740s. The name Blue John is used for several rocks in Cornwall, including fluorspars, and derives from the Cornish language word , in Old Cornish , a flower, bloom or blossom. Geology Vein of Blue John Fluorite in Treak Cliff Cavern Blue John seams in Blue John Cavern In the United Kingdom, the blue, banded, fluorite known as Blue John is found only under the triangular hill known as Treak Cliff, just outside the town of Castleton. Today the veins are mined only in Blue John Cavern and the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern, although the abandoned Old Tor Mine on the north side of Winnats Pass was also, at one time, a source for the mineral. Mineralogy The mineral veins of the Peak District were formed during the late Carboniferous and Early Permian times, when the limestones were at a depth of . The minerals were deposited in veins by layers of crystals precipitating from hot fluids coating the walls of fractures, caves, and other cavities. Petrological analysis has shown that the Blue John, like fluorite elsewhere in the Peak District, crystallised from a highly saline fluid at temperatures of 90‚Äì120 ¬∞C or perhaps a little higher. Despite much investigation, the origin of the blue colour of Blue John remains uncertain. Microscopic analysis has failed to find any impurities such as potassium permanganate or hydrocarbons which could produce a purple-blue colour. It is now thought that the colour may be a physical phenomenon due to crystal lattice dislocation. If the regular arrangement of atoms in the fluorite molecules are disturbed or dislocated, then this may yield the blue colour in Blue John. The cause of these dislocations is unknown, but one possibility is that it is due to colloidal calcium, i.e. excess of calcium atoms needed to form fluorite. Blue John can be decolourised by heating it in an oven for a few hours, a phenomenon apparently caused by the heat realigning the lattice dislocations removing the colour. Irradiating the discoloured Blue John in a nuclear reactor can bring the colour back. Similar rocks elsewhere Blue, unbanded fluorite occurs in many localities around the world. Within the UK, blue fluorspars are also found in County Durham, especially Weardale. Elsewhere, blue fluorspar is known in the Ardennes region of Belgium; the Cave-in-Rock area of Illinois in the United States; and at various localities in Mexico and China. Blue-banded fluorite is very rare. An ornamental mineral known to the Romans as murrhine may have been a fluorspar similar to Blue John. Recently discovered deposits in China have produced fluorite with colouring and banding similar to the classic Blue John stone. One source is the Deqing Fluorite Mine, in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, the only source (other than in Derbyshire) that has an ornamental craft based upon it. However, although this fluorite is similar to Blue John its banding is straighter and it contains colours not associated with Blue John, suggesting they are compounds and not inclusions as in Blue John. =Roman murrhine= Roman writers, such as Pliny the Elder, refer to a soft ornamental rock which they called murrhine, out of which drinking vessels were carved. Pliny describes the mineral as having a \\"great variety of colours\\" with \\"shades of purple and white with a mixture of the two\\". Whether this mineral was banded fluorite is uncertain, but it was apparently soft enough (like fluorite) to allow one particular man of consular rank to gnaw at the edges of his cup. There is no reason to suppose the mineral came from Britain - Pliny and other writers specifically state that the mineral came from Persia. It is sometimes claimed that Blue John vases were found during excavations at Pompeii, but these vases are in fact made from banded amethystine quartz. However, two cups have been found among Roman grave-goods near the Turkish/Syrian border, on the former Persian-Roman trade route, which were made from blue-yellow banded fluorspar presumably obtained from the Persian source mentioned by Pliny. Both cups, known as the Crawford Cup and the Barber Cup, are in the British Museum.The Crawford Cup, British Museum, retrieved 26 October 2012The Barber Cup, British Museum, retrieved 26 October 2012 Discovery Blue John goblets on display at Chatsworth House It is sometimes said that Blue John of Derbyshire was discovered by the Romans. However the earliest source of this story is William Adam's 1843 book Gem of the Peak. It seems likely that Adam was attempting to add some mystique to the Derbyshire Blue John. Although the Romans did mine lead in Derbyshire, there is no evidence that they encountered the Blue John veins. The earliest reference to the mineral \\"Blue John\\" occurs in a letter dated 1766 noting a lease from Lady Mazarine, which states that she \\"let ye Blue John, Castleton\\". The next reference occurs in a 1768 letter by the industrialist Matthew Boulton who attempted to purchase or lease the mines so that he could mine the Blue John to create decorative vases (ormolu). It is clear that by this date the mining of Blue John had been going on for several years. The earliest dated decorative applications of Blue John in Britain are those in use as fireplace panels. The bridal suite of the Friary Hotel in Derby has a Blue John plaque dated to around 1760. About the same time, fireplaces with Blue John panels were designed by neoclassical architect and interior designer Robert Adam, and installed at Kedleston Hall near Derby. Later output French candelabra crafted of Blue John. Circa 1860 By the 19th century Blue John was being fashioned into a wide variety of ornamental items ranging from knife-handles to chalices. The precise quantities mined in any given year are unknown, but 18th-century leases restricted output to 20 tons per annum. By 1892, the output is said to have been limited to 3 tons per annum. Today, production is probably around half a ton per annum, and the raw Blue John produced is kept within Castleton where small articles, mainly jewellery, are worked and sold. A \\"lost\\" deposit was rediscovered in Treak Cliff Cavern in 2013, and in 2015 a new vein, the first for 150 years, was discovered close to the tourist route in the same cavern. Elsewhere, similar blue and white-yellow banded fluorite ornaments are now imported into the UK and other countries from China.  Production  Before they can be worked, the stones (having been air-dried for at least a year) are heated in an oven, then placed in a bowl of hot epoxy resin (previously, pine resin was used), and then further heated in a vacuum oven. This drives out air from minute pores in the stone, and replaces it with the resin, which binds the otherwise friable crystal structure, allowing it to be cut and polished. After resining, the stones are cut on a circular saw. They may be made into rough cuboids or cylinders (\\"rough-outs\\"), for turning as bowls and vases, or flat slices, for making jewellery. Rough-outs are glued to a metal chuck and turned on a lathe, sometimes using pieces of broken grinding wheels. The chuck is removed by heating the glue, or ‚Äî if the operator is inclined ‚Äî a sharp tap on the chuck with a spanner. A further resining stage may take place, before the piece is returned to the lathe and polished with wet abrasive paper. A final high polish is added using putty powder (finely crushed tin dioxide) applied with a moist piece of felt.

It is endemic to the south-central and southeastern United States as far west as Oklahoma and Texas and as far north as New York. This species is divided into two subspecies. The subspecies tecta is sometimes treated as a species in its own right, Arundinaria tecta, and is the taxon generally called switch cane.

Description This bamboo, which is a species of cane, is a perennial grass with a rounded, hollow stem which can exceed in diameter and grow to a height of . It grows from a large network of thick rhizomes. The lance-shaped leaves are up to long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme or panicle of spikelets measuring in length. An individual cane has a lifespan of about 10 years. Most reproduction is vegetative as the bamboo sprouts new stems from its rhizome. It rarely produces seeds and it flowers irregularly.

Habitat and ecology This native plant is a member of several plant communities today, generally occurring as a component of the understory or midstory. It grows in pine forests dominated by loblolly, slash, longleaf, and shortleaf pine, and stands of oaks, cypress, ash, and cottonwood. Other plants in the understory include inkberry (Ilex glabra), creeping blueberry (Vaccinium crassifolium), wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), blue huckleberry (Gaylussacia frondosa), pineland threeawn (Aristida stricta), cutover muhly (Muhlenbergia expansa), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and toothache grass (Ctenium aromaticum). Cane communities occur on floodplains, bogs, riparian woods, pine barrens and savannas, and pocosins. It grows easily in flooded and saturated soils. It tolerates wildfire, and canebrakes are maintained by a normal fire regime. This cane is the food plant for the southern pearly eye, a butterfly. Canebrakes are an important habitat for the Swainson's, hooded, and Kentucky warblers, as well as the white-eyed vireo. The disappearance of the canebrake ecosystem may have contributed to the rarity and possible extinction of the Bachman's warbler, which was dependent upon it for nesting sites.Bachman's Warbler. BirdLife International Species Profile. Retrieved 12-13-2011. Conservation Canebrakes declined after European settlement of the American southeast. Factors involved in the decline include the introduction of livestock such as cattle, which eagerly graze on the leaves. The cane was considered a good forage for the animals until overgrazing began to eliminate canebrake habitat.

He was awarded the 1998 Edwin F. Ullman Award.http://www.aacc.org/about/awards/hall_of_fame/Pages/RogerEkins1998UA.aspx Life He earned a PhD from Cambridge University. He revolutionized endocrinology by enabling the measurement of tiny quantities of analytes at levels so low as to be beyond chemical analysis, thus transforming endocrinology from a clinical descriptive speciality to a quantitative science. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and later received the Queen's Medal. His laboratory He was initially a researcher at the Barnato Joel Laboratory, at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School, where he later headed the Department of Molecular Endocrinology. He was the inventor of Saturation Analysis and Radioimmunoassay, creating assays for Thyroxine, Triiodothyronne, free thyroxine, and free triiodothyronine. He established the mathematical models for competitive limited reagent immunoassays as contrasted to excess reagents typified by i8mmunoradiometric assays. His prediction of higher sensitivity for the latter was confirmed by the creation by Daya Kishore Hazra working in Ekins laboratory in 1975 of the ultrasensitive TSH assay which revolutionized the management of thyroid diseases by allowing for diagnosis of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism by measuring TSH, as it could differentiate low levels of hyperthyroidism from normal levels, as contrasted to the hitherto used radioimmunoassay which was less sensitive and could not differentiate low from normal levels. The thyroidal assays of thyroxine/triiodothyronine/free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine and immunometric assays for thyroid-stimulating hormone constitute today the most widely used hormonal assays in the world. He later developed multianalyte spot assays using multiple antibodies and a Confocal microscope reading laser signals emitted by the antibody spots corresponding to different analytes. This was the prototype of array technology assays widely used in both proteomics as well as genomics. He worked on endemic goiter and mental retardation in New Guinea. Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for their radioimmunoassay of Insulin, using methods similar to those used earlier by Roger Ekins for measuring the thyroid hormones!

The cartoon stars an ensemble cast of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck, and Goofy while vacationing in Hawaii (then an organized incorporated territory of the United States). The film was directed by Ben Sharpsteen, produced by John Sutherland and features the voices of Walt Disney as Mickey, Marcellite Garner as Minnie, Clarence Nash as Donald, and Pinto Colvig as Goofy and Pluto. It was Disney's first film to be released by RKO, ending a five-year distributing partnership with United Artists.Hawaiian Holiday at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts It was the 96th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the seventh for the year. Plot Mickey and his friends are vacationing in Hawaii. Minnie dances in a grass skirt while Mickey plays a slide guitar, Donald plays a ukulele, and Pluto chases the waves. Meanwhile, Goofy decides to go surfing, but when he rushes toward the wave it seems to have a mind of its own, running backwards as soon as Goofy starts running toward it, causing Goofy to hit his head on a rock. The wave then comes back in and washes Goofy around, eventually leaving his head stuck in the sand. Mickey begins to have a problem with his guitar, while Minnie and Donald trade places. However, when Donald takes his turn with the skirt, he dances too close to the fire and accidentally sets the skirt on fire. He rapidly goes to a pool to put the blaze out, but in the process, he pulls up a starfish. Donald throws the starfish off his bottom and it lands right in front of Pluto. After Pluto sniffs at it, it begins to rapidly run away. Pluto chases it right up to the waves where he gets buried in the sand. The starfish hops right over him, hits him on the nose, and escapes while Pluto looks on in frustration. Goofy tries his luck with the waves again and is actually able to get a swell, but it breaks beneath him and washes his board away. As Goofy searches underwater for his board, another wave comes it and drives his board into his pants, leaving him struggling to get it out. Meanwhile, Pluto is sniffing at a seashell. A wave comes in and knocks him off his feet, which also leaves the shell stuck to his nose. Pluto tries to shake the shell off, but it gets stuck on his bottom instead. He tries and tries to get it off, but can't seem to. It is later revealed that there is a crab living in the shell, which clamps onto Pluto's tail. Although he can feel something on his tail, Pluto does not fully notice the crab until it pinches him, which makes him yelp in pain. The crab begins walking in a certain pattern which Pluto follows until they reach the surf, where a wave comes in and buries Pluto. As with the starfish, the crab tortures him by hitting him on the nose before departing. Meanwhile, Goofy tries one last time to catch a wave successfully, but the wave throws him off his board, hits him with it, and catapults him into the sand where he is stopped by his board, making it look as if it is his grave. Mickey, Minnie, and Donald laugh at him, and when he pops out unharmed, they continue enjoying their vacation.

The film's title references a play by William Shakespeare. Plot A rat is sitting on a rock at a park, wondering how he should spend his day. He then sees a charming girl hippo in his surrounding, and therefore develops affection for her despite the size difference. Although a boy elephant was first to come and court her, the rat finds this a minor problem and thinks of a way to break them. Just then, Krazy Kat comes to the area. Krazy begins playing a song in his banjo, hoping to win the rat's friendship. The rat, however, appears to be uninterested, and grabs Krazy's instrument before knocking down the cat with it. The rat then approaches the girl hippo and tries to serenade her with the banjo. Because the boy elephant has a phobia of rodents, the rat easily drives out the pachyderm who runs away in panic. After fleeing the park, the boy elephant finds himself just outside a tavern. He then notices a barrel of bevo right next to him. The elephant then drinks the contents of the barrel and somehow gets the courage to get back at the rat. Back at the park, the rat and the girl hippo are still around dating each other. In no time, the encouraged boy elephant returns to settle the score. After jumping on and smashing the rat to death, the boy elephant regains the girl hippo. Before the two hefty lovers happily walked away, the boy elephant covers the rat's corpse in dirt and lays a flower pot just beside. Krazy shows up again to see what become of his would-be-friend. Saddened by this, he plays a solemn tune in his banjo, and his tears shower upon the flower pot. Seconds later, a flower grows from the pot and the rat's ghost appears on it. Annoyed by Krazy's gesture, the ghostly rat strikes the feline off his feet with a cinderblock before ascending to the great beyond.

The plans are threefold, embracing (1) Open warfare directed from Hitler's mountain headquarters; (2) Sabotage and guerrilla activity conducted by partisan bands organized by districts, and (3) Propaganda warfare to be carried on by some 200,000 Nazi followers in Europe and elsewhere. Strongholds Established Already picked S.S. (elite) troops have been established in underground strongholds and hospitals in the Austrian, Bavarian and Italian Alpine area and it is the plan of Nazi leaders to flee to that region when the German military collapse comes\\" . for Germany's government and armed forces to retreat to an area from \\"southern Bavaria across western Austria to northern Italy\\".\\"But what of the top Nazis who cannot hide? With a compact army of young SS and Hitler Youth fanatics, they will retreat, behind a loyal rearguard cover of Volksgrenadiere and Volksst√ºrmer, to the Alpine massif which reaches from southern Bavaria across western Austria to northern Italy. There immense stores of food and munitions are being laid down in prepared fortifications. If the retreat is a success, such an army might hold out for years\\" () The plan was never fully endorsed by Hitler and no serious attempt was made to put the plan into operation, although it served as an effective tool of propaganda and military deception by the Germans in the final stages of the war. History The final operations of the Western Allied armies in Germany between 19 April and 7 May 1945 In the six months following the D-Day landings in Normandy in June 1944, the American and British armies advanced to the Rhine and seemed poised to strike into the heart of Germany, while the Red Army, advancing from the east through Poland, reached the Oder. It seemed likely that Berlin would soon fall and Germany be divided. In these circumstances, it occurred both to some leading figures in the German regime and to the Allies that the logical thing for the Germans to do would be to move the government to the mountainous areas of southern Germany and Austria, where a relatively small number of determined troops could hold out for some time. A number of intelligence reports to the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) identified the area as having stores of foodstuffs and military supplies built up over the preceding six months, and could even be harbouring armaments production facilities. Within this fortified terrain, they said, Hitler would be able to evade the Allies and cause tremendous difficulties for the occupying Allied forces throughout Germany. The minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, set up a special unit to invent and spread rumours about an Alpenfestung. Goebbels also sent out rumours to neutral governments, thus keeping the Redoubt myth alive and its state of readiness unclear. He enlisted the assistance of the intelligence service SD to produce faked blueprints and reports on construction supplies, armament production and troop transfers to the Redoubt. This utter deception of Allied military intelligence is considered to be one of the greatest feats of the German Abwehr during the entire war. Although Adolf Hitler never fully endorsed the plan, he did provisionally agree to it at a conference with Franz Hofer in January 1945.https://www.allworldwars.com/Ultra-and-The-Myth-of-the- National-Redoubt-by-Marvin-Meek.html. Retrieved 18 November 2019. Hitler also issued an order on 24 April 1945 for the evacuation of remaining government personnel from Berlin to the Redoubt. He made it clear that he would not leave Berlin himself, even if it fell to the Soviets, as it did on 2 May 1945. Nevertheless, the National Redoubt had serious military and political consequences. Once the Anglo-American armies had crossed the Rhine and advanced into Western Germany, a decision had to be made whether to advance on a narrow front towards Berlin or in a simultaneous push by all Western armies spanning from the North Sea to the Alps. America's most aggressive commander, Third Army head General George S. Patton in General Omar Bradley's centrally located Twelfth Army Group, had advocated a narrow front ever since D-Day, and did so again; likewise at this point British 21st Army Group chief Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in the north, each lobbying to be the decisive spearhead. Cautious Allied commander in chief U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower, however, resisted both. Ultimately, this broad front strategy left the Seventh Army of General Jacob L. Devers' southern Sixth Army Group in a position at war's end to race south through Bavaria into Austria to prevent German entrenchment in any mountain redoubt and cut off alpine passes to Nazi escape. When the American armies penetrated Bavaria and western Austria at the end of April, they met little organized resistance, and the National Redoubt was shown to have been a myth. The alleged Alpine Fortress was one of three reasons associated with SHAEF's movement of forces towards southern Germany rather than towards Berlin, the other two being the fact that the city was planned to be in the Soviet Zone of Occupation, and that the battle for it would have entailed unacceptably high Western Allied casualties. Evacuations to the Alpine Fortress *In February/early March 1945, SHAEF received reports that German military, government and Nazi Party offices and their staffs were leaving Berlin for the area around Berchtesgaden, the site of Hitler's retreat in the Bavarian Alps. *In February 1945, the SS evacuated V-2 rocket scientists from the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center to the Alpine Fortress. *SS Generalleutnant Gottlob Berger claimed Hitler had signed a 22 April 1945 order to evacuate 35,000 prisoners to the Alpine Fortress as hostages, but Berger did not carry out the order (many evacuated locations also failed to obey Hitler's order requiring Demolitions on Reich Territory, e.g., Mittelwerk). Post-war claims Post-war claims regarding the Alpine Fortress include: *The Alpine Fortress \\"grew into so exaggerated a scheme that I am astonished we could have believed it as innocently as we did. But while it persisted, this legend of the Redoubt was too ominous a threat to be ignored.\\" (General Omar Bradley) *Allied assessments of the Alpine Fortress were \\"the worst intelligence reports of all time, but no one knew that in March of 1945, and few even suspected it.\\" (author Stephen E.
