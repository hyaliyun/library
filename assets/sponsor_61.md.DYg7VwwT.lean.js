It was the second highest office in the political hierarchy of Mughal Bengal, including as a nominal position during the British East India Company's occupation of Bengal. The Naib Nazim was the deputy of the Nawab of Bengal, who was based in Murshidabad. The Naib Nazim was responsible for governing territories in eastern Bengal, including for revenue collection, army and navy affairs; and administering justice. In the later period of British rule, the Naib Nazims were heavily influenced by English culture, spoke fluent English and collected Western art. The 19th century office holder Nusrat Jung was described as an anglophile. Dhaka's status as a leading financial and commercial center of Mughal India lent significant influence to the office of the Naib Nazim. The Naib Nazims initially resided in Islam Khan's Fort and the Bara Katra. The Nimtali Kuthi was their last official residence. The government and era of the Naib Nazims is known as the niabat. Prior to the niabat, Dhaka was the viceregal capital of Subedar of Bengal. The Naib Nazims can be compared with the position of Lieutenant Governor in rank and equivalence. The abolishing of the Naib Nazim's office coincided with Dhaka's decline as the leading city of Bengal. The next time Dhaka's political prominence was revived was during the short lived British province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. History The surviving gateway of Nimtali Kuthi, the last residence of the Naib Nazims of Dhaka The office was created between 1716 and 1717, when prime minister Murshid Quli Khan transferred the capital of Bengal from Dhaka to Murshidabad. Emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Khan as the Subedar of Bengal. As the authority of the Mughal imperial court declined, Khan replaced the position of Subedar with a hereditary Nawab. In the former capital Dhaka, he anointed a deputy to administer eastern Bengal. The earliest prominent Naib Nazims of Dhaka included Khan Muhammad Ali Khan (1717), Itisam Khan (1723-1726) and Mirza Lutfullah (1728-1733). During the tenure of Sarfaraz Khan, Dhaka saw rapid economic growth. Nawazish Muhammad Khan ruled through his wife Ghaseti Begum and his deputy Husain Quli Khan. Jasarat Khan, appointed by Alivardi Khan, was the Naib Nazim during the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the year which heralded great political change in Bengal. After a brief suspension, Jasarat Khan continued to hold the office until 1778, with support from the British East India Company. Muhammad Reza Khan interrupted Jasarat Khan's tenure in 1763, 1775 and 1779. After the death of Jasarat Khan, his three grandsons Hashmat Jung (1779‚Äì1785), Nusrat Jung (1785‚Äì1822) and Shamsuddaula (1822‚Äì1831) held the office. From 1793, the family was pensioned off with the royal title of Naib Nazim of Dhaka. The nominal office was formally abolished in 1843. Ghaziuddin Haidar was the last Naib Nazim. Here is a list of Naib-Nazims of Dhaka: * Khan Muhammad Ali Khan (1717) * Itisam Khan (1723‚Äì1726) * A son of Itisam Khan (1726‚Äì1727) * Mirza Lutfullah Tabrizi (a grandson-in-law of Murshid Quli Khan) (1728‚Äì1734) * Sarfaraz Khan (1734‚Äì1739) ** Galib Ali Khan (1734‚Äì1738) ** Murad Ali Khan (1738‚Äì1739) * Abdul Fattah Khan (1739‚Äì1740) * Nawazish Muhammad Khan (1740‚Äì1754) (son in law of Alivardi Khan) ** Hossain Quli Khan (1740‚Äì1754) ** Murad Dowlat (1754‚Äì1755) * Jasarat Khan (1755‚Äì1762 and 1765‚Äì1778) ** Mohammed Ali (1762‚Äì1762) ** Mohammed Reza Khan (1763‚Äì1765) * Hashmat Jung Syed Muhammad (the eldest grandson of Jasarat Khan) (1779‚Äì1785) * Nusrat Jung (the second grandson of Jasarat Khan) (1785‚Äì1822) * Shamsuddaula (the third grandson of Jasarat Khan) (1822‚Äì1831) * Jalaluddin Muhammad Qamaruddaulah (a son of Shamsuddaula) (1831‚Äì1834) * Ghaziuddin Haider (a son of Qamaruddaulah) (1834‚Äì1843) The British-era Naib Nazims of Dhaka were influenced by the Western culture and way of life. They learnt the English language and patronised Western art. According to Charles D'Oyly, Nusrat Jung's audience chamber was filled with English prints and paintings. Nusrat Jung was well versed in history and current affairs and could speak English fluently. Nusrat Jung was the longest serving Naib Nazim. Dhaka's trade and commerce grew during the niabat. Exports by European companies from Dhaka quadrupled. The Naib Nazims relied on Dhaka's wealthy Armenian community and Marwari bankers. The Muslim-ruled city was home to a Hindu merchant class. The city hosted factories of the Dutch, French, English and Portuguese. Powers The annual revenue of the Naib Nazim was 1 million imperial rupees, which was a very high amount during the era. His duties were to administer justice, supervise trade professions, identify and punish seditious persons, collect and deposit revenue punctually at the treasury and maintain military bases, forts and the navy. For administration expenses, the revenues of Dhaka, Mymensingh, Sylhet and other districts were assigned to him. The Naib Nazim owned riverside properties for the upkeep of naval boats and personnel. The properties were, however, confiscated by the British gradually. The Naib Nazim of Dhaka had revenue and administrative powers until 1790. As a result of Mughal defeat in the Battle of Buxar, the Naib Nazim's functions were greatly reduced. In 1790, Lord Cornwallis abolished the powers of the Naib Nazim. Dhaka formally passed to the control of the East India Company in 1793. Later Naib Nazims held the office nominally, as a symbol of the Mughal aristocracy under company rule in India. All Mughal positions were permanently abolished in India after the Mutiny of 1857, which led to the establishment of the British Indian Empire as a crown colony. Residence The Naib Nazims initially resided in Islam Khan's fort (now located in the premises of the Dhaka Central Jail). After the British took control of the fort, the Naib Nazims moved to the Bara Katra (Great Caravenserai Palace). In 1766, the Nimtali Kuthi became the official residence of the Naib Nazims. Today, only the gateway of the Nimtali Kuthi survives. Customs The Naib Nazims were associated with medieval glory and elegance. They wore the finest muslin and silk dresses, smoked hookahs, played polo, went on hunting trips and maintained harems. An annual grand Eid procession was brought out by the Naib Nazims.

It leads directly into the Walk Arcade at the northern end, and faces Centre Place across Collins Street at the southern end, forming part of a chain of arcades and lanes which lead from Flinders Street Station to Melbourne Central Shopping Centre through the blocks between Elizabeth and Swanston streets.  History  Starting in the late 1870s, this block of Collins Street was home to the city's most fashionable stores, such as milliners, glove-importers, portrait painters, photographers and hairdressers. Businesses such as George's Emporium, Allan's and Glen's music and Mullens' Bookshop and Lending Library drew the cream of Melbourne society. The act of promenading here became a social pastime, known as ‚Äòdoing the block‚Äô, and the street became known simply as \\"The Block\\", a title taken up by the Block Arcade, built 1890-93. Gunstler's Cafe (at about 280 Collins Street) was established in 1879 and was amongst the most fashionable restaurants in the city. In 1890 it was renamed the Vienna Caf√©, which in 1908 was purchased by Greek Australian restauranter Antony J. Lucas. During World War 1 the name of the cafe became controversial,and Lucas responded by expanding and completely rebuilding the interior in 1916, and it reopened as the Cafe Australia, the finest tea-room in the city. Designed by US trained architect Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, it was their first completed major work in their adopted country, and featured fountains, sculpture, planting, indirect lighting, and their distinctive intricate geometric detailing. In the late 1930s, the Cafe was demolished and replaced by the Hotel Australia, completed in mid 1939. Designed by Leslie M. Perrott, it was a 12-storey building with 94 rooms, numerous private dining and function rooms, and was the most prestigious hotel in Melbourne in its day. It included an arched-roofed ballroom which was a simplified version of the main Cafe Australia space. The hotel included two small cinemas, a restaurant and bar in the basement, and a through-block shopping arcade on the ground floor which was touted as the largest in Australia, known as the Australia Arcade. In 1989, the Hotel Australia was demolished to make way for a new development, completed in 1992, the Australia on Collins shopping arcade and four star hotel. The building's architecture, designed by Buchan Laid & Bawden (now the Buchan Group) was variously described as postmodern and imitating art deco style, and the shopping levels were ramped up and down from the street entrances in order to maximise the number of shops, and which resulted in a confusing layout. In later years, Australia on Collins was criticised as \\"a poor man's temple to the great god of commercialism\\" and included in a list of Melbourne's worst buildings by The Age newspaper. The shopping centre in this period included approximately 100 shops and a food court with space for 750 diners. In April 2014, then owners LaSalle Investment Management (LIM) announced that the \\"dysfunctional\\" centre would be closed for a redevelopment costing . Architects Ashton Raggat McDougall were engaged to improve the building's \\"sight lines\\" and to prevent customers from feeling \\"trapped\\", which resulted in the shopping levels being reduced from five levels to four, without the ramping. LIM stated that the redeveloped centre would be made up of larger stores with a focus on international brands. The redeveloped St. Collins Lane opened on 16 May 2016 and was immediately placed on the market by its owners, along with the Melbourne Novotel hotel. The centre had an approximately 70% tenancy rate at opening and was hoped by its owners to rival the recently opened Emporium Melbourne on Lonsdale Street. St. Collins Lane was purchased in November 2016 by JPMorgan Asset Management for a reported price of $247 million.  Tenants  The centre has 35 operating stores and includes clothing, footwear and cosmetics outlets, as well as a food court. Current key tenants include Leica, Maje, Coach, Furla, The Kooples, Zadig & Voltaire, Tag Heuer and Birkenstock. UK department store Debenhams opened as an anchor tenant in October 2017 but closed in January 2020. In November 2018, Melbourne‚Äôs first Leica store and gallery opened offering an art gallery, studio and Akademie workshops. In November 2018, it was announced that British watchmaker Bremont and Paris fashion house Claudie Pierlot had signed on as new tenants. Bremont is set to open in December 2018 while Claudie Pierlot will open for trading in the first half of 2019.

His research was covered in the Serbian media and published in book form in 1997. When American researchers published similar findings in 2005, some suggested the possibility of a direct influence.D.

From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one- third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists by the sponsoring parties. Joviƒá automatically received a mandate by virtue of his position on the list. See Guide to the Early Election, Ministry of Information of the Republic of Serbia, December 1992, made available by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, accessed 14 July 2017. The Socialist Party of Serbia and its allies won the election, the SPO served in opposition. Joviƒá served as president of the Kraljevo municipal assembly in this period. In 1998, he helped establish the annual Kraljevdan event as a celebration of the city's royalist history.Z. Nikoliƒá, \\"Kraljevo danas slavi svoj Kraljevdan\\", Danas, 7 October 2016, accessed 21 August 2017. He called on other Serbian towns to take in more Kosovo Serb refugees the following year, after Kraljevo's resources were challenged by a large number of refugees converging on the city.\\"Kraljevo mayor wants Kosovo Serbs accommodated in other Serbian towns,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European - Political, 1 September 1999 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 1617 gmt 1 Sep 99). This article's description of Joviƒá as having been the city's mayor in 1998 appears to be inaccurate. Serbia's political system was reformed for the 2000 parliamentary election, the first to be held after the downfall of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's administration. The entire country became a single electoral district, and mandates were awarded to parties instead of individual candidates, with the result that successful parties often distributed their mandates out of numerical order to candidates on their electoral lists.Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84). See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via LegislationOnline, accessed 28 February 2017. The SPO ran its own slate rather than joining a broad coalition called the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which consisted of several parties that had opposed Milo≈°eviƒá's rule. This proved to be a strategic error; the DOS won a landslide victory while the SPO did not receive a sufficient number of votes to cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly. Joviƒá, who was included in the SPO list, saw his parliamentary career come to a temporary end.Joviƒá received the seventy- seventh position on the party's list, which was mostly arranged in alphabetical order.

The County of Savoy and the Plantaganet monarchy of England had been linked by the marriage of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence in 1236. Eleanor of Provence was the daughter of Beatrice of Savoy. In 1252 Peter I, Count of Savoy introduced the son of Peter, Lord of Grandson to the English Court, Otto de Grandson. The young Otto became a childhood friend of the young English Prince Edward, later to become King Edward I. In 1268 both prince and servant were knighted and in 1271 the latter accompanied his lord on the Ninth Crusade, where he served at Acre that year. According to one source, it was Otto, not Eleanor of Castile, who sucked the poison from the wounded Edward after an attempted assassination. In 1272 Otto was appointed an executor in Acre. Returning to England, Otto accompanied Edward in the Welsh Wars as his right-hand man, but also enlisted a whole retinue of fellow Savoyard knights in the service of the English crown.

The election, in which he defeated Nicholas Robinson, was mired by accusations of corruption. Parliamentary historian Margaret Escott says that the 1827 mayoral election, which the plumber and painter Porter won by 1780 votes to 1765 in a poll that lasted six days, was \\"the most expensive, venal and violent mayoral contest\\" up to that time. Porter, who was a Whig, had the support of the Liverpool Mercury while Robinson, a corn merchant, was favoured by the Corporation. Escott says that the main issues were \\"management of the docks, local commerce, ‚Äòjunta‚Äô domination and proposals for a householder and property-based franchise\\". Votes were bought at prices ranging between ¬£6 and ¬£50, with the candidates spending in total around ¬£8000-10000 each. The two sides co-operated with a subsequent inquiry that resulted in three people being prosecuted and disenfranchised for bribery. There had been 3545 voters and the situation was fuelled by the economic expansion of the city, which meant that some people were awash with money. Robinson was elected as mayor unopposed in the following year. Porter Street in Liverpool was named after Thomas Porter. He had a business manufacturing white lead on Mill Lane, which later became a continuation of Great Howard Street. From 1827 until his death, he lived at a large house, variously described as being in St Anne Street and in Mansfield Street, that later became judge's lodgings. It had been constructed and briefly occupied by Samuel Sandbach, who was another mayor of Liverpool. Although not interested in politics, his oldest son, also called Thomas, married the daughter of Charles Horsfall, who was another Liverpool mayor.

It was the first book of Vallejo's to be published. Los heraldos negros is also the name of the first poem in the collection.  Literary Context  At the beginning of the 20th century Latin American literature found itself under the influence of modernist poetry, the most salient examples of which were Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Jos√© Santos Chocano, Leopoldo Lugones, among others, all of whom were known and read by Vallejo. In the years of the creation of Los heraldos negros (1915-1918), Vallejo was taking part in the literary group in Trujillo known as \\"La bohemia trujillana\\" (later known as the Grupo Norte) and became friends with Jos√© Eulogio Garrido y Antenor Orrego, both of whom were knowledgeable about the literary developments of their day. It was thanks to these relationships that Vallejo became acquainted with the poetry of Julio Herrera y Reissig, the Uruguayan modernist whose writings also influenced Vallejo. At the end of 1917 Vallejo moved to Lima where he met writers and intellectuals such as Abraham Valdelomar and his Col√≥nida literary group.  Publication  Los heraldos negros was published by the printing presses of the Lima Penitentiary. The work was originally meant to be published in 1918, but it was delayed on account of Vallejo's waiting in vain for his friend Abraham Valdelomar to write the introduction. Los heraldos negros finally appeared in 1919 in a short print run.

Bihar is India's most flood-prone State, with 76% of the population in the North Bihar living under the recurring threat of flood devastation. Devastating flood was caused due to excess heavy rainfall in monsoon season. Events This flood was result of sudden increase in water discharge due to torrential rain in the foothill of the Himalayas in Nepal and adjoining areas in Bihar between August 12 and 20 led to flash flood in various rivers ‚Äî Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda ‚Äî due to heavy rain in the catchment areas of the major rivers of North Bihar in Nepal.

Disability is defined as the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. Disabled people are one of the most marginalised, excluded and poorest groups in Zimbabwean society. People with disabilities in Zimbabwe are treated as second-class citizens. It is estimated about 900 000‚Äì1.4 million people have some sort of disability in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Demographics  It is estimated that disability in Zimbabwe is 7% out of the total population which prevails in Zimbabwe. Disability exists in Zimbabwe mainly due to diseases, war conflicts, malnutrition, accidents, abnormal births, hereditary characteristics, etc. A large population of individuals with disabilities are children and young people. According to UNICEF as many as 600,000 children are living with some form of disability in Zimbabwe. About 53% of people living with disability population in Zimbabwe became disabled before the age of 20 years. Around 27% of disability with population from the birth while 9% disability exists between the ages limit of 1‚Äì5. The disability population of males is estimated approximately about 56% while the disability population of women is around 44% as of 2013. About 600 000 children live with disabilities in Zimbabwe according to the Department of International Development Zimbabwe as of 2013.  Education  Shepherd and his bird in Zimbabwe Around 52% of the disabled children in Zimbabwe have no access to education although Zimbabwe having a record of 93% literacy rate among its school-going children, which is also the best in the African continent. On the other hand, it was evident that about 34% of disabled women did not attend the school while 22% of disabled men did not attend the school. In Zimbabwe, we still have a situation where a good number of disabled children do not attend school. Planning for services without more current trends for children with disabilities is therefore a major challenge, compounded further by poor systems of routine data collection and management on the number of children receiving services. In Zimbabwe, children with disabilities live under especially difficult, challengeable circumstances and are vulnerable as they live with negative attitudes, beliefs, customs, etc. People with disabilities looked at the constitution making process as their biggest opportunity to have their dreams realized and they had numerous expectations including increased opportunities in health, education, social protection, habitation, participation and employment. Despite the advent of inclusive education learners with disabilities still face attitudinal, structural and physical barriers in accessing quality education.  Employment  According to statistics, around 83% of women have been unemployed who have disabilities while about 74% of disabled men population have been unemployed. It is a common perception within Zimbabwe that disabled people are passive, inactive, economically inactive and unproductive and therefore constitute a \\"burden\\" upon the society.  Legislation  Zimbabwe was one of the first countries in the world to enact disability discrimination legislation. Zimbabwe ratified the CRPD and its Optional Protocol on 23 September 2013, thereby becoming the 135th state party to ratify the Convention and its protocol. Zimbabwe is the State Party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to the Rights of the Child. The Disabled Persons Act is the primary law that addresses disability in Zimbabwe.This act provides for welfare and rehabilitation of PWDs. The mental health provides for the consolation and amendment of the law relating to the care, detention and aftercare of persons with mental disabilities for the purpose of treatment.  Health care challenges  Many disabled individuals are unable to access health care due to the limited number of clinics and the distances they need to travel in order to get to a doctor. Some public transport providers force wheelchair users to pay extra to ride. People with disability have the same general health care needs as everyone else, and therefore need access to mainstream health care services. People with disabilities need health care and health programs for the same reasons anyone else does‚Äîto stay well, active, and a part of the community. Women with disabilities in Zimbabwe face numerous challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health.  Advocacy  There are a few organisations in Zimbabwe which represent and advocate for disabled people. They are #Alive Albinism Initiative, looks out for the welfare of Persons With Albinism in Zimbabwe. The organization aims to ensure that Persons With Albinism are economically empowered. # Association of the Deaf in Zimbabwe -Representative organisation for Persons with deafness and speech functional disabilities. # Council for Blind - This council plays a role with regards to persons with visual impairments. # Danhiko Project - Educational and vocational training institution for persons with disabilities. # Disabled Women Support Organisation - Advocates for rights of women with disabilities. Sport = Paralympics = Zimbabwe has been competing at the Paralympic Games since independence in 1980; it had previously competed as Rhodesia at the 1972 Summer Paralympics. Zimbabwe was absent from the Games in 1988 and 1992, returning in 1996 with a two-man delegation, and has competed at every edition of the Summer Paralympics since then. It has never entered the Winter Paralympics.Zimbabwe at the Paralympics, International Paralympic Committee = Deaflympics = Zimbabwe competed at the Deaflympics only once with making their debut at the 1993 Summer Deaflympics.

Xun Xu stepped up, held a funeral for Cao Shuang, and inspired others to follow him.(Êó¢Èï∑ÔºåÈÅÇÂçöÂ≠∏ÔºåÈÅîÊñºÂæûÊîø„ÄÇ‰ªïÈ≠èÔºåËæüÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÊõπÁàΩÊéæÔºåÈÅ∑‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈÄö‰∫ãÈÉé„ÄÇÁàΩË™ÖÔºåÈñÄÁîüÊïÖÂêèÁÑ°Êï¢ÂæÄËÄÖÔºåÂãñÁç®Ëá®Ëµ¥ÔºåÁúæ‰πÉÂæû‰πã„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Xun Xu later became the Prefect of Anyang County (ÂÆâÈôΩÁ∏£) and an assistant to the General of Agile Cavalry. During his tenure in Anyang County, Xun Xu gained so much respect and love from the local residents that they even built a shrine to honour him. He was subsequently held the following appointments: Judge under the Minister of Justice (Âª∑Â∞âÊ≠£), military adviser to the regent Sima Zhao, official in the Hall of Records (Ë®òÂÆ§). He was also ennobled as a Secondary Marquis (ÈóúÂÖß‰æØ).(ÁÇ∫ÂÆâÈôΩ‰ª§ÔºåËΩâÈ©ÉÈ®éÂæû‰∫ã‰∏≠ÈÉé„ÄÇÂãñÊúâÈÅ∫ÊÑõÔºåÂÆâÈôΩÁîüÁÇ∫Á´ãÁ•†„ÄÇÈÅ∑Âª∑Â∞âÊ≠£ÔºåÂèÉÊñáÂ∏ùÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçËªç‰∫ãÔºåË≥úÁàµÈóúÂÖß‰æØÔºåËΩâÂæû‰∫ã‰∏≠ÈÉéÔºåÈ†òË®òÂÆ§„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. In 260, the fourth Wei emperor, Cao Mao, attempted a coup to seize back power from the regent, Sima Zhao, who had been monopolising state power since 255. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan, heard of the coup and tried to enter the palace to help his brother. However, he was denied entry by Sun You (Â≠´‰Ωë), an officer guarding the main gate, so he had to enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found out why Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that it would be unfair and unjust to punish Sun You's family as well. Sima Zhao heeded Xun Xu's advice and punished Sun You only, by demoting him to the status of a commoner.(È´òË≤¥ÈÑâÂÖ¨Ê¨≤ÁÇ∫ËÆäÊôÇÔºåÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÊéæÂ≠´‰ΩëÁ≠âÂÆàÈñ∂ÈóîÈñÄ„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂºüÂÆâÈôΩ‰æØÂππËÅûÈõ£Ê¨≤ÂÖ•Ôºå‰ΩëË¨ÇÂππÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊú™ÊúâÂÖ•ËÄÖÔºåÂèØÂæûÊù±ÊéñÈñÄ„ÄÇ„ÄçÂèäÂππËá≥ÔºåÂ∏ùÈÅ≤‰πãÔºåÂππ‰ª•ÁãÄÁôΩÔºåÂ∏ùÊ¨≤ÊóèË™Ö‰Ωë„ÄÇÂãñË´´Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ≠´‰Ωë‰∏çÁ¥çÂÆâÈôΩÔºåË™†ÂÆúÊ∑±Ë≤¨„ÄÇÁÑ∂‰∫ãÊúâÈÄÜÈ†ÜÔºåÁî®Âàë‰∏çÂèØ‰ª•ÂñúÊÄíÁÇ∫ËºïÈáç„ÄÇ‰ªäÊàêÂÄÖÂàëÊ≠¢ÂÖ∂Ë∫´Ôºå‰Ωë‰πÉÊóèË™ÖÔºåÊÅêÁæ©Â£´ÁßÅË≠∞„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂÖç‰ΩëÁÇ∫Â∫∂‰∫∫„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Around the same time, Lu Yi (Ë∑ØÈÅ∫), a cavalry officer, requested permission from Sima Zhao to infiltrate Wei's rival state, Shu Han, and assassinate Shu's leaders. Xun Xu advised Sima Zhao against using assassination because he believed that defeating Shu forces in battle was a better way of convincing the people of Shu to surrender and for Sima Zhao to gain greater prestige. Sima Zhao praised Xun Xu for his sound advice.(ÊôÇÂÆòÈ®éË∑ØÈÅ∫Ê±ÇÁÇ∫Âà∫ÂÆ¢ÂÖ•ËúÄÔºåÂãñË®ÄÊñºÂ∏ùÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòéÂÖ¨‰ª•Ëá≥ÂÖ¨ÂÆ∞Â§©‰∏ãÔºåÂÆúÊùñÊ≠£Áæ©‰ª•‰ºêÈÅïË≤≥„ÄÇËÄåÂêç‰ª•Âà∫ÂÆ¢Èô§Ë≥äÔºåÈùûÊâÄË¨ÇÂàëÊñºÂõõÊµ∑Ôºå‰ª•Âæ∑ÊúçÈÅ†‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùÁ®±ÂñÑ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. In 264, the Wei general Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao after leading Wei forces to conquer Shu. At the time, Sima Zhao only heard rumours about the rebellion and had no concrete evidence yet. As he had all along treated Zhong Hui well, he was reluctant to believe that Zhong would rebel against him. After Xun Xu cautioned him against trusting Zhong Hui, Sima Zhao led his forces to garrison at Chang'an as a precautionary measure. Guo Yi (ÈÉ≠Â•ï) and Wang Shen (ÁéãÊ∑±) urged Sima Zhao to banish Xun Xu because they feared that he would side with Zhong Hui, given that he was raised by the Zhong family (Zhong Hui was Zhong Yao's son). However, Sima Zhao ignored them and continued to treat Xun Xu as he did before, and even allowed Xun Xu to ride in the same carriage as him. Previously, when Sima Zhao ordered Zhong Hui to lead Wei forces to conquer Shu, Xun Xu had nominated Wei Guan to supervise the campaign. Later, Wei Guan played a huge role in suppressing Zhong Hui's rebellion. After Shu had been pacified, Xun Xu followed Sima Zhao back to the Wei capital, Luoyang, where he, Pei Xiu and Yang Hu were put in charge of the privy council.(ÂèäÈêòÊúÉË¨ÄÂèçÔºåÂØ©ÂïèÊú™Ëá≥ÔºåËÄåÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÂÖàÂëä‰πã„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂæÖÊúÉÁ¥†ÂéöÔºåÊú™‰πã‰ø°‰πü„ÄÇÂãñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊúÉÈõñÂèóÊÅ©ÔºåÁÑ∂ÂÖ∂ÊÄßÊú™ÂèØË®±‰ª•Ë¶ãÂæóÊÄùÁæ©Ôºå‰∏çÂèØ‰∏çÈÄüÁÇ∫‰πãÂÇô„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùÂç≥Âá∫ÈéÆÈï∑ÂÆâÔºå‰∏ªÁ∞øÈÉ≠Â•ï„ÄÅÂèÉËªçÁéãÊ∑±‰ª•ÂãñÊòØÊúÉÂæûÁî•ÔºåÂ∞ëÈï∑ËàÖÊ∞èÔºåÂã∏Â∏ùÊñ•Âá∫‰πã„ÄÇÂ∏ù‰∏çÁ¥çÔºåËÄå‰ΩøÂãñÈô™‰πòÔºåÂæÖ‰πãÂ¶ÇÂàù„ÄÇÂÖàÊòØÔºåÂãñÂïü„Äå‰ºêËúÄÔºåÂÆú‰ª•Ë°õÁìòÁÇ∫Áõ£Ëªç„Äç„ÄÇÂèäËúÄ‰∏≠‰∫ÇÔºåË≥¥Áìò‰ª•Êøü„ÄÇÊúÉÂπ≥ÔºåÈÇÑÊ¥õÔºåËàáË£¥ÁßÄ„ÄÅÁæäÁ•úÂÖ±ÁÆ°Ê©üÂØÜ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. After eliminating Shu, Sima Zhao planned to conquer Wei's other rival state, Eastern Wu, so he sent an emissary to pass a letter to the Wu emperor, Sun Hao. Sima Zhao had previously ordered his subordinates to draft the letter to Sun Hao. Among the numerous drafts he read, he eventually chose the one written by Xun Xu. Sun Hao agreed to make peace with Wei after reading the letter. Sima Zhao remarked that Xun Xu's letter had the power equivalent to that of an army of 100,000. In mid 264, the fifth Wei emperor, Cao Huan, conferred Sima Zhao the title of a vassal king, \\"King of Jin\\" (ÊôâÁéã). Xun Xu was appointed as a Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠), and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Anyang (ÂÆâÈôΩ‰æØ) and given 1,000 taxable households for his marquisate.(ÊôÇÂ∞áÁôº‰ΩøËÅòÂê≥Ôºå‰∏¶ÈÅ£Áï∂ÊôÇÊñáÂ£´‰ΩúÊõ∏ËàáÂ≠´ÁöìÔºåÂ∏ùÁî®ÂãñÊâÄ‰Ωú„ÄÇÁöìÊó¢Â†±ÂëΩÂíåË¶™ÔºåÂ∏ùË¨ÇÂãñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõÂâç‰ΩúÊõ∏Ôºå‰ΩøÂê≥ÊÄùÈ†ÜÔºåÂãùÂçÅËê¨‰πãÁúæ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùÂç≥ÊôâÁéã‰ΩçÔºå‰ª•ÂãñÁÇ∫‰æç‰∏≠ÔºåÂ∞ÅÂÆâÈôΩÂ≠êÔºåÈÇëÂçÉÊà∂„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Overview of service under the Jin dynasty Following Sima Zhao's death in September 265, in February 266 the Wei emperor Cao Huan abdicated his throne to Sima Zhao's son, Sima Yan, who established the Jin dynasty to replace Wei. After Sima Yan was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Wu, he enfeoffed Xun Xu as the Duke of Jibei Commandery (ÊøüÂåóÈÉ°ÂÖ¨). However, Xun Xu declined the enfeoffment after seeing that Yang Hu also declined his. However, he still remained as a marquis under the new title \\"Marquis of Jibei\\" (ÊøüÂåó‰æØ). Xun Xu was then concurrently appointed as Supervisor of the Palace Writers (‰∏≠Êõ∏Áõ£), Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠), and zhuzuo (Ëëó‰Ωú; senior writer). The emperor also tasked him and Jia Chong with drafting the laws of the Jin dynasty.(Ê≠¶Â∏ùÂèóÁ¶™ÔºåÊîπÂ∞ÅÊøüÂåóÈÉ°ÂÖ¨„ÄÇÂãñ‰ª•ÁæäÁ•úËÆìÔºå‰πÉÂõ∫Ëæ≠ÁÇ∫‰æØ„ÄÇÊãú‰∏≠Êõ∏Áõ£ÔºåÂä†‰æç‰∏≠ÔºåÈ†òËëó‰ΩúÔºåËàáË≥àÂÖÖÂÖ±ÂÆöÂæã‰ª§„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. In the early Xianning era (275‚Äì280), Emperor Wu named Xun Xu, Shi Bao and others as the pioneers of the Jin dynasty and included them among those honoured in the Jin dynasty's ancestral temple. Around 280, when Wang Jun requested permission to lead an army to conquer Eastern Wu (the last of the Three Kingdoms), Xun Xu and Jia Chong strongly objected but Emperor Wu ignored them and ordered Wang Jun and others to lead Jin forces on an invasion of Wu. The invasion turned out successful and led to the reunification of China under the Jin dynasty. When Emperor Wu assessed Xun Xu's contributions in helping him draft imperial edicts, he rewarded Xun Xu by enfeoffing one of his sons as a village marquis with 1,000 taxable households in his marquisate and awarding him 1,000 rolls of silk.(Âí∏ÁîØÂàùÔºåËàáÁü≥ËãûÁ≠â‰∏¶ÁÇ∫‰ΩêÂëΩÂäüËá£ÔºåÂàóÊñºÈäòÈ•ó„ÄÇÂèäÁéãÊµöË°®Ë´ã‰ºêÂê≥ÔºåÂãñËàáË≥àÂÖÖÂõ∫Ë´´‰∏çÂèØÔºåÂ∏ù‰∏çÂæûÔºåËÄåÂê≥ÊûúÊªÖ„ÄÇ‰ª•Â∞àÂÖ∏Ë©îÂëΩÔºåË´ñÂäüÂ∞ÅÂ≠ê‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÁÇ∫‰∫≠‰æØÔºåÈÇë‰∏ÄÂçÉÊà∂ÔºåË≥úÁµπÂçÉÂåπ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39.

Around the time, there was much discussion in the imperial court over the issue of restoring the nobles to their fiefs and allowing them to govern from their respective fiefs. When Emperor Wu sought his opinion, Xun Xu disapproved because he believed that since the nobles also held gubernatorial appointments, they might neglect their original jurisdictions once they return to their respective fiefs. He also pointed out the possible complications such as having to subdivide the fiefs into commanderies and counties, as well as the risk of making people unhappy since the subdividing would require relocating residents from one area to another. He further pointed out that they would need to reassign troops from the borders and place them under decentralised command in the various fiefs. When Emperor Wu asked Xun Xu to reconsider his views, Xun Xu explained further that the best course of action was to maintain the status quo, since the redrawing of boundaries between the fiefs might lead to resentment and potential unrest if it was not carefully managed. He also pointed out that there were far more important issues that required immediate attention, so they should focus on those first. Emperor Wu thought that Xun Xu's advice was appropriate and heeded it.(ÊôÇË≠∞ÈÅ£ÁéãÂÖ¨‰πãÂúãÔºåÂ∏ù‰ª•ÂïèÂãñÔºåÂãñÂ∞çÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË´∏ÁéãÂÖ¨Â∑≤ÁÇ∫ÈÉΩÁù£ÔºåËÄå‰Ωø‰πãÂúãÔºåÂâáÂª¢Êñπ‰ªª„ÄÇÂèàÂàÜÂâ≤ÈÉ°Á∏£Ôºå‰∫∫ÂøÉÊàÄÊú¨ÔºåÂøÖÁî®Âó∑Âó∑„ÄÇÂúãÁöÜÁΩÆËªçÔºåÂÆòÂÖµÈÇÑÁï∂Áµ¶ÂúãÔºåËÄåÈóïÈÇäÂÆà„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùÈáç‰ΩøÂãñÊÄù‰πãÔºåÂãñÂèàÈô≥Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ¶ÇË©îÂáÜÂè§Êñπ‰ºØÈÅ∏ÊâçÔºå‰ΩøËªçÂúãÂêÑÈö®ÊñπÈù¢ÁÇ∫ÈÉΩÁù£ÔºåË™†Â¶ÇÊòéÊó®„ÄÇËá≥ÊñºÂâ≤Ê≠£Â∞ÅÁñÜ„ÄÇ‰ΩøË¶™Áñè‰∏çÂêåË™†ÁÇ∫‰Ω≥Áü£„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÂàÜË£ÇËàäÂúüÔºåÁå∂ÊáºÂ§öÊâÄÊêñÂãïÔºåÂøÖ‰Ωø‰∫∫ÂøÉËÅ∞ÊìæÔºåÊÄùÊÉüÁ´äÂÆúÂ¶ÇÂâç„ÄÇËã•Êñº‰∫ã‰∏çÂæó‰∏çÊôÇÊúâÊâÄËΩâÂ∞ÅÔºåËÄå‰∏çËá≥ÂàÜÂâ≤ÂúüÂüüÔºåÊúâÊâÄÊêçÂ•™ËÄÖÔºåÂèØÈö®ÂÆúÁØÄÂ∫¶„ÄÇÂÖ∂‰∫îÁ≠âÈ´îÂúãÁ∂ìÈÅ†ÔºåÂØ¶‰∏çÊàêÂà∂Â∫¶„ÄÇÁÑ∂‰ΩÜËôõÂêçÔºåÂÖ∂ÊñºÂØ¶‰∫ãÔºåÁï•ËàáËàäÈÉ°Á∏£ÈÑâ‰∫≠ÁÑ°Áï∞„ÄÇËã•ÈÄ†Ê¨°ÊîπÂ•™ÔºåÊÅê‰∏çËÉΩ‰∏ç‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÊÅ®„ÄÇ‰ªäÊñπ‰∫ÜÂÖ∂Â§ßËÄÖÔºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰∫îÁ≠âÂèØÈ†àÂæåË£ÅÂ∫¶„ÄÇÂá°‰∫ãÈõñÊúâ‰πÖËÄåÁõäÂñÑËÄÖÔºåËã•Ëá®ÊôÇÊàñÊúâ‰∏çËß£Ôºå‰∫¶‰∏çÂèØÂøΩ„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ù‰ª•ÂãñË®ÄÁÇ∫ÂÖÅÔºåÂ§öÂæûÂÖ∂ÊÑè„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Around the time, the imperial court was discussing a proposal to retrench about half the number of officials in commanderies and counties to free up labour for agricultural works. Xun Xu cited examples from the Han dynasty and gave a long explanation on why he believed that the best solution was to reduce the layers of bureaucracy in the administration. He pointed out how doing so could help to discourage officials from corrupt behaviour, improve administrative efficiency, and build up greater social trust among the masses. He often applied such critical analysis in assessing the costs and benefits of government policies.(ÊôÇÂèàË≠∞ÁúÅÂ∑ûÈÉ°Á∏£ÂçäÂêè‰ª•Ëµ¥Ëæ≤ÂäüÔºåÂãñË≠∞‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ôºö„ÄåÁúÅÂêè‰∏çÂ¶ÇÁúÅÂÆòÔºåÁúÅÂÆò‰∏çÂ¶ÇÁúÅ‰∫ãÔºåÁúÅ‰∫ã‰∏çÂ¶ÇÊ∏ÖÂøÉ„ÄÇ ...

In the Taikang era (280‚Äì289), Emperor Wu issued an imperial edict to praise Xun Xu for his talents and contributions, and said that he was capable of assuming greater responsibilities. He then appointed Xun Xu as a Household Counsellor (ÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´) to be treated like one of the Three Ducal Ministers, as well as allowing Xun Xu to have his own administrative office, in addition to his existing appointments as Supervisor of the Palace Writers (‰∏≠Êõ∏Áõ£) and Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠). Around the time, Jia Chong and Li Yin were already dead and the position of Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™ÂÇÖ) was vacant. Xun Xu wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu, nominating Yang Yao to be the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor, and either Wei Guan or Shan Tao to be the new Minister over the Masses.

Later, on a separate occasion, he appointed his subordinates Yin Xian (‰ºäÁæ®) and Zhao Xian (Ë∂ôÂí∏) as Members of the Retinue (Ëàç‰∫∫) and tasked them with drafting legislation. When Emperor Wu asked him why he did so, Xun Xu explained the importance of delegating responsibilities to subordinates. He also pointed out why he believed it was redundant to have officials focusing on drafting legislation only since their duties overlap with those of other officials, so it was better to delegate such additional responsibilities to the latter group.(ÂÖ∂ÂæåÈñÄ‰∏ãÂïüÈÄö‰∫ã‰ª§Âè≤‰ºäÁæ®„ÄÅË∂ôÂí∏ÁÇ∫Ëàç‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∞çÊéåÊñáÊ≥ï„ÄÇË©î‰ª•ÂïèÂãñÔºåÂãñÊõ∞Ôºö‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãÂπ∏Ë≥¥Èôõ‰∏ãËÅñÂæ∑ÔºåÂÖ≠ÂêàÁÇ∫‰∏ÄÔºåÊúõÈÅìÂåñÈöÜÊ¥ΩÔºåÂûÇ‰πãÂ∞á‰æÜ„ÄÇËÄåÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏äÁ®±Á®ãÂí∏„ÄÅÂºµÊÉ≤Ôºå‰∏ãÁ®±Ê≠§Á≠âÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª•ÊñáÊ≥ïÁÇ∫ÊîøÔºåÁöÜÊÑöËá£ÊâÄÊú™ÈÅîËÄÖ„ÄÇÊòîÂºµÈáã‰πãË´´Êº¢ÊñáÔºåË¨ÇÁç∏ÂúàÂóáÂ§´‰∏çÂÆúË¶ãÁî®ÔºõÈÇ¥Âêâ‰ΩèËªäÔºåÊòéË™øÂíåÈô∞ÈôΩ‰πãÊú¨„ÄÇÊ≠§‰∫å‰∫∫Ë±à‰∏çÁü•Â∞èÂêè‰πãÊÉ†ÔºåË™†ÈáçÊÉúÂ§ßÂåñ‰πü„ÄÇÊòîÈ≠èÊ≠¶Â∏ù‰Ωø‰∏≠ËªçÂè∏ËçÄÊî∏ÂÖ∏ÂàëÁçÑÔºåÊòéÂ∏ùÊôÇÁå∂‰ª•‰ªòÂÖßÂ∏∏‰æç„ÄÇ‰ª•Ëá£ÊâÄËÅûÔºåÊòéÂ∏ùÊôÇÂîØÊúâÈÄö‰∫ãÂäâÊ≥∞Á≠âÂÆòÔºå‰∏çÈÅéËàáÊÆø‰∏≠ÂêåËôüËÄ≥„ÄÇÂèàÈ†ÉË®ÄË´ñËÄÖÁöÜÈõ≤ÁúÅÂÆòÊ∏õ‰∫ãÔºåËÄåÊ±ÇÁõäÂêèËÄÖÁõ∏Â∞ãÁü£„ÄÇÂ§öÈõ≤Â∞öÊõ∏ÈÉéÂ§™‰ª§Âè≤‰∏çË¶™ÊñáÊõ∏Ôºå‰πÉÂßî‰ªòÊõ∏‰ª§Âè≤ÂèäÂππÔºåË™†ÂêèÂ§öÂâáÁõ∏ÂÄö‰πü„ÄÇÂ¢ûÁΩÆÊñáÊ≥ï‰πãËÅ∑ÔºåÈÅ©ÊÅêÊõ¥ËÄóÊìæÂè∞Èñ£ÔºåËá£Á´äË¨Ç‰∏çÂèØ„ÄÇ„Äç) Jin Shu vol. 39.

Xun Xu served as the Supervisor of the Palace Writers for a long time and had access to state secrets.

When he was serving as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he evaluated his subordinates based on their performance and dismissed those who failed to live up to his expectations. Emperor Wu once told Xun Xu that he hoped that Xun Xu would learn from Xun Yu and Xun You by promoting deserving officials and dismissing corrupt officials. A few months after Xun Xu assumed his new appointment, his mother died so he resigned and wanted to go home for filial mourning. However, Emperor Wu denied him permission and sent Zhou Hui (Âë®ÊÅ¢) to announce an imperial edict ordering him to return to his job.(Âãñ‰πÖÂú®‰∏≠Êõ∏ÔºåÂ∞àÁÆ°Ê©ü‰∫ã„ÄÇÂèäÂ§±‰πãÔºåÁîöÁΩîÁΩîÊÇµÊÅ®„ÄÇÊàñÊúâË≥Ä‰πãËÄÖÔºåÂãñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ•™ÊàëÈ≥≥ÁöáÊ±†ÔºåË´∏ÂêõË≥ÄÊàëÈÇ™ÔºÅ„ÄçÂèäÂú®Â∞öÊõ∏ÔºåË™≤Ë©¶‰ª§Âè≤‰ª•‰∏ãÔºåÊ†∏ÂÖ∂ÊâçËÉΩÔºåÊúâÊöóÊñºÊñáÊ≥ïÔºå‰∏çËÉΩÊ±∫ÁñëËôï‰∫ãËÄÖÔºåÂç≥ÊôÇÈÅ£Âá∫„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂòóË¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈ≠èÊ≠¶Â∏ùË®Ä'ËçÄÊñáËã•‰πãÈÄ≤ÂñÑÔºå‰∏çÈÄ≤‰∏çÊ≠¢ÔºõËçÄÂÖ¨ÈÅî‰πãÈÄÄÊÉ°Ôºå‰∏çÈÄÄ‰∏ç‰ºë'„ÄÇ‰∫å‰ª§Âêõ‰πãÁæéÔºå‰∫¶ÊúõÊñºÂêõ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ±ÖËÅ∑ÊúàÈ§òÔºå‰ª•ÊØçÊÜÇ‰∏äÈÇÑÂç∞Á∂¨ÔºåÂ∏ù‰∏çË®±„ÄÇÈÅ£Â∏∏‰æçÂë®ÊÅ¢ÂñªÊó®ÔºåÂãñ‰πÉÂ•âË©îË¶ñËÅ∑„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Association with Jia Chong, Jia Nanfeng and Sima Zhong When Emperor Wu wanted to reassign Jia Chong to guard the Guanzhong region, Xun Xu told his colleague Feng Dan that their status in the imperial court depended on Jia Chong's presence so they should try to stop the emperor from sending Jia Chong out of the imperial capital, Luoyang. Xun Xu thought of persuading Emperor Wu to arrange a marriage between Sima Zhong, the crown prince, and Jia Chong's daughter, Jia Nanfeng. In this way, Jia Chong, as the crown prince's father-in-law, would have to remain in Luoyang. Xun Xu and Feng Dan then sang praises of Jia Chong's daughter in front of Emperor Wu and managed to convince him to arrange the marriage. Many officials were disgusted by Xun Xu's fawning behaviour and called him a sycophant.(ÂÖÖÂ∞áÈéÆÈóúÂè≥‰πüÔºåÂãñË¨ÇÈ¶ÆÁ¥ûÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË≥àÂÖ¨ÈÅ†ÊîæÔºåÂêæÁ≠âÂ§±Âã¢„ÄÇÂ§™Â≠êÂ©öÂ∞öÊú™ÂÆöÔºåËã•‰ΩøÂÖÖÂ•≥ÂæóÁÇ∫Â¶ÉÔºåÂâá‰∏çÁïôËÄåËá™ÂÅúÁü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂãñËàáÁ¥û‰º∫Â∏ùÈñì‰∏¶Á®±„ÄåÂÖÖÂ•≥ÊâçËâ≤Áµï‰∏ñÔºåËã•Á¥çÊù±ÂÆÆÔºåÂøÖËÉΩËºî‰ΩêÂêõÂ≠êÔºåÊúâ„ÄäÈóúÈõé„ÄãÂêéÂ¶É‰πãÂæ∑„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÊàêÂ©ö„ÄÇÁï∂ÊôÇÁîöÁÇ∫Ê≠£Áõ¥ËÄÖÊâÄÁñæÔºåËÄåÁç≤‰ΩûÂ™ö‰πãË≠èÁÑâ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. Emperor Wu knew that Sima Zhong had developmental disability so he became worried that his son would bring disaster upon the Jin dynasty. He ordered Xun Xu and He Jiao to observe and evaluate Sima Zhong. Xun Xu praised Sima Zhong for being a virtuous crown prince, while He Jiao said that Sima Zhong was the same as before. He Jiao became respected for being honest about Sima Zhong, whereas Xun Xu was derided for lying in order to please the emperor.(ÊôÇÂ∏ùÁ¥†Áü•Â§™Â≠êÊöóÂº±ÔºåÊÅêÂæå‰∫ÇÂúãÔºåÈÅ£ÂãñÂèäÂíåÂ∂†ÂæÄËßÄ‰πã„ÄÇÂãñÈÇÑÁõõÁ®±Â§™Â≠ê‰πãÂæ∑ÔºåËÄåÂ∂†Èõ≤Â§™Â≠êÂ¶ÇÂàù„ÄÇÊñºÊòØÂ§©‰∏ãË≤¥Â∂†ËÄåË≥§Âãñ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39. In another incident, when Emperor Wu wanted to depose Jia Nanfeng from the position of crown prince's consort, Xun Xu and Feng Dan immediately went to plead with the emperor to reconsider his decision and eventually succeeded in dissuading him from deposing Jia Nanfeng. Many people believed that Xun Xu could potentially bring about the Jin dynasty's downfall and compared him unfavourably to Sun Zi and Liu Fang, who were seen as having caused the downfall of Wei.(Â∏ùÂ∞áÂª¢Ë≥àÂ¶ÉÔºåÂãñËàáÈ¶ÆÁ¥ûÁ≠âË´´Ë´ãÔºåÊïÖÂæó‰∏çÂª¢„ÄÇÊôÇË≠∞‰ª•ÂãñÂÇæÂúãÂÆ≥ÊôÇÔºåÂ≠´Ë≥á„ÄÅÂäâÊîæ‰πãÂåπ„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 39.

He made his fortune as a merchant in a partnership that traded with the West Indies and owned slaves.  Early life and mercantile career  Samuel Sandbach, whose father, Adam, was an innkeeper and farmer, was born in 1769 at Tarporley in Cheshire, England. In 1788, he left England to join his uncle, also called Samuel Sandbach, who had for many years been living and trading in Grenada. Around 1792, after working for some time as a clerk in firm that had been trading since around 1782 in one form or another, the partners were so impressed with the younger Samuel that they invited him to join their ranks. When trade and thus the income from it went into a downturn, two of the partners ‚Äî George Robertson, an older, long- established merchant, and Charles Stuart Parker ‚Äî decided to concentrate on development of existing plantations in Demerara. Parker, who was a nephew of Robertson, returned to Britain after two years. Sandbach and the remaining partner, McInroy, were left to look after the merchanting aspect of the partnership and in 1801 established the Demerara-based firm of McInroy, Sandbach & Co. Robertson died in 1799, by which time Parker was back in Demerara. He, Sandbach and McInroy all returned to Britain in the same year as McInroy, Sandbach & Co. was founded. They then set up McInroy, Parker & Co. in Glasgow before Sandbach moved to Liverpool to establish another branch of the enterprise. Parker had married a niece of Robertson's in 1797 and Sandbach's move to Liverpool coincided with his own marriage on 15 December 1802 to another niece, Elizabeth Robertson, who was the daughter of a clergyman. In 1813, the prosperous and well-connected Phillip Frederick Tinne, a Dutchman of Huguenot descent, joined the Liverpool firm, which became known as the \\"Rothchilds of Demerara\\", as a full partner. Until he formally left the firms in November 1833, when two of his sons took over his interest, Sandbach was a partner in the related businesses of Sandbach, Tinne & Co. (Liverpool), McInroy, Parker & Co. (Glasgow) and McInroy, Sandbach & Co. (Demerara). The enterprise grew to become owners of both ships and plantations and also exporters of coffee, molasses, rum and sugar from the West Indies to the British ports of Liverpool and Glasgow. They were significant slave owners until that practice was abolished, and from the 1830s until the 1920s were major transporters of indentured labour. Under the terms of the Slave Compensation Act 1837, Sandbach shared compensation of over ¬£35,000 for the liberation of over 500 slaves on two estates he co-owned. Sandbach was also for some time among the proprietors of the Herculaneum Pottery in Toxteth, Liverpool  Public life  Sandbach was elected to the Liverpool council in December 1827 following the death of J. B. Hollinshead, who had been at the forefront of an unsuccessful attempt to have him elected a few months earlier when Thomas Leyland had died. He was appointed as Bailiff in October 1828 and as mayor for 1831-32. He became High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1838, at which time his address was given at Hafodunos, Abergele. He had bought the Hafodunos estate in 1830. He was deputy chairman of the Bank of Liverpool by the mid-1840s, at which time he was also promoting a new company that intended to assist landowners in drainage of their properties.  Family  Samuel and Elizabeth Sandbach had several children, one of whom, Henry Robertson Sandbach, married Margaret Roscoe, a granddaughter of William Roscoe. He built and briefly lived at a Liverpool mansion, variously described as being in St Anne Street and in Mansfield Street, that then became home to Thomas Colley Porter, another mayor of the borough. He was living at Woodlands in Aigburth, near Liverpool, by 1832 and died there on 26 April 1851. Aside from his Welsh estate at Hafodunos, Sandbach had also bought estates around Calveley Hall and the Handley area of Cheshire.

The show stems from the anime series Fruity Musketeers (ÊûúÂÜª‰∏âÂâëÂÆ¢) and currently has four seasons. Plot =Season 1= When word spread that Lord Pitaya built a fruit processing factory on Mountain of Fruits and Flowers/The Fruity Mountain and poisoned the sacred Rainbow Lotus the Fruity Robo/Fruity Agents, a group of seven young fruits (an orange, a strawberry, two pineapples, a peach, an apple, and a grape), proceeded to charge up the mountain (with battle robots) with the hope of destroying the factory and saving the Rainbow Lotus. However, it was later revealed that Lord Pitaya was innocent. Fringo, an extra, had poisoned the Rainbow Lotusand ordered his fellow extras to spread rumors framing Lord Pitaya in order to win himself a lead role in the series. He and his friends stole the robots of the Fruity Elder Robos/Elder Fruity Agent sand battled against the Fruity Robo/Fruity Agentson the seventh layer of the mountain. The seventh layer constantly threatened to fall over, which would cause the entire world to be destroyed, so while they battled, Lord Pitaya and his friends used their robots to hold up the seventh layer. The members of the Fruity Robo/Fruity Agents were falling dead one by one, while Lord Pitayaand his friends were quickly running out of energy. The last Fruity Robo/Fruity Agent, Orangey/Mandarine, perished in order to use his righteous life energy as an energy source for the Fruity world. However, the entire team was quickly brought back to life, and got a Golden Upgrade as well. They would've been able to defeat Fringo, but when Orangey/Mandarine realized that Lord Pitaya was running out of energy and the seventh layer would tip over, they dropped their weapon, stopped fighting, and went to hold up the seventh layer. Fringo realized that he hasn't been a lead protagonist yet, so he revived the Rainbow Lotus and all the fruits celebrated...Until their celebration caused layer seven to fall over! Original Robo Fruit Part I =Season 2= When no new students showed up on the first day of the new school year, everyone was confused. Fringo, who claimed to be reformed, directed them towards the Ninja Academy established by Lord/Headmaster Pitaya and the (Four Heavenly Kings, previously the Criminal Four). While they were touring the school on layer six, a fight broke out on layer seven with Lord Pitaya battling Professor Nutty Maddo/Abbo Maddo and Mistress Plum/Elder Gal. The Three Musketeers rushed up the mountain as soon as they realized what was going on, and arrived in time to see Lord/Headmaster Pitaya kill Professor Nutty Maddo/Abbo Maddo and Mistress Plum/Elder Gal. Afterwards, their teachers and the girls arrived on the seventh layer, and they were framed for the action. Since then, they were shunned by everyone in their world. Suspicious that there may have been a larger conspiracy behind the school, they once again charged up the Mountain of Fruit and Flowers/The Fruity Mountain. Eventually, they made it to layer six, where they were deemed innocent by a court case. Then, they discovered that there had, indeed, been a conspiracy behind the school. Lord Pitaya had been in a pact with a human, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, where he would protect their world if Lord Pitaya stirred up conflict with the Fruity Robos/Fruity Agents and supplied him with fruits. Fruity Robo/Fruity Agents, along with many other fruits battled against the human, who revealed that he did not care about the well being of their world at all. Many died that day, including the Fruity Robo/Fruity Agents, but they were brought back to life. Eventually, they were able to blow the human's machete (\\"The most powerful knife in the world\\") into smithereens using one of Fringo's inventions. Then, they defeated him and sent him back to the human world, saving their world from annihilation... For now. Original Robo Fruits Part II =Season 3= Ninja-Turtle-Man destroys the holy Rainbow Lotus, causing the Fruity World to fall into discord and infighting. However, after the lotus died, three smaller lotuses bloomed in its place, and collecting the three lotuses together could grow a new Rainbow Lotus in its place. Pinero/Bennero Pineapple/Pineapplello, in an effort to protect the lotuses, accidentally opens up a portal, and both he and Ninja-Turtle-Man are sucked in. Pinero/Bennero Pineapple/Pineapplello reemerges in the Three Kingdoms Era in possession of the Yellow Lotus. In order to return to his own time period, he cracks a plan to get the Blue Lotus from Lord Pitaya and the pink lotus from Mistress Plum/Elder Gal. He recruits all of the Fruity Robo's ancestors, and they help him battle up the Mountain of Fruit and Flowers. Eventually, he finally has the means to plant another lotus, but Fringo, Bane, and Pina/Mary betray him. He ends up planting the lotus anyway, but Ninja-Turtle-Guy appears. Ninja-Turtle-Man was endangering the Rainbow Lotus, and Pineapplello jumped to defend it. However, he accidentally opened another spacetime portal. Instead of going back to where he came from, he ended up in the human world.

Plastic containers are ubiquitous either as single-use or reuseable/durable plastic cups, plastic bottles, plastic bags, foam food containers, Tupperware, plastic tubes, clamshells, cosmetic containers, up to intermediate bulk containers and various types of containers made of corrugated plastic. The entire packaging industry heavily depends on plastic containers or containers with some plastic content (e.g. plastic coating or when made of composite material), besides paperboard and other materials. Food storage nowadays relies mainly on plastic food storage containers. A basic but important distinction is between single-use / disposable and multi-use / durable containers. The former makes up a notable portion of the global plastic waste (e.g. toothpaste tubs, food delivery foam containers, most plastic bottles, etc.). Because of the multitude of container applications, the types of plastic vary widely. Because of the material variety (combinations are no exception), the waste will make up a significant portion of plainly visible plastic pollution although some containers like bottles are recyclable. Plastic has replaced traditional materials like wood, paperboard, and metal for the manufacture of containers because of its price, moldability/formability, durability and light weight. Alternatives such as cotton bags, cardboard boxes and aluminum cans often have larger ecological footprints because these use up more energy and water to manufacture and transport than their plastic equivalents. In addition, very few countries have facilities for recycling materials that are deemed to be less environmentally harmful than plastic. In most cases, this allegedly safe packaging gets in the natural landscape in the form of waste. Recently, some water bottles made of polystyrene and polycarbonate have been examined for contaminations by advanced laser spectroscopy method. Aluminum and cyanide were found as trace elements in the examined samples but they are considered to be toxic elements according to the United States food and drug administration (FDA). In 1997, the FDA set up Packaging and Contact Substances‚Äìa regulatory system to determine the safety of packaging products. Those who manufacture a' food touch material,' like chemical additives, coatings, paper or polymers, must first get their all right from the FDA before putting it on the market. Trade groups In the U.S., the industry is represented by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Closure & Container Manufacturers Association, Flexible Packaging Association, and others.  Global market  Asia Pacific dominated the global plastic packaging market in 2016. In second place comes North America. The pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries contributed the most to the use of plastic packaging products. During 2016, Asia Pacific accounted for more than 30 percent of the shares of the total volume consumption in this market. The Ocean Conservancy reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. In the late 2010s, 150 companies signed up to be part of The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's commitment to reduce plastic pollution. In a 2019 report, The Coca-Cola Company divulged the company created 3 million tons of plastic packaging in 2017 with Nestl√© creating 1.7 million tons, Unilever creating 610,000 tons and Colgate-Palmolive nearly 300,000 tons.

It was developed by Microsoft Research for the use of Operation ASHA ‚Äì an NGO dedicated to healthcare treatment, especially tuberculosis . It is used to ensure adherence to various protocols and for ensuring accurate measurements and transparency of operations. It is being used to provide adherence to the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-Course (DOTS) protocol of TB treatment in India and Cambodia. It has also been used by Operation ASHA to ensure patient adherence of hemophilia treatment protocol. eCompliance has been replicated by third parties in various countries, including Uganda, Kenya, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Afghanistan, and Tanzania. It has been rolled out for nearly 28,000 TB and hemophilia patients. The system has recorded over one million transactions. The tablet on which eCompliance is used on is connected to a central server through internet and updates that server whenever synced, allowing data to be easily accessed from a central server. It can hence work offline as well. Description For TB treatment, patients are enrolled into eCompliance by scanning their fingerprints at the time of registration into Operation ASHA‚Äôs program. Basic demographic data, like address and phone number, are recorded into the system along with the schedule of the patient for coming into Operation ASHA‚Äôs centers to take their medication. When the patients go to the treatment center to take their medication, their fingerprint is scanned along with the fingerprint of the health worker present.http://www.opasha.org/wp- content/uploads/2012/03/OpASHA_m4d2012-Practitioner-Paper_Published- Version.pdf Only then is the medicine given to the patient to swallow. The simultaneous scanning of both fingerprints is proof that the medicine was given under direct supervision, which is required by the DOTS protocol of TB treatment that Operation ASHA follows. If a patient fails to show up, the health worker gets a text message from the eCompliance system. The health worker then goes to the patient's house to give them the medication and scan their fingerprint as proof of medication intake. Thus, eCompliance has decreased the number of missed doses drastically and the default rate (i.e. the rate at which patients drop out of the treatment program) also reduces by a huge margin.  Research  In western Uganda, research was carried out to determine the efficacy and impact of eCompliance in TB treatment of patients . Through direct observation of 142 patients, DOTS outcomes of patients in the eCompliance intervention group were compared to patients in two control groups. It was found that the intervention patients had a higher cure rate than all other patients (55% versus 28.3%). The intervention group had a default rate to follow up rate lower than all other groups (0% versus 7%). Also, the intervention group had significantly lower odds of having a negative DOTS outcome (0% versus 17%). The perceived impact of eCompliance was evaluated by interviews with 8 health workers, 4 center owners, and 23 patients . It was found that eCompliance helps draw patients to treatment centers by incentivizing health workers to convince patients to come, and by persuading patients that in-person visits are important.

History On 21 August 1917, he took off from in a Sopwith Pup plane and shot down German airship Zeppelin LZ 66 (L 23) with 16 persons aboard over the North Sea, 40 km from Jutland's west coast beyond Stadil Fjord. =Downing of Airship L23= After destroying the airship Bernard A. Smart was actually unsure of where his support ships were located as he had been disoriented during the attack. Luckily the smoke from the airship attracted a British Navy squadron and he was able to ditch his plane in the water and was rescued by a British destroyer. On 19 July 1918, he was sent from HMS Furious ca. 15 miles west of Lyngvig lighthouse as a pilot on a Sopwith Camel plane and led to the T√∏nder Bombing Raid of the airship base in T√∏nder, where the air ships L 54 and L 60 were burned in the big Toska hall. Smart was honored 9 weeks after the shooting of L 23 with the DSO order. On board of HMS Furious in the presence of Admiral David Beatty, he was presented on 24 July 1918, to his great surprise for King George V, who decorated him with an extra bar as he already had the DSO order in advance. Home in Luton Bernard Arthur Smart was the son of Charles Smart and wife Kate in Luton and worked in the parents' company in 1911, producing straw hats. At the age of 24 years on 24 July 1916, he qualified to become a pilot at Royal Naval Air Service. After the war, in 1919, he retired as a pilot and became a businessman. In 1927, he became a cousin of Geoffrey Bowman Jenkins' company Bowman Models in Dereham, Norfolk, producing toys such as steam engines, boats, and locomotives.

It has a reputation as a manufacturer of luxury socks and its customers include the British royal family.  History of the business  Corgi was founded in 1892. It began as a maker of socks for Welsh miners and moved on to making argyle pattern socks for Brooks Brothers in 1939. Corgi made socks for the British troops during World War II. Over the years Corgi has gone in and out of different ownership, but has always been run by the Jones family. It was founded by Rhys Jones and is now run by his great, great grandchildren, siblings Chris Jones and Lisa Wood, who took over from their father Huw Jones in 1997 and transitioned the business from making socks under other people's labels to growing the Corgi brand. It has been a subsidiary of Dewhurst Dent PLC since 2008. Corgi now makes knitwear under its own brand as well as for designers like Burberry and Thom Browne. In 2015, the business expanded with a 3,000-square feet extension and new knitting machines.  Machinery and manufacture  Corgi uses many older machines in its manufacturing, including rare 125-year-old Griswold hand-knitting machines, and links the toes of its socks by hand using traditional methods. Knitwear is hand-framed and intricate intarsia designs can be created.  In the media  It is reported that the Queen buys her socks from Corgi, and Prince George has a jumper made by the company.

E. Caerwyn Williams in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (Oxford: OUP, 2004); online ed., ed. David Cannadine, October 2005, http://0-www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29549 (accessed August 28, 2017). Biography Wiliems's mother was Catherine, the illegitimate daughter of Meredydd ab Ifan of the Wynn family, and Wiliam ap Tomos ap Gronwy. Wiliems was brought up in the parish of Trefriw, Arllechwedd Isaf, Caernarfonshire, and is likely that Wiliems was educated in the Wynn family's own school (like William Morgan, who translated the Welsh Bible). The renaissance brought unprecedented interest in education to Wiliems's generation, and had a clear effect on his life. He attended Brasenose College, Oxford for a time, but clear records of his studies there are lacking because of confusion with other similarly named students, and it seems he did not take a degree. Rather he was ordained as an Anglican priest, serving as a curate for Trefriw from c. 1573. Accordingly, he was generally known to his contemporaries as Syr ('Sir') Thomas Wiliems, because this was the usual title for priests in Welsh at the time. However, Wiliems became a recusant, converting to Roman Catholicism, after which he worked as a physician (drawing on his extensive book-learning: qualifications as such were not required at the time). As a Catholic, Wiliems was denied access to printing, which perhaps helps to explain the focus of his scholarly activities on manuscript production. He died before August 13, 1623, at which time his uncle Sir John Wynn of the neighbouring Gwydir Castle, inscribed his name on the manuscript of Wiliem's dictionary's as its owner. Notes in Wiliems's manuscripts suggest he turned to Catholicism; he was certainly charged on that score at Bangor in 1607. Scholarship =Dictionary= Wiliems is best known for producing a Latin-Welsh dictionary in manuscript form (National Library of Wales, Peniarth 228), apparently between 4 May 1604 and 2 October 1607. He worked towards this by keeping a kind of commonplace book (Peniarth MS 188), which he systematised by essentially taking the Dictionarium Linguae Latinae et Anglicanae (1587) by Thomas Thomas, the first printer of Cambridge University, and adding Welsh to it. This was completed in 1607 and entitled Thesaurus Lingu√¶ Latin√¶ et Cambrobritannic√¶ or Trysawr yr iaith Laidin ar Gymraec, ne'r Geiriadur coheddocaf a'r wiriathaf o wir aleitiaith Vrytan√¶c, sef heniaith a chyphredin iaith yn y Brydain, ar Latin yn cyfateb pob gair. Wedy dechreu i scriuenu 4. Maij 1604. According to the prologue, Wiliems spent 30 years gathering material, and did so in order to promote the Welsh language, which was being spoken less and less by his contemporaries.Rhyddiaith Gymraeg: Y gyfrol gyntaf, Detholion o Lawysgrifau 1488‚Äì1609, ed. T. H. Parry Williams (1954). The dictionary was not published during Wiliems's lifetime, despite the efforts of Wiliems's friend John Edwards (of Plas Newydd, Chirk), who got part way through making a neater manuscript copy (Brogyntyn MSS 9 and 10). Wiliems left the manuscript of the dictionary to Sir John Wynn, who passed it to John Davies of Mallwyd, asking that Davies publish it, giving recognition to the author and a dedication to Sir John himself. John was already undertaking a Welsh-Latin dictionary and in the event published an abbreviation of Wiliems's Latin-Welsh dictionary in the second part of his own, which emerged as Antiquae Linguae Britannicae ... Dictionarum Duplex in 1632.Thomas Parry, Hanes Llenyddiaeth Gymraeg hyd 1900 (Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru, 1944). =Other works= According to Bishop Humphrey Humphreys, Wiliems compiled ‚Äòa pretty large Herbal in Latin, Welsh and English‚Äô. It is now lost, unless parts survive, copied by Thomas Evans, in Cardiff MS 2.973; but Wiliems certain consulted Llanstephan MS 10 and BL, Add. MS 14913 (containing Meddygon Myddfai). He seems to have translated the Trattato del sacramento della penitenza by Vincenzo Bruno SJ into Welsh, and compiled a collection of Welsh proverbs (surviving, in another's hand, in Mostyn MS 204). =Manuscript copying= Wiliams's family connections meant that he knew the owners of some of Wales's most important medieval manuscripts, and he began transcribing manuscripts already by the age of twenty-one. His copying included: * Many manuscripts of genealogical texts (e.g. ‚ÄòPrif Ach√¶ Holh Gymr√ª Benbaladr‚Äô, in NL Wales, MSS 16962 and 16963) * The historical texts Brut y Brenhinedd and Historia Dared (NL Wales, MS 5281), and the White Book of Rhydderch (Wiliems's manuscript of which included parts of the medieval manuscript now lost, though Wiliems's own copy now only survives through later copies of it).Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the \\"Englynion\\" (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 393. * A Latin text of the Welsh Laws (Peniarth MS 225) * Texts on grammar and lexicography, including part of the second part of Gruffydd Robert's grammar (Peniarth MS 62); Pum Llyfr Cerddwriaeth (Peniarth MS 62); two bardic grammars (Mostyn MS 110), and his copious summary of , although not in his hand), and selections of late medieval Welsh poetry (Peniarth MS 77, Havod MS 26). Appearances in popular culture It is rumoured that Wiliems was involved in the Gunpowder plot and, in warning his relative John Wynn not to go to the State Opening of Parliament in 1605, was responsible to either a smaller or greater extent for the suspicions which ultimately caught Guy Fawkes. This story is the basis for a short historical novel written for children by Gweneth Lilly, entitled Treason at Trefriw (Gomer Press, 1993).

During Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971, the US government was an ally of Pakistan and even sent its 7th fleet to intimidate India from interfering with the events in then East Pakistan. Background The Jessore Road (about long) was an important road connecting Bangladesh with West Bengal, India. The road was used by refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation war and the Bangladesh genocide to move to safety in India. Ginsberg wrote the poem after visiting the refugees on Jessore Road in 1971. He had first become aware of their suffering through the reports of foreign correspondents. History Ginsberg wrote the poem after visiting a refugee camp in West Bengal. He recited the poem at St. George's Episcopal Church in a poetry recitation program. Bob Dylan, who performed with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar and other musicians at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, later set the poem to music. Moushumi Bhowmik did a rendition of the poem in Bengali. Poem The September on Jessore Road Full Line > Millions of babies watching the skies > Bellies swollen, with big round eyes > On Jessore Road -long bamboo huts > No place to shit but sand channel ruts > Millions of fathers in rain > Millions of mothers in pain > Millions of brothers in woe > Millions of sisters nowhere to go > One Million aunts are dying for bread > One Million uncles lamenting the dead > Grandfather millions homeless and sad > Grandmother millions silently mad > Millions of daughters walk in the mud > Millions of children wash in the flood > A Million girls vomit & groan > Millions of families hopeless alone Millions of souls nineteen seventy one > Homeless on Jessore Road under grey sun > A million are dead, the million who can > Walk toward Calcutta from East Pakistan > Taxi September along Jessore Road > Oxcart skeletons drag charcoal load > Past watery field s through rain flood ruts > Dung cakes on tree trunks, plastic roof huts > Mother squats weeping and points to her sons > Standing thin legged like elderly nuns > Small bodied hands to their mouths in prayer > Five months small food since they settled there > On one floor mat with small empty pot > Father lifts up his hands at their lot > Tears come to their mother's eye > Pain makes mother ‚ÄòMaiya' cry' > On Jessore Road mother wept at my knees > Bengali tongue cried Mister please > Identity card torn up on the floor > Husband still waits at the camp office door > September Jessore Road rickshaw > 50,000 souls in one camp I saw > Rows of bamboo huts in the flood > Open drains, and wet families waiting for food > Border trucks flooded, food can't get past > American Angel machine please come fast! > Where is Ambassador Bunker today? > Are his Helios machines gunning children at play? > Where are the helicopters of US Aid? > Smuggling dope in Bangkok's green shade > Where is America's Air Force of Light? > Bombing North Laos all day all night > Where are the President's Armies of Gold > Billionaire Navies merciful Bold? > Bringing us medicine food and relief? > Napalming North Vietnam and causing more grief? > Where are our tears? Who weeps for the pain? > Where can these families go in the rain? > Jessore Road's children close their big eyes > Where will we sleep when our father dies? > Ring O ye tongues of the world for their woe > Ring out ye voices for Love we don't know > Ring out ye bells of electrical pain Ring in the conscious of American > brain. > The poem could not be presented in full but it contained main issues of the topic. Allen Ginsberg made it an epoch making poem giving details of his on the spot observation. It speaks of the whole of the people who fought for their mother tongue and also for freedom to lead a life of a heroic nation. Allen Ginsberg was bold enough voicing protest and hatred against his own government and the US President for waging war against Vietnam and also for supporting Pakistan for crushing freedom loving people of Bangladesh. But both US and Pakistan finally met the poetic justice as the both faced defeat at the hands of freedom loving people of Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Its importance is both that it gives a more detailed account of the local area than Domesday Book itself, and that its prologue offers an account of the terms of enquiry of the Domesday survey. Origins According to David C. Douglas, the Ely Inquiry was the product of an ecclesiastical landlord using the Domesday survey to produce a record of his own estatesJ. G. Edwards ed. Historical Essays in Honour of James Tait (Manchester 1933) p. 56 ‚Äì something supported by the way it records the lands of one tenant-in-chief across many different Domesday circuits.Ely Investigation Prologue The prologue to IE gives an account of the methods of the Domesday inquest, working by way of reports (under oath) of sheriffs, Barons \\"and of their Frenchmen and of the whole hundred, of the priest, the reeve, and six villeins of each vill\\".Quoted in D. Barber, The Early Middle Ages (London 1966) p. 92 It records a series of questions to be asked with respect to each manor, adding that all the answers were to be given in triplicate ‚Äì \\"hoc totum tripliciter\\" ‚Äì so as to cover three distinct times: Edward the Confessor's day, the time of the Conquest (1066), and the present-day (1086).J. Gillingham ed., Proceedings of the British Conference 2004 (2004) p. 132 and p. 149 While sometimes taken to fully reflect the actual Domesday process, the prologue is perhaps better seen as an abbreviated guide to the questions used,D.

They operate under their official website govoyagin.com In July 2015, Rakuten announced it acquired a majority stake in Voyagin to expand its travel market in Asia. Rakuten absorbed Voyagin on July 1, 2020, but continue to use the Voyagin website and name.  Business  Voyagin is a travel activities marketplace that allows travelers and locals to book tickets and tours in Asia and parts of Europe and the US.  History  The company was founded in January 2011 originally under the name of FindJPN by Masashi Takahashi and Hiroyuki Hayashi. Tushar Khandelwal came on board in 2012 and they relaunched the brand as Voyagin, a more global approach to booking tours and activities. It started as part of Open Network Lab, a Japanese incubator, and then raised seed funding from Digital Garage and other investors in 2012. They then raised a second round of funding of $500,000 in 2014, led by Singapore National Research Foundation and Jungle Ventures. On July 2, 2015, Rakuten announced their majority-stake acquisition of Voyagin after 6 months of talks, for an undisclosed figure, with the aim to expand their market share of the Asia travel industry. On April 20, 2020, Rakuten announced the decision to merge Voyagin into Rakuten. The absorption-type merger was completed on July 1, 2020.

Biography Carolina de Oliveira Louren√ßo was born on the city of Niter√≥i, in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, having lived on the Morro do Prevent√≥rio.

Prior to 1847 it was a small farming hamlet, which was transformed by the building of the East Coast Main Line railway. History The village is named after the Christon (originally Cryston) family, who were local yeoman farmers and members of the Quakers movement. In 1598 Thomas Cryston was recorded as the freeholder who held a quarter of a freehold in a local farm. The family eventually purchased the land outright from Henry Darling before it was sold in 1759 to Henry Taylor of Rock, who extended the property to the west. The farm was further expanded in the 19th century as it embraced the onset of modern farming methods such as new fertilisers, drainage and machinery.Keys To The Past Farm extended in 19th century. Today Christon Bank Farm is a Grade II listed buildingBritish Listed Buildings Grade II and history. and is still the predominant farm in the area. The predominance of farming in the locality led to the setting up of commercial lime production in the area in the early part of the 19th century. The lime was produced as fertiliser for the local farms. A kiln was constructed in the early 1800s followed by a second one later in the century. The OS map of 1865 also shows a lime works on the site and a small quarry. The site of the lime kilns is south-east of the village; both kilns are grade II listed buildings and received some renovation in 2005 with funding from DEFRA and co-operation from the local landowner.Stackyard News Details of Lime Kilns. Keys To The Past Details of Lime Kilns. Other industry in the immediate area at that time included small-scale coal mining; the mine to the south of the village on the road to Rennington produced coal to burn at the lime kilns and for local use.Embleton website General History. One of the lime kilns. Prior to the opening of the railway in 1847, Christon Bank consisted of just fourteen dwellings including two public houses, the Blink Bonny and the Rising Sun. The arrival of the railway and the accompanying station, transformed Christon Bank from a quiet farming hamlet to a busy village with the facilities of a main line station, which in 1885 dealt with over 10,000 passengers, over 6,000 livestock and 2,000 tons of raw materials. The raw materials included whinstone quarried at Embleton to the east and brought by cart. A -long tramway, known as Johnny‚Äôs Line, was built in 1895 to bring the stone directly from the quarry to the station. The tramway ran alongside the road from Embleton and had fallen out of use by the end of World War II.Visit Uk Details of station and quarry. The expansion of the village continued with the construction of a Primitive Methodist chapel in 1891 on the initiative of the station master Theopilus Moor and James Young who approached the Liberal statesman Sir Edward Grey for a donation of land which was approved; the first stone was laid in a special ceremony on 3 August 1891.Chronicle Live Details of chapel. Three more cottages were also built by the end of the century. In 1900 a laundry was set up by Lady Grey of nearby Fallodon to provide employment for local women; at that time the village had a population of 105 residents.Visit Uk General History. Present day A major expansion of the village started in the late 1980s with the building of the Mount View residential estate on land to the west of the railway. Further housing was built on the site of the old railway sidings to the east of the line. The station itself closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts, leaving the village with a feeling of a dormitory village, although the level crossing is in constant use with 100 trains a day passing through.ABC Railway Guide States 100 trains a day.

Description The Taveuni silktail is a small black bird, measuring around and weighing . It is a small, dumpy bird with long rounded wings, and a short rounded tail. The plumage of the male is velvet black with metallic blue iridescent spangling on the crown and breast, and silky white lower-back patch that travels most of the length down the tail. The margin of the tail is black, sometimes this tip has the same iridescence as other parts of the body. The female is similar to the male, except less glossy, and immature birds are duller than the adults and may have buffy rumps and backs. The irises of this species are dark, and the legs and bill are blackish. The bill is heavy and slightly hooked at the end. The legs are long and the feet strong. Distribution and habitat The Taveuni silktail is endemic to forests of Taveuni in Fiji. It occurs widely. It occurs in mature wet rainforests, as well as forest patches, and is also found in human- modified habitats such as logged forests and in plantations near patches of natural forest. Behaviour It can be quite elusive and difficult to see, but may also be confiding and approachable. It is usually very active at dawn, and is encountered either singly or in small flocks.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is the best-preserved section of modest houses constructed in Coldwater in the 1850s-1870s, and contains the former Lake Shore & Michigan Southern depot, constructed in 1883. History South Monroe Street was part of the original section of Coldwater, platted in 1831 by Allen Tibbits and Joseph Hanchett. It is likely, however, that it saw little or no development until about 1850. It was that year that the Michigan Southern Railroad (later the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway) completed its line across Michigan and through Coldwater. The first depot in Coldwater was located at the foot of South Monroe Street, suddenly making this section of Monroe a highly trafficked area. A small group of hotels, stables, and factories were constructed near the depot. (note: large pdf file) After the construction of the depot, residential construction along Monroe also began. Early residents included workers and business owners who likely chose the neighborhood because it was close to their place of work. For example, John P. Stuart (133 South Monroe) was station master of the depot. Ranson E. Hall (89 South Monroe) was a senior partner in R. E. Hall & Son, a watch and jewelry store located nearby on West Chicago. Frederick Myers (140 South Monroe) owned the City Bakery and Restaurant, also nearby on West Chicago. New houses were constructed in the district through the 19th century. In 1883, the present depot was constructed by the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway to replace the earlier 1850 depot. It is likely that some of the houses in the district were originally constructed elsewhere and move onto their current site - for example, both the Late Victorian house at 105 and the Greek Revival house at 108 South Monroe both appear to have been placed in the neighborhood in the early 1900s. The South Monroe Street Historic District continues to be one of the most significant concentrations of early Greek Revival and Italianate buildings in the Coldwater area. Passenger service using the Coldwater depot ended in 1956, and the depot building was then used as a freight office and a gift shop. It currently operates as the depot for a steam railway. Description The South Monroe Street Historic District contains 31 buildings, most of which were built as single-family dwellings. It also contains the former Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railroad depot, located at the foot of South Monroe. The houses are for primarily modest brick and frame Greek Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne buildings set on small lots. Four lots also contain old frame carriage houses. Of the frame houses, the most distinctive are the turreted Queen Anne located at 104 South Monroe and the unusual dwelling at 126 South Monroe, the home of architect Marcellus H. Parker. Parker's house is an L-plan structure with steeply pitched gable roofs, and two-story bay windows. The former Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railroad depot is a single, story, seven bay long Late Victorian brick structure with corbelled brickwork. It has a high gabled roof with broadly overhanging eaves supported by massive timber brackets.

According to the proposal of MoreSunlight, the current time of India, which is +530 UTC should be advance to +600 UTC. The project is a conception of many government officers, elected representatives, members of the scientific community in India and civil society organizations and ordinary citizens. Background India's current time is calculated from 82.5 longitude. This has been the established convention since 1906. Due to the geographical breadth of the country which spans 29 degrees of longitude there is a difference of 1 hour and 56 minutes between the extreme western and eastern parts of the country. Conveners of Project Moresunglight argues for calculating India's time zone from 90 degree east longitude http://www.businessworld.in/article/Shifting-India-s-Time-Zone-By-30-Minutes- Will-Have-Economic-Social-Health-And-Environmental-Benefits-Faisal- Farooqui/11-09-2017-125868/ Moreover, citizens in the north and north eastern parts of India tend to get less usable sunlight during their routine awake timings. There have been demands to split the country into two time zones. Some proposals have also called for daylight saving time concept as is prevalent in parts of Europe and America. The Government of India, has rejected both these demands. Solution to India's time situation Scientists and concerned citizens, at various forums have concluded that the best way to bring an optimum utilization of India's abundant sunlight is by advancing India's time by 30 minutes. Project Moresunlight proposes to educate the decision makers in India about the benefits of such an advancement, where India's new time zone would be +6:00 GMT. Benefits It is estimated that electricity worth more than 4000 crores a year will be saved by advancing IST by 30mins.

Prior to World War I, the eastern and southern Carpathian Mountains formed a natural border between the Austo-Hungarian Empire and Romania. Hungary and Romania became belligerents in World War I as Romania entered the war in 1916 on the side of the Allies. During that war the part of Transylvania south of the Maros (Mure»ô) and east of the Szamos (Some»ô) had been occupied by Romania forces at the time of the cease-fire agreement of Belgrade signed on 13 November 1918. On 1 December 1918, the National Assembly of Romanians in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (Alba Iulia) declared union with the Kingdom of Romania. Subsequently, the Romanian forces moved further into Hungary and occupied Budapest from August to mid-November 1919. The Treaty of Trianon finalized the armistice between the Allies and Hungary. In the treaty Romania received all of Transylvania (including parts of Maramure»ô, Banat and Cri»ôana), Romania's territorial losses in the summer of 1940, showing Northern Transylvania being ceded to the Kingdom of Hungary Briefly during World War II, Northern Transylvania (including part of Maramure»ô and Cri»ôana) was returned to Hungary under the Second Vienna Award in 1940. In 1944 as World War II drew to a close and Romania joined the war against Germany, the Allies agreed de facto to the Trianon boundaries, and this was confirmed at the Paris Peace Conference in 1946, and by the subsequent peace treaties formalized in 1947.

Early life  Littlefield first developed an interest in art and classicism while attending the Roxbury Latin School. Littlefield subsequently attended Harvard University, where he studied painting on the side with Adeline Wolever, a Canadian-American painter schooled in the traditional Boston School style of Frank Benson, Edmund Tarbell, and William Paxton. After graduating from Harvard in 1924, Littlefield departed for Paris to further his studies in painting, and where he met and shared a studio with the English painter and printmaker Stanley William Hayter.  Career  After returning to the U.S. in 1929 Littlefield settled first in Boston and then on his parents‚Äô property at Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod during the summers. It was in Falmouth where he would first explore landscape painting and where he would secure his first major commissions and exhibitions. In 1931, he was commissioned by Lincoln Kirstein to create stage sets for the American Ballet‚Äôs first production of Serenade and Mozartiana at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. He was invited in 1932 to participate in the Whitney Museum‚Äôs First Biennial and in 1936 a group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). He had his first solo exhibition at the Grace Horne Galleries in Boston in 1938. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1942, Littlefield volunteered to join the U.S. Army during World War II and served faithfully until he was discharged in 1945. After the war, Littlefield sold his house in Boston and relocated full-time to Falmouth. In 1947, Littlefield co-founded the Cape Cod Art Association. He first exhibited at the Provincetown Art Association in 1949. In the fall of 1951, Littlefield rented a studio in Manhattan to study with Morris Davidson and, during the summer of 1952, with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown.

Early life Rachel Beasley was born in Anderson County, Kentucky, on January 31, 1849. She is known to the literary world as \\"Mattie M'Intosh.\\" She was the fifth daughter of Judge Elisha Beasley and Almeda Penney, who reared eight girls, of whom Kate Carrington was the youngest. When she was an infant, her parents moved to Hickman County, Kentucky and settled in the town of Clinton, Kentucky. Judge Beasley gave his children every educational advantage within his reach, and the consequence was that the eight daughters became teachers. Career At the age of sixteen years Ray was left an orphan by the death of her mother, her father having died two years before. A few months later she entered Clinton Seminary, as both student and teacher. For fourteen years she was almost constantly employed in educational work, either as teacher or student, and often as both. She spent every spare moment during that time in writing stories, poems and practical articles. Her last school work was done in Clinton College (Kentucky), where she acted in the capacity of both student and teacher. For many years she indulged her fondness for the pen by contributing largely to different weeklies and periodicals. \\"The Ruined Home,\\" a continued story, published in 1889, in a St. Louis weekly, gave her views on the use of alcoholic drinks. She was a member of the Baptist Church. Her husband was a Baptist and deacon in that church. The \\"Leaves from the Deacon's Wife's Scrap Book,\\" which was well received by the public, were original and humorously written sketches from her daily life. She strongly favored woman's advancement and was a stanch advocate of the Temperance Movement. Judge Ray was a lawyer and real estate agent with extensive business, and Ray was his secretary. She wrote daily at a desk in his office, and in his absence had the entire charge of his business. Ray edited three Woman's Christian Temperance Union columns each week in the papers of her own city. Personal life Rachel Beasley married Edwin Ruthven Ray (1828-1915), of Hickman county, on October 10, 1878. In the summer of 1880 Ray had an attack of rheumatic lever, from which her recovery was so slow that a change of climate became necessary, and her husband took her to Eureka Springs, a health resort in Arkansas. There she improved sufficiently in a short time to resume her usual duties, and the family settled there permanently. Ray died on June 27, 1915, and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Tampa, with her husband.

It is located in the Zastler Loch northwest of the Feldberg summit, the highest peak in the Black Forest and state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Location  The Zastler Hut stands in the middle of the Feldberg Nature Reserve below an ice age cirque and below the summit of the Feldberg. Immediately next to a nature trail, it is a popular starting point and destination for walks in the Feldberg region.  History  The Zastler cattle hut was formerly owned by the parish of Zastler, but was taken over by the state in the early 20th century along with the farms in the Zastler valley. Since 1951August Vetter: Feldberg im Schwarzwald, Selbstverlag der Gemeinde Feldberg (Schwarzwald), 1996, p. 433 and 1962 it became once again the property of the then independent parish of Zastler which now belongs to the municipality of Oberried. Since 2001 the hut has been privately owned. In 1883 the herdsman's residence and cattle shed were demolished and a new, larger cattle hut with herdsman's quarters and farming rights was built. In the following years the hut was frequently visited by artists and naturalists from Freiburg, as well as walkers and skiers to whom it was rented in winter. The hut used to be supplied with water from the Zastlerbach. In 1954 three springs were impounded on the Osterrain in order to supply the nearby Freiburger Hut of the Ski-Club Freiburg and the Zastler Hut with drinking water, which was then connected in 1956. Since 1963 both huts have had electricity.Ernst M. Wallner: Zastler, Selbstverlag der Gemeinde Oberried, Ortsteil Zastler, 1991, pp. 123f. After the cattle hut burned down on 12 February 1910, it was rebuilt by the Kirchzarten Forestry Office. The new, larger hut was opened on 12 June 1912. In February 1942 the cattle hut was partially collapsed by an avalanche and became increasingly dilapidated in the years that followed, until it was rebuilt in the early post-war period.August Vetter: Feldberg im Schwarzwald, Selbstverlag der Gemeinde Feldberg (Schwarzwald), 1996, .. 71 In December 2011 the Zastler Hut was cut off from the outside world for six days by a rockslide.Badische Zeitung: Experten sprengen den Weg zur Zastlerh√ºtte frei  Access  During the hut open season (mid May to end October) overnight accommodation is available in a mattress room.

Livestock Marketing Association, 544 U.S. 550 (2005), is a First Amendment case of the Supreme Court of the United States. At issue was whether a beef producer could be compelled to contribute to beef industry advertising.. Facts and prior history Congress charters commodity checkoff programs compelling all producers of certain commodities to contribute to common research and advertising programs. The beef industry is covered by the Beef Promotion and Research Act (1985). Cattle producers disagreeing with the fee and represented by the Livestock Marketing Association sued the Department of Agriculture (USDA) in federal district court. The respondents alleged the government-required fee for advertising was compelled speech and violated their First Amendment right to free speech. The USDA argued the advertising was government speech immune from First Amendment challenge. The district court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had found for the Livestock Marketing Association previously, ruling that the program violated the First Amendment and that the advertising was compelled and not government speech. In a parallel petition (No. 03‚Äì1165), the Nebraska Cattlemen sided with the USDA and sued the Livestock Marketing Association. At the Supreme Court, the two cases were consolidated. Court decision The Supreme Court's decision was announced on May 23, 2005 and delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia. The decision was 6-3 in favor of the USDA's position. Check-offs would continue. Advertising by these industry groups was government speech, therefore there was no infringement of First Amendment rights. Case revisited The case is starting another trip through the courts, starting in Montana with Ranchers- Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Sonny Perdue. The Cattlemen‚Äôs Beef Board (CBB) and USDA oversee the collection and spending of checkoff funds. Additionally, all producers selling cattle or calves, for any reason and regardless of age or sex, must pay $1-per-head. The buyer generally is responsible for collecting $1-per-head from the seller, but both are responsible for seeing that the dollar is collected and paid.

Early life and education  Annie Nicolette Josephus Jitta was born in Amsterdam in 1904. Her Jewish family originated in Bamberg in Bavaria, but moved to Amsterdam in 1812, where her ancestor Nathan Joseph adopted the surname Jitta in response to Louis Bonaparte's edict that all inhabitants of the Low Countries should be registered with a family name. She attended schools in Amsterdam (Meisjeslyceum), Utrecht and The Hague, before taking an art history degree at the University of Leiden. She gained her PhD in 1932 under the supervision of Professor G. A. S. Snijder. It formed the basis for her book Ancestral portraiture in Rome and the art of the last century of the Republic. After taking her first degree exams, Josephus Jitta married Amsterdam-born Jewish lawyer Carel Zadoks. Despite his membership of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, he died in the Amersfoort concentration camp in 1942. Their son Jan Carel spent the war years in Friesland, while Zadoks herself worked at the Colonial Institute of Amsterdam. Her unusual name inspired Dutch journalist Theo Toebosch to research the Josephus Jitta family after seeing it on the cover of her book Antieke cultuur in beeld as a schoolboy many years earlier. Whilst taking his degree in classical languages and archaeology in Amsterdam, he remembers seeing Zadoks walking around on campus, invariably accompanied by her dog. His book about the family, Uitverkoren Zondebokken (Selected Scapegoats), was published in 2010.  Academic career  From 1 May 1948 until 1 January 1963, Zadoks worked as part-time conservator of ancient coins and cut gems at the Koninklijk Penningkabinet, then located in The Hague. She then became a lecturer in classical archaeology at the University of Groningen. Prior to this appointment she had been lector in archaeology for many years, following the retirement of archaeologist G. van Hoorn in 1951 and the departure of his replacement G. H. Beyen soon after. Her initial appointment as a lecturer was for a fixed term of five years, in view of her background as an archaeologist and art historian rather than the more traditional foundation of classical philology. She published ten books and more than two hundred articles, and is credited with changing the face of classical archaeology in the Netherlands. She is also credited with stimulating the still nascent discipline of formal numismatic study in the Netherlands, particularly the work of Wim van Es. Her work inspired the publication of a Festschrift on the occasion of her 70th birthday, with a foreword and praise of Zadoks' work by Elizabeth Visser (1908‚Äì1987), the first female professor of ancient history in the Netherlands.

The film was selected to open the 2018 Cannes Film Festival in competition and was released in Spain on 14 September 2018. It was released in the United States on 8 February 2019. Plot The story follows Laura, a Spanish woman living in Buenos Aires, who returns with her teenage daughter Irene and young son Diego to her small hometown just outside Madrid for her younger sister's wedding. Laura runs into her old friend Paco in the town square while Irene flirts with a local teenage boy named Felipe. After dancing with Felipe at the wedding reception, Irene complains that she does not feel well and goes upstairs to sleep. Later that night, Laura goes to check on Irene only to find she is missing. She receives a text message from kidnappers urging the family to pay a large sum or they will kill Irene. The family decides not to involve the local police for Irene's safety, as the kidnappers will kill Irene if the police get close. Laura receives a text message demanding ‚Ç¨300,000 against the release of her daughter. Chaos ensues as the family scrambles to raise the money. During a heated confrontation with Laura's father Antonio, Paco learns that some family members believe he \\"owes\\" them money, as the land Paco's vineyards were built on was sold to him by Laura at below market rate because he was the child of the family's servants. Laura's brother-in-law, Fernando, calms the situation and brings in his friend Jorge, a retired police officer, for consultation. During a private conversation, Jorge tells Laura that she should include members of her family on her suspect list, including her husband. Desperate to help, Paco considers selling his lands to a business partner so he can pay Irene's ransom but his wife Bea advises against it. She reveals that she has been receiving the same text messages as Laura on her phone. Laura's husband, Alejandro, is informed of the kidnapping and arrives in town. He receives a cold welcome by Laura's family before going with Laura, Paco, and Fernando to meet Jorge, who asks to talk to Alejandro alone. Alejandro becomes very upset when Jorge mentions that Laura discussed his past problems with alcoholism and his ongoing bankruptcy. Enraged by how a stranger knows this information, Alejandro leaves with Laura and they argue about the best course of action. Laura confesses to Paco that Irene is his biological daughter, conceived sixteen years prior during Laura's trip to her hometown shortly after she and Alejandro married. Shocked by this information, Paco readies to sell his estate, but Bea angrily refutes Laura's claim. She believes Laura is lying about Irene's paternity and might be involved in the kidnapping herself in order to get money out of Paco. He leaves the house anyway and comes back hours later with a duffel bag containing the ransom money. After examining Irene's upstairs room, Jorge tells Alejandro and Laura that whoever kidnapped Irene knew that Paco was her father. During a conversation with Fernando, Alejandro learns that the whole family, along with some of the townsfolk, know that Irene is not his biological daughter because of her resemblance to Paco. That night, Laura's niece Roc√≠o sneaks out of the house and travels to an abandoned, run-down building on the outskirts of the town. Once there, she meets with her estranged husband Gabriel and his accomplice Luis. It is revealed that all three of them orchestrated Irene's kidnapping and that Gabriel has been sending the ransom messages to Laura. Luis admits that he is the one who has been sending the same ransom messages to Bea, unbeknownst to Gabriel. This angers Gabriel and prompts a crying Roc√≠o to beg for her husband to let Irene go; their collective actions have deviated too far from the original plan and caused irreparable damage. Despite Luis's protests, Gabriel agrees to let Irene go at dawn. Roc√≠o returns home and is questioned by her mother Mariana, Laura's older sister, as to her whereabouts. Roc√≠o brushes her mother off, leaving Mariana suspicious. At dawn, Paco receives a voice recording of Irene begging for her rescue and a text message of where to perform the exchange. He grabs the duffel bag and drives to the destination. Once he arrives, Paco gets out of his car and rushes to inspect a loud noise made by something large being tossed into a nearby river. When he returns to his car, he finds Irene tied up in the backseat and the bag missing. He delivers Irene to Laura and Alejandro, who rush Irene to a hospital. Exhausted, Paco returns home, only to find that Bea has left him. Shortly afterwards, Laura and her family pack their belongings and say goodbye to the family as they will be returning to Argentina. Felipe promises to call Irene when she gets home. In the car, Irene asks Alejandro why it was Paco who rescued her. He does not answer. As the car drives off, Mariana sits by herself in the town square. She calls over her husband, Fernando, and asks him to sit down. As the two begin to converse, the screen fades to white.

Description Female Adult males of this species have long narrow wings while adult females are flightless. The body of the male is dark brownish- black with a slight yellowish tinge, especially near the joints of the limbs. In the male, the head is paler than the rest of the body, which differentiates it from the otherwise similar Oligotoma nigra. The female is chocolate-brown and the nymphs are much paler, being yellowish-brown. The females and nymphs are difficult to distinguish from those of O. nigra, so they are best identified by association with the male. Like other members of the order, the tarsi of the front pair of legs are enlarged and equipped with about one hundred silk glands. Distribution O. saundersii originated in southern Asia but has spread around the tropics as a result of human activities. It was introduced into the United States, and its range there now extends from Texas to Florida. Ecology Larva Like other species of webspinner, O. saundersii is very inconspicuous, living as it does in a silken tube that it weaves which is hidden away in a crevice or under the bark of a tree, or other similar humid location. Researchers established a colony in the laboratory by placing two adult females and some eggs in a container with large flakes of bark behind which they could hide. The insects were supplied with dry goldfish food. Silken tubes were woven by the females after they had settled down, but the insects remained largely hidden, emerging only at night to feed. A male was seen some time later, indicating that the period to maturity was about four months. He produced his own longer tubes on the walls of the container, often remaining half out of the mouth of his gallery during the day, and sometimes venturing forth. The male did not feed, as is normal in this group, and lived for a few weeks. The eggs were laid in the tunnels and disguised within minutes by chewed bits of substrate so that they resembled the frass and substrate particles already adhering to the webbing; the eggs were not guarded by the female but the camouflage may have prevented cannibalism. The next batch of larvae was seen some two months after the male was observed. Before this, the galleries had been expanded, seemingly in anticipation of the larvae hatching. Further expansion of the colony followed.

He attended Coll√®ge de la Sagesse, a French international school in Beirut, where he developed a love of math and physics that inclined him toward engineering. But an encounter with a medical student sparked his interest in medicine, and he graduated from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1975 with high distinction in Biology and Chemistry. He met his future wife, Huda, at the AUB Faculty of Medicine, as they were both beginning their medical school education. By the end of their first academic year, the Lebanese Civil War had broken out. Huda's parents sent her to visit relatives in the United States for safety while William returned to his family home in Ghazir, a small city just north of Beirut, safe from the war. The political situation deteriorated, however, and the borders closed, stranding Huda in the US. She was accepted to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. William completed his second year of medical school at AUB amidst the bombing and transferred to Meharry the following year.

The pass system was enforced to ensure control over the Black and Coloured women providing domestic services in what was then one of the Boer Republics, namely the Orange Free StateGrisim, R. 2013. South African Bantu women win anti-pass campaign in Orange Free State, 1912-1918. Global Nonviolent Action Database. Accessed 20 July 2017. Background The discovery of minerals in Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal gave rise to economic development and necessitated the construction of a railway line between Bloemfontein and the Transvaal.Gasa, N. 2006. Let them build more gaols. Gasa, N. (ed.), 2007. Women in South African history. pp 55-63. Cape Town: HSRC Press; Veeran. The British takeover from Boer leadership between 1848 and 1854 led to Bloemfontein becoming an administrative, commercial and legal hub. This development attracted a community of skilled and semi-skilled Black people, Coloureds and Indian South Africans as workers, professionals and farm labourers. Government records at the time refer to the people of colour who settled in the city as ‚ÄúBastard,‚Äù ‚ÄúBushmen,‚Äù ‚ÄúFingo,‚Äù ‚ÄúGriqua‚Äù and ‚ÄúHottentot,‚Äù among other derogatory terms. Among the women who settled in Bloemfontein during this period were professionals and domestic workers, who were the wives of middle class men. Many of the people of colour came from Thaba 'Nchu, Lesotho and were Tswana people with heterogenous backgrounds and historical ties to the area. Initially, there was no distinction between Black and Coloured people in Bloemfontein and they lived in the same areas unlike in other parts of the country, like in the Colony of Natal and the Cape. These demographic groups were considered Black then. Waaihoek, a location for Black people, just outside the town, emerged to accommodate the growing Black population and to move Black people away from the railway line, where many had become squatters. The establishment of Waaihoek led to the implementation of formal regulations, restricting the settlement of Black people to this area in 1891, away from where the white population lived. The Black population still provided services in the form of skilled and unskilled labour for the main town's growing economy. Restrictions and regulations By the early 1900s, the law required every Black male person, including school learners above the age of 16, to carry a service book which documented their employer and place of residence. The Orange Free State was the first territory in South Africa to implement pass laws for women. In order to live and work in the city, even in the location of Waaihoek, this document had to be renewed monthly at a fee. Many women who did not live in urban areas or were not employed on a full-time basis as domestic workers did white people's laundry for income. They often travelled to their townships with laundry from parts of Bloemfontein which were assigned to white people. Health authorities eventually traced cases of diphtheria, scarlet and typhoid fever to the laundry done in unhygienic conditions in the township. In 1906, the Bloemfontein municipality built public laundry houses in town with sinks, steam rooms and ironing facilities. These Black women were then prohibited from taking white people's laundry to the location and subjected to permit fees, which allowed them to use the public laundry facilities. The pass laws and permits that were mostly introduced by the municipality put financial strain on women of colour. In the same year, the Union Of South Africa government published new rules for the enforcing the passes and police were given instructions of how to enforce the regulations. By October 1906 the effects of enforcing the residential pass were being felt in areas like Waaihoek. White farmers also pushed for more stringent measures to control black people. As a result, a new pass law aimed at black people in rural areas was put in force. In 1907, a new law was passed in Bloemfontein requiring domestic servants to carry a service book where details on their employment were written. These books were to be carried at all times and produced when demanded. Any person found without the book more than three times would be banished from the city. In 1908, a special Native Administration commission was established to investigate labour needs. Organisations African National Congress Flag Under the organisation's constitution, women were not allowed to participate as full members of the South African Native National Convention (SANNC), now known as the African National Congress (ANC), when it was founded in 1912. As auxiliary members, they had no voting rights but participated collectively. This led to the formal launch of the Bantu Women's League under the leadership of Charlotte Maxeke in 1913.Myakayaka-Manzini, M. 2003. ‚ÄúPolitical Party Quotas in South Africa‚Äù in The Implementation of Quotas: African Experiences. International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Accessed 20 July 2017. The organisation, which mainly consisted of educated middle-class Black women, was established to challenge the pass laws that had been controlling the movement of Black women in the province. The Orange Free State Native, Coloured Women's Association (led by Catharina Symmons and Katie Louw)History of Women‚Äôs struggle in South Africa. 2013. South African History Online. Accessed 20 July 2017. and the African People's Organisation (a predominately Coloured organisation based in the Western Cape) were also among the organisations who actively fought against the racial restrictions. Resistance Louis Botha Cecilia Makiwane When Black political figures repeatedly appealed to the Orange Free State authorities to abolish the pass laws, in vain, the women began approaching the higher offices of the national government. Once they had collected 5 000 women's signatures for a petition, in March 1912 the women's league handed the petition to Louis Botha who was then Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. After the prime minister read their demands, six women presented their case in Cape Town to the Minister of Finance (heading the Native Affairs portfolio) Henry Burton in April 1912.Meintjes, S. 1996. The women‚Äôs struggle for equality during South Africa‚Äôs transition to Democracy. Transformation: Durban. pp 47-65. Accessed 20 July 2017. The Minister is believed to have assured them that action would take place but, after another year, the women's requests still went largely ignored. On 28 May 1913, the league met in Waaihoek to discuss the next steps and concluded that they would practise civil disobedience and no longer carry passes. On that day 200 women led by Charlotte Maxeke marched on the Bloemfontein Mayor's office, and were still unsuccessful in their appeal. Cecilia Makiwane was among them. The following day, on 29 May 1913, hundreds of women marched into town and destroyed their passes by ripping them and burning them in public. 80 women were arrested over the next two days. Protests also broke out in areas like Jagersfontein, Fauresmith, Winburg and across Bloemfontein, where hundreds more people were arrested. In Winburg a group of white women implemented a march to illustrate their support for the non-white women and their cause. Outcome Despite pressure applied by the women against in 1913, the Union of South Africa's government refused to remove them. The campaign gained national media coverage in 1913 when they first began to receive greater support for their campaign. The coverage won the sympathy of the Union government officials in Cape Town. Throughout the Orange Free State, blue ribbons were a symbol of participation and support of the anti-pass campaign. On 27 January 1914 the Executive Committee of the Orange Free State Native and Coloured Women's Association sent a petition to Governor General Gladstone. Women pleaded with him to persuade the Prime Minister and Minister of Native Affairs to relax the pass laws. As a result, on 3 March 1914 the Prime Minister proposed that all pass laws should be looked into. Members of Parliament from the Orange Free State supported a strict enforcing of the pass laws while some from the Cape disagreed. The Women's petition was tabled for discussion in parliament on 29 May 1914. However, by mid 1914 the campaign began to lose momentum and eventually ended. Legacy The 1913 Bloemfontein anti-pass campaign is seen as the inspiration behind the anti-pass campaigns such as the 1956 Women's March and the ANC's 1952 Defiance Campaign. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 1913 anti-pass campaign, the Free State ANC Women's League marched in Bloemfontein on 28 May 2013.

Perhaps these peripheries are deep-rooted centres of knowledge which could guide us towards a more sustainable, conscious and spiritually anchored future, if continued. In exploring these ecologies through art, the biennial asks how non-anthropocentric positions and holistic knowledge systems can provide foundations upon which we can move forward. How can these alternative systems and positions be brought into new contexts, inspire processes of innovation, and be engaged in through art?

Location  The biennial is located in Stavanger, Norway. The particular context of Stavanger plays a significant conceptual role for the Screen City program. Stavanger is a harbour city placed in Southwest Norway with approx. 250,000 inhabitants. The city's rapid population growth in the late twentieth century was primarily a result of Norway's booming offshore oil industry, which remains a key industry in the Stavanger region and the city. The contrast between an old fishing and canning industry and the modern oil-related economy is highly marked in the city's landscape. Stavanger is currently undergoing rapid city development, mostly driven by the wealth from the oil industry. Like most places facing rapid growth, it meets challenges of gentrification and conflicts of interests. Hosting the Nordic Edge Expo in 2017, technology becomes the connecting channel through which artists and audiences can contemplate the consequences of Stavanger's rapid transformations. Screen City has presented art in public space in various districts of Stavanger, in 2013 and 2015 mainly in the city's East end, what used to be a working class neighborhood, and in 2017 along the harbour of Stavanger ‚Äì V√•gen.  Themes  * Migrating Stories (2017): Under the title Migrating Stories, the 2017 Biennial presents expanded moving image artworks from a broad international range of artists dealing with current complexities relating to migration. Artworks reflect upon journeys, diaspora and post-colonialism, transformation of place, and ‚Äòalien‚Äô realities. The theme takes contemporary conditions of movement as its thematic framework for examining the complex forms of transition in all its guises ‚Äì from one place to another, from one state to another, from one memory to another, and from one perceptual state to another ‚Äì as a general narrative to describe our human, cultural and communicative existence today. * Shaping Public Space - Moving Cityscapes (2013): The theme explores different perspectives on how to construct and de-construct the city. It compares the spatial practice of everyday life with the representations of space, how we perceive our city and how we conceptualise it, speaking to changing visions for the urban context of Stavanger. * Labour and the City - In Between (2013): The theme considers how a post-industrial climate has left us with conflicting definitionsl of labour, exploitation of labour and an unknown economic future, and how these industrial changes affect a city's architectonic and social spaces.

The fairness doctrine of 1949 allowed station licensees to editorialize, provided that more than one perspective was included in their overall programming. This was a departure from prior policy under the Mayflower doctrine, which did not allow any editorial content. The Zapple doctrine pertained to a particular sort of political speech situation, when a candidate or his supporters buy air time to support the candidate, or criticize his opponent, but the candidate himself does not actually appear in the broadcast. History The FCC's political broadcasting rules require that equal time be offered to political candidates. The equal-time rule only applied to the candidate, not to the candidate's supporters or spokespeople though. In May 1970, Senate Commerce Committee counsel Nicholas Zapple argued to the FCC that the fairness doctrine was applicable to air time provided by a broadcast station to a political candidate's spokesperson or supporters. In other words, if one candidate's supporters were allowed to buy air time, then representatives and supporters of opposing candidates should have the opportunity to buy a comparable amount of air time. Similarly, if one candidate was given free coverage by a broadcaster, then that broadcaster should be required to offer free coverage to the opposing candidate too. After careful consideration, the FCC responded to Nicholas Zapple by ruling that all similar parties must have quasi-equal opportunity, i.e. they should be treated similarly. This decision became known as the Zapple ruling, and eventually, the Zapple doctrine. Under the terms of Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934, 23 FCC 2d 707 (1970), the Zapple Doctrine applied to purchasing of broadcast time by major political party candidates only. Demise of the fairness doctrine By 1985, the FCC was concerned that the fairness doctrine might actually have a chilling effect, which was the very opposite of the policy's original intent of encouraging fair and balanced coverage: \\"In order to avoid the requirement to go out and find contrasting viewpoints on every issue raised in a story, some journalists simply avoided any coverage of some controversial issues.\\" In addition, journalists felt that it infringed on their rights of free speech/free press under the First Amendment. In August 1985, the FCC decided to suspend the fairness doctrine (it was an FCC policy but not mandated by Congress). Zapple Doctrine 1985‚Äì2014 Although the Fairness Doctrine was suspended, the Zapple doctrine remained extant as an FCC ruling for the next two decades. =Wisconsin election complaint= On May 8, 2014, the FCC was asked to respond to a political programming complaint, made against a broadcast licensee, Capstar TX LLC by supporters of Tom Barrett, the Democratic candidate for Governor of Wisconsin. The Barrett supporters alleged that Capstar would not give them any free airtime on its radio station WISN (AM), in order to respond to statements previously aired on WISN in support of Scott Walker, the Republican candidate for office in the 2012 election. Walker's supporters had received free air time from WISN and affiliate WTMJ (AM) for political campaigning purposes. Barrett supporters based their complaint on WISN's violation of the Zapple doctrine. The FCC acknowledged that WISN had refused to provide air time to Barrett campaign supporters, in violation of the Zapple doctrine. However, the FCC ruled that there was no violation of the law: \\"Given the fact that the Zapple Doctrine was based on an interpretation of the fairness doctrine, which has no current legal effect, we conclude that the Zapple Doctrine similarly has no current legal effect.\\" =Unenforcable= In re: Capstar TX LLC was the catalyst for the FCC's decision that the Zapple doctrine was unenforcable. > The agency [FCC] tasked with protecting the public interest in broadcasting > has decided that WISN and WTMJ, two publicly-licensed radio stations in > Milwaukee, were allowed to give away all the free time they wanted to the > supporters of one candidate (in this case, Gov.

Early life Kashani was born in Petah Tikva to an impoverished Persian-Jewish family with 4 brothers and 3 sisters. In his youth he was a part of the Maccabi movement, and he worked in a factory at age 13. On August 23rd, 1944, Kashani was arrested by the British on suspicions of belonging to the Irgun and sent to Latrun. He was eventually relocated to Eritrea alongside 250 other Jewish prisoners. While in Africa, Kashani insisted on joining the Underground, although at first they would not accept him for being in detention. While in Eritrea, he learned English fluently. When he returned to Palestine, he became a prominent fighter for the Irgun Zvai Leumi, despite the risk of being reported to the British police for being a suspect. Activity in the Underground In the Underground he dealt with intelligence, weapons, and military operations. He even began a course to become a commander, however he died before he could finish. On December 29, 1946, Kashani and four other Irgun fighters, Mordechai Alkahi, Yehiel Dresner, Haim Gilad and Avraham Mizrahi, set out for action on what would be known as the Night of the Beatings. At the Tayyasim Junction, the five of them encountered a police roadblock from which they opened fire. The driver, Mizrahi, died of his wounds. Eliezer and the three remaining fighters were caught and transferred to a nearby military camp, where they went through a series of torture. For 20 hours straight they were beaten. After five days in which they were humiliated and beaten, the fighters were transferred to Jerusalem. Trial and Execution On February 10th, 1947, the four military trials were held. Alkahi, Kashani, Dresner, and Gilad wore khaki trousers and socks, black shoes, a grey coat, and blue-white skullcaps. The four denied the court's authority to try them and refused to respond to questions or accusations. After a short trial, the judges announced that the four were found guilty of carrying weapons. The punishment for Alkahi, Dresner and Kashani was death, while Gilad, 17, was sentenced to life in prison. Just as the verdict was heard, the four rose up and sung Hatikvah. There was hope in the Yishuv to rescue the three, who were not accused of bloodshed, but for holding weapons. In the Jerusalem prison, Kashani was sick, but refused to seek medical treatment as long as he was shackled in his cell. His family's pleas for a pardon were also rejected. His lawyer, who also handled his return from Eritrea, pleaded with him to sign a plea for clemency, however Kashani said he did not recognize English rule and therefore would not sign any paper. On April 15th, the four convicts were secretly transferred from Jerusalem to the Acre Prison. The next day, April 16th, 1947, at 4 AM, the four were brought to the gallows without prior warning, and without notifying their families. At the same time, the authorities hinted that their execution was not imminent, and several hours earlier, attorney Max Seligman, who handled their pardons was informed that there were no preparations yet for the executions. They sung Hatikvah as they were brought to the gallows. Kashani was the last of the four to be hung. The bodies of the four men were led by a convoy of tanks and armored cars to the city of Safed, without informing the Chevra kadisha or their family members, and they were placed half naked in the Mount Canaan police station. Their last request, to be buried in Rosh Pinna, was not honored. At seven in the morning, the radio announced the executions, and a curfew was imposed in Palestine. In the morning, the people of Safed asked to take part in the cemetery, but this city too was under curfew. Nevertheless, hundreds of Jews arrived in the pouring rain to the cemetery, where the Jews of the gallows were buried next to the victims of the 1929 and 1936 riots. There was a great shock in the Yishuv over the hangings, and condemnation was voiced by many Jewish communities across the world. Some American priests even organized memorial assemblies. Months later, British guards were still placed at the graves in Safed so that the Irgun fighters would not remove the bodies and relocate them to Rosh Pinna, as they had requested. Legacy Streets were named after Kashani in several Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, Beersheba, Jaffa and Jerusalem.

The house is Grade II* listed. History The Monmouthshire writer and artist Fred Hando, recording a visit to the Old Cottage made in the 1960s, notes a plaque above the door giving a construction date of \\"C 1600\\". The architectural historian John Newman gives tentative support to this date. The settlement of Treadam was \\"a sizeable medieval hamlet\\" and Hando suggests that it was the domain of one Adam, Tre-Adam meaning \\"the homestead of Adam\\", recorded as reeve to the Lordship of White Castle in 1256-57. The small group of buildings of which the Old Cottage is a part are all that remains of this medieval settlement. In the 19th century, when it formed part of the estate of Llantilio Court, the cottage was extended and converted to two dwellings. In the 20th century, it was converted back into a single home and an extension added to the rear. It remains a private house. Architecture and description Fox and Raglan produced a sketch plan of the cottage in the second volume of their three- volume series Monmouthshire Houses. This shows the original two-room lay-out of the cottage. The cottage is constructed of Old Red Sandstone slabs, with a slate roof. The large, centrally-placed, gable dates from the 17th century. The left-hand of the two doors in the main facade dates from the 19th century conversion into two dwellings. Internally, Hando records the \\"imposing oaken screen of studs and panels\\" which separate the ground floor into two apartments. Cadw records the Elizabethan mullion windows. Newman notes that the original house did not have an upper storey, \\"only a habitable roof space\\".

Its Unicorn-1 platform is a 1P picosatellite, and is about the size of a can of Irn-Bru, while its slightly larger Unicorn-2 platform is a 2P satellite that is about the size of a bottle of the same Launches Alba Orbital is a launch broker , and in the last year it has announced partnerships with several space companies, including Vector and Rocket Lab, in order to send PocketQube satellites into space. These launches harbor clusters containing space for PocketQubes that is sold to teams wanting to send a pod along. The first launch had room for 6P worth of PocketQubes, and the second launch will have room for 12P. There are three launches planned for 2020 and onward, with partnerships and pod owners not yet known. The first of these future launches will have room for 18P, while the final two will have room for 96P. All Alba Orbital launches use Albapod deployers in order to release the clusters. These deployers come in two sizes: 6P and 96P. Due to demand for pod space, Alba Orbital has a waiting list. If demand is high enough, launches will increase in size in order to account for those on the waiting list. The first launch that Alba Orbital brokered took place 6 December 2019 by an Electron rocket. The launch orbited the Alba Cluster 2 of six PocketQubes.

Historian Martin Rheinheimer proposes that she was the daughter of either Elinand (who was Prince of Galilee between about 1144 and 1148), or of Radulf of Issy (who was a nephew of William I of Bures, Prince of Galilee). Historian Hans Eberhard Mayer refutes Rheinheimer's view, saying that William I of Bures and his second wife, Ermengarde of Ibelin, were Eschiva's parents. If Mayer is right, Eschiva must have been born after William and Ermengarde married around 1135. Marriages Eschiva was given in marriage to Walter of Saint Omer who was first mentioned as Prince of Galilee in March 1159. Mayer proposes that Baldwin III of Jerusalem arranged the marriage because he wanted to merge the concurring claims of the Bures and Saint-Omer families to Galilee. Holding the largest fief in the kingdom, the princes of Galilee were to send 100 knights to the royal army. Walter died in early 1174. The widowed Eschiva soon married to Raymond III of Tripoli.

Early life and education  Einstein was born in New York City, US. As her father was a member of the U.S. Air Force, her family moved between New York City, Texas and Massachusetts. She completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in the History of Art at Harvard University. Einstein then earned her PhD in 1984, working on neuroanatomy at the University of Pennsylvania.  Research and career  Einstein joined Duke University in 1989 as an assistant professor and moved to the Centre for Research on Women's Health at Women's College Hospital in 2004. In 2006, Einstein established the University of Toronto‚Äôs Collaborative Graduate Program in Women's Health (now known as the Collaborative Specialization in Women's Health). This program is based at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and is affiliated with the Women's College Research Institute (based at the Women's College Hospital). Einstein led the program as a Director from 2006 to 2016. In 2007, Einstein edited Sex and the Brain for MIT Press. Einstein's work is focussed on women's health, specifically, the anatomy of the female brain. With 72% of Canadian Alzheimer's sufferers being represented by women, Einstein explores why brain disorders like Alzheimer's disproportionately affect women. Einstein's research looks at the relationship between early menopause and decreased estrogen levels, and how this may negatively affect cognition. Further to the differences that gender may play on the human brain, Einstein further posits that the social and cultural context that accompanies being female or male can also have a significant effect on our biology. Einstein has been outspoken on the subject of gender disparity in clinical health research. She participated in the scientific discussion that led to the US National Institutes of Health to form policies requiring even gender distribution in cell and animal studies. In 2016, Einstein was awarded the inaugural Wilfred and Joyce Posluns Chair in Women's Brain Health and Aging. This chair is supported through the Wilfred Posluns' Family Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Alzheimer Society of Canada, and the Ontario Brain Institute.

Leaving in the Disruption of 1843 he also served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1852. Life He was the son of Duncan Makellar, a farmer in Argyleshire. He was born in Kilmichael on 22 June 1780. He studied divinity at Glasgow University and was licensed to preach in 1810. He was ordained as a minister in 1812 and began as minister of Carmunnock From 1814 he was minister of Pencaitland in East Lothian east of Edinburgh. He left the Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843 and moved to Edinburgh hoping to find a church to minister. From 1844 he was living at 8 Walker Street in the West End.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1846-7 Although he never served as a minister for the Free Church he was elected their Moderator in 1852. Ironiocally his son Rev William Makellar laid first claim top the Free Church in Pencaitland and effectively usurped his father in this role. As his father was 63 years old this was not a great concern. On the death of his father-in- law (around 1850) he inherited the Hampden and Kerr sugar plantations in Jamaica. The estate was (and is) a major producer of rum. He also inherited his wife's family home at 8 Charlotte Square one of the most prestigious addresses in Edinburgh and the family lived there thereafter. Although listed in some documents as a \\"slave owner\\" this is inaccurate as Britain had abolished slavery in its colonies at the time of his inheritance. He died at home in Charlotte Square on 10 May 1859 and is buried with his family in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The grave lies at the extreme western end of the concealed southern terrace. Family In 1814 he was married to Helen Stirling (1783-1859) daughter of William Stirling of Pentcaitland (born at 8 Charlotte Square in Edinburgh). He was father to Rev Dr William Makellar (1816-1896). They were also parents to Dr John Archibald Makellar and Jane Anne Makellar.

It runs from Leipzig via Bad Lausick to Geithain. It is part of a long-distance railway from Leipzig to Chemnitz. The line is not electrified and is essentially single track. The only section of double-track is an about 900 m-long section between the Leipzig-Paunsdorf crossover and Leipzig Werkst√§ttenstra√üe.  History Leipzig had a railway connection since the end of the 1830s and Chemnitz was connected to the railway network at the beginning of the 1850s, but a long detour via Riesa was necessary for traffic running between the two cities. Therefore, in the 1850s, the first railway committees were formed, calling for the construction of a line from Leipzig to Chemnitz. In addition to the industrial Mulde valley, other towns such as Borna, Burgst√§dt, Lausigk (Bad Lausick) and Limbach would have benefited from the line. Each committee presented its own proposal for a route, which would have benefited its own location as much as possible. As the Borsdorf‚ÄìGrimma section of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway was opened in 1866, a railway connection to the area south of Leipzig became more and more urgent as many companies moved their production to the new line. The Leipzig‚ÄìLausigk‚ÄìRochlitz stagecoach service had also been closed. That led to vehement demands for a Leipzig‚ÄìGeithain‚ÄìChemnitz railway. However, the Saxon government showed little interest in this new rail connection, while the city of Borna built a short branch line to the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway at its own expense. This line was opened in 1867. The Kieritzsch‚ÄìBorna line was extended to Chemnitz in 1872, but also proposed direct Leipzig‚ÄìChemnitz connections from Leipzig via Lausigk and/or Grimma were not implemented. The opening of the Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway between 1875 and 1877 further delayed the building of a railway through the area around Lausigk. The railway committee of Lausigk did not give up and sent further submissions to the Saxon Landtag (parliament). Of course, the proposal was not very well received at first. On the one hand there were innumerable submissions from all over Saxony. On the other hand, the railway connections to the existing lines through the rather agricultural area around Lausigk were not profitable. The building of the line as a narrow-gauge line was considered, but decisively rejected by the affected area and by the Saxon Finance Minister L√©on√ße von K√∂nneritz. It was only when Chemnitz and Leipzig supported an even shorter link between the two cities, that construction of a railway seemed realistic. The second chamber of the Landtag approved the route in 1883, but it still failed in the first chamber. It was only after a conciliation between the houses that railway construction was approved on 20 March 1884. Initial preparations had begun before the final approval of the construction of the railway. The formal groundbreaking took place on 11 November 1885 in Liebertwolkwitz. The general route ran through level terrain and did not cause any problems for construction, but several very swampy places had to be crossed south of Liebertwolkwitz. The excavation work was carried out mainly by Bohemians and Poles, with the rest carried out by Italians. The long-lasting winter of 1885/86 brought the works to a complete standstill. Some already finished sections of the track were destroyed by heavy rain in the summer of 1886. The police examined the line on 26 April 1887 and no building defects were found. The ceremonial opening was held on 30 April 1887, attended by a large part of the population, and the opening train was hauled by a locomotive of type IIIb. Actual operations commenced on 2 May 1887. In Leipzig, the line ended at the Dresdner Bahnhof (the terminus of the line to Dresden) in 1887, which had been extended for this purpose. With the reconstruction of the Leipzig stations and approaches in 1913, the terminus of the line was moved to the Hauptbahnhof. This resulted in an extension of the line by 270 metres. = Operations= At first, three pairs of trains ran over the line each day, while on Sundays there was a fourth. Platform gates were installed at all stations in 1898. The line developed increasingly as the main line between Chemnitz and Leipzig, because among other things it was around 8 km was shorter than via Kieritzsch. It could also relieve the heavily used Leipzig‚ÄìAltenburg section of the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway. In order to increase capacity, the Leipzig‚ÄìLiebertwolkwitz section was upgraded to two tracks from 1914 onwards. Operations using two tracks commenced in 1916. The construction of a second track to Belgershain at an estimated cost of about 800,000 Marks had already been approved in 1920, but this project was aborted because of a new cost estimates. The line was largely undamaged by the Second World War. After the war, it was initially planned to dismantle the Liebertwolkwitz‚ÄìBad Lausick section of the line for reparations to the Soviet Union. As mining operations had already begun in Liebertwolkwitz, as a short-term measure, the Borna‚ÄìGro√übothen railway was dismantled instead of the Liebertwolkwitz‚ÄìBad Lausick section. The second tracks on the Engelsdorf Werkst√§tten‚ÄìLiebertwolkwitz section was also dismantled in 1946. Since about 1970, many of the mechanical full-barrier level-crossing gates, in particular those on the open line, have been replaced by systems using train-operated half-barriers and stoplights. Most of the approach and several entrance signals were replaced by colour-light signals in the 1980s. In 1990, the tracks consisted entirely of a few sections of continuously welded rail on concrete sleepers. In addition to a pair of goods trains in the 1980s, express and stopping passenger trains ran between Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt and once a day to and from Cranzahl (now in Sehmatal) in the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), as well as a pair of night fast trains (D728/729) to and from Karl-Marx-Stadt‚ÄìRostock. = Since 1990 = Between June 2003 and December 2004, the Leipzig to Chemnitz via Bad Lausick line was modernised to increase the maximum speed to 160 km/h. More than ‚Ç¨100 million were invested. This included the installation of an electronic interlocking of the Alcatel design in Geithain to control the section from M√∂lkau, while the section from Leipzig-Dresdener freight yard to Leipzig Werkst√§ttenstra√üe is now controlled by the Leipzig Ost electronic control centre. The second track between Leipzig Hbf and Leipzig-Paunsdorf was reduced to a crossing loop in the Leipzig- Dresdener freight yard and all connections to the Engelsdorf freight yard and all other facilities previously used for freight transport were dismantled. All level crossing protection systems were replaced by those of the RB√úT type. Since the middle of the 1990s, the track infrastructure has been prepared for an increase in speeds. Missing bridges were also replaced during the track possession, although no consideration was given to restoring two tracks between Leipzig and Liebertwolkwitz.  Outlook After options for upgrading the rail infrastructure between Leipzig and Chemnitz on the Leipzig‚ÄìNeukieritzsch‚ÄìBorna‚ÄìGeithain‚ÄìChemnitz route had been examined several times between 2008 and 2012 and the announcement of the beginning of the preliminary planning for the upgrade of the line via Borna, the state of Saxony and Deutsche Bahn signed a contract for the extension and electrification of the Chemnitz‚ÄìLeipzig line in January 2013. Routes via both Bad Lausick and Borna were to be investigated. As a result of the preliminary investigation, the route via Bad Lausick (and thus the inclusion of the Leipzig‚ÄìGeithain railway) was selected as the preferred option. The main advantages of this option were a travel time of 50 minutes and convenient connections for passengers to the other long-distance lines in Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. In July 2013, the State of Saxony and Deutsche Bahn signed a planning agreement for the further upgrade and the electrification of the Leipzig‚ÄìChemnitz railway. The Free State of Saxony provided funding of around ‚Ç¨2.4 million for this purpose. The preliminary planning was completed in the summer of 2014 and presented to the public in August 2014. In addition to the electrification, the restoration of the second track on the Leipzig‚ÄìGeithain railway is also planned between Leipzig Werkst√§ttenstra√üe and Liebertwolkwitz as well as four selective measures to increase the speed of the line. This includes track laying near Lauterbach-Steinbach station and the accompanying replacement of a level crossing by a road overpass. According to media reports, commissioning is expected at the earliest after eight years. The State of Saxony intends to commission the other projects in a timely manner and to finance them on a pro rata basis. The project was nominated for the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) 2030.  Rail services Trains crossing in Engelsdorf Werkst√§tten in 2000 The only services on the Leipzig‚ÄìGeithain line are passenger services contracted and financed by the Zweckverband f√ºr den Nahverkehrsraum Leipzig (municipal association for local transport in the Leipzig area). With the Regional-Express RE 6 (Chemnitz- Leipzig-Express) (operated since the timetable change in December 2015 by Transdev Regio Ost (eastern region) under the marketing name of Mitteldeutsche Regiobahn (Central German Regional Railway)) there is an hourly, fast train service between Leipzig Hbf, Bad Lausick and Geithain. These trains continue to Chemnitz Hbf. This service is supplemented by stopping trains on the Leipzig‚ÄìBad Lausick route, which are extended to Geithain every two hours (operated since 12 June 2016 by DB Regio S√ºdost, but operated previously for many years by Transdev Regio Ost).  Route description = Course= class 612; long straight sections are typical of the first section of the line to Bad Lausick The starting point of the line is at Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. The line initially runs to the east parallel with the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway. In the suburb of St√ºnz, the line turns to the south. From Liebertwolkwitz, the line runs south-east to Geithain station. = Stations= Leipzig Hbf () After the building of Leipzig Hauptbahnhof from 1902 to 1915, the line now started at the new central station. Previously, the line started at Dresdner Bahnhof (Dresden line station). Leipzig-Liebertwolkwitz station () Entrance building with island platform Leipzig-Liebertwolkwitz (called Liebertwolkwitz until 13 December 2003) was originally the most important intermediate station after Lausigk. Liebertwolkwitz was opened as a halt (Haltestelle) and reclassified as a station on 1 July 1898. Numerous industrial enterprises were located in the immediate vicinity of the station. The station had to be expanded several times. A Kleinlok (small locomotive) was stationed for the extensive freight traffic and a shed was built for it. From 1913 to 1946, the line from Leipzig to Liebertwolkwitz was double track and directional operation (the operation of trains running in different directions on different tracks, in this case on the right) through the station continued until its reconstruction in 2003. Some peak-hour trains ended here and had to make elaborate moves because of the directional operation. The buildings consisted of an entrance building, a goods shed, two mechanical signal boxes of the Bruchsal I design (which controlled, in addition to numerous sets of points, three mechanical full- barrier systems at level crossings), a signal and telecommunication workshop and an official residence. At one time, a Bahnmeisterei (track maintenance supervisor‚Äôs office) was also based there. Freight trains for local delivery and pick-up (√úbergabez√ºgen) also operated from Liebertwolkwitz to the former sidings at Holzhausen (Sachs) station that were closed in 1971. With the political changes of 1989/90, the freight traffic drastically declined and the second track at the station was dismantled in two stages. The \\"Lt\\" and \\"Ls\\" signal boxes were dismantled in 2003 and 2004. Gro√üp√∂√üna () Although the municipality of Gro√üp√∂sna was already campaigning for a station during the construction of the railway, it was only opened on 8 October 1933. Previously, the railway had always directed the locals to Liebertwolkwitz station or later Oberholz. The facilities consist merely of a platform on the ground, which had been prepared for the construction of two tracks, (this was demolished in the 1920s) and a massive waiting room. The railway crossing, which was located directly at the station, has now been replaced by a road underpass slightly further north. Belgershain () Belgershain station was originally opened as a halt, but was reclassified as a station on 1 May 1905. Since numerous surrounding localities used the station, the station had to be expanded by 1900. A loading road, a freight shed and a side ramp were available for freight transport. The two-storey entrance building housed baggage handling and the ticket office as well as the main signal box \\"Bn\\". Guard signal box \\"Bw\\" and a railway residence were also built. In the 1930s, the town, which had only about 700 inhabitants, was served by long-distance services with several express trains passing through the station, which had three mainline tracks. The third mainline track was dismantled after the end of the war. Even today, Belgershain still functions as a station where trains pass, although, in the course of work on the line in the 1990s, all remaining tracks were removed except for the two main tracks. The island platform on the main tracks was demolished with the 2003‚Äì2004 upgrade, thus only every second of the hourly trains could stop at Belgershain station. This unsatisfactory situation was only resolved in 2009 by the construction of a second external platform and a pedestrian bridge. Bad Lausick () At the start of operations, Lausigk station was the most important intermediate station on the railway line after Liebertwolkwitz. Initially equipped with five tracks, the station was soon expanded to cope with the increasing traffic. Lausigk developed into a health resort, as a result of its railway connection, among other things, although, until the end of the First World War, the express trains running along the line did not stop there. As early as the beginning of the 1920s, it was planned to rebuilt the station for the Borna‚ÄìGro√übothen railway. The line was not opened until 1937, but it was dismantled for reparations in 1947. In the 2000s, the still remaining railway tracks were radically rebuilt, leaving only two tracks, but Bad Lausick still serves as a crossing station. Hopfgarten (Sachs) () Hopfgarten station, to the right is the former entrance building, 2012 The station has had four different names during its operating period: * originally: Hopfgarten * until 30 June 1911: Hopfgarten i Sachsen * until 21 December 1933: Hopfgarten (Sa) * since 22 December 1933: Hopfgarten (Sachs) At first Hopfgarten was only a halt, but on 1 May 1905 it was reclassified as a station. Apart from a loading track, there were almost no other facilities at the time. Hopfgarten station was expanded when a crossing loop between Bad Lausick and Geithain became necessary in about 1915 because of increased traffic. After the upgrade, Hopfgarten had three tracks with nine sets of points, an entrance building, a signal box and a freight shed. In addition there was a loading road and a loading ramp. Hopfgarten was reclassified as a halt on 1 June 1987 and all the tracks were dismantled except the main track. The station was already practically unused for freight. Because of the need to control the sequence of trains to make the timetable work effectively, a block post (Blockstelle) was established in Hopfgarten in about 2010. Tautenhain () Like Hopfgarten, Tautenhain was originally only a halt. Tautenhain was reclassified as a station on 1 May 1905, but was again reduced to a halt on 1 September 1933. The only track at the halt is now the main railway line. The entrance building and the goods shed still exist. Geithain () Entrance building of Geithain station, 2011 Originally only a transit station on the Kieritzsch‚ÄìChemnitz line, Geithain station was completely rebuilt before the opening of the Leipzig‚ÄìGeithain railway. In addition, a locomotive depot was built. Geithain also became of great importance in freight transport since large quantities of building materials from nearby brickworks and quarries have been loaded at the station since the end of the 19th century. The present appearance was given to the station from 2002 onwards, as large parts of the station were reconstructed with the upgrade of the Leipzig‚ÄìChemnitz line. The electronic control centre at Geithain, which was built by Thales, has controlled the whole line from M√∂lkau since December 2004 and also the Neukieritzsch‚ÄìChemnitz railway between Frohburg and Wittgensdorf Mitte and the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway between Naunhof and Leisnig, which is part of the central Saxony regional network (Regionalnetz Mittelsachsen).

In antiquity it was part of Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry. Sixteen lines of the poem survive, preserved on a potsherd discovered in Egypt and first published in 1937 by Medea Norsa. It is in the form of a hymn to the goddess Aphrodite, summoning her to appear in a temple in an apple grove. The majority of the poem is made up of an extended description of the sacred grove to which Aphrodite is being summoned. Preservation Before 1937, only two strophes of the poem survived, both quoted in other ancient authors. Hermogenes of Tarsus quotes part of the second strophe in his work Kinds of Style (Peri Ideon), and Athenaeus quotes from the fourth stanza in the Scholars at Dinner (Deipnosophistae). In 1937, the Italian papyrologist Medea Norsa published an ostrakon which preserves four stanzas of the poem. The ostrakon (PSI XIII.1300) was discovered in Egypt, and is now in the collection of the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence. The Florentine ostrakon dates from the mid-third or second century BC, which makes it one of the oldest surviving fragments of Sappho's poetry. The handwriting is good, indicating that it was written by a professional scribe, but the text is full of errors ‚Äì to the point that the Greek does not make sense in places. The ostrakon was most likely either copied by a private enthusiast unfamiliar with the Aeolic dialect used by Sappho, or produced as part of a school exercise. Poem The first book of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poem, from which Sappho 2 comes, was made up of poems composed in Sapphic stanzas. The metre is made up of stanzas of four lines, three longer lines followed by a single shorter line. Four stanzas in this metre survive; it is uncertain whether the poem was originally longer. The Florentine ostrakon begins with a partial line which reads \\"coming down from\\" (\\"œÅŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ∏ŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒπŒøœÖ[\\"). This is generally considered not to have been part of Sappho 2: it is followed by a larger blank space than the other strophe ends on the potsherd, suggesting that it is part of a different text. Additionally, Œ∫Œ±œÑŒπŒøœÖ is not in Sappho's Aeolic dialect, and the most likely restoration of the line is unmetrical for a poem in Sapphic stanzas. The poem is in the form of a hymn to the goddess Aphrodite, invoking her and asking her to appear. In the form which it is preserved on the Florentine ostrakon, it seems to begin unusually abruptly ‚Äì normally such a hymn would begin with a mention of the god being called upon. This may be a deliberate stylistic choice by Sappho, rather than evidence that the poem is incomplete: at least one other archaic hymn ‚Äì Anacreon 12 (Page) ‚Äì also withholds the name of the god being invoked until the final line. Thomas McEvilley argues that Aphrodite's name is withheld in order to build tension. The first three stanzas of the poem consist of an extended description of the sanctuary to which Aphrodite is being summoned. This ekphrasis of a natural scene is unusual in archaic Greek literature. The description makes repeated reference to attributes of Aphrodite: apples, roses, spring flowers, meadows, and horses are all linked to her. Spring flowers are linked to Aphrodite in the Cypria, a poem from the Epic Cycle, where crocuses, hyacinths, violets, roses, narcissi, and lilies adorn her; girls ready for love are described as \\"horses of Aphrodite\\" in Anacreon, and a similar image is found in Theognis. It is generally assumed that the sacred precinct described by Sappho in the poem is a real one which she knew, but there is no evidence for a temple to Aphrodite on Lesbos: McEvilley suggests that the location of the grove should be found in the \\"spiritual geography rather than physical\\". Alexander Turyn compares the sanctuary described by Sappho in fragment 2 to the ancient Greek image of paradise. The description of elysium in Pindar's fragment 129, for instance, has many elements in common with Sappho 2: \\"meadows of red roses\\", \\"frankincense trees\\", \\"god's altars\\" all have parallels in Sappho. However, McEvilley finds equivalent parallels in poems by Xenophanes and Theognis, neither of which describe paradise, and argues that \\"ritual, paradisal, and festal images overlap\\" in archaic Greek poetry, especially by Sappho. Other scholars have seen the description of the grove as a metaphor for female sexuality, such as John J. Winkler and Barbara Goff, who describes the drowsiness induced in it as \\"nothing short of postcoital\\". The final surviving stanza of the poem describes Aphrodite pouring nectar \\"into golden cups\\".Sappho 2.14, trans. This is similar to a ritual described in Sappho 96, and may represent a real ritual in which the priestess, as Aphrodite, poured wine for celebrants. In Athenaeus' Deipnosophistae, a version of the final stanza preserved on the Florentine ostrakon is followed by a line of prose which means \\"for these my friends and yours\\". These words may come from a later stanza of the same poem. As the words are in prose rather than Sappho's Aeolic dialect, and ungrammatical (four words are in the wrong gender) they are not from the poem as Sappho composed it. They are likely to have been composed by Athenaeus himself, rather than known to him from an earlier source; if they had been composed in a Classical Athenian sympotic context, for instance, Mark de Kreij argues that they would have fitted Sappho's metre better. It is possible but not certain that they are a paraphrase of Sappho's work by Athenaeus: at other points in the Deipnosophistae there are similar continuations of quotations which look like paraphrases but in fact do not appear in the source text ‚Äì for instance, in his quotation of Apollonius Rhodius at Deipnosophistae 13.555b.

Education and career W√ºrdtwein's birthplace in Amorbach Plaque marking his birthplace W√ºrdtwein was born in Amorbach, the third son of Ferdinand Kasimir W√ºrdtwein, a civil servant in the Electorate of Mainz, and his wife Magdalene (n√©e Marklein). He attended the school of Amorbach Abbey and then the Jesuit Kronberg-Gymnasium Aschaffenburg. He studied philosophy, theology, and canon law at the University of Heidelberg from 1738 to 1743, while living in the seminary. He attained his bachelor's and master's degrees in philosophy and studied Thomism. Next he studied canon law and dogma at the Catholic seminary in Mainz, and was ordained a priest on 18 July 1745. After serving as a chaplain in Bingen in 1746-1747, he was given a benefice in Werbach. By 1750 he had returned to Mainz, where he studied religious law at the University of Mainz until 1752. He died in Ladenburg. Career in the Electorate of Mainz Exlibris Stephan Alexander W√ºrdtwein W√ºrdtwein served under archbishops Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, Emmerich Joseph von Breidbach zu B√ºrresheim, and Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal, the last prince-elector and archbishop of the old Mainz electorate and of the ancien r√©gime. Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, also from Amorbach, offered W√ºrdtwein a position as tutor to his nephew, Philipp Karl, and then as prebendary at the Stift St. Maria ad Gradus, where from 1762 to 1783 he also served as dean. On the basis of his extensive study of canon law, he was honored in 1758 as geistlicher Rat and given a position on the Vicar general's council, the central power of the electorate. In 1767 he was promoted to the position of Fiskalis maior, a position in which he oversaw religious and moral life and ensured that religious guidelines were followed. In 1770 he became judicial vicar, the highest position in the Electorate besides the vicar general. His expertise was sought particularly in matters of marriage law and church law. In 1783 he became auxiliary bishop and provicar of the Worms diocese, and later that year titular bishop of Heliopolis in Augustamnica. Scholarly work and honors Stephan Alexander W√ºrdtwein in his archive; contemporary engraving by Georg Paul Nussbiegel (1713‚Äì1776) W√ºrdtwein is considered a trailblazer in the source study of ecclesiastical and German history. Because the archives of the Electorate of Mainz were dispersed and partly destroyed, his publications are of great importance to Germania Sacra. He was respected during his lifetime as a scholar and writer during his lifetime, and was recognized by being chosen as an extraordinary member of the Kurpf√§lzische Akademie der Wissenschaften in 1765 (he became an honorary member in 1784), as a member of the Akademie gemeinn√ºtziger Wissenschaften in Erfurt (1776), and as a member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Munich (1781).

He was a member of the Neo-Concrete Movement.  Early life and education  Barsotti was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Barsotti studied drawing under Henrique Vio from 1926‚Äì 1933 at the Colegio Dante Alighieri in S√£o Paulo. In 1934 he began his studies in Industrial Chemistry at the Mackenzie Institute and receiving his degree in 1937.  Career  Upon graduating from the Mackenzie Institute, Barsotti worked as a Chemist until 1939. Barsotti began to work within abstraction around the beginning of the 1940s. In the 1950s Barsotti worked as a textile and theater costume designer. At this time he began to come in contact with artists working within the Concrete Art movement in Brazil. Though Barsotti's work in this period was constructivist in nature, he did not join the Concrete group in S√£o Paulo. He separated himself from the movement in S√£o Paulo by avoiding the strict technicisms that came along with concrete art. In 1953 he created his first truly constructive art. Along with Badia Villat√≥, Barsotti designed the scenography for \\"The Clerk,\\" a mimodrama written by Lu√≠s de Lima in conjunction with Students from the Alfredo Mesquita School of Dramatic Arts for which Willys de Castro wrote the musical score. In 1954 along with his life partner and artist Willys de Castro, Barsotti founded Est√∫dio de Projectos Gr√°ficos, an advertising design consultancy which operated for a decade. Along with de Castro, Barsotti traveled to Europe in 1958 where they studied for one year. During this time in Europe Barsotti met the Swiss artist Max Bill, a leading theorist of concrete art. After returning to S√£o Paulo in 1959 both de Castro and Barsotti joined the Neo-Concrete Movement. Barsotti's first exhibition as part of the Neo-Concrete Movement was at the V Bienal Internacional de Arte de S√£o Paulo in which he was awarded First Prize. Similarly, in 1959 he also participated in the S√£o Paulo Modern Art Salon and won the Grand Gold Medal. In 1960 he participated in \\"Konkrete Kunst\\" an exhibition organized by Max Bill in Zurich. Further exhibitions included Rio de Janeiro in 1960 and S√£o Paulo in 1961. In 1963 along with Willys de Castro, Waldemar Cordeiro, and other artists, Barsotti co-founded the S√£o Paulo based art gallery Associa√ß√£o de Artes Visuais Novas Tend√™ncias which operated for three years. Although Associa√ß√£o de Artes Visuais Novas Tend√™ncias was founded and managed by artists working within the Concrete and Neo-Concrete movements they meant to provide a space and platform for contemporary art to be presented free from the confines of formalities in specific artistic movements. In 1963 Barsotti abandoned his exploration of simple black and white compositions which he had explored earlier in his career and began to experiment with color and its effects on volume and movement.  Artwork  As he started his work as an artist in the 1950s, he drew two-dimensional art that was usually black and white. These drawings used geometric shapes and lines that were mostly mathematical and technical. He exemplified formal elements related to the Neo-Concrete movement. Although technical is his own right, he was not affiliated with the Concretist group, and he created his own forms of art. His areas of expression is what separated him from the Concrete movement into the neo-concrete movement, but since he generally used formal and somewhat rigid geometric lines and shapes, he was considered part of the Neo-Concrete movement. In the 1950s, he created many pieces of art with ink on paper that utilize lines to create aesthetically pleasing angles and space in his artwork. In 1970, he drew Estudos e Formas com los Angulos Cor I, which was drawn with pencil on paper. This includes geometric shapes, specifically what appears to be diagonal squares with lines connecting the top and bottom corners. This artwork came with his slight change in style in the 1960s to use monochromatic planes, which were toned- down with some geometric inflections. Another aspect of change in the 1960s was his exploration of colors with different formats. He started to use various geometric shapes in rhythmic sequences to explore different areas of space in his drawings. As an act to counter the Concrete movement, he used colors that was specifically rejected in the Concrete movement. This was a significant way that many of the Neo-Concrete movement artists used to express themselves uniquely in a way that set them apart from the Concrete movement. Many of Barsotti's later artwork presented as acrylic paint on a shaped canvas. These canvases would be in the form of simple shapes, such as a circle, square or triangle. Each have two shades of the same color with a slit in the middle. These particular paintings were a part of Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros and made in 1996.

View looking E View of the Erlenbacher Hut from the Wilhelmer Tal The Erlenbacher Hut () is an inn and cattle hut (Almh√ºtte) on the Erlenbach stream (about ) in the Black Forest in Germany.  History  For centuries, cattle were kept over the summer near the Erlenbach stream by a grazing co-operative. Since the soils at 1,300 metres above sea level are not suitable for intensive agricultural use, it was primarily young cattle that were grazed. The pasture cooperative appointed a so-called herder who managed the cattle hut. In former times a herdsman, who was responsible for the cattle, assisted him. Today the herder manages the Erlenbacher Hut and looks after the animals. Thanks to well-developed roads and its own mains electricity, the Erlenbacher Hut can be occupied all year round by the herder and his family. The name Erlenbach could refer to a community of alder trees or it could be a person's name such as Erlebrand or Erlebrecht. It is clear from documents that the Erlenbach pasture cooperative already existed around A.D. 1000 or 1100. However, whether they were already using the Erlenbach as a highland pasture is not proven. In the 12th century, the place name \\"Erlibach\\" as a designation for a forest located under the Feldberg, first appeared in a bill of sale. The Erlenbach was sold several times over the course of the centuries, inter alia around 1327 to the Williamites. In 1472, the Erlenbach farm is first mentioned, which at that time consisted of a dwelling house and a stable for the animals of the herder. In subsequent documents, the Erlenbacher Hof is pledged and sold several times. In this case the (usually 12 or 13) members of the Erlenbach Grazing Cooperative (Erlenbacher Weidegenossenschaft) are often named as owners. Since the 17th century an almost unbroken line of herders and innkeepers have occupied the hut. In 1769 a new combined domestic house and cattle hut were built. In the 1960s it was planned to open up the Erlenbach area for ski tourism, but this plan did not come to fruition.  Today  Currently Axel Br√ºstle and his wife, Karin Arens, are the herder and innkeeper at the Erlenbacher Hut, which is still maintained as a grazing cooperative. In summer the family looks after about 120 head of cattle on the Erlenbacher Weide, which covers 80 hectares at a height of between 1,100 and 1,300 metres above sea level.  Access  The Erlenbach is accessible by car from Oberried and is usually used as the starting point for numerous walks in the Feldberg region. It is especially suited as a base for the Alpine Path (Alpiner Pfad), one of the highest trails in the Black Forest, which runs through the Alpine terrain of the northern cliffs of the Feldberg and St√ºbenwasen. The exposed nature and Alpine character of the Alpiner Pfad are unusual for the Black Forest.

Country The Wudjari's traditional lands are estimated to have extended over some , encompassing the southern coastal area from the Gairdner River eastwards, as far as Point Malcolm. The inland extension was to about 30 miles. Kent, Ravensthorpe, Fanny Cove, Esperance, and Cape Arid all have been developed over the old Wudjari lands. Early history There was a western/eastern divide among the Wudjari bands. At the earliest point of contact with white explorers, it was noted that the western divisions were on the move, shifting towards Bremer Bay. The groups to the east of Fanny Cove and the Young River, on the other hand, had adopted circumcision as part of their tribal initiatory rites, a transformation that earned them the name of Bardonjunga/Bardok among those Wudjari who refused to absorb the practice. This customary scission, according to Norman Tindale, perhaps marked the inchoate genesis of a new tribal identity among the easterners, who had also adopted a differential ethnonym for themselves; Nyunga. These Wudjari Njunga contested the terrain between Mount Ragged and Israelite Bay with the Ngadjunmaia. Curiosity In 1855 an edited account was published of a shipwrecked castaway, called William Jackman, purporting to relate 18 months of captivity among Australian cannibal tribes somewhere on the Great Australian Bight. The story proved very popular, and the narrative seen as fascinating, but suspicions have long existed as to its authenticity. In 2002, the historian Martin Gibbs analysed both the book and its historical background and context, and concluded that some elements certainly bore traces of familiarity with the Nyungar cultural block. In particular he conjectured that parts of the tale might well reflect experience of living among the Wudjari, or Nyunga, or even the Ngadjunmaia.

The first widely reported incident was on June 23, 2017: ABP News reported a woman from Bikaner, Rajasthan, had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept. Similar incidents were increasingly reported throughout India, particularly in the northern states of Delhi, Bihar, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Indian-administered Kashmir. India =Rajasthan= On June 23, 2017 ABP News reported a woman from Bikaner, Rajasthan had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept. Additional hair-chopping incidents followed, and fears of an epidemicparticularly in Rajasthansoared. Incidents occurred not only at night but also during the day. Three days before the June 23 event, a similar incident was reported in Pipad City, Jodhpur, where a girl's hair had been found cut when she awoke in the morning. This news was first reported by Dainik Bhaskar. Along with the missing hair, the girl displayed injuries on other parts of her body.[which parts?] When police investigated, they found that the girl's hair had been cut by a blade. However, they were unable to find the culprit. On July 6, 2017 the Hindustan Times reported that two girls from Rajasthan, aged 13 and 14 years old, and both unknown to each other, were victims of additional hair incidents. On July 8, 2017 the BBC reported that many western municipalities including Bikaner, Nagaur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, and Jalore had been affected by these incidents. =Uttar Pradesh= In early August 2017, two cases were reported from Aligarh and Moradabad. Four cases were reported in Bulandshahr. But later Uttar Pradesh (UP) police and Delhi Police clarified that the incidents were only rumours. According to The Indian Express news channel, around thirty cases were filed all over north India. On August 2, a 62-year-old woman was killed by angry villagers in Agra for being accused as a \\"witch\\" who cut the braids of girls. NDTV India reported this news on August 3, 2017. UP police filed murder cases on two suspects who fled the city and were neighbors of the victim. =Delhi= On August 1, 2017 three women, unknown to each other and aged between 50 and 60, from Kangan Heri complained about being the victims of hair-chopping incidents on the same day. None of the women had seen their perpetrator, but when they fell unconscious and later woke up, they found their hair chopped. =Haryana= Fifteen cases were reported in Haryana state. The women who were victims of these types of incidents said that they had witnessed \\"god-men\\", \\"witches\\" and \\"cat-like creatures\\". The police rejected these claims. One such incident happened in Gurgaon on July 28, when a 60-year-old woman found her braid chopped when she awoke on the floor. She made claims that a thin man came to her doorsteps with a trident in his hand. She claims she asked him to leave, but he reappeared, which led her to fall unconscious. The police filed the case and entered it in the Daily Diary. =Jammu and Kashmir= there have been more than 200 incidents of women being attacked and often knocked unconscious by men in balaclavas, who then chop off their traditional hair braids. Officers had no solid leads or suspects, and Kashmiri police had to respond to a surge of revenge attacks by vigilantes armed with knives, cricket bats, and iron rods. The initial police response to the braid attacks, which mainly occurred inside people's homes, was to suggest the victims were suffering from hallucinations. This drew criticism from the government-run Women's Commission, and they began serious investigations but no arrests have been made. Tasleema Bilal, a 40-year-old woman whose hair was cut off in September 2018 while she was in her home in Srinagar, the region's main city, said that she tried to remove the attacker's mask before escaping, leaving her hair behind. Other women have said that they were knocked unconscious with a mysterious chemical spray that authorities have yet to identify. Kashmiris have alleged the attacks are the \\"handiwork of Indian agencies\\" trying to intimidate the portion of Kashmir's population that opposes Indian rule. Residents are also suspicious of the Indian authorities, and some have accused soldiers and police of staging the attacks or protecting those responsible. In many incidents, the police and army appeared to aid the braid choppers in escaping by taking and saving them from public vigilantes.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/24/women- living-fear-braid-chopping-bandits/ On October 22, 2017, Arab News, a Saudi Arabian news agency, reported that around 100 women in Kashmir have been victims of hair-chopping incidents. Religious responses =Hinduism= In the June 23 case, the victim's legs and hands had a Trishula mark, linking the incident to Hinduism. However, no Hindu religious leaders have responded to this detail. =Islam= Some Indian Muslims have also been victims of these types of incidents. Some Islamic scholars stated that these incidents are being executed by mischievous elements in society. Change in the rumor On August 19, a report from Dainik Bhaskar changed the discussion surrounding these events. The report clearly proved that there was no such evidence of a witch or a ghost being responsible. In this report, a man from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh caught an insect which was later suspected to be a dermestidae, drugstore beetle, rain beetle or varied carpet beetle. This insect is believed to feed on keratin found in hair and nails. A similar case occurred on August 9, when a man killed a honey badger accused of eating or chopping women's hair, but due to lack of evidence, this report faced negligence. On August 17, a report from Manpur, Madhya Pradesh had several eyewitnesses. The incident happened around 4 pm as the victim was sitting outside her house. She suddenly felt that her hair was being cut off. Her screaming brought the attention of her grandmother, who saw that her hair was being cut off, but she did not see anyone do it. Her grandmother quickly caught her fallen hair and the cutting stopped. Later the grandmother discovered an unusual detail. She noticed that as she picked up and held the hair, the rest of her granddaughter's hair was sheared, except for the exact number of hairs she held.

Biography Milka Duduniƒá was born in September 1939 in Slabinja, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Croatia), near the modern-day border of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. She met her future husband, Stjepan Mesiƒá, after he had seen her in the jury of a dance competition in Zagreb and had asked his friend to introduce him to her because his friend's girlfriend was Milka's college roommate. The couple married in 1961 after Stjepan had earned a college degree and their first daughter, Sa≈°a, was born soon afterwards. Milka had been studying psychology at the University of Zagreb, but abandoned her studies after the birth of her first daughter and her husband's graduation. The couple moved from Zagreb to Stjepan's native town of Orahovica and Milka gave birth to their second daughter Dunja in 1963. In 1965 Stjepan Mesiƒá became the first popularly elected Member of the Croatian Parliament and thereafter proceeded to become the chairman of the Municipal Assembly of Orahovica and later the municipality's president. Stjepan also gained employment as an assistant to the director of the local community health center in order to provide an income for his wife and daughters. However, following the outbreak of the Croatian Spring and the resulting crackdown by the regime of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito on political opponents, Stjepan Mesiƒá was stripped of his political functions and his job. He refused to immigrate abroad, as many other Croatian Spring supporters at the time had done to avoid further misfortune at the hands of the Yugoslav regime, and instead chose to agree to a trial and was sentenced to a two-year jail term. The Mesiƒá family sued the community health center in Orahovica and the monetary compensation awarded to the family was used to send Milka and her two daughters to Zagreb, where they resided with Stjepan's stopmother Mileva. Milka was able to gain employment at a kindergarten at the mjesna zajednica (a form of local self-government in the former Yugoslavia) of Studentski dom, but she almost lost her job when it was found out that her husband was in prison for activities relating to the Croatian Spring and ultimately retained her job due to the efforts of her colleagues, who shielded her from being branded as holding responsibility for her husband's activities. She later worked at a kindergarten in the Pantovƒçak neighborhood of Zagreb until she went into retirement. After her husband's election as President of Croatia in 2000 she kept a low profile and seldom accompanied him on official trips and state visits abroad. However, she came to public attention in 2010, when it was revealed that she had acquired two apartments in Zagreb (along with the one already owned by the Mesiƒá family) which were together valued at approximately 1.9 million kuna, having purchased them from a company owned by Stjepan Mesiƒá's former presidential campaign manager ≈†tefanija Balog. President Mesiƒá proceeded to explain that the money used to purchase the two apartments was loaned from a friend of theirs, whom he refused to name, and that the money would be paid back when the Mesiƒá family sold its valuable apartment on Ilica street. Several affairs also surfaced later on involving the couple's daughters, Sa≈°a and Dunja, as well as their grandchildren Sara ≈†imunoviƒá and Tomo Mesiƒá Obranoviƒá. Personal life She is married to former Croatian President Stjepan Mesiƒá, who also held a number of other high-ranking political offices in Yugoslavia and Croatia, as well as local-level political offices and a judgeship in his home town of Orahovica. They have two daughters: Sa≈°a (born 1961) and Dunja (born 1963).

Ukrayinska Pravda (Champion). 7 October 2014 Biography Chubenko studied at the Kramatorskoy Secondary School Number 12, and was fond of sports. At first he was engaged in the Greco-Roman wrestling, then he was fond of football, and defended the gates of the youth team \\"Avangard\\" from Kramatorsk, and Donetsk, visited his matches in Donetsk, and traveled with the team to other cities of Ukraine. With friends, he organized a team of KVN, which traveled to perform in different cities of Ukraine. Also, with friends, Stepan took care of a children's home in Kramatorsk. They often visited children, brought them toys, clothes, books, and delicacies. Stepan said to his girlfriend that when they marry, they will have one child and adopt two more. With the onset of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine in 2014, Stepan and his friends took part in rallies in support of the integrity of Ukraine, held in Kramatorsk. The boys brought water, products, and hygiene products for the Ukrainian soldiers who arrived in the city. During the bombing, he helped go downstairs to the elderly, carrying water to them when the city's water supply was cut off. Risking his life, Stepan took out the flag of the DPR from the city square. In April 2014, when Russian militants seized the city, their mother drove Stepan to her parents in Russia, but a month later he returned, declaring that he did not want to hide \\"like a rat\\" in times difficult for the country. In June 2014, Stepan went to a friend in Kyiv. On June 23, he took a train in the capital to return home. He traveled through Donetsk where he was detained by militants from the Kerch battalion, according to reports, for a yellow-blue ribbon on a backpack, and according to Igor Stokoz, a representative of the Donetsk regional military-civilian administration, because he had entered into a dispute with defending the position of a single indivisible country. The bandits began to beat the juvenile boy in Donetsk. Then he was taken to Horbachevo-Mykhailivka, where after terrible torture, he was shot. Immediately after the disappearance of his son, his mother traveled to Donetsk on his wanted list. She was able to find out that the boy was shot and talked with the leader of the republic Alexander Zakharchenko, who said he'd find the body of her son and his killers. At the end of September 2014, the mother came to the news that the body was found. Exhumation happened on October 3, during which, the mother recognized her son. She succeeded in getting him sent to Kramatorsk. On November 8, 2014, Stepan Chubenko was buried in his home town. The killers were three militants from the Kerch battalion - 1969, 1971 and 1984 years of birth. Two of them - residents of Donetsk, one - from Makeevka.

(November 2017) Taxi 5 is a 2018 French action comedy film directed by Franck Gastambide. It is the fifth installment of the series Taxi, but features an entirely different cast.  Plot  Sylvain Maro, inspector of the Paris police, is considered one of the best police officers of the French capital, who dreams of serving in the special forces. After it is found out that he slept with the Commissioner's wife, he is transferred to the municipal police of Marseille, whose mayor is the former Commissioner Gibert. While chasing a taxi driver, he ends up drowning the patrol car and as a result enters into a skirmish with the city police. Gibert informs the team about a \\"gang of Italians\\", who use two powerful Ferrari for committing their crimes, and instructs Maro to arrest them. Due to the local police cars being under-powered, he realizes he won't be able to keep up with a Ferrari. Alain, a colleague of Maro, tells the newcomer about the legendary taxi of Marseille and about the adventures of Daniel and Emilien. But years have passed: the car is now in Morocco, Emilien has left the police, and Daniel lives in Miami. Sylvain and his team find Daniel's nephew, Eddie Makhlouf, who was the taxi driver he was chasing. Sylvain offers Eddie a deal; find his uncle's taxi and he will be set free. Eddie makes a counter-offer, stating that he wishes to be the driver of the taxi when they find it. They find the car, but it turns out that the nephew does not have the talent of his uncle. The next day they begin operation \\"Mafia\\", as named by Gibert. As the thieves are escaping, Gibert makes a mistake leading to a car pile-up, one of the victims of which is revealed to be the Minister he had met previously. Sylvain chases after the thieves but is still unable to keep up with their cars. Realizing that the car needs more modifications he ends up leaving the taxi with Eddie's sister, Samia. Sylvain is immediately smitten by her and tries to make a move but is turned down. He goes with Eddie to meet an \\"Italian\\" Rashid, who informs them about a place where the Italians train - an abandoned racing track. Sylvain and Eddie go there and win the race. One of the robbers, Tony Dog, a former driver for Formula 1, offers Sylvain a job and invites him to a private party. The entire municipal police team is sent there. Eddie, disguised as a waiter, enters Dog's office and finds the plan for the next robbery - the theft of a diamond \\"Cassiopeia\\". He shows Sylvain the evidence, but when they hear someone coming, they try to hide in the room. Both overhear the robbers speaking to two corrupt city cops. Because of Eddie's stupidity they get caught and Eddie ends up revealing everything to one of them. After Sylvain escapes through the window, Eddie is rescued by one of the police officers. On the day of the robbery, the diamond \\"Cassiopeia\\" arrives in Marseille by helicopter. Before it can land, the robbers threaten to blow it up using a stolen military drone. After blowing up a couple of police cars as proof, the pilot is forced to fly the helicopter to a yacht. Sylvain and Eddie chase after the helicopter along with the cops. The corrupt cops are stopped by Eddie' friends while clearing a path for the taxi. The cops commandeer a civilian vehicle but they eventually get stopped by the municipal police while the robbers continue their pursuit of the taxi. After opening fire on the taxi, Sylvain uses the boost to gain more speed and as a result the taxi is sent flying off a cliff and crashing into the back of the yacht where Rashid has already claimed the diamond from the pilot. The gang is then arrested, and the diamond is returned. Sylvain heads over to Samia to tell her about the car when she reveals that it's already over the news. Eddie is shown on television pretending to be a cop while taking credit. He thanks Sylvain and Samia before ending it with a proposal to his girlfriend. In the hospital, Alain, seeing the broken taxi, is upset. Later at a ceremony, everyone involved is awarded. Sylvain arrives in a Lamborghini confiscated from the Italians, followed by Samia in a new car she had been working on. Both then proceed to race to the airport.

Please do not litter\\" Kalasipalyam (also spelled Kalasipalya) is a locality in the central part of Bangalore, Karnataka, India, and one of the older and most congested places in the city. The locality is home to landmarks such as Bangalore Fort and Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace. The area is known for its high traffic congestion and unhygienic conditions of roads. History Kalasipalyam is said to have been created in the latter half of the 18th century during Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan's rule over Bangalore during which period the city was expanded. The expansion to the east of the fort came to be known as Kalasipalyam; kalasi means \\"tent-pitchers and organizers of military camps\\" and palya means an area of land ruled by a chieftain. Transportation system The area has become a transport hub in recent years, with the Kalasipalyam Bus Station serving thousands of intra- city and outstation buses, and an estimated 800,000 passengers per day. Apart from the state-run KSRTC and BMTC buses, hundreds of private buses to southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu originate at the station. The station was said to have been constructed in the 1920s. The bus station is infamous for its garbage dumping, open urinals and muddy ground. In 2016, it was announced that the BMTC would replace the existing bus station, which was plagued by craters and filth, with a new terminal at a cost of 60 crore and ready for operation in two years. In June 2017, the K. R. Market station of Namma Metro's Green Line was opened for operation. The station serves the Kalasipalyam area and was labelled as the \\"gateway to Pete areas\\". Apart from the fort and the palace, the station is surrounded by Bangalore Medical College, Victoria Hospital, Vanivilas Hospital, Minto Eye Hospital, Kalasipalyam Bus Station and K. R. Market. Markets and religious sites Kalasipalyam is also a market hub with K. R. Market located in the area and the Pete area located in close proximity. The locality is said to have been of religious importance to Hindus and Muslims who believed it to be the place where saints walked.

She is considered a pioneer of the Brazilian modernist movement that started in the 1950s, and was the only female member of the concrete art movement based in S√£o Paulo, the Grupo Ruptura.  Early life and education  Lauand was born in Pontal, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In the mid-1950s, Lauand graduated from the Escola de Belas Artes in Araraquara, S√£o Paulo in Brazil with a degree in fine arts. While at Escola de Belas Artes, Lauand's education was based in traditional fine arts. Dom√™nico Lazzarini and Maria Ybarra de Almeida taught her painting and L√≠vio Abramo taught her printmaking.  Career  After graduating from college, Lauand worked as a teacher in Araraquara and produced artwork on the side, which at that time was in the style of expressionist figurative paintings. In 1953, Lauand moved to S√£o Paulo. In 1954, she worked as a gallery monitor at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, which led to her connecting with fellow artists who were part of the concrete art movement, Grupo Ruptura: Anatol W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Geraldo de Barros, Leopoldo Haar, Lothar Charoux, Lu√≠s Sacilotto, Kazmer F√©jer, and Waldemar Cordeiro. Lauand soon joined the group, becoming their only female member. Lauand work is rooted in the abstract art from the 1950s, with a movement in 1954 to a more rigid and analytical approach. Starting in the 1960s, Lauland began incorporating non- traditional materials like paper clips and other items into her pieces, making the surfaces uneven and creating different effects. Lauand was the only artist among her contemporaries who signed her paintings, and signed on the front of the painting. This was seen as a more traditional approach, and was a rejection of the theoretical aesthetic of what other artists were doing. Lauand works across many different mediums. As a painter, she creates works using acrylic, enamel, oil, and tempera paints, incorporating gouaches and/or collages. Lauand's output also takes the form of embroidery, sculptures, woodcuts, and tapestries.

Cadw considers that the current house is likely to have been built by James Hughes, in the early to mid-17th century. Hughes's descendant, also James, was Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1717 and was probably responsible for the 18th century reconstruction. Later in that century, the house was the vicarage for the Reverend William Watkins, vicar of Llangattock Lingoed, Llantilio Pertholey and Llanvihangel Crucorney. The farmhouse remains a private residence. Architecture and description The house was originally two residences, set at right angles. The left-hand block has a cider house attached to it. The house is of sandstone rubble, now rendered, of two storeys and with a slate roof. The interior is \\"exceptionally well-preserved\\" and contains important decorative features from the 17th and 18th centuries, including a \\"highly unusual painted\\" parlour.

This receptor is an important part of the plant immune system as it allows the plant cells to recognize and bind to EF-Tu, preventing genetic transformation and protein synthesis in pathogens such as Agrobacterium.  Background  The plant Arabidopsis thaliana has a genome with only around 135 megabase pairs (Mbp), making it small enough to fully synthesize. It also makes it relatively easy to study, leading to its use as a common model organism in the field of plant genetics. One important use of A. thaliana is in the study of plant immunity. Plant pathogens are able to travel through a plant's vascular system, but plants do not have specific immune cells that can travel this way. Plants also do not have an adaptive immune system, so other forms of immunity are required. One is the use of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) to bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), which are highly-conserved structures on the outside of many invasive organisms. This form of immunity acts on intercellular pathogens, which are ones outside of individual plant cells. PRRs are transmembrane proteins, which have an anchor inside the cell and portions that extend beyond the membrane. They are part of the innate immune system and bind to and prevent the proliferation of pathogens with the PAMPs that they can bind. EF- Tu, a very common and highly conserved protein, is an example of a PAMP that can be found in numerous pathogens. Its function as an elongation factor means that it helps create new proteins during translation in the ribosome. When a protein is being formed, amino acids are connected in a long sequence, known as a protein's primary structure. Elongation factors help coordinate the movement of transfer RNAs (tRNA) and messenger RNAs (mRNA) so they stay aligned as the ribosome translocates along the mRNA chain. Due to its importance in ensuring the accuracy of translation and preventing mutations, EF-Tu is a good target of both immune systems and drug therapies designed to prevent infections and subsequent diseases.  Biological function  = Synthesis = EFR, like other proteins, undergoes translation in a cell's ribosomes. After the primary structure of the protein has been formed it must fold into its three dimensional tertiary structure to become functional. This occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). While in the ER, this primary polypeptide chain undergoes a regulatory process known as ER-quality control (ER-QC) to help ensure it folds into the correct 3-D structure. and avoids. ER-QC process consists of a series of chaperone proteins that help guide the folding of the EFR polypeptide chains, preventing the aggregation of many polypeptide chains into one large group. Proteins that have not folded are kept in the ER until they have folded into their correct 3-D shape. If folding does not occur then the unfolded protein is eventually destroyed. One of the control mechanisms of EFR is the protein Arabidopsis stromal-derived factor-2 (SDF2). A genetic variant of the A. thaliana plant that did not have the gene to encode for this protein had a far lower production of functional EFR proteins. SDF2 also cannot be substituted for other enzymes in EFR production. Experimental analysis indicated that EFR is destroyed in the cell when it is produced without SDF2, though the mechanism of this action is unknown. Other proteins that are required for the proper synthesis of EFR include Arabidopsis CRT3 and UGGT, which are members of the EFR-QC and act as chaperones to help folding. = Role in plant immunity = EFR receptors have a high affinity for the EF-Tu PAMP. This has been proven analytically through competitive binding assays and SDS-PAGE analysis. When EFR binds to EF-Tu, the basal resistance is activated. This response happens after an infection has already been established and it is important to the plant immune system because it prevents the spread of the pathogen throughout the plant. Only bacteria that have a high amount of EF-Tu are effectively inhibited by EFR, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. = Similarities to FLS2 = Like EFR, FLS2 (flagellin-sensing 2) is a plant receptor-like kinase that acts as a PRR in the plant innate immune system. Instead of binding to EF-Tu, it binds to flagellin, another highly conserved structure present on many pathogens. It, like EF-Tu, is a good target for the plant immune system since it is so widespread. It also triggers an immune response in a larger variety of plants than EF-Tu. The immune response triggered by FLS2 is very similar to the one that is triggered by EFR and the enzymes that are activated by both receptors likely come from a common pool that is found in many cells. This indicates that the two receptor pathways converge, which has been shown to occur at the ion channels in the plasma membrane. By perceiving multiple PAMPs, a plant is able to respond to a pathogenic infection more quickly and efficiently, as well as respond to a wider array of pathogens.  Applications  EFR is found only in the plant family Brassicaceae, meaning it has a limited effect in nature. Experiments have demonstrated the ability to successfully transfer EFR to plants in other families, such as Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of tobacco, and Solanum lycopersicum, the tomato plant. The ability to transfer PRRs between plants and have them retain their effectiveness broadens genetic engineering techniques to promote disease resistance in crops. It can also reduce chemical wastes associated with mass agriculture and enable the transfer of immunity rapidly and without traditional breeding.

As one of the founders of the Great Indonesia Movement Party in 2007, he is the party's current vice chairman. A prominent member of the opposition, he is a frequent critic of Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his cabinet. While formally a deputy speaker, Fadli has twice served as acting speaker of the House - in both cases as a replacement for Setya Novanto when the latter resigned due to involvement in corruption scandals. Most recently, Fadli held the post from 11 December 2017 to 15 January 2018. Family and personal life Zon was born in Jakarta, the eldest of three children of Zon Harjo and Ellyda Yatim, both from Minangkabau in West Sumatra. His father died when he was a teenager. From 1989 to 1990, he attended Harlandale High School, San Antonio on an exchange program facilitated by the American Field Service. In 1997, he completed his undergraduate education in Russian Studies at the University of Indonesia. He later studied at London School of Economics and Political Science, earning a masters in development studies. He has established a library in Jakarta, named after himself, and a cultural house in Tanah Datar, West Sumatra. A large fan of the traditional Kris, he possesses a large collection of them and chairs the Indonesian National Kris Secretariat for the 2016-2021 term. He is married to Katherine Grace, and they have two daughters. Career =Early political career= After graduating in 1997, he became a member of the People's Consultative Assembly for two years. After the fall of Suharto, he was one of the founders of Islam-based Crescent Star Party and briefly became one of its chairmen, but he resigned in 2001. Between 1999 and 2007, he was on the boards of directors of several energy and agricultural companies, before he met businessman Hashim Djojohadikusumo in November 2007. Hashim, Zon and Hashim's brother Prabowo Subianto, then a member of Golkar, declared and registered Gerindra in December 2007 and the party participated in the 2009 elections, winning 4.46% of the votes and gaining 26 seats in parliament. Zon himself did not gain a seat, receiving 11,077 votes in West Sumatra electoral district 2, where the seat-winner received 21,348 votes. In the 2014 elections he ran once more for a legislative seat, this time in a West Java electoral district, where he received 79,074 votes, securing himself a seat in the People's Representative Council. =As deputy speaker= After Joko Widodo's victory over Prabowo Subianto in the presidential elections, Gerindra formed an opposition coalition named Koalisi Merah Putih (Red and White Coalition), which held a parliamentary majority, comprising Gerindra, the PKS, the PAN, the PPP, and Golkar. Zon frequently criticized Widodo's policies, from a ban on ministerial-level officials to speak in parliament, an alleged l√®se-majest√© case against a satay seller, to the revocation of national fuel subsidies. In 2015, Zon and House Speaker Setya Novanto caused controversy by attending a press conference in the United States of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The two were accused of receiving graft (in form of Trump campaign accessories, which were seized by the Corruption Eradication Commission) and of misrepresenting the position of the legislative body. The two were later reprimanded for violating the House's code of conduct. Zon was appointed chairman of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption in October 2015, a position he has held since. In December 2015, when Setya Novanto resigned from his position as a speaker upon facing a corruption charge related to Freeport-McMoRan, Zon briefly took up the speaker's position until Golkar assigned Ade Komaruddin as a replacement. In 2016, Komaruddin was removed from the position due to ethical misconduct and Novanto returned as speaker. Novanto was again implicated in another corruption case in 2017, and Fadli once more was appointed as acting speaker in late 2017. Fake news lawsuit On 12 March 2018, Fadli and fellow House of Representatives Deputy Chairman Fahri Hamzah were reported to Jakarta Police for allegedly spreading fake news and hate-speech on Twitter. Muhammad Rizki reported the pair for re- tweeting fake news from Jawa Pos online. Jawa Pos later clarified and removed the report, whereas Fadli and Fachri had kept the fake news. The report had falsely claimed the head of a fake news organization called Muslim Cyber Army was a supporter of Basuki Tjahaja 'Ahok' Purnama, the former Jakarta governor who was jailed for allegedly insulting Islam. Rizki accused the deputy speakers of violating Indonesia‚Äôs Law on Electronic Information and Transactions. Gerindra responded by saying it was ready to provide Fadli with legal assistance and called on police to be fair in handling the case.

The brewery went into bankruptcy on July 31, 1935, and was subsequently reorganized as Washington Brewery, Inc. It went out of business permanently in August 1938.  Early years  The business began when Edward F. Abner purchased the Albert Brewery at some point in the late 1800s. In 1897, Peter A. Drury became E. F. Abner's partner. Abner, born 1864, was originally from Cologne and had moved to Washington in 1885; Drury, born 1865, was from Ireland. Abner-Drury was located on 25th Street in a block extending from F to G Street NW, in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood. It employed many of Foggy Bottom's German residents. The name of the firm was initially \\"Abner and Drury, Brewers\\", and was changed to \\"Abner-Drury Brewery\\" in 1900. One of its signature products was the Old Glory beer. It made beer from only malt and hops. In 1899, Abner and Drury's neighbor Christian Heurich (of the Christian Heurich Brewing Company) sued them for building their brewery several inches onto his property. Heurich claimed this incursion \\"greatly injured\\" his property, and he sought $25,000 in damages (). Heurich's lot was vacant. In 1905, Abner-Drury, along with a number of other Washington-area brewers comprising the Brewers' Association, was involved in an antitrust suit under the Sherman Act. At the time, Abner- Drury was incorporated under West Virginia law. The case involved a conspiracy in restraint of trade across state borders.Leonard v. Abner-Drury Brewing Co, 25 App.D.C. 161, 1905 WL 17722 (1905).  Prohibition era and after  Abner- Drury Brewery, 1910. From the start of Prohibition in 1918 until 1922, Abner- Drury sold soft drinks. In March 1933, after Franklin D. Roosevelt arranged for an amendment to the Volstead Act to permit near-beer, Abner-Drury sent a truck to the White House with the sign \\"President Roosevelt, the first beer is for you\\". Workers carried cases of beer into the White House, and a crowd spontaneously formed around the truck singing the 1929 song \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\". On April 7, 1933 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an Abner-Drury Brewery truck drove around the city with a U.S. Marine in the back. At each stop, the Marine handed out bottles of beer, and crowds gathered. The police had to step in to restore order. Abner-Drury was one of two pre-Prohibition breweries to re-open in Washington (along with the Christian Heurich Brewing Company). With a campaign on NBC in May 1933, it was among the first to begin radio advertisements for beer after Prohibition ended. It marketed its near-beer with the slogan \\"The Beer with Everything BUT!\\" Given the changed landscape of brewing after Prohibition and the rise of national bottled shipping brewers, the Abner-Drury Brewery had trouble competing. Bankrupt as of 1935, it was briefly revived as The Washington Brewery, Inc. from 1935 to 1938, when it went under permanently. Abner-Drury was sold to a single bidder at an auction in August 1938 to an agent of Charles Jacobsen, who ran the Arlington Bottling Company.

It is believed to act as a symporter for protons and the potassium ion, K+. Firstly discovered in barley, receiving the name of HvHAK1, it was soon after identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and named HAK5. These transporters belongs to the subgroup I of the KT-HAK-KUP family of plant proteins with obvious homology with both bacterial and fungal transport systems, which experienced a major diversification following land conquest. KT-HAK-KUP transporters are one of four different types of K+ transporter within the cell, but are unique as they do not have a putative pore forming domain like the other three; Shaker channels, KCO channels, HKT transporters. It is activated when the plant is situated in low soil with low potassium concentration, and has been shown to be located in higher concentration in the epidermis and vasculature of K+ deprived plants. By turning on, it increases the plants affinity (uptake) of potassium. Potassium plays a vital role in the plants growth, reproduction, immunity, ion homeostasis, and osmosis, which ensures the plants survival. It is the highest cationic molecule within the plant, accounting for 10% of the plants dry weight, which makes its uptake into the plant important. Each plant species has its own HAK5 transporter that is specific to that species and has different levels of affinity to K+. To operate and activate the HAK5 transporter, the external concentration of K+ must be lower than 10ŒºM and up to 200ŒºM. In Arabidopsis plants, when external potassium concentration is lower than 10ŒºM, it is only HAK5 that is involved with the uptake of K+, then between 10 and 200ŒºM both HAK5 and AKT1 are involved with the uptake of K+. HAK5 is coupled with CBL9/CIPK23 kinase's although the mechanism behind this has not yet been understood.  Interaction  The High Affinity K+ transporter interacts with the following proteins * ILK1 * CBL9- CIPK23 * AKT1  Activation  CIPK23 acts to phosphorylate HAK5, the phosphorylation is what activates the HAK5 to take up K+. HAK5 is positively controlled by CIPK23- CBL1-9 complexes, Ca2+ binds with CBL1-9, which then combines with CIPK23 to form a CIPK23/CBL complex, the complex then initiates the up-regulation of the HAK5 protein transporter by phosphorylating the N- terminus of the HAK5. This mechanism acts in a similar way in which ATK1,(another K+ transporter) is activated, however the only difference is that ATK1 only interacts with CBL1 and CBL9, whereas HAK5 interacts with CBL1, CBL8, CBL9 and CBL10.  Functions  High Affinity K+ transporter HAK5 effects multiple functions of the plant when in low potassium concentrations these are; * Osmosis * Ion Homeostasis * Immune Response * Growth = Osmosis = Higher levels of potassium in the roots creates a greater amount of photosynthesis in the leaves by helping to control osmosis occurring throughout the cells. By controlling potassium, the HAK5 potassium transporter plays this important role in osmosis, and creates large influxes of water molecules to the plant to ensure its survival. By increasing the affinity of potassium uptake within the plant, it lowers the concentration of water within the cell. This increases the concentration of solute outside, creating a hypotonic solute. The water will then move into the plant cell via osmosis. = Ion homeostasis = A cell membrane consists of many transport proteins that allow for ion transport, as ions can not simply pass through the gradient due to their charge. High Affinity K+ transporter HAK5, is important for the regulation of K+ ions within the cell. When there is a lack of K+, the HAK5 transporter is activated to uptake K+. This occurs when there is high salinity within the soil, which often happens within the crop industry. If the soil has a high salinity content, this means Na+ from NaCl competes with K+ for uptake because they are similar ions and use the same transporters. However, K+ accounts for the activation of over 50 enzymes, which Na+ cannot be a substitute. With HAK5 transporters, this competition is lowered, as there is a specific transporter for K+ that insures its uptake. The transporter for K+ ensures that the K+ and Na+ maintain homeostasis in the plant. K+ is required for environmental changes like putting the plant into a higher salinity situation. K+ ensures plants are able to adapt to these changes. The only way in which they are able to obtain this K+ whilst in high salinity conditions is through HAK5 transporters regulating the amount because it is only turned on when there is a low concentration of K+ in the soil. = Immune response = HAK5 is linked to disease prevention because if there is a lack of K+ or nutrients within a plant or cell, bacterial growth is promoted. K+ is important for the generation of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) recognition, which is involved in the innate immune system for living cells. PAMPs are the main molecules that run the innate immune system. They consist of either glycans or gylcoconjugates, and they pair with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to initiate an immune response.They send signals to the host cells to show there is a pathogen present. One of the best PRR is FLS2; it binds to flg22 (flagellin), and after just minutes, signaling responses such as kinase cascades, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extracellular alkalization are stimulated. During PAMPs, ion transport across the plasma membrane is important. One particular important ion is K+. The loss of K+ promotes the activation of PAMPs. The loss of anions help the growth of bacteria and the PAMPs system works to fight against foreign pathogens such as bacteria. PRRs recognize PAMPs when there is an infection within the cell. During extreme limitations to K+, HAK5 is the only transporter. When PAMPs are triggered a large number of K+ are introduced to the cell, which signals a downstream immune response. In animal cells the toll-like receptor TLR4 binds the bacterial PAMP LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and induces K+ efflux through the MaxiK K+ channel, activating signal cascades and release of the pro- inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-Œ± HAK5 works alongside other kinase's to help with the immune response within a cell. The main kinase that works with this transporter is Intergrin- Linked Kinase 1 (ILK1). ILK1 works to increase the amount of HAK5 transporters on the plasma membrane during abiotic stress which increases the influx of K+. ILK1 has also been shown to phosphorylate the N-terminal of HAK5, which contributes to plant growth. The phosphorylation helps to aid in the regulation of the HAK5, as well as other complexes such as CBL1 and CIPK23. Those complexes help to enhance HAK5 transport of K+, although the true mechanism is currently unknown. = Growth = HAK5 is important for the plant's growth, especially when the plant is in a low potassium soil environment. This is because in this situation the HAK5 transporter is turned on and has a high affinity for the uptake of potassium, which is important for the growth of the plant. Bpth macro and micro-nutrients are important in enzyme activation, photosynthesis and protein synthesis- all things that are important to ensure growth of the plant. Potassium is being looked at, as being a new fertilizer for plants in areas that soil is low in potassium. It has been shown to helps increase water consumption and nitrogen use in warm season cereals. By using a potassium fertilizer, the use of the HAK5 transporter will decrease because it is only activated at low levels. However, by adding potassium to the soil, nutrient management within the soil will be better balanced.

Career On November 22, 1927, Mary Thomford Sellmer was appointed Deputy Game Warden of Marin County, the first woman Game warden in California and the only one in the world in the 1920s. She acted under the supervision of her husband, Captain Walter B. Sellmer, of the State Fish and Game Commission. She was not an \\"honorary officer\\" like other women before her, but a full-fledged game warden. In one year since her appointment she arrested forty-seven violators of the game laws. She was an expert rifle and pistol shot. In 1929 she was featured in the July number of American Forests. She was a member of the Associated Sportsmen's Club of California and the Marin Rod and Gun Club. Personal life On January 8, 1923, at Hayward, California, Mary Thomford married Captain Walter Bruno Sellmer (May 16, 1891 - August 20, 1982) and they had one son, William Ross Sellmer (1923-1984).

Early career Ripert received his agr√©gation in 1906 from the Faculty of Law of Aix. He taught Mercantile and Marine law at Aix. In 1919 he was called to Paris as a substitute for Marcel Planiol. Ripert undertook the revision of the Trait√© pratique de droit civil fran√ßais by Marcel Planiol, which became a work edited by Ripert but with several authors. The 3-volume Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de droit civil by Planiol et Ripert was rewritten by Ripert and Jean Boulanger. The Trait√© de droit commercial was written by Ripert, then by Ripert and Ren√© Roblot. Other works were the Trait√© de droit maritime and essays such as La r√®gle morale dans les obligations civile (1926) and Le r√©gime d√©mocratique et le droit civil moderne (1936). As Dean of the Faculty of Law of Paris he welcomed Jews in the name of Christianity. World War II (1939‚Äì44) On 6 September 1940 Ripert was named Secretary of State for Public Instruction and Youth, replacing √âmile Mireaux. As Minister of Public Instruction until December 1940 he contributed to elaborating the first Jewish Statute which excluded Jews from universities as students or teachers, and dismissed the Jewish professors, including his pre-war friend Ren√© Cassin. On 13 December 1940 Marshall Philippe P√©tain asked all the ministers to sign a collective letter of resignation during a full cabinet meeting. Pierre Laval, then Minister of Justice, thought it was a device to get rid of Ren√© Belin, the Minister of Labor. However, the Marshal accepted the resignations of Laval and Ripert. Ripert returned to his position as Dean of the Faculty of Law of Paris. He remained a member of the National Council of Vichy throughout the war. He invited students to study National Socialist law objectively. Later career (1944‚Äì58) After the Liberation of France Ripert was arrested on 16 November 1944 and imprisoned until 14 February 1945. In 1947 the High Court of Justice dismissed his case for \\"acts of resistance\\", but no records of the trial were kept. Ripert was reinstated at the university and Institute. Ripert was Honorary Professor at the Faculty of Law in Paris until 1958. He remained conservative, and his D√©clin du droit (1949) strongly criticized the post-war juridical situation. His Les Forces cr√©atrices du droit (1955) also criticized the changes to civil law introduced by new French republic. Ripert died suddenly in the morning of 4 July 1958 while correcting the proofs of the 3rd edition of his Traite- de droit commercial. For his rigorous and elegantly written works Philippe Malaurie calls Ripert the greatest jurist of the 20th century.

Plot This legend was told by the Ancient Spirit, who hid himself at the bottom of a dried-up well in the very middle of Africa. On the shores of Lake Chad many different birds and animals have settled. Once upon a time they decided to elect a king and chose Lion. They called him the bravest, the strongest, the wisest and the most beautiful. Then a son was born to the Leo and the Lioness - Little Lion. When the Little Lion became able to walk alone, he met a hyena who told Little Lion that he is a Lion, hence the king of beasts, which means he was the bravest, the strongest, the wisest, the most beautiful. Little Lion matured, began to move farther from home and came across a well with the Ancient Spirit. Little Lion boasted that he was the bravest, the strongest, the wisest, the most beautiful! The Ancient Spirit laughed and said: \\"You are the most stupid!\\" Then Little Lion was bitten by an ant who was not afraid of anyone, because he defended his anthill. Little Lion said: \\"You are indeed more brave than me, but I am the strongest!\\" The Ant laughed, called Little Lion the most stupid and advised him to find the Bald Elephant. And the Little Lion went to look for the Bald Elephant. And when he saw how a huge elephant easily rips out a tree by the root, he realized who is the strongest! The eagle said: \\"Listen and remember! Do not say that you are brave - you will meet someone braver! Do not say that you are strong - you will meet a stronger one! Do not say that you are wise - you will meet someone more wise!\\" \\"I understand, ‚Äì answered the Little Lion, ‚Äì But who is the most beautiful? \\"The eagle flew away without listening. Some time has passed, the young Lion called the beasts and birds using his roar, and announced that he would tear apart those who would call him the bravest, the strongest, the wisest and the most beautiful. Lion was approached by the young Lioness who said: \\"I fell in love with you at first sight. You can tear me apart, but I'll still say it! You are the most beautiful!\\" The lion smiled at her with a shy smile, because he realized that the one who is loved, is always the most, most, most, most ...

She participated numerous times with the Royal Academy throughout her career from 1870 to 1916, and her works include landscapes, scenes of rural life, and history painting. She was the daughter of travel writer Ellen Louise Clacy. Early life Ellen Louise Clacy was born to the author Ellen Louise Clacy (1830‚Äì1901) in 1853 on a boat from Australia to England. Ellen Clacy Sr. (n√©e Sturmer) married mining engineer Charles Berry Clacy in 1854 and resided in England. Beginning in the 1850s, she wrote novels, newspaper and magazine articles, and travel writing under the pseudonym Cycla. She was best known for an account of Australian gold mines A Lady's Visit to the Gold Diggings of Australia from 1852‚Äì1853. By 1871, Charles Berry Clacy died. The younger Ellen Clacy began her career as a professional artist in the 1870s. Career Clacy exhibited works regularly with the Royal Watercolour Society and Society of British Artists. She exhibited with the Royal Academy twenty seven times from 1872 to 1900. Many of her exhibited works were the results of painting excursions during which she traveled independently in the countryside. Her painting Will Myers, Ratcatcher and Poacher, shown at the Royal Academy in 1885, was painted on a trip \\"up North\\", where Clacy used a local carpenter in his shop as her model. Clacy's works of rural and northern life have been analyzed by art historian Deborah Cherry as the responses of a metropolitan tourist to an unknown place. Her travels also influenced works shown at the Liverpool Academy: The Vagrant (exhibited in 1876 with the lines: \\"But of the wanderer none took thought/ And where it pleased her best she sought/ Her shelter and her bread\\") and Wither (exhibited in 1890); both paintings depict female travelers in the countryside. In 1880, the Walker Art Gallery exhibited Flight, priced at ¬£50 and called \\"a very charming evening landscape\\" by The Academy weekly review. The Old Poacher (1885) was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery in 1886 from the Liverpool Autumn Exhibition for its permanent collection. In 1886 Clacy also exhibited The Cry from the Snowdrift at the Royal Academy, which was reviewed as \\"a carefully-finished work\\" by Truth.

In 1972 she completed a unique double when she won both the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Irish St Leger. After showing some promise when winning a minor race as a juvenile in 1971, she won two of her first three races the following spring before recording an upset win in the Irish 1000 Guineas. In the summer of 1972 she won the Pretty Polly Stakes and was placed in both the Irish Oaks and the Desmond Stakes. On her final run of the year she took her second Irish Classic when she defeated male opponents in the Irish St Leger. She failed to win in the following year and was retired from racing. As a broodmare she produced two minor winners including the Group- placed Fenney Mill. Background Pidget was a \\"tall\\" grey mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Norman Frank Butler. During her racing career she was trained in Ireland by Kevin Prendergast. She inherited her grey coat from her sire Fortino, a French sprinter whose wins included the Prix de l'Abbaye as a three-year-old in 1962. As a breeding stallion, Fortino was best known as the sire of Caro. Her dam Primlace was a minor winner over middle distances and produced several other winners. She was a granddaughter of the Prix Morny winner Necklace who was in turn a daughter of The Oaks winner Straitlace. Racing career =1971: two-year-old season= After finishing third on her racecourse debut, Pidget recorded her first success in a maiden race over seven furlongs. On her final appearance of the year she was brought back in distance and finished sixth in a race over five furlongs. =1972: three-year- old season= Pidget began her second season by winning the Spring Stakes over seven furlongs at Baldoyle Racecourse, beating French Oyster by three quarters of a length. She was then moved up in class to contest the Group 3 Athasi Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh in April and was beaten two lengths into second place by the Vincent O'Brien-trained favourite Arkadina. She then returned to winning form at Phoenix Park Racecourse where she won the Bedford Guineas Trial by a neck from Moppett's Pride. On 13 May she was stepped up to the highest class for the Group 1 Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile soft ground at the Curragh. The betting saw Arkadina made the 7/4 favourite ahead of Princess Bonita (fourth in the English 1000 Guineas) and Klairlone (winner of the Mulcahy Stakes) whilst Pidget started a 20/1 outsider in a sixteen-runner field. Ridden by Wally Swinburn she tracked the leaders before overtaking Arkadina to gain the advantage three furlongs out and although the favourite rallied strongly, Pidget stayed on well to win by half a length. Pidget was moved up in distance when she was sent to England to contest the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 10 June but made little impression on the race and finished eighth behind Ginevra. In July she was dropped back to ten furlongs for the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh and won by three quarters of a length from Royal Reproach from and a field which also included Arkadina and the Coronation Stakes winner Calve. She was back on the track later that month for the Irish Oaks and finished third to Regal Exception and Arkadina. In the Desmond Stakes over ten furlongs in August she was matched against male opposition and again ran well in defeat as she came home second behind the colt Boucher, who went on to win the St Leger Stakes. On 2 September Pidget was sent to France for a strongly-contested edition of the Prix de la Nonette over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished unplaced behind Rescousse. Three weeks later at the Curragh the filly was ridden by T. P. Burns when she attempted to win her second Irish Classic in the Irish St Leger over one and three quarter miles. The favourite for the race was Our Mirage, a British-trained colt who had won the Great Voltigeur Stakes and finished second to Boucher in the St Leger. The best-fancied of the other five runners was Manitoulin a colt from the Vincent O'Brien whose wins included the Royal Whip Stakes and the Blandford Stakes. The closing stages of the race developed into a sustained struggle between Pidget, who was in front on the final turn, and Our Mirage, who emerged as her only serious challenger. Pidget maintained a strong gallop to the end and won by two lengths with a gap of four lengths back to Fire Red in third place. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference caused by Pidget in the straight but left the result unchanged. At the end of the season, the independent Timeform organisation gave Pidget a rating of 120, making her 13 pounds inferior to their best three-year-filly San San. =1973: four-year-old season= Pidget showed some sign of having retained her ability on her first run of 1973, finishing second to the three- year-old colt Cavo Doro in the Ballymoss Stakes in April: the winner went on to finish second in The Derby. She ran sixth in her next race and then finished last of the five runners behind Roberto in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June. A step up in distance for the Ascot Gold Cup later that month brought no improvement and she finished last again. Breeding record At the end of her racing career,Pidget became a broodmare. She produced at least seven foals and two winners between 1977 and 1984: *Frazer, a grey colt, foaled in 1975. Unraced. *Palagonian, a bay colt, foaled in 1976, sired by Habitat. Winner in Ireland. *Fenney Mill, bay filly, 1977, by Levmoss. Pidget's third foal. Won one race in Ireland, third in Ribblesdale Stakes. *Bustereen, bay filly, 1979, by Busted.

The game was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN. The game was the first regular season professional sports event ever held on an active military base, and the first MLB game played in North Carolina. The Marlins defeated the Braves, 5‚Äì2. After the game, the grandstands were removed, and the field became a multi-use sporting ground. Background Tony Clark (left), Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend (center), and Rob Manfred (right) at a pregame press conference In 2015, Major League Baseball (MLB) approached the United States Department of Defense with an idea to host a regular season MLB game at a military base. The following March, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred publicly announced that the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves would play a regular season game at Fort Bragg on July 3, 2016, the day before Independence Day, to honor the nation's military. MLB and the MLB Players Association spent $5 million to convert an unused golf course on the base into a stadium with a capacity of 12,500. Tickets for the game were free to military personnel and their families through a lottery system. The Fort Bragg Game became the first regular season professional sporting event to ever be held on an active military base, and the first MLB regular season game ever held in the state of North Carolina. The game aired on ESPN as part of their Sunday Night Baseball coverage. Dan Shulman provided play-by-play, while Jessica Mendoza and Aaron Boone served as analysts and Buster Olney as a game reporter. ESPN also distributed the game on ESPN Radio, ESPN Deportes, and ESPN Deportes Radio. Before the game, players visited the Womack Army Medical Center. Manfred, Joe Torre, and MLBPA Director Tony Clark visited the local Fisher House. A baseball clinic for over 200 children was held on July 2. After the game, the grounds was converted into a softball field and multipurpose recreational complex for active duty personnel. Game MLB allowed each team to carry an additional position player on their active roster; the Braves called up Ronnier Mustelier from the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, while the Marlins called up Yefri P√©rez from the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. Neither player appeared in the game. =Recap= Fort Bragg Stadium was built solely to host the Fort Bragg Game The Braves served as the home team, while the Marlins were the visitors. Adam Conley was the starting pitcher for Miami, and Matt Wisler started for Atlanta. The game was scoreless through four innings. In the fifth inning, Adeiny Hechavarria hit a triple and scored on a run batted in (RBI) single by J. T. Realmuto. Realmuto scored after singles by Mart√≠n Prado and Christian Yelich. The Braves had the bases loaded in the fifth inning, but failed to score. The Marlins scored three more runs in the final innings; Realmuto scored on an RBI single by Prado in the seventh inning, Giancarlo Stanton hit a triple in the eighth inning and scored on a sacrifice fly hit by Derek Dietrich, and Realmuto hit a home run in the ninth inning. The Braves scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning when Erick Aybar had an RBI double that scored Tyler Flowers, and A. J. Pierzynski hit a sacrifice fly that scored Jeff Francoeur, but were unable to narrow the gap further. The win increased Miami's win-loss record to 43‚Äì39 ( winning percentage), games behind the Washington Nationals in the National League East and games out of a wild card slot.

She represented the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) both locally and internationally and was known for her lectures about her working travels abroad and on the subject of peace. Brinton was the first curator of the Jane Addams Peace Collection which later became the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC). Brinton was a Quaker and a feminist.  Career  Brinton was involved in the distributions of war rations in Pennsylvania during World War I. She did publicity work for the Food Administration in Philadelphia. She also wrote for a local paper. Brinton served as the field secretary for Pennsylvania's branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) in the 1920s and early 1930s. In this capacity, she represented WILPF internationally. She urged WILPF to resist violence in Cuba and for the United States to stop interfering in Cuban affairs. Brinton began an inter-American project to collect the names of Latin American peace activists in 1934, eventually gaining a list of 170 names from 21 different countries. She lectured about her many travels and correspondences with international peace activists, and was considered a noted lecturer by The Philadelphia Inquirer. Brinton started the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC) in 1935. She was first the acting curator of the collection, which contained documents belonging to Jane Addams and other sources that were around 300 years old. Brinton doubled the size of the collection, by taking relevant sources back from the Library of Congress to include in her archive for SCPC. She also found other documents belonging to Addams in 1951, which had been boxed up and placed in the Addams' barn. The special collections of peace seals and stamps were started by Brinton. Brinton retired from the library in 1951. Brinton helped found the interracial Media Fellowship House and a wing of the house was built using money from her memorial fund. After her death, United Nations delegates and others held a concert in her memory.

From 1982 to 1993, she taught design and Fiber Arts courses at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) of Santa Fe and later taught at the University of Las Vegas. She won first place awards for her contemporary Native American fashion from the Santa Fe Indian Market each year between 1982 and 1987. Her artwork is on display at IAIA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philbrook Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. Early life Kimberly Ann Ponca, known as Wendy, was born in 1960 in Texas to Barbara Ann (n√©e Furr) and Carl Ponca. She grew up on the McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas. Her father, an Osage Nation artist and instructor who grew up on the Osage Reservation near Fairfax, Oklahoma met her mother, an interior designer, while they were attending the Kansas City Institute of Technology and Design. After completing her primary education, she attended Ft. Davis Central High School, before beginning her art studies at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She studied the course \\"Traditional Techniques\\" under Sandy Wilson, who had replaced the course creator Josephine Myers-Wapp (Comanche/Sac & Fox), who had recently retired. In 1977, as part of a community outreach program, the IAIA's fashion show was presented to the Chamber of Commerce of Santa Fe's Women's Division with Ponca as the emcee. After completing her education at IAIA in 1977, she studied art in New York and weaving in Greece. Ponca went on to study at the Kansas City Art Institute, where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1982 in Fiber arts and then she completed a master's degree in art therapy at Southwestern College of Santa Fe. Career After completing her bachelor's degree, Ponca went to work as a costume designer at the Santa Fe Opera in 1982. Around the same time, she founded Waves of the Earth Fashion Group to market her fashion designs. At the end of the opera season, she was hired as Wilson's replacement for the \\"Traditional Techniques\\" course at IAIA. She also taught courses in Fashion Design, where she was known for her stress on patternmaking, tailoring and monitoring the structural integrity of the garments. In 1987, the \\"Traditional Techniques\\" course was renamed as Fiber Arts, facilitating credit transfers to other universities. It incorporated the use of Native American media, like beadwork and weaving techniques, as well as fiber manipulation, dyeing and design for both two- and three-dimensional works. Ponca and her students put on fashion shows under the Waves of the Earth banner to give the students exposure to marketing their wares. They also participated in Southwestern Association for Indian Arts's annual Santa Fe Indian Market (SWAIA Market) fashion show which featured garments designed by IAIA students. As a designer, Ponca chose to show her work in fashion shows rather than in gallery settings, because gallery owners wanted stereotypical Native garments and were more adverse to the incorporation of outside influences. Showing her works at the Santa Fe Indian Market, Ponca earned first place ribbons for contemporary design each year between 1982 and 1987. After participating in the SWAIA Market for seven years, she decided to try other venues to diversify her exposure. In the mid-1980s, she co-founded Native Influx, which was later renamed as Native Uprising. The collective allowed artists, designers, and models to share in creating and profiting from their shows. It was the first organization of cooperation between Native American artists and founding members included Marcus Amerman (Choctaw), RoseMary Diaz (Santa Clara Tewa), Jackie Kee, Patricia Michaels (Taos Pueblo), Char Romero, and Carol Sandoval. Lloyd Kiva New (Cherokee Nation) served as an advisor and supported the group, whose focus was on creating a platform for Native Americans to compete in the fashion industry while marrying innovative new design with American Indian customary symbols and cultural practices. In two-dimensional art, Ponca's works in the 1980s and 1990s utilized an eclectic mix of materials such as abalone shell, antlers, buckskin, felt, metal and other materials to create collages. She also made blankets, shawls and wall hangings and while her works incorporated Pan-Indian themes and those from various non-Native cultures, she also produced more culturally significant items highlighting Osage themes. In the 1990s, she incorporated Mylar, a polyester film first used in space travel, into her fashion designs. Its draping qualities, the sound it made when a model walked, and its symbolic relationship to the sky fit her fashion collection that reflected the Sky and Earth moieties of Osage people. She also experimented with body painting for her models inspired by historic Osage tattooing practices. The body paintings often represented Osage iconography like spiders and snakes, as well as floral or ribbonwork patterns. Ponca left IAIA in 1993 and within two years, the school ceased offering its fashion program. She continued participating in high fashion events, such as the Indian Chic: An American Indian Fashion Show hosted by the Denver Art Museum in 1998, as well as Culture Embodied and Culture Embodied II, for which she also directed for IAIA in 2000. Culture Embodied was held in Albuquerque and the second show corresponded with the annual Santa Fe Indian Market. In 1995, Ponca was commissioned to create four blankets by Pendleton Woolen Mills for a special edition series. The blankets were featured at an exhibition hosted by the American Textile History Museum in 2000. After a stint teaching at the University of Las Vegas, Ponca moved to Fairfax, Oklahoma, and has continued to design and exhibit her creations. She has served as the Director of Development for Tulsa's National Indian Monument Institute. Ponca's collection Wedding Clothes of the Earth and Sky People was exhibited at the Osage Tribal Museum in 2013. In 2016, Pendleton released another limited edition blanket designed by Ponca with the proceeds designated to benefit the Osage Nation Foundation. That same year, she exhibited at Philbrook Museum in the Native Fashion Now showing, which was created by the Peabody Essex Museum and toured the country before being exhibited at the National Museum of the American Indian of the Smithsonian Institution. Ponca has works displayed at IAIA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philbrook Museum of Art, and the National Museum of the American Indian.

The length of the berthing front of the seaports is about , and the length of the channels (Kherson sea channel, Bug-Dnieper-Liman channel (BDLC) and Deepwater Navigation Course (DNC) \\"Danube ‚Äì Black Sea runs through distributary \\"Bystre\\") reach (40 km, 81,368 km and 3,4 km respectively). Even though port authorities practice \\"landlord-port\\" management model by providing public services to state and private stevedores and shipping lines, land management is actually executed by relevant regional or municipal authorities. Today, the largest Ukrainian seaports are Pivdennyi, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Chornomorsk, which account for about 80% of the total throughput of Ukrainian seaports. The key advantages of these seaports are the availability of deep-water approaches that enable the service of large- capacity marine vessels, including the involvement of private entities in providing handling services. Other seaports of Ukraine can accept vessels with a lower draft, and servicing of cargo flows in which, in vast majority, is provided by stevedoring companies of state ownership. A number of ferry lines also operates in Ukraine, sea container lines connecting Ukraine with the ports of the Black Sea basin, and is an integral part of the international transport corridors: TRACECA, New Silk Road, Pan-European No. 9 and others. Major multimodal port is Chornomorsk with its ferry-railway multimodal terminal with services to Port, Batumi, Varna, and number of Turkish ports. The servicing of container lines is currently provided by container terminals located in the ports of Odesa (HHLA CTO, Brooklyn-Kiev Port), Chornomorsk (Fish port and State Stevedoring Company Chornomorsk) and Pivdennyi (TIS- Container terminal) with their total capacity of 3 130 thousand TEU per year. The indicated volume will be increased in the nearest future by 600 thousand TEU due to the newly created capacities of the container terminal at the Quarantine Mole of the Port of Odesa. Servicing of passenger and cruise vessels on international and domestic lines is carried out by passenger terminals in the ports of Reni, Izmail and Ust-Dunaisk (with a port point in Vilkovo city), as well as a passenger complex in Port of Odesa. Starting 2018, USPA was assigned a function to maintain navigation characteristics on inland waterways, namely on Dnipro, Pripyat', and other rivers by executing number of activities, including dredging. For that purpose, USPA new branch \\"Dredging Fleet\\" was established. International cooperation In 2018 Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority joined European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) as an observer member, in 2019 - European Federation of Inland Ports (EFIP). Since 2017 USPA has established partnership agreement with EBRD on preparation of two pilot concession projects in the ports of Kherson and Olvia.

Ahmadinejad had some tendency toward Iranian nationalism which deviated from the clerics' theocratic rule, hence top clerics labeled the faction associated with him as \\"deviant current\\". The term was coined in 2011, after an open conflict between Ahmadinejad and the Supreme leader Ali Khamenei.  People  People who have been described as associated with the \\"deviant current\\" include: * Mahmoud Ahmadinejad * Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, described as the leader of the movement * Hamid Baghaei * Mohammad Reza Rahimi * Ali Nikzad *Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi * Mohammed Sharif Malekzadeh * Mohammad Aliabadi * Ali Akbar Javanfekr * Abdolreza Davari, senior media figure in presidential administration * Habibollah Joz-e-Khorasani, financial affairs director of the presidential administration * Abbas Amirifar, cleric, head of the cultural committee of presidential administration * Kazem Kiapasha, presidential aide * Bahman Sharifzadeh, cleric * Abbas Ghaffari, allegedly Ahmadinejad's personal exorcist *Ali Asghar Parhizkar, executive director of the Arvand Free Zone *Alireza Moghimi, executive director of the Aras Free Zone *Parivash Satvati, widow of Hossein Fatemi  Ideology  The faction is described as \\"nationalist conservative\\" by Stratfor; also described as \\"neo-conservative nationalists\\" by Pejman Abdolmohammadi, assistant professor in Middle Eastern studies at University of Trento and Giampiero Cama, professor of comparative politics at University of Genova. According to Bernd Kaussler, assistant professor of political science at James Madison University, their ideology is a combination of millenarian, nationalist, populist and the principlist rhetoric. The tendency tries to nationalize Shiite Islamism, and advocates an ‚ÄúIranian School of Islam‚Äù which seems antagonistic toward the Velayat Faqih, an idea that formed the basis of the current establishment in Iran. Ahmadinejad and his associates have regularly used the word \\"spring\\" and the phrase \\"Long live the spring\\" as a slogan, which is believed to have connotations for the Arab Spring, although Ahmadinejad claims it refers to the reappearance of Imam Mahdi.  Organization  A group is active under the acronym HOMA (standing for Havadarn-e Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Persian, meaning \\"Supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\") and published an online newspaper with the same name. The public relations team organizes various websites, including (), () and Meydan-e Haftadodo (, named after the neighborhood Ahmadinejad lives in) among others. They maintain online activity elsewhere, running many blogs and social media accounts.  Electoral performance  =2012= Monotheism and Justice Front, a group that endorsed a list of candidates for 2012 parliamentary elections is reportedly linked to Mashaei. The results showed a major defeat for them in the elections, and they only won 9 seats, according to Deutsche Welle. = 2013 = In a Medvedev/Putin-style scenario, Mashaei ran for president in 2013 presidential election backed by Ahmadinejad, who said \\"Mashaei means Ahmadinejad and Ahmadinejad means Mashaei\\". He was disqualified by the Guardian Council. 2013 local elections were the next defeat. The faction were unable to secure a seat in Tehran City Council and even Parvin, Ahmadinejad's sister was unseated. = 2017 = In 2017 presidential election, Ahmdinejad who backed Hamid Baghaei, registered as a candidate along with him, but both were disqualified. = 2020 = Candidates associated with the circle ran on a list for 2020 parliamentary elections, although Ahmadinejad himself did not support any specific list.

Born in Dysart, Fife, in 1795, George Maclean was the son of William Maclean, himself the son of George MacAllan, a Dysart Colliery manager. George Maclean entered the commissariat department of the army in 1812. He received the War Medal with two Clasps for Orthes and Toulouse, both battles being in 1814. On 22 October 1816, he was promoted to Deputy Asstistant Commissary General. In about 1834, whilst serving in Nassau, Bahama Islands as an officer in the Commissariat Department, he was ordered to Sierra Leone as Assistant Commissary General of Stores, with his family moving to Dysart, the father‚Äôs birthplace and family residence. After five years‚Äô continuous service in Sierra Leone, he was promoted and posted to Hobart, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), at that time Great Britain‚Äôs convict settlement, where among other matters, he was particularly concerned about the cost of mining coal and of the inefficient coal mining operation. On 23 Dec 1842 he was promoted to Deputy Commissary General. British concerns at the perceived failure of the British commissariat and transport arrangements in the Crimea led to reviews of those of other nations, and Commissary General George Maclean examined the Austrian system, while a commission, under Major General Knollys, was sent to Paris to learn from the intendance. George Maclean was initially appointed in charge of the arrangements in Constantinople, and subsequently succeeded William Filder as Commissary-General commanding the Commissariat in the East during the latter part of the siege of Sevastopol, for which he was awarded the Medal and Clasp. For his services during the Crimean War, he was appointed a K.C.B. He was also appointed to the Order of the Medjidie, 4th Class.

In the low-budget action film, the locale of South America jungles provides an exciting venue for \\"flyboy\\" Jack Holt, who is trying to establish a new route for an American airline. Plot Headstrong pilot Bill Kellogg (Dick Purcell), despite landing safely, flew his airliner into a storm, and is fired. When, his boss at Trans Continental Airways, Jim Horne (Jack Holt), finds out Bill has secretly wed Joan Hammond (Jacqueline Wells), the daughter of the airline's owner, he relents and allows Bill to keep his job. Fellow pilot, Ike Matthews (James Burke), is assigned to a proving flight over the western coast of the South American jungle to photograph potential landing fields. Bill is jealous of the publicity that the first flight will achieve and steals the aircraft to do the job himself. Flying in the same irresponsible way that made him dangerous, Bill pushes on, even when he is radioed that there is insufficient fuel on board. In running out of gas, Bill chooses to crash-land near an Indian village. Only an Indian woman, L-ana (Karen Sorrell) helps Bill, as the villagers refuse to help him get back to civilization. Bill tries but is unable to get the radio working to send out an emergency message. Jim and Ike fly over the South American jungle, but a storm prevents them from spotting the village. They continue on to Rio Vista where the pilots meet Joan and for her sake, Jim organizes a rescue mission. Led by natives, the rescuers finds a village holding Dr. Butler (Robert Fiske) captive. After a fierce battle, the doctor is freed but meanwhile, Bill, despondent over his fate, has taken on the native ways by marrying L-ana. Jim's expedition finally locates the tribe, but when he sees Bill's new life and native marriage, the two men cannot reconcile what has happened. Knowing he is now able to get back home, Bill leaves without L-ana, but her brother (Fritz Leiber) is enraged at this affront, and kills him. After returning to Rio Vista, Jim tells Joan that Bill died in the accident, sacrificing himself to avoid landing in a field full of women and children. Bill is able to allow Joan to accept that her husband still loved her and died courageously.

It was originally released in May 2008, exclusively to the game's website, but was later to released as an enhanced version entitled Love+ on February 7, 2014 to Early Access, with its final release being on February 14, 2014. For the game's fifth anniversary, it was released on Nintendo Switch on February 14, 2019. The game's art style is minimalistic; every level in the game has only three colors: black, white, and a custom third that varies each level, where white serves to indicate interactive objects, black serves as the background, and the third color makes the platforms. The game also carries a pixel art style. On November 7, 2017, a sequel titled LOVE 2: kuso was released, which includes all sixteen main levels from Love+. A third entry in the series LOVE 3, was announced in 2020.  Gameplay  The official gameplay trailer for Love+ on Steam. A comparison of the first level of Love and the first level of Love+. Love is a 2D platformer. The player character (known as fiveEight, as revealed in kuso) runs through several linear levels. They possess three abilities: jumping, moving left and right, and leaving a checkpoint behind at the push of a button. The player has 100 lives to play through 20 levels, in which the goal is to reach the end point in each to progress to the next. Love+ nearly completely revamped the original game. It added three new game modes: \\"Easy Mode\\", which gives the player unlimited lives, \\"YOLO Mode\\", in which the player has only one life, and \\"Speedrun Mode\\", in which the goal is to finish the game in the shortest possible time. The original mode was renamed to \\"Arcade Mode\\". Many of the levels in the original game were scrapped, being replaced by completely new levels, and those that were carried over were heavily altered. Overall, Love+ has fewer levels in its main campaign than Love, with Love having twenty and Love+ having sixteen. In updates, five more levels were added to Love+'s original line-up of eleven. Additionally, a fifth game mode titled \\"Remix Mode\\" was added in an update, which has the player play through seven \\"remixes\\" of levels from the main game, and later, in another update, a \\"bonus level\\" based on World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros. was added.  Plot  fiveEight wakes up in a strange mechanical world, where everything they once knew has been replaced by machinery. They have no memory of what happened, except that things were much better before they woke up. They have nothing pushing them forward except a feeling in the back of their mind, telling them that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, with nothing but the hope of getting to something better.  Development  Love was initially released to the website trunks.fireball20xl.com, first for a price of $1, but then for free. The game was later remade as Love+ and released to Steam under the title of LOVE. When creating custom levels, the game engine uses the bottom left pixel as the background color. = Music = The game's soundtrack was composed by James Bennett. The soundtrack has been described as \\"brilliant\\", and Bennett's compositional style has been said to be akin to \\"a 45-year old ice cream van making its way to the moon.\\"  Reception  Anthony Burch of Destructoid called the original game \\"charming\\", saying it was \\"straight platforming at its most inspired and difficult\\". Tim W. of Indiegames.com recommended the game for fans of \\"frustrating platformers\\". Jonathan Kaharl of Hardcore Gaming 101 said that Love+ \\"demonstrates there is perfection to be found within simplicity\\". Tom Sykes praised it as being \\"all the retro platforming you need\\".

Projapoti in Bengali symbolizes love, marriage and togetherness and 'Biskut' has the crispness and these combine the story. Aditya Sengupta and Esha played the new couple role.  Plot  Sraboni / Shaon (Ishaa Saha) and Antor Sen (Aditya Sengupta) have been married for 2 years and 5 months, and live in a joint family with Antor's parents, brother, sister-in-law and niece. Unbeknownst to her draconian, Rabindrasangeet-loving, idealist mother-in-law, Shaon has a career writing scripts for Bengali soaps (watching which too are strictly forbidden in the household). In contrast to the fiercely independent Shaon, Antor is usually indecisive and equivocates every time he is asked for his opinion on any matter. Shaon and Antor are unable to conceive because Shaon suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome - something which causes her a lot of mental anguish. When Shaon's friend Parijat Mukherjee becomes pregnant by her boyfriend Matthew and wants to abort the baby, Shaon convinces her to go ahead with the pregnancy and gives her the word that she will adopt the baby and provide it a fine upbringing. Shaon's short-lived dreams of motherhood however are soon shattered when Matthew comes back and takes responsibility for the child, and Parijat goes back on her word. The heartbreak in addition to her frustration with the restrictive household causes Shaon to leave her in laws home and seek refuge with her eccentric father and mother (Aparajita Auddy). However, Antor and Shaon soon run into each other and Shaon expresses her wish to go out for a beer with her estranged husband. Subsequently, the two celebrate their wedding anniversary by checking into a cheap hotel in Diamond Harbour. At the hotel, Shaon confesses that she values her independence of thought, dressing and cultural taste - and was rather restrained in Antor's house. As they are about to reconcile, the couple is arrested by the police on charges of immoral behaviour - something that they manage to escape once Antor's elder brother turns up at the police station with their marriage certificate. Antor becomes disillusioned with the city and welcomes the transfer to Bhilai. 2 days before his journey, he asks to meet Shaon one last time. As they meet, Shaon tells Antor that she is willing to accompany him to Bhilai. A grateful Antor tells her that he will give her whatever she wants in Bhilai, indicating her freedom in his company as well as motherhood.

It was founded in 2006 by American actor and director David Staller. Its mission is to present works that carry the humanitarian values of writer and critic George Bernard Shaw. It presents several series, including the annual festival Shaw New York, and the monthly series of staged readings, Project Shaw. Through this series, GTG became the first theatre group to present all 65 of George Bernard Shaw's plays. History and description Gingold Theatrical Group is a Manhattan-based theatre company under the Artistic Direction of David Staller, who founded the group in 2006. Staller believed that the English playwright and critic, George Bernard Shaw, created work that made the strongest statements on human rights. He named the group after his friend Hermione Gingold, together with whom he read Shaw's plays. Stephen Brown-Fried serves as the group's Associate Director, and Alyce Stark is the group's general manager. =Project Shaw= Staller began the group's work with staged readings of plays either by Shaw, his contemporaries, or those inspired by him.Smith, Wendy. \\"The Shaw Must Go On: David Staller Makes the Case for the Writer‚Äôs Many Facets\\", American Theatre, November 2014, accessed 3 June 2018 The series, Project Shaw, presents 11 staged readings a year. Each of these staged readings are either plays by or inspired by George Bernard Shaw. In 2009, Gingold Theatrical Group became the first theatre group to have produced all 65 of George Bernard Shaw's plays through Project Shaw. Initially held at New York's Players' Club, the performances were moved to a larger venue at New York's Symphony Space in 2014. On January 19, 2015, Project Shaw held its 100th performance. As of July 2017, 124 Project Shaw had presented 124 concert productions. =Shaw New York= In 2012, the group began to hold an annual festival called Shaw New York. Here, they produce a fully staged production, together with symposiums, concerts, and staged readings. They began the annual festival with their production of Shaw's Man and Superman, which was a New York Times Critics' Pick. The play was co- produced by The Irish Repertory Theatre and was extended past its initial limited engagement. Since then, GTG has presented Shaw's You Never Can Tell and Major Barbara in a co-production with The Pearl Theatre, and Shaw's Widowers' Houses with The Actors Company Theatre. =New works= GTG currently holds two programs which focus on the development of new works. The first program, Press Cuttings, was inspired by Shaw's career. Prior to becoming a playwright, Shaw was an art critic. The program's focus is to develop the works of art critics looking to follow in Shaw's footsteps. This program led to the development of David Cote's play Otherland. In 2017, GTG announced another program, Speakers' Corner, in which a group of writers of diverse backgrounds develops new work inspired by narratives of George Bernard Shaw. Response In New York Magazine, Jesse Green stated that \\"Gingold Theatrical Group provides an invaluable ‚Äì and unique ‚Äì service to New Yorkers. Not only does it keep topnotch productions of great works of art before the public on a regular basis as no other theater company can, but it also does something less obvious. It keeps the tradition of intelligent argument, embodied in Shaw's plays but otherwise much lacking from public discourse, alive for those who need it most: the thinking people of a great city.\\" In a 2012 review of Man and Superman, Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Staller's \\"fluency is apparent. ‚Ä¶ In its intellectual energy and exhilarating vivacity, this production honors Shaw‚Äôs life force as well.\\" Michael Musto stated, \\"David Staller's Project Shaw is an invaluable testament to the beauty of Shaw's work...

Jalore was ruled by the Chahamana ruler Kanhadadeva, whose armies had earlier fought several skirmishes with the Delhi forces, especially since Alauddin's conquest of the neighboring Siwana fort. Kanhadadeva's army achieved some initial successes against the invaders, but the Jalore fort ultimately fell to an army led by Alauddin's general Malik Kamal al-Din. Kanhadadeva and his son Viramadeva were killed, thus ending the Chahamana dynasty of Jalore.  Background  The kingdom of Jalore was ruled by a branch of the Chahamanas. In 1291-92 Alauddin's predecessor Jalaluddin Khalji invaded Jalore, but was forced to retreat after the Vaghelas came to the rescue of the Jalore king Samantasimha. From at least 1296-1305, Samantasimha's son and successor Kanhadadeva jointly ran the administration with his father. During this period, in 1299, Alauddin dispatched an army to Gujarat, and defeated the Vaghelas. During the army's return to Delhi, some of its soldiers staged an unsuccessful mutiny. The 17th- century chronicler Nainsi states that the Jalore army supported this mutiny, although this is doubtful. = Cause of invasion = The 16th-century chronicler Firishta claims that Kanhadadeva (\\"Nahar Deo\\") accepted Alauddin's suzerainty around 1305. Some years later Kanhadadeva heard Alauddin boasting that no Hindu ruler could challenge him. This rekindled Kanhadadeva's sense of pride, and he decided to attack Alauddin, resulting in an invasion of Jalore. This narrative is also repeated by 17th-century historian Hajiuddabir. According to legends in PadmanƒÅbha's Kanhadade Prabandha (15th century) and Munhot Nainsi's Khyat (17th century), one of Alauddin's daughters fell in love with Kanhadadeva's son Virama. However, Virama did not want to marry a Turkic girl, which led to tensions between the two kingdoms, and ultimately resulted in Alauddin's invasion of Jalore. These narratives by Nainsi, Firishta and Hajiuddabir are historically unreliable. By 1310 Alauddin had subjugated the kingdoms surrounding Jalore, including Gujarat, Malwa, Chittor, Ranthambore and Siwana. It appears that he attacked Jalore simply because he wanted to put an end to Jalore's independent status.  Initial skirmishes  Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau states that after conquering Siwana, Alauddin returned to Delhi, ordering his generals to subjugate other parts of the Marwar region. According to Jinaprabha Suri's Vividha Tirtha Kalpa, the Delhi army desecrated a Mahavira temple at Satyapura (modern Sanchor) in 1310. The 15th-century epic romance Kanhadade Prabandha, which presents Kanhadadeva as a hero, states that Alauddin's forces also captured and sacked Barmer and Bhinmal. At Bhinmal the invaders took away a large number of Brahmins as captives. According to Kanhadadeva Prabandha, these disturbances prompted Kanhadadeva to dispatch an army to counter the Delhi forces. This army was led by Devada chiefs Jaita and Mahipa, who were supported by three other generals: Lakhana Sevata (or Sebhata), Salha Sobhita and Ajayasi Molhana. Kanhadadeva's army defeated one of the Delhi contingents left behind by Alauddin and recovered the plunder that the invaders had obtained during their raids of Bhinmal, Satyapura and other places. After this victory Jaita and Mahipa returned to Jalore with the war spoils. The three other generals remained near the battlefield with a portion of the army, and celebrated the new moon day (Amavasya) by taking their armor off and bathing in a river. During these celebrations they started beating a drum captured from the Delhi army. The drum was heard by Delhi Gen. Malik Naib, who was leading another contingent on a hunting expedition. Assuming that the drum beats were a summon for him, Malik Naib rushed to the battlefield. His army inflicted a crushing defeat upon Kanhadadeva's remaining forces. The Kanhadade Prabandha states that the defenders lost 4,000 soldiers, including the three generals, in this battle.  Siege of Jalore  After the initial setbacks faced by the Delhi forces, Alauddin sent an army to launch a direct attack on Jalore. According to the Kanhadade Prabandha, the Delhi forces made several attempts to breach the fort during the first seven days of the ensuing siege. However, these attacks were foiled by sorties led by Kanhadadeva's brother Maladeva and his son Viramadeva. On the eighth day a severe thunderstorm forced the besiegers to retreat. The Jalore forces launched an eight-pronged attack on one of the retreating detachments at Moklana. The eight Jalore generals who led this attack were Maladeva, Viramadeva, Ananta Sisodia, Jaita Vaghela, Jaita Devada, Lunakarna Malhana, Jayamala and Sahajapala. The detachment's commander Shams Khan was captured along with his harem, while the rest of his soldiers fled. The 16th-century chronicler Firishta claims that the Delhi army was commanded by Alauddin's concubine Gul Bihisht. During the war she died after a short illness. After her death the army was led by her son Shahin, who was killed in a battle soon after his mother's death. Firishta's claim is dubious, as it is not found in any contemporary accounts. Moreover, it seems absurd that Alauddin appointed a concubine as the commander of his army or that his soldiers would accept this appointment. The story of Gul Bihisht appears to be a late invention, designed to cover up the disgraceful retreat of the Delhi army. Firishta also inaccurately dates the invasion of Jalore to 1308 instead of 1311. = Kamal al-Din's attack = Next, Alauddin dispatched a stronger army led by Malik Kamal al-Din Gurg, one of his best generals. The Kanhadade Prabandha mentions that Kanhadadeva sent two contingents to check the advance of Kamal al-Din. One of these contingents was commanded by Maladeva and was stationed at Vadi. The other was led by Viramadeva and was stationed at Bhadrajun. The two contingents engaged the Delhi army on alternate days, leading to heavy losses on both sides. They managed to slow down the Delhi army but were unable to prevent Kamal al-Din's gradual advance towards Jalore. Ultimately, Kanhadadeva decided to recall both his contingents to Jalore for consultation. When Kamal al-Din got close to Jalore, Maladeva was sent to fight him while Viramadeva stayed behind to help his father prepare for the impending siege. Kamal al-Din besieged the fort and tried to impose a blockade, most likely intending to starve the defenders. According to Kanhadade Prabandha, this strategy was thwarted by timely rains and cooperation from money lenders (mahajans) who helped replenish the fort's stores. The text also suggests that Maladeva briefly harassed Kamal al-Din's forces, but an army dispatched by Alauddin forced Maladeva's forces to retreat to Vandara. Another Jalore contingent led by Lunakarna destroyed an enemy outpost at Udalapura, a suburb of Jalore, defeating Malik Nizamuddin. The Kanhadade Prabandha as well as Nainsi's Khyat attribute the fall of Jalore to treachery by a Dahiya Rajput named Bika. After the invaders promised to make Bika the new ruler of Jalore, he led them to an unfrequented and unprotected entrance to the fort. When Bika's wife Hiradevi learned about his betrayal, she killed him and reported the matter to Kanhadadeva. However, by this time the defenders were no longer in a position to achieve a victory. Consequently, the men of the fort prepared for a last stand, and Kanhadadeva's son Viramadeva was crowned king. The women decided to die in jauhar (mass suicide by self-immolation). The Kanhadade Prabandha states that 1584 jauhar fires were lit in Jalore. Women of all castes died in this fire, including Kanhadadeva's queens Jaitalde, Bhavalde, Umade and Kamalade. The Delhi forces breached the fort, and thousands of Kanhadadeva's soldiers died in the ensuing fighting. Several of his samantas (feudal chiefs) were also killed in the battle, including Kandhala, Kanha Uhcha, Jaita Devada, Lunakarna Malhana, Arjuna, and Jaita Vaghela. According to the Kanhadade Prabandha, after breaching the fort the invaders took five days to reach the temple of Kanhasvami inside it. When they threatened to destroy the temple, Kanhadadeva and the last 50 of his surviving soldiers died defending it. Nainsi's Khyat suggests that many people believed that Kanhadadeva managed to survive and disappeared. His son Viramadeva is said to have died about three days after the coronation.  Aftermath  Alauddin commissioned a mosque on the fort premises to commemorate this victory. Jalore remained under Muslim rule well into the Tughluq era.

It is part of the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD). The park is accessible from the Donlon Hill Staging Area, which is on Dublin Boulevard near Dublin, California. Geography Dublin Hills Regional Park is largely undeveloped and serves primarily as wildlife habitat. There are several trails within the park that serve hikers, bikers and equestrians. However, there are no reservable campsites or picnic sites. The most notable geographic feature in the park is a ridge which starts at Donlon Point, on the southern boundary of the park, and runs northward to Wiedeman Hill, which lies outside the northern boundary. The ridge acts as an open space corridor through the park, although it is interspersed with steep canyons. = Boundaries = The park is bounded on the south by I-580, Schaefer Ranch on the southwest, private grazing land to the northwest, north and northeast and the California Highlands on the southeast.\\"Dublin Hills Regional Park.\\" East Bay Regional Park District. Accessed August 22, 2017. = Hiking = The main trail in the park, the 2-mile Calaveras Ridge Regional Trail, follows the Calaveras Ridge into the Dublin Hills. Towards the end of the trail, the Calaveras Ridge merges with higher mountains, and the trail divides, both parts coming to an end at private property shortly after. The Calaveras Trail does not climb to the top of Donlon Point. To climb Donlon Point, a 1/3-mile trail must be taken to the top of this hill. A network of short trails (the Donlon Loop Trail) leads to a housing development along Dublin Boulevard. Hikers are not allowed to park in this housing development. A loop can be made with this network of short trails, although this route is too narrow for cyclists and equestrians. A further Martin Canyon Creek Trail, which connects to both the Donlon Loop Trail and the Calaveras Ridge Trail, goes in the direction of the Martin Canyon Creek Trail open space. Other minor trails come to dead-ends at the edges of the park.

He founded Grupo Frente, which included fellow artists Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, and Franz Weissmann, among others, and was known for mentoring many artists in Brazil.  Early life and education  Serpa was born in the Tijuca neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From 1946 to 1948, Serpa studied printmaking with printmaker Axl Leskoschek in Rio de Janeiro. Serpa was also mentored by the art critic, M√°rio Pedrosa. But in general terms, Serpa did not have much formal training in art.  Career  From 1949 and 1952, Serpa taught painting, sculpture, and art theory at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, where he often held an open studio which incorporated critical review of student work with a new pedagogy of allowing instinctual exploration of innate creativity. The teaching style also reflected new ideas about national identity, and had a focus on the modern, incorporating ideas of democracy that were taking place in the country as a whole ‚Äì all in direct contrast to the more traditional, European based art school model. This weekly event became a salon for many up and coming artists that would later be major contributors to the neo-concrete and concrete art movement in Brazil. Serpa had also previously taught art therapy to psychiatric patients at the Occupational Therapy center of the National Psychiatric Hospital in Brazil. Serpa's first works were created in 1951. The paintings were serialized, and often incorporated architectural elements. In 1954, Serpa co-founded Grupo Frente, which included artists Alu√≠sio Carv√£o, Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, among others. In 1954, Serpa published a book he wrote with Mario Pedrosa called, Crescimento e cria√ß√£o, which incorporated his work as a teaching children. He often gave free art classes to children. From 1957 to 1959, Serpa won the foreign travel prize at the 6th Sal√£o Nacional de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro. This prize allowed him to travel to Europe, focusing on Italy and Spain, but also including France, Germany, Holland, Portugal, and Switzerland. During this time Serpa lived in Paris in 1957, where his work was displayed at concrete and neo-concrete art shows. In the 1960s, Serpa worked as a paper conservator at the National Library. This work led to experimentation with paper collage, where he incorporated methodologies from the conservation, restoration, and preservation techniques he used in this position. He often worked with Lygia Pape on art projects. Serpa's 1962 series, Fase negra (Black Phase), reflected the political environment in Brazil at that time. In mid-1960s, Serpa reconnected with geometric art, which moved his work toward kinetic and op art.  Personal life  In 1949, Serpa married Lygia Serpa. They had a son, Yves Serpa, who was born in 1951; a daughter, Leila Serpa, born in 1955; and son, Heraldo Serpa, born in 1958. In 1973, Serpa died at the age of 50 from a heart attack and stroke.

It is a paramilitary force which is under the authority of the Ministry of Defence and its operational duties in peacetime are organized and commanded by the Inter-Institutional Operational Maritime Center (QNOD). The Coast Guard has the responsibility for the security of Albanian territorial waters, maritime surveillance and law enforcement, as well as search and rescue. In operational combat situations in peacetime or wartime, the direction and command of the Albanian Coast Guard passes to military authorities and Albanian Naval Force. Since November 21, 2016, Albanian Coast Guard joined the SNMG2 in Aegean Sea, as NATO member state.  History  The Albanian Coast Guard was established in 2002, following the ratification by the parliament of the relevant law No. 8875, dated 4 April 2002 \\"on Coast Guard\\". The Coast Guard was equipped with 6 patrol vessels 200 Class Super Speranza, donated by Italian Coast Guard, which joined the three Seaspectre Mk III and the two 45' PCC Class, donated by US Coast Guard in 1999‚Äì2001. In August of the same year, 14 vessels of the Navy and the Coast Guard participated in the extensive trafficking operation \\"Puma\\", in cooperation with the law enforcement agencies, anti-smuggling, fisheries, etc., which successfully made possible the blocking of the maritime traffic between Albania and Italy. In 2004, the Coast Guard receives as a donation 6 other patrol vessels, also from the Italian Coast Guard. This time they were 2000 Class patrol vessel. =Damen Stan 4207 patrol vessels= Even prior to the country's NATO accession, Albania was committed to the modernization of Navy fleets, both Navy and Coast Guard, since the old fleet was almost all out of service. In 2007, was signed a contracts with the Damen Group for the completing of the Coast Guard with Patrol vessels to be used to perform a number of tasks and duties, including coastal patrols, search and rescue, control and monitoring of maritime traffic, marine environment protection. The contract envisaged the construction of 4 vessels of the Damen Stan 4207 class, which the first of them would be built in Netherlands and 3 others in the Pasha Liman naval base in Albania. The first patrol vessel, named Iliria P-131, was built and delivered to the Albanian Coast Guard in August 2008. Enabling thus the following construction of 3 other patrol vessels in Pasha Liman Base by Albanian carpenters assisted by the experts of Damen Group. The second patrol vessel Oriku P-132 will be commissioned in September 2011, the third ship, Lisus P-133, will be operational in 2012 and fourth Butrint P-134 in 2013. The Stan Patrol 4207 is capable of operating away from its base for 14 days at a range of 1750 nautical miles. With the Albanian territorial waters consisting of 225 miles of coastline and extending 12 nautical miles from the shore, one Stan Patrol 4207 could conceivably patrol the entirety of Albania's territorial waters in one mission. Though its cruise speed is 12 knots, it is capable of attaining speeds of up to 30 knots, a speed that allows for pursuit of many other water craft. It is fairly large for a patrol boat, being just over 140 feet in length. While this size decreases maneuverability, it allows the craft to have outstanding handling characteristics on open water, thus making it useful for open-sea patrols that Albania may participate in under the auspices of NATO. This ship is also equipped with a deployable 7-meter Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) capable of carrying six individuals, a feature that could prove useful should the Albanian Navy or Coast Guard need to board a ship or pursue an intruder in waters requiring a high-maneuverability craft. Additionally, the Stan Patrol 4207 includes an on-board fire-fighting system, allowing the ship to double as both a patrol craft and an emergency response vehicle. Albania also benefits from the Navy's recent procurement of an advanced radar observation system that can transmit its images. This system certainly improves Albania's ability to defend its coastline by directing ships to potential trouble areas in Albanian coastal waters and beyond. Furthermore, through this improvement, Albania's prospects for serving as a security producer in the Adriatic Sea will be heightened due to NATO's intelligence-sharing programs.

She was educated in the schools of Indianapolis, and was married at an early age. Her husband died in 1869, leaving her with two children to support. In 1874, she began a successful career as a journalist, at first as correspondent and reporter for various newspapers, and later as editor. She was associate editor of the book entitled Eminent men of Indiana. In 1881, she became managing editor of the Washington World and was the founder, manager and editor of the National Veteran at Washington, D. C. She was actively identified with the National woman suffrage convention, the National Woman's Press Association, and the Society of American Authors. Her published writings, under the pseudonym \\"Emily Hawthorne,\\" include Hawthorne Blossoms (1876); and Lyrical Poems, Songs, Pastorals, War Poems, and Madrigals (1886). Charles favored woman's suffrage. Early years and family Emily Thornton was born in Lafayette, Indiana, March 21, 1845 She comes of English ancestors, the Thorntons and Parkers. On the paternal side, the Thorntons were noted as original thinkers. Her great-grandfather, Elisha Thornton, carried a sword in the American Revolutionary War. Her grandfather, also Elisha Thornton, resident of Sodus, New York, served in the War of 1812. Her father, James M. Thornton, served in the Union Army and died during the American Civil War in 1864, and of her two brothers, Charles lost his life in the Civil War. and Gardner served in Harrison's regiment. The Parkers, her maternal ancestors, were among the early Puritans. Deacon Edmund Parker settled in Reading, Massachusetts, about 1719, the family removing thereafter to Pepperell, Massachusetts, which town they helped to found. For more than a century, from father to son, the Parkers were deacons and leaders of the choir in the Congregational Church. When Emily's grandfather married, the couple took a wedding journey in a sleigh to find a new home in Lyons, New York, taking with them their household goods. Twenty years later, their daughter, Harriet Parker, was married to James M. Thornton, a civil engineer, son of Elisha. The young couple moved to Lafayette, where Mr. Thornton established a large manufactory. Emily Thornton was educated in the free schools of Indianapolis. As a child in school, she attracted attention by the excellence of her written exercises and her original manner of handling given subjects. Career At the age of 16, she became a teacher. She married, in 1861, Daniel B. Charles, son of a businessman long established in Indianapolis. At the age of 24, she was left a widow, in delicate health, with two young children dependent upon her. Hawthorn Blossoms (1876) Lyrical Poems, Songs, Pastorals, Roundelays, War Poems, Madrigals (1887) In 1874, she began to write for a livelihood, doing reporting and editorial work for Indianapolis papers and correspondence for outside publications. In 1876, she published her first volume of verse under the title Hawthorn Blossoms (Philadelphia). This book was received well and proved a literary and financial success. From 1876 to 1880, she continued to do newspaper work and biographical writing. She was associate editor of Eminent Men of Indiana. In 1881, she accepted a position as managing editor of the Washington World. Afterwards, she established The National Veteran in Washington, D. C., of which she was sole proprietor and editor. In 1883, because of overwork, she was confined to her bed for an entire year. While recovering slowly, she spent the year in revising and preparing for publication her later poems. The work appeared in Lyrical Poems, Songs, Pastorals, War Poems, and Madrigals (Philadelphia, 1886), a volume of 300 pages. That volume fully established her reputation as a national poet. She was a member of the executive committee of the National Woman's Press Association and chairman of the executive council of the Society of American Authors. Charles wrote almost exclusively under the name of \\"Emily Thornton\\", though \\"Emily Hawthorne\\" was also used. She appeared upon the lecture platform with success. On the occasion of her departure from Indiana, when a complimentary farewell testimonial was tendered her by the leading citizens of Indianapolis, in 1880, she made a brilliant address. In 1882, she addressed an audience of 1,500 ex-prisoners of war in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her poetical address on \\"Woman's Sphere\\" was delivered before a National Woman's Suffrage Convention. She was selected as one of the speakers at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She died in Washington City, where the latter part of her life was spent. She died April 25, 1895 in Washington DC, and was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery. \\"District of Columbia Deaths, 1874‚Äì1961,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F7RZ-KQ5 : accessed 4 October 2017), Emily Thornton Charles, 25 Apr 1895, District of Columbia, United States; citing reference ID 101693, District Records Center, Washington D.C.; FHL microfilm 2,135,981.

The northern part of the district, known as Grande Avenue Place Addition, was developed by several developers, including the Bevers. The people who lived here were middle and upper income households. Local business leaders and professional people lived alongside salesmen and railroad workers. The buildings are representative of various architectural styles and vernacular building forms popular from the 1890s through the 1930s. No known architect designed houses have been located here, but it is possible that local architect Charles Dieman had commissions here.

When the Grand Opera House opened in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for the first time on August 11, 1883, Carrington sang the title role in The Bohemian Girl. Early life and family Abbie Beeson was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, on June 13, 1856. She was the daughter of Edward Beeson (1815‚Äì1898), grandnephew of Henry Beeson, a Quaker who descended from English immigrants. Henry Beeson settled in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, founding Beesontown (later Uniontown, Pennsylvania). Henry and his wife Mary Beeson had 13 children, among whom John Beeson, Edward's father. John Beeson went to Ohio around 1802. When John Beeson had financial difficulties, he sent his children to live with relatives and friends. Edward returned home in 1829 and started an apprenticeship in Beaver, Pennsylvania to be a printer. He eventually bought the business and published the Beaver Republican, a paper with Democratic tendencies, supportive of Andrew Jackson. He also owned a sawmill at Green Bay, Wisconsin and after selling it, he bought a farm and settled in Wisconsin. Edward Beeson married Susan Emily Bell and had five children, among whom there was Abbie Beeson Carrington. Edward Beeson bought the Fond du Lac Journal, eventually becoming its editor and publisher. His son John founded the Fond du Lac Saturday Reporter. He died on December 16, 1898 in Fond du Lac. Career Abbie Carrington Abbie Beeson's musical talents showed themselves at an early age. In September 1875, she went to Boston and studied under J. H. Wheeler and Eben Tourj√©e, meanwhile singing in Temple street church. In 1887 she was graduated from the New England Conservatory. She then went to Italy, where she began the study of opera under Perenini and Giovanni, and after one year of study she made her debut in Milan, in La Traviata. In Cervia and Ravenna she won a triumph as Gilda Rigoletto. Subsequently, she sang in Dinorah and Lucia di Lammermoor. She was next engaged for a season of two months in Turin and for one month in Brescia; then she went to Venice to sing during the Carnival season. In 1879 she returned to the United States and sang in Milwaukee in April with the Mendelssohn Quartet Club. On October 7, 1879, in Boston, she sang with the Stakosch Opera Company. She next appeared in New York City with Theodore Thomas and the Philharmonic Society at the Steinway Hall. In January 1879, she made a tour of the main American cities, supported again by the Mendelssohn Quartet Club of Boston. In 1880‚Äì81 she made her first operatic tour with the C. D. Hess Grand Opera Company (also known as Strakosh-Hess Opera Company). In 1881‚Äì82 she was reengaged by Mr. Strakosch to sing on alternate nights with Etelka Gerster and Marie Roze. When the Grand Opera House opened in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for the first time on August 11, 1883, Carrington sang the title role in The Bohemian Girl. In 1883‚Äì84 Carrington visited Mexico and achieved so pronounced a success that in Vera Cruz, Orizaba, Pueblo, Monterey and the City of Mexico she received in writing the thanks of the municipality for the great pleasure she had given their people during her stay among them, and as a declaration of their esteem and appreciation made and presented her subscriptions to the amount of $31,000, to revisit them the following season with her own company. Carrington returned to the United States early in April, and immediately sailed for Europe at the solicitation of Manager Ernest Gye, of Covent Garden Theater, London. While there she secured some of the excellent talent that supported her during the following season, commencing in Richmond, Virginia, going directly South and to Mexico. During 1884/85 the Abbie Carrington Grand Opera Company proved to be one of the most successful of the organizations on the road. During 1885/86 Carrington reappeared in Italian opera with Her Majesty's Grand Opera Company. In 1887, after six consecutive seasons in grand opera, having sung the leading soprano roles in twenty different operas, Carrington took a much-needed rest, which resulted in opening a new sphere of work, and since that time she traveled only with her own company in concert and oratorio. The season of 1890‚Äì91, the most successful and extended of her career, was a tour of the Pacific Coast and British Columbia. Personal life Abbie Carrington, 1898 In 1872 Abbie Beeson married Adelbert P. Carrington (1869‚Äì1902), a man from Fond du Lac, a tinsmith who worked with her brother, Henry, and had one daughter, Mary Carrington (b. 1874) who married firstly A.L. Miller and secondly Emlyn Lewys (the son of Abbie's second husband). In March 1899 Beeson filed for divorce for nonsupport and cruelty. She said she supported her husband for twenty-five years on the revenue which she derived from the exercise of her talents in the vocal line. In 1900 she married Prof. Wilbert Lewys, director of the Virgil Practice Clavier musical schools of London and Berlin. Abbie Beeson Lewys died on April 8, 1925, in San Francisco, where she lived.

Nanoparticles measure less than 100 nanometers in at least one of their external dimensions, and are often engineered for their unique properties. Nanoparticles are unlike conventional chemicals in that their chemical composition and concentration are not sufficient metrics for a complete description, because they vary in other physical properties such as size, shape, surface properties, crystallinity, and dispersion state. Nanoparticles are characterized for various purposes, including nanotoxicology studies and exposure assessment in workplaces to assess their health and safety hazards, as well as manufacturing process control. There is a wide range of instrumentation to measure these properties, including microscopy and spectroscopy methods as well as particle counters. Metrology standards and reference materials for nanotechnology, while still a new discipline, are available from many organizations.  Background  Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale to create materials, devices, or systems with new properties or functions. It has potential applications in energy, healthcare, industry, communications, agriculture, consumer products, and other sectors. Nanoparticles measure less than 100 nanometers in at least one of their external dimensions, and often have properties different from the bulk versions of their component materials, which make them technologically useful. This article uses a broad definition of nanoparticles which includes all free nanomaterials regardless of their shape or how many of their dimensions are nanoscale, rather than the more restrictive ISO/TS 80004 definition that only refers to round nano-objects. Nanoparticles have different analytical requirements than conventional chemicals, for which chemical composition and concentration are sufficient metrics. Nanoparticles have other physical properties that must be measured for a complete description, such as size, shape, surface properties, crystallinity, and dispersion state. The bulk properties of nanoparticles are sensitive to small variations in these properties, which has implications for process control in their industrial use. These properties also influence the health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of a given composition. An additional challenge is that sampling and laboratory procedures can perturb the nanoparticles' dispersion state, or bias the distribution of their other properties. In environmental contexts, many methods cannot detect low concentrations of nanoparticles that may still have an adverse effect. A high background of natural and incidental nanoparticles may interfere with detection of the target engineered nanoparticle, as it is difficult to distinguish the two. Nanoparticles may also be mixed with larger particles. For some applications, nanoparticles may be characterized in complex matrices such as water, soil, food, polymers, inks, complex mixtures of organic liquids such as in cosmetics, or blood.  Types of methods  Microscopes such as this alt=A photograph of an electron microscope consisting of three white modules sitting on a desk ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectrophotometer can provide information about concentration, size, and shape.alt=Photograph of a UV-vis spetrophotometer consisting of two white boxes and a computer monitor on a desk Microscopy methods generate images of individual nanoparticles to characterize their shape, size, and location. Electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy are the dominant methods. Because nanoparticles have a size below the diffraction limit of visible light, conventional optical microscopy is not useful. Electron microscopes can be coupled to spectroscopic methods that can perform elemental analysis. Microscopy methods are destructive, and can be prone to undesirable artifacts from sample preparation such as drying or vacuum conditions required for some methods, or from probe tip geometry in the case of scanning probe microscopy. Additionally, microscopy is based on single-particle measurements, meaning that large numbers of individual particles must be characterized to estimate their bulk properties. A newer method, enhanced dark-field microscopy with hyperspectral imaging, shows promise for imaging nanoparticles in complex matrices such as biological tissue with higher contrast and throughput. Spectroscopy, which measures the particles' interaction with electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength, is useful for some classes of nanoparticles to characterize concentration, size, and shape. Semiconductor quantum dots are fluorescent and metal nanoparticles exhibit surface plasmon absorbances, making both amenable to ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy. Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray spectroscopy are also used with nanoparticles. Light scattering methods using laser light, X-rays, or neutron scattering are used to determine particle size, with each method suitable for different size ranges and particle compositions. Some miscellaneous methods are electrophoresis for surface charge, the Brunauer‚ÄìEmmett‚ÄìTeller method for surface area, and X-ray diffraction for crystal structure; as well as mass spectrometry for particle mass, and particle counters for particle number. Chromatography, centrifugation, and filtration techniques can be used to separate nanoparticles by size or other physical properties before or during characterization.  Metrics  = Size and dispersion = Nanoparticles with different alt=A photograph of five vials of liquid, each a different shade of red. Beneath each vial is a schematic showing the size of the particles in the vial, arranged from smallest to largest. Dispersion is the degree to which particles clump together into weakly bound agglomerates (pictured) or strongly bound aggregates.alt=An electron micrograph of spherical nanoparticles clumped together Particle size is the external dimensions of a particle, and dispersity is a measure of the range of particle sizes in a sample. If the particle is elongated or irregularly shaped, the size will differ between dimensions, although many measurement techniques yield an equivalent spherical diameter based on the surrogate property being measured. Size can be calculated from physical properties such as settling velocity, diffusion rate or coefficient, and electrical mobility. Size can also be calculated from microscope images using measured parameters such as Feret diameter, Martin diameter and projected area diameters; electron microscopy is often used for this purpose for nanoparticles. Size measurements may differ between methods because they measure different aspects of particle dimensions, they average distributions over an ensemble differently, or the preparation for or operation of the method may change the effective particle size. For airborne nanoparticles, techniques for measuring size include cascade impactors, electrical low-pressure impactors, mobility analyzers, and time-of-flight mass spectrometers. For nanoparticles in suspension, techniques include dynamic light scattering, laser diffraction, field flow fractionation, nanoparticle tracking analysis, particle tracking velocimetry, size exclusion chromatography, centrifugal sedimentation, and atomic force microscopy. For dry materials, techniques for measuring size include electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Back-calculation from surface area measurements are commonly employed, but these are subject to error for porous materials. Additional methods include hydrodynamic chromatography, static light scattering, multiangle light scattering, nephelometry, laser- induced breakdown detection, and ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy; as well as near-field scanning optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, capillary electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, cross-flow filtration, small- angle X-ray scattering, and differential mobility analysis. Use of an environmental scanning electron microscope avoids morphological changes caused by the vacuum required for standard scanning electron microscopy, at the cost of resolution. A closely related property is dispersion, a measure of the degree to which particles clump together into agglomerates or aggregates. While the two terms are often used interchangeably, according to ISO nanotechnology definitions, an agglomerate is a reversible collection of particles weakly bound, for example by van der Waals forces or physical entanglement, whereas an aggregate is composed of irreversibly bonded or fused particles, for example through covalent bonds. Dispersion is often assessed using the same techniques employed to determine size distribution, and the width of a particle size distribution is often used as a surrogate for dispersion. Dispersion is a dynamic process strongly affected by properties of the particles themselves as well as their environment such as pH and ionic strength. Some methods have difficulty distinguishing between a single large particle and a set of smaller agglomerated or aggregated particles; in this case using multiple sizing methods can help resolve the ambiguity, with microscopy being particularly useful. = Shape = alt=An electron micrograph of a star-shaped nanoparticle Morphology refers to the physical shape of a particle, as well as its surface topography, for example, the presence of cracks, ridges, or pores. Morphology influences dispersion, functionality, and toxicity, and has similar considerations as size measurements. Evaluation of morphology requires direct visualization of the particles through techniques like scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Several metrics can be used, such as sphericity or circularity, aspect ratio, elongation, convexity, and fractal dimension. Because microscopy involves measurements of single particles, a large sample size is necessary to ensure a representative sample, and orientation and sample preparation effects must be accounted for. = Chemical composition and crystal structure = The atoms in a nanoparticle may be arranged in a alt=Top, schematic of a crystalline solid showing circular particles in a regular hexagonal lattice. Bottom, schematic of an amorphous solid showing circular particles in a disordered arrangement. Bulk chemical composition refers to the atomic elements of which a nanoparticle is composed, and can be measured in ensemble or single-particle elemental analysis methods. Ensemble techniques include atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, neutron activation analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and thermogravimetric analysis. Single-particle techniques include time-of-flight mass spectrometry, as well as utilizing elemental detectors such as energy- dispersive X-ray analysis or electron energy loss spectroscopy while using scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. The arrangement of elemental atoms in a nanoparticles may be organized into a crystal structure or may be amorphous. Crystallinity is the ratio of crystalline to amorphous structure. Crystallite size, the size of the crystal unit cell, can be calculated through the Scherrer equation. Generally, crystal structure is determined using powder X-ray diffraction, or selected area electron diffraction using a transmission electron microscope, though others such as Raman spectroscopy exist. X-ray diffraction requires on the order of a gram of material, whereas electron diffraction can be done on single particles. = Surface area = Surface area is an important metric for engineered nanoparticles because it influences reactivity and surface interactions with ligands. Specific surface area refers to the surface area of a powder normalized to mass or volume. Different methods measure different aspects of surface area. Direct measurement of nanoparticle surface area utilizes adsorption of an inert gas such as nitrogen or krypton under varying conditions of pressure to form a monolayer of gas coverage. The number of gas molecules needed to form a monolayer and the cross-sectional area of the adsorbate gas molecule are related to the \\"total surface area\\" of the particle, including internal pores and crevices, using the Brunauer‚ÄìEmmett‚ÄìTeller equation. Organic molecules can be used in place of gasses, such as ethylene glycol monoethyl ether. There are several indirect measurement techniques for airborne nanoparticles, which do not account for porosity and other surface irregularities and therefore may be inaccurate. Real-time diffusion chargers measure the \\"active surface area\\", the area of the particle that interacts with the surrounding gas or ions and is accessible only from the outside. Electrical mobility analyzers calculate the spherical equivalent diameter, which can be converted using geometric relationships. These methods cannot discriminate a nanoparticle of interest from incidental nanoparticles that may occur in complex environments such as workplace atmospheres. Nanoparticles can be collected onto a substrate and their external dimensions can be measured using electron microscopy, then converted to surface area using geometric relations. = Surface chemistry and charge = alt=A 3D computer-generated atomic model of a spherical nanoparticle with long-chain molecules attached to its surface Surface chemistry refers to the elemental or molecular chemistry of particle surfaces. No formal definition exists for what constitutes a surface layer, which is usually defined by the measurement technique employed. For nanoparticles a higher proportion of atoms are on their surfaces relative to micron-scale particles, and surface atoms are in direct contact with solvents and influence their interactions with other molecules. Some nanoparticles such as quantum dots may have a core‚Äìshell structure where the outer surface atoms are different than those of the interior core. Multiple techniques are available to characterize nanoparticle surface chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy are well-suited to characterizing a thicker surface layer of 1‚Äì5 nm. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy is more useful to characterize just the top few angstroms (10 angstroms = 1 nm), and can be used with sputtering techniques to analyze chemistry as a function of depth. Surface chemistry measurements are particularly sensitive to contamination on particle surfaces, making quantitative analyses difficult, and spatial resolution can be poor. For adsorbed proteins, radiolabelling or mass spectrometry methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) can be used. Surface charge generally refers to the charge from adsorption or desorption of protons on hydroxylated sites on a nanoparticle surface. Surface charge is difficult to directly measure, so the related zeta potential is often measured instead, which is the potential at the double layer's slipping plane, which separates mobile solvent molecules from those that remain attached to the surface. Zeta potential is a calculated rather than measured property, and is a function of both the nanoparticle of interest and its surrounding medium, requiring a description of the measurement temperature; the composition, pH, viscosity, and dielectric constant of the medium; and value used for the Henry function to be meaningful. Zeta potential is used as an indicator of colloidal stability, and has been shown to be predictive of nanoparticle uptake by cells. Zeta potential can be measured by titration to find the isoelectric point, or through electrophoresis including laser Doppler electrophoresis. Surface energy or wettability are also important for nanoparticle aggregation, dissolution, and bioaccumulation. They can be measured through heat of immersion microcalorimetry studies, or through contact angle measurements. Surface reactivity can also be directly monitored through microcalorimetry using probe molecules that undergo measurable changes. = Solubility = Solubility is a measurement of the degree to which material dissolves from a nanoparticle to enter solution. Material dissolved as part of a solubiity test can be quantified using atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, with the last being generally the most sensitive. Two related concepts are biodurability, the rate of dissolution in a biological fluid or surrogate, and biopersistence, the rate at which a material is cleared from an organ such as the lung by physical and chemical dissolution processes. Analytical techniques for solubility quantitatively measure total elemental concentration in a sample, and do not discriminate between dissolved or solid forms. Therefore, a separation process must be used to remove the remaining particles. Physical separation techniques include size exclusion chromatography, hydrodynamic chromatography and field flow fractionation. Mechanical separation techniques utilize membranes and/or centrifugation. Chemical separation techniques are liquid‚Äìliquid extraction, solid‚Äìliquid extraction, cloud point extraction, and the use of magnetic nanoparticles.  Applications  = Product verification = Scanning electron microscope images of four samples of zinc oxide nanoparticles from different vendors, showing differences in size and shape. Characterization of nanomaterials by manufacturers and users is important in assessing the uniformity and reproducibility of their properties. Manufacturers and users of nanoparticles may perform characterization of their products for process control or verification and validation purposes. The properties of nanoparticles are sensitive to small variations in the processes used to synthesize and process them. Thus, nanoparticles prepared by seemingly identical processes must be characterized to determine if they are actually equivalent. Any material or dimensional property of a nanomaterial can be heterogeneous, and these can lead to heterogeneity in their functional properties. Generally, uniform collections are desired. It is advantageous to minimize heterogeneity during the initial synthesis, stabilization, and functionalization processes, rather than through downstream purification steps that decrease yield. Batch-to-batch reproducibility is also desirable. Unlike research-oriented nanometrology, industrial measurements emphasize reducing time, cost, and number of measured metrics, and must be performed under ambient conditions during a production process. Different applications have different tolerances for uniformity and reproducibility, and require different approaches to characterization. For example, nanocomposite materials may be tolerant of a broad distribution of nanoparticle properties. By contrast, characterization is especially important for nanomedicines, as their efficacy and safety depends strongly on critical properties such as particle size distribution, chemical composition, and the kinetics of drug loading and release. The development of standardized analytical methods for nanomedicines is in its early stages. However, standardized lists of recommended tests called \\"assay cascades‚Äù have been developed to assist with this. = Toxicology = Nanotoxicology is the study of the toxic effects of nanoparticles on living organisms. Characterization of a nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties is important for ensuring the reproducibility of toxicology studies, and is also vital for studying how the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles determine their biological effects. The properties of a nanoparticle, such as size distribution and agglomeration state, can change as a material is prepared and used in toxicology studies. This makes it important to measure them at different points in the experiment. The \\"as-received\\" or \\"as-generated\\" properties refer to the material's state when received from the manufacturer or synthesized in the laboratory. The \\"as-dosed\\" or \\"as-exposed\\" properties refer to its state when administered to the biological system. These may differ from the \\"as-received\\" state due to formation of aggregates and agglomerates if the material has been in powder form, the settling out of larger aggregates and agglomerates, or loss by adhesion to surfaces. The properties may again be different at the point of interaction with the organism's tissues due to biodistribution and physiological clearance mechanisms. At this stage, it is difficult to measure nanoparticle properties in situ without perturbing the system. Post mortem or histological examination provides a way to measure these changes in the material, although the tissue itself can interfere with the measurements. = Exposure assessment = Equipment used for area sampling of airborne nanoparticles. The instruments shown here include a condensation particle counter (left), aerosol photometer (blue device at top), and two air sampling pumps for filter-based analysis. Exposure assessment is a set of methods used to monitor contaminant release and exposures to workers and mitigate the health and safety hazards of nanomaterials in workplaces where they are handled. For engineered nanoparticles, the assessment often involves use of both real-time instruments such as particle counters, which monitor the total number of particles in air (including both the nanoparticle of interest and other background particles), and filter-based occupational hygiene sampling methods that use electron microscopy and elemental analysis to identify the nanoparticle of interest. Personal sampling locates the samplers in the personal breathing zone of the worker, as close to the nose and mouth as possible and usually attached to a shirt collar. Area sampling is where samplers are placed at static locations. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Nanomaterial Exposure Assessment Technique (NEAT) 2.0 is a sampling strategy that can be used to determine exposure potential for engineered nanoparticles. The NEAT 2.0 approach uses filter samples both in the worker's personal breathing zone and as area samples. Separate filter samples are used for elemental analysis, and to gather morphologic data from electron microscopy. The latter can provide an order of magnitude evaluation of the contribution of the nanoparticle of interest to the elemental mass load, as well as a qualitative assessment of the particle size, degree of agglomeration, and whether the nanoparticle is free or contained within a matrix. Hazard identification and characterization can then be performed based on a holistic assessment of the integrated filter samples. In addition, field-portable direct reading instruments can be used for continuous recording of normal fluctuations in particle count, size distribution, and mass. By documenting the workers' activities, data-logged results can then be used to identify workplace tasks or practices that contribute to any increase or spikes in the counts. The data need to be carefully interpreted, as direct reading instruments will identify the real-time quantity of all nanoparticles including any incidental background particles such as may occur from motor exhaust, pump exhaust, heating vessels, and other sources. Evaluation of worker practices, ventilation efficacy, and other engineering exposure control systems and risk management strategies serve to allow for a comprehensive exposure assessment. To be effective, real-time particle counters should be able to detect a wide range of particle sizes, as nanoparticles may aggregate in the air. Adjacent work areas can be simultaneously tested to establish a background concentration. Not all instruments used to detect aerosols are suitable for monitoring occupational nanoparticle emissions because they may not be able to detect smaller particles, or may be too large or difficult to ship to a workplace. Some NIOSH methods developed for other chemicals can be used for off-line analysis of nanoparticles, including their morphology and geometry, elemental carbon content (relevant for carbon-based nanoparticles), and elemental analysis for several metals. Occupational exposure limits have not yet been developed for many of the large and growing number of engineered nanoparticles now being produced and used, as their hazards are not fully known. While mass-based metrics are traditionally used to characterize toxicological effects of exposure to air contaminants, it remains unclear which metrics are most important with regard to engineered nanoparticles. Animal and cell-culture studies have shown that size and shape may be two major factors in their toxicological effects. Surface area and surface chemistry also appear to be more important than mass concentration. NIOSH has determined non-regulatory recommended exposure limits (RELs) of 1.0 Œºg/m3 for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers as background-corrected elemental carbon as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) respirable mass concentration, and 300 Œºg/m3 for ultrafine titanium dioxide as TWA concentrations for up to 10 hr/day during a 40-hour work week.  Standards  Metrology standards for nanotechnology are available from both private organizations and government agencies. These include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International, the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory, and the European Committee for Standardization. The American National Standards Institute maintains a database of nanotechnology standards. = Reference materials = Transmission electron micrograph of titanium dioxide nanoparticles from NIST Standard Reference Material 1898alt=An electron micrograph of nanoparticles, all about the same size Reference materials are materials that are established or produced to be homogeneous and stable in at least one measurable physical property to provide a control measurement. Reference materials for nanoparticles can reduce measurement error that can contribute to uncertainty in their hazard properties in risk assessment. Reference materials can also be used for calibrating equipment used in nanoparticles characterization, for statistical quality control, and for comparing experiments run in different laboratories. Many nanoparticles do not yet have reference materials available. Nanoparticles have the challenge that reference materials can only be generated when the measurement methods themselves can produce precise and reproducible measurements of the relevant physical property. Measurement conditions must also be specified, because properties such as size and dispersion state may change based on them, especially when there is a thermodynamic equilibrium between particlulate and dissolved matter. Reference materials of nanoparticles often have a shorter validity period than other materials. Those in powder form are more stable than those provided in suspensions, but the process of dispersing the powder increases uncertainty in its metrics. Reference nanoparticles are produced by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as the European Union Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the Canadian National Research Council, the Chinese National Institute of Metrology, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. The German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing maintains a listing of nanoscale reference materials.

With his height, which enumerated 1.97 meters high at the time, he was known for being the tallest layer in the S.League in his time; he was also known for his goalscoring talent. Career =Reunion= Aged 20, the Senegalese striker signed for FC Bourges, a team that oscillated between the French second and third divisions at the time. Then, Boucher moved to Vierzon FC, a club within the French fourth tier. Following a one-year spell at Kaizer Chiefs, Boucher was contacted by an agent who offered him a club in Reunion, US Possession where he scored 18 goals on average each season. =S.League= After spending four seasons with US Possession, he trialed with Tiong Bahru F.C. at the end of 1996. Dutch coach Robert Alberts decided to sign the then 28-year old, who responded with 5 goals in 4 games and double figures by the end of the season. Soon, however, the forward returned to Reunion Island for \\"personal reasons\\" in 1998. Eventually, Tohari Paijan, the new Tanjong Pagar United coach, went to Reunion Island which induced Boucher to return mid- season. Throughout the remainder of the season, he scored 11 goals which catapulted the Jaguars to a Singapore Cup and Singapore FA Cup double. In 1999, Boucher rejoined US Possession but returned to Tanjong Pagar and formed a so-called 'Twin Tower' attacking partnership with countryman Boubacar Seck, scoring 11 goals in 13 appearances. However, his time at Tanjong Pagar would be hampered by a fight with Warriors FC player Tan Kim Leng which led to one- year ban from playing in Sinagpore. Instead, the attacker was snapped up by SS Saint-Louisienne, winning the 2001 and 2002 Reunion Premier League titles as well as participating in the 2002 and 2003 CAF Champions League campaigns with the club. At the age of 37, Boucher made one final return to Tanjong Pagar,https://www.clicanoo.re/node/415342 netting one goal. On account of knee injury, he was released after a few months and spent some time recovering, followed by a four-season spell with AC Excelsior.

She was a star attraction of the Australian stage in Sydney during the 1830s, dubbed ‚Äòthe Queen of the Sydney stage‚Äô, and became known to the audience of Calcutta in India under the stage name Madame Dhermainville. Life Maria Taylor was born to the actors Eliza Atkins and James Hill, and was educated in acting by a ‚ÄòDrury Lane education‚Äô on the London stage. She arrived in Hobart in Tasmania in 1833. She made a success when she sang at a concert at the Hobart Courthouse, and was engaged at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, later the same year. =Career in Sydney= During her nine year's long career in Sydney, Taylor became known as ‚Äòthe Queen of the Sydney stage‚Äô, and played most of the most prestigious roles performed in Sydney at that time at both the Theatre Royal and Royal Victoria Theatre, among them being Romeo to Eliza Winstanley‚Äôs Juliet in 1835. Sydney critics described her as ‚Äòa pleasing lively little brunette, with a sparkling and expressive black eye, not particularly pretty, but far from plain', in possession of a ‚Äòdesirable stature of person, neither diminutive nor masculine ‚Äì the graceful air of step ‚Äì and the clear, distinct enunciation of voice‚Äô and ‚ÄòOne so lady like in her manner is indeed a rarity in this part of the world‚Äô; as an artist she was called elastic, versatile and natural in her performance style: :‚ÄòMrs. Taylor is here quite unrivaled as an actress; as the versatility of her genius in such opposite characters as Don Giovanni and Mrs. Haller ‚Ä¶ and many other characters of an equally opposite nature, can fully testify‚Äô, and: :‚Äò‚Ä¶it was the perfect manner in which Mrs. Taylor inhaled the spirit of the part that caused her to give so much satisfaction; her ease, vivacity, playful humour, then her deep emotion ‚Äì were all evinced with the nicest discrimination; it was all emphatically natural‚Ä¶‚ÄôJane Woollard: The elasticity of her spirits‚Äô: Actresses and resilience on the 19th century colonial stage Alongside Ellen Douglass Hatch (1812‚Äì1838) whose career was parallel with hers and who was described by the Sydney Gazette of November 1834 as an actress of ‚Äòsuperior theatrical attainments‚Äô, Taylor was arguably the most noted actress in Sydney in the 1830s. =Private life= Taylor was also known for the scandals surrounding her private life. After her spouse abandoned her and their child in 1834, she had a number of affairs, which attracted attention in the press. She defended herself in the press and was condemned by moral conservatives such as Reverend Dr. Lang and his followers. In 1836, she had a relationship with the con artist John Thomas Wilson. Wilson seduced and abandoned a Mrs. Cavill, whose brother Andrew Wyllie retaliated by accusing Wilson to consort with prostitutes, accusing Taylor of being one of them, which resulted in Taylor publicly accuse Andrew Wyllie in the press for slander. In 1839, she entered into a relationship with the French sea captain and swindler Pierre Largeteau. When Largeteau unlawfully sold the ship Ville de Bordeaux without being its owner in July 1840, Taylor left with him on his flight to Calcutta. =Calcutta= In Calcutta, Taylor and Largeteau took the names Count and Madame Dhermainville and lived a life of luxury, presenting herself as a French actress married into nobility. The whole affair became a sensation in French, English and colonial press. When Pierre Largeteau contracted cholera and died in 1841, she returned to acting and made her Calcutta debut in The Taming of the Shrew at the Sans Souci Theatre of Esther Leach. At this time, she was in a relationship with Captain George Hamilton Cox, Secretary of the Fire Insurance Company, an affair which attracted attention, particularly as he committed suicide in April 1841. Taylor herself died of cholera in May 1841. =Legacy= The Sydney press wrote: :\\"As an actress this lady was more successful than any other that ever trod the Sydney boards. The versatility of her talent and the elasticity of her spirits knew no bounds. In private life, whatever indiscretions she might have been guilty of, were rather the result of a volatile and giddy disposition, inseparable from her professional pursuits, than of a bad heart.\\"Jane Woollard: The elasticity of her spirits‚Äô: Actresses and resilience on the 19th century colonial stage References * Jane Woollard: The elasticity of her spirits‚Äô: Actresses and resilience on the 19th century colonial stage * Resilience: Revive, Restore, Reconnect, Australasian Association for Drama Theatre and Performance Studies (ADSA) 2016 Conference Proceedings, Volume 1, ed.

It is based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". The film stars Keith Carradine, who also served as Executive Producer. The film premiered at the Wine Country Film Festival in 2014. Plot Wealthy wine maker Jonathan Bragg (Keith Carradine) hires Tuscan wine detective Victor Borgo (Gaetano Guarino) to find the source of a mysterious bottle of wine, the \\"Oroboros\\". As Borgo follows the twisted, perilous trail, he descends deeper into an arcane Tuscan underworld, encountering an earth- worshiping wine cult and the dark side of human nature. Jopson's screenplay brings Poe's short story \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" into contemporary times and sets it the underworld of the Tuscan wine buinsess. With references to Brunellopoli, the great Italian wine scandal of 2008 and with cameo appearances from real-world winemakers such as Salvatore Ferragamo and Luca Sanjust, the film brings a level of authenticity when it comes to the wine business. In a nod to Poe's short story, in addition to the wine theme, Terroir features Masonic references and symbols as well as a terrifying scene in a wine cellar. Terroir takes its name from the wine industry term terroir, which indicates that the natural environment in which a particular wine is produced affects the outcome, and thus the taste, including factors such as soil, topography, and climate. Together these elements determine the character of wine. Release =Premiere= \\"Terroir\\" had its world premiere on September 20, 2014 at the Wine Country Film Festival in Sonoma Valley, California. The film was presented \\"al fresco\\" at a specially built outdoor theater in the vineyards of Deerfield Ranch with a 33-foot Cinemascope screen and a Dolby 5.1 sound system. The festivities included a tribute to Keith Carradine and a screening of his 1977 film The Duellists. As part of his personal appearance Carradine performed his Academy Award winning song \\"I'm Easy\\" from the movie Nashville. =Video on demand= \\"Terroir\\" was released on Amazon.com in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on August 16, 2017. =Critical response= Poe scholar John Gruesser, in his review of Terroir wrote, \\"Stunningly beautiful in several places, with gorgeous shots of its Tuscan setting, Terroir evokes \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" both explicitly and subtly, which should delight Poe fans. Speaking in voice- over at times, Bragg, the Montresor character (played by a terrific Keith Carradine), succeeds in leading Borgo, the Fortunato character, to his doom. He accomplishes this by exploiting his victim‚Äôs weak point (wine connoisseurship), even mentioning Luchesi at times to do so. Like Poe‚Äôs story, the film deftly uses masonic symbols, Latin phrases, a coat of arms, and a family motto.\\" Stephen Ashton, in his review for the Wine Country Film Festival wrote, \\"Filmed in some of Tuscany‚Äôs most scenic wine estates Terroir features authentic wine-making traditions, sensual cinematography, and occult rituals derived from the secret rites of real-life erotic cults.

As its name suggests, BIK1 is only active after being induced by Botrytis infection. When Botrytis cinerea is present, the BIK1 gene is transcribed so that the kinase is present to defend the cell. BIK1 functions to regulate the amount of salicylic acid (SA) present in the cell. When Botrytis cinerea or Alternaria brassicicola or any other necrotrophic pathogen is present, BIK1 is transcribed to regulate the pathogen response mechanisms. When BIK1 is present, SA levels decrease, allowing the nectrotrophic response to take place. When nectrotrophic pathogens are not present, BIK1 is not transcribed and SA levels increase, limiting the necrotrophic resistance pathway. Only the pathogenic defense response that is initiated by BIK1 is dependent on SA levels. Non-pathogenic cellular functions occur independently. In terms of non-pathogenic cellular functions, BIK1 is described as a critical component of ET signaling and PAMP- triggered immunity to pathogens. Functions of BIK1 For cellular processes that are not directly related to pathogen resistance or defense, BIK1 does not utilize traditional defense-mediating hormones such as SA, JA, or ACC, but instead utilizes an herbicide, known as paraquat which produces ROIs. It is believed that SA, JA, and ACC have no effect on BIK1 induction because they are likely located downstream from the BIK1 gene, or it is possible that BIK1 operates completely independently. However, it is believed that BIK1 does play a vital role in the ET signaling pathway. Based on the signaling function of BIK1 in ET responses, it is believed that Botrytis-induced kinase1 accumulates response signals that it receives from upstream regulators and then integrates them into its own resistance mechanism. BIK1 is a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) that associates with a cell-surface receptor, FLS2, and a co- receptor kinase, BAK1 to transduce signals when a PAMP is detected. In order for BIK1 to be activated, site-specific phosphorylation must occur. Effects of Phosphorylation on BIK1 Function Because BIK1 is a possible regulator of the FLS2-BAK1 complex, it is speculated that in vitro, BAK1 phosphorylates BIK1, which then phosphorylates both FLS2 and BAK1. However, in vivo, BIK1 is not phosphorylated until about 5-10 minutes after the addition of FS2, and the peak phosphorylation occurs just after the phosphorylation of the FS2-BAK1 complex. It is speculated that BIK1 activation might be enhanced through transphosphorylation by BAK1 rather than by FLS2 because FLS2 more likely serves as a scaffold protein for the arrangement of the BAK1-FLS2 complex. This hypothesis will require more testing in vivo. Research has shown that BIK1 and BAK1 are signaling partners for the flagellin receptor FLS2 and that the three together initiate defense response. However, BIK1 and BAK1 phosphorylate different residues of the FLS2 receptor with the exception of only a select few. This suggests that both BAK1 and BIK1 play unique roles in defense response by a series of phosphorylation reactions with one another and the flagellin receptor FLS2. BIK1 affect on Plant Growth and Development Root systems in plants with an expressed BIK1 gene and in plants with a loss- of-function mutant show that without an expressed BIK1 gene, roots grow more laterally, in greater numbers, and with shorter primary roots. With a functional BIK1 gene, roots grew downward into the soil and had less root hairs. Additionally, without a functional BIK1 gene, leaves showed serrated edges and considerable wrinkles whereas leaves with a functional BIK1 gene showed stronger, smoother leaves. Flowering plants that lack a functional BIK1 gene flower an average of six days before those with a functional BIK1 gene and show weaker stem strengths, reduced fertility, and smaller siliques. The BIK1 protein contributes to overall stronger stems, broader leaves, and a healthy flowering timeline. Plants lacking a BIK1 protein or that have a BIK1 protein whose functions are being inhibited may exhibit a shorter flowering period and a smaller stature for the plant overall. This suggests that BIK1 plays a significant role in a plant's ability to grow properly as well as its ability to maintain an adequate rigidity and stem strength that contribute to overall plant health. Research Current research regarding Botrytis-induced kinase1 aims to determine how BIK1 interacts with MAPK pathway proteins as well as with the OXI1 kinase. Also, studies are being conducted to determine the relationship between BIK1 and the phosphorylizing homolog kinases PEPR1 and PEPR2. Though it is believed that PEPR1 and PEPR2 act as enzymes toward BIK1 and phosphorylate the kinase, research is still being done to examine the effects of the interaction on a broader scale. Previously published research suggests that PEPR1 and PEPR2 work with the ET signal pathway and Botrytis- induced kinase1 in order to amplify the defense mechanism in immune response. Additionally, future research may explore the mechanism that allows BIK1 and BAK1 to cooperate with the FLS2 receptor to initiate defense response. While it is known that the three work together and each is required for the process to occur efficiently, but the exact relationship between the three remains unknown and the specific binding residues for each component have yet to be determined in vivo.

Geminus is best known as Galba's appointment as Urban prefect of Rome during the Year of Four Emperors.Tacitus, Histories, I.14 Geminus had family connections with Patavium; he is one of three consular Ducenii that Ronald Syme identifies as a native of that town. The other two are Gaius Ducenius Proculus, consul in 87, and Publius Ducenius Verus, consul in 96.Syme, \\"Eight Consuls from Patavium\\", Papers of the British School at Rome, 51 (1983), p. 103  Life  Most of Geminus' career is known from an acephalic inscription (one where the name of the subject is missing) recovered from Epidaurus in Greece; Werner Eck has argued that the subject of this inscription is Geminus.\\"Miscellanea prosopographica\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 42 (1981), pp. 229f The earliest office found on this inscription is that of quaestor, assigned to the province of Crete and Cyrenaica; the office of quaestor qualified Geminus for admission to the Roman Senate. Next is the traditional republican magistracy of plebeian tribune, after which there is a gap in the inscription. It can be assumed he was praetor, since Geminus had acceded to suffect consul. The date of his consulate is variously given. The older authorities follow Edmund Groag's argument that Geminus was suffect consul in AD 54 or 55. However, Eck has more recently shown that a nundinium in either year 60 or 61 is more likely. Syme endorses the years 60 or 61, and builds on it the hypothesis that Geminus may owe his appointment to the consulate to Lucius Vitellius, one of Nero's comites, just as had Titus Clodius Eprius Marcellus and Lucius Junius Quintus Vibius Crispus.Syme, \\"Eight Consuls\\", p. 112 Nevertheless, either date would fit the next known office: in the year 62 the emperor Nero appointed Geminus, along with Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Aulus Pompeius Paulinus, to a commission to manage the public revenues.Tacitus, Annales, XV.18 According to the inscription from Epidurus, after stepping down from the consulate Geminus became a member of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, one of the four most prestigious priesthoods of ancient Rome, and the sodales Augustales. He was also appointed governor of Dalmatia, and was commissioned to lead a military expedition into Illyria; Syme dates his governorship prior to the year 69. Galba appointed Geminus as the replacement for Titus Flavius Sabinus as Urban prefect. Tacitus mentions Geminus' presence at the meeting when Galba announced on 10 January 69 that he would make Lucius Calpurnius Piso his heir.Tacitus, Histories I.14 Gwyn Morgan suspects Galba's motivation was to keep the urban cohorts in control by a trusted associate.Morgan, 69 A.D. The Year of Four Emperors (Oxford: University Press, 2006), p. 50 Syme, on the other hand, suspected the influence of someone in Galba's entourage. \\"Perhaps friends of Thrasea Paetus now coming back from exile,\\" Syme writes. \\"Or, for that matter, the consular Silius Italicus should not too readily be discounted, despite his recent and questionable activities.\\"Syme, \\"Eight Consuls\\", p. 113 Following the assassination of Galba and the ascension of Otho as emperor, Geminus lost his office and Flavius Sabinus was restored.Tacitus, Histories, I.46 Geminus somehow survived the chaos of that year. The inscription from Epidurus and a second from Philadelphia both attest that he was proconsular governor of Asia. While older authorities who follow Groag's dating for Geminus' consulate date his tenure as governor to 68/69, Eck's more recent investigation supports a date of 73/74 as governor of Asia.Judith Ginsburg, \\"Nero's Consular Policy\\", American Journal of Ancient History 6 (1981), p. 68 n. 54 His life after this governorship is so far unknown; as he was at least in his fifties when he concluded his proconsular office, Geminus might have died soon afterwards.

Life Julie Vieusseux was born in the Netherlands to the Belgian army captain Louis Emile Matthieu and Catherine van de Winkle. She was educated in Paris. In 1849, she married the English civil engineer, architect and surveyor Lewis Vieusseux. Both were of French Huguenot descent. In 1852, she emigrated with her spouse, two sons and her sister to Melbourne in Australia. Vieusseux established herself as a painter the same year of her arrival in Australia. While her spouse departed for the gold fields, she exhibited her paintings. At the third Victorian Industrial Society Exhibition held in December 1852, Vieusseux was decorated for her art. In 1857, Vieusseux founded the Vieusseux Ladies‚Äô College. Her school swiftly became a highly fashionable establishment, were the upper classes enrolled their daughters. In 1863, the school had 103 students, an unusually high number for a contemporary Australian school for girls.

It is the largest recorded surface rupture event to have occurred in the North China Plain. The epicenter was located approximately east of the Imperial Palace in Beijing. Earthquake The earthquake struck sometime between 9am and 11am on Saturday, September 2, 1679 and had its epicenter in Sanhe, modern day Hebei Province. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.0 and ruptured along most of the Xiadian Fault's length. The strike-slip earthquake was located at a depth of and was the largest known earthquake to have occurred in the North China Plain. Impact The 1679 earthquake was most devastating for the towns of Sanhe and Pinggu, east of Beijing. In these two towns, intensity is estimated to have reached X (extreme) while in Beijing the intensity reached VIII (severe). Sanhe was virtually destroyed while in Pinggu only between 30‚Äì40% households survived. Many buildings and structures in Beijing were also damaged or destroyed. The Qing Dynasty White Pagoda in Beihai Park and Desheng Gate were both destroyed. The Kangxi Emperor survived the quake, but many officials and citizens in Beijing were killed. While the total number of fatalities is unknown, it is estimated that upwards of 45,500 were killed by the quake. The earthquake was felt as far west as Gansu Province and as far northeast as Liaoning Province. Future threat While the Xiadian Fault is still active and poses a potential threat to the Greater Beijing region, earthquakes of this magnitude are predicted to occur only every 6,500 years along the slow moving fault. Other similar faults, however, exist in the Beijing region and are not properly understood. On average, a major earthquake is predicted to occur in the North China Plain every 300 years, most recently with the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. A 2007 study by Risk Management Solutions found that an earthquake similar in size to the 1679 Sanhe-Pinggu event could have devastating effects and result in the deaths of between 35,000 and 75,000 people. In addition, economic impacts at that time were estimated to be 445 billion RMB (c. $57 billion).

Wildwood, 1866. Sally St. Clair (St. Clare) was an American woman from South Carolina who disguised herself as a man and joined the Continental Army. Her true gender was not discovered until after she was killed in battle during the Siege of Savannah in 1782. Little is known about St. Clair. She is variously described as a Creole woman, a woman of color, and a woman of African and French descent. By some accounts she joined the army to be with her lover, a sergeant. She may have served as a gunner. Several sources claim she was killed during the Battle of Savannah in 1778. \\"Romantic Victorians\\" such as George Pope Morris claimed that even her lover did not recognize her until after she was killed and her body was prepared for burial. Morris's poem about St. Clair begins: In the ranks of Marion's band, Through morass and wooded land, Over beach of yellow sand, Mountain, plain and valley; A southern maid, in all her pride, March'd gayly at her lover's side, In such disguise That e'en his eyes Did not discover Sally. Morris describes St. Clair as a \\"beautiful, dark-eyed Creole girl\\" with \\"long, jetty ringlets,\\" and claims that she died of a lance thrust aimed at her lover, Sergeant Jasper. He goes on to say that \\"there was not a dry eye in the corps when Sally St. Clair was laid in her grave, near the River Santee, in a green shady nook that looked as if it had been stolen out of Paradise.\\" Warren Wildwood tells her story in similarly picturesque terms in Thrilling Adventures Among the Early Settlers (1866).

She is best known for her work studying Doggerland, an area of land now submerged beneath the North Sea. Early life and education Coles was born on 12 August 1946 to John Samuel Orme and Jean Esther Orme (n√©e Harris). She studied at Bristol University before completing her postgraduate degree at the London Institute of Archaeology and completing an MPhil in Anthropology at University College London. Academic career Coles became a lecturer in prehistoric archaeology at the University of Exeter in 1972. She was promoted to Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology in 1996: when she retired in 2008 she was appointed Professor Emeritus. Her work studying Doggerland began in the 1990s. Coles named Doggerland after Dogger Bank, a large sandbank in the southern North Sea. In 1998, Coles produced hypothetical maps of the area. As well as research into Doggerland, Coles has also done extensive research into wetland archaeology, particularly in the Somerset Levels alongside her husband, John Coles. Their work with the Somerset Levels Project resulted in the establishment of a new branch of archaeology focusing on wetlands and in 1998, they received the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge. Coles began also studying the European beaver after realising that a series of distinctive marks on preserved wood found in the Somerset Levels were made by beavers and not humans as first assumed. She mapped out the activities of beavers in Brittany for around 5 years so that she could learn how to see signs of beavers in the environment and to help differentiate between beaver and human activity in any future archaeological sites. Personal life Coles, along with her late husband John, who was also an archaeologist, established The John and Bryony Coles Bursary in 1998. The bursary was created to help students who are travelling outside of their own country to study or work in prehistoric archaeology. Honours On 27 November 1975, Coles was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 2007, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

Shanghai No.2 High School's sister schools are Needham High School in Boston and Wittelsbacher- Realschule Aichach in Germany.  History  Shanghai No.2 High School, formerly Wu Pen Girls' School, was established by Wu Xin in 1902. Wu Xin was born in Shanghai County. He went to Nanyang Public School (Now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in 1897 and graduated three years later. In the traditional Chinese society, the prejudice that \\"Mediocrity is the virtue of women.\\" was ingrained, and women had no right to enjoy education. Witnessing women's poor condition under the feudal society, Wu Xin determined to found an academy dedicated to female education. On 24 October 1902, Wu Xin named his family school Wu Pen Girls' School and began enrolling students publicly since then. Miss Shen Zhushu was hired as school counsellor. Wu Pen Girls' School was the first girls' school founded by Chinese. There were only 7 students and 2 grades in the beginning. Due to the high quality of education, the enrollment started to increase sharply. In 1913, Wu Xin donated the school to Shanghai County government. In August 1937, the campus was destroyed by the Japanese Army in World War II. Wu Pen Girls' School was renamed Huaijiu Junior High School for Girls (ÊÄÄ‰πÖÂ•≥Â≠ê‰∏≠Â≠¶, formerly 77 Route Pichon) after the attack, and the school set up a board. In 1942, Japanese Army occupied Shanghai concessions. The school was forced to close. After the war ended in 1945, Wu Pen Girls' School reopened. In 1949, Shanghai was occupied by China Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War. Wu Pen Girls' School was then renamed Shanghai No.2 Girls' High School in 1952.

It is to be distinguished from an arranged marriage, where the parties do not select their partners but there is free choice to accept or decline the marriage. Forced marriage is widely recognised as a human rights abuse, with some commentators considering it a form of slavery. Prevalence of forced marriage in New Zealand There is a lack of reliable statistics on rates of forced marriage in New Zealand. Some international reports considering the issue have relied on rates of registered marriages in New Zealand in which one party was under the age of 18. In 2013 there were 57 registered marriages in which one party was under the age of 18, consisting of 0.29% of registered marriages that year. However while many forced marriages involve a party under the age of 18, i.e. a minor participant, not all marriages involving a minor are forced marriages. It is also widely recognised that many forced marriages may occur within ethnic or religious communities and derive their legitimacy from community recognition. As such marriages are viewed as legitimate by the community, they are often not registered and are difficult to track. Community groups such as Shakti, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that works to reduce domestic violence in migrant communities, have anecdotal evidence of forced marriage occurring in New Zealand. Higher rates of forced marriages have been found in Auckland in comparison to other urban centres, reflecting the higher concentration of African, Asian and Middle Eastern ethnic groups in Auckland (communities in which forced marriage is more likely to occur). However it is widely accepted that Shakti's anecdotal evidence does not truly reflect the extent of forced marriage in New Zealand, as many victims of forced marriage do not report their abuse and may be isolated within their own communities. Current legislative framework =Requirement of consent= Under section 17 of the Marriage Act 1955, a marriage cannot take place if a party is under 16 years of age.Marriage Act 1955, section 17 Sexual activity with a person under 16 years of age is also illegal.Crimes Act 1961, section 134 . In addition to this, current New Zealand law requires that one party to a registered marriage sign a statutory declaration stating that there is free consent to the marriage.Marriage Act 1955, section 20 . There is no requirement that both parties individually indicate that they have both consented to the marriage. The legislative requirement of explicit consent of only one party has been criticised by some scholars, who suggest that in forced marriages the consenting (and not forced) party will simply sign the declaration and thus suggest falsely that consent existed.Priyanca Radhakrishnan \\"Unholy Matrimony: Forced Marriage in New Zealand\\" (Masters Thesis, 2012) at 86. . Parental consent is additionally required before the marriage of minors aged 16 or 17.Marriage Act 1955, section 18 . However, in many cases forced marriages are supported and arranged by parents and thus this requirement of parental consent does not protect the free consent of minors. =Criminal provisions= There is currently no specific provision prohibiting forced marriage in New Zealand, but prosecution of those who force marriages may take place under several criminal offence provisions. Many scholars identify a likely avenue for prosecution as section 208 of the Crimes Act 1961 ('Abduction for purposes of marriage or sexual connection'). Additionally there may be liability under other provisions in the Crimes Act 1961 such as section 98 ('Dealing in Slaves'). It is however alleged that such provisions do not adequately address the issue of forced marriage. For example, a genuine mistaken belief in consent is a defence to section 208 liability and it may be hard to prove that such a mistaken belief did not exist. =Declaring a marriage invalid due to duress= Section 31 of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 also provides that a marriage may be declared invalid if there was duress upon entry into the marriage.Family Proceedings Act 1980, section 31 . This may allow victims of a forced marriage to have the marriage invalidated. The UN's Working Group on Women's Rights has promoted the availability of such legislation for victims of forced marriages who are minors in order to recognise the inappropriateness of forced marriage.Working Group on Women's Rights \\"Report of the Working Group on the Issue of Discrimination Against Women in Law and in Practice\\" (2015) (A/HRC/29/40) at 27 . Despite the existence of section 31, the courts have been unwilling to use this provision in practice because they have rarely made a finding of duress upon entry into marriage. In H v H, the claimant requested a voiding of the marriage ab initio due to duress under section 31.H v H [1997] NZFLR 145 at 146. Consent had allegedly been removed because of family pressure to comply with the marriage. The Court referred to the applicant as having feelings of fear about 'displeasure, disgrace and ostracism'. However the Court refused to find that there had been duress leading to the marriage because the respondent was not underage, was raised in New Zealand, and was 'intelligent and relatively sophisticated'.H v H [1997] NZFLR 145 at 148. The Court found that the applicant had simply desired to respect her culture, please her family and avoid embarrassment. Critically, the Court held that many marriages are not based on love and thus that feelings of wanting to please family were a normal part of a decision to marry.H v H [1997] NZFLR 145 at 149. In Ali v Abbas, an application for voiding of a marriage based on duress was also not upheld.Ali v Abbas [2000] NZFLR 303 at 310. Evidence that the applicant was prompted to marry through fear of alienation and persecution was again rejected. Although the courts did not find duress in family pressure to consent to the marriage, it is acknowledged that family pressure may in fact lead to a forced marriage. International obligations New Zealand is party to a number of international obligations to end forced marriage. It is a signatory to various conventions that protect free consent to marriage. Examples include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (article 16(2)),Universal Declaration of Human Rights . the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (article 23(3)),International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (article 16(1)(b)),Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women . and the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages (article 1(1)).Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages . All these provisions are similar and emphasise the requirement of free consent to marriage for both men and women. Additionally, the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires signatories to prevent sexual abuse against children (article 19) and end practices that prejudice children (article 24(3)).Convention on the Rights of the Child . Altogether, these obligations require New Zealand to take appropriate steps to prevent forced marriage from occurring.Claire Green \\"Forced and Underage Marriages: A Pressing Human Rights Issue in New Zealand?\\" (2015) 8 NZFLJ 96 at 97. =Forced marriage as a form of slavery= The UN Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has identified forced marriage as a form of slavery. New Zealand is also a signatory to the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery. This prohibits slavery and institutions and practices akin to slavery.Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery . Article 1(c) suggests that the forced giving of a woman in marriage, without her consent, is a practice akin to slavery and should be therefore outlawed. Other scholars have suggested that the prohibition on slavery may be a jus cogens norm of international law, and that therefore New Zealand must take immediate action to end the practice of forced marriage. =Soft law obligations= In addition to New Zealand's binding convention obligations, New Zealand has participated in the creation of various soft law documents that encourage actions to be taken to stop forced marriage. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 71/175 recognises the problem of forced marriage and emphasises the importance of free consent to marriage as a human right.United Nations General Assembly Resolution 71/175 . Number 5 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals includes the removal of practices harmful to women, such as early and forced marriage.UN Sustainable Development Goals (2015) No. 5 \\"Improve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls\\" . Treaty body reporting and international commentary Treaty body reporting on New Zealand's progress in reducing incidences of forced marriage has not been favourable. A 2012 Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women report noted that there was significant concern about lack of legislation to prevent forced marriage and uphold the rights of those who are affected by forced marriage. These concerns were echoed in a 2016 Committee on the Rights of the Child report, which recommended that New Zealand reform legislation to prohibit all marriages under the age of 18. The 2016 Committee on the Rights of the Child report additionally recommended that programs be developed to raise awareness of the issue of forced marriage. In addition to direct treaty body reporting to New Zealand, UN organs have released a number of statements about the importance of reducing forced marriage rates. The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women released General Recommendation No. 35 in 2017, which recognised forced marriage as a form of gender-based violence and recommended the repeal of any provision that permitted this. This was an echo of a much earlier Recommendation in 1994 (No. 21), which again recommended that states take all measures to ensure that there is free consent to marriage and that children were not parties to marriages. A 2015 report by the Working Group on Women's Rights called for a number of efforts to be made to reduce incidences of forced marriage, and appropriately care for victims of forced marriages by invalidating such marriages and protecting custody of children, the right to remarry, and matrimonial assets.Working Group on Women's Rights \\"Report of the Working Group on the Issue of Discrimination Against Women in Law and in Practice\\" (2015) (A/HRC/29/40) . In addition the Commission on the Status of Women presented a number of agreed conclusions in 2013, one of which included the importance of ending forced marriage.Commission on the Status of Women \\"Agreed Conclusions\\" (2013) (E/CN.6/2013/11) . Cultural rights issue Although most international practice seems to speak against forced marriage, some states allege that forced marriage is primarily a cultural practice. Therefore communities would have a right to continue to practice forced marriage. During the creation of the Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages Convention, Pakistan's signatory argued that requiring consent to marriage was an inappropriate interference with cultural rights protected under Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However this argument has not been favoured in other rights documents and it seems likely that it is appropriate to limit cultural rights in order to protect the fundamental right of consent to marriage. Domestic responses to international commentary In 2014, New Zealand submitted a report as part of its reporting for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The report highlights various strategies which have been taken to ensure that New Zealand meets its international obligations to end forced marriage, including multi-organisational efforts to increase understanding and raise awareness about the issue. In 2012, government agencies such as Child, Youth and Family (New Zealand), Work and Income, Family and Community Services, the Ministry of Education (New Zealand), New Zealand Police and Immigration New Zealand developed a collaborative response to the issue. In 2014, New Zealand responded to various recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women to the 7th periodic report of New Zealand. In response to the recommendation of raising the age of marriage to 18, New Zealand suggested that such an act would be discriminatory against those aged 16 or 17 who genuinely wish to marry. New Zealand also identified a number of positive steps that had already been taken to reduce forced marriage rates, including raising awareness about the issue, providing education about the issue, and being in open dialogue with the Indian High Commission and Shakti. Proposed legislative reform =2009 parliamentary petition= In 2009 a parliamentary petition requesting greater legislative protection against forced marriage was introduced by Jane Prichard.Parliamentary Petition No. 2008/52 . This was addressed by a Justice and Electoral Committee Report published in 2011.Report of Justice and Electoral Committee on Petition 2008/52 . The report acknowledged the difficulty in regulating unregistered, community-approved marriages, and encouraged community faith leaders to be registered as marriage celebrants in order to encourage registration of all marriages. However, the report did not promote legislation that directly prohibited forced marriage. =Family and Whanau Violence Legislation Bill= In 2017, numerous legislative amendments were introduced under the Family and Whanau Violence Legislation Bill.Family and Whanau Violence Legislation Bill Information . Section 97 of the bill includes a new proposed section 207A addition to the Crimes Act 1961.Family and Whanau Violence Legislation Bill, section 97 . The new section 207A would create liability for those who coerce others into a marriage or a civil union. Notably, the provision also applies to marriages that have not been solemnised and so would therefore create liability for unregistered but community-recognised forced marriages. The bill is currently onto its second reading. Legislative reform =Minors (Court Consent to Relationships) Legislation Act= In 2012, a private member's bill, the Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill, was submitted by National Party MP Jackie Blue to address the problem of forced marriages of 16- and 17-year-olds. There are about 80 applications per year for marriages between 16- and 17-year-olds. After Blue left Parliament, the bill was picked up by fellow National MP Jo Hayes and was eventually drawn from the ballot on the 13 April 2017.Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill 2017 Information . The Bill proposed that those aged 16 or 17 must apply to the Family Court for the consent of a Family Court Judge, replacing the previous requirement of parental consent to the marriage, and set out how the court is to consider the application.Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill 2017 . Submissions in favour of the Bill were made by groups such as the Human Rights Commission, and the New Zealand Law Society.Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill 2017 Submissions . The Office of the Children's Commissioner disagreed with this Bill, holding that it would unfairly impact on the rights of parents and would not truly address the issue of forced marriage.Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill 2017 Office of the Children's Commissioner submission . At the Select Committee stage, the bill was broadened to cover civil unions and de facto relationships in addition to marriages and was retitled the Minors (Court Consent to Relationships) Legislation Bill. The select committee reported on the 18 May 2018. The bill passed its second reading on the 27 June and third reading on the 8 August, and receiving Royal Assent on the 13 August 2018 came into force the following day.
